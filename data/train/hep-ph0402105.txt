    "the standard model ( sm ) includes three different types of fundamental interactions : electromagnetic , weak and strong ones .",
    "the corresponding forces arise due to an exchange of spin-1 gauge bosons , described by four - vector fields @xmath3 . for the completeness of sm",
    "at least one more scalar boson is required . however , due to its weak coupling to the ordinary matter and its big mass , this particle has not been detected yet by experiments .",
    "meanwhile , the existence of many other bosons has been predicted theoretically and tested experimentally .",
    "the supersymmetry , for example , suggests a rich variety of new particles , which , however , have not been yet observed experimentally .    in this letter",
    "we show that the recent pibeta result  @xcite for the radiative pion decays ( rpd ) @xmath4 indicates that a different kind of fundamental spin-1 _ chiral bosons _ may be present in nature .",
    "they have not been discussed intensively in literature till now .",
    "these particles were first mentioned as a different type of spin-1 bosons in ref .",
    "they appear naturally in the analysis of possible yukawa couplings of  spin-1 bosons to fermion currents . in the relativistic physics ,",
    "where two different types of spin-1/2 fermions exist , namely left - handed @xmath5 and right - handed , two different types of lorentz invariant interactions are possible : _  la gauge _ vector interactions @xmath6 and tensor interactions @xmath7 where @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 are antisymmetric tensor fields and @xmath10 denotes dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "both the vector fields @xmath3 and the tensor fields @xmath9 describe particles with spin one . however , they interact absolutely differently with matter .",
    "the gauge particles are chirally neutral and , hence , they preserve the helicities of incoming and outgoing fermions . on the contrary , the tensor bosons carry a _",
    "chiral charge _ that leads to helicity flip for the interacting fermions .",
    "moreover , self - interactions of the _ chiral bosons _ exist even for an abelian case , leading to a negative contribution into the  @xmath11-function  @xcite .",
    "an example of the presence of the new kind of _ chiral particles _ in nature is the existence of the axial - vector meson resonance @xmath12 , which has only anomalous tensor interactions ( [ tensor ] ) with quarks . the successful description of the dynamical properties of the hadron systems  @xcite hints that the same phenomenon may have place at the electroweak scale as well , similarly to the gauge - like hadron resonances @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which have served as prototypes for the photon and the weak bosons  @xcite .",
    "the pibeta result confirms the anomaly already observed at the istra facility @xcite for the negative pion decays @xmath15 in flight .",
    "it is remarkable , that these two experiments with absolutely different systematics revealed the same effect : the deficit in prd yield .",
    "moreover , the pibeta experiment has measured simultaneously absolute total @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , as well as partial @xmath19 branching ratios , which are in excellent agreement with sm predictions , with better than 1% accuracy  @xcite . the only deviation from sm",
    "is observed in the high-@xmath0/low-@xmath1 kinematic region exactly where the effect has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "the effect is so big that it can not be explained within sm  @xcite and its supersymmetric extensions  @xcite .",
    "historically various types of _ local _ four - fermion effective interactions have been introduced to test the eventual presence of a new physics . here",
    "we will follow also the phenomenological approach of the effective interactions because the complete theory for the interacting tensor particles is not constructed yet . however , we argue that the effective interactions should include new _ non - local _ momentum dependent tensor interactions , in order to describe the pibeta result without contradiction with the present experimental data .",
    "first of all we define the lorentz structure of the new interactions on the basis of pibeta and istra results . since both collaborations have observed a deficit of events in comparison with sm expectation , it should stem from destructive interference between sm and the new interactions in rpd .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the dominant contribution in rpd comes from the inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) process near the edge @xmath20 of the kinematically allowed region , which include the high-@xmath0/low-@xmath1 kinematic region , where the deficit of the events was observed .",
    "we assume that the new interactions interfere destructively with this process leading to the deficit of events .",
    "hence , the new interactions should have the same chiral structure as ib which is different from interactions .",
    "therefore , they do not interfere with the latter due to the smallness of the electron mass .",
    "this is one of the reasons why such type of interactions are hard to detect and why they have not been observed before .",
    "let us consider all possible current - current interactions which lead to a helicity flip .",
    "there are only three possible lorentz structures obeying this property : scalar , pseudoscalar and tensor currents .",
    "the matrix element of the pion - photon transition for the scalar quark current @xmath21 is zero by kinematic reasons and does not contribute to rpd . on the other hand the contribution of the pseudoscalar quark current to the matrix element of the ordinary pion decay @xmath22 is enormously enhanced in comparison with the standard chirally suppressed contribution , and it is severely constrained by the experimental data  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the matrix element of the tensor quark current @xmath23 is zero by kinematic reasons , and does not contribute directly to the pion decay , thus escaping the experimental constraints .",
    "hence , only less constrained tensor interactions are possible candidates for the explanation of rpd anomaly .",
    "we argue that particularly non - local momentum dependent tensor interactions are responsible for the detected anomaly .    in order to explain the istra anomaly a new quark - lepton tensor interactions @xmath24 with the effective coupling constant @xmath25 have been introduced  @xcite , here @xmath26 .",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath27 determines the strength of the new tensor interactions relative to the ordinary weak interactions , governed by the fermi coupling constant @xmath28 .",
    "although such tensor interactions , introduced ad hoc , can explain the anomaly , it has been pointed out  @xcite that the necessary value of the coupling constant @xmath27 contradicts the ordinary pion decay @xmath29 .",
    "this happens because owing to the electromagnetic radiative corrections the pseudotensor quark current @xmath30 leads to a generation of the pseudoscalar quark current @xmath31 , to which pion decay is very sensitive .",
    "the generation of the pseudotensor term @xmath30 can not be avoided for derivative free local four - fermion interactions even if we have started with a parity conserving quark current @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ lt1 ] ) . owing to the identity @xmath33",
    ", the lagrangian ( [ lt1 ] ) effectively reads @xmath34 where the chiral structure shows itself in the quark current .",
    "the solution of this problem was found in ref .",
    "@xcite via introducing non - local momentum dependent tensor interactions @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the momentum transfer between quark and lepton currents , and @xmath37 are positive dimensionless coupling constants . in this case",
    "the second term in the second row of eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) is no longer equal to zero , despite the different chiral structures in quark and lepton currents . and due to the identity",
    "@xmath38 it can compensate the opposite chiral quark structure of the first term .",
    "then the terms with the pseudotensor quark currents @xmath30 cancel out in eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) , and the tensor current @xmath39 does not contribute to pseudoscalar pion decay because of parity conservation in electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the two different terms in the effective lagrangian ( [ r ] ) come from exchanges of new spin-1 bosons @xmath9 and @xmath40 with opposite chiral charges , which are necessary to avoid a chiral anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the peculiar lorentz structure of the new tensor interactions reflects the lorentz structure of the propagators for the chiral bosons .",
    "this structure can be obtained , for example , from the one - loop radiative corrections to the self - energy of the tensor fields using the interactions ( [ tensor ] ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that in case of dimensionless coupling constants the theory is formally renormalizable and the radiative corrections should reproduce the lorentz structure of the kinetic terms  @xcite in the bare initial lagrangian for the tensor fields .    in general ,",
    "the coupling constants @xmath27 and @xmath41 can be different , however , we assume their equality to avoid the experimental constraint from the ordinary pion decay . in the following",
    "we will keep different notations for the coupling constants in order to compare the effects from the two different lagrangians ( [ lt1 ] ) and ( [ r ] ) .",

    "based on the previous consideration , we discuss now the experimental data and their interpretation . to investigate the most interesting part of rpd , namely the sd radiation , and to extract @xmath58 , all previous experiments  @xcite have been fulfilled in a restricted kinematic region compatible with region @xmath91 of pibeta experiment ( fig .",
    "[ dalitz]a ) , which is an intersection of regions @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    in the fig .",
    "[ dalitz]a the isocurves for pure sm contributions ( @xmath94=@xmath95 ) are shown .",
    "ib contribution dominates near the edge @xmath96 of the kinematically allowed region and sd@xmath97 reaches its maximum near the point @xmath98 , while their interference and sd@xmath99 contribution are small .",
    "almost the whole kinematically allowed region ( fig .",
    "[ dalitz]a ) has been investigated first at istra facility  @xcite . a large deficit of events @xmath100 in comparison with sm prediction has been observed .",
    "even with a poor statistics they were able to establish the kinematic region , where a lack of events occurs .",
    "this region corresponds to the bottom part of region @xmath92 of pibeta experiment , where only the ib and the small sd@xmath99 contributions are expected .",
    "the introduction of the tensor matrix element @xmath67 ( [ mt1 ] ) with @xmath101  @xcite explains the lack of events and leads to a considerable improvement of the @xmath102 .",
    "however , such a big tensor form factor contradicts  @xcite the present experimental data .",
    "moreover , in order to explain the @xmath103 deficit of events in region @xmath92 of pibeta experiment , using the same form ( [ mt1 ] ) for the tensor matrix element , an order of magnitude smaller value of the tensor form factor @xmath104 is required  @xcite .",
    "these different @xmath94 values indicate an inadequate description of the new interaction .",
    "to analyse the problem further , we compare the relative strength of the tensor contribution with respect to sm contribution for two different values of the tensor form factor @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ dalitz]b and [ dalitz]c ) .",
    "the main difference between these two plots is the following : at the biggest value of @xmath105 both negative and positive contributions are present depending on the region , while for @xmath106 the tensor matrix element leads to the only negative contribution into the whole kinematically allowed region .    as one can see from the fig .",
    "[ dalitz]b the tensor contribution with the biggest value @xmath105 affects significantly regions @xmath91 and @xmath93 , besides region @xmath92 .",
    "the latter is in contradiction with pibeta results .",
    "the lowest absolute value of @xmath94 allows to evade this problem but leads to another latent difficulty of @xmath58 determination .    indeed pibeta claims two different values for the ratios of axial to vector form factors @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the first one corresponds to the sm fits  @xcite to the entire data set , while the second  to region @xmath91 data only .",
    "however , the @xmath2 deviation in the branching ratio from sm prediction in region @xmath92 requires an introduction of the new tensor contributions for proper @xmath58 determination . then taking into account the correction for the destructive interference",
    ", the experimental branching ratio in region @xmath91 should be increased .",
    "this increases the @xmath58 value , as follows from the top panel of fig .  4 in ref .",
    "however , if we believe in chpt calculations  @xcite @xmath58 should be decreased in order to approach the lowest value . in other words",
    "the fits made with @xmath95 are inappropriate .",
    "the case @xmath109 allows to describe both istra and pibeta anomalies as well , without contradiction to the experimental data .",
    "the corresponding tensor contribution has a slight slope near its zero value ( fig .",
    "[ dalitz]d ) in regions @xmath91 and @xmath93 which is in accordance with pibeta results .",
    "moreover , contrary to pibeta fit , mainly the positive contribution in region @xmath91 leads to the right direction for @xmath58 correction , corresponding to decreasing its value . while the tensor contribution can lead up to 40% deficit in region @xmath92 .",
    "the nonzero form factors @xmath94 and @xmath110 indicate an existence of the quark - lepton tensor interactions ( [ r ] ) with the coupling constant @xmath111 .",
    "although such type of interactions can be generated through radiative corrections , it is impossible to get the tensor coupling constant to be larger than @xmath112 in sm and @xmath113 in its susy extensions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the particular form ( [ r ] ) can not arise as a result of fierz transformations from a leptoquark exchange  @xcite as well .",
