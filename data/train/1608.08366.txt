    "the first exact law for incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence is the so - called von krmn - howarth equation , which relates the time evolution of the second - order correlation velocity tensor to the divergence of the third - order correlation velocity tensor @xcite . under the assumption of isotropy and homogeneity",
    ", @xcite found this exact result , which is considered as one of the cornerstones of turbulence theories ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the most important consequence of the von krmn - howarth equation is the `` four - fifth '' law , which predicts a linear scaling for the longitudinal two - point third - order velocity structure function with the distance between the two points . as a consequence ,",
    "this exact scaling law puts strong boundaries to the nonlinear dynamics of turbulent flows .",
    "following similar formalism of @xcite , similar exact laws have been derived under the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of the turbulent fluctuations for helical hydrodynamic @xcite , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) @xcite , helical mhd @xcite , hall - mhd ( hmhd ) @xcite , electron - mhd approximation ( emhd ) @xcite and lagragian averaged models @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have derived the von krmn - howarth equation for a 3d incompressible two - fluid plasma and the equivalent of the hydrodynamic four - fifth law . however , in all those derivations the assumption of isotropy limits the applicability of the laws , in particular , in magnetized ( space or laboratory ) plasmas .",
    "indeed , in those plasmas , e.g. the solar wind , the presence of a non - zero mean magnetic field introduced a privileged direction of space , which in turn influences the statistical properties of the turbulence such as the spatial correlation function  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this results in having different scaling properties along and perpendicular to the local mean field  @xcite .",
    "therefore , general exact laws that go beyond the assumption of spatial isotropy are needed to study the nonlinear dynamics in turbulent space plasmas , in particular , when comparing to _ in - situ _ spacecraft obervations .",
    "@xcite have derived an exact law for the two - point correlation function associated with the total energy in 3d compressible isothermal hydrodynamic ( hd ) turbulence , without the assumption of isotropy .",
    "the authors found the presence of new types of terms in the inertial range ( other than the yaglom - like flux terms ) , which play the role of sources or sinks for the mean energy transfer . in the same line of research",
    ", they derived an exact law for compressible isothermal mhd turbulence using the two - point correlation function associated with the total energy @xcite .",
    "recent works have studied scaling laws for correlation functions associated with the total energy @xcite and the magnetic ( and generalized ) helicity @xcite for the hmhd model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these exact scaling laws give accurate measures of the mean transfer rate ( of the particular ideal invariant ) , which is an essential quantity to characterize a turbulent system . in the present paper ,",
    "we derive exact scaling laws for the two - point correlation functions associated with each ideal invariant of a 3d incompressible and homogeneous two - fluid plasma , without the assumption of isotropy .",
    "the two - fluid model used in this work is derived from the general two - fluid equations when the non - relativistic and the quasi - neutrality approximation are used .",
    "these two assumptions correspond to neglecting the displacement current in the maxwell - ampre equation  @xcite , which filters out the three high frequency ( optic ) eigenmodes of the general two - fluid equations .",
    "the resulting ( reduced ) two - fluid model still retains small scale effects that are the hall term and electron inertia .",
    "the incompressibility assumption is further used ; thus the resulting model does not include either compressible modes or finite larmor radius effects . in the linear limit ,",
    "the system supports two propagating modes at high frequency , generally referred to as whistler ( right - handed ) and alfvn mode ( left - handed ) , which become degenerate in the mhd limit . the retained ( hall and electron inertia ) terms introduce new spatial and temporal scales into the theoretical plasma description ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which are respectively the ion and electron gyrofrequencies and inertial lengths .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the two - fluid description includes mhd , hmhd and emhd models , which can be regarded as particular cases in the proper asymptotic limits .",
    "for instance , at length scales larger than the ion inertial length , the hall effect and electron inertia can be neglected . at those largest scales ,",
    "the mhd description is appropriate . at spatial scales comparable or smaller than the ion - skin depth",
    ", the ions are no longer frozen - in to the magnetic field lines because of the hall current term . at these intermediate scales ,",
    "the hmhd description becomes valid and has been extensively studied both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite . in the very high frequency limit of the two - fluid model",
    ", ions can be considered as motionless ( because of their large mass with respect to electrons ) and provide a neutralizing background , while the electrons carry the full electric current .",
    "this approximation corresponds to the emhd model , and is asymptotically valid at spatial scales comparable or smaller than electron inertial length . in conclusion ,",
    "the two - fluid description used in this work retains the whole dynamics of both the ion and electron flows from the mhd down to the electron inertial length scales , within the non - relativistics , quasi - neutrality and incompressibility approximations .    using a recent alternative formulation @xcite",
    ", we derive exact scaling laws for the three ideal invariants of a 3d incompressible and homogeneous two - fluid plasma .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follow , section [ model ] introduces the 3d incompressible two - fluid model and section [ ideal_inv ] its ideal invariants . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our main theoretical results for each ideal invariant , namely the total energy , the electron helicity and the proton helicity . in section [ disc ]",
    "we discuss the implications of the derived exact scaling laws , and finally , we provide a summary of the results in section [ conclus ] .",

    "note that these fluid equations do not include any kinetic plasma dissipation mechanisms ( e.g. , wave - particle interactions ) due to either electrons or ions .",
    "the incompressibility assumption implies , @xmath14 equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) can be written in dimensionless form in terms of a typical length @xmath15 , the particle density @xmath16 , a typical velocity @xmath17 ( the alfvn velocity , where @xmath18 is a typical value of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) , and with the electric field in units of @xmath21 , @xmath22 where we have introduced the dimensionless parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 has the form of a plasma frequency for a particle of mass @xmath26 . dimensionless ion and electron skin - depth can be defined in terms of their corresponding plasma frequencies @xmath27 simply as @xmath28 , and their expressions in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are simply @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that in the limit of electron inertia equal to zero , we obtain @xmath33 , which correspond to the usual hall parameter @xcite . finally , to obtain a hydrodynamic description of the two - fluid plasma",
    ", we can write * * u**@xmath34 and * * u**@xmath35 in terms of two vector fields ( see @xcite ) : the hydrodynamic velocity @xmath36 , and @xmath10 as given by eq .  .",

    "if we define the electron and proton vector potentials @xmath44 equations and can be cast in a compact expressions as @xmath45 where @xmath46 it is worth mentioning that in the hmhd limit , i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the conservation of the electron helicity and proton helicity corresponds to the conservation of the magnetic helicity and generalized helicity , respectively @xcite .",

    "the property of spatial homogeneity implies that all regions of space are similar so far as the statistical properties are concerned , which suggests that the results of averaging over a large number of realizations at different positions in space could be obtained equally well by averaging over a large region of space for one realization @xcite .",

    ", we recover the exact laws recently reported by @xcite for the total energy . assuming isotropy and equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energy , expression can be used to provide theoretical predictions for the magnetic energy spectrum in a turbulent plasma . in particular , at mhd scales ( @xmath91 )",

    "figure [ 1 ] shows a summary of our theoretical predictions for the magnetic energy spectrum , which emerges from the exact law .",
    "this spectrum is roughly consistent with solar wind observations  @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that : i ) theoretical predictions for the magnetic energy spectrum is strongly dependent of the ratio between magnetic and kinetic energy @xcite ; ii ) the actual scaling of the magnetic energy spectra in the solar wind , in particular near and below the electron scale , is still an open question that can not be resolved unambiguously with the current spacecraft data due to instrumental limitations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fate of the turbulent cascade and the resulting dissipation at those small scales is a crucial subject , which is deeply related to the problems particle heating and acceleration in solar wind and in many other astrophysical plasmas @xcite .",
    "our exact results provide a way to estimate the transfer rate of the total energy ( and other invariants ) over a broad ranges of scales .",
    "application of the exact laws to spacecraft data should therefore inform us about the amount of energy transfered separately into ions and electrons .     up to the dissipation wavenumber @xmath100 . ]    regarding the electron helicity and proton helicity , using definitions and , equations and can be written as , @xmath101 when @xmath47 and @xmath71 , from both expressions we recover the mhd results for the magnetic helicity @xcite .",
    "assuming isotropy and a maximal helicity state , the corresponding magnetic helicity spectrum is @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "at hmhd scales , exact scaling laws and correspond to the exact laws for the magnetic and generalized helicity , respectively . in particular , this feature is consistent with the polarization associated with each helicity found recently by @xcite . besides , assuming a transfer time @xmath103 for intermediate scales , we obtain @xmath104 in the maximal helicity state .    at the smallest scales , where one can assume @xmath105 , equation does not provide new useful information about the proton helicity .",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of electron helicity depends strongly of the ratio between magnetic and kinetic energy .",
    "for instance , at scales proportional to @xmath106 one can assume that the electron kinetic energy is dominant .",
    "since the transfer time is @xmath107 , the electron helicity spectrum corresponds to @xmath108 , which is the same theoretical prediction for the massless emhd limit @xcite . in particular , in this scenario where the electron kinetic energy is dominant ( and the magnetic energy is negligible ) , the equation of motion of electrons is similar to the classical 3d hydrodynamic euler equation ( where kinetic energy and kinetic helicity are the two ideal invariants ) . in this hydrodynamic case ,",
    "if the large scales of the flow are helical , then should be a joint cascade of both energy and helicity to small scales @xcite .",
    "in particular , numerical results strongly support that the magnetic and helicity spectra have the same slope , i.e. @xmath109 @xcite . however , we do not obtain the same slope for both invariants .",
    "this result is related to the transfer time of electron helicity at length scales proportional to @xmath32 due to the presence of two different species in the plasma .",
    "numerical simulation of 3d incompressible and homogeneous two - fluid plasmas could shed light ontot some aspects of the nonlinear dynamics of the electron helicity at these smallest scales .    finally , as we discussed it in the introduction , in many cases symmetries with preferred directions have direct impact on the structure of exact scaling laws . therefore , if we consider the presence of a mean magnetic field @xmath110 , exact laws , and are modified as , @xmath111 + { \\textbf{u}_{e}}\\cdot[{\\textbf{u}_{e}}'\\times(\\textbf{h}_e'+\\textbf{b}_0)]\\right > \\\\ \\nonumber & - \\left<{\\textbf{u}_{p}}'\\cdot[{\\textbf{u}_{p}}\\times(\\textbf{h}_p+\\textbf{b}_0 ) ] + { \\textbf{u}_{p}}\\cdot[{\\textbf{u}_{p}}'\\times(\\textbf{h}_p'+\\textbf{b}_0)\\big\\}\\right > \\\\   \\label{mean1 }   & = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}[\\left<\\delta({\\textbf{u}_{p}}\\times\\textbf{h}_p)\\cdot\\delta{\\textbf{u}_{p}}\\right>-\\left<\\delta({\\textbf{u}_{e}}\\times\\textbf{h}_e)\\cdot\\delta{\\textbf{u}_{e}}\\right > ] ,",
