    "linear response theory ( lrt ) is one most useful tools of statistical physics and condensed matter theory , both classical and quantum , treated in detail in most textbook @xcite .",
    "the success of kubo formulas @xcite in describing the response of a system weakly perturbed out of equilibrium is well known .",
    "its realm of application goes from transport coefficients in electronic systems @xcite to relaxation phenomena in normal liquids , superfluids and magnetic system @xcite .",
    "the theory , which is most easily formulated in the quantum case , expresses the response of the average value at time @xmath1 of an observable @xmath2 for a system whose hamiltonian @xmath3 is weakly perturbed by a term @xmath4 in terms of ( retarded ) response functions @xmath5 ; the @xmath5 s , also known as susceptibilities , are in turn expressed in terms of equilibrium averages of commutators of the heisenberg s operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the time evolution is assumed to be perfectly unitary ( coherent ) and governed by the equilibrium hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "one of the well known properties of lrt is that it predicts a response which is in general `` out - of - phase '' with the perturbation  the fourier transformed susceptibilities @xmath8 have imaginary parts  and this is generally associated to _ energy absorption _ :",
    "the systems takes energy from the driving forces at a positive rate controlled by the imaginary part of the appropriate response functions @xcite .",
    "admittedly , some of the ingredients in the standard derivations of kubo formulas  like for instance the assumption , in the quantum case , of a perfectly `` coherent '' evolution  are not easy to justify , at least on the macroscopic time - scales over which the results are succesfully applied .",
    "van kampen has even harshly criticized the whole theory as a `` mathematical exercise '' @xcite trying to bridge the huge time - gap between the expected linearity at the macroscopic scale with an unjustified assumption of linearity in the microscopic equations of motion . even without taking such an extreme view",
    " after all , this `` mathematical exercise '' is remarkably successfull  one could still try to test the regime of validity of linear response in the time - domain , in a setting in which a coherent evolution is guaranteed : this might apply both to experiments on cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite as well as to more conventional condensed matter system studied by ultra - fast spectroscopies  @xcite where the dynamics of a system in the sub - pico - second range is likely not affected by the interaction with the environment .",
    "an ideal testing ground for lrt is the coherent unitary evolution of a closed many - body quantum system subject to a periodic driving , where a floquet analysis @xcite can be applied provided the usual adiabatic switching - on factors are avoided . in a recent work  @xcite",
    ", we have considered such a problem for a one - dimensional ising model in a time - dependent uniform transverse field @xmath9 , and found that the response of the system to a periodic driving of @xmath9 results  after a transient and in the thermodynamic limit  in a periodic behaviour of the averages of the observables . when considering the transverse magnetization",
    "after the transient , in particular , this periodic behaviour turned out to be `` synchronized '' in - phase with the perturbating transverse field , in such a way as to have zero energy absorbed from the driving over a cycle .",
    "though we have exemplified these ideas using a quantum ising chain , we have argued for their more general validity under circumstances which could be fairly applicable to closed quantum many - body systems on a lattice in absence of disorder @xcite .",
    "a question is however in order at this point : `` synchronization '' implies that the out - of - phase response typically associated ( within lrt ) to energy absorption and the imaginary part of the response functions , vanish .",
    "what is the physics behind this effect ?",
    "this is precisely the issue addressed by the present paper , where we plan to compare  again , for definiteness , in the quantum ising chain  the results of an exact floquet analysis in a regime of weak periodic driving of the transverse field with the outcome of lrt .",
    "we consider both the case of a perturbation which is extensive , i.e. , involving a number of sites @xmath10 which increases as the system size @xmath11 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath12 but @xmath13 ) , as well as that of a local perturbation , where @xmath10 of order @xmath14 .",
    "for the case of an extensive perturbation , we find that the results of lrt are applicable only at short times , and emerge from a rather singular limit in the strength of the perturbation .",
    "lrt would predict a constant energy absorbtion at a rate proportional to the imaginary part of the corresponding response function . for any small but finite perturbation ,",
    "the true response shows in turn the linear - in - time energy absorption predicted by lrt only at short times , while eventually at longer times the true energy absorption rate vanishes .",
    "correspondingly , of the two components of the lrt , `` in - phase '' and `` out - of - phase '' only the former survives in the asymptotic limit , corresponding to the `` synchronization '' of the system with the perturbation .",
    "interestingly , contrary to the dissipative component , the strength of the `` in - phase '' response turns out to be well described by lrt .",
    "this is essentially consistent with what is known in the context of mesoscopic physics about the origin of resistance and energy dissipation in small metallic loops subject to a time - dependent magnetic flux ( a uniform electric field ) : as discussed by landauer @xcite and by gefen and thouless @xcite , due to phase coherence , zener tunneling between bands does not imply energy dissipation but rather energy storage @xcite , and elastic scattering due to localized potentials will generally lead to a saturation of the energy absorbed by the system @xcite , without resistance ( inelastic effects are essential for that ) . in our case",
    ", we find that in order to describe accurately also the dissipative response with linear response theory the system should act `` as its own bath '' .",
    "this happens , for example , when the weak perturbation / driving acts _ locally _ in a finite region @xmath10 of order @xmath14 : in this case we find that lrt is essentially exact at all times @xmath1 , as @xmath15 : the system can accomodate a linear - in - time energy increase ( of order @xmath14 ) even for @xmath16 , as this adds a vanishingly small contribution to the energy - per - site , of order @xmath17 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ linear - response : sec ]",
    "we briefly review the lrt , for the reader s convenience , and present the slightly less common lrt calculation for a perfectly periodic perturbation without adiabatic switching - on factors . in section [ floquet : sec ] we present the floquet analysis of a finite amplitude perturbation , and the arguments leading to an asymptotically periodic behaviour introduced in ref .",
    "section [ energy : sec ] contains some general energy considerations leading to the conclusions that the true response often lacks the `` out - of - phase '' part predicted by lrt , in particular at least when the perturbation is extensive and the model has a finite bandwidth single - particle spectrum . in section [ ising : sec ]",
    "we exemplify these general considerations with a quantum ising chain subject to a time - periodic transverse field .",
    "we will show , section [ comparison_l = l : sec ] , that , while the lrt response proportional to the real part of @xmath8 is perfectly matching the exact floquet results for small driving , the out - of - phase response due to the imaginary part of @xmath8 is , strictly speaking , missing at large times . in section [ subchain : sec ]",
    "we discuss the case of a perturbation which extends spatially over a segment of the chain of length @xmath10 , analysing the case in which @xmath18 remains constant in the thermodynamic limit ( an extensive perturbation ) , contrasting it with the case in which @xmath10 remains constant ( a local perturbation ) , where lrt is asymptotically exact .",
    "section [ conclusions : sec ] contains a summary of our results , a discussion of their experimental relevance , both for cold atoms in optical lattices and for ultra - fast spectroscopies , and our conclusions .",
    "four appendices contain some technical material on the analysis of the singularities of lrt , on the transverse magnetic susceptibility of the quantum ising chain , and on the bogoliubov - de gennes - floquet dynamics of a general inhomogeneous quantum ising chain .",
    "let us start with a brief recap of lrt , as discussed in most textbooks  @xcite .",
    "assume that the equilibrium hamiltonian @xmath19 of a given system is weakly perturbed @xmath20 where @xmath21 is some hermitean operator and @xmath22 a ( weak ) perturbing field . at equilibrium",
    ", the system would be governed by a thermal ( gibbs ) density matrix at a ( possibly vanishing ) temperature @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the eigenstates of @xmath19 , @xmath26 the corresponding eigenenergies , and @xmath27 the partition sum .",
    "lrt tells us how to calculate the ( perturbed ) expectation value of any operator @xmath28 at time @xmath1 , @xmath29 , to linear order in the perturbation @xmath22 , assuming a coherent ( unitary ) evolution governed by @xmath30 . restricting our considerations to the case @xmath31 , we know that @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 $ ] is the equilibrium value , and the retarded susceptibility @xmath34 is given by : @xmath35\\right\\rangle}_{\\rm eq }    = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\theta(t ) \\sum_{n , m}\\left(\\rho_m-\\rho_n\\right ) \\left| a_{m n}\\right|^2 { \\textrm{e}}^{-i\\omega_{n m}t } \\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . the relevant information on the susceptibility is contained in its spectral function @xmath39 which is , essentially , the imaginary part of the fourier - transform @xmath40 for @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and is manifestly _ odd",
    ". we will always assume ( unless otherwise stated ) that we are dealing with an extended system in the thermodynamic limit , so that @xmath45 is a smooth function of @xmath46 , rather than a sum of discrete dirac s delta functions .",
    "consider now the case of a perfectly periodic perturbation of frequency @xmath47 , for definiteness @xmath48 .",
    "the standard textbook approach would include an adiabatic switching - on of the perturbation from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , writing @xmath51 $ ] , with a small positive @xmath52 which is eventually sent to @xmath50 at the end of the calculation . since we are interested in comparing lrt with a floquet approach , we insist on a strictly periodic perturbation turned - on at @xmath53 , and take @xmath54 .",
    "the calculation of the response to such a perturbation is an elementary application of eqs .",
    "( [ valtim]-[chisec ] ) , and gives : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "( a word of caution on the notation : @xmath57 is the response to the periodic driving @xmath58 , but is not itself periodic in time . ) we notice that , although the usual @xmath59 factors do not appear anywhere , the integrand in eq . is regular , nothwithstanding the singular denominators at @xmath60 , because the limits for @xmath61 are finite : there is no need , therefore , for a cauchy principal value prescription .",
    "if we split the two contributions appearing in the numerators , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , into two separate integrals , however , the singularity of the two denominators at @xmath60 will require a principal value prescription for both . by using the fact that @xmath45 is odd ,",
    "one readily finds : @xmath64 where we have introduced the kramers - krnig transform @xmath65 @xmath66 i.e. , see eq .  , the real part of @xmath67 on the upper real axis @xcite .",
    "a few comments are in order here . the riemann - lebesgue lemma @xcite states that fourier transforms of a regular function @xmath68 ( such that @xmath69 be lebesgue - integrable ) approach @xmath50 for large times @xmath70 physically",
    ", this result follows from dephasing associated to the overlap of the rapidly oscillating ( for large @xmath1 ) phase - factors @xmath71 weighting the `` smooth '' @xmath68 .",
    "the frequency integral appearing in the second term of eq .",
    ", however , has a singularity at @xmath72 , which should be treated by the principal value prescription whenever @xmath73 .",
    "this singularity does not allow a straightforward application of the riemann - lebesgue lemma , and leads to a large-@xmath1 value of the integral which does not decay to @xmath50 . indeed , as explained in [ singularity - lr :",
    "app ] , it is a simple matter to `` extract '' the singularity from the integral , by isolating a term proportional to @xmath74 , which turns out to have the familiar form @xmath75 , plus a regular ( transient ) term @xmath76 , ending up with the expression : @xmath77 + f^{\\rm trans}(\\omega_0,t )   \\;,\\ ] ] where the transient part @xmath78}{\\omega-\\omega_0 } \\sin{(\\omega t ) }   \\;,\\ ] ] is now vanishing for large @xmath1 , due to the riemann - lebesgue lemma .",
    "therefore , lrt predicts a periodic response composed , at large times of two terms : one in - phase with the perturbation , proportional to @xmath65 , and one out - of - phase with it , proportional to @xmath74 , associated to energy absorption ( see below section  [ energy : sec ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss the case of a periodic perturbation with a finite , but not necessarily small , amplitude . as in  @xcite , the dynamics in this case case can be studied using floquet theory .",
    "let us now , to set the notation , briefly review the basics of floquet theory , referring the reader to the available literature for more details  @xcite .",
    "in case of a time periodic hamiltonian like eq .  , i.e. , @xmath79 with @xmath80 , in analogy with bloch theorem in the standard band theory of crystalline solids , it is possible to construct a complete set of solutions of the schrdinger equation ( the floquet states ) which are periodic in time up to a phase @xmath81 the states @xmath82 , the so - called floquet modes , are periodic , @xmath83 while the real quantities @xmath84 are called floquet quasienergies . if we assume that the system starts in the density matrix @xmath85 , we can expand the density matrix at time @xmath1 in the floquet basis .",
    "exploiting the fact that the floquet states are solutions of the schrdinger equation we see that @xmath86 . defining @xmath87 we can write @xmath88 the mean value of the operator @xmath21 at time @xmath1 is therefore @xmath89 = \\sum_{\\alpha \\beta } { \\textrm{e}}^{-i\\left({\\overline \\mu}_\\alpha-{\\overline \\mu}_\\beta\\right)t }   \\rho_{\\alpha \\beta}(0 ) a_{\\beta\\alpha}(t ) \\;,\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath90 , which is , by construction , a @xmath91-periodic quantity .",
    "we can then divide the previous sum into two parts : a periodic one , originating from diagonal elements , and an extra piece , originating from off - diagonal elements : @xmath92 we can express these two contributions , assuming a non - degenerate floquet spectrum ( @xmath93 if @xmath94 ) , as follows : .",
    "see sec .",

    "quasi_-degenracies tending to strict degeneracies in the thermodynamic limit in the case of a local perturbation . ]",
    "@xmath95 where we have introduced the time - dependent @xmath91-periodic weighted joint density of states @xmath96 suppose we now evaluate @xmath97 at an arbitrary time @xmath98 , where @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath100 , we can readily find that : @xmath101 i.e. , exactly of the form to which the riemann - lebesgue lemma , eq .",
    ", might apply .",
    "if @xmath102 is a sufficiently smooth function of @xmath46 ( such that @xmath103 is lebesgue - integrable ) one would conclude that @xmath104 decays to 0 after a transient , and the resulting large-@xmath1 behaviour of @xmath105 is asymptotically periodic , @xmath106 . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this occurs whenever the floquet spectrum is a continuum ( in the absence of singularities ) .",
    "this vanishing of the fluctuating piece , and the resulting time - periodic response , will be henceforth referred to as `` synchronization '' @xcite .",
    "as we will argue later , this off - diagonal term appears to acquire a singular contribution whenever the driving is local , thus leading to a steady energy absorption which , however , is not extensive ( see sec .  [ energy : sec ] and sec .  [ subchain : sec ] for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "in the following , we will discuss the physics of energy absorbtion in a system described by the generic hamiltonian @xmath107 .",
    "for this sake , it is convenient to define two energy functions : the first , @xmath108 $ ] , is the energy of the original system in the perturbed state @xmath109 , while the other , @xmath110= e_0(t ) + v(t ) { \\left\\langle a\\right\\rangle}_t $ ] , is the total energy including the perturbing - field term . using the fact that a coherent unitary evolution implies @xmath111 $ ] , together with the cyclic property of the trace , it is easy to derive a hellmann - feynmann - like formula : @xmath112 = \\dot{v}(t ) { \\left\\langle a\\right\\rangle}_t \\;.\\ ] ] on the other hand , using @xmath113 , taking a derivative , it is straightforward to conclude that : @xmath114 consider now for definiteness , @xmath115 as in section [ linear - response : sec ] .",

    "evidently , see eq .",
    ", the coefficient @xmath125 of the @xmath126 component is what determines the rate of energy absorption : @xmath127 lrt predicts in the steady state ( after the decay of the transient eq .  ) , an out - of - phase response with @xmath128 , which leads to a steady - state ( @xmath129 ) increase of the energy at a rate @xcite @xmath130 which is positive , since @xmath131 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is well known in the context of mesoscopic physics that whenever a system is closed , energy absorption resulting from an oscillatory perturbation ( for example in disordered mesoscopic rings ) does not correspond to energy dissipation , but rather energy storage  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , in these systems the energy absorption rate , which classically would be constant , tends to decrease at long times as a result of dynamical localization  @xcite .",
    "a steady increase of energy is problematic not only for mesoscopic systems but also for closed system on a lattice , say a fermionic hubbard - like model , the transverse field quantum ising model , or any spin model in any dimension , whenever @xmath21 is an extensive operator .",
    "indeed , by simple arguments one can show that the spectrum of such hamiltonians on a lattice of @xmath132 sites , @xmath133 being the dimensionality of the lattice , should be bounded in a region @xmath134 $ ] , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are appropriate finite lower and upper bounds on the energy - per - site .",
    "if @xmath21 is extensive , then a steady ( @xmath137 ) and extensive ( @xmath138 ) energy increase with a rate @xmath139 , like that predicted by lrt , would inevitably lead to a violation of the boundedness of the spectrum : @xmath140 .",
    "local operators , on the contrary , do not lead to an extensive energy increase , and do not violate any bound . we therefore expect , and explicitly illustrate in the following , that lrt should eventually break down after a while when the perturbation is extensive , even if we are in the thermodynamic limit .    as in the case of mesoscopic systems , also in the case of closed system on a lattice energy absorption",
    "can be hindered .",
    "in particular , this happens if all the observables `` synchronize '' with the perturbing field @xcite by showing , after a transient , a perfectly periodic asymptotic response .",
    "when this happens @xmath141 and @xmath142 , for large @xmath116 , making the energy absorption rate vanish at large times . in this case the response is asymptotically `` in - phase '' with the perturbation : @xmath143 _ without the out - of - phase term _ proportional to @xmath144 .    , for @xmath145 , for a one dimensional transverse field ising model which is perturbed , around the critical point , with a uniform transverse field modulation @xmath146 .",

    "the solid red line represents the energy absorbed per site @xmath151 versus the rescaled time @xmath152 within lrt , for an ising chain whose transverse field is uniformly modulated , around the critical point @xmath153 , by a term @xmath146 with @xmath145 , corresponding to a part of the spectrum where @xmath73 .",

    "we observe that for any small but finite @xmath156 the exact results eventually deviate , for large @xmath1 , from the linear - in-@xmath1 lrt prediction , saturating at large times up to small and larger - scale oscillations .",
    "similar physics apparently emerges , for instance , in a periodically modulated homogeneous one - dimensional hubbard model @xcite , as numerically found through time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) calculations @xcite , see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "the possible experimental relevance of this departure , provided the time - scale for coherent evolution is large enough , is discussed in section [ conclusions : sec ] .",
    "we mention that there are other possible scenarios by which a system can stop absorbing energy indefinitely : one involves a @xmath142 but without a full vanishing of @xmath97 , another a @xmath125 that keeps oscillating around @xmath50 in such a way that @xmath157 remains bounded .",

    "for @xmath10 finite and @xmath15 , the excitations would go on forever , propagating away from the perturbed sector of the chain taking away with them their initial energy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the finite amount of energy delivered to the system in each period spreads over an infinite space : the energy per site deviates always infinitesimally from its initial value , and lrt is consequently obeyed .",
    "we might summarize this discussion by saying that , when the perturbation is local , it is true the common wisdom according to which an extended system acts as `` its own heat bath '' @xcite ; thus the @xmath316 factors appearing in the lrt functions are justified .",
    "when the perturbation is extensive , @xmath317 , the situation is very different .",
    "if we send @xmath15 with @xmath18 constant , the `` reservoir '' @xmath318 has an infinite space over which the excitations can propagate away . on the other hand , as clearly indicated by the results in fig .",
    ", lrt holds only for a finite number of periods which stays finite as @xmath15 , and is obviously much smaller than @xmath319 .",
    "evidently , the number of excitations generated by the driving in each period and the `` reservoir''-space in which they can propagate scale both with @xmath11 : the `` reservoir '' , therefore , steadily increases its energy - per - site and the perturbation to the density matrix of the system will cease to be small : hence the failure of lrt , at least as far as @xmath320 is concerned .",
    "surprisingly , such a failure of lrt is accompanied by an excellent agreement of the @xmath321-response .",
    "we have evidence that essentially the same picture holds for all cases with @xmath18 finite .    one final remark concerning the local perturbation case is in order .",
    "assume , for definiteness , that we perturb the system on a single site , @xmath322 , and calculate the corresponding @xmath105 .",

    "[ aver - per]-[aver - fluc]-[outofdiag ] , which in principle involve many - body matrix elements and floquet quasienergies .",
    "our numerical analysis suggests that , for every finite size @xmath11 , there are two - fold quasi - degeneracies of single - particle floquet quasienergies @xmath325 , ( i.e. , for every @xmath326 there is a @xmath327 such that @xmath328 ) which likely become strict degeneracies for @xmath15 , and which appear to be a possible source of a singularity in the spectral function @xmath329 , thus violating the hypothesis of the riemann - lebesgue lemma and giving rise to a persisting out - of - phase contribution .    summarizing , for a localized perturbation and in the long - time limit , the terms in @xmath330 which are diagonal in the floquet basis contribute only to the in - phase response .",

    "admittedly , a fermionic one - dimensional hubbard model is still integrable ( by bethe-_ansatz _ ) in equilibrium , but we believe that integrability is not a crucial issue in the present context : what we believe crucial ( see discussion in section [ energy : sec ] ) is that there is a maximum energy - per - site @xmath332 that the system can have , so that @xmath333 at all times , whereas lrt predicts , when @xmath334 , a steady increase of energy for large @xmath1 . in view of the energy considerations of section [ energy :",
    "sec ] , we believe that our results apply , both for extensive and local perturbations , whenever the energy - per - site spectrum is bounded ; this condition is verified for all the rigid lattice systems .",
    "a word of caution applies to systems ( for example a bosonic hubbard model ) that do not have a bound on the maximum energy - per - site .",

    "the linearity of the problem , indeed , makes lrt exact at all times , implying that the system will steadily increase its energy in time when the frequency @xmath47 of the driving falls inside the natural spectral range of the problem . at the linear level ,",
    "obviously , ehrenfest theorem guarantees that quantum and classical physics results coincide .",
    "when non - linearities are included , for instance adding cubic nearest - neighbor interactions , as in the fermi - pasta - ulam problem @xcite , interesting questions emerge concerning classical @xcite versus quantum non - equilibrium physics , and deviations from lrt .",
    "although we do not have a full picture of this problem , simulations we have conducted on the classical fermi - pasta - ulam chain with a localized periodic perturbation suggest that , when the non - linearity is strong enough , there are marked deviations from lrt but in such a way that the energy increases in time in a `` stronger - than - linear '' way , quite differently from the saturation effects previously described for quantum systems on a lattice .",
    "regarding classical versus quantum physics in the phenomena of interest , we stress that both the bounded energy - per - particle spectrum as well as the role of off - diagonal matrix elements with the accompanying dephasing , are intrinsically quantum ingredients : the effects described , therefore , might not survive in the classical regime . equally deserving further study are quantum problems on the continuum  where no single - band cut - off , typical of lattice problems , applies  , as well as the case of lattice systems in the presence of phononic modes . in the first case",
    "the answer is not obvious : for instance electrons moving in a continuum crystalline potential have a band energy spectrum without an upper bound ; though in some cases  @xcite quantum coherence effects still forbid energy absorption beyond a certain limit .",
    "we observe also that there is a similarity of our results with dynamical localisation @xcite ( quantum coherence and saturation ) , but in our case a thermodynamic limit is essential , while dynamical localisation generally applies to systems whose unperturbed spectrum is characterized by a discrete level spacing .",
    "finally , let us stress once more the striking difference between a driving which acts _ locally _ , where lrt appears to apply at all times , and a driving involving an extensive perturbation . evidently , no perturbation can be considered to be `` small '' at all times unless the system can act as a `` its own bath '' , which implies that the perturbation should not modify in any essential way the energy - per - site : if there is an infinite space in which the finite number of excitations generated by the driving in each period can propagate , the excitation energy per site will be always infinitesimal . on the contrary , when the perturbation is extensive , the energy pumped into the system , if no mechanism for dissipation is provided , will lead to a failure of lrt after a certain finite time : surprisingly enough there are quantities , like the in - phase response proportional to @xmath65 which are well described by lrt at all times .",
    "a non - trivial case might be constituted by systems with localized states , where the excitations generated by a local perturbation , due to the absence of diffusion implied by the localization , can not propagate away from the perturbed region : the local energy growth might then drive the system away from lrt .",
    "are the results we have discussed of any relevance to experiments ? obviously , no physical system is perfectly closed : coupling to an environment always leads to decoherence , take for instance the uncontrolled interactions with the electromagnetic field of cold atoms in optical lattices , or the coupling of electronic degrees of freedom in a solid to the phononic modes of the lattice .",
    "nevertheless the evolution can be considered unitary until correlations with the environment set up : this happens after a time scale which modern experimental techniques can resolve .",
    "for instance , in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices coherence times have been attained of @xmath336 ms  @xcite ; we think that taking a trapped systems of about @xmath337 atoms ( for which we can reasonably talk about a `` thermodynamic limit '' ) a periodic perturbation can be realised and in principle , with an appropriate choice of @xmath47 , a regime can be reached in which lrt is expected to hold and where the afore - discussed effects can be checked . in the solid state ,",
