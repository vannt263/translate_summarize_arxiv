    "the observations of type ia supernovae in 1998 @xcite found that the universe is experiencing an accelerating expansion . to explain the cosmic acceleration , an exotic energy with negative pressure which contributes approximately 70% of the energy density in the universe",

    "this exotic energy component is called dark energy . for a recent review of dark energy",
    ", please see refs . .",
    "we usually use a minimally coupled scalar field with positive kinetic energy term to model the quintessence @xcite , and a minimally coupled scalar field with negative kinetic energy term to model the phantom @xcite . for a scalar field with a nearly flat potential ,",

    "more general dark energy models can be derived from known models with @xmath1 , and the derived dark energy models can be approximated by the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the thawing scalar field models with nearly flat potentials with a starting value of @xmath0 that is close to , but not exactly equal to -1 at early times @xcite",
    ".    fundamental constants like the fine structure constant @xmath9 play important roles in physics .",
    "the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath10 with time produce shifts in the molecular spectra @xcite .",
    "so observations of molecular spectra in high redshift objects can track the value of the fundamental constant in the early universe .",
    "it is possible that the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath10 is caused by the non - minimally coupling between dark energy and the electromagnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the values of the fundamental constant throughout the history of the universe provide strong constraints on the property of dark energy @xcite .",
    "a lot of efforts have been made to measure the variation of the fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "these observations can be used to test cosmological model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the variations of the fundamental constants may caused by the interaction of the vacuum with the matter @xcite .",
