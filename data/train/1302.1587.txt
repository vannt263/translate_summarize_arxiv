    "the peak of global star formation occurred about 10 billion years ago at a redshift of @xmath9 ( reddy & steidel 2009 ) . the rise in star formation at earlier times is studied by tracing the space density and properties of higher redshift galaxies .",
    "such galaxies can be selected in the rest - frame ultraviolet as lyman break dropouts ( bouwens et al .",
    "2006 ) , in the rest - frame infrared as line or continuum sources ( carilli & walter 2013 ) , via black hole accretion activity as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) , or via stellar explosions such as gamma ray bursts ( tanvir et al .",
    "these methods are complementary in that they are sensitive to galaxies with a range of mass , star formation rate , dust formation rate and black hole accretion rate , to allow a broad view of early galaxy evolution .",
    "thanks to the high fraction of stellar radiation re - radiated in the infrared by interstellar dust and gas and the negative k - correction ( blain & longair 1993 ) , high redshift galaxies can be well studied by millimeter observations .",
    "continuum observations are sensitive to the star formation rate as radiation from young , hot stars is re - radiated by dust .",
    "molecular lines such as co probe the molecular gas in dense star - forming regions .",
    "atomic lines such as the fine - structure line of singly - ionized carbon , [ cii ] , probe the interstellar medium and the outer parts of star - forming regions .",
    "it has been recognized that the [ cii ]  line will likely become the most useful line for studying very high redshift galaxies with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ; walter & carilli 2008 ) .",
    "indeed early alma observations already show detections of [ cii ]  in normal star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 ( wagg et al .",
    "2012 ; carilli et al .",
    "[ cii ]  has also been detected in a few @xmath11 quasar host galaxies ( maiolino et al .",

    "one of most puzzling aspects of galaxy evolution is the tight correlation between black hole mass and galaxy properties such as bulge stellar mass and velocity dispersion ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "this correlation suggests a physical connection between black hole accretion on sub - parsec ( pc ) scales and galaxy - wide star formation and gas accretion on kiloparsec ( kpc ) scales .",
    "the most likely explanation is quasar feedback , but the details of how this operates as a function of cosmic time are still to be determined ( cattaneo et al .",
    "observationally , this topic can be studied by measuring the global growth rates of black holes and galaxies and the ratio of black hole to stellar mass in high redshift galaxies .",
    "the black hole masses of quasars can be measured from the dynamics of gas in the broad line region which is only @xmath12pc from the black hole ( wandel 1999 ) .",
    "as well as studying the physical properties of star - forming gas in high - redshift galaxies , millimeter interferometry can be used to probe the gas dynamics .",
    "a particularly useful application is that of quasar host galaxy dynamical masses to measure the ratio of black hole to galaxy mass in the early universe ( walter et al .",
    "observations in the rest - frame uv or optical are hampered by the overwhelming brightness of the quasar point - source ( e.g. mechtley et al .",
    "wang et al . ( 2010 ) showed that co line widths of the most optically luminous @xmath13 quasars indicate ratios of black hole to galaxy mass a factor of 10 on average greater than found in the local universe .",
    "this could signal that black holes grow much more rapidly than their host galaxies within the first billion years . however , there is a selection bias detailed in depth by lauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) which suggests that the most luminous quasars will be biased to high black hole mass due to scatter in the correlation . in order to check whether this bias affects the conclusions of wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) it is important to determine the black hole to galaxy mass relationship for the more common , lower luminosity quasars at @xmath14 such as those identified in the canada - france high - z quasar survey ( cfhqs ; willott et al .",
    "2010a ) .",
    "an alternative approach to studying the co - evolution of galaxies and black holes is to determine the star formation rate of active galaxies over cosmic time ( carilli et al .",

    "all the optically - selected quasars observed at mm wavelengths are growing their black holes at a relatively faster pace than their stellar mass and this is not too surprising given that they were selected by their quasar emission .",

    ", mm - selected galaxies mostly lie to the upper left of the line showing that they are growing their stellar mass more rapidly than their black holes ( alexander et al .",
    "lutz et al . ( 2010 ) also showed that low - luminosity agn from deep x - ray surveys are found on the left side of such a line .",

    "the simulations are designed to match the properties of the most luminous quasars from the sdss .",
    "j2329 - 0301 has a black hole accretion rate @xmath158 lower than typical sdss quasars and therefore scaling down the lowest simulated sfr by this amount would result in approximately the sfr limit observed for j2329 - 0301 .",
    "this suggests that j2329 - 0301 is observed at a rare phase where it has very low sfr compared to its black hole accretion rate . in the khandai et al .",

    "j2329 - 0301 appears to have very effectively shut off star formation .",
    "although the far - ir data of high luminosity pg quasars has many non - detections and the h - atlas data are just stacked averages ( figure [ fig : lbollfir ] ) , it would appear that few low redshift quasars have such a low ratio of sfr to black hole accretion as j2329 - 0301 .",
    "this quasar is known to be surrounded by a luminous ly@xmath63halo at least 15kpc across ( goto et al .",
    "2009 ; willott et al .",
    "2011 ) , which signifies a huge reservoir of diffuse gas likely photo - ionized by the quasar .",
    "when this gas cools and accretes on to the galaxy , a further bout of star formation is likely .",
    "hayes et al .",
    "( 2013 ) noted that the ly@xmath63  emission from galaxies with low dust content tends to be more extended than that in dusty galaxies , but do not provide a simple explanation for why this happens .",
    "j2329 - 0301 certainly fits this pattern with a low dust content as measured by thermal dust emission and a very extended ly@xmath63  halo .",
    "the [ cii ]  line detection in j0210 - 0456 is narrow ( fwhm = @xmath159kms@xmath5 ) and shows only a small velocity gradient ( @xmath160kms@xmath5 ) across a scale of 6kpc .",
    "the inclination angle of the [ cii ]  emission is unconstrained , but the narrow line suggests the dynamical mass of the system is much lower than would be found in the local universe for a galaxy hosting a @xmath161 black hole .",
    "this is in agreement with the results for more massive black holes at @xmath14 ( wang et al .",
    "2010 ) and fits with the discussion above that shows optically - selected @xmath14 quasars have experienced enhanced black hole accretion relative to their stellar mass accumulation .",
    "these early observations with alma are a prelude to increased resolution and sensitivity observations to come .",
    "a larger sample of @xmath14 quasars with a wide range of black hole masses is necessary to get a more complete picture of the relationship between black hole growth and star formation .",
