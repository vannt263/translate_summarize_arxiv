    "high transverse momentum particles resulting from hard scatterings between incident partons have become one of the most effective tools for probing the properties of the medium created in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "data from the four rhic experiments have unequivocally established the phenomenon of high transverse momentum hadron suppression in  compared to ( appropriately scaled ) collisions  @xcite , while the lack of similar suppression in  collisions @xcite provides strong evidence that the suppression is not due to modification of parton distributions in the incident nuclei .",
    "this suppression has been observed for a large variety of hadron species , at highest @xmath2 for  and most recently @xmath3 @xcite supporting further the notion that energy loss occurs at the parton level .",
    "conversely , direct photon measurements by the phenix collaboration show that the yield of hard photons in collisions is consistent with  expectations scaled by the number of incoherent nucleon - nucleon collisions @xcite and , thus , provide final confirmation that hard scattering processes occur at rates expected from point - like processes .",
    "this observation makes definitive the conclusion that the suppression of high-  hadron production in  collisions is a final - state effect .",
    "measurements of azimuthal angle correlations between hadron pairs resulting from fragmentation of hard - scattered partons into jets have provided additional confirmation of final - state medium effects on these partons @xcite .",
    "predictions of high-  suppression were made before the start of rhic operation @xcite and confirmation of these predictions may be considered one of the key successes of the rhic program so far . the suppression of high-  single hadrons was predicted to result from the energy loss of hard - scattered quarks and gluons in the hot and dense qcd medium created in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the canonical models ,",
    "medium - induced gluon bremsstrahlung is expected to dominate the energy loss process @xcite , and calculations of the high-  suppression factor incorporating this effect have been able to successfully describe the experimental measurements @xcite ; however , recent measurements of heavy quark suppression pose some questions to this canonical view .",
    "nonetheless , from comparisons of the energy loss calculations with the experimental data , estimates of the initial net color charge density which is usually expressed in terms of a gluon rapidity density , , have been obtained yielding @xmath4 and , assuming thermalization , estimates of the initial energy density have produced values in excess of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of this success , there are still a number of outstanding issues with the interpretation of the  high - single - hadron suppression .",
    "since the properties of the medium created in heavy ion collisions are not _ a priori _ known , the energy - loss calculations necessarily use the observed suppression to infer initial parton densities , usually through an intermediate parameter that appears in the energy loss calculations .",
    "although the initial parton density obtained by such `` tomographic '' studies has to be consistent with the final ( measured ) total particle multiplicity , it is fair to acknowledge that the  dependence of the suppression ( rather than its absolute magnitude ) is a more discriminating observable to test the various energy loss models . for  spectra",
    ", the suppression in central  collisions at @xmath0  gev is found to be approximately constant with  over the range , @xmath6  gev/@xmath7 .",
    "while the different energy loss calculations can reproduce this -independent suppression , the detailed explanation of the constancy is different in each model .",
    "the effects invoked to explain the  dependence of the observed  high-  suppression include : finite - energy effects , absorption of energy from the medium , evolution from incoherent ( bethe - heitler ) to coherent ( landau - pomeranchuk - migdal or lpm ) radiation with increasing parton energy @xcite , the -dependent mixture of quark and gluon contributions to the hard - scattered parton spectrum , the increasingly larger exponent of the underlying ( power - law ) parton  spectra  @xcite , and shadowing / emc effect  @xcite .",
    "while most calculations of the high-  suppression in  collisions account for shadowing / emc modifications of the nuclear parton distributions and for the relative mixture of quarks and gluons in the hard - scattered parton spectra , finite - energy corrections , absorption of energy from the medium , and the description of the energy loss process itself differs from calculation to calculation .",
    "clearly the central  single - particle spectra are not sufficient , by themselves , to validate or exclude any of the different energy loss models ; we must use more `` differential '' probes of medium - induced energy loss to better understand the phenomenon .",
    "a robust prediction of non - abelian parton energy loss calculations is that the average energy loss as a function of the in - medium path length @xmath8 shows a quadratic dependence @xmath9",
    "such a behavior predicted for a _ static _",
    "qcd medium , turns into an effective @xmath10-dependence in an expanding qgp  @xcite . in principle , the centrality dependence of the high-  suppression @xcite provides an effective test of energy - loss calculations because the length of the path of the partons in the medium will change between peripheral and central collisions .",
    "however , the energy loss calculations also have to account for changes in the initial properties of the medium with centrality and the extra flexibility in the description of the initial conditions means that the measured centrality dependence of the high - suppression also does not stringently constrain energy loss models @xcite .",
    "however , the path length of the parton in the medium can also be controlled by selecting high-  hadrons in different bins of azimuthal angle difference from the event - by - event determined reaction plane .",
    "indeed , shortly after experimental observations of azimuthal anisotropy were reported @xcite , arguments were made that the high-  anisotropy in non - central collisions was due to the spatial asymmetry of the medium and the resulting  dependence of parton path lengths @xcite .",
    "however , recent analyses have argued that the large azimuthal anisotropies at high  can not be accounted for by energy loss alone  at least when realistic nuclear geometry is used to describe the spatial asymmetry of the initial state @xcite .",
    "some of these analyses were based on a picture of the energy loss process in which quarks or gluons that have emitted radiation effectively disappear from the steeply falling high-  spectrum because they are overwhelmed by partons of lower energy that escape from the medium losing little or no energy . in this picture",
    ", the medium effectively attenuates the high-  quarks and gluons and the high-  spectrum is dominated by partons originating near the surface ",
    "i.e. partons originating in the `` corona '' @xcite .",
    "then , the azimuthal anisotropy could be largely determined by the shape of the surface @xcite .",
    "however , it has been separately argued that fluctuations in the number of emitted gluons may be large and such fluctuations may weaken the corona effect @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present measurements of  production in @xmath0  gev  collisions from the phenix experiment at rhic .",
    "these data , obtained during run-2 operation of rhic in 2002 , include additional data obtained with the phenix level-2 trigger which improved the total statistics by a factor of @xmath11 3 compared to the prior analysis in @xcite .",
    "the analyses presented here have also benefitted from advanced electromagnetic calorimeter calibrations and from improved understanding of the systematic errors in the  measurement in course of the direct photon analysis presented in @xcite , where the  decay photons provide the main source of background . with the improved statistics , the  reach of the data",
    "is extended to higher , allowing us to test whether the suppression starts to diminish above 10  gev/@xmath7 in .",
    "in addition , we extend the measurement of the centrality dependence of the suppression up to 8  gev/@xmath7 .    we present measurements of the dependence of the  yield as a function of the angle  of the  with respect to  the event reaction plane . by measuring the high-  hadron suppression as a function of , for a given centrality bin",
    ", we can keep the properties of the medium fixed and vary only the average geometry of the jet propagation in the medium . by comparing different centrality bins we can , in principle ,",
    "test how the initial properties of the medium affect the induced energy loss . traditionally , measurements of the  dependence of hadron yields have been analyzed in terms of the elliptic flow parameter , , and we note that the data presented here were used to obtain measurements of  for comparison to inclusive photon   @xcite .",
    "however , in this publication we focus not on , but explicitly on the suppression as a function of , expressed in terms of the -dependent nuclear modification factor . while the data presented this way",
    "contain , in principle , the same information as the combination of -averaged  and ,  provides a useful alternative way to evaluate the dependence of high-  suppression on geometry because it effectively combines  and  into a single set of data .",
    "we analyze the combined  and centrality dependence of the high-  suppression in the context of different path - length and density dependencies of the parton energy loss process to evaluate whether any geometric picture can simultaneously describe the centrality and  dependence of the observed high  deficit .",
    "the data presented in this paper were obtained during run-2 operation of the phenix experiment @xcite at the relativistic heavy ion collider facility at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite .",
    "the primary detectors used to obtain the presented results were the phenix central arm spectrometers , particularly the electromagnetic calorimeters @xcite , and the two beam - beam counters ( bbc s ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , the phenix zero - degree calorimeters @xcite were used for triggering and centrality determination .",
    "two - photon decays of neutral pions were measured in the phenix electromagnetic calorimeter , located at a radial distance of @xmath115.1  m from the beam - line , which has a pseudo - rapidity acceptance of @xmath12 and covers @xmath13 radians in azimuth .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter is divided into eight sectors , with each sector covering the full pseudo - rapidity range and @xmath14 in azimuth .",
    "the calorimeter consists of two distinct parts using different technologies .",
    "a lead - scintillator sandwich calorimeter ( pbsc ) with @xmath15 towers covers 3/4 ( 6 sectors ) of the central arm acceptance .",
    "a lead - glass erenkov calorimeter ( pbgl ) with @xmath16 towers covers the remaining 1/4 ( 2 sectors ) of the central arm acceptance .",
    "the corresponding @xmath17 acceptance of a single tower at @xmath18 is @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the pbsc and pbgl calorimeters , respectively .",
    "the event reaction plane in  collisions was measured in the two bbc s .",
    "each bbc consists of 64 hexagonal , quartz erenkov radiators closely packed around the beam pipe , in an approximately azimuthally symmetric configuration .",
    "the beam - beam counters , located 144  cm in each direction from the nominal center of the interaction diamond , are used to count charged particles produced in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath21 .",
    "the distribution of particles over the individual channels of the bbc s allows measurement of the azimuthal distribution , @xmath22 , of charged particles within this pseudo - rapidity acceptance .",
    "the bbc s also provide measurement of the collision vertex position along the interaction diamond with a resolution of 0.6  cm @xcite .",
    "the data presented here were obtained using the phenix minimum - bias level-1 trigger , based on the bbc s and the phenix zero - degree calorimeters , that selects @xmath23 of the total hadronic interaction cross - section of 6.9  b @xcite . for a subset of the data , events selected by the level-1 trigger",
    "were subjected to software level-2 trigger filtering after full assembly of events in the phenix event builder @xcite .",
    "a software algorithm performed a crude reconstruction of electromagnetic clusters by summing the pedestal - subtracted and gain - calibrated energies of `` tiles '' made of adjacent @xmath24 calorimeter towers groups .",
    "the tiles are allowed to overlap such that every possible such tile that can be constructed in each calorimeter is tested .",
    "one of the level-2 triggers ( `` lvl2a '' ) selected events in which at least one cluster ( tile ) had energy @xmath25  gev . another level-2 trigger ( `` lvl2b '' ) selected events in the 50 - 92% centrality range ( 50% most peripheral events ) with at least one cluster having energy @xmath26  gev .",
    "the measurements presented in this paper were obtained from 31.4  m minimum bias triggers and approximately 1.7  m level-2 trigger selected events . of the level-2 triggered events ,",
    "743 k events were selected by the higher energy lvl2a trigger and the remainder were selected by the peripheral , lower - energy lvl2b trigger .",
    "taking into account their rejection factors , the two triggers sampled the equivalent of 44.4  m ( lvl2a ) and 28.7  m ( lvl2b ) minimum - bias triggers , respectively .",
    "the difference is due to different online trigger pre - scale factors .",
    "thus , the combined event sample contains approximately a factor of 2.5 - 3 ( considering both triggers over all centralities ) more s above 6  gev/@xmath7 than previously published run-2  measurements @xcite .",
    "in the offline analysis , the timing difference measured between the two phenix bbc s is used to determine the position of the collision vertex along the beam axis and to select events with vertex position within 30  cm of the nominal center of the detector for subsequent analysis .",
    "the energies measured in the zero - degree calorimeters and the charged particle multiplicity measured in the bbc s are used to determine the collision centrality  @xcite . for the spectrum measurements presented here the total measured centrality range ( 0 - 92.2% )",
    "is subdivided into 9 bins : 0 - 10 , 10 - 20 , 20 - 30 , 30 - 40 , 40 - 50 , 60 - 70 , 70 - 80 , 80 - 92.2% . for the reaction plane",
    "dependent analysis , the most central and two most peripheral bins are excluded , the peripheral due to their large uncertainty in the reaction plane resolution , and the 0 - 10% bin simply because of its smaller intrinsic eccentricity .",
    "additionally , we present also combined 0 - 20% , 20 - 60% and 60 - 92% data sets for comparison with other phenix analyses of high  hadron production that use such centralities .",
