    "recent experimental work has shown that high harmonic generation of light can be seen from a solid material when it is hit by a large amplitude femtosecond light pulse  @xcite .",
    "the light generation comes from the photoexcitation and subsequent acceleration of electrons and holes in the material and the bloch oscillations that occur as the electrons and holes are accelerated towards the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "theoretical descriptions of this phenomena have been performed within boltzmann and semiclassical approaches and within a many - body formulation .",
    "the semiclassical approaches include the dipolar matrix element that couples different symmetry bands together to allow the field to photoexcite electrons and leave behind holes @xcite .",
    "the many - body formulation has primarily worked with a single band approach , and hence has not yet examined the photoexcitation process in detail @xcite . in this work , we examine a simple band model that has a gap due to a checkerboard ordering pattern of the underlying lattice potential and the corresponding charge - density - wave structure that results for the electronic band structure .",
    "because the resulting two bands have the same symmetry and originate from the same single band when the checkerboard potential vanishes , one can directly excite from the lower to the upper band with a formalism that uses just the peierls substitution to describe the nonlinear effects of the driving electric field ( the dipolar matrix element between these bands vanishes since they have the same symmetry ) .",
    "hence , this model is able to properly describe the whole process for high harmonic generation in the solid within a fully quantum model . furthermore , because it is effectively a noninteracting problem ,",
    "the full nonequilibrium dynamics , including all of these quantum - mechanical effects , can be solved exactly using an efficient parallel algorithm .",
    "high harmonic generation is an important subject within the optics community because the high harmonic pulses can be employed to generate sources of light .",
    "these light sources can then be used to selectively drive excitations in specific materials , allowing an experiment to focus on excitation by collective modes with frequencies in a narrow range of energy . in high harmonics generated from crystals ,",
    "the field amplitude of the high harmonics can become comparable to that of the fundamental , making it a possible source for light generation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the high order harmonics generated from solids are temporally localized to the center of the driving pulse @xcite , the high order harmonics can have short durations into the attosecond regime , allowing for ultrashort pulsed light generation .    in this paper , we first describe the formalism needed to solve the nonequilibrium problem exactly in sec .",
    "this includes both the formal solution for the green s functions in the presence of the field , and how to apply the green s functions to calculate physical observables . in sec .",
    "iii , we focus on two different scenarios .",
    "the first is the case of applying an ac driving field . in this case , one generates a current with the same period as the driving field , but as the amplitude is increased , the current develops significant oscillatory structure within the period , which gives rise to higher harmonic generation . performing a fourier transform of the current , we show that the higher harmonics develop additional oscillatory structure , similar to that of beats .",
    "next , we consider the case of a pulse driving the system . here",
    ", we find results that look very similar to those of single - band calculations , indicating that the details for how the photoexcitation takes place does not play a significant role in determining the structure of the high harmonic generation spectra except for an overall narrowing effect on the harmonic peaks .",
    "this is a particularly surprising result , since the simple landau - zener theory for tunneling shows that the ability to excite from the lower band to the upper band depends exponentially on the field amplitude , and hence one would expect the photoexcitation to take place primarily at the points where the field amplitude is maximal .",
    "but we find results similar to earlier calculations which did not take the photoexcitation process into account at all @xcite , indicating that the details of the photoexcitation do not play a significant role and instead primarily cause a narrowing effect on the peaks .",
    "this occurs even though the band has pauli blocking , in that once a state is occupied in the upper band no more electrons can go into that state .",
    "detailed calculations of the population excited into the upper band as a function of time show that the excitation occurs over an extended region of time , and that for large amplitude pulses , there are also de - excitation processes that reduce the number of electrons in the upper band and repopulate the lower band .",
    "these results are shown elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we end the paper by providing our conclusions in sec .",
    "we study a noninteracting charge - density - wave system on a lattice in the presence of a uniform time - dependent electric field .",
    "we work in a gauge that has a spatially uniform , but time dependent vector potential and no scalar potential , so that the system retains translational invariance throughout .",
    "the time - dependent electric field is described via the peierls substitution @xcite , which is a simplified semi - classical treatment of the electromagnetic field that is exact and nonperturbative . with the peierls substitution ,",

    "the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the creation / destruction operators for a spinless fermion at the @xmath10th lattice site and they satisfy the canonical fermionic anticommutation relations @xmath11 .",
    "note that because these electrons are noninteracting , the spin degree of freedom is trivial to include and hence is neglected here .    in a spatially uniform field",

    "normally , the green s functions are defined in terms of the creation and destruction operators in the heisenberg representation .",

    "unlike the retarded green s function , the lesser green s function does not simplify to depend only on the relative time evolution from @xmath38 to @xmath62 , but it also depends on the history of the time evolution .",

    "we take our starting time @xmath42 as a time well before the time we turn on the electric field .",
    "we assume the system is in equilibrium at @xmath42 and start the evolution from there . to determine the expectation values of the different momentum operators",
    ", we must convert those expectation values into the equilibrium distributions found from diagonalizing the equilibrium hamiltonian into its two respective bands .",

    "the sine pulse in figure  [ fig : hhg_sin ] with @xmath143 corresponds to a 7-cycle pulse and the cosine pulse in figure [ fig : hhg_cosine ] corresponds to a 9-cycle pulse .",

    "it appears that the 9-cycle pulse case produces more recognizable peaks than the 7-cycle pulse , as expected .",
    "but for @xmath110 , the 7-cycle pulse case produces a larger maximum hhg order .     and @xmath145.,width=336 ]    as we discussed above for ac driving fields ,",
    "having @xmath109 equal to the electric field driving frequency @xmath106 enhances the generation of higher order harmonics .",
    "the corresponding high harmonic generation for @xmath145 with the 9-cycle pulse is shown in figure [ fig : hhg_u=3 ] .",
    "it is quite complicated how the charge - density - wave gap @xmath109 affects the high harmonic generation , as can be seen from a comparison between the @xmath113 and @xmath145 cases . by selecting @xmath109 equal to the driving frequency of the pulse ,",
    "a larger maximum high harmonic generation order emerges , when compared to the @xmath113 case .",
    "the charge - density - wave gap @xmath109 also affects the additional structure in the lower harmonic peaks .",
    "for example , at @xmath146 , a clear splitting is seen in the center of each peak ( for the low orders ) in the @xmath113 case , but for the @xmath145 case , the peaks have not yet split .",
    "one of the main differences with respect to the ac fields is that in the case of a pulse , we no longer see an additional modulation of the harmonic amplitudes as we saw in the ac driving case .",
    "this is probably due to the smaller time range of the pulsed fields leading to broadened spectral features that prohibit destructive interference from occurring .",
    "nevertheless , we do see that for some field amplitudes , higher harmonics have a higher amplitude than the lower harmonics have .",
    "this behavior arises primarily from the fact that the higher harmonics are generated when the field amplitudes are the largest , and hence this effect has a tendency to emphasize the higher harmonics .",
    "note further , that even though one can not describe the photoexcitation process as occurring instantly at the point where the field amplitude is maximal , we do find that the results for the high harmonic generation spectra look remarkably similar to the results where one does not take into account the photoexcitation process @xcite ( except for more narrowing of the harmonic peaks in the charge density wave case and a smaller cutoff in the high harmonic generation for the same pulse amplitude ) .",
    "hence , it appears that details of the photoexcitation process do not play a significant role in the generation of high harmonics .",
    "the single most important characteristic is the amplitude of the pulsed field .",
    "the gap @xmath109 introduces small differences in the additional structure peak splitting and an enhancement of the high harmonic generation when the driving frequency is resonant with the gap size ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "in this work , we have developed an exact solution for the nonequilibrium problem of a charge - density - wave insulator placed in a large ac or pulsed electric field .",
    "the theory is completely self - contained including all effects of the photoexcitation of electron - hole pairs and of their subsequent acceleration in the large electric field , incorporating the nonlinear effects of the electric field within an exact formalism . in the case of driving by an ac field",
    ", we saw that the most interesting nonlinear effects occur when the electric field amplitude is large , and that a fourier transform of the temporal current traces display harmonics of the three important energy scales in the system , the driving frequency of the field , the gap of the charge density wave , and the energy gain due to the acceleration in the electric field over one lattice spacing .",
    "in addition , the regular , monochromatic nature of the ac driving field led to interesting beat - like structure for the strength of different harmonic peaks due to the possibility of destructive interference .",
    "we also examined the effects of the field on the density of states for the ac field .    in the pulsed - field case ,",
    "our main focus was on high harmonic generation . here",
    ", we found very similar behavior to that seen in single - band models that ignored the photoexcitation process .",
    "this includes how the strength of the peaks is fairly flat as a function of frequency until one hits a `` critical frequency '' where the peaks rapidly drop in strength .",
    "the size of the critical frequency increases with the magnitude of the pulse amplitude and is larger in the metal than in the insulator .",
    "in addition , as the amplitude is increased , we start to see complex structure develop within a single harmonic peak , starting for the lower harmonics . we also see circumstances where the peak magnitudes do not decay monotonically with increasing frequency , but there is a peak at some intermediate harmonic . because all of these features are seen in the single - band solutions , these results are strongly suggestive of the response having a universal character to it .",
    "the only significant difference that we see is that the peak widths tend to be more narrowed and the maximal high harmonics are reduced .",
    "an important question , that we are not able to answer in this work , is how to optimize a material for use as a pulsed light source .",
    "the main result we find with regards to optimization is that we want to have as small a brillouin zone as possible , so that we can reach the nonlinear excitation regime with the smallest possible field amplitude .",
    "this suggests that crystals with complex unit cells that include many atoms , may be better choices for high harmonic generation .",
    "but the gap in the insulating phase suppresses the high harmonic generation as well , so a balance needs to be struck in a real material .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that continuing experimental efforts will be able to see the universal features found in these calculations and will also be able to be controlled well enough that one can begin to develop devices that will utilize the high harmonic generation from solids in applications .",
