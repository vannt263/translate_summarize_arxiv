    "parton - hadron duality  or duality for short  is one of the central concepts in contemporary particle physics .",
    "it is invoked to connect quantities evaluated on the quark - gluon level to the ( observable ) world of hadrons .",
    "it is used all the time , more often than not without explicit reference to it .",
    "a striking example of the confidence the hep community has in the asymptotic validity of duality was provided by the discussion of the width @xmath2 .",
    "there was about a 2% difference in the predicted and measured decay width , which lead to lively debates on its significance vis - a - vis the _ experimental _ error .",
    "no concern was expressed about the fact that the @xmath3 width was calculated on the quark - gluon level , yet measured for hadrons .",
    "likewise the strong coupling @xmath4 is routinely extracted from the perturbatively computed hadronic @xmath3 width with a stated theoretical uncertainty of 0.003 with translates into a theoretical error in @xmath5 of about 0.1% .",
    "there are , however , several different versions and implementations of the concept of duality .",
    "the problem with invoking duality implicitly is that it is very often unclear which version is used . in @xmath0 physics  in particular when determining @xmath6 and @xmath7  the measurements have become so precise that theory can no longer hide behind experimental errors . to estimate theoretical uncertainties in a meaningful way one has to give clear meaning to the concept of duality ;",
    "only then can one analyze its limitations .    in response to the demands of @xmath0 physics",
    "a considerable literature has been created on duality over the last few years , which we want to summarize .",
    "we will emphasize and illustrate the underlying principles ; technical details can be found in the references we list .",
    "duality for processes involving time - like momenta was first addressed theoretically in the late 70 s in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we sketch here the argument of poggio , quinn and weinberg since it contains several of the relevant elements in a nutshell .",
    "the cross section for @xmath8 can be expressed through an operator product expansion ( ope ) of two hadronic currents .",
    "one might be tempted to think that by invoking qcd s asymptotic freedom one can compute @xmath9 for large c.m .",
    "energies @xmath10 in terms of quarks ( and gluons ) since it is shaped by short distance dynamics",
    ". however production thresholds like for charm induce singularities that vitiate such a straightforward computation .",
    "this complication can be handled in the following way .",
    "consider the correlator of two electromagnetic currents : @xmath11 where @xmath12 can be written in terms of a spectral function @xmath13 using an unsubtracted dispersion relation : @xmath14 it is well known that , to leading order in @xmath15 , @xmath13 is related to the total cross section for @xmath16 hadrons @xmath17 relying on qcd s asymptotic freedom one computes the correlator ( [ corr ] ) in terms of quarks and gluons for @xmath18 in the deep euclidean domain @xmath19 ; @xmath18 is chosen euclidean so that one avoids a proximity to singularities induced by hadronic thresholds like for charm production etc . from the spectral function @xmath20 calculated in the euclidean regime one can infer the cross section for physical , namely minkowskian values of @xmath18 .",
    "however , one can not obtain it as a point - for - point function of @xmath18 , only averaged  or ` smeared '  over an energy interval , which can be written symbolically as follows : ( s_euclid ) _",
    "s_0^s_0+s ds(e^+e^- hadrons ) this feature is immediately obvious : for the smooth @xmath18 dependence @xmath20 has to be compared to the measured cross section @xmath21 hadrons as a function of @xmath18 , which has pronounced structures , in particular close to thresholds for @xmath22- and @xmath23-production .",
    "this simple illustration already points to the salient elements and features of duality and its limitations :    * an ope description in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom for the observable under study is required .",
    "* this ope has to be constructed in the euclidean domain . *",
    "its results are analytically continued to the minkowskian domain with the help of a dispersion relation . *",
    "this extrapolation implies some loss of information ; i.e. in the notation given above @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the smearing which is an average using a smooth weigth function @xmath26 ; it generalizes the simplistic use of a fixed energy interval : @xmath27 * some contributions that are quite insignificant in the euclidean regime and therefore can not be captured through the ope can become relevant after the analytical continuation to the minkowskian domain , as explained later on .",
    "for that reason we have used the approximate rather than the equality sign in eq.([ansatz ] ) .",
    "* one can make few universal statements on the numerical validity of duality .",
    "how much and what kind of smearing is required depends on the specifics of the reaction under study .",
    "the last item needs expanding right away .",
    "the degree to which @xmath28 can be trusted as a theoretical description of the observable @xmath29 depends on the weight function , in particular its width .",
    "it can be broad compared to the structures that may appear in the hadronic spectral function , or it could be quite narrow , as an extreme case even @xmath30 . it has become popular to refer to the first and second scenarios as _ global _ and _ local _ duality , respectively .",
    "other authors use different names , and one can argue that this nomenclature is actually misleading . below",
    "we will describe these items in more detail without attempting to impose ex cathedra a uniform nomenclature ourselves .",
    "irrespective of names , a fundamental distinction concerning duality is often drawn between semileptonic and nonleptonic widths .",
    "since the former neccessarily involves smearing with a smooth weight function due to the integration over neutrino momenta , it is often argued that predictions for the former are fundamentally more trustworthy than for the latter .",
    "however , as we shall see , such a categorical distinction is overstated and artificial ; also it is not needed for the discussion in the following chapters . of much more relevance",
    "is the differentiation between distributions and fully integrated rates .    no real progress beyond the more qualitative arguments of refs . @xcite and @xcite occurred for many years . for",
    "as long as one has very limited control over nonperturbative effects , there is little meaningful that can be said about duality violations . yet",
    "this has changed for heavy flavour physics with the development of heavy quark expansions , since within this ope framework we can assess nonperturbative effects as well as duality violations .",
    "the remainder of this note will be organized as follows : in the next section we shall give a more precise definition of what is meant with `` parton hadron duality '' , which then allows us a discussion of possible violations of duality in section  [ sec : violation ] . based on this",
    "we give hints on how to check the concept of duality in section  [ sec : validty ] , before presenting conclusions .",
    "in order to discuss possible violations of duality we have to give first a more precise definition of this notion , which requires the introduction of some theoretical tools .",
    "we follow closely the arguments given in the extensive reviews of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the central ingredient into this definition is the method of the wilsonian _ operator product expansion _ ( ope ) frequently used in field theory to perform a separation of scales . in practical terms",
    "this means that we can write @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the following notation has been used : @xmath33 denotes a state that could be the vacuum  as for @xmath34 considered above  or a @xmath0 meson when describing semileptonic beauty decays .",
    "denote electromagnetic and weak current operators for the former and the latter processes , respectively ; for other decays like nonleptonic or radiative ones one employs different @xmath36 operators ; the @xmath37 are local operators of increasing dimension",
    ". the operator of lowest dimension yields the leading contribution . in @xmath38 annihilation",
    "it is the unit operator @xmath39 , for @xmath0 decays @xmath40 .",
    "they produce ( among other things ) the naive partonic results .",
    "yet the ope allows us to systematically improve the naive partonic result .",
    "the coefficients @xmath41 contain the contributions from short distance dynamics calculated perturbatively based on qcd s asymptotic freedom .",
    "following wilson s prescription a mass scale @xmath42 has been introduced to separate long and short distance dynamics ; both the coefficients and the matrix elements depend on it , their product of course not .",
    "the perturbative expansion takes the form @xmath43 and is performed in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "the expectation values for the local operators provide the gateways through which nonperturbative dynamics enters .",
    "the crucial point is that the ope result is obtained in the euclidean domain and has to be continued analytically into the minkowskian regime relating the ope result to observable hadronic quantities .",
    "as long as qcd is the theory of the strong interactions , it does not exhibit unphysical singularities in the complex @xmath44 plane , and the analytical continuation will not induce additional contributions . to conclude :",
    "_ duality between @xmath45 and @xmath28 arises due to the existence of an ope that is continued analytically_. it is just a restatement of qcd s basic tenet as the theory of the strong interactions that hadronic observables can be expressed in terms of quark - gluon degrees of freedom _ provided _ all possible sources of corrections to the simple parton picture are properly accounted for .",
    "it is thus misleading to refer to duality as an additional assumption .",
    "up to this point our discussion was quite generic . to specify it for semileptonic @xmath0 decays",
    "one chooses the current @xmath46 to be the weak charged current driven by @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "the expansion parameter for inclusive semileptonic decays is given by the energy release @xmath49 $ ] for @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "for the exclusive mode @xmath51 it is @xmath52 and @xmath53 with the latter yielding the numerically leading contributions .",
    "one of the main applications of the heavy quark expansion is the reliable extraction of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "one wants to be able to arrive at a meaningful estimate of the theoretical uncertainty in the values obtained .",
    "there are three obvious sources of theoretical errors :    1 .",
    "unknown terms of higher order in @xmath54 ; 2 .   unknown terms of higher order in @xmath55 ;",
    "3 .   uncertainties in the input parameters @xmath54 , @xmath56 and the expectation values .",
    "duality violations constitute uncertainties _ over and above _ these ; i.e. they represent contributions not accounted for due to    * truncating these expansions at finite order and * limitations in the algorithm employed .",
    "these two effects are not unrelated .",
    "the first one means that the ope in practice is insensitive to contributions of the type @xmath57 with @xmath58 denoting some hadronic scale ; the second one reflects the fact that under an analytic continuation the term @xmath57 , which is quite irrelevant for @xmath59  though not neccessarily for @xmath60 !",
    " turns into an oscillating rather than suppressed term sin@xmath61 .    of course we do not have ( yet ) a full theory for duality and its violations .",
    "yet we know that without an ope the question of duality is ill - posed .",
    "furthermore in the last few years we have moved beyond the stage , where we could merely point to folklore .",
    "this progress has come about for the following reasons :    * we have refined our understanding of the physical origins of duality violations as due to * * hadronic thresholds ; * * so - called ` distant cuts ' ; * * the suspect validity of @xmath53 expansions . *",
    "we understand the mathematical portals through which duality violations can enter , namely that the innocuous euclidean quantity @xmath57 transmogrifies itself into the much more virulent minkowskian quantity @xmath62 under analytical continuation . *",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is actually innocuous for beauty , yet not necessarily for charm quarks .",
    "the ` euclidean ' quantity @xmath64  the formfactor for @xmath65 at zero recoil  , which is given by an expansion in @xmath53 , could be vulnerable to such a duality violation",
    ". however , the heavy mass expansion for exclusive quantities such as @xmath64 is not directly given by an ope , thus this argument may not apply in this case . *",
    "we have come up with an increasing array of field - theoretical toy models , chief among them the  t hooft model , which is qcd in 1 + 1 dimensions in the limit of @xmath66 .",
    "it is solvable and thus allows an unequivocal comparison of the ope result with the exact solution .",
    "* for the analysis of @xmath47 transitions we also have the small - velocity expansion as a powerful tool .",
    "we will not go into any details here , since they can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the models do exhibit duality violations , but only highly suppressed ones conforming to general expectations .",
    "there had been claims of sizeable duality violations in the previous literature ; those have been analyzed carefully in ref.@xcite , where their flaws are pointed out explicitly .",
    "based on general expectations as well as on analyzing the models one finds that indeed duality violations are described by highly power suppressed ` oscillating ' terms of the form [ dv ] t(m_q ) ~ ( ) ^k sin(m_q ) for some integer power @xmath67 .",
    "more generally one can state :    * the primary criterion for addressing duality violation is the existence of an ope for the particular observable . * duality will not be exact at finite masses .",
    "it represents an approximation the accuracy of which will increase with the energy scales in a way that depends on the process in question .",
    "* limitations to duality can enter only in the form of an oscillating function of energy or @xmath56 ( or have to be exponentially suppressed ) .",
    "duality violations _ can not be blamed for a systematic excess or deficit in the decay rates .",
    "_ for example , no duality violation can convert @xmath56 into @xmath68 in the full width parametrically , only for discrete values of @xmath56 .",
    "* the ope equally applies to semileptonic as well as nonleptonic decay rates .",
    "likewise both widths are subject to duality violations .",
    "the difference here is quantitative rather than qualitative ; at finite heavy quark masses corrections are generally expected to be larger in the nonleptonic widths . in particular ,",
    "duality violations there can be boosted by the accidental nearby presence of a narrow hadronic resonance .",
    "similar effects could arise in semileptonic rates , but are expected to be highly suppressed there .",
    "* it is not necessary to have a proliferation of decay channels to reach the onset of duality , either approximate or asymptotic .",
    "instructive examples are provided by the so - called small - velocity kinematics in semileptonic decays and by nonleptonic rates in the t hooft model .",
    "putting everything together it has been estimated with considerable confidence  at least by the authors of ref.@xcite  that _ duality violations in the integrated semileptonic width of @xmath0 mesons can not exceed the fraction of a percent level .",
    "_ as such we do not envision it to ever become the limiting factor in extracting @xmath6 and @xmath7 since the uncertainties in the expression for the semileptonic width due to fixed higher order contributions will remain larger than this level . the oscillatory nature of duality violating contributions is a main ingredient in this conclusion .",
    "it also shows that duality violations could become quite sizeable if an only partially integrated width ",
    "let alone a distribution  is considered .",
    "generally , for distributions the expansion parameter is not the heavy mass , rather it is a quantity such as @xmath69 $ ] where @xmath70 is e.g. the rescaled charged lepton energy of a semileptonic decay . from equation ( [ dv ] ) one would expect that contributions the form @xmath71)/[m_q ( 1-x)]^k$ ] appear in differential distributions .",
    "if in the future we were to find a discrepancy between the measured and predicted values for , say , a cp asymmetry in @xmath0 decays , we had to check very diligently all ingredients upon which the prediction was based , in particular the values for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , before we could make a credible claim to have uncovered new physics .",
    "this means one needs a measure for potential duality violations that is not based purely on theoretical arguments .",
    "most theoretical uncertainties are systematical rather than statistical .",
    "as it is the case for experimental systematics the most convincing way to establish control over them is to determine the same quantity in independent ways and analyze their consistency .",
    "the heavy quark expansions lend themselves naturally to such an approach since it is their hallmark that they allow the description of numerous decay rates in terms of a handful of basic parameters , namely quark masses and hadronic expectation values .",
    "again the situation is very similar as for the perturbative series : once the coupling constant is determined ( e.g. @xmath74 ) from a measurement , one may use this as an input to all other perturbative calculations , thereby predicting other measurements .",
    "if a prediction obtained in this way fails , one would conclude that higher order effects have to be unusually large or that there is another deeper reason why a perturbative treatment does not apply .",
    "such independent determinations of the same quantity of course probe the overall theoretical control that we have established . by themselves",
    "they do not tell us whether a failure found is due to unusally large higher order contributions or to a breakdown in duality .",
    "the fact that both the inclusive and exclusive methods for extracting @xmath6 yield consistent values  and that the theoretical corrections one had to apply are both nontrivial and essential for the agreement ",
    "is such a test .",
    "we want to point to two other such tests that have become available , namely concerning the @xmath1 quark mass and its kinetic energy expectation value .",
    "the @xmath1 quark mass has been extracted from beauty production at threshold in @xmath38 annihilation by several authors @xcite .",
    "their findings can be stated in terms of two definitions of quark masses :    * the ` kinetic mass ' is defined by = - - + o ( _ s^2,_s ) , normalized at 1 gev ; it is well - defined in full qcd and does not suffer from a renormalon ambiguity ; equivalently one can use [ lambdadef ] | ( ) _ m_q . where @xmath75 is the mass of the @xmath76 ground state .",
    "* the pole or hqet mass which is a very popular choice , although it is not well - defined in full qcd since it suffers from the renormalon ambiguity .",
    "if appropriate care and caution are applied one can still use it in calculation ; as a rule of thumb one has for its relatioship to the kinetic mass : |_hqet = |(1 ) - 0.255 where the parameter @xmath77 is defined in the same way as in ( [ lambdadef ] ) : |^hqet _ m_q [ m(h_q ) - m_q^pole ]    the results are completely consistent within the stated uncertainties of 1 - 2 % and can be summarized as follows : m_b^kin(1)|_e^+e^-|bb = 4.57 0.06 |(1 ) = 0.71 0.06 [ mkinav ] or m_b^pole = 4.82 0.06 |^hqet = 0.45 0.06    the techniques employed in the analysis differ somewhat from author to author ; the full agreement in their findings is thus quite re - assuring .",
    "one should keep in mind , though , that these determinations share their experimental input to a large degree . the value stated in eq.([mkinav ] ) could thus be subject to some systematic shift from the true value .",
    "arguments based on the small - velocity sum rules indeed suggest that @xmath78 could lie a bit above 4.6 gev .",
    "the @xmath1 quark mass also affects the shape of lepton energy and hadronic mass spectra in semileptonic ( and photon spectra in radiative ) @xmath0 decays",
    ". its value can therefore be obtained from the measured lepton energy and hadronic mass moments , which encode the shape of these spectra .",
    "the delphi and cleo collaborations have presented data as shown in the figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "again it is pleasing to see that the different moments indeed yield completely consistent values although this is not truly surprising since they are highly correlated .",
    "delphi finds m_b^kin(1)|_mom & = & 4.59 0.08 0.01 + & & |(1 ) = 0.69 0.08 0.01 + m_b^pole|_mom & = & 4.88 0.10 0.02 + & & |^hqet = 0.40 0.10 0.02 it is again reassuring that their fit results are consistent with eq.([mkinav ] ) cleo measures truncated lepton energy moments and states their findings in terms of hqet parameters m_b^pole|_mom & = & 4.88 0.03 0.06 0.12 + & & |^hqet = 0.39 0.03 0.06 0.12    the main news here is how well the values for @xmath79 extracted from two sources agree that are quite different in their experimental as well as theoretical systematics , namely weak @xmath0 decays and the electromagnetic production of beauty at threshold .",
    "a similarly pleasing picture emerges from determining the kinetic expectation value .",
    "based on qcd sum rules and sv sum rules one had inferred for the infrared stable quantity @xmath80 : _",
    "^2(1 ) 0.45 0.1 ( ) ^2 . using the rule of thumb for the relation to the hqet parameter @xmath81 @xcite    - _ 1 _ ^2(1 ) - 0.18",
    "( ) ^2 this estimate translates into - _ 1 0.27 0.1 ( ) ^2 the aforementioned delphi and cleo analyses also yield values for this quantity , namely _",
    "^2(1 ) & = & 0.31 0.07 0.02 ( ) ^2 + - _ 1 & = & 0.15 0.07 0.03 ( ) ^2 + - _ 1 & = & 0.25 0.02 0.05 0.14 ( ) ^2    the fact that the parameters extracted in different way and form different observables yield consistent values for the quark mass and the kinetic energy parameter indicates that no anomalously large higher order corrections or unexpectedly sizeable duality violating contributions are present .",
    "from all what we know currently from purely theretical considerations duality violations should be safely below one percent in the semileptonic branching ratio .",
    "this is likely to remain in the noise level of theoretical uncertainties due to terms of order @xmath82 and higher and of higher order perturbative contributions .",
    "hence we do not see any need to assign some additional uncertainty to the extraction of @xmath83 from a possible duality violation in inclusive decays .",
    "this should not be seen as an ex cathedra statement . when more and more types of moments will be measured with more and more accuracy  even separately in the decays of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 mesons  , additional constraints will be placed on the same set of heavy quark parameters .",
    "this will provide highly nontrivial tests of our theoretical control .",
