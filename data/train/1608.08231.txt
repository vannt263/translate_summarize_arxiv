    "the study of the collective properties of systems composed by self - propelled individuals has been focus of intense research for the last two decades @xcite .",
    "the flocking behavior of a large group of animals is observed in many different species , such as birds , fish , bacteria and insects . among the theoretical studies ,",
    "the model proposed by vicsek @xcite is one of the simplest physical models of self - propelled interacting particles that is able to reproduce the collective behavior observed in real biological systems",
    ". the interaction rules of most flocking models are based on the standard vicsek model ( svm ) , in which particles tend to align their direction of motion with the average direction over its local neighborhood .",
    "that is , each particle interacts with a group of particles , that could be large or small , depending on the local density of particles and the specific rules of the model .",
    "the size of the interacting group plays an important role in the dynamics of decision making in human or animal populations @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that small groups of individuals can maximize the accuracy of decisions .    in this article",
    "we explore the simplest case scenario of pairwise interactions .",
    "we propose and study an alternative to the svm where , in a single iteration step , each particle tries to align its direction of motion with that of only one particle at a time , chosen at random within its interacting neighborhood , and in the presence of a small perturbation .",
    "if we take the example of a flock of birds , this model can be interpreted as each bird adopting the direction of one close - by bird , even if it is able to see a group of , lets say , @xmath6 birds around .",
    "this dynamics of velocity imitation is reminiscent of the voter model for opinion formation , if one interprets animals ( or particles ) as individuals ( or agents ) , and directions as opinions . in the original voter model ( vm )",
    "@xcite , each individual or voter is located at the site of square lattice , and can take one of two possible opinions .",
    "voters opinions evolve by an imitation mechanism , which consists on blindly adopting the opinion of a random nearest neighbor .",
    "the alignment with local opinions leads to the formation of same - opinions domains that slowly ( logarithmically ) growth in size @xcite , until one domain takes over the entire lattice and the system reaches consensus in a time that scales as @xmath7 in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "this ultimate state is frozen , as opinions can not longer evolve .",
    "the coarsening in the vm is driven by noise @xcite , unlike it happens in other ferromagnetic models where coarsening is curvature driven , like in the ising model .",
    "this particular macroscopic behavior of the vm can be understood in terms of its associated langevin equation for the magnetization field @xcite , whose ginzburg - landau potential is zero .",
    "the vm with an arbitrary number of opinion states has recently been studied in @xcite , where the authors found interesting properties on the evolution of the number of different opinions and the consensus times .",
    "some recent works have also applied social interactions to study flocking , like the majority rule dynamics explored in @xcite , where interactions are not pairwise as in our model but they include a large group of neighbors as in the vicsek model .    for its part , the svm can be thought as a non equilibrium ( ballistic ) version of the xy model , where particles move ballistically in the directions of their spins . in this respect ,",
    "one of the most interesting results of the svm is that , due to the motion of particles , it can sustain long range order in 2 dimensions for finite values of noise[17 ] , unlike the xy model which can not @xcite . as it is known that adding thermal bulk noise in the vm destroys global order in any dimension @xcite ( even when the noise is very weak ) , the study of a ballistic version of the vm could help us to better understand the ordering properties of collective motion , and its dependence on the type of interaction .",
    "we want to note as well that the flocking voter model ( fvm ) proposed here can be framed as a particular type of coevolving network model @xcite , in which the network of interactions evolve as particles enter an leave the interaction range of other particles .    in this article",
    "we show that the dynamics of the flocking voter model is very different from that of the vicsek model . on the one hand ,",
    "the fvm does not exhibit the order - disorder phase transition induced by noise found in the svm and its extensions . on the other hand , at zero noise ,",
    "the ordering dynamics is much slower than the one observed in the svm .",
    "also , the interplay between the interaction pattern and the alignment dynamics leads to a relaxation to the final ordered state that largely deviates from the one observed in mean - field , as well as in lattices with static particles . as a consequence , the mean convergence time to full nematic order ( consensus ) exhibits a non - monotonic dependence with the density of particles .",
    "the motion appears to accelerate the nematic consensus by a non - trivial mechanism that breaks the equivalence between particle states typically observed in the voter dynamics , introducing a net drift from minority to majority states .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model and its dynamics in section [ model ] .",
    "then , in section [ transition ] we study how noise affects order in the stationary state , and explore the ordering dynamics for the zero - noise case in section [ ordering ] .",
    "we analyze convergence times to the final state in section [ convergence ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and state the conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath8 particles that move on a continuous two - dimensional confined space of length @xmath9 , with periodic boundary conditions . at a given time @xmath10 , the position of particle @xmath11",
    "is denoted by @xmath12 , and its velocity by @xmath13 , with magnitude @xmath14 , for @xmath15 .",
    "that is , all particles move at the same speed @xmath16 but not necessarily in the same direction . at each time",
    "step of length @xmath17 , each particle @xmath11 selects a random neighboring particle @xmath18 inside a circular region of radius @xmath19 centered at @xmath20 , and updates its position and direction according to [ update ] @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the direction of a particle @xmath18 at time @xmath10 , and @xmath23 is a white noise uniformly distributed between @xmath24 $ ] , with @xmath25 the noise amplitude . in case particle",
    "@xmath11 has no neighbors inside the interaction range @xmath26 , then its direction is changed only by the noise . at @xmath27 ,",
    "positions of particles are assigned randomly , with a uniform distribution inside the box @xmath28 , while their directions are randomly chosen from the interval @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "then , each particle moves at a constant speed following a given straight path , and can update its direction at integer times @xmath30 , by turning into the direction of a random neighbor .    in the next section we study the stationary state of the system described by eqs .",
    "( [ update ] ) , and how it is influenced by the directional noise .",
    "voter - like interactions in the dynamics of the model tend to align the direction of neighboring particles .",
    "this leads to local _ nematic _ order in the short run , and to global or macroscopic nematic order in the long run , as it happens in flocking models with ferromagnetic interactions , like the standard vicsek model .",
    "the ordering properties in these systems are characterized by the parameter @xmath3 , defined as @xmath31 which is the absolute value of the normalized mean velocity of all particles .",
    "the order parameter @xmath3 can vary from @xmath32 ( total disorder ) to @xmath5 ( full order ) . in the svm ,",
    "noise in its various forms @xcite plays a fundamental role in the behavior of the system .",
    "it is known that the amplitude of noise @xmath0 induces an order - disorder phase transition , from a phase where a large fraction of particles move in a similar direction ( order ) for small @xmath0 , to a phase in which particles move in random directions ( disorder ) for large @xmath0 . in order to study this phenomenon in the fvm ,",

    "that is , in the absence of noise the system reaches full order , but a tiny amount of noise is enough to drive the system to complete disorder .",
    "this is related with the fact that any type of bulk noise in the voter model prevents global order @xcite .",
    "it seems that the imitation dynamics of the fvm makes the ordered state very unstable under the presence of noise , and the motion of particles is not enough to reestablish the order .",
    "this an important difference with the svm , where the motion is able to align a large fraction of particles and induce a transition to order .    in the next sections we focus on the zero - noise case , and investigate the dynamics and ordering properties of the model .",
    "we are interested in studying the dynamics of ordering in the noise - free case scenario @xmath1 where , as we showed above , full order is eventually achieved in the long run . in this final ordered state",

    "the two lower curves correspond to the fvm , while the two upper curves are for the svm .",
    "we observe that the approach to complete order ( @xmath55 ) is much slower in the fvm .",
    "this slow ordering in the fvm is characterized by an initial increase of @xmath40 as a power law in time , with exponent close to @xmath53 ( dashed line ) , and a final exponential approach to @xmath49 ( full order ) .",

    "[ s - t ] ) .",
    "we note that the decrease of @xmath59 is monotonic at all times .",
    "this is because some directions may not be copied by any particle in a single step ( mainly those directions followed by few particles ) , and thus these directions disappear from the system .",

    "therefore , we arrive to @xmath155 we observe in fig .",
    "[ tau](a ) that eq .",
    "( [ tau - n - rho ] ) represented by the lower dashed line gives a reasonable estimation of @xmath113 for low densities and speeds @xmath129 and @xmath156 .",
    "for large enough densities , the convergence turns to be faster than in mf .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of the number of different directions @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ s - t ] .",
    "there we can see that @xmath59 decays as in mf ( @xmath157 ) during an initial transient , but then it starts to decay faster ( exponentially ) , leading to a consensus time that is smaller than @xmath141 .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for large speeds [ see fig .",
    "[ s - t](b ) ] .",
    "as we explain bellow , the departure observed in @xmath59 from a power law to an exponential decay is caused by a dynamic reordering of the spatial pattern of interactions , from a well mixed system to structures localized in space . to explore this in more detail , we studied the time evolution of the mean number of neighbors @xmath158 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ k - t ] for @xmath69 ( the same as in fig .",
    "[ s - t ] ) , @xmath67 and various densities , where we observe that @xmath158 start to increase very slowly from its initial value @xmath159 corresponding to a uniform distribution of particles until it saturates for long times when the system reaches consensus .",
    "this increase in the number of neighbors suggests that particles aggregate into spatial clusters .",
    "indeed , when two particles are less than a distance @xmath19 apart , they can align their directions and then move together until one of them changes direction by interacting with a third particle .",
    "thus , one can see that alignment implies the  sticking \" of nearby particles , forming large sets of particles that move together in the same direction .",
    "these structures can be seen in fig .",
    "[ clus ] for a system of @xmath114 particles , with @xmath33 and @xmath160 .",
    "the panels represent snapshots of the system at different times , showing the transition from a uniform distribution of particles moving in random directions at @xmath27 ( a ) , to a spatial segregation into clusters of particles with the same direction at @xmath161 ( b ) and @xmath162 ( c ) , and to a quasi - consensus state at @xmath163 .",
    "the segregation occurs for higher densities as well , but clusters may overlap when densities are very high .     at zero noise ( @xmath1 ) , for @xmath69 , speed @xmath67 and densities @xmath66 ( circles ) , @xmath164 ( squares ) , @xmath34 ( diamonds ) and @xmath165 ( triangles).,width=283 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as we can see in fig .",
    "[ drift](b ) , the shape of the time derivative of @xmath166 agrees quite well with the shape of @xmath167 , showing a direct relationship between clustering and drift . also , @xmath168 reaches a maximum when @xmath59 starts to deviate from the mf curve ( see fig .",
    "[ drift](c ) ) , indicating that the drift accelerates the evolution towards consensus .",
    "( [ drift ] ) shows only the case of @xmath129 , but we found similar results for @xmath33 and @xmath67 as well .",
    "we speculate that the reason why larger clusters tend to increase their size more rapidly than smaller clusters is because particles that belong to larger clusters have , in average , a larger number of neighbors . and",
    ", it is known that in disordered topologies of interactions , like complex networks , the magnetization is not conserved in the voter dynamics .",
    "this means that nodes are more likely to copy the opinion state of other nodes with large degrees , breaking the equivalence between states . to check that this may break the symmetry of the fvm",
    ", we calculate the perason correlation coefficient between the mass of a given cluster and its mean degree @xmath166 , regardless whether the neighbors belong to the same or a different cluster .",
    "results are shown in table [ pearson ] , and were calculated by doing an average over @xmath169 realizations .",
    "the positive correlation between mass and degree shows that , indeed , large clusters have more neighbors , increasing their chances to gain more particles .",

    "we showed that the system reaches complete order at zero noise , and that the order parameter @xmath3 decays continuously with @xmath0 , presenting a power law decay @xmath171 for large enough @xmath0 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the system remains completely disordered when noise is present , even for very small amplitudes .",
    "therefore the fvm is not able to sustain long range order .",
    "this absence of order at finite noise is a phenomenon unseen in most related flocking models , but related to known results in the original ( static ) voter model .",
    "the zero - noise ordering dynamics is characterized by an algebraic increase with time on a first stage , and an exponential approach to the ordered state on a second stage .",
    "interestingly , a similar ordering behavior is found in the standard vicsek model , although the algebraic increase happens earlier , and thus the approach to order is much faster than in the fvm .",
    "ordering is related to the decreasing number of different directions of motion in the system , which is well explained by the mean field theory of the multi - state voter model .",
    "we found that the mean consensus time @xmath113 is non - monotonic with the density @xmath64 and , as a consequence , there is an optimal density for which the system reaches full order in the shortest time .",
    "the shape of the @xmath113 vs @xmath64 curve can be qualitatively explained in terms of two main mechanisms that act on different density scales . at very low densities ,",
    "interactions between particles are infrequent , and the dynamics is limited by the sporadic encounters between particles , leading to very large consensus times . at intermediate densities , the dynamics undergoes a breaking in the symmetry of transitions between directions , induced by the spatial segregation of particles into same - direction clusters .",
    "this symmetry breaking is enhanced by the motion of particles , generating a net mass drift from small to large clusters , and accelerating the approach to consensus respect to the mf behavior . at very high densities",
    "the mf case of all - to - all interactions is recovered .",
    "we have studied a voter - like dynamics acting on self - propelled agents subject to _ metric interactions _ , which by definition occur when two particles are less than a predefined cutoff distance apart .",
    "this type of interactions was adopted for its simplicity .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that some social living organisms , like birds or humans , may interact in a different way , for instance by considering the first @xmath79 closest neighbors , regardless of the distance to them @xcite .",
    "it would worthwhile to study a system with voter - like interactions in this context .",
    "in particular , the density dependence of the dynamics could turn out to be very different with respect to the one found in this article .",
    "finally , we believe that the simple power - law decay @xmath171 found for the order parameter vs noise calls for an explanation in terms of a simplified model . this is a topic for future investigation .",
