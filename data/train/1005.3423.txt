    "<S> this qubit is called topological because it is insensitive to local sources of decoherence ( since a single vortex can not tell whether its zero - energy state is filled or empty ) .    to measure the parity of @xmath12 , and hence read out the topological qubit , we make use of the suppression of macroscopic quantum tunneling by the aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling from @xmath6 to @xmath7 requires quantum phase slips . </S>",
    "<S> if the tunneling can proceed along two path ways , distinguished by a @xmath4 difference in the value of @xmath13 , then the difference between the two tunneling paths amounts to the circulation of a josephson vortex around the island containing the topological qubit ( dashed arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] ) .    according to the aharonov - casher ( ac ) </S>",
    "<S> effect , a vortex encircling a superconducting island picks up a phase increment @xmath14 determined by the total charge @xmath15 coupled capacitively to the superconductor @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath15 is an odd multiple of the electron charge @xmath16 , the two tunneling paths interfere destructively , so the tunnel splitting vanishes , while for an even multiple the interference is constructive and the tunnel splitting is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> a microwave measurement of the splitting of the flux qubit thus reads out the topological qubit .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite we assume that the ring is sufficiently small that the flux generated by the supercurrent can be neglected , so the enclosed flux @xmath20 equals the externally applied flux . </S>",
    "<S> junctions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are assumed to have the same critical current @xmath23 , while junction @xmath24 has critical current @xmath25 . because the phase differences across the three junctions @xmath18 sum to @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 the flux quantum ) , we may take @xmath28 and @xmath29 as independent variables . the charging energy @xmath30 of the islands ( with capacitance @xmath31 ) is assumed to be small compared to the josephson coupling energy @xmath32 , to ensure that the phases are good quantum variables . </S>",

    "<S> the minima are connected by two tunneling paths ( arrows ) , differing by an increment of @xmath38 in @xmath28 and @xmath39 in @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference amounts to the circulation of a josephson vortex around both islands @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the two interfering tunneling paths have the same amplitude , because of the left - right symmetry of the circuit . </S>",
    "<S> their phase difference is @xmath14 , with @xmath42 the total charge on islands and gate capacitors .    </S>",
    "<S> the interference produces an oscillatory tunnel splitting of the two levels @xmath43 of the flux qubit , @xmath44 tiwari and stroud @xcite have calculated @xmath45 for parameter values representative of experimentally realized flux qubits @xcite ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) . they conclude that the tunnel splitting should be readily observable by microwave absorption at temperatures in the @xmath48 range .    to read out the topological qubit one would first calibrate the charge @xmath49 on the two gate capacitors to zero , by maximizing the tunnel splitting in the absence of vortices in the islands . a vortex pair in island @xmath40 can bind a quasiparticle in the midgap state , allowing for a nonzero @xmath50 ( while @xmath51 remains zero without vortices in island @xmath41 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the topological qubit is encoded in a pair of majorana bound states ( white dots ) at the interface between a topologically trivial ( blue ) and a topologically nontrivial ( red ) section of an inas wire . </S>",
    "<S> the flux qubit is encoded in the clockwise or counterclockwise persistent current in the ring . </S>",
    "<S> gate electrodes ( grey ) can be used to move the majorana bound states along the wire . ]    to implement this read - out scheme the absence of low - energy excitations near the josephson junction is desirable in order to minimize decoherence of the josephson vortex as it passes along the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic edge states of a topological superconductor are a source of low - energy excitations that one would like to keep away from the junction . </S>",
    "<S> so for the flux qubit we would choose a conventional ( non - topological ) _ s_-wave superconductor such as al or nb .    </S>",

    "<S> the `` majorana wire '' </S>",
    "<S> @xcite seems particularly suitable : a single - mode semiconducting inas nanowire in a weak ( 0.1 t ) parallel magnetic field is driven into a chiral _ p_-wave superconducting state by the interplay of spin - orbit coupling , zeeman effect , and the proximity to an _ </S>",

    "<S> a pair of majorana bound states is formed at the end points of the wire , provided it is long compared to @xmath2 . for that reason nb ( @xmath52 ) is to be preferred over al as superconducting substrate .    </S>",
    "<S> a long inas wire running through a josephson junction circuit could conveniently form a register of topological qubits , as illustrated in fig.[fig_wire ] . </S>",
    "<S> gate electrodes ( grey ) deplete sections of the wire ( blue ) such that they enter a topologically trivial phase , producing a pair of majorana bound states ( white dots ) at the end points of the topologically nontrivial sections ( red ) . </S>",
    "<S> each pair encodes one topological qubit , which can be reversibly moved back and forth along the wire by adjusting , the gate voltage . </S>",

    "<S> once inside the circuit , the tunnel splitting of the flux qubit measures the state of the topological qubit .    for a universal quantum computation the flux qubit </S>",
    "<S> read - out discussed here should be combined with the ability to exchange adjacent majorana bound states , using two parallel registers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the topologically protected part of the computation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one needs to perform single - qubit rotations , which as a matter of principle lack topological protection @xcite . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> we show how the flux qubit can be used for parity protected single - qubit rotations ( by slowly increasing the flux through the ring from zero to a value close to @xmath54 and back to zero ) .    in comparison with existing read - out schemes @xcite , there are two key differences with the flux qubit read - out proposed here . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , unlike proposals based on the fusion of vortices , our scheme is nondestructive  meaning that the topological qubit remains available after the measurement ( necessary for the realization of a two - qubit cnot gate , see the appendix ) .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , our use of _ coreless _ vortices to perform the interferometry provides protection against subgap excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this parity protection is essential because the operating temperature would otherwise be restricted to unrealistically small values ( below @xmath55 for a typical abrikosov vortex @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic temperature scale for flux qubit read - out is larger by up to three orders of magnitude .    </S>",
