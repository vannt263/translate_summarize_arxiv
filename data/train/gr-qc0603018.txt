    "it is well known from observation that many spiral galaxies are endowed with coherent magnetic fields of @xmath0 ( micro gauss ) strength  @xcite , having approximately the same energy density as the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "for instance , the field strength of our galaxy is @xmath1 , similar to that detected in high redshift galaxies  @xcite and damped lyman alpha clouds  @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence for larger - scale magnetic fields of similar strength within clusters@xcite , which have been recently reviewed by giovannini@xcite and by carilli and taylor@xcite",
    ". these fields can play an important role in various astrophysical processes , such as the confinement of cosmic rays and the transfer of angular momentum away from protostellar clouds , which leads to collapse and formation of stars .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields at even larger scales has also been claimed@xcite .",
    "these fields influence the formation process of large - scale structure@xcite .",
    "recently@xcite the possible existence , strength and structure of magnetic fields in the intergalactic plane , within the local supercluster , has been scrutinized .",
    "the local supercluster is centered approximately at the virgo cluster .",
    "a statistically significant faraday screening acting on the radio - waves coming from the most distant sources has been found .",
    "this analysis supports the existence of a regular magnetic field of @xmath2 in the local supercluster .",
    "more recent discussions of possible observational consequences on cosmological magnetic fields that include the effects on the cmb anisotropy were made in@xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of the seed field .",
    "it has been suggested that a primordial field may be produced during the inflationary period if conformal invariance is broken@xcite . in string - inspired models ,",
    "the coupling between the electromagnetic field and the dilaton breaks conformal invariance and may produce the seed field@xcite .",
    "inflation has nowadays become a standard ingredient for the description of the early universe .",
    "in fact , it solves some of the problems of the standard big - bang scenario and also makes predictions about cmbr anisotropies which are being measured with higher and higher precision . the first model of inflation was proposed by starobinsky in 1979@xcite .",
    "a much simpler inflationary model with a clear motivation was developed by guth in the 80s@xcite .",
    "however , the universe after inflation in this scenario becomes very inhomogeneous .",
    "these problems were sorted out by linde in 1983 with the introduction of chaotic inflation@xcite .",
    "inflation offers the hope of furnishing a mechanism for kinematically and dynamically producing the seed of cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "it provides the kinematic means for producing long - wavelength effects in the very early universe by the amplification of short - wavelength modes of the inflaton field .",
    "this also could have happened with modes of an electromagnetic field .",
    "since an electromagnetic wave with @xmath3 has the appearance of static @xmath4 and @xmath5 fields , very long wavelength photons ( @xmath6 ) could lead to large - scale magnetic fields .    in this work",
    "we shall study a cosmological formalism for inflation from a 5d vacuum state , where the effective 4d matter , electromagnetic and vacuum effects are induced geometrically .",

    "this result can be interpreted as a classical large - scale electromagnetic potential generated when a de sitter inflationary process ends , which is responsible for a large - scale seed magnetic field .",
    "in this section we estimate the seed magnetic field induced from the electromagnetic potential whose dynamics was studied in the previous section . for this purpose we consider the 3d spatial components of @xmath139 ( @xmath140 are the 3d spatial basis vectors ) , which in view of ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq28 ] ) satisfy @xmath141 we consider the physical components of @xmath142 and @xmath143 measured in a comoving frame .",
    "hence , the orthonormal basis components associated with the observers in this frame are given by @xmath144 where the spatial part of ( [ eq25 ] ) has been rewritten as @xmath145 .    on the other hand , we know that from ( [ eq9 ] ) through the transformations ( [ eq23 ] ) we can obtain the standard maxwell s equations with sources , where such sources have a geometrical origin .",
    "the maxwell s equations without sources can be obtained from these ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , using @xmath146 and @xmath147 , equation ( [ smf1 ] ) becomes @xmath148 this expression describes the dynamics of the comoving components of the seed magnetic field . as in the case of @xmath33 , we can express these components as a fourier expansion @xmath149,\\ ] ] where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the creation and annihilation operators and @xmath152 are the 3-polarisation vectors which satisfy @xmath153 . therefore , the equation of motion for @xmath154 obtained from ( [ smf4 ] ) , acquires the form @xmath155g_{k_{r}}=0,\\ ] ] and has for solution @xmath156+l_{2}{\\cal h}_{\\nu}^{(2)}[w(t)],\\ ] ] where @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , @xmath160 are integration constants .",
    "the corresponding normalization condition for those seed magnetic modes is @xmath161 being @xmath162 the scale factor of the universe when inflation begins .",

    "we are choosing @xmath120 as a cut - off scale of the whole spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath168 on cosmological scales is @xmath169 considering the case @xmath170 , we see that @xmath171 , and thus @xmath172 , because @xmath173 .",
    "this case is of physical interest since it corresponds to a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum for @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , on the infrared ir sector , we obtain @xmath175 it is remarkable in this result that @xmath176 is a growing function of time during inflation .",
    "we notice that the typical infrared divergence appears when @xmath177 as in the case of the scalar field inflaton analysis for a de sitter expansion , where the spectrum is exactly scale invariant .",
    "on the other hand , the physical magnetic field @xmath178 is related with the comoving one as @xmath179 after inflation , @xmath178 decreases as @xmath180 .",
    "hence , we could make an estimation for the actual strength of the cosmological magnetic field @xmath181 @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes the comoving magnetic field at the end of inflation .    in the figure ( [ f1 ] ) we have plotted @xmath184 ( in gauss ) , with respect to @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "notice that @xmath185 is related to the spectral index @xmath187 by the expression : @xmath188 .",
    "furthermore , we have used @xmath189 taking @xmath190 and @xmath186 on the range @xmath191 to @xmath192 ( which corresponds to actual scales that run from @xmath193 to @xmath194 mpc . to estimate the scale factor evolution of @xmath184",
    ", we used @xmath195 which accounts for the actual size of the observable horizon ( @xmath196 ) and the size of the horizon at the end of inflation @xmath197 .",
    "in this letter we have developed a novel formalism of inflation which takes into account gravitoelectromagnetic effects from a 5d vacuum state , where the fifth ( spatial like ) coordinate is considered as noncompact .",
    "the reader can see a different approach in the framework of stm theory , for instance , in @xcite . in our case , to define the 5d vacuum on the riemann flat ( @xmath198 ) metric ( [ eq1 ] ) , we introduce the density lagrangian ( [ eq3 ] ) , which is purely kinetic , for a tensorial operator @xmath199 ( such that @xmath200 is antisymmetric and @xmath201 is symmetric ) where the vector potential has components @xmath202 , which are minimally coupled to gravity . working in the feynman gauge ,",
    "we obtain a 5d massless klein - gordon - like equation for @xmath203 , which represents the maxwell s equations in a 5d vacuum state ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) ) . using transformations ( [ eq23 ] ) with the foliation @xmath204",
    ", we obtain the maxwell s equations on an effective 4d de sitter background metric ( [ eq25 ] ) , where the sources ( the last terms in ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) ) describe the derivatives of the corresponding potentials with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the effective 4d dynamics of @xmath33 and the inflaton field @xmath35 is well described by equations ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) .",
    "finally , we have studied the evolution of the squared @xmath205-fluctuations during inflation , which are classical on cosmological scales .",
    "these fluctuations increase exponentially on cosmological scales and at the end of this epoch its strength is of the order of @xmath206 .",
    "later , we have estimated the present day strength of @xmath207 , which results of the order of @xmath208 .",
    "this results agree with the limits imposed by the high isotropy of the cmb photons , obtained from the cobe data@xcite .",
    "however , must be noted that our calculations are very sensitive with the number of e - folds that one consider during inflation .",
