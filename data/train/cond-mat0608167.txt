    "an intriguing orbital - current - carrying state in the square lattice , the staggered - flux ( sf ) phase@xcite ( also known as orbital antiferromagnet@xcite , @xmath4-density wave@xcite state , or charge flux phase ) which has the spatial period @xmath2 , has been the focus of consideration for a long time .",
    "this @xmath2 sf phase was first considered in excitonic insulators@xcite , then in high-@xmath5 superconductors@xcite .",
    "the absence of experimental vindications made it discarded in favor of other conventional orders .",
    "recently , it regains new attentions since unusual experimental findings in two systems : a hidden order in the heavy - fermion compound uru@xmath6si@xmath6@xcite ; a pseudogap phenomena ( see the review by timusk _",
    "et al._@xcite ) in the underdoped region of high-@xmath5 cuprates@xcite .    in parallel with the experimental contexts , numerical signatures in the @xmath0-@xmath7 model@xcite and evidences in two - leg ladder models",

    "it is also being discussed now in many new theoretical contexts : the double - exchange model@xcite of colossal - magnetoresistance manganites ; the repulsive su(@xmath13 ) hubbard model@xcite of ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices ; models with ring - exchange interactions@xcite .    for the triangular lattice case ,",
    "a @xmath3 sf phase with @xmath14-flux per plaquette has been considered as the mean - field ansatz@xcite for the heisenberg model .",
    "recently found layered sodium cobalt oxide system na@xmath15coo@xmath16@xmath17h@xmath16o@xcite makes it a reasonable reference state for a range of electron filling@xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the formal exploration of other possible staggered - flux phases has never been made in previous studies ( except a suggestion in studying the double - exchange model@xcite ) .",
    "we would address the following problems : can a class of extended - sf phases with generalized spatial periods , which are still macroscopically space - inversion and time - reversal invariant , be stabilized in a 2d lattice - electron model ?",
    "if so , how do these extended - sf phases compete with each other and with the fermi - liquid phase ? is this kind of stabilization a generic feature of 2d lattice - electron models ?    in this report , we try to answer the above questions through numerical studies of a class of extended - sf phases in the so - called @xmath0-@xmath1 model@xcite which is the simplest one being able to generate the @xmath2 sf phase spontaneously .",
    "this model has also been shown@xcite to be closely related to the large-@xmath13 su(@xmath13 ) @xmath0-@xmath7 model ( where the @xmath2 sf phase is first realized as a ground state@xcite ) and the weak - coupling hubbard model .",
    "if the idea about extended - sf phases can be realized in this simple model , then it should be further taken into account and be tested in the future studies of other more realistic models .",
    "for each extended - sf phase , we first investigate the variation of the total kinetic energy ( tke ) of tight - binding electrons ( electron - hopping part of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ) versus the flux parameter @xmath1 .",
    "further , including the `` magnetic '' energy of the flux itself , quantum phase transitions among these extended - sf phases and the fermi - liquid phase are discussed in details through quantum phase diagrams .",
    "the notation for an extended - sf phase is generally written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 represent the square lattice and the triangular one , respectively , and @xmath20 represents the spatial period ( _ i.e. _ , the size of a selected unit cell ) .",
    "sometimes a greek letter is added in the notation to distinguish among the extended - sf phases which have the same spatial period(_e.g . _",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 )",
    ". we will consider @xmath23 kinds of extended - sf phases in each lattice .",
    "the flux configurations of various extended - sf phases are illustrated in fig .",
    "these extended - sf phases are chosen by examining their symmetries and simplicities .",

    "( [ e.1 ] ) can be converted to @xmath47-space and then be directly diagonalized , leads to several subbands of the energy spectrum .",
    "the symmetries of the extended - sf phases in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ensure that the number of subbands are not too large . among these extended - sf phases , the energy spectra of three simpler ones , @xmath25@xcite , @xmath33 and @xmath21@xcite , have been clarified in details before .    after getting the energy spectrum ( numerically for large hamiltonian matrices )",
    ", the total density of states ( dos ) @xmath48 can be obtained by summing up the contributions from all subbands .",
    "thus the tke per site for electron - filling factor @xmath49 at zero temperature is given by @xmath50 and the chemical potential @xmath51 is determined through @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the lower limit of the energy spectrum .",
    "both the dos and tke are invariant under the transformations @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to consider @xmath56 for @xmath57 . for @xmath58 ( the fermi - liquid phase ) or @xmath59 ( also called the @xmath59-flux phase@xcite in the square lattice ) , all extended - sf phases in a 2d lattice are equivalent and hence have the same @xmath56 .",
    "then through the self - consistent determination of the flux parameter @xmath1 by minimizing the total energy per site determined by the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( tke plus the `` magnetic '' energy ) , we can plot the phase diagram in the @xmath49-@xmath60 parameter space by labelling the lowest - energy phase ( an extended - sf phase or the fermi - liquid phase ) in the @xmath49-@xmath60 parameter space .",
    "therefore for a given electron - filling factor @xmath49 , quantum phase transitions may occur when @xmath60 changes , and vice versa .",
    "in fig .  [ f.2 ]",
    "we plot the tke per site versus the flux parameter @xmath1 for several values of electron filling @xmath49 s . due to the particle - hole symmetry in the square lattice",

    "that is why @xmath25 can be stabilized before@xcite near half filling .",
    "while at @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ f.2](b ) ) and even smaller filling factors , @xmath25 has higher tke than all other extended - sf phases for a given @xmath1 . at @xmath65 , for @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , @xmath27 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 have the lowest tke , respectively .",
    "the nesting property of the fermi surface in the fermi - liquid phase at @xmath64 makes the system resemble a one - dimensional perierls system in which a lattice distortion lowers the tke of electrons by opening a gap near the fermi energy .",
    "therefore the advantage of extended - sf phases versus the fermi - liquid phase in tke can be considered as the generalized perierls orbital - antiferromagnetic instabilities@xcite of the fermi - liquid phase near the nesting filling , similar to the instability of lattice electrons in a uniform magnetic field@xcite . while away from the nesting filling , the advantage of extended - sf phases in tke is weakened gradually .",
    "as for @xmath71 , nearly all extended - sf phases have higher tke than the fermi - liquid phase .    -@xmath60 parameter space ( @xmath60 is in units of @xmath0 ) . ]",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath49-@xmath60 parameter space is shown in fig .  [ f.3 ] .",
    "we notice that @xmath29 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 occupy no space in the phase diagram . at @xmath72 ,",
    "the fermi - liquid phase is robust against all extended - sf phases considered .",
    "when @xmath49 increases , @xmath32 appears in the @xmath73 region . for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath26 , @xmath32 , @xmath27 and @xmath31",
    "compete and show several tricritical points . at @xmath76 ,",
    "only @xmath25 competes with the fermi - liquid phase near half filling .",
    "if more complicated extended - sf phases are taken into account , the phase space will be divided into smaller portions , however , the general features should not be altered fundamentally .",
    "the previous numerical studies@xcite suggest that the @xmath25 phase is a key ingredient of the ground state in the models of strongly correlated electrons , at least in the low doping regime ( doping @xmath77 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath78 ) , is in agreement with our results . and",
    "our results also suggest that when @xmath79 ( doping @xmath80 ) , the @xmath25 phase does not predominate ; when @xmath81 ( doping @xmath82 ) , stripe - like extended - sf phases , @xmath26 and @xmath32 should be taken as additional competitive ingredients of the ground state . of course , in order to give quantitative evaluation of the tke or the total free energy of interacting electrons , the hopping integral @xmath0 should be renormalized by many - body effects .",
    "it has been shown before that the instabilities of the fermi - liquid phase in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at nonzero @xmath83 can be related to those in the large-@xmath13 su(@xmath13 ) @xmath0-@xmath7 model at nonzero @xmath84@xcite .",
    "therefore the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] which shows different perierls orbital - antiferromagnetic instabilities at different electron fillings can be used to predict the existence of similar instabilities in the latter model .",
    "for the triangular lattice , the dos has the symmetry @xmath85@xcite , consequently , @xmath86 . around the nesting filling @xmath87",
    ", the extended - sf phases also exhibit the generic advantage in tke versus the fermi - liquid phase in broad @xmath49-@xmath1 parameter space ( see fig .",

    "[ f.5 ] , one should notice that the `` magnetic '' energy per site is @xmath90 in the triangular lattice ( in which the number of plaquettes doubles the number of sites ) .",
    "@xmath35 does not appear in the phase diagram .",
    "for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath33 dominates the phase space . for @xmath93 and @xmath49 close to the nesting filling @xmath87 , @xmath36 , @xmath38 and @xmath37 compete .",
    "when @xmath49 is far away from the nesting filling ( @xmath94 ) , the fermi - liquid phase is robust against all extended - sf phases considered . for larger @xmath60 ( @xmath95 ) , only @xmath21 is still robust against fermi - liquid around @xmath87 .",
    "it suggests that in parallel with the importance of @xmath25 near half - filling in the square lattice , @xmath21 should be a key ingredient of the ground state in some lattice - electron models@xcite in the triangular lattice near @xmath87 .",
    "in numerous works , the @xmath25 phase competes with other better - known phases , such as the phases of charge - density waves , spin - density waves , superconductivity , stripes and fermi liquid in the square lattice .",
    "the possibilities of other extended - sf phases in both the square lattice and the triangular one , and the competition among these extended - sf phases and the fermi - liquid phase , which have never been considered before , are the main contributions of this report .    in conclusion",
    ", there are several points to be addressed : ( a ) the generic and strong electron - filling - dependent stabilization of extended - sf phases in some parameter space of the simple @xmath0-@xmath1 model is an illustration of generalized perierls orbital - antiferromagnetic instabilities of the fermi - liquid phase in 2d lattices ; ( b ) in the square lattice , the @xmath25 phase is dominantly robust close to half filling , which agrees with previous studies ; ( c ) away from half filling , other extended - sf phases are possible as a result of advantage in tke against the fermi - liquid phase ; ( d ) in the triangular lattice , we find the @xmath21 phase is robust around the nesting filling @xmath87 ( in a manner similar to the @xmath25 phase in the square lattice ) , and other extended - sf phases are also possible when @xmath49 is away from @xmath96 ; ( e ) since lowering tke of electrons plays an decisive role in minimizing the total mean - field free energy in many cases , we keep cautious but optimistic hopes about applying our nontrivial new results based on a simple model to other more realistic systems such as the @xmath0-@xmath7 model and its large-@xmath13 limit , the hubbard or extended hubbard model and their weak - coupling limits or large-@xmath13 limits , the double - exchange model and models with ring - exchange interactions ."
