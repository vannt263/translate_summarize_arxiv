    "the recent discovery of topological insulators@xcite has spurred tremendous interest in the topological phases of condensed - matter systems .",

    "being rather insensitive to disorder , these edge states have promising applications in the fields of nanoelectronics and spintronics .    on the other hand , helical majorana modes",
    "have been predicted to exist as the edge state of tri topological superconductors.@xcite the current interest in the search for various majorana modes@xcite in condensed - matter systems mainly stems from their possible applications in fault - tolerant quantum computing . while some experimental signatures for majorana zero modes existing as the end states of effective 1d topological superconductors have already been found,@xcite conclusive evidence in particular of their non - abelian exchange properties is still actively sought for .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the charge transport between a system of 1d helical dirac fermions and a system of helical majorana modes , which are tunnel - coupled by one or several quantum point contacts . due to the coulomb interaction between the electrons ,",
    "the low - energy properties of the helical dirac fermions is described by the helical luttinger liquid theory@xcite and is possibly realized in the inas / gasb experimental setup by du s group@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the helical majorana modes can to a good approximation be treated as free majorana fermions .",
    "while strong interactions between the constituent electrons and holes@xcite may destabilize the majorana modes,@xcite the nearby superconductor screens moderate interactions effectively.@xcite as long as the majorana modes exist , they behave largely as chargeless particles and can be regarded as free .",
    "similar tunneling phenomena in heterostructures have been discussed using renormalization group ( rg ) analysis@xcite and scattering formalism@xcite in the case of noninteracting lead(s ) . in this paper , we calculate the tunneling current by using perturbation theory in the coupling between the majorana modes and the interacting helical lead , using the interacting helical lead green s function obtained by bosonization and the noninteracting majorana green s function as the unperturbed propagators .",
    "we use a scaling analysis to establish that the tunneling term is the most renormalization - group relevant local perturbation in our system .",
    "we consider a finite - size topological superconductor with discrete helical majorana energy levels and assume for simplicity that the level separation is larger than the tunneling rate . with this assumption ,",
    "we derive analytic results for the tunneling current through one or two quantum point contacts , and obtain the current - voltage relation by evaluating the analytic results numerically .    for a single quantum point contact with a noninteracting lead ,",
    "the tunneling current is the same ( up to an extra factor of two in the differential conductance due to two spins ) as for chiral majorana fermions.@xcite it shows periodic peak structures originating from the perfect andreev reflection in different majorana energy levels . with increasing repulsive interaction strengths , corresponding to a smaller luttinger parameter @xmath0",
    ", the differential conductance begins to decrease and eventually vanishes completely at the resonance positions .",
    "this effect may partly explain why perfect andreev reflection is difficult to observe even despite the existence of majorana zero modes in quantum wire experiments.@xcite the quantum critical behavior for the tunneling through a single point contact is similar to the charge transport with two helical luttinger leads connected by a quantum dot@xcite or the information leakage in the helical lead connected to a majorana mode.@xcite    as in a real experiment , the tunneling may not be perfectly local , we shall also consider the effect of extended point contacts@xcite using a model involving two point contacts .",
    "for two nearby quantum point contacts , the distance between the two contacts determines the interference structures in the tunneling current.@xcite for distances much smaller than the boundary length of the topological superconductor , the interference changes the shape of the individual peaks , giving features similar to fano resonances with the overall magnitude@xcite remaining periodic . when the separation distance is comparable with the boundary length we see the overall magnitude also experiences some modulations related to the separation scale .",
    "those interference features make the transport signature less universal and possibly modify the scaling behavior,@xcite constituting another reason why perfect transmission is hard to observe .",

    "<S> we show that the differential conductance decreases for stronger repulsive interactions and that the point contacts become insulating above a critical interaction strength . for a single point contact , the differential conductance as a function of bias voltage shows a series of peaks due to andreev reflection of electrons in the majorana modes . in the case of two point contacts , </S>",
