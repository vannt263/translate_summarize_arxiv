    "differential operators of infinite order naturally appear in many applications ( in a certain sense they constitute a total set of linear operators acting between spaces of differentiable functions @xcite ) . as usual ,",
    "such operators are constructed by means of finite order differential expressions substituted in the arguments of appropriate functions .",
    "if such a function admits power series expansion , the operator may be defined by imposing corresponding convergence conditions . in this article",
    "we consider differentiation with respect to a single complex variable @xmath15 and the operators constructed by means of the following differential expression @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are parameters .",
    "given entire functions @xmath18 , we set @xmath19 in order for the above series to converge to an entire function , we impose growth restrictions on the functions @xmath8 and @xmath20 by placing them into certain spaces of exponential type entire function .",
    "these spaces were introduced and studied in our recent work @xcite where we used them to describe the operators @xmath21 , @xmath5 .",
    "our present research is mainly based on the results of that paper .    in section 2 below we give definitions and a number of facts regarding the operators @xmath21 , @xmath5 .",
    "our main results are presented in section 3 in a sequence of theorems characterizing the properties of @xmath22 .",
    "theorem [ 2.1tm ] describes the operator @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , we prove that this operator obeys the decomposition rule @xmath23 which is then used to describe the operator @xmath24 with an arbitrary exponential type entire function @xmath8 ( theorem [ 2.2tm ] ) . a special role in our study",
    "is played by laguerre entire functions being the polynomials of a single complex variable possessing real nonpositive zeros only or the limits of sequences of such polynomials taken in the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of @xmath25 .",
    "it turns out that these functions are of exponential type and possess corresponding infinite - product representations .",
    "we prove ( theorem [ 2.3tm ] ) that if both @xmath8 and @xmath20 are laguerre entire functions and if @xmath26 , the @xmath27 is also a laguerre entire function .",
    "the above theorems extend the results of @xcite to nonzero values of @xmath28 .",
    "then we consider again the operator @xmath29 , @xmath30 , for which the decomposition ( [ dec ] ) implies that it preserves the set of laguerre entire functions _ for all real _ @xmath28 .",
    "further , ( [ dec ] ) is used to obtain ( theorem [ 2.5tm ] ) an integral representation of @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the latter result allows us to extend this operator to a wider class of functions .",
    "theorem [ 2.6tm ] gives additional information regarding the action of @xmath33 on the functions of the type of @xmath34 . in section 4",
    "we use the above results to describe the solutions to the cauchy problem @xmath35 ( theorem [ e1tm ] ) .",
    "it enables us to describe ( theorem [ lunatm ] ) the solutions also to the cauchy problem of the following type ( diffusion equation with a drift ) @xmath36 with the initial function @xmath37 belonging to the class of isotropic ( i.e. @xmath38-invariant ) analytic functions . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 stand for the @xmath41-dimensional laplacian and gradient respectively .",
    "all propositions are given without proofs since either they are taken from other sources or the proofs are evident .",
    "let @xmath42 stand for the set of all entire functions @xmath43 equipped with the topology @xmath44 of uniform convergence on compact subsets of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , @xmath45 is a frchet space . for @xmath46 ,",
    "we set @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 stands for the set of all nonnegative integers .",
    "every @xmath50 is a banach space . for @xmath11 ,",
    "let @xmath51 equipped with the topology @xmath52 defined by the family of norms @xmath53 , this set becomes a frchet space . to shorten our notation we write @xmath42 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 instead of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 respectively .",
    "[ 1df ] a family @xmath59 ( respectively @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) consists of the entire functions possessing the representation @xmath63 with @xmath64 ( respectively @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) .        it is worth to note that every @xmath20 being of the form ( [ 6 ] ) may be written @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an entire function of order less than one or equal to one and , in the latter case , of minimal type .",
    "consider the families @xmath75 obviously , @xmath76 and @xmath69 are dense respectively in the sets @xmath77 and @xmath78 equipped with the topologies induced on them by @xmath79 .",
    "however , the set @xmath76 is not dense in any space @xmath80 .",
    "thus , _ a priori _ it is not obvious whether or not the sets @xmath81 and @xmath69 are dense respectively in @xmath77 ( in its standard topology ) and in @xmath82 in the topology induced from @xmath83 .",
    "fortunately , this density property holds in both cases .",
    "the following two statements , which we borrow from @xcite , give information regarding the topological properties of @xmath84 and @xmath85 ."
