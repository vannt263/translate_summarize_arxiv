    "the study of the collective behavior of birds , animals , fishes , etc .",
    "has not only drawn the attention of biologists , but also of computer scientists and roboticists .",
    "thus several methods of cooperative control @xcite of multi - agent system have evolved , where a single robot is not sufficient to accomplish the given task , like navigation and foraging of unknown territory .",
    "these methods can broadly be categorized as the behavior based approach ( @xcite-@xcite ) , leader follower based approach @xcite-@xcite , virtual structure based approach @xcite-@xcite , artificial potential based navigation @xcite-@xcite , graph theoretic method @xcite-@xcite , formation shape control @xcite-@xcite . among other works carried out on single group of robots , cluster space control @xcite ,",
    "distance based formation @xcite , formation control of nonholonomic robots @xcite , kinematic control @xcite , and mobile robots subject to wheel slip @xcite , segregation of heterogeneous robots @xcite , are to name a few .",
    "+ the problem associated with the formation control of multi - agent system is that it becomes difficult to accurately position the robot within the group , as the number of robots increase . to address this issue shape control and region based shape control",
    "have been proposed , such that the robots form a desired shape during movement .",
    "the desired shape can be union or intersection of different geometric shapes .",
    "region based shape control has been extended to multiple groups of robots @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the robots can stay anywhere inside the specified region without colliding with each other .",
    "this means that the position of a robot inside a group can be specified and can further be controlled .",
    "therefore the position of a group of robots inside a larger group of robots can also be specified and controlled . moreover , when it comes to the control of multiple groups of robots , there should be at least one robot to convey the information of that group to another group .",
    "+ in an attempt to solve the aforementioned problem , a hierarchical multi level topology have been proposed , here in this paper , which is based on the centroid based transformations @xcite-@xcite for single group of robots . in this architecture",
    ", the large group of robots has been partitioned into relatively small basic units containing three robots .",
    "then the centroids of each unit are connected to form larger module containing more robots . extending the process",
    "gives a hierarchical architecture which is a composition of relatively smaller modules .",
    "as the construction of this topology involves connecting the centroid , it is named centroid based topology ( cbt ) .",
    "the cbts basically capture the constraint relationship among the robots .",
    "another advantage of cbt is that it separates shape variables from the centroid and thus separates the formation shape controller and tracking controller design . as the centroid moves",
    ", the entire structure moves maintaining the shape specified by the shape variables . in @xcite , different cbts for multiple groups of robots",
    "have been introduced , to get a modular architecture distinguishable in the form of * intra group shape variables * , * inter group shape variables * along with centroid .",
    "it is to be noted that a centroid based decoupling approach is adopted in @xcite to improve the convergence rate of cyclic pursuit scheme for vehicle networks .",
    "however , the modularity presented in this paper allows one to distinguish even the intra group shape variables of different groups .",
    "thus multi time scale convergence behaviour of singular perturbation approach can be utilized in this modular framework so that convergence times of different groups can be selected based on the choice of the user .",
    "based on this modular structure , a novel feedback control algorithm is proposed here in this paper .",
    "the gains of the feedback controller are so selected that the closed loop dynamics becomes singularly perturbed system .",
    "thus the model of the system reduces to the dynamics of centroid after the convergence of intra and inter group shape dynamics .",
    "this technique allows us to give importance to the part of the formation dynamics , which has to converge earlier than the others , based on the choice of the gains of the respective controller .",
    "potential function based controller has also been designed to avoid inter robot collision .",

    "<S> different geometric patterns and shapes are generated using groups of agents , and this needs formation control . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> centroid based transformation ( cbt ) , has been applied to decompose the combined dynamics of nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots ( wmrs ) into three subsystems : intra and inter group shape dynamics , and the dynamics of the centroid . </S>",
    "<S> the intra group shape dynamics can further be partitioned into the shape dynamics of each group , giving the notion of multiple group . thus separate controllers have been designed for each subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> the gains of the controllers are such chosen that the overall system becomes singularly perturbed system , and different subsystems converge to their desired values at different times . then multi - time scale convergence analysis has been carried out in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> negative gradient of a potential based function has been added to the controller to ensure collision avoidance among the robots . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller . </S>"
