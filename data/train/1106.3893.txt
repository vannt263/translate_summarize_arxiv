    "stochastic force in the dynamical description of a physical system is usually assumed as a white , gaussian noise",
    ". that approximation may be sufficient if the correlation time is short , compared to the time - scale of the system .",
    "however , correlations of the stochastic force are important in many physical problems",
    ". slowly decaying correlations are present in various phenomena including chemical reactions in solutions @xcite , ligand migration in biomolecules @xcite , atomic diffusion through a periodic lattice @xcite , spectroscopy @xcite and hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "long - time memory may also occur in climate , physiology , financial markets and earthquake research @xcite .",
    "the paper ref.@xcite reported that the normalised prices of both babylonian and english agricultural commodities exhibited persistent correlations of a power - law type over long periods of up to several centuries .",
    "moreover , long - time correlations emerge in effective , low - dimensional stochastic descriptions of complicated deterministic systems ; they are produced by the procedure of fast degrees of freedom removal @xcite .",
    "long correlations of the velocity are often connected with the anomalous diffusion : the position variance rises either slower or faster than linearly with time .",
    "examples of anomalous diffusion are frequently encountered in disordered media @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated recently that the subdiffusive motion of a polymer is related to scaling of the monomer mean square displacement and the velocity autocorrelation function is algebraic @xcite .",
    "the importance of strong memory ( long autocorrelations )  as well as long tails of the distribution in fluctuations of company profit was stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite : simple , uncorrelated models are a poor approximation to real market phenomena .",
    "systems with finite correlation time of the stochastic force may be described by the integro - differential langevin equation .",
    "if the memory kernel has the same form as the force autocorrelation function , fluctuation - dissipation relations are satisfied @xcite .",
    "anomalous transport can be described by jumping processes . continuous time random walk theory ( ctrw ) @xcite , in particular , predicts subdiffusion which results from the non - poissonian form of the waiting - time distribution and makes the process non - markovian . that property is mathematically expressed as a fractional time - derivative in the fokker - planck equation .",
    "anomalous diffusion , both super- and subdiffusion , is predicted by a markovian version of ctrw if one allows for a variable jumping rate @xcite .",
    "besides the waiting - time distribution , ctrw involves the jumping - size distribution . due to the central limit theorem ,",
    "stable distributions are distinguished .",
    "they can have either the form of a gaussian or a general stable lvy distribution , which is characterised by long tails @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the stability index ( lvy flights ) @xcite .",
    "then , the fokker - planck equation contains the fractional derivative in respect to the process variable .",
    "the above asymptotics implies that variance , as well as all higher moments , must be divergent for any time ( the accelerated diffusion ) .",
    "this property means that infinite jumps are performed during a finite time ; for that reason lvy flights are unphysical in dynamical problems .",
    "the difficulty can be avoided if one introduces the lvy walk for which the jump size is strictly related to the time interval @xcite .",
    "those systems can exhibit anomalous diffusion .",
    "this is the case for the transport of two - level atoms in optical molasses derived from counterpropagating laser beams @xcite .",
    "the atom which stays for a long time in the potential well may accumulate enough energy , due to spontaneous emissions , to jump above the barrier and perform a long flight . if the depth of the optical potential is small enough , both the momentum autocorrelation function and the position variance obey the power - law dependence ; diffusion may be anomalous .",
    "one can expect that for the gaussian processes the system is close to the thermal equilibrium ; the detailed balance is then satisfied .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated that ctrw with a constant driving force satisfies the einstein relation for an arbitrary memory kernel @xcite .",
    "a jumping process , which is well suited to modelling long - time correlations , is called the kangaroo process ( kp ) @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the poissonian waiting - time distribution with a variable rate . instead of the jump - size distribution",
    ", kp assumes the distribution of the process value just after the jump . as a result",
    ", it can not be described by a differential  either second order or fractional  fokker - planck equation , and then it is well suited as a model of non - diffusive processes with strong collisions .",
    "kp is a natural formalism to handle the fully developed boundary - layer turbulence since a local description is inadequate in this case @xcite ; the velocity profile for the newtonian shear flow is governed by the integro - differential equation of kp . moreover ,",
    "a stochastic description of the hyperfine structure of spectral lines is possible by kp since correlations of the radiation emission / absorption operator can be easily taken into account @xcite . for the same reason , kp was applied to describe the stochastic stark broadening , which involves correlations @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it can also serve as a model of coloured noises in dynamical problems @xcite .",
    "considerations involving the correlation problem require some care for the case @xmath3 since the covariance function is infinite .",
    "one can introduce a simple modification of the process by cutting the distribution at some large value .",
    "such a truncation procedure is realistic since all physical systems are finite .",
    "for example , truncation of the velocity distribution emerges in the natural way in optical molasses since the doppler force becomes large at high momentum @xcite .",
    "processes with truncated distributions have finite ( co@xmath4)variance , besides that their properties do not differ from those for the stable distributions @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that diffusion  in the presence of the lvy flights  qualitatively depends on both the correlation form and specific choice of the noise .",
    "we consider two models of the particle velocity : a jumping process ( kp ) and the ornstein - uhlenbeck - lvy ( oul ) process . the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii kp",

    "the probability density of @xmath12 becomes @xmath5 and the process value remains constant until the next jump .",
    "the process is stationary and markovian , and it can be described by the infinitesimal transition probability @xmath13 : @xmath14    \\delta(\\xi'-\\xi)+\\nu(\\xi ' ) \\delta t q(\\xi).\\ ] ] since the time interval @xmath15 is small , only one jump is taken into account in the above expression .",
    "the first term in eq.([trkp ] ) corresponds to the event that no jump occurred . from eq.([trkp ] ) , the master equation directly follows : @xmath16 the stationary solution of eq.([fpkp ] ) is given by @xmath17 where the frequency @xmath9 is averaged over @xmath18 .",
    "existence of the integral in eq.([psta ] ) imposes appropriate requirements on the functions @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",

    "the process is characterised by a broad spectrum of possible covariance functions .",
    "we define that quantity in the stationary limit by a joint probability @xmath23 as @xmath24 where we assume that all the above quantities exist and are finite .",
    "@xmath25 can be evaluated by summing up over all possible sequences of jumps @xcite .",
    "if both @xmath18 and @xmath9 are even functions , eq.([dcov ] ) takes a simple form @xmath26 the integral in eq.([corin ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath27 which is essentially a laplace transform .",
    "we want to construct the jumping process for a given covariance by an appriopriate choice of the ( even ) function @xmath9 .",
    "this can be achieved by inverting the laplace transform from @xmath25 ; then @xmath9 follows from a simple differential equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the inverse laplace transform of @xmath25 .",

    "<S> both the exponential and the algebraic form of the covariance  defined for the truncated distribution  are considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated by numerical calculations that the stationary solution of the master equation for the case of power - law correlations decays with time , but a simple modification of the process makes the tails stable . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of the paper is a finding that  in contrast to the velocity fluctuations  the position variance may be finite . </S>",
    "<S> it rises with time faster than linearly : the diffusion is anomalously enhanced . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a process which follows from a superposition of the ornstein - uhlenbeck - lvy processes always leads to position distributions with a divergent variance which means accelerated diffusion .    </S>",
