    "dilute gases of alkali atoms provide a unique setting in which to study the properties of quantum fluids .",
    "the tremendous precision with which they can be controlled and probed makes them an ideal model system for understanding physical phenomena important to other less easily studied systems with similar physical properties . because alkali atoms possess internal spin degrees of freedom , alkali becs are described by a multi - component order parameter .",
    "this vectorial nature of the order parameter allows for much more complex structure and dynamics than occur in a single component bec , with important ramifications for the system s physical properties .",
    "the work contained in this article was motivated by an interest in creating and studying topological excitations of the spinor bec such as coreless vortices @xcite .",
    "spin textures such as coreless vortices @xcite and skyrmions @xcite are important features of quantum many - body systems such as liquid helium @xcite , superconductors @xcite , and neutron stars @xcite , and they also possess important symmetry properties deeply connected to fundamental principles of physics @xcite .",
    "there have been several previous approaches to creating nontrivial spin textures in alkali becs . using a method referred to as ` phase imprinting ' , the first vortex observed in an alkali bec was created by coupling hyperfine ground states using a combination of laser , radio - frequency , and microwave fields @xcite . while this was quite effective , the interaction time required to generate the desired state was on the order of tens of milliseconds . in another approach ,",
    "raman transitions using eit - based stopped light techniques @xcite were used to generate solitons and vortices .",
    "both this approach and the phase imprinting experiments involve population transfer between different hyperfine ( ground ) spin states , which are typically separated by several ghz .",
    "this large energy splitting essentially freezes out spin dynamics . in a elegant and very different series of experiments , adiabatic ramping of an inhomogeneous magnetic field",
    "was shown to create spin textures within a single zeeman manifold @xcite .",
    "however , the spatial complexity of the spin textures that can be created using purely magnetic techniques is restricted by practical constraints on creating complex field geometries and by conservation of angular momentum within the essentially closed system .    in this work",
    "we explore the interaction of raman - detuned laser fields with an alkali bec , with the purpose of developing general all - optical techniques for controlling the multi - component order parameter @xcite .",
    "we choose an all optical approach because state manipulation can be readily realized on a microsecond time scale , and we focus on spin states within a single hyperfine manifold because this provides full access to spin mixing dynamics @xcite .",
    "because of the true multilevel nature of the alkali atoms , the atom - field interaction exhibits a remarkable degree of complexity which , as we will show , must be taken into account .",
    "an interest in multilevel raman transitions of this type is not new . in earlier work , for example",
    ", the coupling between three separate electronic states with zeeman substructure has been studied @xcite .",
    "further , a number of elegant experiments showing coherent control and creation of superpositions of zeeman sublevels has been conducted with atomic beams of metastable neon @xcite .",
    "we also note that the idea of using a stimulated raman process to couple multiple ground - state zeeman sublevels was previously explored theoretically @xcite and that adiabatic passage between ground state sublevels of a cesium atomic beam has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , our results here represent the first detailed treatment of raman coupling between sublevels of the same ground - state zeeman manifold in a way that takes into account both the excited state and the ground state level structure .",
    "one of the more interesting and useful features of the raman coupling interaction investigated here is that the applied laser fields induce state - dependent light shifts which depend in a non - trivial way on the laser beam parameters and the atomic level structure @xcite .",
    "this inherent richness in the interaction provides a convenient degree of flexibility in controlling the condensate , allowing the creation of a variety of states not accessible in previous experiments . in section [ sec : modeling ]",
    "we outline the construction of a model of the system , subject to certain constraints which are of particular importance in modeling spatially inhomogeneous interactions @xcite .",
    "although the results presented here can be easily extended to other alkali atoms , we will focus on implementation in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 ground state sublevels of @xmath0rb , which has a number of features that recommend it as a good choice for investigating bec spinor physics .    in section [ sec : results ] we show the experimental results of several tests of the validity of the model in @xmath0rb as put forward in section [ sec : modeling ] .",
    "these tests include demonstrations of amplitude and phase control of the components of the order parameter via pair - wise coupling , as well as a demonstration of the possibilities for simultaneous three - state coupling in the @xmath2 manifold .",
    "the application of these results to the broader problem of preparing specific spin textures with spatially - varying amplitudes and phases will be briefly discussed in the conclusion .",
    "the @xmath4 ground electronic state in alkali atoms is composed of two hyperfine manifolds of total spin @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the nuclear spin . these manifolds consist of @xmath7 sublevels , which in the absence of a magnetic field are degenerate .",
    "these states are connected to the @xmath8 electronic states by the d@xmath3 transitions , which in the case of rb involves photons of @xmath9 nm . the land factors of the ground and excited electronic states differ ; in the presence of a small magnetic field the transitions between individual sublevels are no longer degenerate . in constructing an appropriate model of our experimental configuration , we consider the presence of a small applied magnetic bias field of up to a few tens of gauss . because the two - photon linewidth of the raman coupling can easily be smaller than the nonlinear part of the zeeman shift ( see section [ ssec:2pdet ] )",
    ", it is necessary to use the breit - rabi formula to calculate the magnitude of the energy shifts due to the applied magnetic fields .",
    "this has especially important consequences when linking three or more states in the same zeeman manifold .    in both our modeling and our experiments",
    "we work in the low - density limit , which has two important consequences .",
    "first , the nonlinear interaction terms due to the mean - field energy are small enough to be neglected in comparison to the raman coupling terms .",
    "second , in a sufficiently low - density atomic cloud , beam propagation effects can be safely neglected .",
    "we also adopt a pure state description of the system , which is valid as long as the spontaneous scattering rate is negligible .",
    "this can be accomplished either by detuning the optical fields sufficiently far from resonance , or by using laser pulse configurations which maintain the system in an adiabatically evolving dark state ( i.e. stirap ) @xcite .",
    "spontaneous heating of the condensate is undesirable in any case , therefore we are required to work in a regime where the photon scattering rate is small regardless of the state description .",
    "- @xmath10 coupling configuration . ]    the beam interaction geometry we have chosen is shown in fig [ fig : geom ] .",
    "the two raman beams are copropagating , parallel to the quantization axis defined by the magnetic bias field .",
    "they are @xmath11 and @xmath10 polarized so that coupling occurs between states with @xmath12 . because the beams are collinear , the atoms change in kinetic energy due to the raman transition is many orders of magnitude smaller than the condensate momentum distribution .",
    "this makes it possible to drop the kinetic energy terms from the hamiltonian .",
    "it is also important to note that after the optical interaction the populations in different internal states have no significant relative momentum , and remain physically overlapping after the interaction has taken place .",
    "although we have limited the model and results presented here to the @xmath11 and @xmath10 coupling configuration , it should be possible to extend these results to include @xmath13 transitions .",
    "this would allow all of the zeeman sublevels in a manifold to be accessed , instead of the subset corresponding to @xmath12 . by using beam modes with polarization components in the direction of propagation",
    ", this can be accomplished while still using a collinear beam geometry , i.e. by driving anomalous raman transitions @xcite .",
    "experimental work exploring this intriguing possibility is in progress .",
    "one important feature we wish to highlight in the model presented here is the consideration of complex - valued rabi frequencies . for interactions involving plane waves it is customary to constrain the rabi frequencies to be real valued by factoring out an overall phase . for multimode configurations where the relative phase of the raman beams is allowed to vary spatially ,",
    "the rabi frequencies can not be treated as real valued over the entire interaction region .",
    "the experimental results presented in section [ sec : results ] involve spatially uniform interactions , and so do not address this additional degree of freedom in the system , however the implications for multimode interactions will be discussed in the conclusions .    in the theory and experiments described in this article , the detunings of the laser fields have been considered to lie within a range spanning about twice the excited state hyperfine splitting of 816 mhz .",
    "we will show that for the @xmath0rb d@xmath3 transitions there is a wide range of of intensities and detunings for which the coherent two - photon effects dominate and the photon scattering rate is negligible . in addition , we limit our consideration to rabi frequencies much smaller than the excited state hyperfine splitting , also noting that counter - rotating terms in the hamiltonian are typically far enough from resonance with any real transitions that they can be neglected . for alkali atoms with smaller hyperfine splittings , such as sodium , resonant excitation places tighter limits on the range of detunings that are experimentally useful .",
    "bearing in mind all of these considerations , one can write a hamiltonian for the system in the interaction picture @xcite , apply the rotating wave approximation , and adiabatically eliminate the excited states @xcite .",
    "this procedure gives a greatly simplified effective hamiltonian for the system which is valid and useful for most interaction configurations of experimental interest .",

    "this bec is then released from the magnetic trap and allowed to expand for 9 ms to a diameter of @xmath94 @xmath60 m , in the presence of a weak magnetic bias field .",
    "the average density of the bec is then @xmath95atoms/@xmath96 , and the mean field energy shift is on the order of a few tens of hertz , which is experimentally negligible .",
    "once this target is prepared , the raman beams are pulsed on during an interaction time lasting 5 - 30 @xmath60s , depending on the experiment .",
    "the diameter of the raman beams is large enough ( 1.7 mm ) to ensure that the beam intensity is essentially uniform over the area of the bec , with @xmath97 .",
    "the magnetic bias field over this region is uniform to better than 1 mg at the maximum applied field strength of 17 g.    after the laser interaction , we determine the final distribution of population among the zeeman sublevels by applying a strong transverse magnetic field gradient of @xmath98300 g / cm for 1 ms , which causes a stern - gerlach separation of the different spin components during a subsequent 20 ms time - of - flight @xcite .",
    "the field gradient is uniform to within @xmath9910% over the condensate , which is sufficient to avoid significant distortion due to magnetic lensing during the separation process . once separated , the clouds are imaged using typical absorption imaging techniques .",
    "the population in each zeeman sublevel is quantified by integrating the measured density over the appropriate regions of the image , correcting for variations in background level .",
    "the ratio of population in the target state to the total population can then be calculated and compared to theoretical predictions .",
    "the details of the individual experimental tests we conducted are explained below .",
    "the primary test of the model and the protocols we have derived is to see whether complete population oscillation occurs at the frequency predicted for the specified intensities of the @xmath11 and @xmath10 fields .",
    "although the typical method of observing rabi oscillations is to apply a field and vary the duration of interactions , this approach is not ideal for testing of our model of the system .    the approach we chose to use to observe rabi oscillations in our system was to hold the pulse duration constant and increase the intensities in the ratio indicated by the equations , observing the resulting change in the target state population .",
    "any mismatch between theory and experiment would result in the system being driven increasingly out of resonance at higher pulse intensities by the increasing light shifts .",
    "another motivation to perform such a test is that the model was developed with the intention to apply it to laser modes with spatially varying intensity .",
