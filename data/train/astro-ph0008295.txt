    "recent x - ray missions have brought a rapid progress in our understanding of the x - ray properties of seyfert galaxies ( for a review see mushotzky , done & pounds 1993 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies as observed by , and recently _ bepposax _ have proved to be very complex ( smith & done 1996 ; turner et al .",
    "1997 ) . in broad terms most seyfert 2 x - ray spectra can be well fitted by a power - law continuum ( typically @xmath2 ) , plus an fe - k emission line at 6.4 kev and a reflection component ( e.g. lightman & white 1988 , george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "this latter component , which suggests the presence of a large amount of cold material in the vicinity of the nucleus , flattens the observed continuum and can dominate the spectrum above @xmath3 kev . in most seyfert 2s",
    "the above emission components are viewed through a large absorbing column density , typically @xmath0 .",
    "this screen , which suppresses the soft x - ray emission through the process of photoelectric absorption in cool atomic and molecular gas , is possibly associated with a large ( pc scale ) molecular torus . in the limit of very high column densities ,",
    "thomson scattering will also diminish the more penetrating hard x - ray emission . in some sources additional emission in the form of a soft x - ray excess",
    "is observed below @xmath4 kev probably as a result of scattering of the intrinsic power - law continuum by a strongly photoionised medium ( eg griffiths et al .",
    "1998 in the case of markarian 3 ) . in order to observe such soft x - ray emission",
    "it is clearly a requirement that the scattering medium should extend beyond the bounds of the obscuration of the molecular torus .",
    "the x - ray spectra of seyfert-2 galaxies gave wide support to the standard agn unification model ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) . according to this paradigm , the nucleus ( supermassive black hole , accretion disc and broad line region )",
    "has basically the same structure in both type 1 and type 2 seyferts , but depending on the circumstances , can be hidden from view by the molecular torus ( krolik & begelman 1986 ) .",
    "specifically if the source is observed at a sufficiently high inclination angle , and thus the line of sight intersects the torus , it would be classified as a seyfert 2 , whereas for all other orientations it would be deemed to be a seyfert 1 .",
    "in contrast to the recent progress in understanding the x - ray spectral characteristics of seyfert 2 galaxies , our knowledge of their x - ray variability properties remains limited . according to the standard unification scenario , the hard x - ray continuum should vary with large amplitude in a similar way to that observed in seyfert 1 galaxies ( mushotzky , done & pounds 1993 ) .",
    "however , in seyfert-2s a large fraction of the emission must come from reprocessed radiation . since a large fraction of the fe - k line ,",
    "the reflection emission and the soft excess are likely to originate from regions of parsec scale - size , it follows that significantly less variability might be expected in seyfert 2 objects , at least in those parts of the spectrum where the reprocessing makes a substantial contribution to the overall flux .",
    "time variability studies can provide strong constraints on the geometry of the nucleus and the surounding region . for example",
    ", the time lag between the variation of the power - law continuum and the fe line flux or the reflection component would give information on the location and the size of the reflecting material .",
    "in particular if a large amount of the fe line originates from the accretion disk , instead of the torus , we would expect variations of the line flux in timescales of days .    here , we present the results from several archival observations on four well known seyfert-2 galaxies : eso103-g35 , ic5063 , ngc4507 and ngc7172 . in another paper ( georgantopoulos et al .",
    "1999 ) we presented monitoring observations of markarian 3 .",
    "the extended energy range of the _ rxte _ pca detectors and the large number of observations for each object give us the opportunity to investigate in detail the properties of the spectral components present in these galaxies such as the intrinsic power - law and the reflection component .",
    "our main objective is to use the variability exhibited in the 324 kev band to place constraints on the geometry of the nucleus and its circumnuclear matter .",
    "the heao-1 hard x - ray source 1h 1832 - 653 has been identified with the galaxy eso 103-g35 at a redshift z=0.013 .",
    "optical spectroscopy revealed a high excitation forbidden line spectrum with weak broad emission line wings and therefore classified this object as a seyfert-1.9 galaxy ( phillips et al .",
    "obtained the first x - ray spectrum showing a power - law spectrum absorbed by a column of @xmath5 ( warwick , pounds & turner 1988 ) .",
    "the observations also showed a variation in the column density over a period of 90 days .",
    "smith & done ( 1996 ) present observations detecting an fe line around 6.4 kev with an equivalent width of @xmath6 350 ev .",
    "the spectrum of the source could be characterised by a heavily absorbed power - law continuum of slope @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "smith & done ( 1996 ) also found evidence for the presence of a reflection component .",
    "turner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) present the first data for this object .",
    "they resolve the fe line into possibly three components ( 6.4 , 6.68 and 6.96 kev ) .",
    "recently , forster , leighly & kay ( 1999 ) presented three observations separated by @xmath6 2 years .",
    "they find some marginal evidence for a double fe line in their first observation .",
    "their best fit @xmath8 and @xmath9 values agree with the results .",
    "they also find that the power - law continuum flux increased by a factor of two while the fe line equivalent width has decreased by about a similar amount .",
    "two observations of eso103-g35 with _ bepposax _ separated by a year , from @xmath62 to 60 kev ( akylas et al . 2000 ) , show a variation of the power - law flux by a factor of two , no variation of the fe line flux while there is no strong evidence for the presence of a reflection component .",
    "comparison of the historical data ( poletta et al . 1996 ) from heao-1 up to asca show a variation of the flux of a factor of about four .",
    "ic5063 is an s0 galaxy ( z=0.011 ) presenting a typical seyfert-2 galaxy spectrum ( colina , sparks & macchetto 1991 ) .",
    "scattered broad @xmath10 emission has been detected by inglis et al .",
    "_ hst _ nicmos observations show a very red unresolved point source ( kulkarni et al .",
    "ic5063 has a radio power at 1.4 ghz two orders of magnitude greater than that of typical seyfert galaxies and thus it can be classified as a narrow - line radio galaxy as well ( ulvestad & wilson 1984 ) .",
    "a observation showed a power - law photon index of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( smith & done 1996 ) .",
    "turner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented two observations of ic5063 .",
    "the spectrum is in good agreement with the observations .",
    "ic5063 shows short - term x - ray flux variability at the 90 per cent confidence level ( turner et al .",
    "however , the and the observation obtained about four years later give similar fluxes .",
    "ngc4507 is a nearby ( z=0.012 ) barred spiral galaxy .",
    "optical spectra present high excitation , narrow emission lines classifying it as a seyfert-2 galaxy ( durret & bergeron 1986 ) .",
    "observations showed a flat x - ray spectrum ( @xmath13 ) , with @xmath14 and a strong fe line ( equivalent width , ew @xmath15 ev ) ( smith & done 1996 ) . instead , osse observations ( bassani et al .",
    "1995 ) showed a steeper photon index ( @xmath16 ) in the 50 - 200 kev energy range suggesting the presence of a strong reflection component .",
    "observations ( turner et al .",
    "1997 , comastri et al .",
    "1998 ) showed a flat power - law index , with a possible variation of the iron line intensity and the absorption column density .",
    "the limited spectral bandpass of did not allow to constrain the properties of a reflection component .",
    "comparison between the and observations show a flux variability of a factor of about two .",
    "ngc7172 is an s0 galaxy ( z=0.0087 ) belonging to a compact group of galaxies ( hickson90 ) .",
    "it is classified as a seyfert-2 galaxy on the basis of its optical spectrum ( sharples et al .",
    "obtained the first x - ray spectrum of the source yielding a photon index of @xmath17 ( turner & pounds 1989 ) .",
    "the same photon index value was also found in a observation of the source ( smith & done 1996 ) .",
    "the data analysis yielded a column density of @xmath18 , and a rather weak fe line ( ew @xmath19 ev ) .",
    "turner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find an ew of @xmath20 ev . the data as well as combination with _",
    "gro / osse _ observations ( ryde et al .",
    "1997 ) show a flat spectrum of @xmath21 and therefore provided evidence for spectral variability between the and epoch .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev flux has been fairly constant during the 1977 - 1989 period at a level of about @xmath22 . however , guainazzi et al . ( 1998 ) presented evidence for significant short term ( hours ) and long term ( months ) variability using two observations separated by a year .",
    "they find a flux decrease by a factor of 3 over a year .",
    "the fe line flux decreased by a similar amount providing important constraints for the size of the reflecting material .",
    "in this work , we present the results from the analysis of the pca ( proportional counter array ) data only .",
    "the pca consists of five collimated ( 1@xmath23 fwhm ) xenon proportional counter units ( pcu ) .",
    "the pcu are sensitive to energies between 2 and 60 kev . however , the effective area drops very rapidly below 3 and above 20 kev .",
    "the energy resolution is 18 per cent at 6.6 kev ( glasser , odell & seufert 1994 ) .",
    "the collecting area of each pcu is 1300 @xmath24 .",
    "we use only 3 pcus ( 0 to 2 ) ; the data from the other two pcu were discarded as these detectors were turned off on some occasions .",
    "we extracted pcu light curves and spectra from only the top xenon layer in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the data were selected using standard screening criteria : we exclude data taken at an earth elevation angle of less than 10@xmath23 , pointing offset larger than 0.02@xmath23 , during and 30 minutes after the satellite passage through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , and when the particle counts electron0,1,2   are higher than 0.1 .",
    "we use the pcabackest v2 routine of ftools v 4.1.1 to generate the background models which take into account both the cosmic and the internal background .",
    "the internal background is estimated by matching the conditions of the observations with those in various model files .",
    "most of the internal background is correlated with the l7 rate , the sum of 7 rates from pairs of adjacent anode wires .",
    "however , there is a residual background component correlated with recent passages from the saa .",
    "therefore , the use of a second , activation component is also employed .",
    "comparison with blank fields observations shows that the above background model represents the real background accurately ( within 1.5 per cent in the 3 - 20 kev band ) .    due to the large field - of - view of the pca detector , contamination of",
    "the observed spectrum by nearby sources is likely .",
    "we have therefore checked the gis 2 - 10 kev images of our sources .",
    "these show no nearby sources ( the gis field - of - view is 40 arcmin diameter )",
    ". however , turner et al . (",
    "1997 ) point out that even the spectrum of ngc4507 may be somewhat contaminated by an adjacent point source ( present in the soft pspc 0.1 - 2 kev band ) .",
    "this source can not be resolved within the limited gis spatial resolution ( about 3 arcmin half - power - diameter )",
    ". possible contamination at radii larger than the gis field - of - view can be investigated using the pspc images of our sources .",
    "indeed , in ngc7172 and eso103-g35 we find bright sources at distances from 30 to 60 arcmin from our targets .",
    "inspection of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) reveals no coincidences .",
    "therefore , these are most probably galactic stellar sources and thus with soft x - ray spectra whose contamination in the band is expected to be small .",
    "in total 43 observations with exposure time of 151.0 , 46.3 , 118.6 , and 78.2 ksec have been obtained with for eso103-g35 , ic5063 , ngc4507 and ngc7172 respectively .",
    "the period of observations ranges from about 7 days for ngc7172 , and 15 days for ngc4507 , up to about 5 months for ic5063 and 7 months for eso103-g35 .",
