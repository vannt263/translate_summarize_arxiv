    "+ the correct treatment of the local charge density built into the density functional method of _ ab initio _ band structure calculations , particularly in the local ( spin ) density approximation ( lda ) , provides a remarkably good description of those materials where the energy structure of the ions , established by the intra - atomic coulomb interactions , is strongly modified by the band formation .",
    "if this condition is not fulfilled , like in many materials containing @xmath4- or -electrons , the band structure method is insufficient .",
    "the parameter which determines if the material belongs to this class of strongly correlated systems ( sces ) is the ratio @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the bandwidth and @xmath2 is the parameter describing the coulomb repulsion between @xmath4- or -electrons .",
    "there are a number of different suggestions of how to treat the failure of the lda method . also",
    ", at least three different definitions of the parameter @xmath2 in use .",
    "the first one was introduced by hubbard  @xcite as the coulomb integral calculated between the wave functions of the corresponding @xmath4- , or -shells .",
    "hubbard also discussed the importance of screening effects on @xmath2 .",
    "this is mainly the slater f@xmath7 integral ( @xmath8=f@xmath7 is commonly used ) . the second definition , which comes from the formulation of the @xmath9-band hubbard model , is @xmath10=[e@xmath11-e@xmath12-[e@xmath13-e@xmath14 , where e@xmath13 is the energy of a @xmath4()-atom with n electrons in the shell .",
    "an uncertainty exists also within this definition .",
    "the recipe used in the so - called lda+u method  @xcite consists of calculation of the energies e@xmath15 and e@xmath11 of an atom either within an impurity - type or super cell approach .",
    "the results are then depending on where , and from where , the electron is removed , the degree of relaxation allowed for the charge on the neighboring atoms and the number of atoms allowed to be involved in the relaxation . in the next step of the lda+u method the found value @xmath10 is used for correcting the potential experienced by @xmath4()-electrons only , in spite of the fact that relaxation of charge on the neighboring sites has been used when calculating @xmath10 .",
    "another approach is to use @xmath16 as discussed by gunnarsson _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is clear from a physical point of view that the intensity of the correlations characterized by the value of @xmath2 should depend on the type of ground state and the approximation used .",
    "progress in this direction has been achieved by beiden _",
    "et al .  _",
    "the definition used in their work , @xmath17 , involves both the coulomb matrix elements in the linear muffin tin method using the spherical approximation ( lmto - asa ) , @xmath18 , and the average population numbers of different shells , @xmath19/[n_p+n_s]^2 $ ] .",
    "both the matrix elements and the population numbers , are calculated self - consistently .",
    "the functional for these band structure calculations has been constructed on the basis of the gutzwiller - type approximation , and been applied to the 3-@xmath4 metals v , mn , ni , cu and 4-@xmath4 metals nb and tc .",
    "the gutzwiller correlation correction influences the value of @xmath20 indirectly , via the variational procedure for finding the population numbers .",
    "if we look at the definition of @xmath10 , the physical values of @xmath21 are determined by self - consistent values of the difference of the many electron energies e@xmath13 .",
    "when we are discussing the ground state , or thermo - dynamical properties , all processes , fast and slow , renormalizing e@xmath13 have to be considered .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath22=e@xmath13-e@xmath15 by long - range coulomb interaction  @xcite leads to a dependence of these energies on the shape of the fermi surface via the frequency - dependent dielectric function .",
    "peaks in the electron density of states amplify the effect of mixing and , therefore , cause a decrease of e@xmath13-e@xmath15 , favoring a delocalization of @xmath4()-electrons . in this paper",
    "we will consider renormalization of @xmath22 caused by _",
    "interactions due to mixing . this will be considered in the present paper .",
    "the description of the high - energy experiments like photo - electron spectroscopies , sometimes requires a different approach ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "a very specific situation can arise in metallic -systems when one of the intra - atomic transitions happens to be in a close vicinity of the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "the scattering processes of the conduction electrons on this transition are resonantly amplified in this case .",
    "therefore , one may expect a strong dependence of all renormalizing magnitudes on the mixing interaction if there is such a degeneracy .    in this paper",
    "we show that the delocalization of -electrons with pressure can be accounted for in a simple model .",
    "we also give quantitative numbers as regards the delocalization in pr .",
    "below , in order to display explicitly the mentioned effect of quasi - degeneracy we consider the periodical anderson model for the case of praseodymium metal in the corresponding region of parameters . here , by means of a diagrammatic perturbation theory from the atomic limit ,",
    "we derive a system of self - consistent equations which determine the physical value of the hubbard @xmath2 , the spectral weights of the @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] electron transitions .",
    "the equations include correlation effects explicitly , without decoupling of the higher order correlation functions to the single - electron population numbers , and describe the dependence of the physical properties involved on the degree of delocalization of the states .",
    "as will be seen below , this procedure always leads to a splitting of the initial value for @xmath2 to many different orbital - dependent @xmath1 . here",
    ", we only inspect the orbitally polarized solution , the effect of crystal - field levels is not taken into account , since the scale of the crystal - field transitions is much smaller than the ones considered here , although it can be included in the formalism .",
    "we start with the periodical multi orbital anderson hamiltonian , @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the site index and @xmath28 is the -orbital index , i.e. the @xmath29 states .",
    "the first term describes the non - conduction electrons , @xmath30 is the band structure energy , which in our case is taken from a self consistent band structure calculation .",
    "the two next terms describe the strongly correlated -electrons , and the last term represents the mixing interaction between the -states and the conduction band .",
    "thus , we will study self - consistently the changes in the band structure caused by the mixing interaction in the background of the strongly correlated -system .",
    "we define many - particle -states , @xmath31 , as @xmath32 and so on for all 14 -orbitals .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators for the -electrons are rewritten in terms of hubbard @xmath33-operators , describing transitions between many - particle states @xmath31 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the expansion is written as @xmath36 we define the transitions @xmath31 to @xmath37 ( @xmath31 to @xmath34 ) as @xmath38 , and the inverse , @xmath37 to @xmath31 , as @xmath39 .",
    "now let us reformulate the hamiltonian and the green functions ( gf s ) for the -operators , in terms of hubbard operators and then use a diagram technique for the @xmath33 operators  @xcite .",
    "the electronic matsubara temperature -green functions should be expressed in terms of @xmath33-operator gf s @xmath40 the @xmath33-operators satisfy the commutation relation @xmath41_\\eta = \\delta_{ij } \\left ( \\delta_{qr } x^{p , s } + \\eta \\delta_{sp } x^{r , q } \\right).\\ ] ] the fact that the ( anti)commutator of two @xmath33 operators is still an operator gives rise to  end  factors ( averages of one @xmath33-operator , @xmath42 ) when the extended wick s theorem is applied to the green functions . in the diagram technique end factors are represented by open ( closed ) circles for the zero ( dressed ) spectral weights .",
    "the zero green functions for @xmath33 , and @xmath43-operators are @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the temperature in energy units ( k@xmath47=1 ) .",
    "@xmath48 denotes the end factors , @xmath49 , which in lowest order are spectral weights , and @xmath50 the energy of the transition @xmath38 entering the locators  @xcite , @xmath51 , for the @xmath33-operator green functions .",
    "averaging the expansion ( [ expansion],[commutator ] ) for the anticommutator @xmath52 gives a sum rule for the spectral weights in the @xmath33-operator green functions .    using a diagram technique for the hubbard operators  @xcite we formulate a mean field theory ( defined as the theory with no energy dependent corrections to the self energy , @xmath53 , and to the spectral weights @xmath54 ) .",
    "the second order graphs are summed to give corrections to the population numbers , @xmath55 , and the frequencies , @xmath56 . within the fermionic hierarchy , the first correction to the population numbers , the ising - model - like , @xmath57 , is given by the sum of ovals , and is shown in fig.[pop2:graph ] .     to the population numbers . ]",
    "we denote the conduction green functions by dashed lines , the locators for @xmath33-operator green functions by full lines , bold full lines and double dashed lines mean the full green functions , and the dots denote the terminal factors ( local spectral weights ) .    the cumulant contribution , @xmath57 ( see fig.[pop2:graph ] ) can be calculated from a generating functional as described by sandalov _",

    "@xcite .     to the population numbers . ]",
    "this procedure gives the expansion of an exponential function .",
    "however , this contribution , in the paramagnetic state , does not change the relative weights of the population numbers and can be omitted . the second contribution @xmath58 , see fig.[pop : graph ] , is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 are structure constants of the algebra and @xmath61 is the temperature and @xmath62    the green function for the conduction electrons are dressed by the interaction as shown in fig.[cond : graph ]        to give @xmath63 ^{-1 } = \\left [ c_{\\mu}^{(0)}({\\bf k } , i \\omega_n)\\right ] ^{-1 } - \\sum_a    p_a { \\cal d}_a(i \\omega_n).\\ ] ] the shift of the frequencies , @xmath64 , comes from the equation shown in fig.[freq : graph ] ,    . ]    and is given by @xmath65 these equations are coupled and accordingly have to be solved self consistently .",

    "if we treat the -states as fully delocalized we have peaks above the fermi - level but the equilibrium properties are not well described ( see e.  g.   ref .",
    "we have studied the scenario of -electron delocalization and dependence of hubbard @xmath2 on the value of the mixing interaction which is assumed to increase proportionally to the external pressure .",
    "the scenario considered emphasizes that the dominant role is played by the -sum rule , connecting excitations in different energy regions and resonant mixing of ( @xmath106)-electrons and hubbard s -excitations .",
    "the mechanism can only exist due to strong correlations .",
    "thus , in our picture , delocalization arises due to the following reasons : first , the strong correlations provide the separation of the -shell into two manifolds in different energy regions .",
    "second , under the application of pressure the mixing increases due to an increase in the overlap .",
