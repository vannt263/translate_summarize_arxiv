    "the contact angle hysteresis has been either completely neglected@xcite or treated in an oversimplified way , where the drop is similar to an oscillator with solid friction.@xcite although these solid - friction models reflect the qualitative picture of the stick - slip process , they do not provide satisfactory understanding of the phenomenon .    to obtain deeper insight into the physics of the stick - slip motion",
    ", a boundary condition suggested by l.  m.  hocking@xcite can be applied .",
    "this condition , which captures principal features of the contact line motion , involves an ambiguous dependence of the contact angle on the contact line velocity : @xmath0 here , functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 describe the deviations of the free surface and the contact angle from those in equilibrium , respectively , and @xmath3 is the critical value defining the contact angle hysteresis ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath4 , which has the dimension of velocity , characterizes interaction between the substrate and the liquid and is referred to as the wetting or the hocking coefficient .    the particular case of @xmath5 , in which the contact line velocity @xmath6 , describes no contact angle hysteresis.@xcite different practically important situations can be addressed by changing @xmath4 . in terms of the a corresponding dimensionless parameter , for instance , @xmath7 , as in relation , these situations range from the completely pinned contact line , @xmath8 ( the contact angle can change ) to the opposite case of the fixed contact angle , @xmath9 ( the contact line is freely moving ) .    in the present study , we consider the dynamics of a hemispherical drop on a normally oscillated solid substrate .",
    "we apply condition without compromise and focus on the role of the contact line hysteresis , which has been recently measured in a similar setup.@xcite based on this approach , we are not only able to quantitatively describe the stick - slip process but particularly to reveal a new interesting feature in the contact angle evolution .",

    "we are interested in the situation of a gaseous ambient , where its density is much smaller than that of the drop and therefore can be neglected .",
    "we assume that the solid substrate is subject to transverse oscillations with an amplitude @xmath12 and a frequency @xmath13 .",
    "we admit that the drop is enough small so that its shape is hardly distorted by gravity .",
    "this assumption ensures that the equilibrium drop surface is hemispherical to very high accuracy , with radius @xmath14 , and the equilibrium contact angle equals @xmath15 .",
    "the amplitude of external driving is considered small in the sense @xmath16 and the frequency of the substrate oscillations is high enough : @xmath17 . at such frequencies , viscous boundary layers , which arise near the rigid plate and near the free surface ,",
    "become very thin .",
    "in other words , the frequency restriction allows us to neglect viscous dissipation in the liquid , which ensures that the approximation of inviscid liquid is justified.@xcite on the other hand , the frequency @xmath13 is assumed comparable with the eigenfrequencies @xmath18 of shape oscillations for a spherical drop of radius @xmath14 . for our consideration ,",
    "only even eigenfrequencies are of interest , which spectrum is defined by the relation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the surface tension .",
    "because of symmetry , we use the spherical reference frame with the coordinates @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the origin at the center of drop and restrict our analysis by the axisymmetric problem . in the accepted approximations , the fluid motion is irrotational , which makes it convenient to introduce the velocity potential @xmath24 . as a result ,",

    "we start our discussion by recalling the fact@xcite that despite the neglected mechanism of viscous dissipation , the hocking condition itself is dissipative . exceptions are the particular case of the pinned contact line ( @xmath8 ) and the contact line freely moving ( @xmath9 ) over the perfectly polished ( @xmath38 ) substrate . because the system under consideration is generally dissipative , any initial state approaches the terminal oscillatory state after a certain transient . in other words ,",
    "any phase trajectory is landing at a limit cycle . because in the case @xmath38 and @xmath139 the decay rate is comparable with the frequency of oscillation,@xcite the transient time is estimated to be a few periods of oscillations . for these reasons , we are mostly interested in the properties of the steady - state oscillations .    to get an impression about the dynamics , we look at the steady - state oscillations of the contact angle , see fig .
