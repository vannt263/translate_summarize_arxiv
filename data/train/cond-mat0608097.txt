    "we use a zeiss microscope with a 50@xmath135 objective of numerical aperture 0.5 and a working distance of 5 mm .",
    "we work with a field of view @xmath136 by using a digital camera with the resolution of 1288 pixels @xmath135 1032 pixels .",
    "we locate the center of each bead position with sub - pixel accuracy , by using image analysis . for the condensed samples",
    "a and b , we use the low frame rate @xmath137 frame / sec , while for the dilute sample c , we record the images at @xmath138 frame / sec .",
    "the long working distance of the objective is necessary to allow the pole of the magnet to reach a position near the sample .",
    "an example of the images of the tracers obtained in sample a is shown in fig .",
    "[ images]a where we can see the black magnetic tracers embedded in the background of nearly transparent pmma particles .",
    "an example of the trajectory in the x - y plane of a tracer diffusing without magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ images]d .",
    "we note that this particular tracer moves away from two cages in a time of the order of @xmath139 hours .",
    "the magnetic field is produced by one coil made of 1200 turns of copper wire .",
    "we arrange the pole of the coil perpendicular to the vertical optical axis , and generate a field with no vertical component .",
    "thus , the tracers move in the x - y plane with a slight vertical motion which is generated by a density mismatch between the tracers and the background pmma particles .",
    "this vertical motion is very small at the high volume fraction of interest here , and therefore we calculate all the observables in the x - y plane .",
    "the magnetic force is calibrated for a given coil current by replacing the suspension with a mixture of @xmath140 water - glycerol solution with a few magnetic tracers .",
    "the distance between the top of the magnetic pole and the vertical optical axis is always fixed , which means that the magnetic force at the local plane depends only on the coil current . at a given current , we determine the velocity of the magnetic tracers at the focal point and calculate the magnetic force from stokes s law , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the viscosity of the water - glycerol solution , @xmath143 is the tracer radius , and @xmath144 is the observed velocity of the tracer .",
    "the uncertainty in the obtained force comes from : ( a ) the uncertainty in the coil current which is @xmath145 , ( b ) the beads , which are not completely monodisperse in their magnetic properties , causes a @xmath146 uncertainty @xcite , and ( c ) the magnetic field is slowly decaying in the field of view , causing a @xmath147 uncertainty .",
    "it is important to correctly determine the initial time of each measurement to reproduce the subsequent particle dynamics .",
    "we initialize the system by stirring the sample for two hours with an air bubble inside the sample ( see fig . [",
    "images]b ) to homogenize the whole system and break up any pre - existing crystalline regions .",
    "then we place the sample on the magnetic stage and take images to obtain the trajectories of the tracers that appear in the field of view .",
    "the initial times @xmath149 are defined at the end of the stirring . after measuring all the tracers appearing in the field of view , a new stirring",
    "is applied , the waiting time is reset to zero , and the measurements are repeated for a new set of tracers .",
    "we have analyzed the pair - distribution function , @xmath150 , and two - time intensity autocorrelation function , @xmath151 , in order to test our rejuvenation technique .",
    "first , fig .",
    "[ gr ] plots the pair - distribution functions of sample a and sample b right after the stirring procedure .",
    "we calculate the pair - distribution functions by reconstructing the packings from 3d confocal microscopy images of size @xmath152 .",
    "we find that the samples do not show obvious crystallized region by directly looking either at the pair - distribution function or the images taken from confocal microscopy .",
    "for these measurements we use a leica confocal microscope .",
    "the pmma particles are fluorescently dyed so that they are ready to be observed by confocal microscopy .",
    "we load the samples sealed in a glass cell on the confocal microscope stage and use a leica hcx pl apo 63x , 1.40 numerical aperture , oil immersion lens for 3d particle visualization in order to calculate the volume fraction and the pair - distribution function .",
    "second , we analyze @xmath153 and show that the sample has been rejuvenated by the stirring process .",
    "we plot @xmath153 for 3 situations : ( a ) after the first stirring process ( @xmath148 ) , ( b ) after the sample has aged for a long time ( @xmath154 ) , ( c ) we then apply the stirring again and immediately plot the autocorrelation function for the new initial time ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the plot show the lack of correlation for the two individual measurements @xmath148 and @xmath155 , thus demonstrating that the sample has been rejuvenated .",
    "technically , we record the temporal image sequence of sample a and sample b , and study the aging by calculating two images correlation defined as :    @xmath156    where @xmath157 is the average gray - scale intensity of a small box ( 20 pixels @xmath135 20 pixels , pmma particles diameter is roughly equal to 20 pixels ) , and @xmath158 and @xmath159 come from the images at different times @xmath1 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we cut one image ( 1288 pixels @xmath135 1032 pixels ) into many boxes , and calculate the correlation of two boxes located at the same position in the two images .",
    "the average @xmath160 is taken over all the boxes in one image .",
    "[ g2 ] plots the correlation function , @xmath151 , of sample a and sample b , which shows aging behavior ( see the inset ) .",
    "[ g2 ] shows how @xmath151 calculated after two stirring processes at @xmath148 and @xmath155 coincide , indicating that the sample can be fully rejuvenated to its initial state by our stirring technique .",
    "the average @xmath161 used to calculate the msd @xmath162 and the mean displacement @xmath163 denotes an ensemble average over the tracers and over the initial time @xmath164 which is varied over a small time interval centered at @xmath32 .",
    "we choose a small coarse - grained time interval compared to @xmath32 , so that we can ignore the aging effect in such short time .",
    "we then regard all the trajectories in this interval region as having the same waiting time @xmath32 . in practice , at a given @xmath32 and a given @xmath165 , @xmath166 , we use the common method ( @xcite , pages 118 - 122 ) of opening a small time window @xmath167 $ ] and perform an average over all the @xmath17 with @xmath168 $ ] and @xmath169 $ ] in order to measure the transport coefficients .",
    "we note that @xmath170 and that @xmath171 is the maximum time of our measurements .",
    "the diffusion and mobility constants are then obtained by averaging not only over the tracers but also over the initial time @xmath164 .",
    "this common technique allows us to obtain an estimation of the diffusion constant and mobility constant by using 82 tracers and 75 tracers respectively for this particular system .",
    "we check that by reducing the region size @xmath172 we obtain the same behavior of @xmath173 and @xmath174 , so that the transport coefficients are independent of the averaging technique .",
    "we collect all the tracers trajectories from several measurements since our system is well reproducible as described in appendix [ experiment ] . in each measurement",
    ", we consider tracers that are separated by at least 10 particle diameters from the sample boundary and from each other .",
    "this guarantees that the tracer - tracer magnetic interaction can be ignored .",
    "in this appendix we address the issue of the proper determination of the long @xmath17-linear regime in the msd where the diffusivity is calculated .",
    "the crossover from the cage dynamics regime to the long time diffusive regime seems to be very gradual in fig .",
    "[ msd]b ( see for instance the case of @xmath175s ) .",
    "we notice that due to the existence of the plateau in the msd , the fitting to the long @xmath17-linear regime is of the form @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is a constant dependent only on @xmath1 and @xmath30 is the diffusion constant .",
    "thus , in the log - log plot of fig . [ msd ] , such a linear relation would not be a complete straight line .",
    "[ note that the logarithmic plot is necessary to observe the different time scales in the experiment , and the fitting constant @xmath177 is the y - intercept of the fitting of the long @xmath17-linear regime , for which there is no particular physical meaning ] .    in order to address the issue of the existence of the long - time linear regime",
    "we compare a log - log plot of the msd with a linear - linear plot of the same quantity for the sample a in fig .",
    "[ linear_regime]a and fig .",
    "[ linear_regime]b , respectively .",
    "we check our results for @xmath178s and @xmath71s .",
    "first we note that the log - log plot of fig .",
    "[ linear_regime]a naturally emphasizes the short time scales of the cage dynamics .",
    "thus , a linear fitting function plus a constant , @xmath179 would be represented as a smoothly varying curve for long @xmath17 in such a log - log plot , giving the impression that the long - time linear regime is not well - defined . in order to determine more clearly the large time regime",
    "we have plotted the msd in a linear - linear plot in fig .",
    "[ linear_regime]b .",
    "the @xmath17-linear regime and the fitting region can be more clearly seen from the linear - linear plot .",
    "the smaller @xmath1 are also plotted in the figure ( @xmath180s ) . as discussed above the linear - linear plot",
    "shows more clearly the existence of the linear regime while the log - log plot shows the existence of the cage dynamics regime .",
    "we also note that the fast motion inside the cage is determined by the viscosity of the surrounding fluid , and not by the macroscopic viscosity which determines the @xmath74 at long times .",
    "indeed , the motion inside the cage is supposed to be equilibrated at room temperature and satisfies the regular fdt according to previous studies , for instance see simulations of lennard - jones liquids @xcite .",
    "the time scales for this microscopic viscosity to dominate is of the order of @xmath181s , as obtained in light scattering experiments of colloidal glasses @xcite .",
    "these time scales are too fast to be studied with our visualization schemes .",
    "our measurements start at @xmath182s and go on up to @xmath73s . in this long time",
    "regime the microscopic viscosity does not dominate the dynamics and indeed we find the @xmath74 is dominated by the macroscopic viscosity given by the particles .    from stokes - einstein relation , @xmath183 , with @xmath184 , @xmath185 the viscosity of the decalin - bromide solution , @xmath186 the tracer s diameter and @xmath187s , we find @xmath188 . at this length scale",
    "the particle experience the viscosity of the surrounding liquid alone .",
    "since we measure much larger displacements , we conclude that the tracers are experiencing the macroscopic viscosity and the effective temperature is therefore well defined .",
    "therefore , we believe that we have achieved the necessary separation of length scales which allows us to define a @xmath74 .",
    "the small displacements observed in the response function are due to the fact that the magnetic forces ought to be small enough to achieve the linear response regime .",
    "the small displacements obtained in our measurements are consistent with previous confocal microscopy studies of colloidal suspensions near the glass transition @xcite , which found motions of the order of @xmath189 of the particle diameter .",
    "figure [ sample c ] shows the parametric plot of correlation function @xmath90 versus integrated response function @xmath190 for the dilute sample c , @xmath191 .",
    "we find @xmath192ms@xmath193n@xmath193 and @xmath194m@xmath195s@xmath193 , corroborating that this sample is equilibrated at the bath temperature @xmath196k within the uncertainty of the experiment .",
    "it is important to test for a well - defined linear response regime for small enough external forces where the mobility becomes independent of the force . indeed , previous work @xcite did not find a linear regime , but instead there is a threshold force below which the particles are trapped even under the influence of the external force . on the contrary",
    ", here we find that if the observable time is larger than the cage life time , particles are always able to explore the structural relaxation leading to cage rearrangements , either in the presence or in the absence of the external force and therefore the linear response regime ensues .",
    "this is because the present experiments focus on larger time scales than previous work .    in order to find the linear response regime ,",
    "we apply different forces for samples a and b. the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ lresponse]a and fig .",
    "[ lresponse]b .",
    "the collapsing of the results onto a single curve of @xmath197 suggest a linear response for lower forces .",
    "the insets show the relationship between the velocity , @xmath198 , of the tracers along the force direction and the force @xmath9 , which indicates that the external force can not be larger than @xmath199n and @xmath200n to keep the linear response for samples a and b , respectively .",
    "it then confirms that the force @xmath201n used in our studies is in the linear response regime .",
    "it is important to investigate the age - dependence of the linear response .",
    "as we addressed in the original manuscript , many measurements have to be taken to reveal the aging behavior for one value of the external force . therefore to measure the aging effect in fig .",
    "[ msd]c , we measured over 75 trajectories to achieve a statistically reliable average .",
    "in order to find the region of forces in the linear response regime , many experiments have to be run at different forces .",
    "thus , for the determination of the linear response we are obliged to use a smaller number of tracers ( roughly 10 ) . in this case , in order to improve the statistical average , we average over the waiting time @xmath1 and obtain a single velocity @xmath202 for each force , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lresponse ] .",
    "( the aging dependence is ignored , and the response functions as shown in fig .",
    "[ lresponse ] are calculated by regular time - translation - invariance methods ) .",
    "this average is only applied to find the value of the external force in the linear response regime .",
    "once this force is identified , then we perform the full aging analysis by measuring a larger amount of tracers .",
    "the density of the magnetic tracers is very close to the background pmma particles . since the sedimentation is proportional to the mismatch between the density of the tracers and the surrounding liquid ( which is the same as the pmma density )",
    ", then we expect that the effect of sedimentation would be small .    in principle ,",
    "this effect is negligible in the more dense sample b since the tracers remain in the x - y plane for few hours without any noticeable sedimentation effect . in the case of the less concentrated sample a",
    ", sedimentation of tracers can be seen after one hour of observation .",
    "since we measure up to @xmath175s , it is important to check the effect of sedimentation on the diffusion of particles for this sample .",
    "unfortunately , we can not test directly the effect of this sedimentation , since we can not match the density of the tracers with that of the fluid and pmma particles ( the tracers are magnetic and therefore slightly heavier than the pmma particles by construction ) .",
    "however we can indirectly test the main issue at hand : what is the effect of an external driving constant force of the order of gravity ( @xmath203pn ) on the tracer diffusion ?    to this end",
    "we apply a magnetic external force of the same value as the sedimentation force and measure the resulting effect on the diffusion constant for sample a. we found that the effect of the external force on diffusion is negligible as long as the force is small enough ( @xmath204pn ) .",
    "figure [ sedimentation ] plots the msd for the sample a at ( a ) @xmath205s and ( b ) @xmath71s .",
    "we obtain the msd analyzing the trajectories of tracers without magnetic force and with magnetic force ( in this case , we properly subtract the average value of the displacements ) .",
    "the figure indicates that the diffusion is the same with or without the external force , thus confirming its negligible effect for this case .",
    "as described in the main manuscript , all the msd for different aging times @xmath32 collapse onto a master curve when plotted as @xmath206 versus @xmath207 . in order to search for the best value of the aging exponents @xmath49 and @xmath50 that give the correct data collapse , we calculate the standard deviation of all the curves as defined below :    @xmath208 ^ 2 .",

    "the local correlation function @xmath90 and local integrated response function @xmath217 studied in the manuscript are calculated from each individual tracer trajectory . in a condensed colloidal sample , the tracer trajectories are always confined at a local position .",
    "therefore , the correlation @xmath90 and response @xmath217 for an individual particle can be regarded as the coarse - grained _ local _ fluctuations of the observables as investigated in @xcite .",
