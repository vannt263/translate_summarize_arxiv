    "the accuracy in photometric measurements depends on many factors , e.g. the precision in modelling the point spread function ( psf ) and its variation across the image , the proper determination of the background and its variance , the definition of the aperture , etc .",
    "sextractor @xcite , the sdss photometric pipeline @xcite and colorpro @xcite are among the most successful and widely used codes for astronomical photometry , although their approaches are very different . sextractor removes the background and estimates the flux of the sources using different kinds of apertures , for instance , circular , elliptical or isophotal apertures . despite its versatility and usefulness , sextractor suffers from certain problems , since it tends to underestimate the background noise and miss the wings of extended objects , leading to an underestimate of the flux and its error @xcite . also , when calculating colours , aperture photometry is measured in different filters degraded to the worst psf in order to measure a constant fraction of the total light in every band and to avoid artificial colour gradients .",
    "this degradation causes the loss of valuable information .",
    "+ the sdss survey provides several measurements of galaxy photometry for different sciences goals .",
    "for instance , the sdss photometric catalogue provides petrosian magnitudes ( which recover the flux within a certain radius , thus providing a fraction of the total flux ) , adequate for nearby , bright galaxies .",
    "model magnitudes are computed by fitting the objects with traditional profiles , such as de vaucoulers or exponential functions convolved with the psf .",
    "this model photometry yields total magnitudes , although @xcite caution that there may be inaccuracy for complex galaxies with significant substructure , which due to the relatively poor quality of the sdss imaging , it is not the case for most sdss objects .",
    "colours are measured within a certain aperture , calculated from a simple profile that is applied to all the different filters .",
    "thus , although very complete and successful for the sloan data , this photometric pipeline is bound to have problems when dealing with higher s / n data which resolve more details of complex galaxy profiles",
    ". + colorpro obtains aperture - matched , psf - corrected photometry without degrading the quality of the images .",
    "it uses a linear combination of the sextractor mag_auto and mag_iso magnitudes for each filter and the detection image .",
    "the result is a highly robust , precise , and unbiased photometry that has been successfully applied to important large surveys , such as alhambra @xcite or clash @xcite .",
    "again , as in the two previous cases , this technique requires knowledge of the psf , which in many cases becomes a difficult , time - consuming task .",
    "moreover , the current version of colorpro is not capable of dealing with variability of the psf across the image since the photometric corrections are calculated globally , degrading the whole detection image to the seeing of each individual filter .",
    "this is not an issue with relatively small fields , but it will hinder its application to the new very large surveys . + when using models to fit galaxies before computing the photometry , as in the sdss , the final result will be highly affected not only by the factors mentioned at the beginning of this section but also by the precision of the fit .",
    "modelling techniques are traditionally classified in two groups : parametric and non - parametric methods .",
    "the first approach includes algorithms as the above - mentioned sdss photometric pipeline , galfit @xcite or galapagos @xcite .",
    "the latter two are also based on simple analytical profiles , allowing the simultaneous fit of several of them .",
    "parametric techniques mostly use profiles roughly similar to the shape of the galaxies , with parameters which are associated to physical characteristics , and due to their low complexity , are straightforward to implement and optimize . however , the selection of the profiles and the determination of the initial parameter values requires intervention from the user , making these techniques less suitable for processing the huge amount of data coming from large surveys . to adapt them for this purpose , it is necessary to highly restrict the parameter space , to avoid them being ill - posed .",
    "this even further limits their flexibility to model the wide variety of morphologies observed in the sky and thus does not accurately represent irregular objects or the substructures present in complex and well resolved galaxies . for these reasons ,",
    "the photometry provided by parametric fits is often inaccurate .",
    "+ the non - parametric techniques @xcite generally use orthonormal bases to model objects , which a priori makes them capable of fitting any kind of morphology .",
    "these methods are purely mathematical ,",
    "so the user does not need any a priori information and the algorithms are fully automated .",
    "they have the drawback of having coefficients whose physical meaning is not easy to interpret .",
    "moreover , these techniques are usually based on continuous and infinite functions , and the transition to the discrete and finite images is not trivial . in spite of these disadvantages ,",
    "models obtained by these methods tend to be more precise than parametric ones , and thus yield better photometric measurements . + the chefs ( chebyshev - fourier bases ) @xcite constitute a non - parametric fitting technique specially developed to efficiently model any kind of galaxy morphology with a very compact and accurate decomposition .",
    "as we show here , they have been applied to the measurement of total magnitudes overcoming most of the problems described above for the previous methods and thus yielding highly precise multicolour photometry without requiring psf measurements , saving a considerable amount of time and effort , as well as leading to a completely automated algorithm , easily applicable to large surveys pipelines .",
    "the chefs will be one of the main tools to yield the precise photometry necessary for the upcoming j - pas survey @xcite .",
    "+ the higher the resolution and s / n of the images , the more difficult it is for both parametric and non - parametric methods to achieve accurate fits .",
    "that is why we use the hudf to test the reliability of the chef photometry . by using real data from the hudf and comparing the results with those of sextractor",
    ", we prove that our photometry is unbiased and extremely accurate .",
    "we have also applied our technique to the new , very deep data from the extreme deep field ( xdf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to compare the results with those from @xcite and to obtain the first public catalogue for this image .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : we briefly describe the chef mathematical background in sect .",
    "[ chef_phot ] as well as the photometric pipeline .",
    "[ test ] is devoted to testing the chef photometric measurements and comparing them to the ones provided by sextractor , using a set of extremely realistic models from the hudf as a sample test . in sect .",
    "[ sect_color ] we extend our test to the colours , comparing chefs with traditional aperture photometry . in sect .",
    "[ xdf_section ] we apply the chefs to the recently released data from the xdf , yielding the first photometric catalogue for it .",
    "we also compare the accuracy of the photometric redshifts obtained by chefs against those from colorpro .",
    "in @xcite , we presented an analytical formula to measure the flux just using the chef coefficients .",
    "now we implement this calculation into an algorithm which maximizes the capabilities of the chef decomposition and incorporates the effect of the psf without computing it nor any kind of correction .",
    "the basic idea is to evaluate the chef models within a frame large enough to enclose all the flux from a galaxy , determining the radius up to which the object extends and measuring its total magnitude .",
    "this will provide a psf - independent measurement of the magnitude , which can be compared across filters , avoiding the time - consuming determination of the psf and the possible errors introduced by it .",
    "+      every bidimensional , smooth , square - integrable function @xmath1 can be fit using the chef bases @xcite , which are composed by chebyshev rational functions and trigonometric waves in polar coordinates : @xmath2    with @xmath3 the chebyshev rational function of order @xmath4 @xcite , which depends on the radial coordinate @xmath5 and the scale factor @xmath6 related to the speed of the functions in reaching the extrema .",
    "@xmath7 is a general expression to represent both @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 a normalization factor to make the final functions orthonormal , with value @xmath11 .",
    "please notice this basis is indexed by two indices @xmath4 and @xmath12 which refer to the order of the chebyshev polynomial that each basis function comes from and to the fourier frequency considered , respectively .",
    "so @xmath1 can be decomposed into the linear combination of these basis functions and some coefficients @xmath13 , the so called _ chef coefficients_. these coefficients are calculated by the weighted inner product @xmath14    the weight is needed to ensure the orthogonality of the basis . it must be noticed that every function @xmath1 will be best fitted using an optimal value for the scale parameter @xmath6 .",
    "compact galaxies need smaller values of @xmath6 whereas extended galaxies are better represented by larger scale parameters . to perform photometric measurements , we also derived in @xcite a formula to calculate the flux enclosed by a circular aperture of radius @xmath15 , just by using the chef coefficients associated to the cosine functions with fourier frequency @xmath16 , since all the other terms are cancelled during the integration process : @xmath17    in this expression the superindex @xmath18 indicates the chef coefficient related to the cosine and @xmath19 is the result of the integration of the chebyshev rational functions in a circular area of radius @xmath15 : @xmath20    where @xmath21 stands for the hypergeometric function in the case @xmath22 . if @xmath23 , then simply @xmath24    in short , taking advantage of the chef compactness , it is possible to calculate the flux inside a circular aperture using just a few coefficients , all of them with zero angular component .",
    "+      as described in @xcite , the chef pipeline is implemented as a python code which automatically selects the optimal number of coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath12 to be computed as well as the optimal value for the scale parameter @xmath6 ( see expression ( [ basis ] ) ) , which was originally closely related to the half - light radius of the galaxy . during the implementation of the chef photometric pipeline for this current work",
    ", we realized that the sextractor estimation of this half - light radius is unstable for faint galaxies .",
    "hence we preferred to substitute the value of the scale parameter @xmath6 by another quantity that unambiguously represents the size of an object .",
    "we defined @xmath6 as the radius of a circular aperture such that its area is equivalent to the isophotal area provided by sextractor .",
    "this parameter @xmath6 is used not only to define the slope of the chef basis functions but also to determine the extension of the postage stamp in which each object is modelled .",
    "the aim is to make it large enough to catch all the light from the source but also small enough to avoid excessive background noise contamination .",
    "we find that a good compromise is setting the stamp radius equal to @xmath25 .",
    "that means that each chef model has an area four times larger than the sextractor isophotal area , which should be more than enough for our purposes .",
    "this modification turned out to be a great improvement in the accuracy achieved by the chef models ( especially for faint magnitudes ) , with more accurate fits using a lower number of coefficients .",
    "it should also be stressed that to get good photometry is not essential to have the exact optimal value for the scale parameter @xmath6 , since the chef bases are flexible enough to get very accurate models compensating the imprecision in @xmath6 with the number of chebyshev and fourier coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "+ once we set the stamp size and evaluate the chef model inside it , it is necessary to find an objective criteria to define the real extension of the galaxies ( that is the limit @xmath15 of the integral ( [ flujo ] ) ) , excluding those areas where the noise dominates the signal .",
    "for each object , the algorithm calculates the radial flux of the chef model ( free of noise ) and determines the radius where it converges ( that is , where the flux reaches a maximum or oscillates by less than 1% of the total flux ) .",
    "this is considered to be the aperture radius containing the full flux of the object , so no corrections for the psf have to be applied to compare across different filters with different psfs .",
    "hence , the correction for the psf is not needed to get the colours . using this radius @xmath15 we integrate the chef model using the eqs .",
    "( [ flujo ] ) , ( [ integral1 ] ) , and ( [ integral2 ] ) , to obtain its total flux .",
    "note that different apertures @xmath15 can be used for each image an object is observed in .",
    "+ to see how the chef flux with increasing radius is compared to traditional aperture photometry in increasing apertures we have randomly chosen three galaxies from the xdf @xcite with different morphologies and calculated both the radial and the cumulative radial profiles .",
    "figure [ exgalaxies ] shows the three galaxies we chose to illustrate the chefs performance , along with their corresponding chef models .",
    "[ profiles ] shows that the resulting curves for the chef models ( dotted lines ) and the original galaxies ( solid lines ) are almost undistinguishable .",

    "solid lines represent the original profiles and the dotted lines are the chef profiles .",

    "+ further information on the code function can be found in section [ chefs_settings ] .",
    "in @xcite the performance of chefs for measuring photometry and shapes was compared to the shapelets technique @xcite . a sample of analytical simple profiles ( srsic functions with indices ranging from 0.5 to 4 and sheared with different levels of ellipticity ) , convolved with different psfs , and blurred with gaussian noise was used .",
    "under these conditions , chefs behaved better than shapelets for measuring both fluxes and shapes , with an homogeneous error independent of the profile and ellipticity of the galaxies and approximately an order of magnitude lower than the shapelets. + in this paper , we have used a more realistic and complex sample of models to test the chef photometry against sextractor .",
    "we have taken the real chef models from the udf adapted to the observational characteristics of a ground - based survey , as if they had been observed by subaru , i.e. , repixelated and convolved with the corresponding psf but without adding synthetic noise .",
    "we have inserted them at random locations in a cosmos field @xcite observed by subaru , so that they have the photometric noise of the cosmos observations . to ensure that we are not biasing our results using these chef models as a testing sample , we also rotated the models arbitrarily and recentred them with sub pixel shifting .",
    "after rotation , interpolation , psf convolution , and noise addition , we can be certain that the final coefficients of the objects have no relation with the original ones .",
    "we have measured the magnitudes of these degraded objects using both sextractor mag_auto parameter , which is the closest to a total magnitude , and the chef algorithm described in sect .",
    "[ chef_phot ] .",
    "we have then compared both measurements with the original analytical magnitude , directly obtained from the udf data .",
    "the results can be seen in figure [ test2 ] , where the comparison of the real magnitudes with the sextractor and chef ones is shown , respectively .",
    "we notice that sextractor tends to underestimate the photometry , displaying a clear bias of @xmath310.1 magnitudes approximately up to magnitude 24 and larger for fainter sources .",
    "this is explained by the small area within the aperture considered by mag_auto .",
    "since these imprecisions are related to the sextractor algorithm itself , they do not depend on the parameter configuration selected .",
    "however , the chefs do not show any kind of bias up to magnitude 26 and the results are much more homogeneous and precise .",
    "the scatter in this case is slightly higher , which is completely justifiable since the chefs calculate total magnitudes and thus have a larger effective area with more background noise .",
    "notice this scatter gathers the contribution of both the imprecision of the chef model and the area - dependent photometric noise .",
    "the improvement of chefs over sextractor for recovering total magnitudes is demonstrated in section 3 .",
    "here we test the accuracy of both techniques in measuring colours . with this purpose we used again the i - band image from the udf and degraded it to the observational characteristics of a ground - based survey , in this case , alhambra @xcite .",
    "we later convolved this degraded image with four different psfs , moffat profiles with index 3 and fwhms ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 , which are close to the real alhambra psfs @xcite . with this procedure we aimed to obtain something similar to a degraded udf image in the @xmath32 bands , but without interpolating the original data in wavelength and morphology",
    "thus , the final colours in these bands should be zero and the test would easily show us the efficiency of the photometric techniques . given that the chefs calculate total magnitudes , we can directly obtain the colours without applying any psf correction .",
    "however , as sextractor does not offer the same possibility , we applied the widely - used technique of degrading our images to match the one with the worst psf and measuring the photometry in 3 arcsec apertures afterwards , running sextrator in dual - image mode .",
    "we have chosen this aperture size because once all the bands are reduced to the same psf frame , all the images have a common psf of 1.2 arcsec .",
    "taking an aperture of this size would be optimal in terms of s / n to measure the photometry of the stars .",
    "however , as we are dealing with extended sources , this aperture would be too small and we would be underestimating the photometry , as in the previous section .",
    "the distribution of the fwhms of the objects in the _ z _ band , is a gaussian centred on 2.8 arcsec .",
    "considering that the pixel scale of the alhambra images is 0.221\" / pix , that means one pixel smaller than the 3 arcsec aperture .",
    "moreover , 68% of the galaxies in this image ( the @xmath33 of the distribution ) have a fwhm equal or smaller than 3 arcsec .",
    "hence this aperture represents a good trade - off between the most extended sources and those which would not require a such a large aperture .",
    "+    , width=359 ]    , width=359 ]    , width=359 ]    figure [ testcolor ] summarizes the results .",
    "the three independent colours @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 calculated for all the objects detected in these four bands are displayed .",
    "it is clear that sextractor measurements remain biased , as previously observed for auto magnitudes .",
    "the bias is noticeable for @xmath34 and @xmath35 colours up to magnitude 25 and 24 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath36 colour does not exhibit this behaviour , since the @xmath37-band is the only one not degraded in the process of matching the different psfs , and thus less distorted during the measurements .",
    "for this particular colour , the efficiency of the chefs and sextractor is similar , with a slightly better performance of the former for faint objects .",
    "however , in @xmath34 and @xmath35 colours the improvement of our method over sextractor is clearer , since the chefs are unbiased up to high magnitudes .",
    "the scatter is comparable for both techniques although slightly lower for sextractor , given that the chefs calculate total magnitudes and the measurement is done over a larger area , as described above .",
    "the extreme deep field @xcite is the deepest area in the universe ever imaged , as a result of the combination of the optical and near - infrared data of the ultra deep field collected by the hubble space telescope during ten years of work and nineteen observation programs .",
    "it provides a superb opportunity for studying very faint objects , with a typical depth of 30 ab mag in most filters . covering 2 arcmin@xmath38 less than the hudf ,",
    "that is , 10.8 arcmin@xmath38 , in 9 filters ( 5 optical with the acs and 4 near - ir with the wfc3 ) , these nine bands add up to a total exposure time of 21.7 days . both the photometric depth and the high s / n of this image make this field an unique dataset to show the performance of the chefs .",
    "the analysis consists of three basics steps , that can be summarized in : 1 ) obtaining suitable sextractor configuration parameters to detect the sources in the image , 2 ) decomposing the detected objects into chef components , and 3 ) running bpz @xcite to calculate the photometric redshifts .",
    "we finally compare our results to the ones published in @xcite .",
    "+      following the same strategy described by @xcite , we created a detection image by coadding all the optical filters , that is , @xmath39 . the unusual depth and exposure time of these data",
    "make the field contain very inhomogeneous objects , some of them highly extended and thus covering many other smaller , foreground and background galaxies .",
    "as the chefs are not able to carry out any detection in the image but just model the objects present in it , we require a detection software .",
    "the chef code uses sextractor software @xcite not only to perform this task but also to calculate some parameters that the chef algorithm needs .",
    "the precision , speed and simplicity of sextractor yield it the most suitable to be integrated in the chef pipeline .",
    "however , finding a perfect sextractor configuration file that detects all the objects in the xdf coadded image is not straightforward , since extended galaxies can result deblended if the parameters favour the search for small objects .",
    "nevertheless , the compact , faint sources can remain undetected if the configuration is settled to efficiently find the largest , brightest galaxies .",
    "for that reason , we explored the complete parameter space of sextractor configuration to find out the set of values which maximized the number of detections with @xmath40 ( calculated using kron apertures , with kron parameters phot_autoparams = 1.6 , 2.5 , as chosen by @xcite ) and minimized the number of spurious detections @xcite . + as a result of this analysis , we finally required each detection to have 4 contiguous , 1.0@xmath28 pixels above the background , globally estimated with back_size = 32 and back_filtersize = 3 .",
    "the resulting deblending parameters were deblend_nthresh = 32 and deblend_mincont = 0.005 .",
    "we visually inspected the segmentation - map , ensuring the extended galaxies were properly detected and not split .",
    "+ with this configuration , we detect a total number of 35732 objects , 10823 of which have @xmath41 according to the values of the kron parameters mentioned above .",
    "the catalogue by @xcite for the udf contains a total of 18633 sources above this threshold ( notice the area covered by the udf is larger , and the definition of s / n is different in this case , since it is calculated using the photometry and photometric errors provided by colorpro )",
    ". figure [ num_cuentas ] shows the number of sources detected for both the xdf and the udf on each band as a function of the corresponding total magnitude .",
    "magnitudes were calculated either by the chefs or by colorpro , according to the case .",

    "chefs call sextractor in dual - image mode ) , and used the output information to analyze the data of the nine optical and near - ir filters .",
    "the chefs firstly sort the objects by mag_auto magnitude and decompose them one by one , subtracting every chef model before fitting the following one .",

    "notice this parameter is independently evaluated for each band and does not come from the detection image .",
    "therefore , the same object will have a different scale @xmath6 depending on the filter and its models will be computed within circular stamps of different size given that the radius is set to @xmath25 .",
    "it is also important to remark that the same object can exhibit different shapes when observed by different filters , thus introducing artificial colour gradients in aperture photometry .",
    "+ to decompose each object , the chefs firstly subtract the background corresponding to that stamp .",
    "two possibilities are available for this step , letting the user choose between using the background - map provided by sextractor or locally estimating the background and its noise using an internal algorithm .",
    "this algorithm , as sextractor does for non - crowded fields , computes the background as the mean of the pixels on the stamp that do not belong to any source ( information provided by the sextractor segmentation - map ) , after iteratively discarding all those pixels above the @xmath42 level .",
    "the difference with sextractor is that we do not just estimate the background noise scaling the pixel - to - pixel noise with a formal gaussian , thus assuming a poissonian background noise distribution at large scales , but find the empirical relation of the noise with the aperture size .",
    "the standard image processing ( dithering , degradation , stacking , ... ) introduces correlations between neighbouring pixels making the background noise in images different from a poissonian distribution .",

    "for the sake of a fair comparison between the chefs and colorpro , we show not only the chef results using all the bands available for the xdf , but also the results taking the information from just six of the xdf filters , those most similar to the hudf bands used in coe s work , that is f105w , f160w , f435w , f606w , f775w , and f850lp . in this plot",
    "we show the photometric redshift precision reached by the chefs using the data from the xdf and the one obtained by colorpro using the hudf .",
    "the precision is plotted versus the @xmath46 parameter ( left ) and the @xmath47 total magnitude ( right ) .",
    "please notice that , for both photometries , the @xmath46 have been calculated using the same sigma_expected value to integrate the same fraction of probability around the main peaks , so the comparison of this parameter for colorpro and the chefs is consistent .",
    "when using the same number of bands , ( red solid and blue dashed lines ) both methods display a comparable level of accuracy as a function of the @xmath46 , with a slightly better behavior for colorpro .",
    "however , the number of objects with high @xmath46 ( thus , with an unequivocal redshift estimation ) is four times larger for the chefs than for colorpro , which means that the chef colours are more stable and reliable .",
    "the chefs colours are better fitted by the bpz templates , which can eventually be interpreted as a more precise ( less noisy ) photometry . as for the magnitudes ,",
    "colorpro behaves again slightly better than the chefs except for the brightest galaxies , where the chefs perform much more accurately .",
    "black dotted lines show the huge improvement that the xdf data represents compared to the traditional hduf images .",
    "the addition of the complete set of nine filters to the analysis along with the extraordinary depth of the xdf make the precision of the final chef catalogue increase drastically , down to 2% of error .",
    "+    , obtained with the chefs and bpz , to the 101 spectroscopic redshifts @xmath48 available for the xdf region.,width=321 ]    likewise , we compare in figure [ results2 ] the performance of our xdf photometric redshifts ( using all the available bands ) against the spectroscopic sample of 101 redshifts previously mentioned . we calculate the normalized median absolute deviation , as defined by :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 .",
    "we find this scatter to be @xmath51 for the chefs , value that is comparable to those measured by @xcite ( @xmath52 ) or @xcite ( @xmath53 ) for the hudf , or those obtained by @xcite ( rms scatter@xmath54 ) or @xcite ( @xmath55 ) for other deep fields .",
    "we would like to remark that unlike all these works where a psf - correction or a psf - homogeneization has to be done for every individual image , chefs photometry circumvents this problem and achieves competitive or even better photometric redshift accuracy .",
    "when we compare the mean differences computed for @xmath56 , we obtain better results than those found in the literature , with a mean of 0.0049 for the chefs versus the 0.054 got by @xcite or the 0.017 yielded by @xcite .",
    "the rate of catastrophic outliers , defined as :    @xmath57    is found to be @xmath58 , about @xmath59 lower than the obtained by @xcite of @xmath60 .",
    "note that a small difference in the fraction of outliers will translate into a huge number of objects in large upcoming surveys like jpas .",
    "in addition to the comparison of the precision in the photometric redshifts obtained for the xdf and the hudf using the chefs and colorpro respectively , we also show the difference in magnitude in the overlapping area . in figure [ mag_comparison ]",
    "we represent a logarithmic density - map comparing both magnitudes for the f850lp band .",
    "the results show an excellent agreement for both catalogues up to magnitude @xmath31 29.3 . for fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the chefs photometry is brighter than the colorpro one , which can be explained by the small area used by sextractor to compute these isophotal magnitudes ( which are the base of colorpro magnitudes , before applying the psf correction factor ) .",
    "+        we also study the photometric redshift distribution for the two catalogues , which can be observed in figure [ z_distribution ] .",
    "we represent not only the total distribution considering all the objects in each catalogue but also the distribution of the 14725 objects in the overlapping area of the xdf and the hudf .",
    "we found an excellent agreement with the two distributions peaking at redshift 1.2 ( for the complete catalogues and also for the overlapping area ) , although the hudf catalogue contains a higher number of galaxies with @xmath61 than the xdf .",
    "+     region .",
    "[ _ see the electronic edition of the journal for a colour version of this figure._],width=321 ]",
    "in @xcite we provided the mathematical background of the chef bases , and outlined some of the various applications they have beyond the modelling of the light distribution of the galaxies . in that previous work we showed that the chefs can be successfully used to measure the fluxes of simple , traditional profiles , such as sheared srsic functions . in this paper",
    "we show the chefs are a powerful , precise , and highly reliable tool to calculate the photometry and the colours of real galaxies , displaying a wide variety of morphologies , brightness levels , and sizes .",
    "the chefs algorithm is completely automated , only needing as inputs the image to be processed and suitable sextractor parameter configuration capable of efficiently detecting all the sources in the image .",
    "notice that the chefs do not perform any detection , so they strongly rely on sextractor results for this task .",
    "the chefs fit the objects extracted by sextractor one by one , internally determining the optimal values for the chef parameters involved , such as the scale size @xmath6 or the number of chebyshev and fourier coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath12 . once",
    "a chef model is created , the algorithm uses this analytical function to accurately calculate some parameters such as the ellipticity or the real extension of the galaxy .",
    "this last quantity is particularly important for the photometry since it determines the area where the total flux of the object will be measured . with this strategy",
    ", we estimate total magnitudes , measuring them with variable apertures dependent on the size of the galaxies in the different filters and , hence , without needing the psf . not requiring a psf is precisely one of the most remarkable virtue of the chefs : we avoid introducing new sources of error in the photometry due to a wrong determination of the psf , inaccuracies in its centering , and variability across the image .",
    "in addition , we save a great amount of computational and human time since our algorithm is entirely automated .",
    "+ we have tested the chef algorithm with real optical and infrared data , both ground and space - based , affected by highly different observational conditions , background distributions and intensities , and psfs .",
    "we have compared our results with those from the two software packages that are most widely used currently : sextractor and colorpro .",
    "sextractor can calculate different types of photometry , although it does not apply any psf correction .",
    "we have compared our total magnitudes to its mag_auto ones ( using data from the hudf and cosmos ) , obtaining clearly biased results for the sextractor measurements .",
    "we have later implemented the traditional technique of degrading all the images to the one with the worst seeing to calculate the colours using the sextractor aperture photometry , and compared them to the chef colours coming from the total photometry .",
    "again , sextractor results remain biased while the chef colours are much more precise .",
    "+ we have finally tested our algorithm against colorpro , which does not degrade the quality of the images but applies a psf correction factor to each source .",
    "we have used the real data from the recently published xdf with the aim of not only comparing the methods with the widely used catalogue from @xcite , but also creating the first public catalogue for these data .",
    "the results show that the chefs performance is comparable to colorpro , with a similar level of accuracy in spite of using less information than the latter , since we do not need to estimate neither the psf or its the effect on the photometry .",
    "+ the two catalogues strongly agree up to magnitude @xmath31 29.3 and the redshift distributions of the sources also show a high concordance , both of them peaking at redshift @xmath31 1.2 .",
    "our final catalogue provides precise information for 35732 objects .",
