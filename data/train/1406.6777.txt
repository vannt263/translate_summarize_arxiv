    "a particle bouncing on the reflecting surface under the effect of gravity represents one of the analytically solvable models in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "gibbs introduced the name  quantum bouncer \" @xcite for the object , and it was extensively studied in many articles of pedagogical orientation @xcite and original research papers ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the practical interest in this model has emerged from recent experiments aimed at probing the coherence properties of bose - einstein condensates falling under gravity and bouncing off a mirror formed by a far - detuned sheet of light @xcite , quantum reflection of matter waves @xcite , and measuring the casimir - polder force acting upon the atoms near solid surfaces @xcite .",
    "another important result linked to the quantum bouncer problem has been the experimental observation of quantum bound states of neutrons in the earth s gravitational field @xcite . in these pioneering experiments the quantum states of matter formed by a gravitational field",
    "were observed for the first time . also , the model is of particular interest from the viewpoints of the physics and applications of quantum states of nanoparticles in the vicinity of surfaces @xcite .",
    "an optical analogue of the quantum bouncer , a photon bouncing ball , was experimentally demonstrated using the circularly curved optical waveguide @xcite .",
    "significance of the model for the study of the dynamics of particles in quantum - classical interface was pointed out in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the quantum bouncer model to the nonlinear domain by considering the dynamics of a matter wave soliton governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "the linear potential entering the gpe represents the earth s gravitational field acting on the soliton in vertical direction , while the horizontal atomic mirror @xcite created by a laser beam or magnetic field stands for the reflecting surface .",
    "the matter wave soliton performs bounded motion in such a gravitational cavity .",
    "the effect of nonlinearity , originating from the atomic interactions in bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , shows up as an ability of the bouncing wave packet to remain localized during the evolution , behaving like a rigid ball , rather than a deformable wave packet .",
    "the possibility of tuning the atomic interactions in the condensate by external magnetic @xcite and optical @xcite fields opens perspectives in exploring the bouncer problem in both the quantum and classical limits .",
    "our main objective is to develop analytical description of the soliton s dynamics above the atomic mirror under the effect of gravity . as an illustration of the developed model we consider the resonant oscillations of the soliton s center of mass position under periodically varying strength of nonlinearity and the slope of the quasi-1d trap with respect to the horizontal reflecting surface .",
    "the strength of nonlinearity can be tuned using the feshbach resonance technique @xcite , or alternatively , by changing the strength of the radial confinement . in numerical simulations",
    "we demonstrate the fermi type acceleration of the soliton when the vertical position of the mirror is periodically varied in time . it should be noted that fermi acceleration of matter wave packets was previously considered in @xcite for the case of non interacting bec , in the setting where matter wave solitons do not exist . in these works",
    "non - dispersive acceleration of the wave packet was reported to take place under certain conditions , when the modulation strength and frequency provide the dynamical localization of the matter wave .",
    "the advantage of the present setting is that , the bouncing matter wave packet preserves its integrity due to the focusing nonlinearity of the bec , which counteracts the dispersive spreading .",
    "another interesting approach to acceleration of a single quantum particle , also feasible in the context of matter waves , was reported in @xcite .",
    "the mechanism consists in binding the wave packet by a delta function potential well and involving in accelerated motion along with the potential . in the linear case and ideal mirror",
    "potential our model reduces to the equation which has analytic solution in terms of airy functions .",
    "the dynamics of airy beams currently represents one of the actively explored topics motivated by important applications in optical communications and nonlinear optics @xcite .",

    "the bose - einstein condensate is a giant matter wave packet which is strongly affected by gravity .",
    "in particular , a matter wave packet released from the trap falls towards earth like a bunch of coherent atoms .",
    "the effect of gravity is essential for the operation of atom lasers @xcite .    in the present model the gravitational field acting on atoms in the vertical direction and a horizontal atom mirror which reflects them back , form a cavity for the matter wave packet .",
    "below we consider the motion of a matter wave soliton within such a gravitational cavity .",
