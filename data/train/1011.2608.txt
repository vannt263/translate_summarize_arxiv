    "the work of watts and strogatz @xcite and barabsi and albert @xcite at the end of the last century initiated new interest in this field .",
    "the subject is at the intersection between graph theory and probability theory .",
    "one can see , for example , @xcite for book - length treatments .",
    "the spectral graph theory is the study of the properties of a graph in relationship to the characteristic polynomial , eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its adjacency matrix or laplacian matrix . for reference",
    ", one can see books @xcite for the deterministic case and @xcite for the random case , and literatures therein .",
    "the spectral graph theory has applications in chemistry @xcite where eigenvalues were relevant to the stability of molecules . also , graph spectra appear naturally in numerous questions in theoretical physics and quantum mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for connections between the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices and the laplacian matrices of graphs and cheeger constants , diameter bounds , paths and routing in graphs ,",
    "one can see @xcite .",
    "although there are many matrices for a given graph with @xmath0 vertices , the most studied are their adjacency matrices and the laplacian matrices .",
    "typically , random graphs are considered with the number of vertices @xmath0 tending to infinity .",
    "many geometrical and topological properties can be deduced for a large class of random graph ensembles , but the spectral properties of the random graphs are still uncovered to a large extent .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the spectral properties of the adjacency and the laplacian matrices of some random graphs .",
    "the framework of the two matrices will be given next .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be a graph , where @xmath3 denotes a set of @xmath0 vertices @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the set of edges . in this paper , we assume that the edges in @xmath6 are always nonoriented . for basic definitions of graphs , one can see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the adjacency matrix and the laplacian matrix of the graph are of the form @xmath7 and @xmath8 with relationship @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a diagonal matrix .",

    "thus , the adjacency matrix @xmath11 is always symmetric .",
    "if the graph is also simple , the entry @xmath12 for @xmath13 only takes value @xmath14 or @xmath15 with @xmath14 for an edge between @xmath16 and  @xmath17 , and @xmath15 for no edge between them .",
