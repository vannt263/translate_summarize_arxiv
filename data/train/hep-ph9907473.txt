    "uncovering the origin of particle masses is set to dominate the coming decade in high energy physics .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the higgs mechanism @xcite gives rise to all vector boson and fermion masses present in the standard model ( sm ) and indirect experimental evidence points to the existence of a light higgs , possibly in the range predicted by the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "the mssm is attractive to theoreticians for several reasons , mostly , however , because supersymmetry stabilizes the quadratic divergences of scalars when the theory is extrapolated to gut - scale energies .",
    "if one believes in such vast extrapolations , the sm - higgs must be in a window between roughly 130 - 180 gev due to restrictions on vacuum stability and the perturbative framework respectively @xcite , not considering fine tuning ( hierarchy ) problems .",
    "alternatively , a lighter higgs mass would indicate the scale at which to expect new physics @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry and the requirement of anomaly cancellation both require al least two complex higgs doublets in the mssm leading to five physical degrees of freedom , two neutral cp - even ( h , h ) , one neutral cp - odd ( a ) and two charged higgs bosons ( h@xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a general two doublet higgs model ( 2dhm ) , the mssm higgs sector has ( at tree level ) only two free parameters , commonly chosen as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of up - and down - type higgs bosons , @xmath1 , and the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs , @xmath4 .",
    "the lightest neutral scalar , h , in this model must be below 130 gev @xcite .",
    "any supersymmetric extension of the sm must , in order to be phenomenologically viable , contain terms in the lagrangian which break it .",
    "commonly one introduces so called soft susy - breaking terms which can be thought to originate from supergravity or gauge mediation for instance @xcite . in typical ` sugra ' scenarios , the squark and gaugino scales are each degenerate at the susy - gut scale and mass terms then evolve down to electroweak ( ew ) energies .",
    "ew - symmetry breaking in these models is then brought about by the higgs boson mass parameter @xmath10 developing a negative vacuum expectation value @xcite .    while _ a priori _ a multitude of possibilities exists considering all the undetermined parameters of models beyond the sm , plausible susy scenarios often predict heavy pseudoscalar masses , @xmath11 gev @xcite . at the lhc proton proton collider",
    "the sensitivity to these values of @xmath4 is very limited . a negative higgs search at lep ii would lead to a lower bound @xmath12 in the mssm .",
    "values of @xmath13 imply that for pseudoscalar masses above 250 gev the lhc would not be able to provide information on @xmath4 for intermediate values of @xmath1 and above 500 gev , only for very large @xmath1 the @xmath14 decay could be utilized @xcite .    in this context",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to study observables which possess a large enough sensitivity to @xmath4 in the decoupling limit compared to the sm prediction .",
    "the partial higgs width @xmath15 , measured at the @xmath16 compton - backscattered option of a future linear @xmath17 collider , is such a quantity @xcite .",
    "the decoupling limit of the diphoton higgs width was studied in ref . @xcite",
    "and it was found that the mssm and sm predictions can differ by up to 10 % in this limit .",
    "it was recently demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that using conservative assumptions an accuracy of 2% is feasible at a plc . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the status of radiative corrections to both the signal ( s ) @xmath18 and background ( bg ) process @xmath5 , @xmath6 and then present new monte carlo results assuming a slightly more optimistic ( but still realistic ) detector performance as in @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in section [ sec : con ] in the above context of achievable precision measurements at a future photon photon collider .",
    "there has been considerable progress in the theoretical understanding of the bg to the intermediate mass higgs boson decay into @xmath7 recently . the born cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : born ] for the @xmath19 channel is suppressed by @xmath20 relative to the @xmath21 which means that by ensuring a high degree of polarization of the incident photons are feasible in presently considered designs , e.g. ref .",
    "] one can _ simultaneously _ enhance the signal and suppress the background .",
    "qcd radiative corrections can remove this suppression , however , and large bremsstrahlung and double logarithmic corrections need to be taken into account .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the exact one loop corrections to @xmath22 were calculated and the largest virtual correction was contained in novel non - sudakov double logarithms .",
    "for some choices of the invariant mass cutoff @xmath23 even a negative cross section was obtained in this approximation .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite elucidated the physical nature of the novel double logarithms and performed a two loop calculation in the dl - approximation .",
    "the results restored positivity to the physical cross section . in ref .",
    "@xcite , three loop dl - results were presented which revealed a factorization of sudakov and non - sudakov dl s and led to the all orders resummation of all dl in form of a confluent hypergeometric function @xmath24 .",
    "the general form of the expression is @xmath25 .",
    "fig [ fig:4l ] demonstrates that at least four loops on the cross section level are required to achieve a converged dl result @xcite .",
    "+    at this point the scale of the qcd - coupling is still unrestrained and differs by more than a factor of two in - between the physical scales of the problem , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this uncertainty was removed in ref .",
    "@xcite by introducing a running coupling @xmath28 into each loop integration ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rg ] ) , where @xmath29 denotes the perpendicular sudakov loop momentum .",
    "+    the effect of the rg - improvement lead to @xmath30 and the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vps ] for two choices of the gluon energy cutoff @xmath31 compared to the theoretically allowed upper and lower limits of the dl - approximation evaluated at @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively . in each case",
    "the rg - improved result remains inside the two dl - limits .",
    "the effective scale , defined simply as the one used in the dl - approximation which gives a result close to the rg - improved values , depends on @xmath34 , however in general is rather much closer to @xmath26 than @xmath27 @xcite .    on the signal side ,",
    "the relevant radiative corrections have long been known up to nnl order in the sm @xcite and are summarized including the mssm predictions in ref .",
    "for our purposes the one loop corrections to the diphoton partial width depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hgg ] are sufficient as the qcd corrections are small in the sm . the important point to make here and also",
    "the novel feature in this analysis is that the branching ratio br ( @xmath35 ) is corrected by the same rg - improved resummed qcd sudakov form as the continuum heavy quark background @xcite .",
    "this is necessary in order to employ the same two jet definition for the final state .",
    "since we use the renormalization group improved massive sudakov form factor @xmath36 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we prefer the sterman - weinberg jet definition @xcite schematically depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : jet ] .",
    "we also use an all orders resummed running quark mass evaluated at the higgs mass for @xmath37 . for the total higgs width",
    ", we include the partial higgs to @xmath38 and @xmath39 decay widths with all relevant radiative corrections .",
    "we begin with a few generic remarks concerning the uncertainties in our predictions .",
    "the signal process @xmath40 is well understood and nnl calculations are available .",
    "the theoretical error is thus negligible @xcite .",
    "there are two contributions to the background process @xmath5 which we neglect in this paper .",
    "firstly , the so - called resolved photon contribution @xcite was found to be a small effect , e.g. @xcite , especially since we want to reconstruct the higgs mass from the final two - jet measurements and impose angular cuts in the forward region . in addition",
    "the good charm suppression also helps to suppress the resolved photon effects as they give the largest contribution .",
    "the second contribution we do not consider here results from the final state configuration where a soft quark is propagating down the beam pipe and the gluon and remaining quark form two hard back - to back - jets @xcite .",
    "we neglect this contribution here due to the expected excellent double b - tagging efficiency and the strong restrictions on the allowed acollinearity discussed below . a good measure of the remaining theoretical uncertainty in the continuum background is given by scanning it below and above the higgs resonance .",
    "for precision extractions of @xmath41 the exact functional form for resonant energies is still required , though .    in terms of possible systematic errors ,",
    "the most obvious effect comes from the theoretical uncertainty in the bottom mass determination .",
    "recent qcd - sum rule analyses , however , reach below the 2% level for @xmath42 @xcite . for quantitative estimates of exptected systematic experimental errors",
    "it is clearly too early to speculate at this point .",
    "the philosophy adopted henceforth is that we assume that they can be neglected at the 1% level and concentrate purely on the statistical error .",
    "we focus here not on specific predictions for cross sections , but instead on the expected statistical accuracy of the intermediate mass higgs signal at a plc . as detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite , due to the narrow higgs width , the signal event rate is proportional to @xmath43 , while the bg is proportional to @xmath44 .    to quantify this",
    ", we take the design parameters of the proposed tesla linear collider @xcite , which correspond to an integrated peak @xmath16-luminosity of 15 fb@xmath45 for the low energy running of the compton collider .",
    "the polarizations of the incident electron beams and the laser photons are chosen such that the product of the helicities @xmath46 .",
    "this ensures high monochromaticity and polarization of the photon beams @xcite . within this scenario",
    "a typical resolution of the higgs mass is about 10  gev , so that for comparison with the background process @xmath47 one can use @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath490.5 fb@xmath45/gev .",
    "the number of background events is then given by @xmath50 .    in principle",
    "it is possible to use the exact compton profile of the backscattered photons to obtain the full luminosity distributions . the number of expected events is then given as a convolution of the energy dependent luminosity and the cross sections .",
    "our approach described above corresponds to an effective description of these convolutions , since these functions are not precisely known at present .",
    "note that the functional forms currently used generally assume that only one scattering takes place for each photon , which may not be realistic .",
    "once the exact luminosity functions are experimentally determined it is of course trivial to incorporate them into a monte carlo program containing the physics described in this paper .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that in order to achieve a large enough data sample , a central thrust angle cut @xmath51 is advantageous and is adopted here .",
    "we also assume a ( realistic ) 70% double b - tagging efficiency . for the charm rejection rate , however , it seems now possible to assume an even better detector performance .",
    "the improvement comes from assuming a better single point resolution , thinner detector modules and moving the vertex detectors closer to the beam - line @xcite .    with these results in hand",
    "we keep @xmath51 fixed and furthermore assume the @xmath52 misidentification rate of 0.5% , ( half of that in ref .",
    "we vary the cone angle @xmath53 between narrow ( @xmath54 ) , medium ( @xmath55 ) and large ( @xmath56 ) cone sizes for both @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the upper row of fig .",
    "[ fig : ssig ] demonstrates that for the former choice of the energy cutoff parameter we achieve the highest statistical accuracy for the large @xmath59 scenario of around 2% .",
    "we emphasize , however , that in this case also the missing @xmath60 bremsstrahlung corrections could become important .",
    "the largest effect is obtained by effectively suppressing the background radiative events with the smaller energy cutoff of @xmath58 outside the cone ( the inside is of course independent of @xmath34 ) . here the lower row of fig .",
    "[ fig : ssig ] demonstrates that the statistical accuracy of the higgs boson with @xmath61 gev can be below the 2% level after collecting one year of data .",
    "we should mention again that for this choice of @xmath34 we might have slightly enhanced the higher order ( uncanceled ) cutoff dependence .",
    "the dependence on the photon - photon polarization degree is visible but not crucial . comparing with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite we also conclude that the new optimized charm misidentification rate leads to only slight improvements for @xmath62 .    in summary",
    ", it seems very reasonable to expect that at the compton collider option we can achieve a 2% statistical accuracy of an intermediate mass higgs boson signal after collecting data over one year of running .",
    "in this paper we have studied the higgs signal and continuum background contributions to the process @xmath63 at a high - energy compton collider .",
    "we have used all relevant qcd radiative corrections to both the signal and bg production available in the literature .",
    "the monte carlo results using a variety of jet - parameter variations revealed that the intermediate mass higgs signal can be expected to be studied with a statistical uncertainty between ( excluding the narrow cone angle scenario ) @xmath64 in a realistic and @xmath65 in an optimistic scenario after one year of collecting data for a higgs - mass which excludes @xmath66 .    together with the expected uncertainty of 1% from the @xmath67 mode determination of br@xmath68 , and assuming _ four _ years of collecting data , we conclude that a measurement of the partial width @xmath69 of 1.4% precision level is feasible for the mssm mass range from a purely statistical point of view .",
    "this level of accuracy could significantly enhance the kinematical reach of the mssm parameter space in the large pseudoscalar mass limit and thus open up a window for physics beyond the standard model .    for the total higgs width",
    ", the main uncertainty is given by the error in the branching ratio br@xmath70 , which at present is estimated at the 15 % level @xcite .",
    "for higgs masses above 110 gev , the total higgs width could be determined more precisely through the higgs - strahlung process @xcite and its decay into @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this is only possible , however , if the supersymmetric lightest higgs boson coupling to vector bosons is universal ( i.e. the same for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) and provided the optimistic luminosity assumptions can be reached .    in summary",
    ", using realistic and optimized machine and detector design parameters , we conclude that the compton collider option at a future linear collider can considerably extend our ability to discriminate between the sm and mssm scenarios .",
