    "a large population of absorbed agn are required to explain the hard spectrum of the extragalactic x - ray background . however , even though absorbed agn outnumber their unabsorbed brethren by a factor of four in the local universe ( e.g. risaliti et  al.,1999,apj,522,157 ) , the demographics of the population at higher redshifts are still poorly understood .",
    "the simple `` unified '' model of agn attributes this absorption to a 1100pc scale dusty torus surrounding the central black hole and accretion disk , where the degree of absorption seen by an observer is determined primarily by the angle at which an agn is viewed . by measuring the distribution of absorption in the agn population we can place constraints on the typical geometry of such a torus . in addition ,",
    "we can test for the existence of a correlation between absorption and redshift and/or luminosity .",
    "therefore , we have examined a sample of x - ray sources detected in the deep _ xmm - newton _ observations of the _ chandra _ deep field - south ( cdf - s ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data in the cdf - s consist of 500ks of observations , of which around 350ks is unaffected by background flares .",
    "this is the 2nd deepest _ xmm - newton _ survey to date .",
    "we subdivide the full energy range of the epic cameras into four bands : 0.20.5 , 0.52 , 25 , and 510 kev .",
    "we detect 299 reliable x - ray sources to a limiting flux of @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 in the 0.52 kev band .",
    "the entire field is covered by deep _",
    "chandra _ imaging ( extended - cdf - s project ; lehmer et  al .",
    ", 2005 , aj , 129 , 1 ) , and the central region is covered by very deep ( 1ms ) _ chandra _ observations ( giacconi et  al . , 2002 , apjs , 139 , 639 ) . for unambiguous optical identification",
    ", we adopt the high accuracy chandra positions where possible .",
    "extensive spectroscopic identification programs have been carried out in the cdf - s especially for optical counterparts of the _ chandra _ sources , ( e.g. szokoly et  al . , 2004 , apjs , 155 , 271 ; zheng et  al . , apjs , 155 , 73z )",
    ". almost the entire _ xmm - newton _ field is also covered by the combo-17 survey ( wolf et  al . , 2004 ,",
    "a&a , 421 , 913 ) , which provides good photo - z estimates for galaxies to r=24 .",
    "we find that 86% ( 258/299 ) of the _ xmm - newton _ detections have identified optical counterparts .",
    "of these , 16 sources are stars , and 5 suffer from source confusion ; these sources are removed from the sample .",
    "we have used detailed simulations in order to understand the selection function and any biases inherent to the _ xmm - newton _ observations ( and the source searching algorithm ) .",
    "we couple x - ray luminosity functions with an empirical absorption distribution model to generate a random synthetic population of `` input '' agn .",
    "the multi - band count - rates expected for each simulated agn are then calculated according to an absorbed power - law plus reflection spectral model , taking into account the epic response .",
    "simulated multi - band images are generated using the epic psf together with the exposure maps and unresolved background of the real observations .",
    "we apply the source searching routine that is used on the real data in order to find `` output '' sources in these images .",
    "each `` output '' source is matched to the appropriate `` input '' counterpart , allowing its output parameters ( i.e. multi - band count rates ) , to be related to input parameters ( i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the simulation process is repeated for the equivalent of 2000 fields in order to populate densely @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 space .",

    "we use this library of simulated sources to find the most likely @xmath2 of the agn in our cdf - s sample . for each agn",
    ", we select all those simulated sources having similar multi - band hardness ratios ( @xmath6s ) , redshifts and full band count rates . the best estimate for the @xmath2 of the real agn",
    "is taken to be the modal `` input '' @xmath2 of this subset of simulated sources .",
    "we have checked the fidelity of this method by using it to recover the known @xmath2 of simulated sources .",
    "we find that for simulated sources at @xmath7 , and with @xmath8 @xmath4 , we are able to recover the input absorption reliably . at higher redshifts , absorption is shifted out of band , and so we are only able to place upper limits for moderately absorbed agn .",
    "we use a similar method to deduce the `` de - absorbed '' intrinsic rest frame 210 kev luminosities of the sample . as before , we select all simulated sources having similar @xmath6s , redshift , and full band count rate to the real agn . the weighted median luminosity of these simulated objects is taken to be the best estimate of the intrinsic luminosity of the agn .",
    "the scatter of the recovered values about the input values is typically less than 0.2dex .",
    "we compare the @xmath0,@xmath2,@xmath1 distribution of the cdf - s sample with those predicted by a number of model @xmath2 functions , coupled with the model xlf of ueda et  al .",

    "we have demonstrated a monte carlo method for accurately estimating the x - ray absorption and intrinsic luminosity in a sample of optically identified agn observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_. our cdf - s sample reaches to high redshifts ( @xmath15 ) , and spans the knee of the luminosity function ( @xmath16 erg s@xmath5 ) .",

    "our @xmath2 estimation method finds evidence for moderate absorption ( @xmath19log@xmath20 ) in @xmath21 agn ; obscuration models where agn are surrounded by uniformly dense tori do not predict large numbers of these intermediately absorbed objects .",
    "the model which best reproduces the @xmath2 distribution of the cdf - s sample is a simple parametrisation , where the number of agn having absorption per unit log@xmath2 is proportional to ( log@xmath2)@xmath22 ( the @xmath13 model ) . after allowing for selection effects in the sample ,",
    "we see no strong dependence of the @xmath2 distribution on either redshift or luminosity in the ranges probed by this sample .",
    "when compared to the three dimensional @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 distribution of the sample , the best matching @xmath2 distribution was again the @xmath13 model , which matched with 3-d ks probability p@xmath23 = 0.01 .",
    "the main source of the disparity is the redshift distributions : the sample is strongly peaked at @xmath24 ( e.g. gilli et  al .",
