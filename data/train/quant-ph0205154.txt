    "for fluorescing quantum systems one of the most important statistical quantities is given by the intensity correlation function , @xmath1 , for photon counts @xcite .",
    "its behavior for small times @xmath2 can indicate more classical or more quantum behavior and bunching or anti - bunching , depending on whether @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "early investigations of the intensity correlation function of single two level systems @xcite led to the observation of nonclassical light @xcite .",
    "the intensity correlation function can also exhibit rabi oscillations , and for @xmath0 systems with metastable state it contains indications of light and dark periods (  blinking  ) in the fluorescence @xcite .",
    "the importance of correlation functions partially stems from the relative ease with which they can be experimentally determined , partially due to the fact that the efficiency of the photon detector does not enter .",
    "correlation functions were determined for single ions in a trap in experiments which were mainly carried out for the detection of quantum jumps in the fluorescence @xcite . in the last decade",
    "the same was achieved for single fluorescent molecules @xcite .",
    "a theoretical determination of @xmath1 was obtained in closed form for three level systems @xcite and @xmath5 was calculated for two dipole - dipole interacting two - level systems @xcite , but for more complicated multi - level systems it is usually done by the numerical solution of bloch equations @xcite . because the intensity correlation function contains information on the system parameters , e.g.  atomic constants like einstein coefficients , these parameters could be obtained in principle from an experimentally determined @xmath1 by fitting numerically calculated curves to the data . however , in general such a fit procedure needs many numerical runs and tends to be highly sensitive to experimental and numerical errors . with an algebraic expression a fit would be much easier and more reliable . moreover ,",
    "if algebraic expression were known for the intensity correlation function for multi - level systems one could study its behavior without recourse to many numerical runs for different parameter values . in the present paper such algebraic expressions of the correlation function will be given for fluorescing quantum systems with light and dark periods .",
    "as a generalization of a result for @xmath0 systems in @xcite it is deduced from this algebraic expression that the correlation function for `` blinking '' systems with dark periods shows a `` hump '' for values of @xmath2 larger than the correlation times of the individual intensity periods .",
    "it is also pointed out that the existence of extended dark periods may considerably enhance the amplitude of bloch oscillations .    as an application we study",
    "two dipole - dipole interacting @xmath0 systems and determine an algebraic expression for the corresponding intensity correlation function @xmath1 .",
    "this expression is used to study the behavior of @xmath1 with respect to the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "it is shown that the dipole - dipole interaction has an effect for small @xmath2 which is particularly pronounced for small values of the strong driving .",
    "we suggest to use this effect to experimentally verify the dipole - dipole interaction for atomic distances of a few wavelength of the strong transitions .",
    "the temporal intensity correlation function for photon counts is defined as follows . in the steady state , let @xmath6 be the joint probability density for detecting a photon both at time 0 and @xmath2 , and let @xmath7 denote the steady - state intensity ( counts per unit time ) .",
    "then @xmath1 is defined as @xcite @xmath8 we consider now a fluorescing system with @xmath9 periods of different intensity @xmath10 and mean duration @xmath11 .",
    "a particular period usually corresponds to transitions within a simpler subsystem which is easier to treat than the complete system . in the following",
    "we therefore assume that within a given period @xmath12 the corresponding intensity correlation function @xmath13 is known .",
    "the intensity correlation function @xmath1 of the larger system can then be determined as follows .",
    "let @xmath14 be the probability for the occurrence of period @xmath12 and let @xmath15 be the probability to have period @xmath16 at time @xmath2 provided one had period @xmath12 at @xmath17 .",
    "now , if at time 0 the fluorescence is in period @xmath12 , then , for @xmath18 , one still is in period @xmath12 with high probability",
    ". therefore , in this case , the joint probability density for detecting a photon at both times , 0 and @xmath2 , is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the joint probability density for period @xmath12 .",
    "since for small @xmath2 one has @xmath21 this can be replaced by @xmath22 for larger @xmath2 one may end up in a period different from that at time 0 . if @xmath2 is larger than the correlation times associated with @xmath13 then , for initial period @xmath12 and final period @xmath16 , the joint detection probability is @xmath23 .",
    "since for such @xmath2 s one has @xmath24 one can write the complete joint detection probability density as @xmath25 this includes equation as a special case since for @xmath2 small one has @xmath26 for @xmath27 .    in this general formula one still has to express @xmath14 and @xmath15 in terms of the transition rates @xmath28 from period @xmath12 to period @xmath16 .",
    "these transition rates themselves can be expressed by einstein coefficients and rabi frequencies .",
    "one has , in particular , @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath15 are easily seen to obey rate equations , e.g. @xmath30 in general , with the matrix @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the matrix @xmath33 one has @xmath34 with the initial condition @xmath35 , or @xmath36 the solution of equation with this initial condition can be written as @xmath37 if @xmath38 are the eigenvalues of @xmath39 ( assumed distinct ) then @xcite @xmath40 the properties of the matrix @xmath39 are closely related to those of stochastic matrices @xcite , and under quite general conditions @xmath39 has a single eigenvalue @xmath41 and eigenvalues @xmath42 with negative real part .",
    "this will be assumed in the following . for up to four intensity periods",
    ", the @xmath43 can be determined in closed form .    to find the @xmath14 s",
    ", we note that for @xmath44 the memory to the initial start is in general lost .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath45 , @xmath46 laplace transforming equation yields @xmath47 thus the @xmath14 s can be calculated without knowledge of the @xmath43 s .",
    "the steady - state fluorescence intensity is @xmath48  .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath49 for @xmath2 larger than the correlation time of @xmath50 one has @xmath51 , and thus equation becomes @xmath52 so that for larger @xmath2 the dependence on @xmath2 of @xmath1 is solely governed by the statistics of the individual periods .",
    "a first simple example is a system with dark ( @xmath53 ) and light ( @xmath54 ) periods , such as the @xmath0 system of with a metastable level or a @xmath55 system @xcite .",
    "the mean period durations are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . because @xmath53 , equation becomes @xmath58 with @xmath59 the correlation function of the two - level subsystem .",
    "a simple calculation yields @xmath60 @xmath61 for a @xmath0 system equation agrees with the result of @xcite if the correlation time for @xmath59 is much smaller than @xmath62 .    for @xmath63 one",
    "has @xmath64 and @xmath65 . since @xmath66 it follows that , for small @xmath2 , @xmath1 is just @xmath59 blown up by the factor @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , possible bloch oscillations of @xmath59 become enhanced in @xmath1 if @xmath68 increases . moreover , for @xmath2 values larger than the correlation time of the two - level subsystem one has @xmath69 so that there is a `` hump '' larger than 1 in @xmath1 . in the case of a @xmath0 system",
    "this hump was already noted in @xcite .",
    "such a hump is a _",
    "general feature _ for any system with a dark period , as will now be shown by means of equation . indeed , for @xmath2 larger than the correlation times of @xmath13 but much less than the @xmath70 s one has @xmath71 , resulting in @xmath72 .",
    "by schwarz s inequality one obtains @xmath73 . since @xmath74 the statement follows .",
    "this does not mean , however , that @xmath1 always stays above 1 for all subsequent values of @xmath2 .",
    "there are systems where it dips below 1 again and then approaches its asymptotic value 1 from below .    in the following , equation for @xmath1",
    "will be studied for an example with three different fluorescence periods and shown to be highly accurate .",
    "we consider two dipole - dipole interacting @xmath0 systems as in at a fixed distance @xmath75 , with one laser driving the strong 1 - 3 transition and another the weak 1 - 2 transition .",
    "such a system exhibits three fluorescence periods , a dark period @xmath53 , a period @xmath76 and a double intensity period @xmath77 .",
    "the transition rates @xmath28 between the periods are known @xcite and are given in the appendix . one has @xmath56 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the distance dependent complex dipole - dipole coupling constant @xmath81 is also given in the appendix .",
    "for @xmath82 the system behaves as two independent , non - interacting , fluorescing @xmath0 systems , and then the periods @xmath83 , @xmath76 and @xmath84 correspond to two , one or no atom radiating . because of @xmath85",
    ", equation simplifies to @xmath86 here , @xmath87 is the usual correlation function of a single two - level system and @xmath88 that of two two - level systems which are dipole - dipole interacting .",
    "these correlation functions are given in the appendix .",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath89 from period @xmath12 to period @xmath16 in time @xmath2 are easily calculated from equation and are also given in the appendix , as is @xmath14 , the probability for the occurrence of period @xmath12 .",
    "the accuracy of equation is checked for two values of @xmath90 in for a coupling constant @xmath91 . if the strong laser and the atomic dipole moments are perpendicular to the atomic connecting line this corresponds to a local maximum at an atomic distance @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the wave length of the strong 3 - 1 transition .",
    "the agreement is excellent and becomes even better if one takes higher orders of @xmath81 into account , instead of only the first order as done here .",
    "the usefulness of equation is twofold .",
    "first , it can be used for a fit to experimental data to obtain atomic parameters and mean period lengths .",
    "experimentally , correlations functions are in general much easier to determine than period lengths .",
    "for such a fit one could also employ numerical solutions for @xmath94 obtained with the quantum regression theorem @xcite or with the quantum jump approach @xcite .",
    "however , the numerical approach is in general much more sensitive to experimental errors than a fit based on an analytic expression .",
    "the second use of equation lies in the feasibility to study the behavior of @xmath1 for all parameter values simultaneously , without having to perform many numerical runs and possibly overlooking interesting parameter values .",
    "this will be demonstrated here by exhibiting a possible experimental test of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "for @xmath95 , one has @xmath96 , so that equation reduces to @xmath97 in particular , one has @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for angle - averaged detection @xcite is given in equation of the appendix . inserting this and",
    "the other quantities into equation one obtains @xmath100 with @xmath101 . to first order in the coupling constant @xmath81",
    "this becomes @xmath102 by varying @xmath90 one has a noticeable change of @xmath5 , which depends on how large @xmath103 is . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "the temporal behavior of @xmath1 is a combination of that of @xmath59 and @xmath88 and can be experimentally resolved",
    ". therefore @xmath5 should be measurable and the presence of the dipole - dipole interaction detectable .",
    "the deviation of @xmath5 from @xmath104 , i.e. from that for non - interacting atoms , is greatest for small @xmath90 and drops off to zero for increasing @xmath90 .    in",
    "we have plotted @xmath5 for various values of @xmath90 and for @xmath105 .",
    "if the strong laser and the atomic dipole moments are perpendicular to the atomic connecting line this corresponds to the atomic distance @xmath75 = 1.2@xmath106 , 1.7@xmath106 , 2.2@xmath106 , 2.7@xmath106 , respectively . since @xmath103 oscillatingly drops off to zero for increasing atomic distance , its influence on @xmath5 diminishes for increasing atomic distance .",
    "as shown in the effect is about a factor of two smaller in the case of two dipole - dipole interacting two - level systems .    to show that the temporal behavior of @xmath1 should be experimentally resolvable",
    "we have plotted @xmath1 in for various values of @xmath90 and for @xmath91 , which corresponds to an atomic distance of @xmath107 for perpendicular laser incidence .",
    "it has been shown for systems with different fluorescent periods that their intensity correlation function can be reduced to those of simpler subsystems and to quantities that govern the stochastic behavior of the different periods .",
    "this is a considerable simplification and allows the determination of an algebraic expression for the intensity correlation function which usually have to be calculated numerically via the quantum regression theorem or via the quantum jump approach .",
    "one of the advantages of an algebraic expression is the feasibility of studying its behavior for all parameters simultaneously , without having to make numerical runs for different sets of parameters and possibly overlooking interesting values .",
    "another advantage is that it is easier to fit experimental data to an algebraic expression and to obtain unknown atomic parameters or period durations by such a fit rather than fitting to numerically determined expression since the latter procedure is usually much more sensitive to experimental and numerical errors .",
    "it has been shown in this paper that the correlation function for `` blinking '' systems with dark periods shows a `` hump '' larger than 1 for values of @xmath2 larger than the correlation times of the individual intensity periods .",
    "this generalizes a similar result for a @xmath0 system in @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that the existence of extended dark periods may considerably enhance the amplitude of bloch oscillations .    as an application we have derived an expression for the intensity correlation function of two dipole - dipole interacting @xmath0 systems and",
    "have studied its behavior with respect to the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we have shown that there is a significant trace of the dipole - dipole interaction in @xmath1 for small @xmath2 which is particularly pronounced for small values of the strong driving .",
    "this effect of the dipole - dipole interaction should be experimentally verifiable for atomic distances of a few wavelength of the strong transitions . for two dipole - dipole interacting two - level systems",
    "the effect is about a factor of two smaller .",
