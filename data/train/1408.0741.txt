    "( amphiphilic bilayers ) and crystalline ( cytoskeleton ) properties , are a significant example @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interest in non - biological two - dimensional crystals has been renewed in recent years due to the discovery of graphene and similar materials with enormous potential technological applications @xcite . from both a theoretical and a phenomenological point of view ,",
    "it is of interest to investigate the phase - diagram of these structures to gain better knowledge of their behavior under thermal and mechanical stresses .    in a statistical mechanics framework",
    "the phase - diagram can be obtained assigning a microscopic ( bare ) hamiltonian to the membrane model and computing the corresponding free - energy via a path - integral formalism .",
    "the formalism allows to identify the critical points of the model , which separate the salient mechanical phases of the membrane . for the sake of this introduction",
    ", it is useful to consider the membrane as an effective description of a layer of fundamental constituents ( monomers ) linked together by a bonding interaction of fixed connectivity ( crystal ) .",
    "the phase - diagram of a theory of membranes is generally very complex because two - dimensional geometry allows for various definitions of local order with corresponding order - parameters .    in a continuous formulation",
    "the membrane is the image of a map @xmath0 where in the physically interesting case of a two - dimensional membrane embedded in three - dimensional space one has @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but for the sake of generality in most of this work we will leave the couple @xmath3 general . as a general requirement , we demand any membrane model to be invariant under the isometries of the embedding @xmath4 where @xmath5 is any @xmath6-dimensional rotation parametrized by some angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a general translation vector in @xmath9 .",
    "the continuous formulation is of course only an effective description of the fundamental monomers interactions .",
    "if @xmath10 is the typical intra - monomer length , the effective continuous description will generally work well for @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the inverse of the temperature in units of the boltzmann constant .",
    "in fact , the examples cited above are characterized by @xmath13 ( bilayers and graphene ) and @xmath14 ( cytoskeleton ) , and admit an accurate continuous description at the higher length scales of @xmath15 .",

    "ideally , at low temperatures the bindings are intact and the monomers are in their `` natural '' crystalline phase . in this phase",
    "the local connectivity is unaltered , thus the thermal fluctuations are elastic and can affect only the bindings lengths . at high temperatures the bindings melt and the membrane undergoes a fluid phase that is characterized by the absence of both local connectivity and order . in the intermediate temperatures phase ,",
    "the binding interactions are assumed to be relevant , but not dominant .",
    "the intermediate regime describes the melting and the local connectivity plays the role of the order parameter @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to show how to derive the three main effective models of the ktnhy description in a unified formalism by considering the breaking of the global symmetries of the embedding space @xmath9 due to the presence of the membrane @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we will use the formalism of the maurer - cartan form ( mcf ) which proves very efficient in the investigation of symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "the mcf formalism has the advantage of clearly identifying the order parameters of the broken symmetries through a coset construction .",
    "the order parameters obtained in this way thus enjoy a formal definition as outlined in @xcite .",

    "at high temperatures the bindings among the monomers melt , which are then free to diffuse along the membrane @xcite . at macroscopic equilibrium",

    "the components @xmath86 correspond to the broken normal translations . whenever translations are broken in a system the usual counting of the degrees of freedom of the goldstone theorem",

    "each specific coset was constructed using the very efficient formalism of the maurer - cartan form and is motivated by the physical properties that the fundamental constituents of the membrane are assumed to posses according to the temperature of the thermal bath .",
    "the inclusion of the physical properties of the constituents and of their crystalline structure is essential for reproducing all the distinct phases of the ktnhy description , therefore distinguishing our effective models of membranes from those in which the membrane is considered a fundamental object such as string theory @xcite .",
    "immediately identified in the effective description obtained through the maurer - cartan form are both the goldstone fields of the broken symmetries of embedding and the relevant order parameters for the phases of each model , which in these models have immediate physical interpretations @xcite . in all models , the order parameters obtained via the coset construction coincide with those that were already well - established in the literature @xcite , but within the coset construction they acquire a formal definition in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the construction of the ktnhy models shows clearly the degrees of freedom that have to be effectively integrated in the low- and intermediate - temperature regimes to obtain effective fluid descriptions for all of them .",
    "the effective integration of both the low - temperature crystalline phase and of the intermediate hexatic phase give effective fluid models that possess long range interactions among intrinsic curvatures on the membrane , which are believed to induce crinkled phases at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the crinkled phase is determined by the presence and interactions of intrinsic ripples of the surface characterizing the membrane @xcite . while the importance of role of long range interactions among displacements of the membrane is already well known for the characterization of the flat phase of a crystalline membrane @xcite , we showed how these effectively manifest in a fluid description and gave a clear geometrical interpretation .",
    "the long range interactions are induced by the thermal fluctuations , by the melting of the crystalline structure and by the loss of local order among the fundamental constituents .",
    "the sole presence of the long range interactions casts doubts on whether a crystalline and a fluid descriptions may share the same phase - diagram . for a physical two - dimensional membrane embedded in a three - dimensional space",
    "there is no conclusive proof whether the phase - diagram is shared or not .",
    "this work can be considered as a step forward in the direction of a better understanding of this question and a further indication that it has to be addressed non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "our results are especially relevant for the melting of both regular and unstructured two - dimensional crystals into a fluid phase .",
    "in such a scenario , the crystal undergoes a crinkled phase that is characterized by an anomalous fractal dimension of the membrane due to the presence of effective long range interactions among the monomers . in our computations ,",
    "the spectral dimension is a genuine prediction of the formalism when the crystal does not exhibit local order even in the crystalline phase , while it depends on the hexatic rigidity when local order is present .",
