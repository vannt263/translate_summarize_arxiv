    "interacting electron and spin models in two dimensions ( 2d ) exhibit some of the most interesting phenomena in condensed - matter physics , e.g. , superconductivity and topologically ordered spin - liquid phases .",

    "for example , exact diagonalization ( ed ) allows only for very limited system sizes , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite is extremely efficient in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems but becomes very challenging in higher dimensional systems , and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods @xcite suffer from the infamous sign problem in fermionic and frustrated systems . over the past years",
    ", the class of tensor - product states has been shown to be a very promising tool .",
    "most successful are matrix product states ( mps ) , @xcite which are the underlying base of the dmrg method , providing the most powerful tool to study 1d systems . various generalization of the mps approach to 2d have been proposed , including rather direct generalizations such as projected entangled pair states or tensor product states ( tps ) @xcite as well as correlator product states or entangled - plaquette states.@xcite tps - based algorithms have been successfully applied to various frustrated quantum spin systems and hard - core bosons in 2d @xcite .",
    "based on the concept of entanglement renormalization , the so - called tensor renormalization group ( trg ) and multi scale entanglement renormalization group ( mera ) methods have been developed and successfully applied to lattice systems.@xcite yet , due to the scaling of computational complexity as a function of the dimension of the tensors ( i.e. , the bond dimension ) , the applicability of the algorithms is still limited .",
    "this limitation motivates a search for alternative tensor - network - based algorithms .",
    "recently , variational monte carlo ( vmc ) methods have been proposed , improving a tensor - product state ( tps ) by stochastically applying projectors which filter out excited states.@xcite in an approach closely related to our work , wave functions combining a correlator product state and a slater determinant ( or a pfaffian ) were studied .",
    "@xcite hartree - fock and configurational interaction based input wave functions were also used to achieve better accuracy and lower the required bond dimension in the dmrg procedure .",
    "@xcite these results suggest that it is important to choose the basis wave functions that already represent some key features of the physics of the system under investigation .    in this paper , we propose a method which combines 2d tensor product states with standard trial wave functions .",
    "our study is a generalization of a recent work by chou _",
    "_ @xcite in which matrix - product based projected wave functions were considered as trial wave functions for vmc simulations in a 1d model .",
    "the main idea is that we can use physical intuition to choose an input wave function that already contains some of the features of the ground state which are difficult to be captured by a tps with small bond dimension .",
    "this way we can reduce the computational costs arising from the tensor contraction and still have a very good approximation of the ground - state wave function . furthermore , using the vmc method to sample energies , we ensure that we approach the ground - state energy from above .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking the ground - state energies and correlations for several 2d interacting quantum systems , such as spinless fermionic and hardcore bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 models , as well as the spinful fermionic hubbard model . in these quantum models ,",
    "we find that a suitable jastrow - type or hartree - fock wave function greatly helps the tps to approach the ground state .",

    "more generally , a representation of a quantum many - body state , which we call the tensor - product projected state ( tpps ) , can be written in terms of the projection operators acting on an input wave function @xmath9 : @xmath10}=\\hat{t}_{[i]}^{j_{i}}|j_{i}\\rangle\\langle j_{i}|$ ] .",
    "if we assume @xmath11 , i.e. , a wave function with equal probability distribution of all configurations ( a site - factorized state ) , we recover the tps wave function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tps ] ) . however , we can also choose a different trial state , which might be closer to the ground state of a given system ( e.g. , incorporate entanglement ) and thus require a smaller bond dimension of the tensor network.@xcite a schematic representation of the tpps wave function is shown in fig .",

    "the sr method is a projector based optimization using the hamiltonian to filter out the lowest energy state within the available subspace of the hilbert space .",

    ", both the elements of tensors and parameters of the trial wave function might be variationally optimized .",
    "more details about the sr method can be found in refs .  .",
    "the monte carlo sampling scheme ensures that the wave function is variational , and the energy fulfills the variational principle , i.e. , the approximated energy provides an upper bound for the exact energy .",
    "in contrast , this is not necessarily the case when the wave function is obtained using the simplified update and the tensor network is contracted approximately.@xcite      during the simulation , we need to evaluate the contribution from the tensor network to the weight .",

    ", however , the cost of contracting a tensor network with a given cutoff @xmath23 grows rapidly with @xmath5 , e.g. it takes almost 20 times longer to contract a @xmath5=3 than a @xmath5=2 tps with @xmath27 .",
    "it is thus important to start with a good trial wave function rather than to blindly increase the bond dimension of the tensors .",

    "we can lower the computational cost of tensor contraction by using part of the results from the previous step and updating only the elements that are changed at each stage of the coarse graining procedure.@xcite this way of updating elements is particularly helpful for larger lattice systems . in the following section ,",

    "<S> we propose an efficient numerical method , which combines the advantages of recently developed tensor - network based methods and standard trial wave functions , to study the ground state properties of quantum many - body systems . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , we apply a projector in the form of a tensor - product operator to an input wave function , such as a jastrow - type or hartree - fock wave function , and optimize the tensor elements via variational monte carlo . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement already contained in the input wave function can considerably reduce the bond dimensions compared to the regular tensor - product state representation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this allows us to also represent states that do not obey the area law of entanglement entropy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for fermionic systems , the fermion sign structure can be encoded in the input wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the optimized states provide good approximations of the ground - state energy and correlation functions in the cases of two - dimensional bosonic and fermonic systems . </S>"
