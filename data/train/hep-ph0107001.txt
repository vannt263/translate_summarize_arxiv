    "we show that the allowed operators in the effective theory reproduce the hard - collinear contribution in a simple way , and also extend the resulting convolution to include the short distance coefficient at an arbitrary order in perturbation theory .",

( [ phi2 ] )",
    "is not very useful .",
    "for instance , in loop integrals we will still need to perform the sum over the large @xmath76 momenta .",
    "the key observation is that after expanding , the remnant of gauge symmetry provides important restrictions on the allowed form of label changing operators .",
    "it is these restrictions that make the effective theory predictive , and determining the corresponding rules is the goal of this paper .",
    "to proceed , we make a brief diversion to define an operator @xmath1 which acts on products of effective theory fields .",
    "when acting on collinear fields , @xmath1 gives the sum of large labels on fields minus the sum of large labels on conjugate fields .",
    "thus , for any function @xmath77 @xmath78 the operator @xmath1 has mass dimension @xmath79 , but power counting dimension @xmath51 .",
    "the conjugate operator @xmath80 acts only to its left and gives the sum of labels on conjugate fields minus the sum of labels on fields . for convenience",
    "we also define an operator @xmath81 which produces the analogous sum of order @xmath14 labels , and we let @xmath82 .    the power counting for collinear quark fields is @xmath83 , while for collinear gluon fields @xmath84  @xcite . since @xmath85 an operator at",
    "a given order can contain any number of these gluons .",
    "the utility of @xmath86 is that even in an operator with an arbitrary number of fields the large phases can all be pulled to the front of the operator .",
    "this is because these phases can be commuted through derivatives , @xmath87 and the overall phase then simply enforces label conservation .",
    "the remaining derivatives on fields are order @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , using these operators we no longer need to write explicit sums over labels .",
    "since @xmath89 commutes with the sums , we can adopt a convention where all field labels are summed over , @xmath90 . for e.g. , @xmath91 .",
    "from now on labels are always summed over , unless otherwise stated .",
