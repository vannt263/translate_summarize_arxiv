    "among the several different efforts to describe out - of - equilibrium systems , the linear non - equilibrium thermodynamic approach  @xcite has obtained many important results , at least for a class of systems close to equilibrium . in this framework ,",
    "a fundamental role is played by the macroscopic entropy production , which is related to the irreversible phenomena occurring in the system due to the presence of heat and matter currents , chemical reactions , viscous flows , etc ... for systems in contact with a single thermal bath , the study of fluctuations relaxing towards the equilibrium state can be described within such a theory , and extensions of it  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the great interest in the study of entropy production in non - equilibrium stationary states has been motivated by the fact that , in some particular cases , it can be shown that the stationary state is characterized by the minimum entropy production principle  @xcite .    for generally far from equilibrium systems ,",
    "a comprehensive theory is still lacking , but some important results have been obtained in the last years . in particular , in the framework of systems described by stochastic models , a stochastic thermodynamics has been proposed , extending the concepts of standard thermodynamics to fluctuating quantities , and some general relations have been proved  @xcite . as for classical equilibrium thermodynamics , a central role",
    "is played by the microscopic , fluctuating version of entropy production , defined as functional of finite time - length trajectories in the phase space .",
    "such a quantity satisfies relations which have been considered by some authors as generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the specific aim of this paper is the study of fluctuations of entropy production in systems described by a set of coupled langevin equations .",
    "many examples of physical systems are well characterized by such a kind of stochastic process  @xcite . in particular , we are interested in non - equilibrium stationary systems where the coupling among the different fields defining the model , as well as the noise entering the langevin description , violate the detailed balance condition . in these out - of - equilibrium systems a finite rate of entropy production can be measured . however , from a microscopic point of view , fluctuating entropy production is an elusive quantity : in a non - equilibrium stationary state ( ness ) the total entropy @xmath0 ( assuming we have a definition for it ) has vanishing time - derivative . in analogy with the perspective of linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics , one can try to separate this zero time - derivative into two opposite contributions : one is a surface term , namely the entropy flow through the boundaries ( e.g. heat exchanged with the thermostat ) and the other is a bulk , volume term , namely the entropy produced inside the system because of internal lack of detailed balance : @xmath1 at equilibrium both terms are vanishing , but in a ness the production term is always positive . in linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "symmetry arguments contribute to make this separation unique ; however , in general , it is not evident that this unique separation can always be achieved .",
    "a definition of the entropy production term related to the dynamics rather than to the thermodynamics of the system has been proposed in recent years : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a functional of the trajectory @xmath4 of the system in the time interval @xmath5 $ ] , with @xmath6 a set of relevant observables . as will be also shown in sec .",

    "we bring to the fore the structural elements which are common to general systems of langevin equations . in particular , we relate the expressions obtained from the stochastic description of the system to macroscopic quantities , which can be put in a form very similar to that of linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics .    in order to illustrate our general results ,",

    "[ fluc ] we obtain an expression for the entropy production of a set of langevin equations , which is applied to fluctuating hydrodynamic equations for granular fluids in sec .  [ granular ] . finally , some conclusions are drawn in sec .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "two appendices are devoted to some technical details .",
    "here we recall some concepts of the linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics theory  @xcite , in order to give a reference frame for the following discussions .",
    "linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics is a continuum theory which aims at describing macroscopic systems characterized by irreversible processes .",
    "the starting point is the balance equation for the entropy , stating that the entropy in a volume changes because entropy flows from the boundaries into the volume , or because some irreversible phenomena are taking place inside the volume .",
    "the underlying hypothesis is a `` local '' equilibrium assumption , which allows one to write the thermodynamic gibbs relations connecting the local ( within a small mass element ) entropy with other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the first step of the theory is the local formulation of the conservation laws . in general , the conservation law for a given conserved quantity @xmath9 ( energy , mass , a component of momentum ) in the system reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the flux associated with @xmath9 . for an open system , in the presence of sources ( or sinks ) for the quantity @xmath9 , we write the balance equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the production ( or absorption ) of quantity @xmath9 in unit time .",
    "as mentioned above , the variation of entropy @xmath14 of a macroscopic system is described by a balance equation , namely it can be split in two contributions : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the entropy change due to the coupling of the system with the surrounding medium , and @xmath17 is the entropy produced inside the system due to irreversible processes . for an insulated system , @xmath18 and then @xmath19 , from the second law of thermodynamics . for closed systems exchanging heat @xmath20 with a thermostat at temperature @xmath21 ,",
    "one has @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the change in time of the total entropy @xmath14 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the contour surface of the system , @xmath26 is the entropy flow for unit time and unit area , @xmath27 is the entropy production density per unit time and @xmath28 the total volume . for open systems , @xmath26 is the sum of the heat flow divided by the local temperature , @xmath29 , plus all the flows of matters from the outside . using the conservation laws and `` local '' equilibrium hypothesis ,",
    "the entropy production can be related to the several different irreversible phenomena occurring inside the system .",
    "the structure of the entropy production @xmath27 is then that of a bilinear form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are fluxes ( or currents ) of the quantities describing the system , which are associated with irreversible phenomena , and @xmath32 are thermodynamic forces ( or affinities ) , related to gradients of state variables ( spatial non - homogeneities ) or to external forces . in equilibrium conditions ,",
    "all the thermodynamic forces vanish and so the entropy production does .",
    "moreover , one also requires that all fluxes vanish with the thermodynamic forces .",
    "let us consider for instance the case of a metal bar coupled at the edges with two thermostats at different temperatures  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , a stationary temperature profile sets up along the bar , with a surface entropy flux due to flux of heat across the edges and a bulk entropy production due to the sustain of a temperature gradient in the bulk :    @xmath33    where @xmath21 is the local temperature and the thermodynamic force conjugated to the heat flux is @xmath34 . from the entropy production in the bulk and the knowledge of the geometry of our problem the net flux of entropy across the edges",
    "can be then deduced . in sec .",
    "[ granular ] , we shall consider homogeneously driven granular systems in two dimensions , where such a simple distinction between surface and bulk contributions can not be carried out .      in order to close the system of equations for the entropy production",
    ", conservation laws and entropy balance equations have to be supplemented by the phenomenological relations , which , as first approximation , express the fluxes in terms of a linear combination of thermodynamic forces @xmath35 through the onsager coefficients @xmath36 . substituting such relations into the expression for entropy production , one obtains @xmath37 namely a quadratic expression in the thermodynamic forces . in equilibrium conditions ,",
    "the thermodynamic forces vanish and , due to eq .",
    "( [ it.5 ] ) , so the fluxes do .    in the physical example introduced above",
    ", the phenomenological relation is the fourier s law @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the heat conductivity , and @xmath40 if the forces @xmath41 perturb a system at equilibrium , i.e. a system where only conservative ( and therefore time - reversible ) forces are present , then onsager has shown that the coefficients @xmath36 satisfy the so - called reciprocal relations  @xcite .",
    "statistical systems are conveniently described by stochastic processes .",
    "we recall here how the notion of entropy production can be introduced in such a framework .",
    "in particular , here we focus on the degree of irreversibility of the dynamics , as measured by the functional @xmath42 introduced by lebowitz and spohn  @xcite , where @xmath43 is a trajectory of the phase space in the time interval @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a discrete time process , where jumps occur at times @xmath44 , with @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the functional @xmath42 is defined as the ratio between the probability of a given trajectory @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , and the probability of time - reversed trajectory @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , according to the parity of the field .    in a stationary state , where entropy produced / consumed inside the system is continuously balanced by a flux coming from the boundaries , as in eq .",
    "( [ it.3 ] ) @xmath53 we write , following  @xcite ,    @xmath54    the functional @xmath3 depends on a stochastic variable ( i.e. a trajectory of a stochastic differential equation ) and is itself a stochastic variable with a given probability density : indeed , for finite @xmath55 , it can also take negative values , of course with a probability decreasing with increasing @xmath55 . at large times and for bounded ( or negligible ) values of the term @xmath56 , the probability density of @xmath8",
    "satisfies the so - called fluctuation relation  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will show that , in cases which are relevant for non - equilibrium spatially extended systems , the functional  ( [ it.10b ] ) can take a clear thermodynamic meaning , since it can be expressed in terms of macroscopic currents and forces , in strict analogy with the form of entropy production  ( [ it.4 ] ) discussed in sec .",

    "we specialize to a continuous space and time markov process and , hereafter , @xmath57 denotes a complex @xmath58-dimensional vector , with components @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the time - reversal transformation on vector @xmath57 is defined as an operator which changes @xmath61 with @xmath62 : this implies that both real and imaginary parts of @xmath59 have the same sign - change upon time - reversal . as shorthand notations we will use @xmath63 or @xmath64 to indicate the vector made of time - reversed components @xmath65 . in a coarse - grained description of a fluid system , instances of even variables are the fourier components of local density and temperature fluctuations ( @xmath66 ) , whereas the velocity field is odd ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "( [ fw_eq ] ) is indeed a good model to describe the behavior of macroscopic variables in many contexts  @xcite .",
    "often it works as a first approximation , where one retains only the linear part of the dynamics and the effect of nonlinearities is replaced with noise terms .    in order to define a useful projection of the dynamics ,",
    "let us for the moment neglect the noise terms in eq .",
    "( [ fw_eq ] ) , namely @xmath76 .",
    "the time - reversal trajectory satisfies the following differential equation : @xmath77=-\\epsilon_i b_i[\\epsilon\\overline{\\phi(s)}].\\ ] ] we notice two particular cases for @xmath78 : @xmath79 in the first case @xmath80 satisfies exactly the forward equation  ( [ fw_eq ] ) . in the second case",
    "it satisfies the same equation with drift changed of sign . following these two limit cases , we will in general",

    "we assume that the system  ( [ fw_eq ] ) converges to a unique stationary state in the long time limit .",
