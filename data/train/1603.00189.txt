    "in the present article , we survey a recent chapter of representation theory of @xmath0-modules : the theory of kp modules .",
    "there is a really famous family of @xmath0-modules : these are demazure modules ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they are given by the spaces of sections of line bundles on the schubert varieties in flag manifolds .",
    "invented in the 1970s by demazure , the theory was developed in the 1980s by joseph , andersen , polo , mathieu , van der kallen et al .",
    "the origins of kp modules , though also related to schubert varieties , are different . in the beginning of 1980s ,",
    "lascoux and schtzenberger @xcite discovered schubert polynomials  certain polynomial lifts of cohomology classes of schubert varieties in flag manifolds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "schubert polynomials are described in sect .",
    "[ schub ] .",
    "it was a conjecture of lascoux ( oberwolfach , june 1983 ) that there should exist a functorial version of this construction ( similarly as to schur functions there correspond schur functors , cf .",
    "[ schur ] ) .",
    "the lascoux conjecture was solved affirmatively by krakiewicz and the author @xcite .",
    "the so - obtained modules were called _ krakiewicz - pragacz modules _ , in short _ kp modules _ by watanabe , who is the author of further developments of the theory of kp modules and kp filtrations in the spirit of the highest weight categories @xcite .",
    "his work @xcite is surveyed in sect .",
    "the kp modules and related modules , e.g. schur flagged modules , are discussed in sect .",
    "[ las ] .",
    "the last two sections are devoted to study positivity .    in section [ plet ] ,",
    "we discuss a recent result of watanabe , showing that a schur function specialized with the monomials @xmath1 of a schubert polynomial is a nonnegative combination of schubert polynomials in @xmath2 .",
    "the method relies on kp filtrations .    for a monomial @xmath3 ,",
    "set @xmath4 . in section [ ample ] ,",
    "we discuss a result of fulton from the 1990s , asserting that a schur function specialized with the expressions @xmath5 associated to the monomials @xmath6 of a schubert polynomial is a nonnegative combination of schubert polynomials in @xmath2 .",
    "the method relies on ample vector bundles .",
    "perhaps a couple of words about comparison of demazure and kp modules is in order .",
    "kp modules are in some way similar to demazure modules ( of type ( a ) ) , the modules generated by an extremal vector in an irreducible representation of @xmath7 : they are both cyclic @xmath0-modules parametrized by the weights of the generators , and if the permutation is vexillary , then the kp module coincides with demazure module with the same weight of the generator .",
    "if a permutation is not vexillary , then there exists a strict surjection from the kp module to the demazure module of the corresponding lowest weight .",

    "in his dissertation @xcite ( berlin , 1901 ) , schur gave a classification of irreducible polynomial representations of the full linear group @xmath9 , i.e. homomorphisms @xmath10 sending an @xmath11-matrix @xmath12 to an @xmath13-matrix @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is a polynomial in the entries of @xmath12 .",

    "then , using suitable derived functors ( following a method introduced in kempf s 1971 thesis ) , this allows one to describe syzygies of determinantal ideals @xcite . in fact , there is a natural extension of schur functors to schur complexes with many applications ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
