    "<S> the scale invariance at low energies is broken by the masses of the particles . however , at a scale much beyond the standard model ( sm ) the scale invariance is restored . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if there is a scale invariant sector , it can be experimentally probed at tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> recently georgi @xcite observed that such a conformal sector , due to the banks - zaks ( bz ) fields @xcite , with scale dimensions @xmath5 , might appear at the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> this sector at low energies he termed as `` unparticles '' ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , which are invisible massless particles . in high energy collider experiments , like the lhc or ilc , the missing energy distributions of various processes can serve as a good test for the existence of these unparticles .    </S>",

    "<S> the possible effects of the @xmath0 particle in the missing energy signatures of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and the monojet production at hadronic collisions were performed in reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that there has also been another recent study of unparticle physics within the context of b - decays @xcite , where the effects of @xmath0 in hadronic flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes was discussed . in another work the constraints on unparticle physics from electron ( g-2 ) to positronium </S>",

    "<S> we have tried to explore the phenomenology of an unparticle ( @xmath0 ) in the lepton flavour violating decay @xmath8 .    before commencing with the calculation a few words on this theory are in order . at very high energy </S>",
    "<S> the theory contains the sm fields and the fields of the scale invariant sector , called bz fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bz sector interacts with sm particles through the exchange of a connector sector which has an high mass scale @xmath9 . below this mass scale </S>",

    "<S> three unparticles operators with different lorentz structures ; @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are studied in reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scale invariance was used to fix the two point correlation functions of these unparticle operators . </S>",
    "<S> note that the abovementioned @xmath19 and @xmath20 were taken to be transverse . in reference </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the following set of effective operators , which can have interesting phenomenological implications , were given ; @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gluon field strength tensor , @xmath23 denotes sm fermions and @xmath24 are the dimensionless effective coupling constants with @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> note that where we have used @xmath26 we are referring to scalar , vector and tensor unparticle operators respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of these operators were further analyzed in references @xcite . in the analysis of unparticle physics in @xmath27 , by georgi @xcite , </S>",

    "<S> the scalar operator couples with ordinary sm fermions and in principle can contribute to the problem under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> however , their contributions are proportional to the fermion mass and are suppressed , as we have electrons ( positrons ) in the final state . for this reason we shall consider only the vector ( axial - vector ) unparticle operator in this paper .    the @xmath28 decay is described by the feynman diagrams presented in figure ( 1 ) . as such , in obtaining the matrix element for the @xmath29 decay we need to know the propagator of the vector unparticles . </S>",

    "<S> as we can observe from this figure the branching ratio is very sensitive to the scaling dimension of the unparticle ( @xmath5 ) . in figure ( [ fig:3 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we have shown the dependence of the branching ratio of @xmath59 on the various @xmath60 s , where the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 correspond to the lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) interactions . </S>",

    "<S> the same lfv couplings will be involved in other lfv processes , such as @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> it would , therefore , be interesting to explore the phenomenology of lfv unparticle operators on radiative lfv processes and their possible coorelation with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> it is very well known that susy predicts a very strong coorelation in the lfv processes @xmath63 and @xmath59 , where these coorelations tend to change substantially in the little higgs model with t - parity @xcite . as such </S>",
    "<S> , it would be interesting to study the coorelations amongst various lfv modes in the presence of a scale invariant sector / unparticles .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> unparticle physics due to conformal invariance , might appear at the tev scale and can lead to interesting phenomenological consequences which can be checked at low energy experiments . in this work we have studied the consequences of unparticle physics in the lepton flavour violating process @xmath1 and determined that the decay width is sensitive to the virtual effects of these unparticles . </S>"
