    "the number of fermion generations , which is associated to the number of light neutrinos , is one of the most important predictions of the standard model of the electroweak interactions ( sm ) @xcite . in the sm",
    "the decay width of the @xmath4 boson into each neutrino family is calculated to be @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "additional generations , or other new weakly interacting particles with masses below @xmath7 , would lead to a decay width of the @xmath4 into invisible channels larger than the sm prediction for three families while a smaller value could be produced , for example , by the presence of one or more right - handed neutrinos mixed with the left - handed ones @xcite .",
    "thus the number of light neutrino generations @xmath8 , defined as the ratio between the measured invisible decay width of the @xmath4 , @xmath9 , and the sm expectation @xmath10 for each neutrino family , need not be an integer number and has to be measured with the highest possible accuracy .",
    "the most precise measurement of the number of light @xmath11 active neutrino types , and therefore the number of associated fermion families , comes from the invisible @xmath4 width @xmath9 , obtained by subtracting the observed width into quarks and charged leptons from the total width obtained from the lineshape . the number of effective neutrinos @xmath8 is given by @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , the sm expression for the ratio of widths into a charged lepton and a single active neutrino , is introduced to reduce the model dependence .",
    "the experimental value from the four lep experiments is @xmath8= 2.9841@xmath140.0083 @xcite , excluding the possibility of a fourth family unless the neutrino is very heavy .",
    "this result is in agreement with cosmological constraints on the number of relativistic species around the time of big bang nucleosynthesis , which seems to indicate the existence of three very light neutrino species @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lep result is about two sigmas away from the sm expectation , @xmath8= 3 . while not statistically significant , this result suggests that the @xmath15-couplings might be suppressed with respect to the sm value @xcite .    using the experimental value for @xmath16 @xcite",
    ", we will determine the allowed region for @xmath8 as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the mixing angles between the light and the heavy neutral gauge bosons @xmath4 and @xmath19 of the lrsm @xcite and @xmath1 superstring models @xcite .",
    "in this way we will be able to get bounds on these mixing angles using the lep data on the number of light neutrino species .",
    "on the other hand , if one assumes that the results for @xmath9 and @xmath20 for a future tesla - like giga-@xmath4 experiment agree with the central values obtained at lep , one would get @xmath21 ( most conservative ) or @xmath22 ( most optimistic ) @xcite . in this case",
    "we estimate also a limit for these mixing angles .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we present the numerical computation and , finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "we will take advantage of our previous work on the lrsm @xcite and the @xmath1 superstring model @xcite and we will calculate the partial widths for @xmath23 and @xmath24 using the transition amplitudes given in eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 22 ) of ref . @xcite and the couplings of the two neutral gauge bosons involved in the @xmath1 model to fermions given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to compare the respective expressions with the experimental result for the number of light neutrinos species @xmath8",
    ", we will use the definition for @xmath8 in a sm analysis @xcite given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) and the lep result for the @xmath4 invisible width @xcite ,    @xmath25    this definition replaces the expression @xmath26 since ( 2 ) reduces the influence of the top quarks mass . to get information on the meaning of @xmath8 in the lrsm model",
    "we should define the corresponding expression @xcite ,    @xmath27    this new expression is a function of the mixing angle @xmath17 , and in this case the quantity defined as the number of light neutrinos species is not a constant and not necessarily an integer . also , @xmath28 in formula ( 3 ) is independent from the @xmath19 mass and therefore depends only of the mixing angle @xmath17 of the lrsm .",
    "experimental values for @xmath9 and for @xmath20 are reported in literature which , in our case , can give a bound for the angle @xmath17 .",
    "however , we can look to those experimental numbers in another way .",
    "the partial widths @xmath29 @xmath6 and @xmath30 @xmath6 were reported recently @xcite , but we use the value given by ( 3 ) for the @xmath31 rate of ref .",
    "all these measurements are independent of any model and can be fitted with the lrsm parameter @xmath28 in terms of @xmath17 .",
    "the same argument applies to the case of the @xmath1 superstring model and we will be able to get also a limit on its respective mixing angle @xmath18 between the light @xmath4 and heavy @xmath32 gauge bosons involved in this model @xcite .    in order to estimate a limit for the number of light neutrino species @xmath33 in the framework of a left - right symmetric model , we plot the expression ( 3 ) in fig .",
    "1 . in this figure",
    "we show the allowed region for @xmath33 as a function of @xmath17 with @xmath34 c.l .",
    "the allowed region is the inclined band that is a result of both factors in eq .",
    "( 3 ) . in this figure @xmath35",
    "gives the inclination while @xmath31 gives the broading .",
    "this analysis was done using the experimental value given in eq .",

    "we show the sm @xmath36 result at @xmath34 c.l . with the dashed horizontal lines .",
    "the allowed region in the lrsm ( dotted line ) for @xmath33 is wider that the one for the sm .",
    "if now we reverse the arguments , that is to say we fix the number of neutrinos in the lrsm to be three then the theoretical expression for @xmath37 will be given by    @xmath38    the plot of this quantity as function of the mixing angle @xmath17 is shows in fig .",
    "2 . the horizontal lines give the experimental region at @xmath39 c.l . from the figure we observe that the constraint for the angle @xmath17 is :    @xmath40    which is about one order of magnitude stronger than the one obtained in previous studies of the lrsm @xcite and it is consistent with our results obtained recently with the lep data obtained for the process @xmath41 @xcite .    in the case of a future tesla - like giga-@xmath4 experiment",
    "@xcite we obtain the following bounds for the mixing angle @xmath17 :    @xmath42    finally , in figs . 3 and 4 we present the respective plots for @xmath43 and @xmath44 as a function of @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", we get the following constraints on this mixing angle ,    @xmath45    if use is made of the lep results and    @xmath46    for the case of the expected parameters of the future tesla - like giga-@xmath4 experiment .",
    "the constraints obtain in the eqs .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) for the mixing angle @xmath18 are about one order of magnitude stronger than the one obtained in previous studies of the @xmath1 superstring models @xcite .",
    "we have determined a bound on the number of light neutrinos species in the frame work of a left - right symmetric model and a @xmath1 superstring model as a function of the mixing angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 . using these results and the lep values obtained for @xmath8",
    ", we were able to put limits on the lrsm and @xmath1 superstring mixing angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 which are stronger than those obtained in previous studies of these models .",
    "if new precision measurements find small deviations from three for @xmath8 , these models may explain these deviations with small values of their mixing angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we have found that the new data on @xmath47 can shrink appreciably the allowed regions for @xmath8 in the lrsm and the @xmath1 superstring model .",
    "as expected , in the limit of vanishing @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath48 we recover the bound on @xmath8 for the sm previously obtained in the literature @xcite ."
