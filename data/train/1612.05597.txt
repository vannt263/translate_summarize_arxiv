    "one - dimensional systems remain a fascinating field in condensed - matter physics since they constitute prime examples for the breakdown of fermi - liquid theory , which has to be replaced by the luttinger - liquid paradigm.@xcite arguably the most dramatic consequence of this is the absence of electron - like quasiparticles , manifesting itself in the separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom visible for example in angle - resolved photoemission,@xcite transport,@xcite scanning tunneling spectroscopy@xcite or resonant inelastic x - ray scattering@xcite experiments as well as analytical@xcite and numerical studies of several one - dimensional models.@xcite    the spectral properties of one - dimensional electron systems have been intensively investigated in the past .",
    "these works considered the gapless luttinger liquid,@xcite gapped systems like mott insulators or charge - density wave states,@xcite luttinger liquids with impurities,@xcite corrections to the luttinger model due to non - linear dispersions@xcite or the momentum dependence of the two - particle interaction,@xcite as well as additional phonon degrees of freedom.@xcite these investigations uncovered universal power - law behaviour at low energies as well as deviations thereof , spin - charge separation visible in the propagation modes , and signatures of these features in various experimental probes .    in this article",
    "we consider another situation , namely the microscopic study of the boundary effects on one - dimensional mott insulators .",
    "specifically we numerically study the local density of states ( ldos ) of one - dimensional hubbard models with open , ie , hard - wall , boundary conditions , where the system is at half filling and thus in its mott phase .",
    "a previous field - theoretical analysis@xcite has shown that the fourier transform of the ldos@xcite exhibits clear signatures of propagating spin and charge degrees of freedom , thus providing a way to detect spin - charge separation .",
    "furthermore , an additional boundary potential may lead to the formation of a boundary bound state , which manifests itself as a non - dispersing feature in the ldos .",
    "the aim of our work is to calculate the fourier transform of the ldos directly in the microscopic lattice model using a multi - target@xcite variant of the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) method @xcite employing an expansion in chebyshev polynomials .",
    "we find our numerical results to be fully consistent with the analytical predictions both qualitatively , ie , concerning the number of dispersion modes and their basic properties , as well as quantitatively with respect to the numerical values of the effective parameters like the mott gap and spin and charge velocities as compared to the exact results obtained from the bethe ansatz.@xcite thus our work provides a microscopic calculation of the fourier transform of the ldos in a gapped , strongly correlated electron system , showing spin - charge separation as well as the formation of a boundary bound state .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the microscopic models to be analysed and discuss the basic setup . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we give a brief summary of the numerical method we employ to calculate the single - particle green function .",
    "our results for the ldos of the mott insulators with open boundary conditions are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ldos ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bbs ] we study the effect of a boundary potential on the ldos , in particular we analyse the properties of the boundary bound state existing for sufficiently strong boundary potentials . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarise our results .",
    "in this work we analyse the ldos of the one - dimensional hubbard model  @xcite at half filling .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the annihilation and creation operators for electrons with spin @xmath3 at lattice site @xmath4 and @xmath5 the corresponding density operators .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 describe the hopping and repulsive on - site interaction respectively .",
    "furthermore we consider a chain with @xmath8 sites and open boundary conditions .",
    "since the system is assumed to be at half filling , the fermi momentum is given by @xmath9 .    as is well known,@xcite in the hubbard model at half filling , ie ,",
    "when there are @xmath8 electrons in the system , the repulsive interaction opens a gap in the charge sector and the system becomes a mott insulator .",
    "using bosonisation the low - energy behaviour of the system is described by the massive thirring model;@xcite the ldos of which in the presence of boundaries has been analysed in refs .  .",
    "the main objective of our article is the comparison of the ldos of the hubbard model with the field - theoretical results obtained in the thirring model .",
    "hereby the effective parameters in the field theory , ie , the mass gap and velocities , can be obtained from the exact bethe - ansatz solution of the hubbard model .",
    "this allows us to choose the microscopic parameters such that the expected features of the fourier transformed ldos can be easily resolved in the numerical results .",
    "in addition to the standard hubbard model we also consider its extension including a nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath10 , ie , the hamiltonian is given by@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total electron density .",
    "the low - energy regime of the extended hubbard model is still described  @xcite by the massive thirring model . however , since is no longer integrable , the explicit relation between the microscopic parameters @xmath6 , @xmath13 and @xmath10 and the field - theory ones is not known .",
    "thus the investigation of the phase diagram of the extended hubbard model at half filling had to be performed by numerical means.@xcite using these results we choose the microscopic parameters such that the system is well inside the mott - insulating phase with an energy gap @xmath14 so that we are able to clearly resolve the interesting features in our numerical results .",
    "in order to determine the ldos we calculate the retarded green function in frequency space using an expansion of the occurring resolvent in chebyshev polynomials.@xcite an alternative numerical approach consists in the expansion of the lehmann representation of the spectral function in chebyshev polynomials , the kernel polynomial method ( kpm ) , see refs .  .",
    "in contrast we specifically evaluate the complete ( real and imaginary part ) green functions @xmath15 with @xmath16 here @xmath17 denotes the ground state of the system with energy @xmath18 .",
    "note that since we are interested in the ldos we have already taken the electron creation and annihilation operators to be at the same site @xmath19 with @xmath20 denoting the lattice spacing .",
    "furthermore , since the systems we consider possess spin - rotation invariance we have suppressed the formal spin dependence of the green functions .    in eqs .   and",
    "we have included the convergence factor @xmath21 , which in the continuum limit should be taken as @xmath22 . in the numerical evaluations it has to be larger than the finite level splitting brought about by the finite system size . at the same time",
    "@xmath21 has to be smaller than any physically relevant energy scale in order to resolve the relevant features of the spectrum . to attain a small value of @xmath21",
    "we employ a chebyshev polynomial expansion approach for the resolvents in   and  .",
    "more details on this approach can be found in refs .  .",
    "the applied chebyshev expansion is based on the representation of the functions @xmath23 in terms of chebyshev polynomials @xmath24 the expansion coefficients are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a function of the artificial broadening @xmath21 which would theoretically allow arbitrarily small @xmath21 .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials @xmath27 are defined by their recursion relation @xmath28 and fulfil @xmath29 as well as @xmath30 in order to apply the expansion , which is only valid for @xmath31 , to the resolvents appearing in the green functions , we first have to rescale the energies . to this end",
    "we run initial dmrg calculations to determine the ground - state energy @xmath18 as well as the smallest and the largest energies of the system with @xmath32 electrons .",
    "this allows us to find the scaling factor @xmath33 and shift @xmath34 such that the operator @xmath35 has a spectrum between @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the sectors with @xmath32 particles .",

    "the moments @xmath45 are calculated iteratively from  using dmrg . during the dmrg finite - lattice sweeps we determine each state @xmath46 and include it into a modified density matrix . by performing a singular - value decomposition of this modified density matrix",
    "we ensure that all the states @xmath46 are part of the hilbert space after the dmrg truncation . the moments for @xmath47",
    "are then obtained employing and as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "finally , we note that the chebyshev moments @xmath45 are typically strongly oscillating with respect to the index @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the final results oscillate slightly when changing the value of @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "we find small oscillating parts in the spectral function if we choose @xmath51 too small . both effects can be avoided by implementing a smoothing window for the last @xmath52 moments . throughout this article",
    "we use a @xmath53-filter for the last @xmath54 moments .",
    "this way one can obtain a good approximation for the spectral function using a smaller number of moments @xmath51 . previously it was observed@xcite that the number of required chebyshev moments sufficient to approximate the green function is inversely proportional to the width of the spectrum @xmath33 and the desired artificial broadening @xmath21 , ie , @xmath55 . throughout this work use @xmath56 chebyshev moments for the series expansion of the green function .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 is chosen such that the resulting curves become smooth and artificial features are suppressed .",
    "the ldos is obtained from the retarded green function in the usual way . as was noted by kivelson et al.@xcite in the study of luttinger liquids with boundaries , it is useful to consider the fourier transform of the ldos , as physical properties like the dispersions of propagating quasiparticles can be more easily identified .",

    "we note that the ldos is directly related to the tunneling current measured in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments , thus its fourier transform is experimentally accessible . in the following we focus on the ldos for positive energies",
    "; the ldos for negative energies can be analysed analogously .",
    "the ldos of the low - energy effective field theory of the hubbard models and has been analysed@xcite in refs .  .",
    "in the field - theoretical description the momentum regimes @xmath61 and @xmath62 are treated separately . for small momenta @xmath61 the main features of the fourier transform are a strong divergence at @xmath63 as well as a propagating excitation in the gapped charge sector above the mott gap . in contrast , the behaviour at momenta @xmath64 shows a divergence at @xmath65 , a propagating excitation in the charge sector as well as a linearly dispersing excitation in the gapless spin sector . furthermore there exists a critical momentum",
    "above which a second linearly dispersing mode becomes visible .",
    "in addition , it was shown that certain boundary conditions lead to the formation of boundary bound states which manifest themselves as non - propagating features in the ldos .",
    "the main aim of our article is the calculation of the fourier transform of the ldos in the microscopic models and and its comparison to the field - theoretical predictions.@xcite we start with the standard hubbard chain before considering the extended version . in sec .",

    "the observed energy gap @xmath73 agrees perfectly with the value @xmath87 obtained from the bethe ansatz in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this suggests that the length of our chain is long enough to avoid significant finite - size effects in our results .",
    "the fourier transform of the ldos for small momenta is dominated by a global maximum at @xmath88 .",
    "this peak is attributed to a spin - density wave pinned at the boundary , it is also well visible in the field - theoretical results.@xcite at low energies above the energy gap we further observe a dispersing feature indicated by the arrow .",
    "this again agrees well with the results from the field theory that predict a gapped , dispersing charge excitation with dispersion relation @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath72 is the velocity of the charge excitations .",
    "the bethe - ansatz solution gives the value @xmath91 , which is in excellent agreement with the velocity observed in the plot .",
    "the physical origin of this dispersing feature is the decay of the electronic excitation into gapped charge and gapless spin excitations . in the process giving rise to the external momentum @xmath92 is taken by the charge excitation propagating through the system and eventually getting reflected at the boundary , while the spin excitation does not propagate and thus possesses zero momentum .",
    "the appearance of @xmath93 in originates from the fact that the charge excitation has to propagate to the boundary and back , thus covering the distance @xmath94 .",
    "in addition , we find a second dispersing feature that seemingly follows the same dispersion relation albeit with a different value for the gap @xmath95 .",
    "this feature is not contained in the field - theory description of the ldos , which solely focuses on the low - energy regime .",
    "furthermore , the field theory makes predictions about the power - law decay of @xmath81 at @xmath63 which , however , can not be resolved in our numerical data . for the observation of such features",
    "we would require a significantly higher resolution , both in energy and momentum .",

    "<S> we numerically calculate the local density of states ( ldos ) of a one - dimensional mott insulator with open boundaries , which is modelled microscopically by a ( extended ) hubbard chain at half filling . in the fourier transform of the ldos we identify several dispersing features corresponding to propagating charge and spin degrees of freedom , thus providing a visualisation of the spin - charge separation in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the effect of an additional boundary potential , which , if sufficiently strong , leads to the formation of a boundary bound state which is clearly visible in the ldos as a non - dispersing feature inside the mott gap . </S>"
