    "the nature of the wireless medium makes wireless communication systems inherently vulnerable for eavesdropping . in this context , the concept of information theoretic security is instrumental since it solely uses the physical properties of the wireless channel in order to establish security .",
    "information theoretic security was initiated by shannon @xcite and studied later by wyner , who introduced the now - popular _ wiretap channel _",
    "@xcite modeling the simplest scenario involving security with one legitimate transmitter - receiver pair and one wiretapper ( eavesdropper ) to be kept secret .",
    "there is currently a growing interest in information theoretic security , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "since spatial multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques can improve the performance significantly @xcite , mimo architectures have been identified as indispensable for future wireless systems .",
    "accordingly , investigation of information theoretic security for mimo systems is becoming more and more attractive .",
    "the secrecy capacity of the gaussian mimo wiretap channel is established in @xcite under full channel state information ( csi ) , where it turns out that gaussian signaling is optimal .",
    "subsequently , the optimal transmit covariance matrix has then been found under the matrix power constraint in @xcite and under the total power constraint for a number of special cases @xcite .    due to the dynamic nature of the wireless medium , but also due to implementation issues , practical systems always suffer from channel uncertainty and estimation / feedback inaccuracy .",
    "thus , the provision of accurate channel state information to the transmitter is a major challenge for wireless communication systems .",
    "along with this , it is hardly possible to expect that the eavesdropper will share its channel with the transmitter to make the eavesdropping harder , which makes the perfect eavesdropper csi model more than questionable . a reasonable and well - accepted approach to this problem is to assume that the exact channel realization is not known ; it is only known that it remains fixed during the entire transmission and that it belongs to a known set of channels ( uncertainty set ) , which results in the concept of _ compound channels _",

    "the discrete memoryless compound wiretap channel with a countably - finite uncertainty set ( i.e. finite - state channels ) is studied in @xcite .",
    "its secrecy capacity is established under the degradedness assumption , where all possible realizations of the eavesdropper channel must be degraded with respect to all possible realizations of the legitimate channel .",
    "when this condition is not satisfied , only an achievable secrecy rate is given while the secrecy capacity for the general case remains unknown .",
    "the corresponding compound gaussian mimo wiretap channel with countably - finite uncertainty sets is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "similarly to the discrete memoryless case , its secrecy capacity is established , again , only under the degradedness assumption .",
    "when the channel is not degraded , the secrecy capacity itself remains unknown and only an achievable secrecy rate is obtained . in @xcite , the special case of compound wiretap channels with two possible channel states for the legitimate receiver and known eavesdropper channel is studied .",
    "its secrecy capacity is established under the degradedness assumption and an achievable rate is given in the general ( non - degraded ) case while the capacity is unknown .",
    "interference alignment for the compound gaussian mimo wiretap channel is explored in @xcite .",
    "a gaussian mimo wiretap channel where the noiseless eavesdropper channel is arbitrarily varying is considered in @xcite . its achievable secrecy rate ( i.e. lower bound to the secrecy capacity ) is given and the secrecy degrees of freedom are established , while its capacity remains unknown . since degrees of freedom require @xmath0 , it is not clear what finite - snr implications are .",
    "the discrete memoryless compound broadcast channel with confidential messages is studied in @xcite and its strong secrecy capacity region is established in a multi - letter form .",
    "the corresponding gaussian mimo broadcast channel is considered in @xcite and its achievable degree - of - freedom region is established , but not the capacity region itself .    in all the previous studies ,",
    "the compound secrecy capacity has been established only for the special case of degraded channels with countably - finite uncertainty sets @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it is not clear if these results hold for more general ( e.g. uncountable ) or arbitrary uncertainty sets as well or how these results extend to non - degraded channels . for such non - degraded channels ,",
    "only an achievable secrecy rate is obtained with the consequence that it is not clear how far away this rate is from its actual capacity .",
    "the achievable secrecy rate is studied from a worst - case secrecy rate maximization point of view in @xcite .",
    "another approach is taken in @xcite by studying the behavior for @xmath0 .",
    "however , this does not provide any insights on the secrecy capacity or its behavior for the practical relevant case of finite @xmath1 .    in this paper , we address all these limitations and establish the ( strong ) secrecy capacity of compound gaussian mimo channels for a broad class of uncertainty sets ( not only finite or countable ) and without the degradedness assumption .",
    "we make use of the compound wiretap model , where the legitimate channel is perfectly known and the eavesdropper channel is not known to the transmitter but is known to have a bounded spectral norm ( maximum channel gain ) , both being fixed during the whole transmission duration .",
    "this represents a quasi - static scenario where the eavesdropper can not approach the transmitter closer than a certain protection distance so that its channel gain is bounded ( due to the propagation path loss ) but is unconstrained otherwise .",
    "this automatically implies only a minimal eavesdropper csi at the transmitter , which reflects well the natural eavesdropper desire to be confidential and its lack of cooperation . throughout the paper , full csi at the eavesdropper",
    "is assumed ( the safest assumption from the secrecy perspective ) .",
    "we make no assumptions of degradedness . the eavesdropper channel uncertainty scenario is further extended to the case where the legitimate channel is also allowed to have ( additive ) uncertainty , which represents channel estimation and feedback link limitations , and to the case of more general eavesdropper uncertainty sets , which may be non - isotropic .",
    "the compound secrecy capacity is established in two main steps .",
    "first , we consider the corresponding discrete memoryless ( dmc ) channel in section [ sec : dmc ] .",
    "for this channel model , an achievable ( strong ) secrecy rate was obtained in @xcite for countably - finite uncertainty sets . building on this result",
    ", we establish a lower bound for the compound ( strong ) secrecy capacity under arbitrary uncertainty sets ( not necessarily finite or countable ) in theorem [ the : arbitrary ] , which is subsequently extended to continuous alphabets in theorem  [ the : continuous ] using the set partitioning ( quantization ) arguments adopted to compound channels in  @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which these bounds are tight are given , thus establishing the secrecy capacity .",
    "under the saddle - point condition , the compound secrecy capacity is shown to be equal to that of the worst - case channel ( so that any code designed for the worst - case channel also works on the entire class of channels in the uncertainty set ) .",
    "secondly , the ( strong ) secrecy capacity of the compound gaussian mimo channel is established in theorem [ thm.m1 ] for the eavesdropper uncertainty with bounded spectral norm and without the degradedness assumption .",
    "this is done by establishing first an achievable rate of this channel in corollary [ cor : mimo ] .",
    "then , in section [ sec : uncert ] , the worst - case secrecy capacity ( i.e. the capacity of the worst - case channel in the set ) is obtained and the saddle - point property is established in the form @xmath2 , where the maximization is over the transmit covariance and minimization is over the eavesdropper channel uncertainty .",
    "the saddle - point property has the well - known game - theoretic interpretation : the mini - max zero - sum game is between the transmitter ( who controls the transmitted signal distribution ) and the eavesdropper ( who controls the channel ) ; neither player can deviate from an optimal strategy without incurring penalty provided the other player follows it .    combining all these",
    ", we establish the secrecy capacity of the compound gaussian mimo channel in a closed - form , which also equals the worst - case capacity , so that a code designed for the worst - case channel works over the whole class of channels as well .",
    "the optimal signaling is gaussian and on the eigenvectors of the legitimate channel , with power allocation somewhat similar but not identical to the regular water - filling .",
    "the worst - case eavesdropper is isotropic with the maximum allowed channel gain .",
    "this result is then extended to a broader class of compound channels , where the uncertainty set is only required to have a dominant ( maximum / maximal ) element and may be non - isotropic .",
    "it is shown that the existence of a maximum element in the eavesdropper uncertainty set is sufficient for a saddle - point to exist , so that the compound capacity equals the worst - case one and signaling on the worst - case channel achieves the capacity of the whole class of channels .",
    "the high / low snr regimes are considered and the condition for beamforming optimality is given .",
    "when the eavesdropper uncertainty is sufficiently large , beamforming is optimal at any snr .",
    "the case of rank - constrained eavesdropper is considered , motivated by the scenario where the transmitter is a base station with a large number of antennas while the receiver / eavesdropper are handsets with a small number of antennas . under this non - convex constraint ( in addition to the convex spectral norm constraint ) , there is no maximum element in the uncertainty set , yet the saddle - point property is shown to hold and the compound secrecy capacity is established .",
    "subsequently , a more general case of two - sided channel uncertainty is studied in section [ sec : double - sided ] , where the legitimate channel is also allowed to have ( additive ) uncertainty .",
    "this reflects the assumption that the legitimate receiver will share its csi with the transmitter , but limitations in feedback link and channel estimation result in channel uncertainty .",
    "the corresponding compound secrecy capacity is established and shown to be equal to the secrecy capacity of the worst - case channel in the uncertainty set , so that the saddle - point property still holds .",
    "the optimal signaling is still on the eigenmodes of the legitimate channel and the worst - case eavesdropper is isotropic .    while it was established in @xcite that the strong and weak secrecy capacities are the same for regular ( non - compound or known ) channels , section [ sec : weak vs. strong ] demonstrates that the same holds for compound channels if the saddle - point property holds under strong secrecy .    finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .    _",

    "here we consider the case where both the legitimate and eavesdropper channels are uncertain .",
    "the compound channel model follows the model in where :    [ eq.m4 ] @xmath373    where @xmath374 is the nominal part of @xmath207 known to the transmitter , and @xmath375 is the uncertain , unknown part ; @xmath376 is the spectral norm of @xmath377 , i.e. the largest singular value @xmath378 .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath214 follows the same model as in .",
    "this compound model reflects two important points :    1 .   the desire of the eavesdropper to be confidential to keep its spying abilities uncompromised , so it does not share its channel with the transmitter and therefore only minimal information about @xmath208 is available to the latter .",
    "2 .   the legitimate receiver , on the other hand , wishes to maximize the rate so it shares its channel with the transmitter .",
    "its channel uncertainty is due to the limitations of the feedback and estimation procedure , which is normally much smaller than that of the eavesdropper ( and hence the known nominal part ) .",
    "the secrecy capacity of this compound channel can be characterized as follows . for this purpose",

    "then , the compound secrecy capacity @xmath79 is @xmath381 i.e. , the worst - case secrecy capacity @xmath166 is also the ( compound ) secrecy capacity @xmath79 of the class of channels and gaussian signaling is optimal .",
    "the saddle - point property holds , @xmath382 where @xmath383 is the saddle - point .",
    "the worst - case channel is @xmath384 where @xmath385 are unitary matrices of right and left singular vectors of the nominal channel @xmath374 and @xmath386 is the diagonal matrix of its singular values .",
    "the optimal covariance @xmath387 is as in theorem [ thm.m1 ] with the substitution @xmath388 i.e. , the optimal signaling is on the eigenmodes of the degraded nominal channel @xmath389 and isotropic eavesdropper .",
    "the proof can be found in appendix [ app : thm.m2 ] .",
    "note that this theorem does not require the compound channel to be degraded .",
    "remarkably , the saddle - point property still holds and the isotropic eavesdropper ( of the maximum gain ) is still the worst - case one , even under the legitimate channel uncertainty , and the optimal signaling is almost the same as in theorem [ thm.m1 ] ( gaussian signaling is still optimal ) , with the legitimate channel substituted by its degraded ( due to uncertainty ) version . we observe that , as the uncertainty ( i.e. @xmath390 and/or @xmath248 ) increases , fewer and fewer eigenmodes are used until only the strongest one remains active , in which case the beamforming is optimal ( see ) .",
    "from this perspective , beamforming is the most robust strategy .",
    "the game - theoretic interpretation of the inequalities in is the same as for the single - sided uncertainty : @xmath391 is a saddle - point in the matrix game between the transmitter on one side and the eavesdropper and nature on the other ; neither can deviate from the optimal strategy without incurring penalty provided that the other player follows the strategy .      using similar arguments , theorem [ thm.m2 ] can be extended to the rank - constrained eavesdropper channel ,    [ eq.m6.2.1 ] @xmath392    where the eavesdropper rank is constrained by @xmath393 ( due to e.g. limited number of antennas ) .",

    "the proof can be found in appendix [ app : thm.m6.2 ] .",
    "the results above have been established under the strong secrecy condition .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that , for regular ( single - state or known ) channels , strong and weak secrecy capacities are the same .",

    "indeed , under the saddle point property , [ eq.cweak=cstrong proof ] c_w = c_c^strong c_c^weak c_w from which follows , where we have used the fact that the worst - case capacity is the same under the strong and weak secrecies , and that the strong compound secrecy capacity is not larger than the weak one .",
    "in particular , the results in theorems 4 , 5 and proposition 5 also hold under weak secrecy , so that one can go from weak to strong secrecy for free in the compound settings as well under the saddle - point property .",
    "in fact , the chain argument in has the following implications :    * the saddle point under strong secrecy ( @xmath404 ) implies a saddle point under weak secrecy ( @xmath405 ) , * no saddle point under weak secrecy ( @xmath406 ) implies no saddle point under strong secrecy ( @xmath407 ) .",

    "based on this , the ( strong ) secrecy capacity of the compound gaussian mimo wiretap channel has been established under the spectral norm constraint on the eavesdropper channel .",
    "the channel is not required to be degraded .",
    "the optimal signaling as well as the secrecy capacity are given in a closed form .",

    "the results are extended to non - isotropic uncertainty sets .",
    "it is shown that the existence of a maximum element in the uncertainty set is sufficient for a saddle - point to exist , so that compound capacity equals to the worst - case one and signaling on the worst - case channel achieves the capacity of the whole class of channels .",
    "finally , these results are extended to include the legitimate channel uncertainty .",
    "while the results above have been established under the total power constraint @xmath408 , using similar reasoning it can be shown that the same result holds under a general power constraint of the form @xmath409 , where @xmath410 is a unitary invariant set of positive semi - definite matrices , i.e. @xmath409 implies @xmath411 for any unitary @xmath412 .",
    "this constraint limits possible eigenvalues of @xmath228 but does not constrain in any way its eigenvectors .",
    "special cases include the total and maximum per - eigenmode power constraints ( either alone or in combination with each other ) .",
