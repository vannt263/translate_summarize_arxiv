    "the discovery of neutrino oscillation  @xcite indicates that neutrinos have finite masses and mix one another with near bimaximal lepton mixings in contrast to small quark mixings . in order to explain the large lepton mixings and small quark mixings , mass matrix models with various structures such as zero texture  @xcite@xcite , flavor @xmath1 symmetry  @xcite @xcite etc .",
    "have been investigated in the literature .",
    "we think that quarks and leptons should be unified .",
    "therefore , it is an interesting approach to investigate a possibility that all the mass matrices of the quarks and leptons have the same form which can lead to the large lepton mixings and the small quark mixings simultaneously . since the mass matrix model is intended to be embedded into a grand unified theory ( gut ) , it is desirable for the model to have the following features : ( i ) the structure is common to all the mass matrices , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for up quarks ( @xmath6 ) , down quarks ( @xmath7 ) , charged leptons ( @xmath8 ) , and neutrinos ( @xmath9 ) , respectively .",
    "( ii ) since we assume the seesaw mechanism  @xcite for neutrino masses , the structure should conserve its form through the relation @xmath10 .",
    "we shall call this structure as a seesaw - invariant form . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the dirac and the right - handed majorana type neutrino mass matrices , which are also assumed to have the same structure .    in this paper , as typical mass matrices which have the features mentioned above , we reconsider hermitian mass matrices @xmath13 for @xmath14 and symmetric mass matrices @xmath13 for @xmath15 with a universal form given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a diagonal phase matrix given by @xmath18 and the matrix @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 for @xmath21 . in this seesaw - invariant type of four - zero - texture model , we have four real component parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 in @xmath19 and phase parameters @xmath26 in @xmath17 .",
    "if we fix three eigenvalues @xmath27 of @xmath19 by the observed fermion masses , one free parameter is left in @xmath19 .",
    "so we shall choose @xmath25 as the free parameter in this paper .",
    "then we shall present analytical expressions for the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix  @xcite and the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) lepton mixing matrix  @xcite of the model in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath25 and @xmath31 .    by taking a special value for this free parameter as @xmath32 , the model with the same structure",
    "has been discussed in ref .",
    "however , in this special choice , the model predicts a rather smaller value for ( 1,3 ) element of the ckm quark mixing matrix than the corresponding observed experimental data . in order to overcome this defect in the quark sector ,",
    "we treat @xmath25 as a free parameter in the present paper and show that the observed small ckm quark mixings as well as large mns lepton mixings can be well derived by fine tuning of the free parameters .",
    "it has been claimed  @xcite that four - zero - texture models for quarks are ruled out at the three @xmath33 level from the experimental data for sin@xmath34 .",
    "however , we shall show from an analysis with use of the free parameter @xmath25 that the quark mixing angles and @xmath35 violating phase @xmath36 in our model are consistent with the data at one @xmath33 level , so that the sin@xmath34 is also consistent at the same level .",

    "the analytical expressions of the quark mixing matrix of the model are given in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , the lepton mixing matrix of the model is given .",
    "vi is devoted to a summary .",
    "we now discuss a diagonalization of the mass matrix @xmath13 .",

    "therefore we choose @xmath25 as the free parameter .",
    "then , we derive explicit expressions of the orthogonal matrix @xmath38 in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath25 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 are defined by @xmath43 the expressions of the components @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath25 are presented as @xmath44 from the condition that @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are real , we have the allowed region of @xmath25 given by @xmath45 the cases in which @xmath46 or @xmath47 are not allowed .",
    "we also have the following sign assignments for the eigenmass @xmath40 : @xmath48 namely @xmath29 should be taken negative while @xmath28 and @xmath30 are positive for the case in which @xmath49 . on the other hand , @xmath28 should be taken negative while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are positive for @xmath50 .",
    "we present approximated expressions of the orthogonal matrix @xmath38 for the normal hierarchy , inverse hierarchy , and quasi degenerate cases for the masses @xmath40 . here",
    "we introduce a @xmath51 parameter , instead of using @xmath25 , defined by @xmath52 the approximated expressions are obtained as follows :    case ( a ) : for @xmath53 ( normal hierarchy 1 ) , we have @xmath54    case ( b ) : for @xmath55 ( normal hierarchy 2 ) , we have @xmath56    case ( c ) : for @xmath57 ( inverse hierarchy ) , we have @xmath58    case ( d ) : for @xmath59 ( quasi degenerate 1 ) , we have @xmath60    case ( e ) : for @xmath61 ( quasi degenerate 2 ) , we have @xmath62 the inverse hierarchy and the quasi degenerate scenarios are unfavorable in our model .",

    "<S> we reconsider an universal mass matrix model which has a seesaw - invariant structure with four - zero texture common to all quarks and leptons . the ckm quark and mns lepton mixing matrices of the model </S>",
    "<S> are analyzed analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the model can be consistent with all the experimental data of neutrino oscillation and quark mixings by tuning free parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the model predicts a relatively large value for ( 1,3 ) element of the mns lepton mixing matrix , @xmath0 . using the seesaw mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , we also discuss the conditions for the components of the dirac and the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrices which lead to the neutrino mass matrix consistent with the experimental data . </S>"
