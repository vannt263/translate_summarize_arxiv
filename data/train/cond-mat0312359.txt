    "in spite of their highly idealized character , ` sticky hard sphere ' ( shs ) models continue to attract considerable attention in the recent literature on mesoscopic fluids .",
    "the reasons are the following . on the one hand ,",
    "these models are simple enough to allow analytic solution of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equation of the liquid state theory within some appropriate approximation . on the other hand , their potentials , albeit crude , exhibit realistic physical features ( repulsion plus surface attraction ) typical of the interactions between particles of many macromolecular fluids .",
    "furthermore , the shs models have already been successfully employed in studies on colloidal suspensions , micelles , protein solutions , microemulsions , flocculation , and crystallization stell91,jamnik96,santos98,jamnik01 .",
    "the first and most known model ( shs1 ) was proposed by baxter baxter68,baxter71a , baxter71b , barboy74 . its pair potential adds to a hard sphere ( hs ) repulsion an attractive square - well ( sw ) , which becomes infinitely deep and narrow according to a limiting procedure ( baxter s ` sticky limit ' ) that keeps the second virial coefficient finite baxter68 . for pure fluids",
    "the starting potential is    @xmath0    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the distance between particles , @xmath3 the hs diameter , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the depth and width of the well , respectively , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being boltzmann s constant , and @xmath8 the temperature ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath9 is an _",
    "arbitrary _ monotonically increasing function of @xmath10 baxter71b , and @xmath11 is a measure of ` stickiness ' between particles . in the limit",
    "@xmath12 @xmath13 becomes the hs potential with diameter @xmath14 the logarithmic form of @xmath15 serves to generate a simple expression for the boltzmann factor , @xmath16 $ ] , i.e.    @xmath17 = \\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{lll } 0 , &   & 0<r<\\sigma \\\\",

    "however , the difficulty in applying the multi - component shs1-py solution to polydisperse colloidal mixtures with a large number @xmath22 of components ( due to the presence of @xmath23 coupled quadratic equations @xcite to be solved numerically ) has led to two more recent attempts of finding an alternative shs model , which could be analytically tractable even in the general multi - component case brey87,mier89,ginoza96,tutschka98,tutschka00,tutschka01,tutschka02,gazzillo00,gazzillo02a , gazzillo02b , gazzillo03a , gazzillo03b , timoneda89,ginoza01,jamnik91,hoye93 .",
    "we shall refer to them as shs2 @xcite and shs3 models @xcite . in shs2 the adhesive part of the potential",
    "is generated from an attractive yukawa tail , whose amplitude and inverse range become infinite in the sticky limit , while their ratio remains constant .",
    "the shs3 model has been proposed to replace shs2 , overcoming a recently discovered pathology while retaining some useful features of the previous model .    as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crucial difference between shs1 and shs2 lies in the attractive part of the interaction , since the area of the shs1 well vanishes as @xmath24 when the width @xmath25 goes to zero , while the corresponding integral remains finite in the shs2 case .    for shs2 , the oz equation was analytically solved within the _ mean spherical approximation _ ( msa ) @xcite , and the multi - component shs2-msa solution is indeed much simpler than its shs1-py counterpart .    on the other hand ,",
    "baxter s shs1 model was never solved analytically within the msa or other closures different from the py one .",
    "note that in the msa the main input for the direct correlation function is the potential sw1 itself , which has , in the sticky limit , a weaker ( logarithmic ) divergence than the boltzmann factor .",
    "thus it would be interesting to investigate other approximations which consider , more correctly , the boltzmann factor rather than the potential , in a way similar to the py case .",
    "motivated by this scenario , in this paper we would like to revisit baxter s model within a new framework . we consider a general class of closures which , as the py , hinge on the vanishing of the direct correlation function beyond a finite range @xmath26 .",
    "each component of the class is identified by a different approximation to the cavity function in the intermediate region @xmath27 .",
    "we shall show that this difference survives even in the limit @xmath28 and hence it gives rise to different solutions , each of  them being characterized by a different expression for a single parameter @xmath29 .    in this class",
    "we first consider a subset of closures which is based on density expansion of the cavity function .",
    "all these closures yield a simpler solution than the py one , and yet they provide a satisfactory description on regimes frequently encountered in experiments on colloids and globular proteins . the solutions corresponding to these closures could be straightforwardly extended to multi - component fluids , unlike the py case .    in addition , we identify a second subclass of closures as a possible route to improve over the py approximation .    finally , we provide a careful discussion on the equation of state derived from this class of solutions . in this process , we critically discuss the correct way of taking the ` sticky limit ' and its influence on the predicted structural and termodynamic properties of the model .",
    "a short - cut , but not fully equivalent , procedure may in fact generate an incorrect result for the virial equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we point out that pitfalls of this sort have already occurred in the case of shs1 mixtures @xcite .",
    "such a problem should be clearly borne in mind when investigating thermodynamic properties of more complex fluid models which include sticky interaction terms in the pair potential .",
    "for a one - component fluid of @xmath30 molecules in a volume @xmath31 with spherically symmetric interactions , the oz equation is the convolution relationship    @xmath32    which defines the ` direct correlation function ' ( dcf ) @xmath33 in terms of the ` total correlation function ' @xmath34 , deviation of the ` radial distribution function ' ( rdf ) @xmath35 from its ideal gas value of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 . here , the asterisk represents three - dimensional convolution , i.e. @xmath38  @xmath39 .",

    "solving the baxter equations is tantamount to determining @xmath43 , from which @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be easily calculated . to solve the oz equation , some approximate ` closure ' relating @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the potential @xmath46 must be added .      for hard - core fluids",

    "these differences persist _ even in the sticky limit _",
    "@xmath66 !",

    "let us apply the gpy approximation to the model defined by baxter s sw1 potential .",
    "different approximations to @xmath64 generate , of course , different solutions ( which we are not able to write explicitly in analytic terms ) .",
    "it is however surprising that , as shown in appendix a , the differences among all these solutions drastically reduce in the sticky limit all being included in one common parameter , @xmath71 , while the @xmath2 dependence becomes identical .",
    "as a consequence of this degeneracy , the oz equation for the shs1 model admits , for _ all _ members of the gpy class of ( mixed ) closures , the following general _ analytic _ solution @xmath72 \\theta \\left ( \\sigma -r\\right ) , \\qquad \\text { for \\ } r\\geq 0 ,   \\label{so1}\\]]@xmath73@xmath74where @xmath75 denotes the cavity function at contact and , for simplicity , the subscript shs1-gpy has been omitted in @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath29 .",

    "although this result may appear odd at first sight , it is nevertheless consistent with our previous discussion .",
    "the virial eos depends not only on @xmath259 after the sticky limit , but also on the ` tail ' of the original potential .",
    "it is also worth stressing that the evaluation of the msa virial eos for sw fluids embodies a further subtle point not present in the py virial eos , because of the discontinuity of @xmath142 @xcite ( see appendix b ) .",
    "one could reasonably expect the above divergence to be a consequence of the poorness of the msa closure , which should disappear by resorting to more accurate approximations .",
    "unfortunately , the virial eos diverges within the c0-approximation too ( see appendix b ) :    @xmath260    and thus higher - order closures should be considered .",
    "in order to give a flavor of the difference appearing in the different approximations , we present here some results and an interesting comparison with monte carlo ( mc ) simulation data @xcite .      figures 1 and 2 depict msa , c0 , c1 and py results for the structure factor @xmath205 , compared with the corresponding mc data @xcite .",
    "four thermodynamic states are considered and we have displayed the corresponding results in order of decreasing @xmath152 .",

    "these data are less susceptible to finite size effects than the original ones kranendonk88 .    as msa curves coincide with the hs ones",
    ", one can clearly appreciate the effects of surface attraction present in the shs1 model . as is known gazzillo00,gazzillo02a , at high values of  @xmath152 repulsive forces predominate and the structure factor of sticky hard spheres resembles that of hard spheres , although heights and positions of peaks are quite different ( see figure 1 ) . lowering @xmath152 ( i.e. decreasing temperature or increasing stickiness ) leads to a different behaviour characterized by a strong increase of @xmath262 , which is related to the isothermal compressibility and the density fluctuations .",
    "the observed development of such a new peak at @xmath263 ( see figure 2 ) signals the approach to a gas - liquid phase transition ( @xmath264 diverges at the spinodal curve ) . while there is a good overall agreement between mc data and py predictions",
    ", one can observe that the c0 and c1 curves lie rather close to the py ones .",

    "the largest discrepancies among the different approximations occur near the origin ( see 2c ) ) .",
    "figures 3 and 4 illustrate the behaviour of the compressibility pressure , @xmath265 .",
    "in all the considered cases , the performance of the c0 and c1 approximations is quite good ( again , c1 is slightly better than c0 ) .",
    "the c0 , c1 and py results are nearly coincident in the interval @xmath266 , which covers the concentration range typical of many colloidal or protein solutions .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show the predictions for pressure obtained from the energy route , @xmath267 .",
    "now , there are much larger differences with  respect to the py and mc results .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that , unlike the py case @xcite , within the c0 and c1 closures the compressibility route appears to be superior than the energy one .      as a final illustrative example ,",
    "we report here a sample of gpy1 results . in figure 7 gpy1 and py predictions for @xmath261",
    "are compared with the mc simulation for the state @xmath268 . in general the py theory tends to underestimate the amplitude of the oscillations in @xmath261 .",
    "now the improvement present in @xmath269 is reflected in the behaviour of @xmath261 near the origin . in this region , while the py curve lies below the mc data , the gpy1 one has a more correct trend .",
    "on the other hand , since the py critical point evaluated via the compressibility route ( i.e. via  @xmath270 ) is known to be underestimated with respect to the exact one @xcite , one can reasonably expect that @xmath271 may be underestimated too .",
    "we have not considered thermodynamics corresponding to the gpy1 closure , since such a task would probably require analytical / numerical calculations which go beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "one could expect , however , results not significantly different from the py ones .",
    "we have shown that baxter s model ( hard spheres with an infinitely deep and narrow attractive square - well ) is analytically solvable not only within the py approximation but also within a general class of closures .",
    "we have denoted this class as ` generalized py ' approximation , since all its elements are ` mixed closures ' , which coincide with the py one beyond @xmath26 , the upper boundary of the well , but may employ a different approximation within the well region @xmath27 .",
    "it has been argued that , even in the limit of vanishing width of the well , there is a ` memory ' of the approximation to @xmath81 chosen within the well , and this has been identified as the distinguishing feature of each closure of the gpy class .    in particular , we have shown that : i ) the shs1 model can be solved analytically within the msa closure , but its shs1-msa solution has nothing to do with the shs2-msa one and is equal to @xmath144 ; ii ) an interesting analytic solution can be obtained also within the mmsa ( or c0-approximation ) .",
    "the resulting factor correlation function @xmath272 is formally identical with @xmath273 ( if @xmath152 is replaced with the reduced temperature @xmath274 ) , obtained for the shs3 model @xcite .",
    "although the solution @xmath43 of the oz integral equation , and all properties which can immediately derived from it , can be carried out within the unified gpy treatment , the calculation of other properties may require an analysis starting from the original sw potential , i.e. _ before _ the sticky limit",
    ". a detailed analysis of the non - commutativity of the sticky limit with other operations in some instances , notably for the virial eos , has been provided . in principle",
    ", one could extend the above remarks from the shs case to any general model with sticky terms in the pair potential . within this more general viewpoint ,",
    "the presence of dirac @xmath275-functions in any of the functions @xmath276 , @xmath33 , @xmath35 could be regarded as an indication that the procedure of ` sticky limit from the outset ' is implicitly adopted .",
    "the experience of the present paper on shs systems suggests that special care should be exerted in evaluating properties where @xmath2-differentiation is required , as in the virial eos , since the corresponding results might be altered by the non - commutativity of the sticky limit .    the gpy class of closures may be roughly split into two subclasses having the py approximation as a separating borderline .",
    "the first subclass is originated by the msa , which is commonly believed as one of the simplest possible closures in view of its mean - field character .",
    "the main drawback of this closure lies in its linear relationship with the potential , which prevents a correct zero - density limit of the correlation functions .",
    "we have cured this by modifying the closure so that the c0-direct correlation function is related to the mayer function rather than to the potential , and in this case the correct zero - density limit is recovered .",
    "finally , an explicit density - dependence can be perturbatively included in the closure , order by order , through a density expansion .",
    "we have discussed in detail the analytical results stemming from the zero ( c0 ) and first ( c1 ) order terms in density expansion and a comparison with monte carlo simulations shows that , in spite of the crudity of the approximations , the resulting structure factors are rather close to the mc data for a wide range of the parameters .",
    "our main interest in the closures of this first subclass is that they are simple enough to allow an easy extension to mixtures and application to polydisperse fluids , unlike the py case .",
    "the main disadvantage is , on the other hand , represented by strong thermodynamic inconsistencies , which can not be coped with in a simple way .",
    "the closures of the second subclass have in fact been devised to the aim of reducing these inconsistencies , by exploiting the additional contribution @xmath189 to @xmath97 .",
    "we have given only an illustrative example ( called gpy1 ) to show how small differences in the contact value of the cavity function can produce , for instance , a different behaviour of @xmath261 near the origin .",
    "on the other hand , the _ exact _ dcf is expected to possess also a ` tail ' for @xmath67 , which all gpy closures neglect .",
    "the presence of this tail ( which could be approximated , for instance , by a yukawa function ) implies that the _ exact _ solution @xmath277 can not coincide with @xmath278 .",
    "these slight differences can be expected to be essential in order to achieve thermodynamic consistency , so that the use of the mentioned @xmath182 is useful but probably not sufficient . in this framework",
