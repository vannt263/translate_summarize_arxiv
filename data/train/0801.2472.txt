    "pseudoscalar meson - meson scattering up to the 1 - 2gev energy range is of interest for several related reasons . on the one hand",
    "this region is beyond that where chiral perturbation theory has traditionally been applied and below that where we can use perturbative qcd , so it is a challenge to develop a framework to calculate these amplitudes from first principles . at the same time there are many resonances in this region , some of which are controversial from the point of view of establishing their properties experimentally and their quark substructure . in particular , the scalar mesons are a long - standing puzzle in meson spectroscopy because , for example , there are too many states to fit into a single su(3 ) nonet and the masses and decay patterns of some of the scalar resonances are not what would would expect for quark - antiquark scalar states .",
    "this talk is based on approaches developed by the syracuse group .",
    "many other interesting approaches are given in the proceedings of this conference and also cited in the references given in the bibliography .",
    "we begin@xcite,@xcite with the conventional chiral lagrangian , including only pseudoscalars : @xmath1 , \\label{lps}\\ ] ] in which @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the @xmath4 matrix of pseudoscalar fields and @xmath5 mev the pion decay constant .",
    "@xmath6 is a diagonal matrix @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we add a nonet of scalar mesons , which transform like external fields under chiral transformations .",
    "it turns out@xcite that the trilinear scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar interaction that follows from the general chiral invariant extension of @xmath10 to include a scalar meson nonet is given by @xmath11 the first term of ( [ interactions ] ) may be eliminated in favor of the more standard form @xmath12 , but is interesting because it is the ozi rule conserving term for a dual diquark - antidiquark type nonet mentioned below .",
    "the scalar particles with non - trivial quantum numbers are given by : @xmath13\\ ] ] with @xmath14 .",
    "there are two iso - singlet states : the combination @xmath15 is an @xmath16 singlet while @xmath17 belongs to an @xmath16 octet .",
    "these will in general mix with each other when @xmath16 is broken .",
    "we can write the general mass term@xcite @xmath18 where a , b , c and d are real constants .",
    "@xmath19 is the `` spurion matrix '' @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the ratio of strange to non - strange quark masses in the usual interpretation .",
    "we take a convention where the physical particles , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which diagonalize the mass matrix obtained from ( [ mixing - mass - lag ] ) are related to the basis states @xmath24 and @xmath25 by @xmath26 for a given set of inputs for the masses of the four scalar mesons @xmath22 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 the constants a , b , c and d are fixed and there are two possible solutions for the mixing angle @xmath30 .",
    "we note that there are different possibilities , in addition to quark - antiquark configurations , for the underlying quark substructure of @xmath31 which all give rise to the same su(3 ) transformation properties .",
    "for example , forming diquark objects @xmath32 where the antisymmeterisation of the quark fields is implicit , we can form a pure tetraquark scalar nonet as follows : @xmath33 \\label{multiquark - nonet}\\ ] ] or construct linear combinations of @xmath34 and @xmath35 nonets .",
    "we studied s - wave pseudoscalar meson scattering in a framework beginning with eqs.([lps ] ) and ( [ interactions ] ) .",
    "if we begin with the tree - level scattering amplitudes , which due to chiral symmetry give good agreement with experiment close to the scattering threshold , we find that they soon deviate from the experimental data .",
    "they also violate unitarity .",
    "the approach that we took was to add an imaginary piece by hand to the tree - level propogator of the s - channel resonance . for @xmath36 k scattering we called the lightest strange scalar resonance @xmath29 and made the substitution : @xmath37 in the denominator of the s - channel s - wave amplitude . in order to fit to experiment the quantity @xmath38 was left as a free parameter , not necessarily equal to the perturbative width",
    ", @xmath39 say .",
    "our fit@xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ pikfit ] gave @xmath40 showing a substantial deviation from a breit - wigner resonance for which this ratio would be exactly equal to 1 .",
    "good agreement with experiment was also found@xcite with this generalised breit - wigner prescription for the case of @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the other fitting parameters are the scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling constants , which can all be written in terms of the four coefficients in the interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ interactions ] ) , the scalar meson masses and mixing angle .",
    "we note also that , in addition to neatly explaining the mass ordering and general pattern of decays of the scalar states below 1 gev , a multiquark interpretation for these states is also suggested by the value of the scalar meson octet - singlet mixing angle @xmath30 defined in eq .",
    "( [ mixing - convention1 ] ) , which was a parameter fixed by our fits .",
    "our best fit was about @xmath41 which , in our mixing convention , would be close to ideal mixing for a `` dual '' diquark - antidiquark nonet .",
    "in the three flavor linear sigma model the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons appear together since the model is constructed from the @xmath42 matrix field @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents a scalar nonet and @xmath45 a pseudoscalar nonet . under a chiral transformation @xmath46 , @xmath47 of the fundamental left and right handed light quark fields ,",
    "m is defined to transform as @xmath48 we considered a general non - renormalizable lagrangian of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an arbitrary function of the independent @xmath51 invariants @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 . of these",
    ", only @xmath56 is not invariant under @xmath57 .",
    "the symmetry breaker @xmath58 has the minimal form @xmath59 where the @xmath60 are real numbers which turn out to be proportional to the three light ( `` current '' type ) quark masses . in this model",
    "there are many constraints among the parameters .",
    "for example , many of the trilinear scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling constants are predicted in terms of the pseudoscalar and scalar meson masses .",
    "another difference is that [ compare with eq .",
    "( [ interactions ] ) ] this trilinear interaction does not involve derivatives . both models give the `` current algebra '' results in the limit where the scalar mesons are integrated out .",
    "if we calculate the tree level s - wave amplitudes they deviate from experiment and also violate unitarity as we go beyond the threshold region .",
    "we used@xcite the well - known k - matrix procedure to unitarise the linear sigma model amplitudes and then checked if the resulting unitary amplitudes can give a good fit to data . in the standard parameterization @xcite of a given partial wave s - matrix : @xmath61 we identify @xmath62 @xmath63 is the given partial wave t - matrix computed at tree level in the linear sigma model and is purely real .",
    "this scheme gives exact unitarity for t but violates the crossing symmetry which @xmath63 itself obeys . in fig .",
    "[ pipifit ] we show our best fit to the i = j=0 @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "the parameters in this fit are the `` bare '' masses of the two i=0 scalar mesons in @xmath64 and their mixing angle . using these parameters",
    "we can solve for the poles in the unitarised amplitude in the complex s plane .",
    "labelling these poles @xmath65 and @xmath66 we can identify the physical masses and widths as usual from the real and imaginary parts , for example @xmath67 .",
    "scattering amplitude in a linear sigma model with k - matrix unitarisation@xcite.__,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we have found good agreement with scattering data in the approaches based on the non - linear chiral lagrangians outlined in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "we are currently studying scattering using the non - linear chiral lagrangian approach outlined of section 2 , but employing the k - matrix unitarisation as described in section 3 .",
    "this may make it easier to compare the linear and non - linear chiral lagrangian models more directly and to understand the effects of the unitarisation prescriptions in themselves .",
    "this was partly motivated by our work on extending the non - linear chiral lagrangian approach to include vector mesons@xcite .",
    "this enabled us to study the interesting rare radiative decay processes @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we found that the shape of the partial branching fraction depends quite sensitively on whether we use derivative or non - derivative scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling as in section 2 or 3 respectively .",
    "a summary of our results is shown in table [ comparison ] for the case of @xmath0 scattering . in the third and fourth columns we show the results of the analyses described in sections 3 and 2 respectively . in the fourth column",
    "we give the results with and without the inclusion of the @xmath70 vector meson . in column 2",
    "we show the results of our current analysis , which are preliminary .",
    "however we can see some trends , namely that the @xmath27 parameters are quite stable , whereas the @xmath22 parameters seem to depend more on the model and , even more , on the unitarisation procedure .",
    "these results are preliminary because we have only done a fit of @xmath0 scattering data over a limited energy range .",
    "also we have not included the inelastic channel and so the important @xmath71 threshold region .",
