    "( [ dissipation ] ) with the same rate @xmath101 for all the local baths .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig : psinkfmo ] ) we show the site population behaviour as a function of time for the case of @xmath103 and the transfer efficiency @xmath34 for different values of @xmath101 . coupling to lightly damped coherent modes ( @xmath117 ) gives a very large improvement of the transport , as compared with the noiseless case , with @xmath118 at @xmath119 .",
    "this is close to complete transfer .",
    "note that for this case the populations , notably in sites 1 and 2 , display strong oscillations for up to @xmath119 , i.e. , the whole transport time .",
    "this is perhaps interesting as it shows that persistent oscillations are not necessarily inconsistent with fast and total transport .",
    "this should be contrasted to the lindblad dephasing model of the previous sections , in which we found that excitonic coherences are observable only over the first @xmath120 of the total transport time when the transport is optmized .",
    "another interesting observation is that this non - markovian model appears to be able to implement the enhancement and suppression of pathways through the fmo energy landscape very well , better in fact than the optimised markov case . comparing fig .",
    "( [ fig : psinkmarkov ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : psinkfmo ] ) we see that in the local mode simulation , the bath strongly suppresses the transfer of populations from sites @xmath33 and @xmath69 to sites @xmath65 which occurs via the resonant path ( iii ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pathways ] ) in the absence of noise . while markovian noise",
    "evetually destroys these coherent oscillations ` across the molecule ' , there is still a substantial leakage via incoherent tunneling into sites @xmath65and their total population reaches as high as @xmath121 at @xmath122 . in the local mode case ,",
    "the total population of sites @xmath65 never rise above @xmath123 .",
    "apart from sites @xmath33 and @xmath69 , the only sites to become significantly populated are sites @xmath64 and @xmath93 , which are closely linked to the sink .",
    "the local modes seem to localise the excitations more effectively around the sink and prevents the exploration of inefficient paths like ( iii ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pathways ] ) .    from the point of view of noise engineering",
    ", it seems that the application of non - markovian , quantum noise might allow for a more precise control of the direction and speed of the dynamics .",
    "however , it remains to be shown that the strong effect we see is not just due to a fine tuning of exciton and mode parameters in the hamiltonian , i.e .",
    "we would like to see how robust this non - markovian dat is .",
    "this point can be partially investigated by looking at the damping of these modes . as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : psinkfmo ] ) , damping the modes leads to an incremental improvement of the transport efficiency as the damping rate @xmath101 acting on each site is increased from the value @xmath103 ( blue curve ) to @xmath124 ( red ) and @xmath125 ( black ) .",
    "this incremental improvment in transport efficiency coincides with increasingly fast decay of the oscillations of the population dynamics ( not shown ) .",
    "this shows that the long - lasting population oscillations in this noise model which are seen for weak mode - damping are likely to involve exciton coherences mediated by the local modes .",
    "increasing the damping of the local modes makes the effective environment seen by the excitons more markovian in nature and lead to increases in the tranport efficiency as evidenced by the behaviour of @xmath34 .",
    "this conclusion that increasing markovianity increases the transport rate differs from the one obtained within a different noise model put forward recently in @xcite , where an enhancement of the transfer rate was observed when the exciton - bath interaction was treated without the markov approximation .",
    "it seems clear that linking markovian or non - markovian effects to an improved or slowed down transfer is not straightforward and strongly depends on specific features of the noise model being considered , and perhaps there is no universal , model - independent , relation between non - markovian effects and efficiency of eet . as a result , we can conclude that while the process of eet in fmo is clearly noise - assisted , in the sense that evolution under the exciton hamiltonian can not account alone for the observed transport efficiency , the eet dynamics and the transport efficiency as measured by @xmath34 are very sensitive to the specific noise model . in particular , efficient transport with long - lasting oscillations might arise from any combination of weak markovian damping , slow , non - markovian environments as in refs.@xcite , spatially - correlated baths @xcite , or coupling to local modes as shown here .    as the role of noise is clearly crucial for efficient eet ,",
    "further experimental results are needed to discriminate these different noise models .",
    "one important issue related to this is whether or not , at physiological temperatures , the net effect of the dephasing due to the coupling of the complex to the protein environment can be modelled in terms of a classical , fluctuating field or must be treated explicitly as a _ quantum environment _ , like the zero temperature localized mode model discussed in this section .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of quantum correlations amongst the excitons @xcite , and also between the bath and exciton system @xcite , is also expected to be sensitive to the noise model , and the recent formulation of efficient techniques for the tomographic characterization of many - body systems @xcite may allow for experiments which can directly probe the nature of the exciton - protein coupling in photosynthetic complexes .",
    "we have revisited the basic mechanisms by which pure dephasing noise can open up or suppress pathways through the energy landscape of a quantum network , and have shown how these processes can dramatically increase the eficiency of eet relative to their noiseless evolution . using these insights , we contructed a hybrid basis for analysing the fmo dynamics and indicated the key pathways which are responsible for the inefficiency of the eet in the absence of noise . for excitations to propagate efficienctly ,",
    "these pathways must either be avoided or inhibited , and we have shown within a fully markovian approach how pure dephasing noise acheives this , and how it effects each of the principal pathsways individually . as the identification of the transport - suppressing pathways is made without any reference to the noise model , we believe that any noise model that enhances tranport must more or less carry out this strategy of supresing the inefficient paths and enhancing the direct relaxation channels .",
    "this intuition is supported by our results using the non - markovian local mode model , where we find a very effective suppression of the inefficient pathways , leading to a transport time which can even exceed the optimised markovian dynamics .",
    "the results obtained from these models emphasize how knowledge of the underlying hamiltonian , when expressed in an appropriate basis , might allow the possiblility of using appplied noise almost as an enginering tool for the creation of artifical light - harvsting architectures .",
    "though we have demonstrated the technique for the fenna - matthew - olson ( fmo ) complex , we could use such a path analyisis to quite literally follow the movement of the excitation across any network to the sink , and enhance the energy flow with selective application of appropriate noise interactions .",
    "we have also shown in our local mode noise model , that the experimentally observed transfer time can occur through dynamics which preserve coherences and entanglement across the whole transport time .",
    "the optmized markovian theory can only preserve coherences for @xmath120 of this time .",
    "the potential relevance of this observation for understanding the long - lasting coherences observed in fmo and other photosynthetic complexes still remains unclear , and in particular , the effects of temperature must be understood before a connection to the experimental data can be made .",
    "however , this model provides an interesting new system for studying _ quantum noise_-assisted transport , and further emphaises one of the underlying message of this paper , which is ; the neccesary tasks of enhancing exciton transport revealed by our path analysis can be acheived by a rich variety of noise models , each of which can generate very different dynamics .",
    "as noise is a crucial part of the efficiency of eet in photosynthetic complexes , the need for experimental discrimination of noise models is paramount .",
    "such studies would also provide clues to the still unanswered question of whether quantum mechanics , in the form of coherence and entanglement , is necessary for eet or if it is just an inevitable consequence of quantum mechanical evolution on the short length and timescales found in pigment - protein complexes . answering",
    "this question will require further studies in energy transport across connected networks in the presence of various noise models , with interesting ramifications for the role of coherence and entanglement in the dynamics of interacting systems .",
