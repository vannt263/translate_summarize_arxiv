    "consider a multiuser communication system in which a number of users must share common resources such as frequency , time , or space .",
    "the mathematical model for this communication scenario is the well - known _ interference channel _ , which consists of multiple transmitters simultaneously sending messages to their intended receivers while causing interference to each other .",
    "interference channel is a generic model for multiuser communication and can be used in many practical applications such as digital subscriber lines ( dsl ) @xcite , cognitive radio ( cr ) systems @xcite and ad - hoc wireless networks @xcite .",
    "a central issue in the study of interference channel is how to mitigate multiuser interference . in practice , there are several commonly used methods for dealing with interference .",
    "first , we can treat the interference as noise and just focus on extracting the desired signals ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is widely used in practice because of its simplicity and ease of implementation , but is known to be non - capacity achieving in general .",
    "an alternative technique is channel orthogonalization whereby transmitted signals are chosen to be nonoverlapping either in time , frequency or space , leading to time division multiple access , frequency division multiple access or space division multiple access respectively . while channel orthogonalization effectively eliminates multiuser interference , it can lead to inefficient use of communication resources and is also generally non - capacity achieving .",
    "another interference management technique is to decode and remove interference .",
    "specifically , when interference is strong relative to desired signals , a user can decode the interference first , then subtract it from the received signal , and finally decode its own message ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this method is less common in practice due to its complexity and security issues .    in a cellular system ,",
    "multi - cell interference management is a major challenge .",
    "so far various base station cooperation techniques have been proposed to mitigate inter - cell interferences , including multi - point coordinated transmission , or network mimo transmission @xcite .",
    "most of these techniques require each base station to have full / partial channel state information ( csi ) as well as the knowledge of actual independent data streams to all remote terminals . with the complete sharing of data streams and csi ,",
    "the multi - cell scenario is effectively reduced to a single cell interference management problem with either total @xcite or per - group - of - antennas power constraints @xcite .",
    "while these techniques can offer significant improvement on data throughput , they also have several drawbacks including stringent requirement on base station coordination , the large demand on the communication bandwidth of backhaul links , and the heavy computational load associated with the increasing number of cells @xcite .    theoretically , what is the optimal interference management strategy ?",
    "the answer is related to the characterization of capacity region of an interference channel , i.e. , determining the set of rate tuples that can be achieved by the users simultaneously . for the noiseless case ,",
    "the capacity region and the optimal precoding strategy of the two user interference channel is discussed in @xcite and @xcite . in spite of intensive research on this subject over the past three decades ( @xcite - @xcite ) ,",
    "the capacity region of interference channels is still unknown for general case ( even for small number of users ) .",
    "the lack of progress to characterize the capacity region for a mimo interference channel has motivated researchers to derive various approximations of the capacity region .",
    "for example , the maximum total degrees of freedom ( dof ) corresponds to the first order approximation of sum - rate capacity of an interference channel at high snr regime .",
    "maximizing this approximation of sum - rate leads us to the interference alignment method @xcite . for frequency selective channels",
    ", interference alignment corresponds to correlated signalling across different frequency tones .",
    "this linear transceiver scheme for interference alignment is a generalization of the standard ofdma scheme whereby each data stream is transmitted on a single subcarrier , which corresponds to using the standard unit basis vectors @xmath0 ( the @xmath1-th standard unit vector ) for transmit beamforming .",
    "the linear transceiver structure for interference alignment is more general since it does not require diagonal structure nor mutual orthogonality ( two transmit covariance matrices @xmath2 , @xmath3 are said to be orthogonal if @xmath4 ) .",
    "if we remove mutual orthogonality condition and impose only diagonal structure on transmit covariance matrices , then the interference management problem is reduced to the dynamic spectrum management problem @xcite where the goal is to find the optimal power allocation ( i.e. , optimal diagonal transmit covariance matrices ) which can maximize system throughput .",
    "this problem has recently been a topic of intensive research in the signal processing and communications communities . for diagonal matrix channel case ( e.g. frequency selective scenario )",
    ", the problem of maximizing sum - rate has been shown to be np - hard @xcite .",
    "several algorithms have been proposed which provide varied performance in different channel conditions .",
    "these include : iterative waterfilling algorithm iwfa @xcite , successive convex approximation low complexity ( scale ) algorithm @xcite , autonomous spectrum balancing ( asb)@xcite , optimal spectrum balancing ( osb ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , different algorithms are proposed for the case when the channel matrices are non - diagonal .",
    "authors in @xcite proposed iwfa based algorithms for power allocation . however , these selfish approaches work well only in low snr cases or when the interference is low .",
    "compared to the networked mimo approach , interference alignment requires less information exchange among transmitters , and is therefore simpler to implement in practice . recently two iterative algorithms have been proposed for interference alignment @xcite .",
    "both appear to work well in simulation of small systems ( e.g. , three users , each equipped with two antennas ) .",
    "these algorithms require system users to first specify the dofs for all receivers and then attempt to achieve them by iteratively aligning the interferences . however , these algorithms can not check if a given tuple of dof is achievable , nor is there any guarantee for reaching interference alignment even when the given tuple of dof is achievable . moreover , by focusing only on high snr regime and interference alignment , these algorithms do not attempt any power allocations across different data streams .",
    "this can result in linear transceivers with suboptimal performance at low to intermediate snrs .    in this paper , we consider the problem of maximizing the sum of dofs and the problem of checking if a given set of dofs is achievable with linear transceivers .",
    "we study the complexity status of both of these problems over the spatial domain and establish their np - hardness .",
    "these results suggest that the two existing algorithms for interference alignment @xcite can not converge in general .",
    "we also propose a distributed algorithm to design linear transceivers for interference channels .",
    "our approach is based on using mmse receivers while optimizing transmit covariance matrices for all transmitters .",
    "we maximize the weighted sum of a utility of sinr s for each data stream and use iterative convex optimization / relaxation to compute a ( local ) optimal solution .",
    "the utility function is @xmath5 which converges to @xmath6 when sinr @xmath7 , and is proportional to sinr when the sinr value is small . in this way , maximizing the sum of utilities for all data streams corresponds to maximizing the total dof when the noise vanishes .",
    "simulations show that our algorithm performs well in all snr regions and can deliver far superior sum - rate performance than the existing interference alignment algorithms of @xcite .",
    "compared to the networked mimo approach which requires sharing of data streams , our linear transceiver design algorithm requires less information exchange : at each iteration , only small covariance matrices are exchanged , the size of which are proportional to the antenna numbers at each transmitter or receiver .",
    "consider a @xmath8-user mimo interference channel with @xmath8 transmitter - receiver pairs .",
    "let @xmath9 be an @xmath10 matrix representing the channel gain from transmitter  @xmath11 to receiver  @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the number of antennas at transmitter  @xmath11 and receiver  @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the received signal at receiver  @xmath12 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an @xmath17 random vector that represents the transmitted signal of user  @xmath11 and @xmath18 is a zero mean additive white gaussian noise . + for practical considerations , we focus on optimal _ linear _ transmit and receive strategies that can maximize system throughput . in particular ,",
    "suppose transmitter  @xmath12 uses a beamforming matrix @xmath19 to send the signal vector @xmath20 to its intended receiver  @xmath12 .",
    "at the receiver side , receiver  @xmath12 estimates the transmitted data vector @xmath20 by using a linear beamforming matrix @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 where the data vector @xmath23 is normalized so that @xmath24 = \\mathbf{i}$ ] , and @xmath25 is the estimate of @xmath20 at @xmath12-th receiver . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the beamforming matrices at the transmitter and the receiver of user  @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "it is known that the problem of designing optimal beamformers to maximize sum - rate of the system is np - hard @xcite even in the single transmit / receive antenna case .",
    "notice that recent works @xcite suggest that the optimal strategy should have interference alignment structure in the high snr regime .",
    "therefore , we are led to find a linear transmission - reception strategy that can maximize the total degrees of freedom . in the next section ,",
    "we provide the complexity analysis of this problem .",
    "in this section , we show that for a given channel , not only the problem of finding the maximum dof is np - hard , but also the problem of checking the achievability of a given tuple of dof , @xmath28 , is np - hard when there are at least 3 antennas at each node .",
    "notice that the interference alignment conditions in the @xmath12-th receiver are @xmath29 the first equation guarantees that all the interference is in the subspace orthogonal to @xmath21 while the second one assures that the signal subspace @xmath30 has dimension @xmath31 and is linearly independent of the interference subspace .    in the sequel , we examine the solvability of above interference alignment problem - in two different cases .",
    "[ thm : nphard ] for a @xmath8 user mimo interference channel , maximizing the total dof , namely , @xmath32 is np - hard .",
    "moreover , if each node is equipped with at least 3 antennas , then the problem of checking the achievability of a given tuple of dof , @xmath33 , is also np - hard .",
    "the proof of the first part is based on a polynomial time reduction from the maximum independent set problem which is known to be np - complete . for a given arbitrary graph @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ,",
    "consider a @xmath8 user interference channel that each receiver and transmitter has a single antenna .",
    "moreover , the channel coefficients are given by : @xmath36 it can be checked that the receiver nodes can only achieve a dof of either 0 or 1 , and those receiver nodes achieving a dof of 1 form an independent set in @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the problem of maximizing the total dof for the above interference channel is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum independent set of vertices in the graph @xmath37 . + in order to prove the second part we use a polynomial reduction from the 3-colorability problem .",
    "the latter problem is to determine whether the nodes of a graph can be assigned one of the three possible colors so that no two adjacent nodes are colored the same .",
    "the 3-colorability problem is known to be np - complete .",
    "there are two main steps in the construction . in the first step ,",
    "some dummy nodes are added to the channel in order to force a discrete structure such that each non - dummy node may only have one of the three possible cases .",
    "the second step is to define the direct channels in order to make a polynomial reduction from the 3-colorability of an arbitrary graph to this problem .    for an arbitrary graph @xmath37 with @xmath38 nodes",
    ", we will construct a special mimo interference channel for which the achievability of one degree of freedom at each user is equivalent to the 3-colarability of @xmath37 . in our construction ,",
    "the mimo interference channel will have two types of users : @xmath38 main users , each equipped with 3 antennas at their transmitters and receivers and @xmath39 dummy users which will be defined later .",
    "hence the total number of users is @xmath40 . in the rest of the proof",
    "we suppose that each user ( either the dummy user or the main user ) wants to send one data stream . in other words",
    "we want to check if the tuple of all ones is achievable by the constructed interference channel or not .",
    "we divide the dummy users into two groups .",
    "the number of dummy users in the first group is @xmath41 and the number of dummy users in the second one is @xmath42 .",
    "each dummy user in the first group has 3 antennas at its receiver and transmitter , while each dummy user in the second group has two antennas at its transmitter and receiver .",
    "let us further arrange the @xmath41 dummy users in the first group into @xmath38 subsets each containing two users .",
    "we denote these subsets as @xmath43 .",
    "we also denote the users in the set @xmath44 as @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and associate them to the @xmath1-th main user . for notational consistency",
    ", we denote main user @xmath1 as @xmath47 .",
    "we will also use @xmath48 to denote the @xmath11-th transmit antenna of user @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , we partition the set of @xmath42 dummy users in the second group into @xmath38 subsets @xmath53 , each containing exactly 9 dummy users denoted by @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "each of these @xmath56 dummy users will have two receiving antennas which we denote as @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "now for any fixed @xmath1 and @xmath11 , we consider any size-2 subset of @xmath59 , e.g. , @xmath60 .",
    "for each fixed @xmath1 and @xmath61 , there are exactly 3 of these cardinality-2 subsets .",
    "since there are 3 different choices of @xmath11 , we have a total of 9 subsets of this kind for any fixed @xmath1 .",
    "let us index these 9 subsets by @xmath62 , and assign the @xmath63-th subset to user @xmath54 in @xmath64 .",
    "now we define the links in the channel for the users in @xmath44 and @xmath64 .",
    "first , the channel matrices of all the direct links for any of the dummy users are @xmath65 ( where @xmath65 is the identity matrix of the appropriate size ) .",
    "in addition , none of the dummy users in @xmath64 ( @xmath66 ) cause interference to the other users ( which means that the channel gains between their transmit antennas and the other users receive antennas are all zero ) .",
    "now for the aforementioned @xmath63-th subset which we denote as @xmath67 , we connect @xmath68 and @xmath69 to @xmath70 and to @xmath71 , respectively . here by connecting a transmit antenna to a receive antenna we mean that the channel coefficient between these two antennas is @xmath6 .",
    "this situation is shown in the figure [ fig : example ] for the case @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that dummy users @xmath73 do not suffer from any interference .",
    ", width=264 ]    suppose that user @xmath49 ( @xmath51 ) uses the transmit beamforming vector @xmath74 .",
    "then the interference received at the dummy receiver of @xmath54 will be : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the signal user @xmath49 intends to send .",
    "notice that the signals which two different users want to transmit are statistically independent . as a consequence ,",
    "if we want to have interference alignment at the receiver of @xmath54 , so that this user can send its own data stream , it is necessary and sufficient to have @xmath77 .",
    "hence , having the interference alignment at @xmath54 for all @xmath55 is equivalent to the fact that users @xmath78 can not send their messages through the antennas with the same index , simultaneously .",
    "for example , if @xmath79 then @xmath80 and @xmath81 have to be zero . on the other hand , considering the fact that each user needs to send one data stream , it follows that none of the users @xmath82 can send their message on two of their antennas simultaneously , because otherwise if for example @xmath47 sends its message on two antennas , then it would result in insufficient spatial dimension for either @xmath45 or @xmath46 .    as an immediate consequence of these two facts we have just mentioned",
    ", we can conclude that the transmit beamforming vector at each user @xmath83 must be proportional to one of the vectors @xmath84^t$ ] , @xmath85^t$ ] or @xmath86^t$ ] .",
    "this is true specially for the main user @xmath1 .",
    "as we are not concerned about the constant factors , we have successfully imposed a discrete structure on the problem solution so far .",
    "notice that each dummy user @xmath54 has a total of 2 dimensions in its receiver .",
    "since we have aligned the interference at each dummy user @xmath54 , these users can communicate their data streams easily along the remaining dimension left for them in their receivers and remove interference which lies in the other dimension .",
    "moreover , since in our construction the dummy users @xmath73 do not experience any interference from other users and their direct channel is @xmath65 , so these users can easily achieve one degree of freedom .",
    "thus , we only need to take care of the main users .    for each of the @xmath38 main users , we must pick one of the three transmit beamforming vectors @xmath84^t$ ] , @xmath85^t$ ] or @xmath86^t$ ] in order to achieve interference alignment at all the main receivers .",
    "we suppose all the direct channels for the main users , @xmath87 , are @xmath65 . for the cross channels , we use the structure of graph @xmath88 . for each edge",
    "@xmath89 in @xmath37 , we set @xmath90 .",
    "otherwise we set @xmath91 ( zero matrix of appropriate size ) .",
    "consequently , the main users @xmath1 and @xmath11 interfere with each other if and only if they are connected to each other in graph @xmath37 .",
    "we claim that achieving interference alignment in the above mimo interference channel is equivalent to 3-colorability of graph @xmath37 .",
    "this is because each user can choose 3 possible beamforming vectors , each corresponding to a different color .",
    "if main user @xmath1 chooses one of the three possible beamforming vectors ( or one of the three colors ) , then this beamforming vector can not be chosen by any other main users adjacent to the main user @xmath1 in the graph @xmath37 , otherwise the interference would appear in the desired signal space at the receiver of main user @xmath1 .",
    "this establishes the equivalence between the 3-colorability of @xmath37 and the achievability of one degree of freedom for each user in the constructed mimo interference channel .",
    "since 3-colorability problem is np - hard , it follows that the problem of checking the feasibility of interference alignment is also np - hard .",
    "theorem [ thm : nphard ] shows that the problem of checking the achievability of a given tuple of dof is np - hard if all users ( or at least a constant fraction of them ) are equipped with at least three antennas .",
    "our next result shows that when each user is equipped with no more than two antennas , the same problem can be solved in polynomial time . to this end",
    ", we need to define some notations and make some observations .",
    "first of all , the interference alignment problem is equivalent to finding the signal subspaces at the transmitters and the interference subspaces at the receivers such that the interference alignment conditions are satisfied , i.e. , @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote the signal subspace at the transmitter @xmath12 and the interference subspace at receiver @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath95 represents the linear independence of two subspaces .",
    "the first condition implies that the signal space has dimension @xmath31 while the second condition says that the interference subspace and the received signal subspace must be linearly independent .",
    "finally , the third condition assures that the interference from other users lies in the interference subspace ( which is linearly independent of the signal subspace ) .",
    "notice that in the 2-antenna case , if @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and the interference subspace @xmath94 is known , then @xmath98 can be uniquely determined by @xmath99 , for any @xmath100 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath98 is known , we can uniquely find the interference subspace of user @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath101 .",
    "thus , by starting from a node with a known subspace and traversing the interference links with full rank channel matrices , we can uniquely determine the signal subspaces in the transmitter sides and the interference subspaces at the receiver sides as long as they all have one dof .",
    "furthermore , if we find a loop of full rank interfering links , the signal subspaces at these nodes must be the eigenvector of the composite channel matrix of the corresponding loop . to make this point clear ,",
    "consider a 4-user interference channel .",
    "if all interfering links are full rank , by starting from transmitter 1 and use the loop tx1 @xmath102 rx2 @xmath102 tx3 @xmath102 rx4",
    "@xmath102 tx1 , we have the following relations @xmath103 thus , @xmath104 must be the eigenvector of the loop channel matrix @xmath105 . using this observation and the idea of traversing the full rank interfering channel links",
    ", we can establish the polynomial solvability of the problem of checking the achievability of a given tuple of dof .",
    "[ thm:2 ] for a @xmath8-user mimo interference channel where each transmit / receive node is equipped with at most two antennas , the problem of checking the achievability of a given tuple of dof is polynomial time solvable .    by assigning zero channel weight if necessary",

    "furthermore , notice that if a user has zero dof ( @xmath108 ) , then we can assign the zero beamforming vector to this user and remove it ( both its transmitter and receiver ) from the system .",

    "now the problem is to determine whether the given tuple of dof @xmath111 is achievable or not . to this end",

    "<S> consider a mimo interference channel whereby each transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas . </S>",
    "<S> the basic problem is to design optimal linear transceivers ( or beamformers ) that can maximize system throughput . </S>",
    "<S> the recent work @xcite suggests that optimal beamformers should maximize the total degrees of freedom and achieve interference alignment in high snr . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the interference alignment problem in spatial domain and prove that the problem of maximizing the total degrees of freedom for a given mimo interference channel is np - hard . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that even checking the achievability of a given tuple of degrees of freedom for all receivers is np - hard when each receiver is equipped with at least three antennas . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the same problem becomes polynomial time solvable when each transmit / receive node is equipped with no more than two antennas . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose a distributed algorithm for transmit covariance matrix design , while assuming each receiver uses a linear mmse beamformer . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing interference alignment algorithms in terms of system throughput .    </S>",
