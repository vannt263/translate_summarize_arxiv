    "the crucial role of entanglement as a fundamental resource for quantum information tasks that transgress the classical limits is particularly evident and has been experimentally verified in such protocols like teleportation @xcite , cryptography and secure key distribution @xcite , and quantum communication @xcite . typically , the `` most natural way '' to create entanglement between parties is by means of direct interactions .",
    "since , intuitively , large amounts of entanglement should be associated to the presence of strong correlations , low - dimensional systems , as , for instance , spin chains , offer a natural source of entanglement . however , in most systems with short - range interactions , the entanglement between a pair of particles decays rapidly with the distance .",
    "for instance , in the ising model with transverse field @xcite the two - spin concurrence vanishes for distances larger than two neighboring sites , while in the heisenberg model @xcite , it is restricted only to single nearest neighbors . a first exception to this behavior",
    "was found by amico _",
    "et al _ @xcite , who established that close to factorization points , the range of entanglement grows indefinitely .",
    "however , in this case , the entanglement strength between two spins rapidly vanishes as the range increases .",
    "in fact , this behavior appears to be natural , recalling that monogamy of entanglement @xcite implies that if entanglement is enhanced between two given subsystems , then the entanglement between any of the two subsystems and a third one must necessarily be suppressed .    from a general quantum informatic perspective",
    ", a much desired goal would be the ability to create a large amount of entanglement between distant subsystems , simultaneously avoiding direct interactions between them and single - subsystem addressing . along this line of thought",
    ", the first requirement can be satisfied by introducing the concept of localizable entanglement , with the aim of exploiting spin chains as quantum channels @xcite .",
    "the localizable entanglement measures the average entanglement that can be concentrated on a pair of distant subsystems by performing optimal local measurements onto the rest of the system .",
    "more recently , it was shown that the ground state of some spin models with finite correlation length defined on one - dimensional chains with open ends can support large values of long - distance entanglement between the end points of the chain @xcite .",
    "this approach , i. e. to look for systems whose ground state can support long - distance entanglement _ prima facie _ , without the need of performing operations and measurements , is clearly very appealing .",
    "however , it appears that models which exhibit true long - distance entanglement are characterized by energy gaps above the ground state that vanish exponentially as the length of the chain is increased @xcite .",
    "hence , this interesting phenomenon seems doomed to survive only in the physically unattainable situation of zero temperature . in the effort to overcome this problem , it was shown that a kind of long - distance entanglement , very slowly decreasing with the length of the chain , can be supported by the ground state of spin models with infinite correlation length defined on one - dimensional open chains with small end bond interactions , and that these systems allow for robust finite - temperature teleportation across finite distances @xcite .",
    "this `` quasi long - distance entanglement '' between the end points of the chain is associated to an energy gap that vanishes algebraically with the size of the system . as a consequence , it is more resilient to thermal excitations , and can be used to engineer realistic protocols of qubit teleportation , as has been explicitly demonstrated , by numerical dmrg simulations , in the case of the heisenberg ( @xmath2 ) chain with small end interactions @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will show that both true long - distance and quasi long - distance entanglement can be supported by very simple isotropic @xmath0 models of open spin chains .",
    "these models present some interesting advantages over the ones that have been previously studied . at variance with the heisenberg case",
    ", they are amenable to exact analytical treatment both in the case of alternating couplings , corresponding to dimerization of the ground state and true long - distance entanglement , and in the case of small end bonds , corresponding to a ground state that supports quasi long - distance entanglement . in this way",
    ", one achieves a full grasp of the physical mechanism responsible for long and quasi - long distance entanglement , and the possibility to identify unambiguously the optimal range of parameters for teleportation with maximal fidelity .",
    "moreover , having in mind possible experimental realizations , for instance in suitably engineered optical lattices @xcite , @xmath0 chains are in principle more easily realizable or simulatable than heisenberg interactions .",
    "the exact solvability of the open - end @xmath0 chains is possible thanks the methods introduced by lieb and coworkers @xcite .",
    "we will first study the fully dimerized @xmath0 open spin chain with alternating couplings , discuss the exact behavior of the end - to - end concurrence in the ground state at zero temperature , and show analytically that for this kind of model the energy gap between the ground and the lowest excited state falls off exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "therefore , this system can not be exploited for quantum teleportation in realistic situations at finite temperature .",
    "we then study the @xmath0 open spin chain with small end bonds and determine analytically the exact expression for the zero temperature end - to - end concurrence in some physically relevant limits .",
    "we determine the exact scaling of the energy gap with the length of the chain and show that it dies off algebraically with the size of the system .",
    "finally , we determine the behavior of the teleportation fidelity as a function of the temperature for different strengths of the small end bonds , and show that qubit teleportation with fidelities well above the classical threshold , and in some cases close to unity , is supported even at moderately low temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the general @xmath0 spin chain hamiltonian with arbitrary site - dependent couplings , and solve it analytically for the end - to - end two - point reduced density matrix , correlation , and concurrence ( entanglement of formation ) .",
    "we calculate the fully entangled fraction and establish the analytical expression for the fidelity of teleportation of an unknown qubit state between the two end points of the chain . in section iii",
    "we specialize the model to the case of perfectly alternating couplings and fully dimerized ground state .",
    "we determine the single particle dispersion law , establish the exponential scaling behavior of the energy gap , and determine the analytical expressions for the ground state end - to - end concurrence and fidelity .",
    "we show that , depending on the values of the coupling strength , high or even maximal entanglement and fidelity can be achieved for chains of arbitrary length . in section",
    "iv we turn to the case of open @xmath0 chains with small end bonds , establishing the single particle dispersion law , the algebraic scaling of the energy gap , and the analytic expressions for the concurrence and the fidelity .",
    "we then investigate the behavior of the end - to - end teleportation fidelity as a function of the temperature for different values of the small end bonds , and conclude that teleportation with unit fidelity at very low temperature and with high fidelity above the classical threshold at moderately low temperature are both supported by the @xmath0 channel with small end bonds .",
    "finally , in the conclusions we summarize our findings and discuss some outlooks on possible future developments along this line of research .",
    "as already anticipated in the introduction , we will focus our analysis on one - dimensional lattices with open ends , described by @xmath0 models with different types of nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "such models are all special instances of the general @xmath0 hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the interaction strength between nearest neighboring sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the spin operators defined at site @xmath5 , and @xmath8 is the total number of sites ( spins ) or the length of the chain . the spectrum of this hamiltonian can be determined exactly by a straightforward application of the standard methods introduced in ref .",
    "the first step in the procedure is to perform a jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 . as a result",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianagenerica ] ) is mapped in the free fermion hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the vector of the @xmath8 creation ( annihilation ) operators , one for each site of the lattice , and the adjacency matrix @xmath14 reads @xmath15 we will investigate two particular realizations of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianagenerica ] ) that , as we will show , in the ground state allow for high or even maximal entanglement between the end spins of the chain , and thus naturally provide a channel with high or even unit fidelity for qubit teleportation . to evaluate the teleportation fidelity , one needs to determine the spin - spin concurrence ( entanglement of formation ) between the end points of the chain .",
    "this quantity can be computed exactly for any two - qubit state ( pure or mixed ) , thanks to the celebrated formula of wootters @xcite , and the task is left to obtain its explicit expression in the reduced state of the two end - point spins . to this purpose",
    ", we need to calculate explicitly all the possible forms of two - point correlations in the ground state .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianagenerica ] ) is symmetric under rotations of the spins around the @xmath16-axis , so that the only nonvanishing correlations are @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the absence of external magnetic fields , @xmath20-rotations around the @xmath21 and @xmath22 axes",
    "are symmetries of the model , which additionally implies @xmath23 at every site .",
    "thanks to the aforementioned symmetries , the two - point reduced density matrix @xmath24 , obtained by tracing the full density matrix of the system over all sites except the pair @xmath25 , has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the pauli matrices and @xmath28 is the ground state average at temperature @xmath29 , or the thermal one at finite temperature @xmath30 with respect to the gibbs state @xmath31 .",
    "we are interested in the case in which @xmath5 and @xmath32 are the two end points of the chain . in this instance , we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total number operator . using wick s theorem and taking into account that @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath36 setting @xmath37 we see that the end - to - end reduced density matrix depends uniquely on this parameter .",
    "all the physical informations about model ( [ trasformata ] ) can now be obtained by diagonalizing the one - body matrix @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath38 be the eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a quasi - momentum label . then , passing to new fermionic operators via the transformation @xmath41 , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath42 the evaluation of the two - point correlation @xmath21 is then straightforward , and one obtains @xmath43 for reduced states of the form ( [ reduceddensity ] ) , the end to end concurrence is easily computed , and we have @xcite @xmath44 the above expression of the concurrence is nonvanishing for @xmath45 , and it reaches the maximum value @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "it is natural to expect that the existence of a strong quantum correlation between the two end spins of the chain can be conveniently exploited for performing tasks in quantum information , in particular considering teleportation schemes . in the standard quantum teleportation protocol",
    ", two parties a and b share a maximally entangled state ( bell state ) .",
    "party a holds also a third qubit , whose unknown state is to be teleported . if the two end points of our @xmath0 chain share a highly entangled state , that in some limit may even be asymptotically close to a bell state , they can be identified as the two parties , sender and receiver , for a long - distance , high - fidelity teleportation protocol .",
    "the efficiency of a quantum channel in teleporting an unknown state is quantified by the fidelity @xmath48 between the output and the input states , averaged over all input realizations .",
    "the fidelity depends on the actual properties of the entangled resource @xmath49 ( cfr .",

    "@xmath58 choosing @xmath8 even and @xmath57 assures that the spins at the end of the chain interact with a weak bond of strength @xmath55 with their respective neighbors .",
    "let us first comment on the general features of the model ( [ ldehamiltonian ] ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for @xmath59 the model in the fermionic picture reduces to a simple tight binding with dispersion @xmath60 .",

    "two bands develop with dispersion @xmath62 upon increasing the value of @xmath61 , the growing difference between the alternating coupling constants allows the creation of dimers between pairs of strongly interacting spins .",
    "the dimers , in turn , are very weakly interacting with each other . hence , because the two end spins of the chain interact very weakly with their nearest neighbors , dimerization and monogamy of entanglement force the creation of a strong quantum correlation between the end points , in analogy with what happens in the heisenberg case @xcite .    the above qualitative picture can be supplemented by a detailed quantitative analysis both in the thermodynamic limit and at finite length @xmath8 .",

    ", one sees that the behavior of the teleportation fidelity as a function of the temperature in the two models is qualitatively similar .",
    "this fact is of relevance , because it shows that the qlde due to the presence of weakly interacting probes at the and of a uniformly interacting chain is an effect not restricted to a particular hamiltonian model , but can be supported by systems endowed with different bulk interactions and different symmetries .",
    "the only important ingredient for the realization of a qlde and a teleportation channel that are robust against thermal fluctuations is the availability of efficient control on the interactions at the end points of the channel .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn about lde : in this work we have demonstrated that existence of true lde at zero temperature is a phenomenon not restricted to a particular model and , in fact , does not crucially depend on the mechanism of dimerization .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that gapped , anisotropic models in non critical regimes can sustain lde even in the absence of a clear pattern of dimerization .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that even if the heisenberg model with small end bonds analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite sustains a teleportation fidelity that remains above the classical threshold for larger values of the end coupling parameter @xmath106 , the @xmath0 channel with small end bonds assures teleportation with nonclassical fidelities for larger values of the temperature . depending on the realistic experimental settings , if the temperature can be controlled down to sufficiently low values , it is more convenient to engineer a channel based on the heisenberg - like hamiltonian proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . otherwise ,",
    "if control on the external temperature can not be implemented with high precision down to sufficiently low temperatures , it may then turn out more convenient to engineer @xmath0 chains of the type discussed in the present paper .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied models of open quantum spin chains endowed with @xmath0-like hamiltonians with nearest - neighbor interactions . we have discussed two types of models , according to different engineerings of the spin - spin couplings . in the first case",
    "considered , a chain with bonds of alternating strengths , we have shown how the exact solution for the ground state implies the existence of long - distance entanglement between the end spins of the chain , independent of the size of the system and asymptotically close to unity ( maximal entanglement ) in the limit of exact dimerization .",
    "this system is therefore perfectly suited for _ bona fide _ long - distance quantum teleportation with ideal fidelity at zero temperature .",
    "however , the limiting maximal values of the fidelity are obtained for an exponentially small energy gap above the ground state .",
    "therefore , this system is _ de facto _",
    "useless for efficient quantum teleportation at finite temperature .",
    "we have then moved on to discuss another class of @xmath0 open spin chains with uniform bulk interactions and small end bonds . in this case",
    ", we have shown that for sufficiently small values of the end couplings , the ground state of the system supports a quasi long - distance entanglement between the end spins of the chain , asymptotically close to unity ( maximal entanglement ) in the limit of vanishing coupling , but slowly decreasing as the length of the chain is increased .",
    "an interesting feature of this model is that the lowest energy gap above the ground state vanishes only algebraically , as the first power of the inverse of the size of the system .",
    "therefore , in principle , it can be exploited as a quantum channel for teleportation with nonclassical fidelity at finite temperature , both very low and moderately low .",
    "considering future research along these lines of investigation , it will be interesting to consider practical schemes for the realization of this kind of spin chains in highly controllable situations , for instance resorting to ultracold atomic mixtures in optical lattices .",
    "another interesting open problem worth further study is to assess the existence and the possible location of a crossover between true long - distance and _ prima facie _ quasi long - distance entanglement behaviors .",
