    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) is a mixture of thermal and non - thermal components and a precise physical description of the icm also requires adequate knowledge of the role of non - thermal components .",
    "the most detailed evidence for non - thermal phenomena comes from the radio observations .",
    "a number of clusters of galaxies are known to contain wide diffuse synchrotron sources ( radio halos and relics ) which have no obvious connection with the individual cluster galaxies , but are rather associated to the icm ( e.g. , giovannini & feretti 2000 ; kempner & sarazin 2001 ; see giovannini & feretti 2002 for a review ) .",
    "the synchrotron emission of such sources requires a population of gev relativistic electrons ( and/or positrons ) and cluster magnetic fields on @xmath3 g levels .",
    "evidence for relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) in the icm may also come from the detection of hard x - ray ( hxr ) excess emission in the case of a few galaxy clusters ( e.g. , rephaeli & gruber 2003 , fusco  femiano et al . 2004 ) , and possibly from extreme ultra - violet ( euv ) excess emission ( e.g. , kaastra et al .",
    "2003 ; bowyer et al .",
    "it is also believed that the amount of the energy budget of high energy protons in the icm might be significant , due to the confinement of cosmic rays over cosmological time scales ( vlk et al .",
    "1996 ; berezinsky , blasi & ptuskin 1997 ; enlin et al .",
    "nevertheless , the gamma radiation that would allow to infer the fraction of relativistic hadrons in clusters has not been detected as yet ( reimer et al .",
    ", 2003 , see pfrommer & enlin 2004 for upper limit on this fraction ) .",
    "shock waves are unavoidably formed during merger events ; they may efficiently accelerate relativistic particles contributing to the injection of relativistic hadrons and of relativistic emitting electrons in the icm ( e.g. , ryu et al .",
    "2003 , gabici & blasi 2003 ) .",
    "however the accelerated electrons have a short pathlength due to ic losses and thus they can travel a short distance away from the shock front , emitting synchrotron radiation concentrated around the shock rim ( e.g. , miniati et al .",
    "radio relics , which are polarized and elongated radio sources located in the cluster peripheral regions , may indeed be associated to these shock waves , as a result of fermi - i diffusive shock acceleration of icm electrons ( enlin et al . 1998 ; roettiger et al .",
    "1999 ) , or of adiabatic energization of relativistic electrons confined in fossil radio plasma , released in the past by active radio galaxies ( enlin & gopal - krishna 2001 ; hoeft et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the most spectacular evidence of diffuse synchrotron emission in galaxy clusters is that associated to giant radio halos , mpc - size radio sources which permeate the cluster volume similarly to the x  ray emitting gas . in this respect ,",
    "two main possibilities have been investigated in some detail to explain that gev electrons ( and/or positrons ) are present and able to radiate on distance scales larger than their typical loss lengths : _",
    "i ) _ the so - called _ reacceleration _ models , whereby relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) injected in the icm by a variety of processes active during the life of galaxy clusters are continuously re - energized _ in situ _ during the life ",
    "time of the observed radio halos ( which is estimated to be @xmath10 gyr , kuo et al .",
    "2004 ) and _ ii ) _ the _ secondary electron _ models , whereby electrons are secondary products of the hadronic interactions of cosmic rays with the intracluster medium , as first proposed by dennison ( 1980 ) .",
    "although the origin of the emitting particles in radio halos is still a matter of debate ( e.g. , enlin 2004 ) , the above two models for the production of the radiating electrons ( and positrons ) have a substantial predictive power , which can be used to discriminate among such models by comparing their predictions with observations .",
    "although future observations remain crucial to achieve a firm conclusion , at least as far as the few well studied clusters and the analysis of statistical samples are concerned , present data seem to suggest the presence of _ in situ _ particle  reacceleration mechanisms active in the icm ( e.g. , brunetti 2003,04 ; blasi 2004 ; feretti et al . 2004 ; hwang 2004 ; reimer et al . 2004 ) .",
    "radio observations of galaxy clusters indicate that the detection rate of radio halos shows an abrupt increase with increasing the x - ray luminosity of the host clusters .",
    "in particular , about 30 - 35% of the galaxy clusters with x - ray luminosity larger than @xmath11 erg / s show diffuse non - thermal radio emission ( giovannini & feretti 2002 ) ; these clusters have also high temperature ( kt @xmath12 7 kev ) and large mass ( @xmath13 2@xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",
    "furthermore , giant radio halos are always found in merging clusters ( e.g. , buote 2001 ; schuecker et al 2001 ) .",
    "although the physics of particle acceleration due to turbulence generated in merging clusters has been investigated in some detail ( e.g. , schlickeiser et al .  1987 ;",
    "petrosian 2001 ; fujita et al 2003 ; brunetti et al .  2004 ;",
    "brunetti & blasi 2005 ) and the model expectations seem to reproduce the observed radio features and possibly also the hard x  rays ( e.g. , brunetti et al .  2001 ; kuo et al .",
    "2003 ; brunetti 2004 ; hwang 2004 ) , a theoretical investigation of the statistical properties of the mpc diffuse emission in galaxy clusters in the framework of these models has not been carried out extensively as yet . in particular , the fact that giant radio halos are always associated to massive galaxy clusters and the presence of a trend between their radio power and the mass ( temperature , x - ray luminosity ) of the parent clusters may be powerful tools to test and constrain present models .    in a recent paper cassano & brunetti ( 2005 ; hereafter cb05 ) have modelled the statistical properties of giant radio halos in the framework of the merger  induced _ in situ _ particle acceleration scenario . by adopting the semi  analytic press & schechter ( 1974 ; ps74 ) theory to follow the cosmic evolution and formation of a large synthetic population of galaxy clusters , it was assumed that the energy injected in the form of magnetosonic waves during merging events in clusters is a fraction , @xmath16 , of the @xmath17 work done by the infalling subclusters in passing through the most massive one .",
    "then the processes of stochastic acceleration of the relativistic electrons by these waves , and the ensuing synchrotron emission properties , have been worked out under the assumption that the magnetic field intensities , icm temperatures and particle densities ( both thermal and non - thermal ) have constant volume averaged values ( within 1 mpc@xmath18 ) .",
    "the main findings of these calculations is that giant radio halos are _ naturally _ expected only in the more massive clusters , and the expected fraction of clusters with radio halos ( at redshifts @xmath19 ) can be reconciled with the observed one under viable assumptions ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "specifically , the probability to form giant radio halos in the synthetic cluster population was found to be of order 20 - 30 % in the more massive galaxy clusters ( @xmath21 ) , 2 - 5 % in @xmath22 clusters , and negligible in less massive systems .",
    "such increase of the probability with the cluster mass is essentially due to the increase of both the energy density of turbulence and of the turbulence injection volume with cluster mass ( see cb05 ) .",
    "the present paper is a natural extension of the cb05 work , the most important difference being that here we adopt a scaling law between the rms magnetic field strength ( averaged in the synchrotron emitting volume ) and the virial mass of the parent clusters , @xmath23 .",
    "we carry out a detailed comparison between statistical data of giant radio halos currently available and model expectations as derived by adopting the cb05 procedures .    in sec .",
    "2 we collect radio and x - ray data for well known giant radio halos from the literature and derive radio  x - ray correlations . in sec .",
    "3 we investigate the possibility to match the observed radio  x - ray correlations for giant radio halos with electron acceleration models .",
    "this comparison provides stringent constraints on the physical parameters in the icm , in particular for the magnetic field in galaxy clusters . in sec .",
    "4 we derive the expected probability to form giant radio halos as a function of @xmath24 and z. this is done by adopting the same values of the physical parameters which allows to account for the observed radio  x - ray correlations . in secs.56",
    "we finally calculate the expected luminosity functions and number counts of giant radio halos .    as in cb05",
    ", we focus our attention on giant radio halos only ( linear size @xmath81 @xmath25 mpc , grhs elsewhere ) . the adopted cosmology is : @xmath26cdm ( @xmath27 km @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the observed correlations between the x - ray and the radio properties of clusters hosting grhs .    we collect galaxy clusters with known grhs from the literature obtaining a total sample of 17 clusters . in tab .",
    "[ rh ] we report the radio and x - ray properties of this sample in a @xmath26cdm cosmology . in order to have the best estimate of the x - ray temperatures we select results from xmm - newton observations when available , otherwise we use asca results or combine asca and chandra information .",
    "we investigate the correlations between the x - ray and the radio properties of the selected clusters by making use of a linear regression fit in log - log space following the procedures given in akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) .",
    "this method allows for intrinsic scatter and errors in both variables .",
    "the presence of a correlation between the radio powers and the x - ray luminosities is well known ( liang et al .",
    "2000 ; feretti 2000 , 2003 ; enlin and rttgering 2002 ) .    in fig.[lxlrfig ]",
    "we report the correlation between the x - ray luminosity ( in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy band ) and the radio power at 1.4 ghz ( @xmath33 ) for our sample of grhs .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      since the temperature is related to the cluster mass , the radio power ",
    "mass correlation also implies a correlation between synchrotron radio power and cluster temperature .",
    "thus , in order to maximize the observational constraints , an analysis similar to that of sect .",
    "3.1 can also be done for the radio power ",
    "temperature correlation ( @xmath37 ) . combining eq .",

    "the asymptotic behaviors of eq .",
    "[ ptpre ] are given by @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "as in sec.3.1 , here we can adopt the same scaling with t for both @xmath49 and @xmath33 and compare the values of the expected slope with those of the observed one .",
    "we can calculate the slope @xmath50 of the @xmath51 correlation between two points as :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 define the interval of temperature of our sample , @xmath55 kev is the mean temperature , and @xmath56 is evaluated at @xmath57 . in fig .",
    "[ slopet ] we report the slope @xmath50 of the @xmath51 correlation as a function of the magnetic field strength in a average cluster , @xmath58 .",
    "the different curves are obtained for different scaling - laws of the cluster magnetic fields with mass ( i.e. , temperature ) ( b=0.5 to 1.7 ) .",
    "dashed lines are for @xmath59 and continuous lines are for the virial case .",
    "the horizontal blue lines mark the lower limit @xmath60 and the upper limit @xmath61 of the observed correlation .",
    "[ slopet ] shows that there is a range of values of the parameters ( @xmath62 ) for which the model is consistent with the observed slope .",
    "the relevant point is that , similarly to the case of the @xmath63 correlations , also in this case values of @xmath48 can not be reconciled with observations : a clear upper boundary at @xmath64 g is obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "we combine the results obtained from the observed correlations ( both @xmath65 and @xmath51 ) and the model expected trends to selects the allowed region of the ( @xmath58 , @xmath66 ) parameters .",
    "we consider the slope of the @xmath51 correlation @xmath67 as derived for the extended sample of 24 galaxy clusters with giant and small radio halos .",
    "this is because what is important here is the allowed lower bound of the values of @xmath50 which does not depend on the adopted sample ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) .    in fig.[regions ] we report the region of the plane ( @xmath62 ) allowed by the observed slopes at 1@xmath68 level .",
    "the lower bound of the ( @xmath58,b ) region is due to the @xmath65 correlation while the upper bound is mostly due to the @xmath51 correlation which is poorly constrained because of the very large statistical errors .",
    "this bound is however also limited by the @xmath65 correlation ( fig.[regions ] , dashed line ) .    an additional limit on @xmath58 , also reported in fig.[regions ] ( vertical arrows ) , can be obtained from inverse compton ( ic ) arguments .",
    "indeed a lower bound to the magnetic field strength can be inferred in order to not overproduce , via ic scattering of the photons of the cmb radiation , the hard - x ray excess fluxes observed up to now in a few clusters ( e.g. , rephaeli & gruber 2003 , fusco - femiano et al 2003 ) . in this case",
    "the value of the mean magnetic field intensity in the cluster volume can be estimated from the ratio between the hard - x ray and radio emission .",
    "the resulting value of the magnetic field should be considered as a lower limit because the ic emission may come from more external region with respect to the synchrotron emission ( e.g. , brunetti et al .",
    "2001 , kuo et al .",
    "2003 , colafrancesco et al .",
    "2005b ) and also because , in principle , additional mechanisms may contribute to the hard - x ray fluxes ( e.g. , fusco - femiano et al .",
    "one of the best studied cases is that of the coma cluster for which an average magnetic field intensity of the order of @xmath69 was derived ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "2004 ) . as a first approximation we can use this value to obtain the lower bound of b for each cluster mass from the scaling @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting ( @xmath58,@xmath66 ) region spans a wide range of values of b and b. an inspection of fig.[regions ] immediately identifies two allowed regimes : a super - linear scaling ( @xmath71 ) with relatively high values of b and a sub - linear scaling ( @xmath72 ) with lower values of b.    all the calculations we will report in the following sections are carried out by assuming representative values of ( @xmath58,@xmath66 ) inside the constrained region ( fig .  [ regions ] coloured filled dots and tab.[choose_value ] ) .",
    "in this section we derive the probability with cluster mass to find grhs in the redshift range @xmath73=00.2 . the byproduct of the section is to calibrate the model by requiring that the expected fraction of cluster with grhs is consistent with the observational constraints .",
    "this allows to select a range of values of the parameter @xmath16 , which is the ratio between the energy injected in the form of magnetosonic waves and the @xmath17 work done by the infalling subclusters in passing through the most massive one .",
    "@xmath16 is a free parameter in our calculations since the fraction of the energy which goes into the form of compressible modes is likely to depend on the details of the driving force .    in the conservative case of solenoidal forcing ( and beta of plasma",
    "@xmath74 1 ) this fraction is expected to scale with @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 , the turbulent mach number ) for @xmath77 and with a flatter slope for larger values ( bertoglio et al .",
    "2001 ) . assuming a reynolds number ( at the injection scale , hundreds of kpc ) in hot and magnetized galaxy clusters @xmath78 ( see discussion in lazarian 2006 ; brunetti 2006 ) and a turbulent energy of the order of @xmath8 20% of the thermal energy ( cb05 ) , from fig .  8 in bertoglio",
    "2001 ) one finds a reference value @xmath79 which may be even larger in the case of compressible driving .",
    "radio halos are identified with those objects in a synthetic cluster population with a synchrotron break frequency ( eq.[nub ] ) @xmath80 mhz in a region of 1 @xmath81 @xmath25 size . in cb05",
    "it was assumed that the magnetic field in the radio halo volume is independent from the cluster mass and it is @xmath82 . then @xmath83 and",
    "consequently massive clusters are expected to be favourite in forming grhs .",
    "cb05 indeed showed that the expected fraction of clusters with grhs naturally shows an abrupt increase with cluster mass , and that the observed fractions ( 20 - 30 % for @xmath21 clusters , 2 - 5 % for @xmath22 clusters and negligible for less massive objects ) can be well reconciled with the model expectations by assuming @xmath84 .",
    "in the present paper we assume that the rms magnetic field depends on the cluster mass and this should affect the synchrotron break frequency ( eq .  [ nub ] ) and the occurrence of grhs with cluster mass . on the other hand , in sect .",
    "3.3 we have also shown that the comparison between the expected and observed trends between radio power and cluster mass ( and temperature ) helps in constraining the range of values which can be assigned to the magnetic field in clusters .",
    "thus our calculations of the occurrence of grhs ( @xmath85 ) and the selection of the values of @xmath16 necessary to reproduce the observations should be performed within the dashed region in fig.[regions ] .    to calculate the expected probabilities to form radio halos we first run a large number , @xmath86 , of trees for different cluster masses at @xmath87 , ranging from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "then we choose different mass bins @xmath90 and redshift bins @xmath91 in which to perform our calculations .",
    "thus , for each mass @xmath92 , we estimate the formation probability of grhs in the mass bin @xmath90 and in the redshift bin @xmath91 as ( cb05 ) :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the time in the redshift interval @xmath91 that the cluster spends in the mass bin @xmath90 with @xmath95mhz and @xmath96 is the time that the same cluster spends in @xmath90 with @xmath97 mhz .",
    "the total probability of formation of grhs in the mass bin @xmath90 and in the redshift bin @xmath91 is obtained by combining all the contributions ( eq .  [ partialrate ] ) weighted with the present day mass function of clusters given by the press & schecther mass function .    to have a prompt comparison with present observational constraints",
    ", we calculate the probability to form grhs at @xmath98 in the two observed mass bins : bin i ( @xmath99\\times 10^{15 } m_{\\odot}$ ] ) and bin ii ( @xmath100\\times 10^{15 } m_{\\odot}$ ] ) .",
    "as an example , in fig .  [ exa ]",
    "we report these probabilities in both bin i and bin ii as a function of @xmath16 for three representative cases which nicely sample the region in fig.[regions ] : @xmath101 , @xmath102 g ( blue points ) ; @xmath103 , @xmath104 g ( black points ) ; @xmath105 , @xmath106 g ( cyan points ) ; @xmath107 , @xmath108 g ( green points ) .    the bottom shadowed region in fig .",
    "[ exa ] marks the observed probability for grhs in the mass bin i while the top shadowed region marks that in the mass bin ii .",
    "[ exa ] shows that it is possible to find a range of values of the parameter @xmath16 for which the theoretical expectations are consistent with the observed statistics in both the mass bins .",
    "however we note that the requirement in terms of energy of the ms modes increases with decreasing the magnetic field : it goes from @xmath109 for intermediate ",
    "large values of @xmath4 up to @xmath110 at the lower bound of the allowed @xmath4 strengths .",
    "the fact that the magnetic field depends on the cluster mass is reflected in the different behavior that the various selected configurations of parameters may have in fig .",
    "[ exa ] in the two mass bins : one configuration of parameters may be favoured in a mass bin with respect to another configuration but disfavoured in the other mass bin .",
    "this is related to the transition from ic dominance ( @xmath111 ) to synchrotron dominance ( @xmath112 ) that occurs in going from the bin i to the more massive clusters of bin ii . in the case of ic dominance an increase of @xmath4",
    "does not significantly affect the particle energy losses , it causes an increase of @xmath113 ( eq.[nub ] ) and thus an increase of the probability to have grhs . on the other hand , in the case of synchrotron dominance the particle energy losses increase and consequently @xmath113 decreases ( eq.[nub ] ) as well as the probability to form grhs .",
    "for this reason , given @xmath16 , the ratio between the probability to form grhs in the bin i and in the bin ii is expected to decrease with increasing b , as larger values of @xmath66 yield a more rapid increase of b with cluster mass ( fig.[exa ] ) .    in tab.[choose_value ] we report the maximum and the minimum values of @xmath16 ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) for which the model reproduces the observed probabilities ( 1 @xmath68 limits ) in both the mass bins .",
    "the results are given for the relevant ( @xmath62 ) configurations reported in fig .",
    "[ regions ] . in agreement with the above discussions",
    ", one might notice that in the case of ic dominance a larger magnetic field implies a smaller energetic request ( smaller @xmath114 ) .      in this section",
    "we calculate the expected probability to form grhs with cluster mass without restricting ourselves to the mass bins considered by present observations ( bin i and bin ii in fig .",
    "[ exa ] ) and calculate the evolution of this probability with redshift . in doing these calculations we use the values of @xmath16 as constrained in tab.[choose_value ] within the region ( @xmath58,b ) of fig.[regions ] , and make the viable ( and necessary ) assumption that the value of @xmath16 ( i.e. , efficiency of turbulence in going into ms modes ) is constant with redshift .",
    "a detailed calculation of the acceleration efficiency and of the probability to have grhs requires detailed montecarlo calculations ( see sec .",
    "6 of cb05 ) essentially because at each redshift the acceleration is driven by ms modes injected in the icm from the mergers that the cluster experienced in the last few gyr at that redshift . however , to readily understand the model results reported in the following , we may use the simplified formula eq .",
    "( [ nub ] ) which describes the approximate trend of the break frequency with cluster mass .",
    "the scaling @xmath116 adopted in this paper implies that the synchrotron losses overcome the ic losses first in the more massive objects .",
    "clusters of smaller mass in our synthetic populations have @xmath117 and this implies ( eq.[nub ] ) @xmath118 so that the probability to form grhs in these clusters increases with the cluster mass ( @xmath119 always ) and decreases with redshift . in the case of more massive clusters",
    "the situation may be more complicated .",

    "as a consequence , the general picture is that going from smaller to larger masses , the probability should reach a max value around @xmath125 for which @xmath124 , and then it should start to smoothly decrease .",

    "this flattening is a unique feature of particle acceleration models since it marks the effect of the decrease of the efficiency of the particles acceleration ( in 1 mpc @xmath25 cube ) in the case of the less massive galaxy clusters .",
    "we stress that this result does not depend on the particular choice of the parameters .    to highlight the result , in fig.[rhlf_noi_ens ] we also compare our rhlfs with the range of local @xmath156 ( black solid lines ) reported by enlin & r@xmath157ttgering ( 2002 ) .",
    "these @xmath156 are obtained by combining the x - ray luminosity function of clusters with the radio - x - ray correlation for grhs and assuming that a costant fraction , @xmath158 , of galaxy clusters have grhs independently from the cluster mass ( see enlin & r@xmath157ttgering 2002 ) .",
    "the most important difference between the two expectations is indeed that a low - radio power cut - off does not show up in the @xmath156 in which indeed the bulk of grhs is expected at very low radio powers .",
    "the agreement between the two local rhlfs at higher synchrotron powers is essentially because the derived occurrence of grhs in massive objects ( sect .",

    "this difference is driven by the probability to form grhs as a function of redshift in the two cases : in the super  linear case the probability to form grhs does not decrease rapidly with @xmath73 , while a rapid decrease of such a probability is obtained in the sub  linear case ( see also figs .",

    "the combination of these configurations define a bundle of expected rhlfs which determines the range of the possible rhlfs .",
    "all the calculations are performed for the corresponding range of values of @xmath16 which allow to be consistent with the observed probability to form radio halos at @xmath159 .",
    "one finds that with increasing redshift the bundle of the rhlfs broadens along the @xmath160 axis .",
    "this is again due to the different evolutions of the probability to form grhs with @xmath73 of the super  linear and sub  linear cases .",
    "in this section we derive the expected number counts of giant radio halos ( rhncs ) .",
    "this will allow us to perform a first comparison between the model expectations and the counts of grhs which can be derived from present observations , but also to derive expectations for future observations .",
    "as for the case of the rhlfs , in calculating the rhncs we adopt the configurations of parameters which allow to reproduce the observed probabilities of grhs at @xmath129 .",
    "however , we point out that the fact that our expectations are consistent with the observed probability to form grhs at @xmath19 does not imply that they should also be consistent with the observed flux distribution of grhs in the same redshift interval .",
    "given the rhlfs ( @xmath161 ) the number of grhs with @xmath162 is given by :    @xmath163    where @xmath164 is the comoving volume element in the @xmath26cdm cosmology ( e.g. , carroll , press and turner 1992 ) ; the radio flux and the radio power are related by @xmath165 with @xmath166 the luminosity distance ( where we neglect the k - correction since the slope of the spectrum of radio halos is close to unity ) .",
    "as a first step , we use eq .",

    "1998 ) . by adopting a typical size of grh of the order of 1 mpc , the surface brightness of the objects which populate the peak of the rhlfs ( @xmath169 w / hz ) at z@xmath80.15 is expected to fall below the 2@xmath68 limit of the nvss .",
    "these grhs have a flux of about 20 mjy , thus below this flux the nvss becomes poorly efficient in catching the bulk of grhs in the redshift bin z=00.2 and a fair comparison with observations is not possible . for larger fluxes",
    "we find that the expected number counts are in excellent agreement with the counts obtained from the observations .",
    "we note that assuming a superlinear scaling of @xmath4 with cluster mass , up to 30 - 40 grhs at @xmath129 are expected to be discovered with future deeper radio surveys . on the other hand , the number of these grhs in the case of a sublinear scaling should only be a factor of @xmath170 larger than that of presently known halos .    as a second step ,",
    "we calculate ( fig.[conteggi_z06_f ] ) the whole sky number of grhs expected up @xmath171 ( the probability to form grhs at @xmath172 is negligible ) .",
    "we note that the number counts of grhs increases down to a radio flux    of @xmath173 mjy and then flattens due to the strong ( negative ) evolution of the rhlfs ( fig .",
    "[ rhlf_flat_z ] ) .",
    "we note that the expected total number of grhs above 1 mjy at 1.4 ghz is of the order of @xmath174 depending on the scaling of the magnetic field with cluster mass .",
    "finally we calculate the expected number counts of grhs above a given radio flux in different redshift bins .",
    "this allows us to catch the redshift at which the bulk of grhs is expected . in fig .",
    "[ conteggi_z06 ] we report the rhncs integrated above 5 mjy ( panel a ) ) and above 30 mjy ( panel b ) ) .",
    "we note that the bulk of grhs is expected in the redshift interval @xmath175 and this does not strongly depend on the flux limit .",
    "we note that the relatively high value of such redshift range is also due to the presence of the low radio power cut - off in the rhlfs which suppresses the expected number of low power grhs . on the other hand , at radio fluxes @xmath12 30 mjy the contribution from higher redshift decreases since",
    "the requested radio luminosities at these redshift correspond to masses of the parent clusters which are above the high  mass cut - off of the cluster mass function .",
    "due to their steep radio - spectra , grhs are ideal targets for upcoming low - frequency radio telescopes , such as lofar and lwa . in this section",
    "we present calculations of the statistics of grhs at 150 mhz derived from the electron reacceleration model .    for simplicity , we present these results only for one set of the parameters in the plane ( @xmath62 ) ( fig.[regions ] ) : a super - linear case ( b=1.5 , @xmath176 g ) ( see sec.3 ) .",
    "first , we calculate the probability to have grhs at @xmath177 mhz as a function of the cluster s mass following the procedure outlined in sec.4.1 and requiring a break frequency @xmath178 mhz to account for the observation frequency . in fig.[lofar]a",
    "we report the probability to have grhs as a function of virial mass in two redshift bins at 1.4 ghz ( thin lines ) and at 150 mhz ( thick lines ) .",
    "as expected , the probability at 150 mhz is substantially larger than that calculated at 1.4 ghz , particularly for higher redshifts and for low massive clusters .",
    "one of the main findings of our work is the presence of a cut - off in the rhlfs at low radio powers ( see sec.5 ) , which reflects the drop of the probability to form grhs as the cluster s mass decreases . in fig.[lofar]b",
    "we plot the mass functions of radio halos ( rhmfs ) at 1.4 ghz and at 150 mhz in two redshift bins ( see caption of fig.[lofar ] ) .",
    "we note that the number density of grhs is increased by only a factor @xmath170 for @xmath179 , but by more than one order of magnitude for @xmath180 .",
    "the most interesting feature is again the presence of a low mass cut - off in the rhmfs at 150 mhz , which however is shifted by a factor @xmath170 towards smaller masses with respect to the case at 1.4 ghz .",
    "this is related to the fact that a smaller energy density in the form of turbulence is sufficient to boost grhs at lower frequencies , and this allows the formation of grhs also in slightly smaller clusters , which indeed are expected to be less turbulent ( cb05 ; see also vazza et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "finally , in order to obtain estimates for the rhlfs and rhncs at 150 mhz , we tentatively assume the same @xmath181 scaling found at 1.4 ghz , scaled at 150 mhz with an average spectral index @xmath182 , and follow the approach outlined in secs .  5 and 6 . in fig.[lofar]c we report the expected integral number counts of radio halos from a full sky coverage above a given radio flux at 1.4 ghz ( thin lines ) and at 150 mhz ( thick lines ) up to a redshift @xmath183 .",
    "the expected number of grhs at 150 mhz are a factor of @xmath184 larger than the number expected at 1.4 ghz , with the bulk of grhs at fluxes @xmath185 few mjy . in the near future lofar",
    "will be able to detect diffuse emission on mpc scale at 150 mhz down to these fluxes and this would be sufficient to catch the bulk of these grhs ( a more detailed study will be presented in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "the observed correlations between radio and x - ray properties of galaxy clusters provide useful tools to constraining the physical parameters that are relevant to the reacceleration models for the onset of giant radio halos ( grhs ) .",
    "our analysis is based on the calculations of cassano & brunetti ( 2005 ; cb05 ) , which assumes that a seed population of relativistic electrons reaccelerated by magnetosonic ( ms ) waves is released in the icm by relatively recent merger events . to this end",
    "we have collected from the literature a sample of 17 grh clusters for all of which , but one ( a2254 ) , both radio and x - ray homogeneous data are available , as summarized in tab.1 & 2 .",
    "based on the relationships derived in cb05 paper , we have been able to constrain the ( likely ) dependence of the average magnetic field intensity ( b ) on the cluster mass , under the assumption that b can be parameterized as @xmath186 ( with @xmath58 the average field intensity of a cluster of mean mass @xmath187 and b positive ) .",
    "this is an important achievement because both the emitted synchrotron spectrum and losses depend critically on the field intensity .",
    "following cb05 approach , the merger events are obtained in the statistical scenario provided by the extended press & schechter formalism that describes the hierarchical formation of galaxy clusters .",
    "the main results of our study can be summarized as follows :    * _ observed correlations _ + in sect.2 we derive the correlations between the radio power at 1.4 ghz ( @xmath33 ) and the x - ray luminosity ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) , icm temperature and cluster mass .",
    "most important for the purpose of the present investigation is the @xmath65 correlation which has been derived by combining the @xmath188 correlation obtained for a large statistical sample of galaxy clusters ( the hiflugcs sample plus our sample ) with the @xmath189 correlation derived for our sample of grhs .",
    "this procedure allows us to avoid the well known uncertainties and limits which are introduced in measuring the masses of small samples of galaxy clusters , especially in the case of merging systems .",
    "we find a value of the slope @xmath154 ( @xmath190 )",
    ". a steep correlation of the synchrotron luminosity with the icm temperature is also found , although with a large statistical error in the determination of the slope : @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "+ in sec.2 we have also shown that at least in the case of high x - ray luminosity clusters ( @xmath193 erg / s ) the above trends are unlikely driven by selection effects in the present observations .",
    "+ * _ constraining the magnetic field dependence on the mass _ + a correlation between the radio power and the cluster virial mass is naturally expected in the framework of electron acceleration models .",

    "3.1 ( eq.[setti ] ) , can reproduce the observed correlation for viable values of the physical parameters .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath117 , it is @xmath194 and the exponent agrees with the observed one ( @xmath195 ) by adopting a typical slope of the radio spectrum @xmath196 and a sub  linear scaling @xmath197 .",
    "+ a systematic comparison of the expected correlations between the radio power and the cluster mass with the observed one ( sect.3.1 & 2 ) allows the definition of a permitted region of the parameters space ( @xmath58,b ) , where a lower bound @xmath198 g is obtained in order not to overproduce via the ic scattering of the cmb photons the hard x - ray fluxes observed in the direction of a few grhs ( sect .",

    "+ the values of the average magnetic field intensity in the superlinear case are close ( slightly smaller ) to those obtained from the faraday rotation measurements ( e.g. , govoni & feretti 2004 ) , which , however , generally sample regions which are even more internally placed than those spanned by grhs .",
    "+ future observations will allow to better constrain the radio - x ray correlations and thus to better define the region of the model parameters .",

    "we find @xmath200 : the larger values are obtained for @xmath58 approaching the lower bound of the allowed region , because of the larger acceleration efficiency necessary to boost electrons at higher energies to obtain a fixed fraction of clusters with grhs .",
    "+ with an appropriate @xmath16 value for each set of ( @xmath58,b ) parameters we can calculate the probability of occurrence of grhs at larger redshifts for which observational data are not available . this probability depends on the merging history of clusters and on the relative importance of the synchrotron and ic losses , and shows a somewhat complicated behavior with cluster mass and redshift . the maximum value of this probability at a given redshift is found for a cluster mass @xmath125 ( eq.[m * ] ) which mark the transition between the compton and the synchrotron dominated phases . + in the case of sublinear scaling of the magnetic field with cluster mass ( b@xmath80.60.9 ) the allowed values of the strength of the magnetic field are relatively small ( fig .  [ regions ] ) , the value of @xmath125 is large and the ic losses are always dominant for the mass range of clusters with known grhs . as a consequence",
    "the probability to have grhs increases with cluster mass and decreases with redshift ( fig  [ pmz_0p9 ] ) . on the other hand superlinear scalings ( b@xmath81.21.7 ) imply allowed values of @xmath58 relatively large ( fig .",
    "[ regions ] ) , and even larger values of the magnetic field for the most massive objects . in this case",
    "the value @xmath125 falls within the range of masses spanned by grh clusters : the predicted fraction of clusters with grhs increases with mass , then reaches a maximum value at about @xmath201 , and finally falls down for larger masses ( fig  [ pmz_1p7 ] ) . at variance with the case of sublinear",
    "scaling , in this case the fraction of the most massive objects with grhs is expected to slightly increase with redshift , at least up to z=0.20.4 ( fig  [ pmz_1p7 ] ) where the bulk of turbulence is injected in a @xmath26cdm model ( cb05 ) . + * _ luminosity functions ( rhlfs ) _",

    "we find that , although the large uncertainties in the ( @xmath58,b ) region , the predicted local rhlfs are confined to a rather narrow bundle , the most characteristic common feature being the presence of a flattening / cut - off at radio powers below about @xmath202 w / hz at 1.4 ghz ( fig.[rhlf_noi_ens ] ) .",

    "this characteristic shape of the rhlfs , obtained in our paper for the first time , represents a unique prediction of particle acceleration models , and does not depend on the adopted physical details for the particle acceleration mechanism .",

    "<S> the most important evidence of non  thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters comes from giant radio halos ( grhs ) , spectacular synchrotron radio sources extended over @xmath0mpc scales , detected in the central regions of a growing number of massive galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> a promising possibility to explain these sources is given by _ in situ _ </S>",
    "<S> stochastic reacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated in the cluster volume during merger events . </S>",
    "<S> cassano & brunetti ( 2005 ) have recently shown that the expected fraction of clusters with radio halos and the increase of such a fraction with cluster mass can be reconciled with present observations provided that a fraction of 20 - 30 % of the turbulence in clusters is in the form of compressible modes .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we extend the above mentioned analysis , by including a scaling of the magnetic field strength with cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the framework of the reacceleration model , the observed correlations between the synchrotron radio power of a sample of 17 grhs and the x - ray properties of the hosting clusters are consistent with , and actually predicted by a magnetic field dependence on the virial mass of the form @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and typical @xmath3 g strengths of the average @xmath4 intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of grhs as a function of both cluster mass and redshift is obtained : the evolution of such a probability depends on the interplay between synchrotron and inverse compton losses in the emitting volume , and it is maximized in clusters for which the two losses are comparable .    </S>",
    "<S> the most relevant findings are that the predicted luminosity functions of grhs are peaked around a power @xmath5 w / hz , and severely cut - off at low radio powers due to the decrease of the electron reacceleration in smaller galaxy clusters , and that the occurrence of grhs at 1.4 ghz beyond a redshift @xmath6 appears to be negligible . as a related check </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the predicted integral radio source counts within a limited volume ( @xmath7 ) are consistent with present observational constraints . extending the source counts beyond z=0.2 we estimate that the total number of grhs to be discovered at @xmath8 mjy radio fluxes could be @xmath9 at 1.4 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the occurrence of grhs and their number counts at 150 mhz are estimated in view of the fortcoming operation of low frequency observatories ( lofar , lwa ) and compared with those at higher radio frequencies .    </S>",
