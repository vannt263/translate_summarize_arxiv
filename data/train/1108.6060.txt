    "in the nearby universe galaxies with stellar masses @xmath7  form a homogeneous population , with small scatter in their properties at fixed mass ( e.g. , djorgovski & davis 1987 ; blanton et  al .",
    "2003 ; kauffmann et  al .",
    "this homogeneity is somewhat puzzling in the context of standard models of galaxy formation , as in these models star formation and merging extend to recent epochs ( e.g. , de lucia et  al .",
    "models that aim to explain the tight scaling relations of massive galaxies usually invoke `` dry '' mergers in combination with feedback from agn to prevent gas cooling and star formation ( e.g. , croton et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "many studies have measured the properties of massive galaxies at earlier cosmic epochs to better constrain when and how they were formed .",
    "interestingly , it was found that massive galaxies have red rest - frame optical colors at least out to @xmath8 ( bell et  al . 2004 ; faber et  al .",
    "2007 ; brammer et  al . 2011 ) and probably beyond ( e.g. , van dokkum et  al . 2006 ; marchesini et  al .",

    "; brammer et  al .",
    "these galaxies mascarade as `` dead '' red sequence galaxies as they have very similar optical colors but in fact have very high inferred star formation rates .",
    "these apparently star - forming , massive galaxies are progenitors of at least a subset of massive galaxies today . in the nearby universe",
    "strongly star forming galaxies are typically gas - rich mergers , but several studies have argued that at higher redshift such galaxies more resemble `` scaled - up '' spiral galaxies than local mergers ( wolf et  al .",
    "2005 ; muzzin et  al . 2010 ; elbaz et  al .",
    "2011 ) . interpreting these galaxies , and their relation to the compact quiescent galaxies which exist at the same epoch , has been hampered by a lack of mass - complete samples with homogeneous data at the redshifts of interest .",
    "most existing samples are luminosity- rather than mass - selected , are based on photometric redshifts , lack rest - frame optical morphological information , and/or lack well - calibrated star formation diagnostics .    in this letter , we construct and study a spectroscopic stellar mass - limited sample of galaxies at @xmath1 , in order to quantify the properties of massive galaxies when the universe was @xmath10gyr old .",
    "we use data from the 3d - hst survey ( go-12177 , go-12328 ) , an hst / wfc3 treasury program that provides rest - frame optical spectroscopy and imaging at @xmath11 resolution for thousands of distant galaxies .",
    "the data presented here were obtained in the context of 3d - hst , a 248-orbit hst treasury program in cycles 18 and 19 .",

    "the f140w data were reduced using standard procedures for wfc3 imaging data , and resampled to a rectangular output grid with @xmath15 pixels .",
    "this fine sampling is justified as the four individual exposures in each visit are shifted with respect to each other by an integer + 0.5 pixels in @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "spectra were extracted from the grism data using the axe software ( kmmel et  al .",

    "many spectra are contaminated to some extent by overlapping spectra of neighbouring objects .",
    "the axe package provides a quantitative estimate of the contamination as a function of wavelength , which can be subtracted from the spectra .",
    "stellar masses were determined using the fast code ( kriek et  al .",

    "( approximately 50% of the full survey ) this selection gives a sample of 34 galaxies .",
    "we note that our sample is biased against close pairs , mostly due to the strict contamination criterion .",

    "the rest - frame equivalent widths for the detected galaxies range from 10  to 130 .",
    "the immediate implication is that a substantial fraction of massive galaxies at @xmath1 is likely forming stars .",
    "the h@xmath0 lines in nearby galaxies in this mass range are substantially weaker : the fraction of galaxies with @xmath3above the same mass limit at @xmath4 is only @xmath27% ( tremonti et  al .",
    "note that the h@xmath0 lines are typically broad in the 3d - hst spectra .",
    "this is not due to velocity broadening but rather to `` morphological broadening '' : in slitless spectroscopy spectral features are effectively images of the galaxy in that particular wavelength .",

    "the best - fitting age for the galaxies with low star formation is @xmath29gyr ; models with ages of up to 4gyr also provide good fits .",

    "= 8.5 cm    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ nmbs.plot ] the galaxies with strong h@xmath0 emission are slightly bluer ( by @xmath30mag in @xmath19 ) than the galaxies with weak h@xmath0 .",
    "the fact that the color difference is relatively small is because the star - forming galaxies have more dust : gaxies with @xmath31  have a mean best - fit @xmath32 whereas galaxies with @xmath3have @xmath33 ( see also , e.g. , labb et  al . 2005 ; papovich et  al .",
    "2006 ; brammer et  al .",
    "besides the number of objects with strong h@xmath0 emission , a striking aspect of fig .",
    "[ sample.plot ] is that the morphologies of the galaxies correlate with the h@xmath0 line strength .",
    "massive @xmath1 galaxies with the highest star formation rates tend to be `` grand design '' spiral galaxies , whereas those with no detected h@xmath0 emission tend to be early - type galaxies .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar to trends at @xmath34 , although massive galaxies with @xmath3  are rare in the nearby universe ( see  3 ) .",
    "we quantify this correlation between galaxy structure and star formation rate in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ ewn.plot ] , which shows the relation between  and sersic ( 1968 ) index .",
    "the sersic index is a quantitative measure of galaxy structure , and is a proxy for the bulge - to - disk ratio : galaxies dominated by disks have @xmath35 and galaxies dominated by bulges have @xmath36 .",
    "splitting the galaxies in two equal bins , the median sersic index of the 17 galaxies with @xmath37  is 2.2 , whereas it is 4.2 for the 17 galaxies with @xmath38 . according to the mann - whitney test",
    "this difference is significant at the @xmath39% confidence level .",
    "we infer that star formation in massive galaxies at @xmath1 typically takes place in disk - dominated ( spiral ) galaxies .",
    "this result is consistent with recent suggestions that many star - forming galaxies at @xmath6 are `` scaled - up '' versions of nearby galaxies ( e.g. , elbaz et  al .",
    "2011 ) .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ ewn.plot ] shows the relation between  and the inferred velocity dispersions of the galaxies , which are derived from their stellar masses , effective radii , and sersic indices following bezanson et  al .",
    "the inferred dispersions are a measure of the compactness of the stellar components of galaxies as they are proportional to @xmath40 ( with a sersic - dependent correction factor ) .",
    "again , there is a clear relation between these quantities : the median inferred dispersion of the half of the sample with the strongest h@xmath0 is @xmath41km / s whereas it is @xmath42km / s for the galaxies with the weakest h@xmath0 .",
    "the relation between  and dispersion has much smaller scatter than the relations of  with effective radius and mass separately .",
    "the trend in fig .",
    "[ ewn.plot ] is qualitatively consistent with the relation between estimated specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) and inferred dispersion found by franx et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "figure [ ewn.plot ] showcases the large variety of galaxies .",
    "the range in among massive galaxies with _ detected _ h@xmath0 is a factor of 12 , and it is obviously even larger when undetected galaxies are taken into account ( see fig .",
    "[ stack.plot ] ) .",
    "the structure and morphologies of galaxies also show a large range , going from large spiral galaxies with high  to compact early - type galaxies with low .",
    "the sersic indices span the full range between disk- to bulge - dominated values ( @xmath35 to @xmath36 ) and the inferred dispersions range from @xmath43to @xmath44 .",
    "we have shown that the 3d - hst treasury program is providing high quality near - ir spectroscopy and accompanying imaging for galaxies in the crucial epoch @xmath45 , when the cosmic star formation rate peaked ( e.g. , bouwens et  al .",
    "2007 ) . in this first paper we focused on a stellar mass - limited sample of 34 galaxies at @xmath20 , to study the properties of massive galaxies when the universe was 46gyr old .",
    "this is the first study of the h@xmath0 emission and rest - frame optical morphologies of a complete , mass - limited galaxy sample at @xmath6 .",
    "the most striking result of our study is the diversity of the spectra and structure of massive galaxies at @xmath6 : a large fraction has strong h@xmath0 emission , whereas others have absorption features characteristic of relatively old stellar populations .",
    "similarly , the morphologies , sersic indices , and implied velocity dispersions show a large range .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with previous studies that were based on photometric redshifts , the sed shapes of galaxies , and/or imaging of lower quality ( e.g. , franx et  al .",
    "2008 ; williams et  al . 2010 ; wuyts et  al . 2011b ; weinzirl et  al .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that at @xmath6 we are entering the epoch when massive galaxies were undergoing rapid evolution .",
    "specifically , the star - forming disks may be progenitors of some of today s most massive s0 and sa galaxies .",
    "noeske et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that the star formation rates of galaxies are tightly coupled to their mass and redshift , and it is interesting to compare the range in  in our sample to the scatter in their `` star formation main sequence '' . at fixed mass noeske",
    "et  al . ( 2007 ) find a 68% range in star formation rates of a factor of @xmath46 ( among galaxies with clear signs of star formation ) ; if we limit the sample to the central 68% of the distribution of galaxies with @xmath3we find a larger range of a factor of six .",
    "more to the point , within our sample the scatter in  can be significantly reduced by considering the structure of the galaxies . the 68% range in  among the 11 galaxies with inferred",
    "@xmath47  is only a factor of 1.7 .",
    "we therefore follow earlier work in suggesting that velocity dispersion ( or surface density ) is a more fundamental parameter than mass in determining the properties of galaxies ( see , e.g. , kauffmann et  al . 2003b ; franx et  al .",

    "2000 ; wuyts et  al .",
    "2011a ) , we find a median stellar mass increase due to star formation of @xmath48% per gyr for the galaxies with @xmath3 .",
    "an important question is _ where _ in the galaxies the star formation is occurring , that is , which structural component of massive galaxies is in the process of formation at @xmath1 . due to",
    "the nature of grism spectroscopy the 3d - hst data provide 2d emission line maps at the spatial resolution of hst .",

    "[ spiral.plot ] the spatial extent of the h@xmath0 emission rules out dominant contributions from active nuclei to the integrated line fluxes .",
    "a key open question is what drives the diversity of massive galaxies at @xmath6 . at fixed stellar mass , we see large , star forming spiral galaxies and very compact galaxies in which star formation has apparently ceased .",
    "if agn feedback is responsible for shutting off star formation in massive galaxies it is clearly more effective in some galaxies than in others",
    ". it may be that agn feedback correlates with black hole mass , which correlates better with velocity dispersion than with stellar mass ( e.g. , magorrian et  al .",
    "it will also be interesting to study correlations with other parameters , such as the environment , at fixed stellar mass and at fixed ( inferred ) velocity dispersion .",
    "finally , it will be important to extend this study to lower masses and to higher redshifts .",
    "star forming galaxies that have been studied at @xmath49 tend to have higher  and also more irregular morphologies than the galaxies studied here ( e.g. , erb et  al .",
