    "the standard theory of the strong interactions is based on quarks interacting through non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "this system is remarkable in its paucity of parameters .",
    "once the overall scale is set , perhaps by working in units where the proton mass is unity , the only remaining parameters are the quark masses . in general these are complex numbers , although field redefinitions allow removing all phases but one , usually called the strong cp parameter theta . for a recent review ,",
    "see ref .",
    "thus the number of physical parameters for qcd is one more than the number of quark species .",
    "as is well known , if theta is non - trivial , the theory violates cp symmetry .",
    "as cp appears to be a good symmetry of hadronic physics , the strong cp puzzle asks the question why should this parameter be so small experimentally .    in this paper",
    "i restrict myself to two - flavor qcd and explore the qualitative behavior as the most general mass terms are varied . using effective potential techniques ,",
    "i find a rich phase diagram with regions of both first and second order phase transitions .",
    "i find that there can be interesting long distance physics even when no individual quark mass vanishes .",
    "i also delve more deeply into the old argument @xcite for a fundamental ambiguity in defining a vanishing quark mass .",
    "these effects are inherently non - perturbative and lead to unsettled issues for matching lattice with perturbative results .    of course",
    ", with qcd being an interacting quantum field theory , nothing has been proven rigorously . to proceed",
    "i assume that qcd exists as a field theory and confines in the usual way .",
    "in addition i will work in the conventional picture of spontaneous breaking of approximate chiral symmetry as the explanation for the lightness of the pions .",
    "i also assume the generation of the singlet pseudoscalar meson mass is tied to the anomaly .",
    "for simplicity i work with the two - flavor theory with only the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks , assuming their masses are light enough that conventional chiral expansions make sense .",
    "the generalization to more flavors is straightforward , although there are some rather fascinating further consequences @xcite .",
    "i begin in section [ spinflip ] with a simple argument on how the various quark masses indirectly influence each other .",
    "the obscurity of these effects in a mass independent regularization scheme has raised some controversy , which i address in section [ critique ] .",
    "section [ general ] turns to the most general mass term for the two - flavor theory . here",
    "i discuss some of the conventions needed for formulating this question .",
    "section [ strongcp ] relates the mass parameters to the strong cp problem and discusses the issues with pursuing a vanishing lightest quark mass .",
    "section [ diagram ] uses an effective potential argument to develop the qualitative phase diagram as a function of the independent mass parameters .",
    "finally , the basic ideas are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "i begin with a reminder of some basic properties expected for massless two - flavor qcd . while the classical theory is conformally invariant , it is commonly believed that in the quantized theory confinement and dimensional transmutation generate a non - trivial mass scale @xmath2 .",
    "this scale is scheme dependent , but that will not enter the qualitative discussion here . in particular , the theory should contain massive stable nucleons . on the other hand ,",
    "spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking is expected to give rise to three massless pions as goldstone bosons .",
    "in addition , the two - flavor analog of the eta prime meson should acquire a mass from the anomaly .    in this picture ,",
    "the eta prime and neutral pion involve distinct combinations of quark - antiquark bound states . in the simple quark model",
    "the neutral pseudoscalars involve the combinations @xmath3 here i include a gluonic contribution from mixing between the @xmath4 and glueball states .",
    "when the quarks are degenerate , isospin forbids such mixing for the pion .    projecting out helicity states for the quarks , @xmath5 , the pseudoscalars are combinations of left with right states , _ i.e. _ @xmath6",
    "thus , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ scattering ] , meson exchange will contribute to a hypothetical quark - quark spin - flip scattering experiment .",
    "more precisely , the four point function @xmath7 should not vanish .",
    "( scalar meson exchange will also contribute to this process , but this is not important for the qualitative argument below . ) of course i assume that some sort of gauge fixing has been done to eliminate a trivial vanishing of this function from an integral over gauges .",
    "it is important that the @xmath8 and @xmath4 are not degenerate .",
    "this is due to the anomaly and the fact that the @xmath4 is not a goldstone boson . at a more abstract level",
    "this @xmath8@xmath4 splitting is ascribed to topological structures in the gauge field , but such details are not necessary for the discussion here .",
    "because the mesons are not degenerate , their contributions to the above diagram can not cancel .",
    "the conclusion of this simple argument is that helicity - flip quark - quark scattering is not suppressed as the mass goes to zero .",
    "now consider turning on a small @xmath1 quark mass while leaving the up quark massless .",
    "formally this mass allows one to connect the in - going and out - going down - quark lines in fig .  [ scattering ] and",
    "thereby induce a mixing between the left and right handed up quark .",
    "such a process is sketched in fig .  [",
    "induced ] .",
    "here i allow for additional gluon exchanges to compensate for turning the pseudoscalar field into a traditional mass term .",
    "so the presence of a non - zero @xmath1 quark mass will induce an effective mass for the @xmath0 quark , even if the latter initially vanishes . as a consequence , non - perturbative effects will renormalize @xmath9 .",
    "if this ratio is zero at some scale , it can not remain so for all scales . only in the isospin limit are quark mass ratios renormalization group invariant . as lattice simulations include all perturbative and non - perturbative effects , this phenomenon is automatically included in such an approach .",
    "confinement plays a crucial role in what is effectively an ambiguity in defining quark masses .",
    "because quarks can not travel long distances in isolation , their masses can not be directly inferred from long distance propagators .",
    "this is tied directly with the phase diagram discussed in section [ phasediagram ] , where it is shown that no discernable physical structure is seen when single quark mass vanishes .",
    "this cross talk between the masses of different quark species is a relatively straightforward consequence of the chiral anomaly and has been discussed several times in the past , usually in the context of gauge field topology and the index theorem @xcite . despite the simplicity of the above argument , the conclusion is frequently met with skepticism from the perturbative community . in perturbation theory ,",
    "spin flip processes are suppressed as the quark masses go to zero .",
    "the above discussion shows that this lore need not apply when anomalous processes come into play .",
    "in particular , mass renormalization can not be flavor blind and the concept of mass independent regularization is problematic . since the quark masses influence each other , there are inherent ambiguities defining @xmath10 .",
    "this has consequences for the strong cp problem , discussed further below . furthermore , since these effects involve quark mass differences , a traditional perturbative regulator such as @xmath11 is not complete when @xmath12 . because of this , the practice of matching lattice calculations to @xmath11 is problematic , a point that is sometimes ignored @xcite .",
    "@xcite also suffers from an uncontrolled extrapolation in the number of quark species @xcite . )",
    "given the simplicity of the argument in the previous section , it may seem surprising that it often receives severe criticism .",
    "the first complaint sometimes made is that one should work directly with bare quark masses .",
    "this ignores the fact that the bare quark masses all vanish under renormalization .",
    "the renormalization group equation for a quark mass reads @xmath13 where the leading coefficient is well known , @xmath14 as asymptotic freedom drives the bare coupling to zero , the bare masses behave as @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( explicitly given later ) is the first term in the beta function controlling the vanishing of the bare coupling in the continuum limit .",
    "since all bare quark masses are formally zero , one must address these questions in terms of a renormalization scheme at a finite cutoff .",
    "the second objection often made is that in a mass independent regularization scheme , mass ratios are automatically constant .",
    "such an approach asks that the renormalization group function @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ mrg ] ) be chosen to be independent of the quark species and mass .",
    "this immediately implies the constancy of all quark mass ratios . as only the first term in",
    "the perturbative expansion of @xmath17 is universal , a mass independent scheme is indeed an allowed procedure .",
    "however , such a scheme obscures the off - diagonal @xmath18 effect on @xmath19 discussed above .",
    "in particular , by forcing constancy of bare mass ratios , one will find that the ratios of physical particle masses will vary as a function of cutoff .",
    "this will be in a manner that cancels the flow from the process in section [ spinflip ] .",
    "the fact that physical particle mass ratios are not just a function of quark mass ratios is shown explicitly in section [ phasediagram ] , where it is shown that in the chiral limit the combination @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 .    from a non - perturbative point of view",
    ", having physical mass ratios vary with cutoff seems rather peculiar ; indeed , the particle masses are physical quantities that would be natural to hold fixed . and , even though a mass independent approach is theoretically possible , there is no guarantee that any given ratio @xmath22 will be universal between schemes . finally , the lattice approach itself is usually implemented with physical particle masses as input . as such it is not a mass independent regulator , making a perturbative matching to lattice results rather subtle .",
    "a third frequent complaint against the argument in section [ spinflip ] is that one should simply do the matching at some high energy , say 100 gev , where `` instanton '' effects are exponentially suppressed and irrelevant .",
    "this point of view has several problems .",
    "first , the lattice simulations are not done at miniscule scales and non - perturbative effects are present and substantial .",
    "furthermore , the exponential suppression of topological effects is in the inverse coupling , which runs logarithmically with the scale . as such ,",
    "the non - perturbative suppression is a power law in the scale and straightforward to estimate .",
    "recall the renormalization group prediction for how the eta prime mass depends on the coupling in the continuum limit @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the number of quark flavors , and @xmath27 is the cutoff scale , _",
    "i.e. _ the lattice spacing with such a renormalization scheme .",
    "while this formula indeed shows the exponential suppression in @xmath28 , this is cancelled by the inverse cutoff factor in just such a way that the mass of this physical particle remains finite .",
    "the ambiguity in the quark mass splitting is controlled by the mass splitting @xmath29 as well as being proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "considering @xmath31 mev at a scale of @xmath32 gev , a rough estimate of the order of the @xmath0 quark mass shift is @xmath33 a number comparable to typical phenomenological estimates .",
    "of course the result depends on scale , but that dependence is only logarithmic and given by eq .",
    "( [ mflow ] ) .",
    "additional flavors will reduce the size of this effect ; with the strange quark present , it should be proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to note that for a modest number of flavors the exponent controlling the coupling constant suppression in eq .",
    "[ rg ] differs substantially from the classical instanton action @xmath35 this difference arises because one should consider topological excitations above the quantum , not the classical , vacuum .",
    "zero modes of the dirac operator are still responsible for the bulk of the eta prime mass , but naive semi - classical arguments strongly underestimate their effect .",
    "given the confusion over the meaning of quark masses , it is useful to explore the behavior of two - flavor qcd as these quantities are varied",
    ". here i review how the theory depends on the three non - trivial mass parameters .",
    "these includes the possibility of explicit cp violation .",
    "the full theory has a rather rich phase diagram , including both first and second order phase transitions , some occurring when none of the quark masses vanish .    for the following the quark fields @xmath36 carry implicit isospin , color , and flavor indices .",
    "i assume that the theory in the massless limit has the flavored chiral symmetry under @xmath37 here @xmath38 represents the pauli matrices generating isospin rotations . the angles @xmath39 are arbitrary rotation parameters .",
    "this , of course , is the chiral symmetry that is spontaneously broken to give the massless goldstone pions .",
    "i wish to construct the most general possible two - flavor mass term to add to the massless lagrangian . such should be a dimension 3 quadratic form in the fermion fields and",
    "should transform as a singlet under lorentz transformations . for simplicity ,",
    "i only consider quantities that are charge neutral as well .",
    "this leaves four candidate fields , giving the generalized form for consideration @xmath40 the first two terms are naturally interpreted as giving the average quark mass and the quark mass difference , respectively .",
    "the remaining two terms are less conventional .",
    "the @xmath41 term is connected with the cp violating parameter of the theory .",
    "the final @xmath42 term has been used in conjunction with the wilson discretization of lattice fermions , where it is referred to as a `` twisted mass '' @xcite .",
    "its utility in that context is the ability to reduce lattice discretization errors , but that is not the subject of this note .",
    "these four terms are not independent .",
    "indeed , consider the above flavored chiral rotation in the @xmath43 direction , @xmath44 . under this",
    "the terms transform as @xmath45 such a rotation mixes @xmath46 with @xmath42 and @xmath47 with @xmath41 . using this freedom",
    ", one can select any one of the @xmath48 to vanish and a second to be positive .",
    "the most common choice is to set @xmath49 and use @xmath46 as controlling the average quark mass .",
    "then @xmath47 gives the quark mass difference , and cp violation appears in @xmath41 .",
    "this , however , is only a convention .",
    "the alternative `` twisted mass '' scheme @xcite , makes the choice @xmath50 .",
    "this uses @xmath51 for the average quark mass , and @xmath41 becomes the up - down mass difference . in this case",
    "@xmath47 becomes the cp violating term .",
    "it is amusing to note that an up down quark mass difference in this formulation involves the naively cp odd @xmath52 .",
    "the strong cp problem has been rotated into the smallness of the @xmath53 term , which with the usual conventions is the mass difference .",
    "but because of the flavored chiral symmetry , both sets of conventions are physically equivalent .    for the following",
    "i make the arbitrary choice @xmath49 , although one should remember that this is only a convention and i could have chosen any of the four parameters in eq .",
    "( [ genmass ] ) to vanish . with this choice two - flavor qcd , after scale setting , depends on three mass parameters @xmath54 it is the possible presence of @xmath41 that represents the strong cp problem .",
    "as all the parameters are independent and transform differently under the symmetries of the problem , there is no connection between the strong cp problem and @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "as is well known , the chiral anomaly is responsible for the singlet rotation @xmath55 not being a valid symmetry , despite the fact that @xmath56 naively anti - commutes with the massless dirac operator .",
    "the anomaly is quite nicely summarized via fujikawa s @xcite approach where after the above rotation the fermion measure in the path integral picks up a factor of @xmath57 using the dirac operator @xmath58 itself as a regulator , define @xmath59 in any give gauge configuration only the zero eigenmodes of @xmath58 contribute , and by the index theorem this is connected to the winding number of the gauge configuration .",
    "the conclusion is that the above rotation changes the fermion measure by an amount depending non - trivially on the gauge field configuration .",
    "note that this anomalous rotation allows one to remove any topological term from the gauge part of the action .",
    "naively this would have been yet another parameter for the theory , but by including all three mass terms for the fermions , this can be absorbed .",
    "for the following i consider that any topological term has thus been rotated away .",
    "after this one is left with the three mass parameters above , all of which are independent and relevant to physics .",
    "these parameters are a complete set for two - flavor qcd ; however , this choice differs somewhat from what is often discussed .",
    "formally one defines the more conventional variables as @xmath60 particularly for @xmath61 , this is a rather complicated change of variables . for non - degenerate quarks in the context of the phase diagram discussed below , the variables @xmath62 are more natural .",
    "the strong interactions preserve cp to high accuracy .",
    "thus only two of the three possible mass parameters seem to be needed . with the above conventions , it is natural to ask why is @xmath41 so small ?",
    "it is the concept of unification that brings this question to the fore .",
    "the weak interactions of course do violate cp .",
    "thus , if the electroweak and the strong interactions separate at some high scale , why does nt some remnant of this breaking survive in the strong sector ? how is cp recovered for the nuclear force ?",
    "several `` solutions '' to this puzzle have been proposed .",
    "perhaps the simplest is that there is no unification and the strong interactions should be considered on their own with the electroweak effects being only a small perturbation . a second approach is to add an additional `` axion '' field to make the cp phase a dynamical field that relaxes to zero @xcite .",
    "the coupling of this additional field is not determined a priori , and thus it need only be small enough to have avoided detection in past experiments .",
    "another often proposed solution involves having the lightest quark mass vanish , making its phase irrelevant .",
    "several years ago this was criticized because the definition of an isolated quark mass is inherently ambiguous due to confinement @xcite .",
    "as this conclusion remains controversial , i return to this topic and reexpress the problem in terms of the above mass terms .",
    "i hope this language will clarify why relating a vanishing up quark mass to the strong cp problem is a tautology .    why is a vanishing up quark mass not a sensible approach ? from the above",
    ", one can define the up quark mass as a complex number @xmath63 but the quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath41 are independent parameters with different symmetry properties . with our conventions",
    ", @xmath46 represents an isosinglet mass contribution , @xmath47 is isovector in nature , and @xmath41 is cp violating . and , as extensively discussed earlier , the combination @xmath64 is scale and scheme dependent .",
    "the strong cp problem only requires small @xmath41 .",
    "so while it may be true formally that @xmath65 this would depend on scale and one might well regard this as `` not even wrong . ''",
    "as a function of the three mass parameters , qcd has a rather intricate phase diagram . from simple chiral lagrangian arguments this diagram can be qualitatively mapped out . ref .",
    "@xcite studied this system in the @xmath66 case ; a first order transition is expected along the @xmath41 axes at @xmath50 . in conventional notation",
    ", this corresponds to the strong cp parameter @xmath61 taking the value @xmath67 . that paper , however , incorrectly speculated on the structure for non - degenerate quarks . in ref .",
    "@xcite the picture was generalized to several degenerate flavors and the first order transition at @xmath68 was shown to be generic for all @xmath69 .",
    "@xcite studied the phase diagram for @xmath70 and showed how the isospin breaking @xmath47 term splits the chiral transition into two second - order transitions separated by a phase with spontaneous cp violation .",
    "these second order transitions occur where none of the quarks are massless .",
    "the full phase diagram in terms of all mass parameters can be deduced from a linear sigma model @xcite analysis , generalizing ref .",
    "@xcite . for this , define the composite fields @xmath71 in terms of these , a natural starting effective potential is @xmath72 here @xmath73 and @xmath74 are `` low energy constants '' that bring in a chirally symmetric coupling of @xmath75 with @xmath76 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath73 gives mass to the @xmath4 and @xmath77 mesons while @xmath74 splits their masses .",
    "the sign of the @xmath74 term is suggested so that @xmath78 .",
    "the effect of the anomaly is manifest in these terms .    the potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) is a somewhat arbitrary model .",
    "it is natural to ask if the results of this section are robust under variations of this form .",
    "the crucial feature of the potential is the non - trivial minima associated with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "something similar to the @xmath73 term is needed to give the @xmath4 a non - vanishing mass .",
    "the @xmath74 term is somewhat arbitrary ; ref .",
    "@xcite discusses how things would change qualitatively if it sign was reversed .",
    "the other implicit assumption is that the masses are small enough that they do nt dramatically alter the underlying structure of the potential . with these caveats",
    ", the final phase diagram should be qualitatively correct for any similar potential .",
    "this potential builds on the famous `` mexican hat '' or `` wine bottle '' potential , in which the goldstone pions are associated with the flat directions running around at constant @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath41 terms do not directly affect the @xmath80 and @xmath67 fields , but induce an expectation value for @xmath81 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this in turn results in the @xmath73 and @xmath74 terms inducing a warping of the mexican hat into two separate minima , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ warping ] .",

    "[ edge ] . for large @xmath83",
    "only @xmath80 will have an expectation , with sign determined by the sign of @xmath46 .",
    "the pion will be massive , but the quark mass difference will give a neutral pion mass below that of the charged pions . as @xmath46 decreases in magnitude at fixed @xmath47 ,",
    "eventually the neutral pion becomes massless and condenses .",
    "this is sketched in fig .  [ ising ] .",
    "an order parameter for the transition is the expectation value of the @xmath8 field , with the transition being in the class of the four dimensional ising model .    in this simple model",
    "the ratio of the neutral to charged pion masses can be estimated from a quadratic expansion about the minimum of the potential . for @xmath70 and @xmath46 above the transition line , this gives @xmath84 the second order transition is located where this vanishes , and thus occurs for @xmath46 proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "note that this equation shows that a constant quark mass ratio does not correspond to a constant meson mass ratio and vice versa .",
    "this is the ambiguity discussed in section [ spinflip ] .",

    "non - perturbative effects in qcd couple the renormalization group flow for the masses of different fermion species .",
    "this effect is absent in perturbation theory , but is automatically included in lattice gauge simulations .",
    "this coupling means that quark mass ratios are generally not constants but depend on renormalization scale .",
