    "there is a growing consensus that a large fraction of core - collapse supernovae , possibly including the whole subset of type ib / c events , undergo significantly asymmetrical explosions . while clearly rotation and magnetic fields may play some role in this , instability associated with the stalled shock that forms at a radius of 100 - 300 km and lasts for a few hundred microseconds post bounce offers the intriguing possibility of generating asymmetrical explosions from a symmetrical progenitor , since such instability is usually dominated by low mode @xmath0 , 2 oscillations of the shock front .",
    "the original speculation for the origin of such oscillations @xcite in terms of convection behind the shock , following @xcite has been revised in recent years .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that post shock advection can stabilize convective instability ( @xcite only deals with a static case ) , and that convection alone can not produce the dominant @xmath0,2 modes . in adiabatic simulations of gas with polytropic index 4/3 , which as shown by @xcite is a good description of shocked inner regions of a core - collapse supernova ,",
    "@xcite were the first to associate the instability with the shock itself .",
    "@xcite attributed this to the growth of trapped sound waves , travelling essentially laterally around the central accretor .",
    "this must be a purely shock driven instability , since convection is absent , and hence qualitatively different to the original speculations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite attribute this shock - driven instability to an `` advective - acoustic '' cycle , originally introduced by @xcite in the context of black hole accretion flows .",
    "vorticity perturbations generated at the distorted shock front advect inwards , and couple with outgoing sound waves at the inner boundary of the postshock accretion flow . upon reaching the outer shock , these sound waves further distort the shock front , leading to a positive feedback .",
    "while the mechanisms of @xcite and @xcite appear to produce similar outcomes in non - rotating cases , indeed @xcite actually confirm the numerical values of frequencies and growth rates measured by @xcite , it is possible the presence of rotation might lead to substantial differences , which we discuss further below .",
    "instabilities of the accretion shock also are observed in simulations with a more accurate treatment of supernova microphysics , with a realistic equation of state , neutrino transport and attendant nuclear reactions , and more physically motivated boundary conditions . @xcite and @xcite investigate the role of such instabilities in generating pulsar natal kicks , while @xcite study the ejection of metal clumps to the outer regions of supernova ejecta . @xcite",
    "also see the standing accretion shock instability 100 - 300 ms postbounce .",
    "the important feature of their simulation , though , is a core gravity wave at late times that transfers acoustic power to the shock to continue powering the explosion , the initial perturbation for which is possibly seeded by the accretion shock instability . @xcite",
    "also favor the interpretation of @xcite of an advective - acoustic cycle , though in this and the other more realistic simulations cited above , the exact mechanism of instability is difficult to identify .",
    "to avoid this problem , @xcite performed numerical simulations based on unperturbed spherically symmetrical shock accretion flows given by @xcite , a sort of `` middle ground '' between the adiabatic flows of @xcite and @xcite and the full supernova simulations of other workers .",
    "@xcite clearly identify and measure growth rates for @xmath0 and 2 mode instabilities .",
    "the real parts of the frequencies scale with @xmath2 , the integral between the inner radius of the accretion flow and the shock of the sum of the inverses of the sound speed and advection speed , suggesting that an advective - acoustic mechanism , as advanced by @xcite and @xcite , is at work .",
    "however @xcite only perturb the radial velocity component of the initially spherical symmetrical unperturbed flow , which may unduly influence their results , compared to allowing perturbations in polar and azimuthal directions as well .",
    "@xcite include rather more physics , and again based on the frequencies at which modes grow , conclude that an advective - acoustic cycle is at work .    in this work we present another approach to the problem .",
    "following the work of @xcite on planar shocks in the interstellar medium , we derive an approximate dispersion relation for oscillations of the accretion shock by adding the effect of a gravitational field and spherical geometry . in the case that the postshock advection is neglected , a quartic equation ( actually a quadratic in @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the frequency of oscillation ) results , becoming a quintic equation in @xmath5 with the inclusion of advection .",
    "we find that in both cases for @xmath6 , for all except the highest values of the ratio of the shock radius to the radius of the inner boundary , modes with @xmath0 grow the fastest ( in fact for cases where the postshock radial velocity , @xmath7 , no other nonradial modes grow ) .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath0 in @xmath8 gas in this regime , postshock advection is not crucial to the operation of the instability .",
    "thus in general these results will support the conclusions of @xcite that the instability proceeds by the growth of trapped waves in this regime .",
    "nevertheless , regions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 parameter space exist where we find modes that are only unstable in the presence of postshock advection , which we interpret as an advective - acoustic cycle , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the frequencies of the growing modes are similar , suggesting that frequency alone is not a good discriminator of the mechanism of instability .",
    "as will be seen below , this might be expected in a comparison of a perturbation advected radially between the shock and inner boundary , and a sound wave traveling essentially laterally around the shock .",
    "we consider an unperturbed model in which spherically accreting plasma is decelerated at a spherically symmetrical shock , before accreting onto a protoneutron star .",
    "the accretion shock is at radius @xmath11 , and we take an inner boundary at @xmath12 , maintained at constant pressure , where plasma cools and decouples from the postshock flow .",
    "the postshock flow is modeled by the bernoulli equation , as given in appendix a. gas with polytropic index @xmath13 decelerates , and gas with @xmath14 accelerates away from the shock towards the inner boundary .",
    "we shall be solely concerned with @xmath13 .",
    "the dominant variations with radius are in pressure and density , as shown in figure 1 .    to treat the perturbation , we follow in large part the methods and notation of @xcite who derive an approximate dispersion relation for application to shocks with arbitrary postshock structure .",

    "the limit @xmath101 gives a dispersion relation similar to the exact solution in the thin shock limit @xcite , and identical to this limit if terms describing the evolution of the shock are neglected from the exact solution .",

    "our case is particularly suitable since the standing accretion shock can be treated as an equilibrium state @xcite , i.e. it does not evolve in our approximation .    just taking @xmath7 , equation 20 yields a quadratic equation in @xmath3 for which simple solutions exist .",
    "@xcite find growing shock oscillations in the case of decelerating shocks , with a post shock rarefaction . in our case ,",

    "the @xmath52 mode is marginally stable in the absence of advection .",
    "with advection included , it is stable for the lowest @xmath125 , but otherwise unstable .",
    "taken together , there is reasonable qualitative agreement with @xcite , but quantitatively , the model is less stable than it should be .",
    "growth rates are too high , and the @xmath52 mode becomes unstable too quickly as @xmath125 increases .",
    "better qualitative and quantitative agreement is found in the model with @xmath118 and @xmath119 given in table 2 . , and",
    "also illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the stability of @xmath52 is improved , and advection becomes relatively more necessary to the instability of @xmath0 .",
    "these results have a simple interpretation in terms of the mechanisms put forward by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "where advection is not necessary to the instability , i.e. for the @xmath0 mode at low values of @xmath125 , the wave growth must be due to trapped sound waves similarly to the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of advection in these cases generally increases the growth rate , either due to a separate contribution of an `` advective - acoustic '' nature or because of the effect of postshock advection on the propagation of sound waves . in cases where no instability occurs",
    "unless advection terms are present , the growth must be due to an advective - acoustic cycle similar to @xcite . in our model ,",
    "these cases include all the @xmath1 modes , as well as the @xmath0 modes for large values of @xmath125 .",
    "these results and interpretation add a new twist to the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "these authors demonstrate that for @xmath126 the advective - acoustic cycle is the cause of the @xmath0 instability .",
    "their analysis makes use of a wkb approximation that is not valid for lower @xmath125",
    ". however they proceed to argue that since growth rates and frequencies vary smoothly as one goes to lower values of @xmath125 , the mechanism of instability should remain the same .",
    "however our results suggests that even though the eigenvalues vary smoothly , the mechanism of instability changes to more closely resemble that suggested by @xcite .",
    "a number of simplifying assumptions have been introduced into the analysis to make the algebra tractable . we have assumed an isothermal perturbation , used a greatly simplified interior boundary condition , and have dropped all terms in the advection velocity of order higher than @xmath127 .",
    "nevertheless our model appears to capture the basic features of the numerical simulations of @xcite , _ and _ the analytic theory of @xcite and @xcite , in the appropriate regions of parameter space .",
    "looking at the values of @xmath128 given by equation 15 , we find when @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "consequently , @xmath134 gives a density perturbation @xmath135 that is greatest at the outer shock and considerably smaller at the inner boundary , while @xmath136 gives a density perturbation that varies much less with radius , but can be largest at the outer shock or at the inner boundary .",
    "when @xmath52 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in this case the radial mode can have a large maximum of @xmath139 at the inner boundary . given the ad hoc nature of our inner boundary condition ( see appendix b ) , we might expect less accurate results for the radial mode than for nonradial modes , which does indeed seem to be the case .",
    "the vorticity ( calculated from equations 13 ) increases inwards approximately as @xmath140 .",
    "the third solution with @xmath141 everywhere must represent a purely vortical perturbation .",
    "so far we have developed a dispersion relation from the equations of hydrodynamics , and found instabilities through the existence of complex roots .",
    "we have not made any comment on the precise mechanism of the instability , other than to comment that sound / gravity waves appear to grow .",
    "the vortical - acoustic cycle has been explained by @xcite .",
    "a distortion of the accretion shock produces a vorticity perturbation that is advected inwards . upon reaching the inner boundary ,",
    "the vorticity perturbation produces an upward moving sound wave , which reinforces the shock distortion when it arrives there , producing a net increase in the original perturbation . over many cycles , exponential growth ensues .",
    "sound waves produced at the outer shock , in a realistic model , will not propagate towards the center due to the effects of refraction .",
    "instead , they will propagate around the circumference of the shock .",
    "@xcite speculate that sound waves produced at one position on the shock surface by a density inhomogeneity will propagate around until they meet on the opposite side , where their excess pressure produces a shock distortion that sends another pair of sound waves back again .",
    "it is not immediately clear without detailed calculation that such a process should produce a growing ( as opposed to damping ) oscillation .",
    "we speculate that growth must also be aided by the flow of plasma in through the accretion shock . in figure 3",
    "we show flowlines for shocked plasma in an accretion shock with a 10% @xmath0 modulation of the shock radius . when the shock is shifted up by the instability , incoming plasma in the equatorial regions is diverted downwards by the now oblique shock .",
    "this non - radial flow of shocked plasma enhances the oscillation and leads to further wave growth .",
    "this aspect is similar to the thin shell overstability of decelerating shocks @xcite , ( although @xcite put forward a different view ) , though in these cases the pressure produced by gravitational confinement plays no role , and overstability exists for a postshock density gradient oppositely directed to our case .",
    "thus both the advective - acoustic ( or vortical - acoustic ) instability and the growth due to trapped sound waves have their origins in perturbations of either vorticity or pressure in the post shock flow produced by the distorted shock front .",
    "there is considerable interest in the effects of rotation on core - collapse explosions . in particular ,",
    "in which direction with respect to the rotation axis should one expect the strongest growth ?",
    "this would have obvious implications for the directions of pulsar kicks , assuming the such instabilities are the correct mechanism . in the case of an advective - acoustic instability",
    ", we should expect the decrease in the postshock advection in the plane of rotation to give stronger instability and hence strongest growth along the axis of rotation .    in the case of instability driven by trapped sound waves we can sketch out the effect of including a nonzero @xmath26 in the forgoing analysis .",
    "we derive the extra terms to be included in the dispersion relation in the limits @xmath74 and @xmath142 .",
    "we also neglect any distortion of the shock front by the rotation .",
    "such considerations require more detailed physics , neutrino cooling near the inner boundary at a minimum @xcite , and ideally also neutrino luminosities and mass accretion rates ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "this keeps @xmath143 , which should be true in any case if @xmath7 , but even in the absence of advection , a distortion of the shock front may change the boundary condition leading to equation b2 .",
    "the perturbed velocities are @xmath144 with @xmath145 the linearized continuity equation becomes @xmath146 after dividing through by @xmath139 , with solutions for @xmath128",
    "@xmath147 we again have @xmath148 if @xmath141 , so equation ( 14 ) still holds .",
    "then , with unchanged boundary conditions , the dispersion relation is the same as before ( with @xmath7 and @xmath149 in equation b6 ) , but with the extra terms ( neglecting the change @xmath150 , which in any case is trivial for @xmath8 ) @xmath151 the new quintic equation is again solved numerically , with results given in table 3 for the @xmath152 component of the @xmath0 mode .",
    "we generally find higher growth rates increasing with rotation rate for the @xmath152 ( @xmath153 remains unchanged ) , which would indicate higher growth in the plane of rotation .",
    "this happens even in cases where in the absence of rotation , the advective - acoustic instability seems to be dominant .",
    "we speculate that rotation increases the growth rate of trapped sound waves for nonzero @xmath40 , so much so that they can grow even in cases with zero growth in the absence of rotation .    at higher rotation rates ,",
    "the distortion of the shock front can not be neglected .",
    "we expect the equilibrium shock position to be oblate , i.e. bulging out at the equator as demonstrated quantitatively by @xcite .",
    "we emphasize again that our results are not applicable in this regime .",
    "using heuristic arguments based on @xcite , and a few other approximations , we have derived an approximate dispersion relations for oscillations of a standing spherical accretion shock .",
    "the pursuit of an analytic treatment further through the problem than has previously been attempted arguably allows greater physical insight , albeit at the expense of reduced quantitative accuracy .",
    "while our model might not be considered much more than a `` toy model '' , it does capture most of the features of previous works of the instability of such shocks .",
    "it offers a potential resolution to the mild disagreement between the works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find results consistent with both works , but in different regions of parameter space . for low values of @xmath125 ,",
    "the growth of trapped waves dominates in the @xmath0 , and appears to be the most important mechanism .",
    "the inclusion of post shock advection gives a small change , usually an increase , in the growth rate . at",
    "higher @xmath9 , or @xmath125 , postshock advection appears to become crucial to the instability , which leads us to interpret it as an advective - acoustic cycle . in a treatment of @xmath8 gas in core collapse supernovae",
    ", @xcite only find advective - acoustic instability for @xmath154 , with the growth rate increasing out to @xmath155 .",
    "@xcite are only able to demonstrate the operation of the advective - acoustic cycle for @xmath156 , due to the nature of the approximations involved , but conjecture that it should also operate at lower @xmath125 .",
    "our models agree with their demonstrations at large shock radii , but suggest that at smaller shock radius , the instability should change to resemble that observed by @xcite .",
    "the precise mechanism of instability probably becomes more significant in the rotating case .",
    "the advective - acoustic instability must grow preferentially along the rotation axis , where the postshock advection is not affected by the rotation .",
    "by contrast , we conjecture in section 3.3 that rotation should enhance the growth of trapped sound / gravity waves principally in the plane of rotation , leading to stronger growth in directions perpendicular to the rotation axis",
    ". such effects may have important consequences for pulsar natal kicks , if these derive from hydrodynamic kick mechanisms .",
    "this work has been supported by the chandra gi program , the nasa ltsa and apra programs , and by basic research funds of the office of naval research .",
    "i acknowledge a scientific discussion with ethan vishniac , and an extremely careful and constructive reading of the paper by an anonymous referee .",
    "here we summarize the model for the postshock flow in spherical accretion used by @xcite .",
    "the flow is given by the bernoulli equation @xmath157 and just behind the shock itself the jump conditions give the velocity , density and pressure as @xmath158 evaluating @xmath159 from the jump conditions and substituting gives @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 . neglecting the first term ( i.e the kinetic energy ) , @xmath163 and hence @xmath164 .",
    "these results are exact for @xmath165 . in this approximation ,",
    "the density decreases monatonically with increasing radial distance , and @xmath166 defined above is @xmath167 .",
    "we note that for @xmath99 , close to the shock , the density may increase with increasing radial distance , i.e. a postshock rarefaction exists . for @xmath46",
    ", this region extends between @xmath168 , and disappears for @xmath169 .",
    "we recapitulate and modify very slightly the approach of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath170 be the amplitudes of the @xmath128 oscillations of the accretion shock . then at the accretion shock , @xmath171 , which comes from the radial variation of the shock ram pressure .",
    "we follow @xcite and neglect the term in @xmath172 , which renders the perturbation isothermal . @xcite",
    "also comment that the term in @xmath172 is smaller by a factor of a few than the term in @xmath173 in determining the shock ram pressure .",
    "hence @xmath174 where @xmath175 , and the subscript @xmath176 indicates that this is evaluated at the outer shock .      the interior boundary , and hence the boundary conditions here , are less well defined in our model .",
    "we are assuming that the region where strong neutrino cooling sets in and causes the accreting matter to decouple from the hot postshock flow will give a boundary from which waves can reflect .",
    "@xcite , considering a plane parallel shock , assume a constant pressure boundary condition , @xmath184 .",
    "we assume something similar ; @xmath185 we do not take the local value of @xmath166 in this boundary condition , but take the same value as assumed above at the forward shock , modified by a constant @xmath112 which we vary to find the best match to the @xmath52 stability . in any case ,",
    "@xmath186 as it must be , because the background density increases significantly over that predicted by the bernoulli model due to radiative cooling by neutrino emission .",
    "we prefer to cast the interior boundary condition in terms of @xmath166 and @xmath15 evaluated at the outer shock , because of the algebraic simplification it produces , and the somewhat easier conditions required to keep the @xmath52 mode stable .",
    "it is clear from the work of various authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that this must be true .",
    "these last two references , in particular , include considerably more physics , and are able to predict the shock radius , rather than just specifying it as we do , but they only treat radial stability .",
