    "as the prototypical many - body phenomenon , the kondo effect@xcite has attracted much attention for decades , and it still occupies a central role for the understanding of many frontier problems of condense matter physics . dealing with the interaction between a localized spin and delocalized conduction electrons , the kondo effect has a characteristic energy scale@xcite @xmath2 which is defined as the kondo temperature at which kondo conductance has decreased from its extrapolated zero - temperature height to half of this value . by using @xmath2 as dimensionless unit , many physical phenomena can exhibit universal scaling relations@xcite which offer a shortcut to grasp the intrinsic kondo picture .",
    "one type of scaling analysis occurs when an external magnetic field is applied to magnetic impurity systems ( or quantum dot ( qd ) @xcite ) : the splitting of zero - bias kondo conductance peak depends universally only on @xmath7 under a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "that is to say , in a wide magnetic field window , after rescaling treatment all splittings under different parameters @xmath4 will follow the same path with @xmath7 as the scaling variable .",
    "such magnetic field window can extend in theory from zero field up to fields @xmath8,@xcite whereas in experimental measurements@xcite magnetic fields rarely exceed @xmath9 .",
    "for example , a detailed investigation in kondo regime , in particular for larger fields at around @xmath10 , has been made in the work by rosch et al.@xcite these scaling properties are believed within the kondo regime to be universal and can not be affected by system parameters , although such magnetic - field - induced nonequilibrium effect has not reached to the level of the equilibrium kondo effect .",
    "very recently , liu et al@xcite found large deviations from the conventional universal scaling analysis in the measurement of kondo differential conductance peak splitting @xmath11 of a qd device .",
    "when adjusting @xmath2 in two different paths ( i.e. via energy level @xmath12 or the coupling strength @xmath13 ) , they found that the splitting @xmath11 also presented two different trends with the increment of @xmath2 at a larger magnetic field @xmath14 , far beyond the traditional scaling theory@xcite in kondo effect .",
    "such specific experimental results indicate that the scaling characteristic may encounter breakdown in certain situations , while all previous theories@xcite indicate that scaling analysis is independent on the path of adjusting @xmath2 even at a larger @xmath14 .",
    "consequently it occurs to us that : does @xmath2 remain suitable as the dimensionless scaling unit , especially in a larger magnetic field situation ?",
    "therefore , a careful theoretical examination of the scaling relation and its universal characteristic under an external magnetic field is in great need .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed investigation of scaling in the magnetic field induced splitting of the kondo resonance in a kondo qd , whose universal characters are examined by adjusting @xmath2 in two different paths ( i.e. : via @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) . by using the full density matrix numerical renormalization group@xcite ( fdm - nrg ) , we perform precise calculations of the splitting of magnetic - field - induced kondo peak in the total spectral function ( denoted as @xmath11 ) as well as in the spin - resolved spectral function ( denoted as @xmath15 ) .",
    "the fdm - nrg method has many advantages compared to the conventional way used in previous works@xcite , such as the complete basis set , the rigorous holding of the sum rules for the spectral function , and less sensitivity of the results to the number of kept states .",
    "such new features make our results more accurate than those from the previous studies .    from the numerical results , we find that the splitting @xmath15 in the spin - resolved spectral function shows perfect universal scaling characteristic no matter which path is taken to adjust @xmath2 as long as the magnetic field @xmath14 is less than @xmath16 . for large fields @xmath14 ( e.g. @xmath3 )",
    ", deviations to scaling are found .",
    "for the spin - averaged situation ( corresponding to total spectral function ) , small deviations of @xmath11 from universal scaling characteristic always exist along the @xmath13-varying path as long as the magnetic field is applied .",
    "furthermore , we also fit the scaling curves ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) for both splittings @xmath4 ( by averaging out to eliminate small deviation ) and @xmath0 .",
    "the fitting curves @xmath17 and @xmath18 have the following characteristics : ( 1 ) the fitting curves @xmath17 has a threshold value at about @xmath19 , while @xmath18 is always non - zero under a field @xmath7 .",
    "( 2 ) in the low field ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath17 exhibits the linear behavior with the slope coefficient @xmath21 which is consistent to @xmath22 from the fermi liquid theory .",
    "( 3 ) two curves @xmath17 and @xmath18 get far away with one another and they do not merge into a single curve in the large magnetic field region .",
    "in addition , the dimensionless scaling quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 are also investigated and we find that they can reach and exceed 1 when magnetic field is large enough , in agreement with a recent experiment.@xcite    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ nrg ] we introduce our model and the fdm - nrg method . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we show numerical results of the magnetic - field - induced scaling argument .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] gives the conclusion .",
    "we consider the single - impurity anderson model ( siam)@xcite , and the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath23 in the above hamiltonian , the fermion operator @xmath24 denotes the band states of leads with energy @xmath25 and spin @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 describes the impurity states with energy @xmath12 ; @xmath29 corresponds to the coulomb interaction between two electrons with different spin embedded at the impurity site , and h.c . denotes",
    " hermitian cojugate \" .",
    "besides , @xmath30 indicates different leads @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the coupling between two subsystems .",
    "accordingly , the hybridization function between subsystems is given by : @xmath34 we can see that @xmath35 , as well as @xmath13 , will be constant in the broadband limits ( adopted henceforth ) .    by using the canonical transformation : @xmath36 we can see only the even combination of left and right electron states @xmath37 couples to the local impurity state : @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "there are many ways to solve siam , such as the slave - boson mean - field theory , the bethe ansatz approach , the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method , _ etc _ , among which the wilson s nrg method@xcite has been proven to be an efficient and powerful tool to deal with impurity system@xcite , especially to obtain its kondo features . if we are only interested in the transport properties , there are standard procedures to make use of nrg method :    * discretization of continuous hamiltonian and its mapping to a semi - infinite chain ; * iterative diagonalization of the chain and yield of flow of many - particle levels ; * calculation of dynamic properties , such as the spectral functions .",
    "the first two steps can be easily accomplished by following ref .",
    "[ ] , and finally the hamiltonian becomes :    [ eq3 ] @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the logarithmic discretization parameter , @xmath42 is also the hybridization function between impurity subsystem and leads subsystem .",
    "@xmath43 is the starting point of the above sequence of hamiltonians eq .",
    "from which an iteration procedure can be established .",
    "@xmath44 , denoting the hopping term between two neighbor sites along the chain , has an exponential decreasing feature with increasing @xmath45 and reduces to @xmath46 in the limit of large @xmath45 .",
    "is obtained , there are many ways available to derive dynamic properties by calculating impurity spectral function in the lehmann representation . within the past few years ,",
    "the developments of nrg method , extending its application range to various subjects including the bosonic@xcite and time - dependent@xcite situations , are mainly in the subject of dynamic properties .",
    "these successive improvements of nrg method , including the reduced density matrix ( dm)@xcite , the complete set of states combined with the reduced density matrix idea ( cfs)@xcite , and most recently the full density matrix together the complete set of eliminated states ( fdm)@xcite , have great advantages compared to the conventional way@xcite , especially the last development fdm - nrg , which is far ahead of the conventional method , exceeds in many aspects , such as dealing with the impurity problem under an external magnetic field , describing spectral features at finite temperature with high accuracy , holding the sum rules of spectral function rigorously , using a complete basis set , less sensitivity of the results to the number of kept states , _",
    "etc_.    by using the fdm - nrg method , completeness relation reads as follows@xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes total length of the semi - infinite chain , @xmath49 is the first site at which states are discarded . @xmath50 and @xmath51 , in which @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the kept and discarded states of the @xmath54th iteration shell respectively , and @xmath55 represents the set of 4 states in the @xmath54th site along wilson s chain ( i.e. : @xmath56 ) ; thus @xmath57 can be seen as kept and discarded states of the @xmath54th shell containing all information of whole system @xmath58 rather than only its first @xmath54 sites .",
    "therefore , such treating technique naturally involves the influence of  environment\"@xcite .",
    "the next step is to make use of complete basis of set eq . to solve the retarded green s function which is given by : @xmath59\\ ] ] where operators @xmath60 stand for @xmath61 respectively",
    ", @xmath62 is the standard anticommutation relation , and @xmath63 is the full density matrix : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath66th ( discarded ) eigenstate of @xmath45th iteration step , @xmath67 is relative weight holding the sum rule @xmath68 , and @xmath69 corresponds to the density matrix of each single shell @xmath45 : @xmath70 , in which @xmath71 is its distribution function containing only discarded states .",
    "noticeably , such full density matrix treatment , in contrast to the  single - shell approximation \" of cfs - nrg method , is the spirit of fdm - nrg method .    substituting the completeness relation eq . into the retarded green s function eq . and following the work by peter et al@xcite",

    "such matrix elements can be obtained within iteration process . besides , @xmath78_{k , k^\\prime}\\equiv\\sum\\limits_e\\ _ m^k\\langle k , e|\\rho_n|k^\\prime , e\\rangle_m^k$ ] are elements of the @xmath45th component of reduced density matrix of the shell @xmath79 . noticeably , eq . is an equivalent formulation of the fdm green function which is identical to that in ref .",
    "we rewrite this result in a similar form as in the work by peter et al@xcite in order to reduce the time cost when processing calculation ; furthermore , eq . can be easily reduced to the result in ref .",
    "[ ] by applying the single - shell approximation @xmath80 , thus it provides an intuitional comparison between fdm - nrg method and cfs - nrg method in the final result .    by using eq .",
    ", we can calculate the retarded green s function of impurity , and consequently all dynamic properties can be obtained straightforwardly . for instance , the spectral functions can be obtained at once : @xmath81 such treatment yields a discrete spectral function rather than a smooth one , and this problem can be overcome by using a broadening function for each single @xmath11 peak . the kernel function in this paper",
    "has a similar form as the one proposed by weichselbaum and delft@xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are relative parameters and their values are fixed in practical calculation at a certain temperature @xmath84 : @xmath85 .",
    "noticeable , since @xmath86 is independent on parameter @xmath87 , thus the above broadening function make our spectral function hold sum rule identically on the algorithms , also at finite field @xmath14 and finite temperature @xmath84 .",
    "since the broadening of @xmath11 function occurs only in the last step of nrg method for spectral function calculation , thus the influence of broadening on the splitting of kondo - peak is actually the approximation that we use a smooth distribution function to replace the discrete @xmath11 function so that we can obtain smooth spectral functions .",
    "there are many logarithmic features in kondo effect , thus the logarithmic gaussian broadening function @xmath88 is suitable for describing kondo effect as well as certain features . as the analysis in ref .",
    "[ ] , the kernel broadening function eq . can give the most accurate smooth spectral functions than ever and it also has many advantages such as @xmath88 is symmetric under @xmath89 for the choice @xmath90 .    noticeably , although we adopted fdm - nrg method@xcite here , it is equivalent to cfs - nrg method@xcite in this paper , because the investigation on magnetic - field - induced scaling analysis in kondo regime shown below is totally in the zero temperature case where fdm - nrg method naturally becomes cfs - nrg method . therefore , the kernel broadening function eq .",
    "( i.e. : mixture of gaussian and logarithmic gaussian ) is not actually used in this paper , but only the logarithmic gaussian function @xmath88 works .",
    "consequently the accuracy of our results is determined by @xmath88 , and such accuracy has been enough to grasp kondo picture and describe precise kondo features .",
    "what s more , there is another technique to improve the accuracy : the @xmath91 averaging@xcite , through which we can remove certain oscillations in spectral functions . in this paper",
    "we also adopt the @xmath91-averaging treatment in order to increase accuracy of our results .    finally , by using eqs .",
    ", and we can calculate the impurity spectral function @xmath92 accurately and exactly , from which the kondo physics can be derived with great interest .",
    "specifically these expressions are very helpful for investigating the magnetic - field - induced scaling features shown below .    here",
    "we have to pinpoint one difference . in practical experiments",
    "people usually measure how the splitting of kondo conductance peak , which is extracted in the conductance @xmath93 versus the bias @xmath94 curve , varies with the increment of magnetic field , as done in the work by liu et al@xcite for example .",
    "by contrast , we investigate the magnetic - field - induced splitting in spectral functions and keep the fermi energy of left and right leads aligned with each other , i.e. : @xmath95 . the two treatments are equivalent to one another in studying the kondo scaling features under a magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the splitting of kondo peak in spectral functions is also experimentally measurable , e.g. , by using an extra weak probe terminal@xcite .",
    "and @xmath96 and the total spectral functions @xmath97 versus the energy @xmath87 at the magnetic field @xmath98 .",
    "( b ) shows the changes of the kondo peak positions @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 and the splittings @xmath11 and @xmath15 with the increment of magnetic field @xmath14 , with the inset as its magnification in a low magnetic field window .",
    "the parameters of siam for ( a ) and ( b ) are the same : @xmath103 , and @xmath104 with its kondo temperature @xmath105 ; nrg parameters : @xmath106 , and @xmath107 . ]",
    "we calculate the spin - resolved spectral functions @xmath108 and total spectral function @xmath97 by using eqs . , and of fdm - nrg method .",
    "in equilibrium situation without an applied magnetic field , there are three peaks coming out in spectral functions , among which two peaks correspond to the energy level at @xmath109 , while the third one corresponds to kondo resonance peak roughly at the fermi level @xmath110 . under an external magnetic field @xmath14 ,",
    "however , the kondo resonance peak will splits into two separate peaks as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) .",
    "these peak positions , denoted as @xmath111 in the spin - averaged case and @xmath112 in the spin - resolved case , can be extracted from spectral functions at the maximum values which can be determined by analyzing derivatives . through scanning a certain region , which contains two stagnation points related to the splittings , by using binary search method , the splitting positions can be localized with high precision . in our calculation , this precision reaches @xmath113 .",
    "the splittings @xmath11 and @xmath15 are then given by @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "in the particle - hole symmetry case ( i.e. : @xmath116 ) , these peaks are symmetry corresponding to the fermi energy @xmath110 .",

    "second , the @xmath11-@xmath14 curve can be seen as linear in a low field window while the @xmath15-@xmath14 curve deviates from this feature .",
    "third , with increasing field @xmath14 , the two curves do not get closer to each other , conversely they become far away from one another .",

    "[ figure2 ] ( a ) and ( c ) , we can see the raw data extracted directly from spectral functions changing gradually along parameter - dependent paths , either in the spin - resolved case or in the spin - average case .",
    "it means that if we change some parameters , the evolution of the splittings @xmath15 and @xmath11 vs @xmath14 will go along another different path at once .",
    "however , after scaling treatment by using kondo scale @xmath2 as the dimensionless unit , these changes of all splittings with increasing @xmath14 surprisingly go along the same path , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( b ) and ( d ) . such feature , which is called the scaling characteristic of kondo effect , is the main subject under detailed investigation in this paper . from the results of fig.2 ( b ) and ( d )",
    ", the scaling characteristic will work well for magnetic field @xmath126 .",
    "whereas with magnetic field getting larger some deviations appear , because the system has been driven closer to the kondo regime in a larger @xmath14 region .",
    "when the magnetic field @xmath14 is larger than @xmath127 , in which kondo effect has been suppressed badly and the qd system is out of kondo regime , obvious deviations in both of splittings @xmath11 and @xmath15 are exhibited and the scaling theory wo nt be obeyed .    in order to clearly show that the system indeed is out of kondo regime when the magnetic field @xmath14 is larger than @xmath128 , we plot the curves @xmath129 and @xmath130 versus @xmath7 by varying @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ figadd ] ) . here",
    "it can be seen clearly that the deviation ( i.e. : the non - universal features ) are pushed to much larger field @xmath14 with decreasing @xmath13 , and in addition no deviations from scaling are found in a low field @xmath14 . as a result ,",
    "the deviations from scaling found at larger field @xmath3 are indeed due to leaving the kondo regime . in the following ,",

    "the splitting @xmath11 has an obvious threshold field value at around @xmath19 , by contrast we ca nt see such threshold field in the @xmath0 vs @xmath7 curve .",

    ", we can consider the scaling feature as an effective characteristic yet .",
    "for the spin - resolved case , ignoring the larger field region where system has been driven closer to or out of kondo regime , the filed - induced splitting @xmath0 scales perfectly for magnetic fields all the time .",
    "but for the spin - averaged case , we ca nt ignore such a fact that evolution of splittings @xmath4 with the increment of @xmath7 do nt go along exactly the same path , as is seen in inset of ( a ) . furthermore , we find that such slight deviation always exists as long as the magnetic field is applied in system , and a larger field window is not necessary to reveal this feature along the @xmath13 varying path .",
    "the reason for inducing such deviation can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) where the spectral functions under two specific coupling strength @xmath104 and @xmath133 ( denoted by using subscripts @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively ) are shown . since the magnetic field is the only factor inducing kondo peak splitting as mentioned above , the splitting positions @xmath148 and @xmath149 should be dependent only on field @xmath14 and @xmath2 . along the @xmath12 varying path",
    ", we have seen that @xmath0 scales perfectly , and here we see this effect also works well along the @xmath13 varying path : as shown in fig.[figure3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , the positions @xmath138 of the kondo peak under two different coupling strength are indeed nearly the same . on the other hand , the positions @xmath150 in the spin - averaged case are not so luck like the one in spin - resolved case .",
    "certain parameters can really influence specific shape of spectral function and the high of kondo peak ( although the kondo - peak position keeps fixed ) , and this makes the peak positions of total spectral functions shift a little towards fermi energy ( i.e. : @xmath110 ) with increasing coupling strength @xmath13 as shown in fig.[figure3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "here is in the place to pinpoint that such effect occurs as long as @xmath14 is applied , that s to say the deviation from conventional scaling analysis will be observed under any value of external magnetic field , although this deviation is usually small ( within @xmath151 in our parameters , see the inset of fig.[figure3 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this result is consonant with the experimental work by liu et al@xcite in some aspects that the coupling strength can indeed induce deviation from scaling theory , but moreover our work indicates that such deviation occurs all the time along @xmath13 varying path , rather than localized in a larger field window .    another possible way , which explains why @xmath13 can induce the small deviation from scaling theory , is to investigate kondo peak positions shown in fig . [ figure3 ] ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "in present situation , the system remains symmetry ( @xmath152 ) and thus these peak positions keep symmetry as well corresponding to the fermi energy @xmath110 .",
    "the kondo - peak positions @xmath138 in the spin - resolved case keep nearly the same with changing @xmath13 while the magnetic field @xmath153 , thus @xmath0-@xmath7 curve fits the scaling theory well in this field window . in the spin - averaged case , however , the peak position @xmath139 slightly deviates with changing @xmath13 .",

    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( a ) we exhibit the comparison between fitting curves and raw data extracted directly from the spectral functions .",
    "such fitting curves are given by @xmath165 with the parameters : @xmath166 . from fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( a ) we can see the fitting curves fit numerical data very well in whole magnetic window , including a low field below the conventional threshold value @xmath19 . thus we can study some detailed features in a low field with the help of fitting curves .",
    "for example , the splitting @xmath11 in spin - averaged case does have a threshold magnetic field at around @xmath19 as is seen in ( e ) , and this result is in quantitative agreement with previous theories@xcite .",
    "what s more , by using fitting curve @xmath167 we find out that in a low magnetic field the curve @xmath0 vs @xmath7 likes the power function and the first derivative of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath7 is always zero at the zero - field point .",
    "when magnetic field @xmath14 is in the vicinity of @xmath2 , the curves @xmath167 and @xmath168 exhibit the linear behaviors : @xmath169 with the parameters : @xmath170 . in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( d ) , we show the curves @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 together .",
    "it clearly shows that @xmath173 is well consistent with @xmath174 . in particular",
    ", the coefficients @xmath175 of the slope of the curve @xmath172 is @xmath176 , which is nearly the same as @xmath22 derived through fermi liquid theory.@xcite    on the other hand , in the high magnetic field region , the two curves @xmath177 and @xmath178 do not close , whereas they get far away with the increment of @xmath14 .",
    "this result is quite surprise . generally speaking it",
    "is believed that splittings @xmath0 and @xmath4 in the spin - resolved and spin - averaged cases should reach the limit of zeeman splitting under a large enough magnetic field , thus the two scaling curves @xmath177 and @xmath178 should get closer to one another rather than far away with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the key point for the getting far away behavior is that the peak position @xmath119 always falls in the region where its second derivative of spin - down spectral function @xmath179 with respect to @xmath180 is negative ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( b ) ( c ) and ( d ) we show other scaling features investigated by previous works.@xcite @xmath6 is another scaling dimensionless quantity and has been predicted to reach the limit value @xmath146 ( i.e. the splitting of the kondo peak is equal to the zeeman splitting ) in the large magnetic field @xmath14 limits.@xcite whereas in recent experiments , such the limit value can be exceeded@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( b ) , we show the evolution of @xmath6 vs the magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical results clearly exhibit that @xmath6 can reach and exceed 1 , which is in agreement with the recent experiments@xcite . in addition , in the large field window",
    ", the curve of @xmath6-@xmath7 shows the logarithmic behavior.@xcite this behavior can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( c ) , in which the curve of @xmath6-@xmath181 is shown .",
    "in conclusion , by using the fdm - nrg method we study the scaling characteristics of the kondo - peak splittings in a quantum dot system under a magnetic field .",
    "similarly as in the recent experiment,@xcite two different ways to adjust the kondo scale @xmath2 , via the energy level @xmath12 and the coupling strength @xmath13 , are considered . both splittings @xmath15 and @xmath11 of kondo resonant peaks in the spin - resolved spectral function and the total spectral function are investigated in detail .",
    "we find that the splitting @xmath0 in the spin - resolved case always scales perfectly for magnetic fields @xmath1 and regardless of the @xmath2-adjusted paths .",
    "when the magnetic field @xmath14 is over @xmath182 , obvious deviations are exhibited since qd system has been out of the kondo regime .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath4 in the total spectral function , which can be related to the experiments by liu et al@xcite , deviates slightly from the conventional scaling theory along the @xmath13-varying path .",
    "such result is consonant with the experimental work by liu et al in some aspects , i.e. : the coupling strength can indeed induce deviation from scaling theory , but moreover our work indicates that such deviation occurs all the time as long as an external magnetic field is applied .",
    "therefore @xmath2 is an unsuitable parameter as the scaling dimensionless unit in this situation .",
    "since the deviation in the splitting @xmath4 is usually small , we can still make the scaling analysis for @xmath4 .",
    "the fitting curves ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) for both splittings @xmath4 and @xmath0 are presented .",
    "the fitting curves @xmath17 has a threshold value at around @xmath19 , but @xmath18 is always non - zero while under the field @xmath7 . in the low field ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath17 exhibits the linear behavior with its slope coefficient @xmath21 , consistent with the value of @xmath22 from the fermi liquid theory . on the large field side , two curves @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 get apart , and both @xmath5 and @xmath6 can reach and exceed 1 , which is also in agreement with a recent experiments .",
