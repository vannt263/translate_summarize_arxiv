    "self - organization of a long - lived structure ( inhomogeneity of physical quantities ) is often observed in macroscopic systems governed by long - range interactions such as gravity ( creating astronomical systems like galaxies@xcite ) , electromagnetic force ( creating plasma systems like magnetospheres@xcite or particle traps@xcite ) , or magnetic interaction ( hamiltonian mean - field systems modeling magnetism@xcite ) .",

    "however , the consistency of the density distribution ( dictated by the statistical mechanics of particles ) and the electric potential ( dictated by the field equation ) relies heavily on the specialty of the homogeneous longitudinal magnetic field . here",

    "however , the density is no longer homogeneous .",
    "the aim of this study is to reveal the underlying principle that governs generalized relaxed states .",
    "confinement of charged particles ( especially antimatter particles ) in a toroidal magnetic bottle has many advantages , for example , making possible to confine high - energy particles produced by isotopes or accelerators , or to confine different spices of positive and negative charges simultaneously @xcite .",
    "here we invoke the theory of phase - space foliation ( or , topological constraint ) , and define a relaxed state as a thermal equilibrium on a leaf of phase space@xcite . in the present argument , the adiabatic invariants of magnetized particles embody such foliated phase space . in an axisymmetric magnetic field ,",
    "magnetized particles have three different adiabatic invariants , i.e. , the magnetic moment @xmath0 , the action @xmath1 of bounce motion , and the action ( canonical angular momentum ) @xmath2 of the toroidal drift@xcite ; see fig.[orbit ] .",
