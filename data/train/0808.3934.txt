    "since about a decade @xcite there has been a development in the condensed matter community where a novel approach to the simulation of statistical models was pioneered .",
    "one replaces the original partition function given by a sum over certain field configurations by its untruncated series representation , usually the strong coupling or hopping parameter expansion . for any finite but arbitrarily sized system",
    "this is regarded as an alternative statistical system that is simulated by a novel monte carlo technique .",
    "originally the method has emerged in quantum models that are ` made classical ' by using the trotter formula which leads to world - line type formalisms . in @xcite",
    "the approach was used for classical spin systems in two and three dimensions . in our opinion",
    "this idea is very useful also for investigating systems of interest to lattice field theory and elementary particle physics and it might be applicable in suitably generalized form even to fermions and gauge models",
    ". ultimately it could perhaps enable steps toward the long sought generalization of @xcite beyond infinite coupling .    in this publication that is planned to be the first of a series",
    ", we concentrate our numerical experiments on the 2@xmath0 ising model as a prototype system .",
    "while the extension to abelian scalar bosonic theories in any @xmath0 seems straight - forward  some cases can already be found in @xcite  other generalizations will be non - trivial .",
    "the purpose of this paper , apart from some reformulation ,  is on the one hand to introduce an important generalization of biasing the sampling of the series . on the other hand",
    "a more detailed investigation of the behavior of some observables of interest and their comparison with standard methods is made .",
    "it should have become clear above that we are not discussing just a new monte carlo algorithm but an exact reformulation where physical observables have completely different estimators , variances and autocorrelations which deserve study .",
    "another study of the worm algorithm in the ising model was recently presented in @xcite .",
    "there a detailed study of the monte carlo dynamics is given refining results in @xcite .",
    "while we confirm the practical absence of critical slowing down on our lattices , we here do not attempt to determine dynamical critical exponents .    for a first closer look at the method we define @xmath1 here @xmath2 denote sites of a cubic periodic lattice in arbitrary dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the outer sum is over ising configurations @xmath3 , in the exponent we sum over all links @xmath4 .",
    "this is the numerator of the two point function that may be written as @xmath5 with an arbitrary lattice site @xmath6 .",
    "generalizing @xcite we consider a new partition function @xmath7 the pairs of sites @xmath8 are now the ` phase space ' and @xmath9 is a weight function demanded to possess the lattice periodicity .",
    "constant positive factors in @xmath10 will be irrelevant and we adopt the normalization condition at the origin @xmath11 now the two point function is given by @xmath12 where the double bracket @xmath13 denotes averages with respect to ( [ zuv ] ) @xmath14 for observables @xmath15 .",
    "note that any dependence of mean values on the weight @xmath10 is canceled in ( [ gest ] ) , but statistical errors will depend on it .    to actually simulate ( [ zuv ] )",
    "we need @xmath16 as weights which are not available in closed form .",
    "inserting ( [ zs ] ) and enlarging the phase space to @xmath17 would lead to oscillating over - all weights and would not be useful . instead here the strong coupling expansion may be inserted . in a somewhat sketchy notation , that will become more precise later",
    ", we put @xmath18 here the strong coupling expansion of the ising model is written in powers of @xmath19 and @xmath20 is an unimportant constant .",
    "the set of strong coupling graphs contributing to ( [ zs ] ) is named @xmath21 and for each element @xmath22 of the set @xmath23 denotes the degree in @xmath19 of this contribution .",
    "of course @xmath21 includes disconnected graphs that may wind around the torus etc .",
    "if we insert this representation into ( [ zuv ] ) we may consider @xmath24 } as phase space points that may now be sampled probabilistically to estimate @xmath25 .",
    "the very important result of @xcite is that it is almost trivial to design an ergodic update from _ joint essentially local moves _ of  @xmath24 } under which observables as those appearing in ( [ gest ] ) are even ( almost ) free of critical slowing down .",
    "local here means in particular that in each step @xmath22 is deformed only in a minimal way close @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "a detailed description of the moves will follow .",
    "for the graphs of the usual partition function ( vacuum graphs ) alone an ergodic update procedure would be more complicated , it is easier in the enlarged setup . at the same time",
    "( [ gest ] ) shows that the extended moves produce information on the two point function if we record the occurring @xmath28 in a histogram .",
    "it may seem surprising that local moves can ( almost ) eliminate critical slowing down .",
    "but this prejudice is of course based on the idea of sampling spin configurations that are long distance correlated . here",
    "as one approaches criticality , bigger strong coupling graphs will be important and apparently the algorithm ` knows ' this and may even be guided in addition by choosing @xmath10 appropriately .",
    "there also is an important difference with regard to internal symmetries , the spin flip z(2 ) in the ising case .",
    "spin - flip odd observables can not be addressed anymore .",
    "the contributing graphs reflect the symmetry manifestly and the field variables that transform under the symmetry have been summed over .",
    "this should not be seen as a drawback : in the ideal situation of knowing the exact solution this would be the same .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in 2 .",
    "we derive the dimer form of the ising model that explicitly parametrizes all strong coupling graphs .",
    "in addition the update for this system is defined . in 3 .",
    "some numerical results are collected and discussed .",
    "we end in 4 . on conclusions and an outlook , where we offer some speculations on the possibilities to generalize this reformulation and its simulation in various directions .",
    "for a single ising bond the trivial identity @xmath29^k\\ ] ] holds . using it on each link  with independent dimer or bond variables @xmath30 we rewrite ( [ zs ] ) ( up to the factor @xmath31 inserted for convenience ) as @xmath32^{k_l } s ( u ) s ( v)\\ ] ] with the number of links ( sites ) @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the notation @xmath35 has been replaced by the boundary set @xmath36 .",
    "next , the spins are summed over and leave behind the constraint @xmath37^{k_l } s ( u )    s ( v ) = \\theta ( k ; u , v ) \\in \\{0 , 1\\}.\\ ] ] the result @xmath38 factorizes into local constraints with @xmath39 and their complements @xmath40 combining to @xmath41 in words : if @xmath42 holds , the number of dimers touching at any site has to be even . for @xmath43 ,",
    "these two sites have to be surrounded by an odd number of dimers with all other sites being even .",
    "the previous steps coincide with those made in a duality transformation @xcite . there , usually with no insertion ( or @xmath44",
    ", one would solve the constraint by expressing @xmath45 by ( the dual of ) the discrete ` exterior derivative ' @xcite of a @xmath46 ` form ' on the dual lattice , yielding self - duality for @xmath47 , the dual gauge theory for @xmath48 , etc .",
    "for the algorithm @xcite , however , we stay with the constrained @xmath49 , in a sense intermediate between the original ising model and its dual .",
    "the partition function of the enlarged ensemble now reads @xmath50 where the dimer sum together with the constraint uniquely label the graphs @xmath51 and the total dimer number equals @xmath23 .",
    "the coupling has been traded for the dimer chemical potential @xmath52 , @xmath53 mean values of observables @xmath54 , which may now also depend on @xmath45 , are given by @xmath55    simple diagnostic observables for first monte carlo experiments are the internal energy , or equivalently the average nearest neighbor correlation @xmath56 and the susceptibility @xmath57 where we sum over all directions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the corresponding unit lattice vectors .",
    "the transcription of @xmath60 is obvious , @xmath61 thus , in particular for @xmath62 , the fraction of coinciding @xmath42 has a simple interpretation and vanishes for @xmath63 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the corresponding translation for @xmath64 is @xmath65 alternatively it may be related to the mean dimer occupancy in the subset @xmath66 by differentiating @xmath67 with respect to @xmath68 @xmath69      with the algorithm only .",
    "] of @xcite we sample the ensemble ( [ zens ] ) .",
    "the name of the algorithm presumably derives from the fact that the constraint @xmath70 requires a line of active dimers ( @xmath71 ) connecting the ends @xmath8 of the worm .",
    "however the connecting sequence of links is not unique , the worm is ` fuzzy ' so to speak with fixed head and tail only .",
    "we therefore prefer the name ps - algorithm honoring its inventors .",
    "in any case the ps algorithm exploits the fact that we can base an ergodic monte carlo algorithm for the ensemble ( [ zens ] ) on merely the following two types of simple elementary steps that we apply in alternating order :    * type i : we pick one of the @xmath72 nearest neighbors of @xmath27 with equal probability and call it @xmath73 and the connecting link @xmath4 .",
    "the proposed move @xmath74 with the simultaneous adjustment @xmath75 is accepted with the metropolis probability @xmath76 otherwise the old configuration is maintained . the practical implementation is largely based on precomputed tables .",
    "it is not necessary to also move @xmath26 due to translation invariance . *",
    "type ii : if we encounter a configuration @xmath77 with @xmath42 we ` kick ' @xmath42 together to a randomly chosen other lattice site with unchanged @xmath49 with the probability @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath79 we do nothing in this step , which is the dominant case .",
    "each such i - ii step requires o(1 ) operations , independent of the lattice size .",
    "we call this compound a micro - step . for a sequence of @xmath80 micro - steps ergodicity can be shown .",
    "any two configurations may be connected with non - zero probability by the ` worm dismantling ' all active dimers of the first configuration and then ` re - building ' the second one .",
    "the jumps allow to move from one connected component to the next . as usual in ergodicity proofs , this is in general of course a rather academic process !",
    "following @xcite we employ @xmath81 . some brief numerical experiments with values 0.3 and 0.7 showed that this has hardly any influence .",
    "metropolis acceptance rates in steps i were reasonably far from the extreme values 0 and 1 in all our simulations below , usually between 0.5 and 0.6 . in @xcite",
    "it has been observed that a correct and efficient algorithm can even be based on steps of type i alone ( @xmath82 ) which we have however not tried here .",
    "we group together @xmath34 micro - steps calling this an iteration , during which we accumulate a sub - histogram of occurring separations @xmath83 this may be interpreted as measuring the whole set of 1-bit observables @xmath84 ",
    "one for each separation  @xmath6  after each micro - step , mostly implicit zeros , of course .",
    "thus we always measure and never give away any information .",
    "such an iteration has a computational complexity comparable to a sweep in standard algorithms .",
    "we separately record the contributions to primary observables from each such iteration .",
    "these records are treated as a usual time series and an autocorrelation analysis as described in @xcite is made .",
    "most physically interesting observables are of the derived type , nonlinear functions , typically ratios , of primaries , see ( [ gest ] ) .",
    "details on their error estimation , including the definition of integrated autocorrelation times for such functions , can also be found in @xcite .",
    "we only repeat here that in our definition @xmath85 is the ratio between the true and the ` naive ' error .",
    "although this is wide - spread , there are alternative definitions in the literature that may coincide with this one only for large @xmath86 , a case not relevant here .",
    "the tests below are in @xmath47 using lattices of size @xmath87 , but they are expected to be representative for larger @xmath0 , too .",
    "results for @xmath60 in the form ( [ chiob ] ) and @xmath64 from both ( [ e1ob ] ) and ( [ e2ob ] ) are reported . for each lattice size",
    "we have performed @xmath89 iterations after equilibration .",
    "the values are compatible for instance with @xcite and our results with integrated autocorrelation times are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we confirm the practically complete absence of critical slowing down for the observables under study .",
    ".values and integrated autocorrelation times for simulations at the critical point @xmath90 and various lattice sizes .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is instructive to compare the achieved precision with that of the single cluster simulations in combination with standard spin estimators that were reported in @xcite . the energy @xmath64 is a useful monitor for simulations but non - universal and not really of physical interest .",
    "we hence concentrate on @xmath60 which contains long distance contributions .",
    "we first compare the growth of @xmath91 here with the one quoted in @xcite for the single cluster algorithm ( 1c ) . while both algorithms are very fast , the ps simulations seem to have even smaller and less rising @xmath91 .",
    "does this automatically mean that ps is preferable for measuring @xmath60 ? as we estimate in a completely different ensemble also the variance can be quite different .",
    "in @xcite errors are quoted for @xmath60 together with the number of single cluster steps performed . using the average cluster size ( that actually equals @xmath60 )",
    "it is an easy exercise to predict the errors for a single cluster run of @xmath89 steps per spin , a cpu effort similar to the one in this study .",
    "taking @xmath92 as an example , the result is that the error on @xmath60 from a single cluster simulation would be about 6 times smaller .    due to the simplicity of the estimator ( [ chiob ] ) we immediately know the variance @xmath93 given the known final errors and the fact that we effectively measure after each micro - step",
    ", we can also conclude the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath94 in time units of micro - steps .",
    "it ranges from about @xmath95 for @xmath96 to @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "this means that an effectively independent estimate for @xmath99 arises after moving dimers ( modifying the strong coupling graphs ) in only a small part of the volume .",
    "the point is that we are discussing an _ integrated _ autocorrelation time and not _ the slowest mode_. our observable couples for instance only weekly to remote parts of the graph .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed above , taking into account also the variance , no miracle in terms of efficiency has happened ! in @xcite quite similar observations have been made for @xmath60 . in their comparison with the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm ps fares",
    "however somewhat better .",
    "we end this subsection by visualizing a typical contributing graph in figure [ config ] .",
    "one use of the generalization of arbitrarily biasing the ensemble @xmath100 with @xmath101 may be seen as follows .",
    "we assume to be able to guess an approximate form of the two point function ( up to a factor ) and use this for @xmath10 .",
    "then ( [ gest ] ) shows that the monte carlo produces an approximately @xmath6-independent correction factor that turns our guess into the exact correlation .",
    "this means , up to fluctuations and imperfections of our guess , all our counting - bins of occurring @xmath28 will have approximately equal filling . apart from autocorrelation effects",
    " which will be found to be minor  this means that the _ relative _ statistical error of correlations measured in this way will be @xmath102 with the number of iterations @xmath103 and essentially the same constant @xmath104 for all separations .",
    "this implies a constant signal to noise ratio independent of the size of the signal , a rather unusual situation .",
    "we first tested this mechanism in the critical model simulated before . the actual method to set @xmath10 was : in a first simulation with @xmath105 where we spent about 10% of the planned total statistics , we have measured @xmath106 after some equilibration .",
    "although not mandatory , we symmetrized the observed histogram ` by hand ' over the geometric lattice symmetries : reflections along the two directions and , if @xmath107 holds , cubic rotations .",
    "these symmetries were , of course , only violated by the statistical fluctuations . with this @xmath10",
    "we then performed the main simulation .",
    "we have indeed observed almost flat @xmath108 and compatibility with the known results .",
    "nevertheless there is no significant gain in precision which was not unexpected : at criticality , in a finite volume , the two point function does not decay exponentially but only by relatively moderate factors .",
    "the real strength of the possibility of biasing toward larger separations is expected in the massive disordered phase @xmath109 which we study next .      in many applications",
    "one is interested in low - lying eigenvalues of the transfer matrix .",
    "we pick a euclidean time direction and resolve the lattice site label into two - vectors @xmath110 labeling sites on a @xmath87 torus and work in lattice units , @xmath111 ( integer @xmath112 ) .",
    "we want to study the temporal decay of correlations at fixed spatial momentum @xmath113 @xmath114 it is not difficult to see that in the dimer representation it is given by @xmath115 in the present study we restrict ourselves to observing the mass gap and probe with @xmath116 only . moreover , we found by a short test that for this observable there is no disadvantage in letting @xmath10 only depend on time .",
    "then the correlation simplifies to @xmath117 we now need a guess of the time - slice correlation and use this for @xmath10 and have the monte carlo again only work out the corrections .",
    "it is sufficient to histogram only the time separations and in addition count coincidences @xmath66 , if the normalization is needed .  due to symmetry",
    "we may combine @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "below , instead of showing the correlation itself , we shall consider the time dependent effective mass .",
    "taking care of time periodicity we define @xmath120 by numerically solving for @xmath121 in @xmath122 which for @xmath123 is expected to plateau at the asymptotic mass - gap of the transfer matrix .",
    "this finite volume mass gap has a weak @xmath124-dependence and approaches the true gap for large @xmath125 .",
    "here we are not interested in this second limit but just work around @xmath126 and below @xmath88 .    for a test - bed with @xmath127",
    "we show in figure [ fig1 ] the effective mass from several simulations .",
    "the horizontal lines are the exactly known result from @xcite @xmath128 = 0.0841370 \\ldots .\\ ] ] each of the plots corresponds to @xmath89 steps per lattice site .",
    "the uppermost panel shows the standard situation in a favorable case .",
    "we have carried out @xmath89 sweeps of the swendsen - wang algorithm and have measured the standard spin - estimator . due to our large statistics and a well isolated spectrum , we see a clear plateau forming _ before _",
    "the errors explode at larger separation . as usual in such estimations , while the signal @xmath129 vanishes exponentially the variance remains essentially constant .",
    "this could in principle be improved by cluster estimators , but the signal to noise ratio would still vanish exponentially with @xmath118 , only at a slower rate .    in the next panel from above",
    "we see the result of a ps simulation with @xmath130 .",
    "the general impression is similar as before .",
    "the errors are somewhat larger at small @xmath118 and smaller at large @xmath118 . for the next simulation we have biased for a flat histogram using an analytical guess @xmath131 with a mass close to the expected one .",
    "we are rewarded with a completely uniform error independent of @xmath118 . in additional experiments we tried to over - sample long distances and",
    "have used @xmath132\\ ] ] which exponentially favors @xmath133 over @xmath134 by a factor @xmath135 .",
    "the bottom plot in figure [ fig1 ] shows the case @xmath136 .",
    "we indeed see even smaller errors at large @xmath118 ( about a factor 0.6 ) where systematic errors are smallest , a reversal of the standard situation where one usually has to compromise between systematics and statistics .",
    "the three ps runs took equal cpu time and the cluster simulation in our implementation was a factor two longer , all on a single pc .",
    "for extremely non - uniform choices of @xmath10 we expect to eventually run into a problem , because @xmath8 have to travel over the whole lattice including all separations for ergodicity .",
    "if one approaches such a case gradually , as we did varying @xmath137 , this should not set in abruptly but autocorrelation times should start to rise .",
    "for the case above , and even for @xmath138 , we have hardly seen such effects except that sometimes the summation window @xcite for the autocorrelation function , in particular for @xmath64 , had to be increased to capture its tail .",
    "all observed integrated autocorrelation times of effective masses were very close to @xmath139 in units of iterations .",
    "in addition we notice that in the ps data the errorbars jump around the exact line while the spin simulation results exhibit longer wavy structures .",
    "this indicates that the ps data from different time separations are statistically less dependent . averaging the effective mass over a range or performing a fit in some suitable window",
    "would probably reduce the error significantly .",
    "if we take the deviations from the known constant for say @xmath140 and the determined errors to form a @xmath141-value , we find reasonable values close to the number of data points entering .",
    "we do however not attempt to optimize the mass gap extraction any further here in this demonstration of principles .",
    "we have investigated the worm algorithm of prokofev and svistunov in the case of the @xmath19 expansion of the ising model .",
    "we emphasize that this involves a reformulation of the problem as a different statistical sum rather than just a new simulation algorithm to produce thermalized spin configurations .",
    "we confirm @xcite and @xcite to the effect that critical slowing down in practice is no issue for this method , at least in the case studied here .",
    "the important generalization of biased sampling ( @xmath142 allowed us to estimate the two point function in the disordered massive phase with a signal to noise ratio that does not decay with distance .",
    "even the contrary can be achieved .",
    "we expect that these features immediately generalize to other scalar models with abelian field variables , e.g. @xmath143 , z(@xmath103 ) clock models , u(1 ) xy - model , potts models in arbitrary dimension .",
    "a high precision study using the ps algorithm for the phenomenologically important xy model in @xmath48 was already presented in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the elimination of the sign - problem for bosons in a non - vanishing chemical potential by the ps - method is demonstrated . for correlations beyond two point functions",
    "one could consider more insertion points , perhaps with partially restricted domains .",
    "for non - abelian spin models like o(@xmath103 ) , rp(@xmath103 ) , cp(@xmath103 ) , @xmath144 the expansion and constraints are clearly more involved but hopefully still manageable .",
    "it should perhaps be kept in mind that for the continuum limit one is not confined to the standard actions of these models .",
    "an immediate generalization will be the world - line or loop - gas formulation of lattice fermions as presented in @xcite .",
    "a similar representation can be written for fermions in more than two dimensions .",
    "it will be all decisive for the future usefulness of the approach whether the sign - problem can be handled there . in two dimensions it is essentially absent and successful worm simulations",
    "have in fact already been reported @xcite .",
    "this will allow for the simulation of the o(@xmath103 ) invariant gross - neveu model where along the lines of @xcite we have encountered some problems with the measurement of interesting correlation functions .",
    "another important generalization would be lattice gauge theory .",
    "there the insertion of spin fields obviously should be generalized to wilson loop insertions and gauge invariance will be manifest term by term . in this way it will hopefully be possible to efficiently generate the strong coupling graphs .",
    "the closed surfaces of the vacuum graphs will be embedded in a larger class of graphs with surfaces with boundaries as discussed to some degree in @xcite . also here",
    "the abelian case will be much simpler than for example su(2 ) .",
    "first efforts towards a nonabelian dual formulation ( without so far employing a ps - type algorithm ) can be found in @xcite . the ultimate dream , of course , would be an efficient alternative simulation technique for full qcd . +",
