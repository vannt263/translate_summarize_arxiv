    "the on a generic smooth surface @xmath3 embedded in three - dimensional euclidean space consists of the points where @xmath3 has zero gaussian curvature .",
    "it separates ( where the curvature is positive ) from ( where the curvature is negative ) .",
    "these notions are well - defined for surfaces embedded in affine or even projective space , as the sign of gaussian curvature is invariant under affine transformations .    if the surface @xmath3 is expressed locally as the graph @xmath4 of a smooth function @xmath5 , then the sign of its hessian determinant @xmath6 equals the sign of its curvature at the corresponding point .",
    "thus the parabolic curve is the image under @xmath5 of its , which is defined by @xmath7 .",
    "when the surface @xmath3 is the graph of a polynomial @xmath8 $ ] , this local description is global , and so questions about the disposition of the parabolic curve on @xmath3 are equivalent to the same questions about the hessian curve in @xmath9 .",
    "suppose that @xmath10 is even .",
    "harnack proved  @xcite that a smooth plane curve of degree @xmath10 has at most @xmath11 connected components in @xmath12 .",
    "this is also the bound for the number of components of a compact curve in @xmath9 of degree @xmath10 .",
    "a non - compact curve in @xmath9 of degree @xmath10 can have at most @xmath13 bounded components ( ) and @xmath10 unbounded components .",
    "these unbounded components come from the intersection of the corresponding curve in @xmath12 with the line at infinity .",
    "harnack constructed a curve in @xmath12 of degree @xmath10 with @xmath11 components which has one component meeting the line at infinity in @xmath10 points .",
    "this harnack curve shows that the bound for non - compact curves in @xmath9 is attained , and choosing a different line at infinity shows that the bound for compact curves in @xmath9 is also attained .",
    "we are interested in the possible number and disposition of the components of the hessian curve in @xmath9 of a polynomial @xmath14 $ ] of degree @xmath15 .",
    "this is problem 2001 - 1 in the list of arnold s problems  @xcite , attributed to a.  ortiz - rodrguez .",
    "see also the discussion of related problems 2000 - 1 , 2000 - 2 , 2001 - 1 , and 2002 - 1 .",
    "the hessian of @xmath5 has degree at most @xmath16 . by harnack s theorem",
    ", a compact hessian curve has at most @xmath17 ovals and a non - compact hessian curve has at most @xmath18 ovals and @xmath19 unbounded components .",
    "while we know of no additional restrictions on hessian curves , we are not assured that all possible configurations are acheived by hessians .",
    "when @xmath15 is at least 4 , simple parameter counting shows that not all polynomials of degree @xmath19 arise as hessians of polynomials of degree @xmath15 .",
    "the placement of the set of hessian curves among all curves of degree @xmath19 may restrict the possible configurations of hessian curves in @xmath9 .",
    "for example , a simple calculation shows that @xmath20 thus the hessian of a polynomial is a linear combination of 3 squares , which shows that the hessians lie in the second secant variety to the veronese embedding of polynomials of degree @xmath21 in polynomials of degree @xmath22 ( the veronese consists of the perfect squares ) .",
    "we also know of no general techniques for constructing hessian curves with a prescribed configuration .",
    "one of us ( ortiz - rodrguez ) investigated this question  @xcite and constructed polynomials @xmath23 $ ] of degree @xmath15 whose hessians had @xmath24 ovals in @xmath9 . when @xmath15 is 4 , 5 , and 6 , these numbers are 3 , 6 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "we do not know if it is possible for a hessian curve to achieve the harnack bound , or more generally , which configurations are possible for hessian curves .    here , we present a quartic polynomial @xmath5 whose hessian achieves the harnack bound of 4 ovals , a quintic whose hessian has 8 ovals , a sextic whose hessian has 11 ovals , as well as examples of non - compact hessian curves of quartics , quintics , and sextics .",
    "these examples show that hessian curves can have more ovals than was previously known .",
    "they were found in a computer search , using the software maple .    our method was to generate a random polynomial ,",
    "compute its hessian , and then compute an upper bound on its number of ovals in @xmath12 , sometimes also screening for the number of unbounded components in @xmath9 .",
    "this upper bound was one - half the minimum number of real critical points of a projection to one of the axes , as each oval in @xmath12 contributes at least two critical points to the projection .",
    "we separately investigated compact hessian curves of sextics .",
    "polynomials whose upper bound for ovals was at least 4 , 8 , and 11 ( for quartics , quintics , and sextics , respectively ) were saved for further study .",
    "the further investigation largely involved viewing pictures in @xmath9 of these potentially interesting hessians . in all , only a few hundred polynomials warranted such further scrutiny .",
    "we examined the hessians of 150 million quartics , 40 million each of quintics and sextics , and over 200 million sextics with compact hessians ( the different protocol of pre - screening for compactness allowed a greater number to be examined ) .",
    "this required 628 days of cpu time on several computers , most of which were running linux on intel pentium processors with speeds between 1.8 and 3 gigahertz .",
    "we did not find a quartic whose hessian had 3 ovals and 4 unbounded components , nor a quintic whose hessian had more than 8 ovals in @xmath12 , nor a sextic whose hessian had more than 11 ovals in @xmath12 .",
    "( the examples we give at the end with 12 ovals in @xmath12 are pertubations of a curve we found with 11 ovals . )",
    "this suggests that it may not be possible for hessian curves in @xmath9 to achieve the harnack bounds .",
    "further pictures and computer code are at the web page",
    ". tables  [ t1 ] and  [ t2 ] summarize this discussion concerning the number of components of hessian curves .",
    "the pairs @xmath25 in table  [ t2 ] refer to ovals and unbounded components , respectively .",
    "each oval has exactly two vertical and two horizontal tangents , and each unbounded component has exactly one vertical and one horizontal tangent .",
    "these claims are best verified symbolically . for each , we give the polynomial @xmath5 and display a picture of the hessian curve , drawn with the implicitplot function of maple .",
    "these were rendered , at least locally , with a grid size sufficiently small to separate the tangents , and therefore provide a faithful picture of the hessian curves as curves in @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ f : two](a ) displays the hessian curve of the quartic @xmath26 which has 3 ovals and 2 unbounded components .",
    "figure  [ f : two](b ) displays the hessian curve of the quartic @xmath27 which has 2 ovals and 4 unbounded components .",
    "despite examining over 240 million sextics , we did not find any sextics whose hessian curves had more than 11 ovals in @xmath12 .",
    "these last two examples , which have 12 ovals in @xmath12 , are perturbations of a sextic found in the search whose hessian curve had 11 ovals in @xmath12 ."
