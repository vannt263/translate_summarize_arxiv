    "for example , according to @xcite , when @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath31 with bounded derivatives of all orders and @xmath32 is @xmath31 with polynomial growth together with its derivatives , then for each integer @xmath33 , the expansion @xmath34-\\mathbb{e } \\bigl[f ( \\bar{x}_t ) \\bigr]=\\sum_{l=1}^l \\frac { a_l}{n^l}+{\\mathcal o } \\bigl(n^{-(l+1 ) } \\bigr)\\label{deverrfaib}\\ ] ] in powers of @xmath30 holds for the weak error .",

    "a simpler scheme with the same convergence properties is exhibited in @xcite for usual stochastic volatility models .",
    "the weak and strong error estimations recalled above imply that @xmath62 a very nice feature of the wasserstein distance is its primal representation in the kantorovitch duality theory .",
