    "quantum heterostructures containing layers of diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) , usually a @xmath6 @xmath5 or @xmath7 based transition metal , have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "the main focus has been made on both fundamental and practical applications , especially these designed for different spin - electronic devices .",
    "presence of transition element ions provides the conditions for magnetic tuning of the heterojunction band alignment due to extraordinarily large spin - splitting of the dms bands due to the exchange interaction between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 band electrons and @xmath10 electrons associated with the @xmath6 element ions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 , @xmath11 exchange interaction between the local moments and the band electrons gives rise to a rich spectrum of collective magnetic behavior .",
    "when an external magnetic field is applied to dms , they exhibit two distinct band gaps , one for each spin direction @xcite .",
    "this splitting of conduction and valence bands ( giant zeeman splitting ) can lead to a sizable spin polarization of the carriers in the dms .",
    "this property is used to inject spin - polarized carriers into nonmagnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "two typical approaches are usually applied to the fabrication of dms heterostructures : a heterostructure with a dms layer as a quantum well ( qw ) @xcite or a heterostructure with dms layers as quantum barriers @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "both the free carriers and the @xmath6 element ions are located in the same layer of a qw .",
    "this leads to a strong interaction between the free carriers and the localized @xmath6-electrons of ions which intensifies the effects caused by the magnetic field .",
    "however , the presence of magnetic impurities in a quantum well stimulates spin relaxation processes @xcite .",
    "hence , it is preferable to separate the carriers from the magnetic media @xcite . in this case",
    ", the exchange interaction between the free @xmath12 carriers of nonmagnetic quantum well and the ions of magnetic impurities in the barrier is driven by penetration of the carrier wave function tails into the barrier .",
    "the effective depth of a well , represented by the difference between the positions of the band edges in adjacent layers , is strongly dependent on the magnetic field . at the same time",
    ", the energy of quantization levels in a shallow well strongly depends on the well depth .",
    "therefore , the electron states in a nonmagnetic quantum well acquire some characteristics of the dms materials , specifically sensitivity to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it seems interesting to investigate the effect of magnetic field on the electron states in a nonmagnetic quantum well effected by a semimagnetic barrier .",
    "the barrier changes its height and exchange interaction with the states .",
    "separation of the two effects can provide an additional degree of freedom in fabricating spintronics devices .",
    "in particular , an additional nonmagnetic layer introduced between a semimagnetic barrier and a nonmagnetic quantum well may be used for this purpose .",
    "since , in the range of our experimental conditions , the nonmagnetic barrier height only negligibly depends on a magnetic field , the changes of an exchange interaction contribution will dominate in the field behavior of the energy characteristics of the qw . in this paper",
    "we show such a possibility using the example of quantum structures based on the @xmath3 quantum well with the @xmath0 and @xmath2 barriers .",
    "the barrier compositions were selected based on the condition of an approximate parity of the band gap of the barriers at zero magnetic field . in order to study the field - induced exchange effects through the intermediate nonmagnetic barrier between @xmath5 ions and free carriers in @xmath3 quantum",
    "well , @xmath2 barrier of different thickness was introduced between the @xmath3 and @xmath0 layers .",

    "the laser energy is tuned to @xmath19 = 2.94 ev exceeding the band gap of the @xmath0 barrier .",
    "[ 2 ] shows the pl spectra for the structures under study without the application of magnetic field .",
    "one can see that the shape of pl spectrum critically depends on the presence of an intermediate @xmath2 barrier between the @xmath3 qw and the semimagnetic @xmath0 layer .",
    "this concerns the two `` evident '' spectra characteristics , i. e. , the number of the pl bands and their intensity .",
    "the most striking feature of this dependence is a decrease of the number of pl bands by one for the structures with an intermediate barrier .",

    "it is necessary to separate the spectra into elementary components .",
    "this turns out to be very complicated problem , especially in the range of high magnetic fields where different pl bands superimpose one above another . as a result",
    ", the experimental pl spectrum can be reproduced in different ways by the same number of elementary bands . as an example , the data in fig .  [ 4 ] illustrate this .        in view of the mentioned ambiguity , decomposition of the experimental spectra into elementary constituents",
    "was carried out using the method of averaging .",
    "details of the method of decomposition will be discussed more in detail elsewhere . here",
    "we emphasize that it is well known @xcite that for the zinc - blende structure , the transition matrix element of the transitions involving heavy holes ( hh ) is three times larger than that involving light holes ( lh ) .",
    "therefore , only those decompositions were taken into account where the pl intensity of the heavy excitons was larger than the pl intensity of the light excitons .",
    "it will be shown below that exactly these excitons form the longest wave pl bands of the structures under study .",
    "not less than 20 different decompositions covering the maximum range of parameter variations for each spectrum were used to determine the averaged values of the parameters .",
    "an analysis showed that the deviation of experimental values of the parameters of different decompositions from their averaged values in any structures do not exceed : ( i ) @xmath23  0.0005  ev for the energy of a short wave component of the spectra and @xmath23  0.0015  ev for the long wave components ; ( ii ) @xmath23  20  % of the averaged value for the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the bands ; @xmath23  60  % of the averaged value for the intensity of the bands .",

    "[ 8 ] ) .",
    "application of a magnetic field increases the intensity of the short wave @xmath25 pl band in any structures . at the same time , the field effect on the behavior of the other pl bands is not that simple .",

    "an intensity of the @xmath58 band increases under transition from low to high magnetic fields in the @xmath15 structure but decreases and comes off plateau in the @xmath18 structure ( fig .",

    "therefore , the analysis that follows the origin of the @xmath24 , @xmath28 , and @xmath40 bands is the same as in the other three structures .    in order to separate the contribution of the barrier height and exchange interaction in the field behavior of different pl bands ,",
    "a quantitative analysis is needed .",
    "the @xmath24 band shift in a magnetic field is caused by the giant zeeman splitting and may be written as @xcite :    @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the effective @xmath5 concentration , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the exchange integrals between the @xmath5 ions and carriers for upper and lower states responsible for this pl band , respectively , @xmath83 is the thermal average of the @xmath5 spin given by :    @xmath84\\label{eq3 } % ( 3)\\ ] ]    @xmath85 is brillouin function of the argument in square brackets , @xmath86 is the bohr magneton , @xmath87 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath88 is the temperature , and @xmath89 is an empirical parameter representing antiferomagnetic interaction between the @xmath5 ions . in our calculations ,",

    "it clearly shows that there are two ranges of magnetic fields for any structure where the rates of the @xmath25 band shift ( @xmath91 ) in the @xmath0 layer are different : they are smaller for low and larger for high magnetic fields .",

    "the parameter @xmath94 is also different for the ranges of low and high magnetic fields .",
    "we marked them @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ 12 ] that many of the parameters of the @xmath24 band in the @xmath0 layer are different not only for low and high magnetic fields .",
    "they are also different for the structures with and without the intermediate @xmath2 barrier as well as for the structures of different barrier thickness .",
    "let us examine these parameters .",
    "@xmath96 has a sense of a band gap of the semimagnetic @xmath0 barrier in zero magnetic fields .",
    "this parameter increases monotonously from 2.8932  ev for the barrier in the @xmath15 structure to 2.9019  ev for the same barrier in the @xmath18 structure ( fig .",
    "we explain the observed changes of the parameters @xmath96 as well as of the energy of @xmath24 bands by both : ( i ) the effect of the strains of the @xmath0 barrier surface layers caused by the action of the adjacent @xmath3 or @xmath2 layers on the band gap value ; ( ii ) the dominant contribution of the strained surface layers in forming the emission bands of the semimagnetic barrier .",
    "it is well known that in the absence of strain , the maxima of the heavy- and light - hole valence bands are degenerate in the zinc - blende semiconductors .",
    "the biaxial strain shifts and splits the heavy- and light - hole bands .",
    "if the strain is compressive , the band gap increases and coincides with the heavy - hole - derived band gap . in the case of biaxial tension , the band gap shrinks and",
    "is associated with the light - hole transition @xcite .",
    "the layers of the structures under study have different lattice constants : @xmath66(@xmath3 )  =  5.6684   , @xmath66(@xmath2 )  =  5.6382   , @xmath66(@xmath0 )  =  5.6592  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they deform each other : @xmath3 tenses the surface layers of @xmath0 , and @xmath2 compresses them .",

    "[ 13 ] shows that the band gap of the @xmath0 strain layers asymptotically approaches the value 2.9043  ev under compression by the @xmath2 layer when @xmath97 approaches 30  nm .",
    "extrapolation of the data in fig .",
    "[ 13 ] also shows that the band gap of the strainless @xmath0 is equal to 2.894  ev .",
    "thus , the biaxial strain of the @xmath0 layer by the @xmath2 layer can increase the band gap of the former by approximately 10  mev .",
    "the obtained dependences of @xmath98 from @xmath4 may be explained by the dependence of the band gap of @xmath0 on the strains if the strained contact layers provide the main contribution to the emission transitions .",
    "note that the importance of the strained heterointerface for localization of excitons was already emphasized in initial investigations of the ii - vi strained - layer heterostructures@xcite .",

    ", the @xmath101 value is the same only for the structures with the intermediate @xmath2 barrier .",
    "for the @xmath15 structure without any intermediate barrier it is larger by approximately 22  % .",
    "it means that the exchange integral for electronic states of the @xmath5 complex in the structures under study develops appreciably with participation of the @xmath12 free carriers of the @xmath3 qw . in accordance with our previous analysis @xcite the band exchange integrals for the @xmath0 layer are equal to @xmath81  =  0.104  ev , @xmath103  =  -  0.264  ev . the value of the exchange integral for electronic states of the @xmath5 complex in the @xmath15 structure is equal to 0.156 ev . using the obtained @xmath101 value for the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 structures we see that the application of intermediate @xmath2 barrier decreases this value to 0.112 ev , i.e. , by approximately 40  % .",
    "we explain these results in the following way .",
    "there are two types of free carriers contributing to the exchange interaction in the strained surface layers of the @xmath0 barrier : @xmath106 carriers of the @xmath0 barrier and @xmath12 carriers of the @xmath3 qw .",
    "the wave functions of @xmath106 carriers are quite extended and span a large number of lattice sites of the @xmath0 barrier . on the contrary , only the tails of the wave functions of @xmath12 carriers penetrate from qw into the barrier .",
    "this penetration decreases or is absent when the intermediate @xmath2 barrier appears between the @xmath3 and @xmath0 layers .",
    "thus , we can unambiguously conclude that @xmath12 carriers of the @xmath3 qw give negligible contribution to the formation of exchange integrals for @xmath104 and @xmath105 bands of the @xmath0 strained contact layers but their contribution to the exchange interaction between the @xmath5 complexes in these layers is can be described by mixing of the @xmath10 levels of manganese with the states of 2@xmath107 free carriers of the @xmath3 qw .",
    "this is possible only if the @xmath5 complex concentration in the strained layers is larger than the concentration of @xmath5 in the sites of crystal lattice .",
    "in other words , most probably the @xmath5 complexes in @xmath0 develop into the strained layers of a heterocontact .",
    "let us now consider the long wave @xmath40 pl band . the layer of the @xmath3 qw experiences compression on the part of both @xmath0 and @xmath2 layers . as a result ,",
    "its heavy- and light - hole bands split and the heavy - hole band defines the band gap in any structures under study .",
    "therefore , the heavy excitons @xmath108 form the long wave component @xmath109 of @xmath21 and @xmath22-polarization , respectively , and the light excitons @xmath110 form the short wave component @xmath111 of the @xmath40 band .    a splitting between the energy of heavy and light excitons in zero magnetic fields is equal to ( 2.0  @xmath23  0.3 )  mev for all structures . at the same time , the energies of both heavy and light excitons are different for different structures and increase with an increased thickness of the intermediate nonmagnetic barrier @xmath2 between the @xmath0 and @xmath3 layers .",
    "the dependences of @xmath112(@xmath111 ) and @xmath112(@xmath113 ) on the thickness of the intermediate barrier in case of the absence of magnetic field are shown in fig .",
    "[ 14 ] .     and @xmath109 bands vs. the intermediate @xmath2 barrier thickness in zero magnetic fields and their approximations.,width=264 ]",
    "one can see that both @xmath112(@xmath111 ) and @xmath112(@xmath113 ) increase if @xmath1(@xmath2 ) increases and asymptotically approach the energy 2.861 and 2.859 ev , respectively .",
    "the cause of these changes is the same as in the case of the @xmath24 bands : the deformation effects .",
    "there is the following ratio between the lattice constants of the layers of the structures : @xmath114 @xmath27 @xmath115 @xmath27 @xmath116 . as a result , the @xmath2 layer more strongly compresses the @xmath3 qw layer than the @xmath0 layer and its deformation effect increases if @xmath1(@xmath2 ) increases .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 layer band gap increases and the exciton energy increases too .",
    "for the @xmath15 structure in zero magnetic fields @xmath112(@xmath111 ) =  2.8478 ,  and @xmath112(@xmath113 ) =  2.8455",
    "it is seen that under the effect of the intermediate barrier , the heavy - hole - derived band gap of the @xmath3 qw increases by 13 mev extra .",
    "application of a magnetic field splits the band edges in the well .",
    "however , the zeeman splitting for nonmagnetic @xmath3 should be negligible taking into account the g - factor value for electrons and holes@xcite . actually @xmath112(@xmath111 ) and @xmath112(@xmath113 )",
    "negligibly depends on @xmath4 only for the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 structures and only in magnetic fields @xmath4 @xmath31 ( 2.0 @xmath117 2.5 )  t ( fig .  [ 5 ] ) . for higher magnetic fields ,",
    "the energy of @xmath40 exciton bands appreciably decreases .",
    "there are more essential changes in the energy positions of both @xmath111 and @xmath109 bands in a magnetic field for the @xmath15 structure , as we have emphasized above .",
    "it is obvious that the exchange interaction between free carriers of the qw and @xmath5 ions of the semimagnetic barrier , which is further modified by the intermediate nonmagnetic barrier , causes the observed changes .",
    "the @xmath15 structure is the structure with a shallow nonmagnetic qw having the adjacent layer of semimagnetic semiconductor .",
    "therefore , the effective depth of the well , given by the difference between the positions of the band edges in the adjacent layers , is strongly dependent on the magnetic field , and in a shallow well the energy of the size quantization levels is strongly dependent on the well depth . for the other structures , the situation is radically different .",
    "herein the positions of the band edges of the @xmath2 layers adjacent to the qw negligibly depend on @xmath4 and the height of the intermediate barrier also negligibly depends on @xmath4 . at the same time",
    ", an effective barrier height for electrons and holes appreciably depends on @xmath4 because the position of the band edges of the @xmath0 layer depends on @xmath4 .",
    "it changes a range of penetration of the wave functions of the @xmath3",
    "qw well free carriers in the barrier ( @xmath0 + @xmath2 ) because the boundary conditions on the qw edge ( @xmath2  / @xmath3 ) change . however",
    ", a change of the height of the intermediate and effective barriers has got a different effect on the shift of both @xmath111 and @xmath109 bands .",
    "as soon as an intermediate barrier height changes , the @xmath40 band position also changes . in case of an effective barrier",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "as it follows from the obtained data , the @xmath118 edge should go down appreciably lower than the @xmath119 edge before the @xmath40 bands change their position . in accordance with the energy diagram of the @xmath15 structure @xcite , the offset between the @xmath104 and @xmath105 bands of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 @xmath3 layers distributed as @xmath120e@xmath121/@xmath120e@xmath122  =  60/40 which is typical of these materials @xcite .",
    "the intermediate barrier somewhat decreases the value @xmath123 , which determines the mutual location of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 @xmath3 layer band edges on the energy scale .",
    "its magnitude for the @xmath15 structure is equal to 47.7  mev , and the averaged magnitude for the other three structures is equal to ( 42.3  @xmath23  1.5 ) mev .",
    "if we share this value in proportion @xmath124  we find that @xmath77-@xmath76 in zero magnetic field for the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 structures is equal to 16.9 mev .",
    "the energy of @xmath111 and @xmath109 bands start to decrease only if the @xmath125 goes down to approximately 24.5  mev ( @xmath1262  t ) .",
    "however , one needs to remember that the effective barrier for both electrons and holes forming the @xmath47 bands goes down when @xmath4 increases . on the contrary",
    ", the effective barrier for electrons and holes forming the @xmath127 bands goes up . at the same time , the energy of @xmath111 and @xmath109 pair decreases in the range of high magnetic fields .",
    "it entirely bears a resemblance to the behavior of both @xmath111 and @xmath109 bands in the @xmath15 structure in this magnetic range . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we explained such a behavior of different polarized exciton bands in the qw by the influence of the spin - flip processes caused by the degeneration of energy levels of the @xmath3 qw and the @xmath0 layer .",
    "we believe that the same processes also occur in the structures with the intermediate nonmagnetic barrier but",
    "the barrier presence somewhat changes the situation .",
    "the barrier weakens the interaction between the @xmath3 qw and the @xmath0 layer . as a result",
    ", the spin - flip processes also weaken and the differently polarized @xmath40 bands gradually drift apart . the data in fig .",
    "[ 15 ] clearly show this .",
    "( @xmath66 ) and @xmath18 structures ( @xmath63 ) of @xmath21 ( black lines ) and @xmath22-polarization ( red lines ) for @xmath4 =  5.25  t in the energy range of the @xmath40 bands .",
    "right - the shift between the energy positions of @xmath47 and @xmath127 bands vs. @xmath1(@xmath2 ) at 5.25  t.,width=264 ]    let us examine the @xmath28 band .",
    "it is formed by the emission transition inside the semimagnetic layer @xmath0 but the presence of the intermediate barrier in the structure and its thickness appreciably changes this band behavior .",
    "first of all , this barrier changes the energy positions of the donor @xmath73 and acceptor @xmath74 levels in the @xmath0 surface strain layers in zero magnetic field , which form the @xmath28 band .",
    "a sum of @xmath73 and @xmath74 may be determined as the difference between @xmath96 and @xmath128 .",
    "this difference is equal to 31  mev for the @xmath15 structure and is larger by approximately 3 mev for the other three structures .",
    "[ 5 ] data make it possible to divide a contribution of both @xmath73 and @xmath74 shifts under conversion from the tensed to compressed contact layers of @xmath0 in formation of the mentioned difference . in the @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath17 , and @xmath18 structures , both @xmath32 and @xmath129 bands intersect in a magnetic field approximately over 1.9  t. in accordance with the rate of both @xmath130 and @xmath125 level shift , it corresponds to @xmath73  @xmath69  10 mev and @xmath74  @xmath69  24 mev .",
    "if we compare these values with the same ones for the @xmath15 structure @xcite , we see that @xmath73 decreases approximately by 5.5 mev and @xmath74 increases approximately by 8.5 mev under conversion from a tension deformation to a compression deformation of the @xmath0 layers .",
    "we explain this in the following way . under deformation",
    ", both spectrum and wave functions of the electrons for the degenerate band are determined by the solution of the wave equation with hamiltonian having an addition , which determines of the band splitting .",
    "this splitting leads to a reconstruction of the impurity spectrum especially if the splitting of the degenerated band grows up to the energy of impurity ionization @xmath112@xmath131 @xcite . in our case",
    ", it corresponds to an acceptor center case .",
    "the case for a donor center is different .",
    "a conduction band of @xmath0 is non - degenerate . for a non - degenerate band , the change of energy of an impurity center @xmath120@xmath112@xmath131/@xmath112@xmath131",
    "is only related to the change of the free carrier effective mass and is approximately @xmath120@xmath132/@xmath132 @xcite . for estimation",
    ", @xmath112i may be equated to the average value of @xmath73 for the structures with and without the intermediate barrier while @xmath120@xmath112@xmath131 may be equated to the deviation from this average value .",
    "then , we conclude that the deformations originated by the lattice mismatches can cause the change of the free electron effective mass@xcite by about 20  % in the structures under study",
    ".    another important feature of the @xmath28 band is its comparative shift relatively to the @xmath133 band if a magnetic field is applied .",
    "the @xmath51 band does not change its energy position either before or after intersecting with the @xmath25 band position .",
    "this means that the spin - up states of impurity electrons do not mix with the spin - down band electron states and form the resonance state in both @xmath104 and @xmath105 bands of @xmath0 in high magnetic fields .",
    "the spin - down states of impurity electrons mix with the spin - down band electron states in high magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the energy of the @xmath32 band decreases if the @xmath74 level intersects the @xmath125 edge ( the @xmath15 structure , fig .  [ 5 ] ) or the band disappears if both @xmath74 and @xmath73 levels intersect @xmath125 and @xmath130 edges , respectively ( both @xmath16 and @xmath17 structure , fig  [ 5 ] ) . it is not entirely clear why the resonance spin - down states of impurity electrons appear in the @xmath104 and @xmath105 band of strained @xmath0 layers in the @xmath18 structure with the thickest intermediate barrier in high magnetic field as well as why the spin - up states of impurity electrons disappear in both @xmath15 and @xmath16 structures in relatively low magnetic fields .",
    "let us now examine some aspects of the pl intensity related to the presence of the @xmath2 intermediate barrier in the structures under study and its effect on the transfer of magnetic interaction between the semimagnetic @xmath0 layer and nonmagnetic @xmath3 qw .",
    "the first one is the barrier effect on the intensity of the @xmath12 excitons of the @xmath3 qw in zero magnetic fields .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ 8 ] , this intensity increases if the intermediate barrier is applied and @xmath1(@xmath2 ) increases .",
    "we explain this in the following way . applying the intermediate barrier we equalize the strain on the both sides of the qw .",
    "the strain equalization becomes more effective when the intermediate barrier thickness increases .",
    "a decrease of the structure inhomogeneity naturally leads to an increase of emitting recombination .",
    "the second aspect is the barrier effect on the field dependence of the intensity of @xmath40 bands in low magnetic fields .",
    "giant zeeman splitting of the band edges of the @xmath0 layer is an immediate cause of this effect . applying a magnetic field we decrease both @xmath130 and @xmath125 edges of the @xmath104 and @xmath105 bands of the @xmath0 layer . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath2 barrier confines the thermalized carriers in this layer and counteracts their transfer into the @xmath3 qw layer .",
    "the larger is magnetic field , the stronger is the carrier confinement in the @xmath0 layer . since the pl intensity is lower if a concentration of the recombining electrons and holes is smaller , both @xmath56(@xmath41 ) and @xmath56(@xmath45 ) decrease if @xmath4 increases .",
    "a recombining carrier concentration is not only a factor defined pl intensity .",
    "it especially depends on the emission probability , which , for its part , is proportional to a density of states of the free carriers @xcite .",
    "a magnetic field applied transversely to the structure layers transforms the free @xmath12 carriers in the @xmath3 qw to 0@xmath134carrier if @xmath4 increases to the quantum strong limit . in this field range a density of states of the carrier is defined by @xmath4 and increases if @xmath4 increases .",
    "therefore , the intensity of @xmath47 bands has to change a decrease for an increase if a magnetic field passes in the range of quantum magnetic fields .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ 9 ] ( right ) , @xmath56(@xmath47 ) starts increasing at @xmath135  0.75  t. using @xmath132@xmath136  =  0.6  @xmath132@xmath137 @xcite , for this @xmath4 value we obtain a hole cyclotron energy @xmath138  @xmath69  0.14  mev .",
    "the thermal energy of the experiment is @xmath139@xmath137 t  @xmath69  0.1  mev .",
    "therefore , for @xmath4  @xmath27  0.75  t , the condition of quantum magnetic fields is already in progress . as a result",
    ", two factors determine the further behavior of @xmath56(@xmath47 ) in a magnetic field : a confinement of the free carrier in the @xmath0 layer by the @xmath2 barrier and an increase of the state density of the 0@xmath107 carriers in the @xmath3 qw if @xmath4 increases .",
    "the latter factor dominates and @xmath56(@xmath47 ) increases .",
    "in this paper we have reported the measurements of luminescence of the 150  nm @xmath0  / @xmath1  nm  @xmath2  / 2.5  nm  @xmath3  / 30  nm  @xmath2 structures as a function of thickness @xmath1 of the intermediate nonmagnetic barrier @xmath2 between the @xmath0 semimagnetic barrier and @xmath3 qw and magnetic field at the low temperature 1.2  k. strong evidence has been obtained that the intermediate nonmagnetic barrier : ( i ) changes the energy of the pl bands in both the @xmath3 qw and @xmath0 semimagnetic barrier layers ; ( ii ) increases the total pl intensity of the structures ; ( iii ) decreases the degree of circular polarization of the qw exciton emission in the structure ; ( iv ) extinguishes the pl band caused by the indirect transitions in real space between the @xmath12 conduction band of the @xmath3 qw and both the @xmath5 complex and the valence band of the @xmath0  layer .",
    "the obtained data enable us to conclude that the emission bands appearing in the semimagnetic @xmath0  barrier of the structures under study are formed in the contact layers strained by the intermediate @xmath2  or @xmath3 layers .",
    "the shifts of the band gap as well as of the donor and acceptor levels under the effect of biaxial compression of the @xmath0 layer by the @xmath2 layer are estimated .",
    "it is revealed that there are two different rates ( @xmath91)@xmath93 and ( @xmath91)@xmath92 of the shift of the short wave bands of the pl spectra of the structure under study in a magnetic field caused by giant zeeman splitting",
    ". the larger rate ( @xmath91)@xmath93 is observed in the high magnetic fields and corresponds to the emission transition between @xmath104 and @xmath105 bands of the @xmath0  barrier",
    ". a smaller rate ( @xmath91)@xmath92 is observed in low magnetic fields and corresponds to the emission transition between the @xmath0  conduction band and an energy level of the acceptor complex containing @xmath5 .",
    "the intermediate nonmagnetic barrier @xmath2 does not change the ( @xmath91)@xmath140value and accordingly its constituents @xmath81 and @xmath103 values , which are equal to @xmath141  =  0.104  ev and  @xmath142  =  -0.264  ev . at the same time , it decreases the ( @xmath91)@xmath92 value by approximately 22  % which we interpret as a decrease of the exchange integral for electronic states of the @xmath5 complex in the @xmath0  barrier by approximately 40  % ( from 0.156 to 0.112 ev ) under the effect of the intermediate @xmath2 barrier .",
    "this supports the assumption that : ( i ) the deformation of the @xmath0  layers plays a key role in forming the @xmath5 complexes ; ( ii ) the @xmath12 carriers of the @xmath3 qw provide a substantial contribution to the formation of the exchange integral for the @xmath5 complexes in strained layers .",
    "the @xmath2 intermediate barrier changes the effect of giant zeeman splitting of the semimagnetic @xmath0 barrier energy levels on a move of the energy levels of @xmath3 qw in a magnetic field and a polarization of the qw exciton emission .",
