    "the nuclei close to the particle drip lines are very weakly bound and can have exotic properties according to our knowledge of stable nuclei , which makes them fascinating quantum systems exhibiting the threshold effects , such as halo states  @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous theoretical studies on the halos of weakly bound nuclei , but most of them are spherical  @xcite . in particular , for weakly - bound deformed nuclei , exotic deformed halos with decoupled surface deformations from the cores are predicted  @xcite .",
    "it was known that the continuum degree of freedom plays an important role in weakly - bound nuclei  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the theoretical descriptions of weakly - bound deformed nuclei should precisely take into account the continuum effect , deformations and large spatial extensions . in this context ,",
    "the self - consistent hfb approach of density functional theory with continuum couplings is a suitable method .",
    "however , the exact treatment of continuum states in the hfb approach for deformed nuclei is rare and much more complicated compared to the spherical case  @xcite .    in the hfb approach",
    ", the continuum can be treated either by the discretization method or by exact solutions with scattering boundary conditions  @xcite . in the discretization method",
    ", the continuum can be discretized on a discrete set of basis functions  @xcite or on the coordinate - space lattice  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the hfb solvers are based on the ho basis which are very efficient but not suitable for describing weakly - bound systems .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the coordinate - space hfb approach is very precise for describing weakly - bound nuclei and continuum effects  @xcite . for halo structures with large spatial extensions ,",
    "the coordinate - space hfb descriptions definitely need large box sizes .",
    "in addition , it was known that the resulted number of continuum states increases significantly ( @xmath0 ) as the box size @xmath1 increases  @xcite .",
    "the very dense quasiparticle energy spectrum can provide good resolutions for the resonance and non - resonant continuum",
    ". therefore it will be very useful to study the weakly - bound deformed nuclei by the hfb approach in large boxes .",
    "however , the computational cost will be increased tremendously as the box sizes is increased in deformed cases .",
    "fortunately , due to the development of supercomputing capabilities , the deformed hfb descriptions in large box can be realized through large - scale parallel calculations  @xcite .    in deformed weakly - bound nuclei , the subtle interplay among surface deformations , surface diffuseness , and continuum coupling can result in exotic structures , and the theoretical studies need precise hfb solutions .",
    "for example , there was an argument about the existence of two - neutron deformed halos based on the three - body model  @xcite .",
    "while the existence of one - neutron deformed halos has been confirmed experimentally  @xcite , in our previous work  @xcite , we have shown that large - box hfb calculations give an exotic  egg \"- like halo structure in @xmath2ne showing the core - halo deformation decoupling , which is associated with the phase space decoupling in the quasiparticle energy spectra .",
    "it was demonstrated that the near - threshold non - resonant continuum is mainly responsible for such an exotic halo structure  @xcite .",
    "thus the quasiparticle spectrum provides an important test for the precision of hfb solutions .",
    "some earlier studies showed that calculations with small box sizes may not be sufficient to describe the pairing properties  @xcite and quasiparticle spectrum of pairing occupation numbers  @xcite . besides",
    ", one may be cautious about the continuum discretization method for descriptions of broad quasiparticle resonances as the reaction model cdcc has been suffering  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to evaluate the influences of the precision of hfb solutions in the prediction of drip lines .",
    "indeed , the usually adopted accuracy benchmark of hfb calculations by comparing total binding energies may not be sufficient for descriptions of weakly - bound nuclei in details .",
    "our motivation in this paper is to further examine the hfb calculations of weakly bound deformed nuclei and study the box size dependence in several aspects , including energetic properties , deformations , densities and pairing densities , and the near - threshold quasiparticle spectra of resonances and continuum , with much larger box sizes compared to our previous work .",
    "this will be useful for further studies of novel structures and excitation modes in weakly - bound deformed nuclei so that one is sure that they do not arise from uncontrolled approximations .",
    "in this work , the skyrme - hfb equation is solved by the hfb - ax code  @xcite within a 2d lattice box , based on b - spline techniques for axially symmetric deformed nuclei  @xcite . to obtain sufficient accuracy ,",

    "because the computing cost is extremely high , the hybrid mpi+openmp parallel programming is implemented to get converged results within a reasonable time  @xcite .",
