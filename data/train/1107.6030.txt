    "given the precision that has been recently achieved in the measurement of the casimir forces @xcite , the use of realistic models for the description of the media that constitute the mirrors is an unavoidable step for the improvement of casimir energy calculations , which is needed for comparison with the experimental data .",
    "moreover , from a conceptual point of view , the theoretical calculations for mirrors with general electromagnetic properties , including absorption , is not a completely settled issue @xcite .",
    "since dissipative effects imply the possibility of energy interchanges between different parts of the full system ( mirrors , vacuum field and environment ) , the theory of quantum open systems @xcite is the natural approach to clarify the role of dissipation in casimir physics .",
    "indeed , in this framework , dissipation and noise appears in the effective theory of the relevant degrees of freedom ( the electromagnetic field ) after integration of the matter and other environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "dielectric slabs are in general nonlinear , inhomogeneous , dispersive and also dissipative media .",
    "these aspects turn difficult the quantization of a field when all of them have to be taken into account simultaneously .",
    "there are different approaches to address this problem . on the one hand",
    ", one can use a phenomenological description based on the macroscopic electromagnetic properties of the materials .",
    "the quantization can be performed starting from the macroscopic maxwell equations , and including noise terms to account for absorption @xcite . in this approach",
    "a canonical quantization scheme is not possible , unless one couples the electromagnetic field to a reservoir ( see @xcite ) , following the standard route to include dissipation in simple quantum mechanical systems .",
    "another possibility is to establish a first - principles model in which the slabs are described through their microscopic degrees of freedom , which are coupled to the electromagnetic field . in this kind of models ,",
    "losses are also incorporated by considering a thermal bath , to allow for the possibility of absorption of light .",
    "there is a large body of literature on the quantization of the electromagnetic field in dielectrics .",
    "regarding microscopic models , the fully canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in dispersive and lossy dielectrics has been performed by huttner and barnett ( hb ) @xcite . in the hb model , the electromagnetic field",
    "is coupled to matter ( the polarization field ) , and the matter is coupled to a reservoir that is included into the model to describe the losses . in the context of the theory of quantum open systems , one can think the hb model as a composite system in which the relevant degrees of freedom belong to two subsystems ( the electromagnetic field and the matter ) , and the matter degrees of freedom are in turn coupled to an environment ( the thermal reservoir ) .",
    "the indirect coupling between the electromagnetic field and the thermal reservoir is responsible for the losses . as we will comment below",
    ", this will be our starting point to compute the casimir force between absorbing media .",
    "regarding the casimir force , the celebrated lifshitz formula @xcite describes the forces between dielectrics in terms of their macroscopic electromagnetic properties .",
    "the original derivation of this very general formula is based on a macroscopic approach , starting from stochastic maxwell equations and using thermodynamical properties for the stochastic fields . as pointed out in several papers ,",
    "the connection between this approach and an approach based on a fully quantized model is not completely clear .",
    "moreover , some doubts have been raised about the applicability of the lifshitz formula to lossy dielectrics @xcite .",
    "the first calculation of the casimir force between two absorbing slabs using a microscopic approach is , to our knowledge , due to kupiszewska @xcite , who modeled dielectric atoms as a set of harmonic oscillators coupled to an environment with @xmath1 , in which the atoms can dissipate energy . in that work , a scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions",
    "was considered , and all the environmental effects were described through a dissipative constant and a langevin force . in the context of quantum open systems , this is tantamount to consider an ohmic environment .",
    "the force between slabs was then obtained in terms of the reflection coefficients associated to the slabs , which are described by a complex dielectric function .",
    "this result was rederived using a green - function method for quantizing the macroscopic field in absorbing systems in 1d in conjuction with scattering matrix approach @xcite .",
    "this was also extended to two identical absorbing superlattices @xcite .",
    "esquivel - sirvent et al demonstrated an alternative green - function approach that makes the quantization of the field within the slabs unnecessary and calculate the casimir force in an asymmetric configuration @xcite which was earlier considered only in the lossless case @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the casimir force was calculated in a lossless dispersive layer of an otherwise absorbing multilayer by using the macroscopic field operators considered by @xcite . in the series of works @xcite ,",
    "rosa et al considered the evaluation of the electromagnetic energy density in the presence of an absorbing and dissipative dielectric , using the hb model for @xmath1 and constant dissipation .",
    "in particular , in the recent ref.@xcite , they obtained the force density associated to spatial variations of the permittivity from which , in principle , one could obtain the casimir force between slabs .    in this paper",
    "we will follow a program similar to that of ref.@xcite , generalizing it by considering a general and well defined quantum open system .",
    "we will work with a simplified model analogous to the one of hb , assuming that the dielectric atoms in the slabs are quantum brownian particles , and that they are subjected to fluctuations ( noise ) and dissipation , due to the coupling to an external thermal environment .",
    "we will keep generality in the type of spectral density to specify the bath to which the atoms are coupled , generalizing the constant dissipation model used in ref.@xcite . indeed , after integration of the environmental degrees of freedom , it will be possible to obtain the dissipation and noise kernels that modify the unitary equation of motion of the dielectric atoms . as we will see , general non - ohmic environments do not provide constant dissipation coefficients in the equation of motion of the brownian particles , even at high temperatures . moreover , the spectral density of the environment determines the electromagnetic properties of the mirrors and therefore have a direct influence on the casimir force .",
    "in addition to the conceptual issues described above , there are additional motivations to consider detailed microscopic models of the casimir force , in particular , the controversy about its temperature dependence . assuming simple phenomenological descriptions of the materials based on the plasma or drude models , the theoretical predictions for the casimir force are different due to the contribution ( or not ) of the te zero mode @xcite . at small distances",
    "@xmath2 such that @xmath3 , the differences are not too large , and the experimental results by decca et al @xcite seem to be well described by the plasma model .",
    "however , at large distances @xmath4 , the theoretical predictions differ by a factor @xmath5 . the casimir force at such large distances have been recently measured @xcite , and the results are compatible with the drude model after taking into account the interactions due to patch potentials on the surfaces of the conductors ( some authors disagree with the evaluation of the effects of the patch potentials , see @xcite ) . in any case , these controversies show that more detailed microscopic models are necessary to clarify the situation .",
    "for example , considering that the slabs contain classical or quantum non relativistic charges interacting via the static coulomb potential , the result for the large distance limit agrees with that of the drude model @xcite .",
    "another motivation for considering the casimir forces in the framework of open quantum systems is the possibility of analyzing non equilibrium effects , such as the casimir force between objects at different temperatures @xcite and the power of heat transfer between them @xcite , including the time dependent evolution until reaching a stationary situation .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in next section we shall present the model , the heisenberg equations of motion for the different operators , and the vacuum and langevin contributions to the field operator . in section",
    "iii we study much in deep the relationship between the microscopic model and the macroscopic electromagnetic properties of the mirrors .",
    "section iv is dedicated to the evaluation of the casimir force . after adding the vacuum and langevin contributions ,",
    "we show that the total force is given by a lifshitz - like formula , where the reflection coefficients of the slabs depend on the properties of the atoms and the environment considered in the model . in section",
    "v we comment on the relation of the quantum open systems approach developed in this paper and the euclidean computation of the casimir force .",
    "we summarize our findings in section vi .",
    "the appendices contain some details of the calculations .",
    "with the aim of including effects of dissipation and noise in the calculation of casimir force , we will use the theory of open quantum systems , having in mind the paradigmatic example of the quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a system composed of two parts : a massless scalar field and dielectric slabs which , in turn , are described by their internal degrees of freedom ( a set of harmonic oscillators ) .",
    "both sub - systems conform a composite system which is coupled to a second set of harmonic oscillators , that plays the role of an external environment or thermal bath . for simplicity we will work in @xmath0 dimensions . in our toy model the massless field represents the electromagnetic field , and the first set of harmonic oscillators directly coupled to the scalar field represents the atoms in the slab .    considering the usual interaction term between the electromagnetic field and the ordinary matter , the coupling between the field and the atoms in the slab will be taken as a current - type one , where the field couples to the velocity of the atoms .",
    "the coupling constant for this interaction is the electric charge @xmath6 .",
    "we will also assume that there is no direct coupling between the field and the thermal bath . the lagrangian density is therefore given by :    @xmath7    where we have stressed the fact that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are also functions of the position , i.e. each atom interacts with a thermal bath placed at the same position .",
    "we have denoted by @xmath10 the density of atoms in both slabs .",
    "the constants @xmath11 are the coupling constants between the atoms and the bath oscillators .",
    "it is implicitly understood that eq.([lagrangianatotal ] ) represents the lagrangian density inside the plates , while outside the plates the lagrangian is given by the free field one .",
    "the configuration of the slabs , of thickness @xmath12 and separated by a distance @xmath2 is shown in fig.1 .    .",
    "in this work we consider a 1 + 1 version of this configuration.,width=302 ]    the quantization of the theory is straightforward .",
    "it should be noted that the full hilbert space of the model @xmath13 , where the quantization is performed , is not only the field hilbert space @xmath14 ( as is considered in others works where the field is the only relevant degree of freedom ) , but also includes the hilbert spaces of the atoms @xmath15 and the bath oscillators @xmath16 , in such a way that @xmath17 .",
    "we will assume , as frequently done in the context of qbm , that for @xmath18 the three parts of the systems are uncorrelated and not interacting .",
    "interactions are turned on at @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the initial conditions for the operators @xmath20 , @xmath21 must be given in terms of operators acting in each part of the hilbert space .",
    "the interactions will make that initial operators to become operators over the whole space @xmath13 .",
    "the initial density matrix of the total system is of the form :    @xmath22    since we are interested in the steady state ( @xmath23 ) , we will assume thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath24 between the three parts . each density matrix in eq.([estadoinicial ] ) will be taken as thermal type ( we have set @xmath25 ) .",
    "starting from the lagrangian ( [ lagrangianatotal ] ) , it is easy to derive the heisenberg equations of motion for the different operators .",
    "they are are given by :    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    where the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the conjugate momentum operators associated to the operators @xmath21 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "substituting eq.([ecmovtotala ] ) into eq.([ecmovtotalb ] ) , we get :    @xmath34    as usual in the context of qbm , we solve the equations for the operators @xmath33 taking @xmath21 as a source , and replace the solutions into eq.([ecmovtotald ] ) . in this way ,",
    "the microscopic degrees of freedom in the slabs satisfy a langevin - like equation of the form    @xmath35    where the damping kernel @xmath36 and the stochastic force operator @xmath37 are the same as the ones of qbm ( see @xcite for a general and complete view ) .",
    "they are given by    @xmath38    @xmath39    here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the annihilation and creation operators associated to @xmath33 , and @xmath42 is the spectral density that characterizes the environment .",
    "this function gives the number of oscillators in each frecuency for given values of the coupling constants @xmath11 :    @xmath43    in order to obtain a true irreversible dynamics , we introduce a continuous distribution of bath modes , that replaces the spectral density by a smooth function of the frequency @xmath44 of the bath modes .",
    "different functions will describe different types of environments .",
    "physically , the thermal bath has a finite number of oscillators in a given range of frequencies .",
    "then , a cutoff function must be introduced , containing some characteristic frecuency scale @xmath45 .",
    "then , the spectral density takes the following form    @xmath46    in the equation above , @xmath47 is the relaxation constant of the environment , while @xmath48 is the frequency cutoff function .",
    "the values of @xmath49 classify the different types of environments : @xmath50 corresponds to an ohmic environment ( in which there is a dissipative term proportional to the velocity in the langevin equation for the brownian particle ) , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 describe subohmics and supraohmics environments respectively @xcite .    at equilibrium , the stochastic force operator in eq.([qbmoperadorfdet ] ) and the damping kernel @xmath36 in eq.([qbmnucleoamortiguamiento ] ) are not independent .",
    "the statistical properties of the stochastic force operator are given by the dissipation and noise kernels    @xmath53\\right\\rangle = i\\left[\\widehat{f}(t);\\widehat{f}(t')\\right]=-2\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}d\\omega j(\\omega)\\sin[\\omega ( t - t ' ) ] , \\label{qbmnucleodisipacion}\\ ] ]    @xmath54 , \\label{qbmnucleoruido}\\ ] ]    which are the formal quantum open systems generalization of the relations employed in ref.@xcite for general environments and arbitrary temperature .",
    "note that only the noise kernel @xmath55 involves the environmental temperature @xmath56 as a parameter .",
    "considering eq.([qbmnucleoamortiguamiento ] ) and eq.([qbmnucleodisipacion ] ) , it is easy to show that :    @xmath57    which relates the damping kernel @xmath36 to the statistical properties of the stochastic force operator @xmath37 .",
    "all in all , the set of equations to solve now are eqs.([ecmovtotalc ] ) , ( [ ecmovtotale ] ) , and ( [ ecmovryp ] ) .",
    "it is possible to obtain a formal solution for the operators @xmath58 by considering the field @xmath59 as a source for the equation .",
    "this solution generalizes the crude approximation made in ref .",
    "@xcite for the evolution of the microscopic degrees of freedom in the mirrors .",
    "it is given by :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 are the green functions associated to the qbm equation that satisfy :    @xmath62    @xmath63    for which , the laplace transforms are given by    @xmath64    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the laplace transform of the damping kernel .",
    "note that , given these conditions , one can prove that @xmath67 .    inserting this solution into eq.([ecmovtotale ] ) , we obtain the following equation for the field operator    @xmath68    subjected to the free field initial conditions :    @xmath69    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the annihilation and creation operators for the free field , and @xmath73 .",
    "the boundary conditions are the continuity of the field and its spatial derivative at the interface points .",
    "we will compute the casimir force from the @xmath74-component of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath75 the force is explicitly given by @xmath76 where the expectation values are taken on the regions outside the planes ( regions i or v ) and between them ( region iii ) , respectively , in a thermal equilibrium situation .    for this calculation ,",
    "we need the explicit solution for the field equation ( [ ecmovcampototal ] ) . considering the properties of the fundamental solutions @xmath61 ,",
    "the first step is to take the laplace transform of the equation in order to obtain    @xmath77    since we are interested in the long - time behaviour ( @xmath78 ) , we can omit terms containing the positions @xmath21 and momenta @xmath31 of the oscillators at @xmath19 . this assumption",
    "is well justified for @xmath79 , the scale associated with the damping or relaxation time of the environment .",
    "therefore , the equation for the field can be approximated by :    @xmath80    this is the equation for the laplace transform of the field , with the initial conditions and the laplace transform of the stochastic langevin force as sources . for simplicity , the spatial dependence of the matter terms was omitted , but it is important to remember that this expression is valid for the points inside the plates .",
    "note also that , as there is no contribution from the atoms to the sources , the field operator @xmath20 acts on @xmath15 as an identity .",
    "we propose a solution of the form @xmath81 , where two contributions are distinguished : the vacuum contribution @xmath82 , which results from the modified field modes ; and the langevin contribution @xmath83 , which depends linearly on the langevin forces .",
    "each contribution satisfies    @xmath84    @xmath85    it is worth to note that the first equation presents only operators acting on @xmath14 , thus the associated field contribution is an operator on that space . in the same way , the second equation depends only on operators acting on @xmath16 , and therefore the langevin contribution acts nontrivially only there . taking all this into account the field operator reads @xmath86    in summary , the atoms act like a _ bridge _ between the field and the thermal bath , making no contributions to the total field .",
    "the problem , then , has been completely separated into two parts , that will be computed in the next subsection .",
    "we will now solve the two independent eqs .",
    "( [ ecmovcampotransformadavacio1dtotal ] ) and ( [ ecmovcampotransformadalangevin1dtotal ] ) . for the vacuum contribution @xmath87 ,",
    "the solution for @xmath78 is assumed to have the form :    @xmath88\\frac{dk}{2\\pi}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{k}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\widehat{a}_{k}e^{-i\\omega_{k}t}f_{k}(x)+\\widehat{a}_{k}^{\\dag}e^{i\\omega_{k}t}f_{k}^{*}(x)\\right ) , \\label{operadorphidielectrico}\\ ] ]    where the first integral comprises the waves going from left to right , and the second one the waves going from right to left .",
    "the mode functions @xmath89 satisfy the equation :    @xmath90    the refractive index @xmath91 given by    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the plasma frecuency .",
    "it is worthy to note that eq.([ecmodosvacio1dtotal ] ) is of the same form that the equation for the modes in a nonabsorbing dielectric medium @xcite , except that in this case the refractive index is frecuency - dependent . on the other hand , eq.([indicerefracciontotal ] )",
    "depends on the fourier transform of the damping kernel , which is associated to a general environment .",
    "there is no assumption neither about the spectral density of the environment nor on the value of the equilibrium temperature . in the next section",
    "we will analyze in more detail the relation between the electromagnetic response of the medium and the spectral density .    the eq .",
    "( [ ecmodosvacio1dtotal ] ) for the modes can be solved by imposing continuity of the mode functions @xmath94 at all interfaces .",
    "the calculation is long but straightforward and is described in appendix a.    in order to obtain the langevin contribution , we must solve eq .",
    "( [ ecmovcampotransformadalangevin1dtotal ] ) .",
    "since the interaction begins at @xmath19 , the equations for the laplace and fourier transforms for this contribution are identical , and related by @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the long - time solution can be written as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 satisfies    @xmath98    in regions i , iii and v ; and ,    @xmath99    in regions ii and iv .",
    "here @xmath100 is the fourier transform of the stochastic force operator .",
    "the explicit solution is presented in appendix b.    in section iv we will use the vacuum and langevin contributions to the field operator in order to obtain the casimir force between slabs . before doing that",
    ", we will describe in more detail the relation between the macroscopic electromagnetic properties of the slabs and the microscopic model .",
    "with the aim of checking if our model is physically consistent , we will analyze the properties of the refraction index given in eq.([indicerefracciontotal ] ) . considering that @xmath101 is the permittivity of the material plates",
    ", we have :    @xmath102    we can define the susceptibility kernel @xmath103 for the model as @xcite @xmath104 in principle , this integral can be evaluated by contour integration .",
    "inversely , the permittivity can be expressed in terms of @xmath103 as : @xmath105 which can be viewed as a representation of @xmath106 in the complex @xmath44-plane .",
    "the permittivity is well defined when @xmath103 is finite for all @xmath107 and @xmath108 as @xmath109 , and its analytical properties can be studied directly from this expression .",
    "all properties of the permittivity and susceptibility functions are strongly dependent on the laplace transform of the damping kernel @xmath110 , which in turn depends on the spectral density of the environment . after taking the laplace tranform of eq.([qbmnucleoamortiguamiento ] ) , we obtain    @xmath111    as already described , a physical spectral density must incorporate a cutoff function .",
    "one could use a sharp cutoff or , alternatively , choose a continuous cutoff function that approaches zero rapidly for frequencies greater than the cutoff frequency @xmath45 , ensuring the convergence of the integral .    the first alternative , although simpler , makes the function @xmath110 not well - defined in the complex plane .",
    "the second alternative solves this problem and allows the use of the residue theorem to evaluate the integral . inserting eq.([qbmdensidadespectralentornos ] ) into eq.([nucleoamortiguamientolaplace ] ) , we obtain    @xmath112    in order to apply the residue theorem the integrand must be holomorphic on the superior complex half - plane , except in a finite number of points which are not on the real axis .",
    "thus , different results are obtained considering distributions with or without poles on the superior half - plane . for an ohmic environment ( @xmath50 ) and no cutoff function",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath113 .    in the case of distributions without poles ( for example , a gaussian cutoff function ) , we have :    @xmath114    where the subscript np denotes the fact that the distribution has no poles .",
    "the resulting function is real and even in the variable @xmath115 .",
    "on the other hand , the distributions usually considered in the literature have poles on @xmath116 ( for example , a lorentzian distribution ) . in these cases , for odd @xmath117 ( with @xmath118 to mantain the convergence in eq.([nucleoamortiguamientolaplaceconj ] ) ) , we get    @xmath119    where the subscripts on @xmath120 denote the location of the pole .",
    "although the resulting function is complex , the second equality in eq.([gammatransformadaiksinpolos ] ) remains valid .",
    "taking into account the above properties of the damping kernel , we now continue analyzing the properties of the permittivity and susceptiblility functions . as a particular example , in the drude model one has @xmath121 .",
    "therefore the denominator in eq.([susceptibility ] ) has two poles , both in the lower half @xmath44-plane .",
    "thus , as expected from a physical point of view , the susceptibility kernel shows a causal behavior , since it vanishes for @xmath122 .",
    "the analyticity of @xmath106 in the upper half @xmath44-plane allows the use of cauchy s theorem , resulting in the well - known kramers - kronig relations for the real and imaginary part of the permittivity function @xmath106 .    in our more general case ,",
    "the physical properties of @xmath106 are determined by the function @xmath123 .",
    "this dissipation function is given by the theory of quantum open systems through eqs.([gammatransformadaiksinpolos ] ) and ( [ gammatransformadaikconpolos ] ) , and depends on the chosen cutoff function .",
    "let us first consider , for simplicity , the case in which the cutoff function has no poles , represented by the eq.([gammatransformadaiksinpolos ] ) . for a given spectral density , the denominator in eq.([susceptibility ] )",
    "reads @xmath124    if we choose an ohmic environment ( @xmath50 ) and no cutoff function ( which is equivalent to put @xmath125 ) , we reobtain the drude model ( if @xmath126 ) or the one - resonance model ( when @xmath127 ) . in principle , we could consider other values of @xmath49 while keeping @xmath125 . in this case",
    ", @xmath117 should be an odd function .",
    "for example , @xmath128 gives an ill - defined pole configuration , since one of the poles lies on the upper half @xmath44-plane , breaking the analyticity of the integrand in eq.([susceptibility ] ) , and resulting in a non - causal susceptibility , which turns out to be unphysical .",
    "therefore we see that for this supraohmic environment the use of a cutoff is unavoidable .",
    "we may use an analytical cutoff ( like a gaussian function ) , or a lorentzian cutoff function .",
    "the first alternative leads to a denominator @xmath129 whose zeroes can not be obtained analytically . the second alternative , valid for @xmath118 such that @xmath117 is an odd function , leads to a denominator @xmath130 which for @xmath128 gives @xmath131    we denote the zeroes of @xmath132 as @xmath133 ( with @xmath134 ) .",
    "the three roots turn out to be located in the lower half @xmath44-plane , which ensures the causality property .",
    "also , one of the roots is purely imaginary ( @xmath135 ) and the others two have the same ( negative ) imaginary part but opposite real parts ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "thus , the susceptibility kernel reads    @xmath137\\right]\\theta(\\tau ) , \\label{susceptibilityp3}\\ ] ]    where it is clear that it is a causal real function and , due to the negativity of the imaginary part of the roots @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 for @xmath140 as is expected .",
    "we also have that @xmath141 but @xmath142 , and therefore the asymptotic expression found in @xcite still remains valid , as well as the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "it is worth noting that an ohmic environment ( @xmath50 ) can be also studied with a cutoff function , obtaining similar results .",
    "all in all , we have shown that our model is physically consistent and generalizes previous results for the permittivity of absorbing media , including as particular case the drude model .",
    "plasma - like models do not contain dissipation and can be obtained by taking @xmath143 , that corresponds to no coupling between the system and the bath .",
    "once determined the two contributions to the field , we proceed to compute the casimir force between the plates as given by eq .",
    "( [ fcasimirpresion ] ) . for this purpose , it is necessary to compute the expectation value of @xmath144 which is given by eq .",
    "( [ t001d ] ) .    considering the vacuum and langevin contributions according to eq.([separacioncontribuciones ] ) ,",
    "we have    @xmath145    it is worth to remark that there are cross terms which act over two parts of the total hilbert space .",
    "as we are interested in the steady state of the system , which is assumed at thermal equilibrium , each part of the total density matrix is represented by a thermal - type density matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "both field contributions @xmath87 and @xmath146 are linear on the annihilation and creation operators of their respective parts of the total hilbert space .",
    "thus , the cross terms do not contribute to the force in the case of thermal equilibrium .",
    "then , the problem is reduced to compute the expectation values over thermal states of the operators @xmath147 and @xmath148 , i.e. ,    @xmath149    thus , the casimir force also have two contributions : @xmath150      for the vacuum contribution , @xmath147 is quadratic in the annihilation and creation operators . thus , in order compute the expectation value over the thermal state , we need to evaluate the expectation values of the products of the annihilation and creation operators .",
    "these are given by the known expressions : @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath154 .",

    "the equation is valid for a general environment : the refraction index is in general complex , and dependent on the function @xmath110 , which comes from the interactions at the microscopic level .",
    "the associated permittivity depends on the type of environment , and reproduces known results ( as the drude model ) as particular examples .      in this section",
    "we will study some properties and limits of our final result eq.([fuerzacasimirtotalfinal2 ] ) .",
    "let us first study the convergence of this expression . in general , the casimir force calculations involve several regularization methods to achieve a finite result .",
    "a usual approach is to introduce a high frequency cutoff , in order to take into account that real materials are transparent at high frequencies .",
    "this characteristic is already incorporated in our model .",
    "indeed , the complex refraction index @xmath195 includes all the environment properties which produce dissipation and noise . for large values of @xmath115 , taking into account eq.([indicerefracciontotal ] )",
    "one can check that    @xmath196    @xmath197    then , in the same limit the reflection coefficient @xmath8 behaves as    @xmath198    and in consequence the integrand of eq.([fuerzacasimirtotalfinal2 ] ) is @xmath199 for large values of @xmath115 .",
    "thus the convergence is ensured when @xmath200 , regardless the temperature and the type of environment considered .    on the other hand , eq.([fuerzacasimirtotalfinal2 ] ) contains as particular cases some known results .",
    "the non - absorbing medium case can be easily obtained by setting the relaxation constant @xmath201 in all the expressions .",
    "this makes the refraction index real , which cancel the langevin contribution in eq.([fuerzacasimirlangevintotal ] ) since the factor @xmath202 .",
    "thus , only the vacuum contribution in eq.([fuerzacasimirvaciototal ] ) survives but with a real refraction index @xcite .",
    "another important limit is the well - known lifshitz formula . in the original work @xcite , lifshitz considered semispaces separated by a finite distance .",

    "@xmath205 , we must take into account that @xmath206 has poles on the imaginary axis at the matsubara frequencies @xmath207 .",

    "it is interesting to remark that in our simplified @xmath0 model there is no discontinuity in the transition between the drude and plasma models .",
    "the drude model is recovered , in the ohmic environment case , by setting @xmath126 ( i.e. free particles instead of harmonic oscillators for modelling the dielectric atoms ) and , once this limit is taken , the plasma model corresponds to the particular case @xmath208 ( no coupling to the environment ) .",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath209 in the zero frequency limit , for any value of @xmath210 and @xmath211 , even setting @xmath208 from the beginning . in the case of absence of coupling to an environment , of course one must assume thermal equilibrium .",
    "analogies between thermodynamics of a free brownian particle and that of an electromagnetic field between two mirrors of finite conductivity have been studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "given that we are assuming thermal equilibrium between the different parts of the system , the results presented in this paper for the casimir force could be derived following a functional approach in euclidean space , as described for instance in refs .",
    "we mention briefly the relation between both approaches .",
    "as is well known , in @xmath0 dimensions the free energy @xmath212 for a quantum system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath56 can be computed as @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the partition function when the plates are separated by a distance @xmath2 .",
    "the partition function can be represented by the functional integral @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the euclidean action for the full system .",
    "the integration is performed by imposing periodic boundary conditions on the temporal coordinate .    after integrating the matter and bath degrees of freedom it is possible to find an effective action for the scalar field of the form @xmath217 and the vacuum persistence amplitude reads @xmath218",
    "the effective action for the scalar field is quadratic because of the linear coupling we are choosing for the interaction between the vacuum field and the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "the potential @xmath219 is different from zero only inside the plates , and as in our model the field @xmath220 interacts only with the atom at @xmath221 , it can be shown that the potential is of the form @xmath222 . the function @xmath223 encodes the information about the interaction of the vacuum field with the matter degrees of freedom , and also of the influence of the thermal bath .",
    "its fourier transform is related to the reflection coefficient of the slab .",
    "formally , the vacuum persistence amplitude is given by the functional determinant @xmath224 \\big)^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\;.\\ ] ] an explicit evaluation of this determinant leads to lifshitz formula @xcite .",
    "so when considering thermal equilibrium , one has an alternative route to the evaluation of the casimir force , even when the field is coupled to other degrees of freedom .",
    "however , this euclidean functional approach would not be adequate to compute the force for more other initial states or , in general , in nonequilibrium situations . in that cases ,",
    "the use of the theory of quantum open systems as described in this paper is unavoidable .",
    "in this paper we have presented a derivation of the casimir force between two absorbing slabs in the framework of the theory of quantum open systems .",
    "we worked with a simplified model of a scalar vacuum field in @xmath0 dimensions . in order to describe the interaction of the vacuum field with the mirrors",
    ", we considered a model analogous to the hb model for qed , where the matter degrees of freedom are described by a continuous set of harmonic oscillators , which are coupled not only to the vacuum field but also to a thermal bath that accounts for dissipative effects .    following a standard procedure in the theory of quantum open systems",
    ", we showed that the field operator satisfies the modified klein gordon equation ( [ ecmovcampototal ] ) .",
    "this is a nonlocal langevin equation , which describes the interaction of the vacuum field with the matter degrees of freedom and the effects of the thermal bath on its dynamics ( the environment is indirectly coupled to the quantum field through the matter ) .",
    "this equation is similar to the one that describes a brownian particle coupled to an environment . both the noise and dissipation",
    "are determined by the properties of the environment .",
    "the field operator that solves this `` klein gordon- langevin '' equation can be written as the sum of two terms , a vacuum contribution and a langevin contribution .",
    "the same happens with the associated energy - momentum tensor , and therefore we have a similar decomposition for the casimir force between slabs .",
    "the final result for the total casimir force is equivalent to a @xmath0-version of the lifshitz formula , expressed in terms of the reflection coefficients associated to the slabs .",
    "therefore , we have presented , in this simplified model , a first - principles derivation of lifshitz formula in the framework of quantum open systems .",
    "the present work is closely related to ref .",
    "@xcite , that has been improved and generalized in several directions .",
    "indeed , that work assumes the simplest forms for noise and dissipation ( ohmic environment and constant dissipation ) , without specifying the properties of the environment .",
    "moreover it is doubtful whether a general non - ohmic environment can produce such effects at @xmath1 .",
    "here we worked at @xmath205 , and considered very general environments .",
    "we also linked the properties of the environment with the macroscopic electromagnetic properties of the mirrors .",
    "there is also a close relation with the recent work @xcite , where the authors computed the force density associated to spatial variations of the permittivity .",
    "as compared with ours , in this reference the authors considered the more realistic case of @xmath225 electromagnetic field , but only in the particular case of @xmath1 and constant dissipation .",
    "moreover , they did not consider the presence of boundaries as we did here , which allowed us to compute explicitly the casimir force between slabs and to obtain lifshitz formula .    in order to apply the quantum open systems approach to a realistic calculation of the casimir force",
    ", we should generalize our results to a @xmath225 model with the electromagnetic field .",
    "although technically more complex , we do not expect conceptual complications in doing so .",
    "regarding the long standing controversy about the temperature corrections to the casimir force , a crucial point is the behavior of the quantity @xmath226\\nonumber , \\ ] ] which vanishes for the drude model and is different from zero for the plasma model , producing in the last case an additional contribution to the force coming from the te zero mode . in the kind of microscopic models considered here ,",
    "the te zero mode is suppressed as long as @xmath227 , as can be seen from eq.([permittivity ] ) .",
    "finally , in the @xmath225 dimensional models one could consider more general initial states and/or non - equilibrium situations . we hope to address this issue in a forthcoming publication .",
    "this work was supported by uba , conicet and anpcyt .",
    "in this appendix we present the explicit form of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ ecmodosvacio1dtotal ] ) . en each region",
    "we have :    @xmath228    @xmath229    @xmath230    @xmath231    @xmath232    the different coefficients can be obtained by imposing continuity of the mode functions and their derivatives at the interfaces .",
    "they are given by :    @xmath233    @xmath234    @xmath235    @xmath236    @xmath237    @xmath238    @xmath239    @xmath240    for @xmath241 ( while for @xmath242 the order of the solutions must be reversed and the refractive index and the coefficients should be conjugated ) , where @xmath243 and @xmath244 are the reflection and transmission coefficients for one plate , while @xmath245 and @xmath246 are the ones for an interface . the coefficients @xmath247 and @xmath248 can be interpreted as the reflection and transmission coefficients of the two plates configuration . however , it should be noted that , due to the presence of absorption , @xmath249 and @xmath250 in this case .",
    "in this appendix we solve the equations ( [ ecmovcampofourierlangevin1dreg135total ] ) and ( [ ecmovcampofourierlangevin1dreg24total ] ) . due to the presence of a source in regions ii and iv ( see eq .",
    "( [ ecmovcampofourierlangevin1dreg24total ] ) ) , the solutions will have to parts : one associated to the homogeneous equation and other related directly to the source .",
    "therefore , the solutions are :                                                        the langevin contribution is evaluated in the five regions .",
    "since @xmath277 and @xmath278 depend linearly on the fourier transform of the stochastic force operator , it should be noted that the coefficients also depend on the same way .",
    "in fact , since the stochastic force operator depend linearly on the bath s annihilation and creation operators , the langevin contribution depend in that way too .",
