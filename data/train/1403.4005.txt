    "in order to establish a link to experiments , every physical theory needs to define the notions of observers and observables . from an experimentalist s point of view",
    ", an observation is the process of an observer performing an experiment in which he measures a number of physical quantities , called observables .",
    "each measured observable is expressed by a single number or a set of numbers . in order to understand the meaning of these numbers from a theorist s point of view , and thus in a mathematical language ,",
    "observers and observables must be modeled by mathematical objects , which can in turn be related to the outcomes of measurements .",
    "this model determines how the result of an observation depends on the observer who is performing it , and how the results obtained by different observers can be related to each other . in this work",
    "we will focus on geometric models for these relations .",
    "we start our discussion from the viewpoint of general relativity .",
    "the most basic notion of general relativity is that of spacetime , which is modeled by a smooth manifold @xmath0 equipped with a pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath1 of lorentzian signature @xmath2 , an orientation and a time orientation .",
    "observers are modeled by world lines , which are smooth , future directed , timelike curves @xmath3 .",
    "their tangent vectors satisfy @xmath4 by a reparametrization we can always normalize the tangent vectors , so that @xmath5 in this case we call the curve parameter the proper time along the world line @xmath6 and denote it by the letter @xmath7 instead of @xmath8 .",
    "the proper time along a timelike curve with arbitrary parametrization is given by the arc length integral @xmath9 the clock postulate of general relativity states that any clock moving along the world line @xmath6 measures the proper time , independent of the construction of the clock .",
    "the prescription for the measurement of time is thus crucially linked to the lorentzian metric of spacetime .",
    "similarly , the metric provides a definition of rulers and the length of spacelike curves by the same expression   of the arc length integral .",
    "finally , it also defines the angle @xmath10 between two tangent vectors @xmath11 at the same point @xmath12 as @xmath13 in summary , the lorentzian metric @xmath1 defines the _ geometry of spacetime_.    closely related to the geometry of spacetime is the notion of causality .",
    "it answers the question which events on a spacetime manifold @xmath0 can have a causal influence on which other events on @xmath0 .",
    "an event at @xmath12 can influence an event @xmath14 if and only if there exists a continuous , future directed , causal ( i.e. , timelike or lightlike ) curve from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "all events which can be influenced by @xmath15 constitute the causal future of @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , all events which can influence @xmath16 form the causal past of @xmath16 .",
    "this structure , called the _ causal structure of spacetime _ , is defined by the metric geometry via the definition of causal curves .",
    "the lorentzian spacetime metric serves several further purposes besides providing a definition of spacetime geometry and causality .",
    "we have already seen that it enters the definition of observer world lines as timelike curves , whose notion is thus also relevant when we consider the measurements of observables by these observers .",
    "observables are modeled by tensor fields , which are smooth sections @xmath17 of a tensor bundle @xmath18 over @xmath0 .",
    "their dynamics are consequently modeled by tensorial equations , which are derived from a diffeomorphism - invariant action of the generic form @xmath19 where the lagrange function @xmath20 depends on the metric geometry , the fields and their derivatives . combining the notions of observers and observables we may define an observation by an observer with world line @xmath6 at proper time @xmath7 as a measurement of the field @xmath21 at the point @xmath22 .",
    "however , this definition yields us an element of the tensor space @xmath23 , and not a set of numbers , as we initially presumed . we further need to choose a frame ,",
    "by which we denote a basis @xmath24 of the tangent space @xmath25 .",
    "this frame allows us to express the tensor @xmath21 in terms of its components with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the tensor components of @xmath21 are finally the numeric quantities which are measured in an experiment .",
    "the frame @xmath24 chosen by an observer to make measurements is usually not completely arbitrary . since the basis vectors @xmath26 are elements of the tangent space , they are characterized as being timelike , lightlike or spacelike and possess units of time or length .",
    "we can thus use the notions of time , length and angles defined by the spacetime metric to choose an orthonormal frame satisfying the condition @xmath27 with one unit timelike vector @xmath28 and three unit spacelike vectors @xmath29 . the clock postulate that proper time",
    "is measured by the arc length along the observer world line @xmath6 further implies a canonical choice of the timelike vector @xmath28 as the tangent vector @xmath30 to the observer world line .",
    "this observer adapted orthonormal frame is a convenient choice for most measurements .",
    "it follows immediately from this model of observables and observations how the measurements of the same observable made by two coincident observers , whose world lines @xmath6 and @xmath31 meet at a common spacetime point @xmath32 , must be translated between their frames of reference .",
    "if both observer frames @xmath24 and @xmath33 are orthonormalized , the condition   implies that they are related by a lorentz transform @xmath34 .",
    "the same lorentz transform must then be applied to the tensor components measured by one observer in order to obtain the tensor components measured by the other observer , using the standard formula @xmath35 this close connection between observations made using different observer frames constitutes the principle of local lorentz invariance .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that we model the geometry of spacetime , which in turn defines the notion of orthonormal frames , by a lorentzian metric .",
    "even deeper implications arise from the fact that we model both observables and geometry by tensor fields on the spacetime manifold @xmath0 , and observations by measurements of tensor components .",
    "if we introduce coordinates on @xmath0 and use their coordinate base in order to express the components of tensor fields , it immediately follows how these components translate under a change of coordinates .",
    "moreover , since we model the dynamics of physical quantities by tensor equations , they are independent of any choice of coordinates .",
    "this coordinate freedom constitutes the principle of general covariance .",
    "besides its role in providing the background geometry which enters the definition of observers , observations and causality , the lorentzian metric of spacetime has a physical interpretation on its own , being the field which carries the _",
    "gravitational interaction_. it does not only govern the dynamics of matter fields , but is also influenced by their presence .",
    "this is reflected by the dynamics of gravity , which is governed by the einstein - hilbert action @xmath36 which together with the matter action   yields the einstein equations @xmath37 understanding the geometry of spacetime as a dynamical quantity , which mutually interacts with matter fields , establishes a symmetric picture between both matter and gravity .    however , it is exactly this symmetry between gravity and matter which may lead us to new insights on the nature of spacetime geometry , and even question its description in terms of a lorentzian metric , from which we derived a number of conclusions as stated above .",
    "this stems from the fact that all known matter fields in the standard model are nowadays described by quantum theories .",
    "while the process of quantization has been successfully applied to matter fields even beyond the standard model , it is significantly harder in the case of gravity .",
    "this difficulty has lead to a plethora of different approaches towards quantum gravity , many of which suggest modifications to the geometry of spacetime , or even resolve the unity of spacetime into a time evolution of spatial geometry .",
    "main contenders which fall into this class are given by geometrodynamic theories such as loop quantum gravity  @xcite and sum - over - histories formulations such as spin foam models  @xcite or causal dynamical triangulations  @xcite .",
    "theories of this type introduce non - tensorial quantities , which may in turn suggest a breaking of general covariance at least at the quantum level .",
    "moreover , other approaches to gravity may induce a breaking of local lorentz invariance , for example , by a preferred class of observers , or test particles , described by a future unit timelike vector field  @xcite .",
    "the possible observer dependence of physical quantities beyond tensorial transformations motivates the introduction of spacetime geometries obeying a similar observer dependence , which generalize the well - known lorentzian metric geometry . in this work we review and discuss two different , albeit similar , approaches to observer dependent geometries under the aspects of observers , causality and gravity . in section  [ sec : finsler ] we review the concept of finsler spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "we show that it naturally generalizes the causal structure of lorentzian spacetimes , provides clear definitions of observers , observables and observations , serves as a background geometry for field theories and constitutes a model for gravity .",
    "in section  [ sec : cartan ] we review the concept of observer space in terms of cartan geometry  @xcite .",
    "our discussion is based on the preceding discussion of finsler spacetimes , from which we translate the notions of observers and gravity to cartan language  @xcite .",
    "we finally ponder the question which implications observer dependent geometries have on the nature of spacetime .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the metric geometry of spacetime serves multiple roles : it provides a causal structure , crucially enters the definition of observers , defines measures for length , time and angles and mediates the gravitational interaction . in this section",
    "we discuss a more general , non - metric spacetime geometry which is complete in the sense that it serves all of these roles .",
    "this generalized geometry is based on the concept of finsler geometry  @xcite .",
    "models of this type have been introduced as extensions to einstein and string gravity  @xcite . in this work",
    "we employ the finsler spacetime framework  @xcite , which is an extension of the well - known concept of finsler geometry to lorentzian signature , and review some of its properties and physical applications .",
    "this framework is of particular interest since , in addition to its aforementioned completeness , it can also be used to model small deviations from metric geometry and provides a possible explanation of the fly - by anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our discussion is the clock postulate , which states that the time measured by an observer s clock moving along a timelike curve @xmath6 is the proper time @xmath7 given by the arc length integral  .",
    "the expression @xmath38 under the integral depends on both the position @xmath39 along the curve and the tangent vector @xmath40 .",
    "hence , it can be regarded as a function @xmath41 on the tangent bundle .",
    "the clock postulate thus states that the proper time measured by an observer s clock is given by the integral @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the function on the tangent bundle given by equation  .    for convenience",
    "we introduce a particular set @xmath44 of coordinates on @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be coordinates on @xmath0 . for @xmath47",
    "we then use the coordinates @xmath48 defined by @xmath49 we call these coordinates induced by the coordinates @xmath46 . as a further shorthand notation we use @xmath50 for the coordinate basis of @xmath51 .",
    "we now introduce a different , non - metric geometry of spacetime which still implements the clock postulate in the form of an arc length integral  , but with a more general function @xmath43 on the tangent bundle .",
    "geometries of this type are known as finsler geometries , and @xmath43 is denoted the finsler function .",
    "the choice of @xmath43 we make here is not completely arbitrary . in order for the arc length integral to be well - defined and to obtain a suitable notion of spacetime geometry we need to preserve a few properties of the metric - induced finsler function  . in particular we will consider only finsler functions which satisfy the following :    .    [ finsler : fpositive ] @xmath43 is non - negative , @xmath52 .",
    "[ finsler : fsmooth ] @xmath43 is a continuous function on the tangent bundle @xmath45 and smooth where it is non - vanishing , i.e. , on @xmath53 .",
    "[ finsler : fhomorev ] @xmath43 is positively homogeneous of degree one in the fiber coordinates and reversible , i.e. , @xmath54    property  [ finsler : fpositive ] guarantees that the length of a curve is non - negative . we can not demand strict positivity here , since already in the metric case we have the notion of lightlike curves @xmath6 , for which @xmath55 .",
    "for the same reason of compatibility with the special case of a lorentzian spacetime metric we can not demand that @xmath43 is smooth on all of @xmath45 , since the metric finsler function   does not satisfy this condition .",
    "it does , however , satisfy the weaker condition  [ finsler : fsmooth ] , which guarantees that the arc length integral depends smoothly on deformations of the curve @xmath6 , unless these pass the critical region where @xmath56 . finally , we demand that the arc length integral is invariant under changes of the parametrization and on the direction in which the curve is traversed , which is guaranteed by condition  [ finsler : fhomorev ]",
    ".    one may ask whether the lorentzian metric @xmath57 can be recovered in case the finsler function is given by  .",
    "indeed , the finsler metric @xmath58 which is defined everywhere on @xmath53 , agrees with @xmath57 whenever @xmath59 is spacelike and with @xmath60 when @xmath59 is timelike . however , for null vectors where @xmath56 we see that the finsler metric @xmath61 is not well - defined , since for a general finsler function @xmath62 will not be differentiable . as a consequence any quantities derived from the metric , such as connections and curvatures , are not defined along the null structure , which renders this type of geometry useless for the description of lightlike geodesics . in the following",
    "we will therefore adopt the following definition of finsler spacetimes which remedies this shortcoming  @xcite :    a _ finsler spacetime _",
    "@xmath63 is a four - dimensional , connected , hausdorff , paracompact , smooth manifold @xmath0 equipped with continuous real functions @xmath64 on the tangent bundle @xmath45 which has the following properties :    .",
    "[ finsler : lsmooth ] @xmath65 is smooth on the tangent bundle without the zero section @xmath66 .",
    "[ finsler : lhomogeneous ] @xmath65 is positively homogeneous of real degree @xmath67 with respect to the fiber coordinates of @xmath45 , @xmath68 and defines the finsler function @xmath43 via @xmath69 .",
    "[ finsler : lreversible ] @xmath65 is reversible : @xmath70 .",
    "[ finsler : lhessian ] the hessian @xmath71 of @xmath65 with respect to the fiber coordinates is non - degenerate on @xmath72 , where @xmath73 has measure zero and does not contain the null set @xmath74 .",
    "[ finsler : timelike ] the unit timelike condition holds , i.e. , for all @xmath12 the set @xmath75 with @xmath76 contains a non - empty closed connected component @xmath77 .",
    "one can show that the finsler function @xmath43 induced from the fundamental geometry function @xmath65 defined above indeed satisfies the conditions  [ finsler : fpositive ] to  [ finsler : fhomorev ] we required .",
    "further , the finsler metric   is defined on @xmath78 and is non - degenerate on @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the degeneracy set of the hessian @xmath81 defined in condition  [ finsler : lhessian ] above .",
    "this definition in terms of the smooth fundamental geometry function @xmath65 will be the basis of our discussion of finsler spacetimes in the following sections , where we will see that it also extends the definitions of other geometrical structures such as connections and curvatures to the null structure .",
    "the first aspect we discuss is the causal structure of finsler spacetimes and the definition of observer trajectories . for this purpose",
    "we first examine the causal structure of metric spacetimes from the viewpoint of finsler geometry , before we come to the general case .",
    "we have already mentioned in the introduction that the definition of causal curves is given by the split of the tangent spaces into timelike , spacelike and lightlike vectors .",
    "figure  [ fig : smcausal ] shows this split induced by the lorentzian metric on the tangent space @xmath25 .",
    "solid lines mark the light cone which is constituted by null vectors . in terms of the fundamental geometry function @xmath82",
    "these are given by the condition @xmath83 .",
    "outside the light cone we have spacelike vectors with @xmath84 , while inside the light cone we have timelike vectors with @xmath85 .",
    "the hessian @xmath86 therefore has the signature indicated in condition  [ finsler : timelike ] inside the light cone .",
    "in both the future and the past light cones we find a closed subset with @xmath87 . using the time orientation",
    "we pick one of these subsets and denote it the shell @xmath88 of future unit timelike vectors .     in the tangent space of a metric spacetime",
    "@xcite.,width=272 ]    the shell @xmath88 has the important property that rescaling yields a convex cone @xmath89 the convexity of this cone is crucial for the interpretation of the elements of @xmath88 as tangent vectors to observer world lines , as it is closely linked to the hyperbolicity of the dispersion relations of massive particles and the positivity of particle energies measured by an observer  @xcite .",
    "we require this property also for the future light cone of a finsler spacetime . in order to find this structure in terms of the fundamental geometry function",
    "@xmath65 consider the simple bimetric example @xmath90 with two lorentzian metrics @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where we assume that the light cone of @xmath92 lies in the interior of the light cone of @xmath91 .",
    "the sign of @xmath65 and the signature of @xmath81 on the tangent space @xmath25 are shown in figure  [ fig : bmcausal ] .",
    "solid lines mark the null structure @xmath93 , while the dashed - dotted lines marks the degeneracy set @xmath94 of @xmath65 as defined in condition  [ finsler : lhessian ] .",
    "the remaining dashed and dotted lines mark the unit timelike vectors @xmath95 as defined in condition  [ finsler : timelike ] ; for these only the future directed tangent vectors are shown . the connected component marked by the dashed line is closed , while the one marked with the dotted line is not .",
    "hence , the former marks the set @xmath88 .",
    "as the figure indicates , the set   indeed forms a convex cone for this simple bimetric example .",
    "it can be shown that condition  [ finsler : timelike ] always implies the existence of a convex cone of observers  @xcite , in consistency with the requirement stated above .     in the tangent space of a bimetric finsler spacetime  @xcite.,width=498 ]",
    "it is now straightforward to define :    a physical _ observer world line _ on a finsler spacetime is a curve @xmath3 such that at all times @xmath8 the tangent vector @xmath40 lies inside the forward light cone @xmath96 , or in the unit timelike shell @xmath97 if the curve parameter is given by the proper time @xmath7 .    in the following section we will discuss which of these observers are further singled out by the finsler spacetime geometry as being inertial observers .      in the preceding section",
    "we have seen which trajectories are allowed for physical observers .",
    "we now turn our focus to a particular class of observers who follow the trajectories of freely falling test masses .",
    "these are denoted inertial observers , since in their local frame of reference gravitational effects can be neglected . on a metric spacetime",
    "they are given by those trajectories which extremize the arc lenth integral  .",
    "in finsler geometry we can analogously obtain them from extremizing the proper time integral  .",
    "variation with respect to the curve yields the equation of motion @xmath98 where the coefficients",
    "@xmath99 are given by the following definition :    the coefficients @xmath99 of the _ cartan non - linear connection _ are given by @xmath100\\ ] ] and define a connection in the sense that they induce a split of the tangent bundle over @xmath45 , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is spanned by @xmath103 and @xmath104 is spanned by @xmath105 .",
    "in the case of a metric - induced finsler function   the coefficients @xmath99 are given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the christoffel symbols .",
    "the split   of @xmath108 into horizontal and vertical subbundles plays an important role in finsler geometry , as we will see in the following sections . for convenience",
    "we use the following adapted basis of @xmath108 :    the _ berwald basis _ is the basis @xmath109 of @xmath108 which respects the split induced by the cartan non - linear connection .    for the dual basis",
    "we use the notation @xmath110 it induces a similar split of the cotangent bundle @xmath111 into the subbundles @xmath112 we can now reformulate the geodesic equation   by making use of the geometry on @xmath108 . for this purpose",
    "we canonically lift the curve @xmath6 to a curve @xmath113 in @xmath108 .",
    "the condition that @xmath6 is a finsler geodesic then translates into the condition @xmath114 since @xmath115 is simply the tangent bundle coordinate @xmath116 , it thus follows that the canonical lift @xmath117 of a finsler geodesic must be an integral curve of the vector field which is defined as follows :    the _ geodesic spray _",
    "@xmath118 is the vector field on @xmath45 which is defined by @xmath119    we now generalize this statement to null geodesics . here",
    "we encounter two problems .",
    "first , we see that the coefficients   of the non - linear connection are not well - defined for null vectors where @xmath56 , since @xmath43 is not differentiable on the null structure .",
    "we therefore need to rewrite their definition in terms of the fundamental geometry function @xmath65 .",
    "it turns out that it takes the same form @xmath120\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath121 has been replaced by @xmath122 and @xmath62 by @xmath65 .",
    "we can see that this is well - defined whenever @xmath122 is non - degenerate , and thus in particular on the null structure .",
    "the second problem we encounter is that we derived the geodesic equation from extremizing the action  , which vanishes identically in the case of null curves .",
    "we therefore need to use the constrained action @xmath123 = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\left(l(\\gamma(t),\\dot{\\gamma}(t ) ) + \\lambda(t)[l(\\gamma(t),\\dot{\\gamma}(t ) ) - \\kappa]\\right)dt\\ ] ] with a lagrange multiplier @xmath124 and a constant @xmath125 .",
    "a thorough analysis shows that the equations of motion derived from this action are equivalent to the geodesic equation   also for null curves  @xcite .",
    "the definitions of this and the preceding section provide us with the notions of general and inertial observers . in the following section",
    "we will discuss how these observers measure physical quantities and how the observations by different observers can be related .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the notion of geometry in physics defines not only causality and the allowed trajectories of observers , but also their possible observations and the relation between observations made by different observers . in the case of metric spacetime geometry",
    "we have argued that observations are constituted by measurements of the components of tensor fields at a spacetime point @xmath12 with respect to a local frame @xmath24 at @xmath15 . a particular class of frames singled out by the geometry and most convenient for measurements is given by the orthonormal frames .",
    "different observations at the same spacetime point , but made with different local orthonormal frames , are related by lorentz transforms . in this section",
    "we discuss a similar definition of observations on finsler spacetimes and relate the observations made by different observers .    as a first step",
    "we need to generalize the notion of observables from metric spacetimes to finsler spacetimes . in their definition in section  [ subsec : finslerdef ]",
    "we have already seen that the geometry of finsler spacetimes is defined by a homogeneous function @xmath126 on the tangent bundle , which in turn induces a finsler function @xmath43 and a finsler metric @xmath61 .",
    "these geometric objects explicitly depend not only on the manifold coordinates @xmath127 , but also on the coordinates @xmath116 along the fibers of the tangent bundle @xmath45 .",
    "it therefore appears natural that also observables should be functions not on the spacetime manifold , but homogeneous functions on its tangent bundle .",
    "a straightforward idea might thus be to model observables as homogeneous tensor fields over @xmath45 , i.e. , as sections of a tensor bundle @xmath128 however , since @xmath45 is an eight - dimensional manifold , each tensor index would then take eight values , so that the number of components of a tensor of rank @xmath129 would increase by a factor of @xmath130 .",
    "since we do not observe these additional tensor components in nature , we will not follow this idea .",
    "instead we define observables as tensor fields with respect to a different vector bundle over @xmath45 , whose fibers are four - dimensional vector spaces generalizing the tangent spaces of @xmath0 .    in the preceding section we have seen that the cartan non - linear connection   of a finsler spacetime equips the tangent bundle @xmath108 of @xmath45 with a split   into a horizontal subbundle @xmath102 and a vertical subbundle @xmath104 .",
    "the fibers of both subbundles are four - dimensional vector spaces .",
    "a particular section of @xmath102 , which we have already encountered and which is closely connected to finsler geodesics , is the geodesic spray  .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath102 as the bundle from which we define observables as follows :    the _ observables _ on a finsler spacetime are modeled by homogeneous horizontal tensor fields , i.e. , sections @xmath131 of the tensor bundle @xmath132 over the tangent bundle @xmath45 of @xmath0 .",
    "consequently we define observations in full analogy to the case of metric spacetime geometry :    an _ observation _ of an observable @xmath131 by an observer with world line @xmath6 at proper time @xmath7 is a measurement of the components of the horizontal tensor @xmath133 with respect to a basis @xmath24 of the horizontal tangent space @xmath134 at @xmath135 .",
    "as we have argued in the introduction , the most natural frame @xmath24 an observer on a metric spacetime can choose is an orthonormal frame whose temporal component @xmath28 agrees with his four - velocity @xmath30 .",
    "if we wish to generalize this concept to finsler spacetimes , we first need to map the basis vectors @xmath26 , which are now elements of @xmath102 , to @xmath45 . for this purpose",
    "we use the differential @xmath136 of the tangent bundle map @xmath137 , @xmath138 which isomorphically maps every horizontal tangent space @xmath134 to @xmath25 .",
    "we can then orthonormalize the frame using the finsler metric @xmath61 , which now explicitly depends on the observer s four - velocity @xmath139 . taking into account",
    "the signature @xmath140 of the finsler metric on timelike vectors inside the forward light cone we arrive at the following definition :    an _ orthonormal observer frame _ on an observer world line @xmath6 at proper time @xmath7 is a basis @xmath24 of the horizontal tangent space @xmath134 at @xmath135 which has @xmath139 and is orthonormal with respect to the finsler metric , @xmath141    an important property of metric spacetimes is the fact that any two orthonormal observer frames @xmath142 at the same spacetime point @xmath12 are related by a unique lorentz transform . together with the definition that observations yield tensor components this property implies local lorentz invariance , which means that the outcomes of measurements are related by the standard formula  .",
    "we now generalize this concept to finsler spacetimes . for this purpose",
    "we consider two coincident observers whose world lines @xmath143 meet at @xmath32 together with orthonormal frames @xmath142 at @xmath15 .",
    "one immediately encounters the difficulty that @xmath24 and @xmath33 are now bases of different vector spaces @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we therefore need to find a map between these vector spaces which in particular preserves the notion of orthonormality .",
    "the canonical map given by the isomorphisms @xmath146 and @xmath147 , however , does not have this property . in the following",
    "we will therefore discuss a different map which will yield the desired generalization of lorentz transformations .    in order to construct a map between the horizontal tangent spaces @xmath144 and",
    "@xmath145 we employ the concept of parallel transport .",
    "we thus need a connection on the horizontal tangent bundle @xmath102 with respect to which the finsler metric is covariantly constant , so that the notion of orthonormality is preserved . in finsler geometry an appropriate choice which satisfies these conditions is the cartan linear connection on the tangent bundle @xmath108 , which is defined as follows :    the _ cartan linear connection _",

    "this map @xmath154 in general depends on the choice of the curve @xmath161 . we therefore restrict ourselves to a particular class of curves .",
    "note that @xmath162 and @xmath163 have the same base point in @xmath0 , and are thus elements of the same fiber of the tangent bundle @xmath45 .",
    "hence it suffices to consider only curves which are fully contained in the same fiber .",
    "curves of this type are vertical , i.e. , their tangent vectors lie in the vertical tangent bundle @xmath104 .",
    "we further impose the condition that @xmath161 is an autoparallel of the cartan linear connection .",
    "this uniquely fixes the curve @xmath161 , provided that @xmath164 is in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath28 .    using the unique vertical autoparallel",
    "@xmath161 defined above we can now generalize the notion of lorentz transformations to coincident observers on a finsler spacetime . consider two observers meeting at @xmath12 and using frames @xmath24 and @xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. , orthonormal bases of @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the map @xmath154 maps the horizontal basis vectors @xmath26 to horizontal vectors @xmath165 , which constitute a basis @xmath166 of @xmath145",
    ". since @xmath24 is orthonormal with respect to @xmath167 and the cartan linear connection preserves the finsler metric , it follows that @xmath166 is orthonormal with respect to @xmath168 .",
    "since also @xmath33 is orthonormal with respect to the same metric , there exists a unique ordinary lorentz transform mapping @xmath166 to @xmath33 .",
    "the combination of the parallel transport along @xmath161 and this unique lorentz transform finally defines the desired generalized lorentz transform .",
    "the procedure to map bases of the horizontal tangent space between coincident observers further allows us to compare horizontal tensor components between these observers , so that they can communicate and compare their measurements of horizontal tensors .",
    "this corresponds to the transformation   of tensor components of observables between different observer frames in metric geometry . since observables in metric geometry",
    "are modeled by spacetime tensor fields , their observation in one frame determines the measured tensor components in any other frame .",
    "this is not true on finsler spacetimes , since we defined observables as fields on the tangent bundle @xmath45 .",
    "they may therefore also possess a non - tensorial , explicit dependence on the four - velocity of the observer who measures them .    as in metric geometry , also in finsler geometry the dynamics of tensor fields should be determined by a set of field equations which are derived from an action principle .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .      in the preceding section",
    "we have argued that observables on a finsler spacetime are modeled by homogeneous horizontal tensor fields , which are homogeneous sections of the horizontal tensor bundle  .",
    "we will now discuss the dynamics of these observable fields .",
    "for this purpose we will use a suitable generalization of the action   to horizontal tensor fields on a finsler spacetime .",
    "this will be done in two steps .",
    "first we will lift the volume form from the spacetime manifold @xmath0 to its tangent bundle @xmath45 , then we generalize the lagrange function @xmath20 to fields on a finsler spacetime .    in order to define a volume form on @xmath45 we proceed in analogy to the volume form of metric geometry , which means that we choose the volume form @xmath169 of a suitable metric @xmath170 on tm .",
    "we have already partly obtained this metric in the previous section when we discussed orthonormal observer frames .",
    "the definition of orthonormality we introduced corresponds to lifting the finsler metric @xmath61 to a horizontal metric on @xmath45 , which measures the length of horizontal vectors in @xmath102 .",
    "this metric needs to be complemented by a vertical metric , which analogously measures the length of vertical vectors in @xmath104 .",
    "both metrics together constitute the desired metric on the tangent bundle . the canonical choice for this metric is given by the sasaki metric defined as follows :    the _ sasaki metric _",
    "@xmath170 is the metric on the tangent bundle @xmath45 which is defined by @xmath171    the factor @xmath172 introduced here compensates for the intrinsic homogeneity of degree 1 of the one - forms @xmath173 , so that the sasaki metric is homogeneous of degree 0 .",
    "this intrinsic homogeneity becomes clear from the definition   of the dual berwald basis , taking into account that the coefficients @xmath99 are homogeneous of degree 1 , as can be seen from their definition  . using the volume form @xmath169 of the sasaki metric one can now integrate functions @xmath24 on the tangent bundle , @xmath174 if one chooses the function @xmath24 to be a suitable lagrange function @xmath20 for a physical field @xmath131 on a finsler spacetime , one encounters another difficulty . since all geometric structures and matter fields @xmath131 are homogeneous , it is natural to demand the same from the lagrange function .",
    "however , for a homogeneous function @xmath24 the integral over the tangent bundle generically diverges , unless the function vanishes identically .",
    "this follows from the fact that along any ray @xmath175 with @xmath176 in @xmath45 the value of @xmath24 is given by @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the degree of homogeneity .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by integrating the function not over @xmath45 , but over a smaller subset of @xmath45 which intersects each ray , which is not part of the null structure , exactly once , and which is defined as follows :    the _ unit tangent bundle _ of a finsler spacetime is the set @xmath179 on which the finsler function takes the value @xmath180 .    note that @xmath181 intersects each ray exactly once which is not part of the null structure .",
    "this suffices since the null structure is of measure 0 and therefore does not contribute to the integral   over @xmath45 .",
    "the canonical metric on @xmath181 is given by the restriction @xmath182 of the sasaki metric , which finally determines the volume form @xmath183 .",
    "this is the volume form we will use in the generalized action integral .    in the second part of our discussion",
    "we generalize the lagrange function @xmath20 in the metric matter action  . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves here to @xmath184-form fields @xmath131 whose lagrange function depends only on the field itself and its first derivatives @xmath185 .",
    "these are of particular interest since , e.g. , the klein - gordon and maxwell fields fall into this category .",
    "the most natural procedure to generalize the dynamics of a given field theory from metric to finsler geometry is then to simply keep the formal structure of its lagrange function @xmath20 , but to replace the lorentzian metric @xmath1 by the sasaki metric @xmath170 and to promote the @xmath184-form field @xmath131 to a horizontal @xmath184-form field on @xmath45 .",
    "the generalized lagrange function we obtain from this procedure is now a function on @xmath45 , which we can integrate over the subset @xmath181 to form an action integral .    using this procedure we encounter the problem that even though we have chosen @xmath131 to be horizontal , @xmath185 will in general not be horizontal . in order to obtain consistent field equations",
    "we therefore need to modify our procedure . instead of initially restricting ourselves to horizontal @xmath184-forms on the tangent bundle @xmath45 ,",
    "we let @xmath131 be an arbitrary @xmath184-form with both horizontal and vertical components .",
    "the purely horizontal components can then be obtained by applying the horizontal projector @xmath186 in order to reduce the number of physical degrees of freedom to only these horizontal components we dynamically impose that the non - horizontal components vanish by introducing a suitable set of lagrange multipliers @xmath124 , so that the total action reads @xmath187_{\\sigma}\\,.\\ ] ] variation with respect to the lagrange multipliers then yields the constraint that the vertical components of @xmath131 vanish .",
    "variation with respect to these vertical components fixes the lagrange multipliers .",
    "finally , variation with respect to the horizontal components of @xmath131 yields the desired field equations .",
    "it can be shown that in the metric limit they reduce to the usual field equations derived from the action   for matter fields on a metric spacetime  @xcite .      in the previous sections we have considered the geometry of finsler spacetimes solely as a background geometry for observers , point masses and matter fields .",
    "we now turn our focus to the dynamics of finsler geometry itself .",
    "as it is also the case for lorentzian geometry , we will identify these dynamics with the dynamics of gravity .",
    "for this purpose we need to generalize the einstein - hilbert action , from which the gravitational field equations are derived , and the energy - momentum tensor , which acts as the source of gravity .",
    "we start with a generalization of the einstein - hilbert action   to finsler spacetimes . as in the case of matter field theories detailed in the preceding section",
    "this generalized action will be an integral not over spacetime @xmath0 , but over the unit tangent bundle @xmath179 , since the geometry is defined in terms of the homogeneous fundamental geometry function @xmath65 on tm .",
    "we have already seen that a suitable volume form on @xmath181 is given by the volume form @xmath183 of the restricted sasaki metric  .",
    "this leaves us with the task of generalizing the ricci scalar @xmath188 in terms on finsler geometry .",
    "the most natural and fundamental notion of curvature is defined by the cartan non - linear connection  , which we already encountered in the definition of finsler geodesics in section  [ subsec : finslerpm ] and which corresponds to the unique split   of the tangent bundle @xmath108 into horizontal and vertical components .",
    "this split is also the basic ingredient for the following construction .",
    "the curvature of the cartan non - linear connection measures the non - integrability of the horizontal distribution @xmath102 , i.e. , the failure of the horizontal vector fields @xmath189 to be horizontal .",
    "in fact their lie brackets are vertical vector fields , which are used in the following definition :    the _ curvature of the non - linear connection _ is the quantity @xmath190 which measures the non - integrability of the horizontal distribution induced by the cartan non - linear connection , @xmath191 = ( \\delta_bn^c{}_a - \\delta_an^c{}_b)\\bar{\\partial}_c = r^c{}_{ab}\\bar{\\partial}_c\\,.\\ ] ]    the simplest scalar one can construct from the curvature coefficients defined by   is the contraction @xmath192 , so that the action for finsler gravity takes the form @xmath193 in the case of a metric - induced finsler function , in which the non - linear connection coefficients @xmath99 are given by  , the expression under the integral indeed reduces to the ricci scalar , so that @xmath194 is a direct generalization of the einstein - hilbert action  . in order to obtain a full gravitational theory this action needs to be complemented by a matter action , such as the field theory action   we encountered in the previous section .",
    "this total action then needs to be varied with respect to the mathematical object which fundamentally defines the spacetime geometry . on a finsler spacetime",
    "this is the fundamental geometry function @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , the gravitational field equations are not two - tensor equations as in general relativity , but instead the scalar equation @xmath195\\bigg|_{\\sigma } = \\kappa t|_{\\sigma}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] on the unit tangent bundle @xmath181 . here",
    "@xmath196 denotes the energy - momentum scalar obtained by variation of the matter action @xmath197 with respect to the fundamental geometry function @xmath65 . for the field theory action",
    "it is given by @xmath198\\right\\}\\right|_{\\sigma}\\,.\\ ] ] it can be shown that in the metric limit the resulting gravitational field equation   is equivalent to the einstein equations  , whose free indices are to be contracted with @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that also the cartan linear connection we used to define generalized lorentz transformations in section  [ subsec : finslerlt ] defines a notion of curvature , which may in principle be used to generalize the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "this curvature is defined as follows :    the _ curvature of the cartan linear connection _ is given by @xmath199}z\\ ] ] for vector fields @xmath200 on @xmath45 .",
    "using the action   of the cartan linear connection on the vector fields constituting the berwald basis and the coefficients   one finds that its curvature can be written in the form    @xmath201    where the coefficients are given by    [ eqn : clcurvcomp ] @xmath202    in the metric limit the coefficient @xmath203 reduces to the riemann tensor , while the remaining coefficients @xmath204 and @xmath205 vanish .",
    "one may therefore consider the term @xmath206 as another generalization of the ricci scalar to generate the gravitational dynamics on finsler spacetimes .",
    "we do not pursue this idea further here and only remark that also other choices are possible .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that on finsler spacetimes the definitions of observers and observables are promoted from geometrical structures on the spacetime manifold @xmath0 to homogeneous geometrical structures on its tangent bundle @xmath45 , and that this homogeneity fixes quantities on @xmath45 when they are given on the unit tangent bundle @xmath181 .",
    "we have also seen that measurements by an observer probe these structures along a lifted world line @xmath207 in @xmath45 .",
    "however , it follows from the definition of physical observer trajectories that every curve @xmath117 is entirely confined to future unit timelike vectors , so that observations can be performed only on a smaller subset @xmath208 , which we denote observer space . in this section",
    "we will therefore restrict our discussion to observer space and equip it with a suitable geometrical structure in terms of cartan geometry  @xcite , which we derive from the previously defined finsler geometry  @xcite .",
    "while cartan geometry turns out to be useful already as a geometry for spacetime in the context of gravity  @xcite , it becomes even more interesting as a geometry for observer space  @xcite and provides a better insight into the role of lorentz symmetry in canonical quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "we start our discussion with the definition of observer space as the space of all tangent vectors to a finsler spacetime which are allowed as tangent vectors of normalized observer trajectories , i.e. , observer trajectories which are parametrized by their proper time .",
    "this leads us to the definition :    the _ observer space _",
    "@xmath209 of a finsler spacetime @xmath63 is the set of all future unit timelike vectors , i.e. , the union @xmath210 of all unit shells inside the forward light cones .",
    "note that @xmath209 is a seven - dimensional submanifold of @xmath45 and that its tangent spaces @xmath211 are spanned by the vectors @xmath212 which satisfy @xmath213 .",
    "further , there exists a canonical projection @xmath214 onto the underlying spacetime manifold .",
    "the natural question arises which geometrical structure the finsler geometry on the spacetime manifold @xmath0 induces on its observer space @xmath209 .",
    "the structure which is most obvious already from our findings in the previous section is the restricted sasaki metric @xmath215 , which we defined in   as the restriction of the full sasaki metric @xmath170 to @xmath181 and which we now view as a metric on the smaller set @xmath208 .",
    "it follows from the signature of @xmath170 that @xmath215 has lorentzian signature @xmath216 .",
    "another structure which we already encountered in the previous section is the geodesic spray  . since it preserves the finsler function , @xmath217 , it is tangent to the level sets of @xmath43 , and thus in particular tangent to observer space @xmath209 .",
    "it therefore restricts to a vector field on @xmath209 , which we denote the reeb vector field :    the _ reeb vector field _",

    "indeed it turns out that the volume form defined by @xmath220 is simply the volume form of the sasaki metric @xmath215 on @xmath209 .",

    "a similar split also applies to the tangent bundle @xmath225 of observer space .",

    "is to start from general relativity , rewrite the einstein - hilbert action in terms of the cartan connection derived from the metric geometry displayed in section  [ subsec : cartanintro ] , and finally transform the action to an integral over observer space by introducing an appropriate volume form on the fibers of @xmath214 .",

    "we can write the killing form as @xmath409 and the hodge star operator as @xmath410 the two - form @xmath411 is given by the unique decomposition @xmath412 of the @xmath237-valued cartan curvature   into parts with values in @xmath256 and @xmath274 .",
    "finally , the tilde indicates that we need to lower this two - form @xmath411 on the frame bundle @xmath240 to a two - form @xmath413 on the base manifold @xmath0 .",
    "we now aim to lift the action   to observer space . for this purpose",

    "the total action thus takes the final form @xmath430 from this we see that we obtain an action based on the curvature of the cartan linear connection , as we have briefly discussed towards the end of section  [ subsec : finslergravity ] , provided that we have chosen a model space @xmath232 for which @xmath431 .",
    "we also find that we always obtain a non - zero cosmological constant term .",
    "the magnitude of the physical cosmological constant can be adjusted by introducing suitable numerical factors into the algebra relations  , which corresponds to a rescaling of the basis vectors @xmath270 .      in the previous sections we have discussed the physics on finsler spacetimes in the language of cartan geometry . for this purpose",
    "we considered a principal @xmath298-bundle @xmath297 over observer space @xmath209 and equipped it with a cartan connection @xmath243 derived from finsler geometry .",
    "this construction allowed us to reformulate significant aspects of finsler spacetime in purely cartan geometric terms : the definition of physical and inertial observers , the split of the tangent bundle @xmath225 into horizontal and vertical components which crucially enters the definition of observables and physical fields , the sasaki metric and its volume measure on @xmath209 and finally the dynamics of gravity .",
    "it should be remarked that these formulations can be applied to any cartan geometry @xmath432 modeled on @xmath300 , since they do not explicitly refer to the underlying finsler geometry , or even the spacetime manifold @xmath0 .",
    "this observation stipulates the question whether an underlying spacetime geometry is at all required , or may not even exist , at least as a fundamental object . in this final section",
    "we will discuss this question .",
    "we first discuss whether and how we can reconstruct the finsler spacetime @xmath63 if we are given only its observer space cartan geometry @xmath432 , together with the presumption that an underlying finsler spacetime exists .",
    "recall from its definition   that the observer space @xmath209 of a finsler spacetime is the ( disjoint ) union of the future unit timelike shells @xmath88 for all spacetime points @xmath12 .",
    "every spacetime point @xmath15 thus corresponds to a non - empty subset @xmath88 of @xmath209 . reconstructing the spacetime manifold from its observer space therefore amounts to specifying an equivalence relation which decomposes @xmath209 into subsets , and to equipping the resulting set of equivalence classes with the structure of a differentiable manifold",
    "this can be done by making use of the vertical distribution @xmath227 , which is tangent to the shells @xmath88 and can be expressed completely in terms of cartan geometry as the span of the vector fields @xmath433 defined in  . from our presumption",
    "that an underlying spacetime manifold exists it follows that @xmath227 is integrable .",
    "the frobenius theorem then guarantees that @xmath227 can be integrated to a foliation of @xmath209 , with projection @xmath214 onto its leaf space , and further that @xmath0 carries the structure of a differentiable manifold so that @xmath434 becomes a smooth submersion .",
    "the aforementioned procedure allows us to reconstruct the spacetime manifold @xmath0 from observer space cartan geometry .",
    "if we now aim to reconstruct also its finsler geometry on @xmath45 , we immediately see that this will be possible at most for vectors which lie inside the forward light cones @xmath435 .",
    "this comes from the fact that in the construction of the cartan geometry on @xmath209 we used only the finsler geometry on the shells @xmath88 , which yields the finsler geometry on @xmath435 by rescaling and using its homogeneity properties .",
    "this means that we can not reconstruct the finsler geometry on spacelike or lightlike vectors , and in particular we can not reconstruct the null structure of a finsler spacetime .    in order to reconstruct the finsler function @xmath43 on the future light cones we need to reconstruct the embedding @xmath436 of observer space into the tangent bundle of the spacetime manifold @xmath0 . for this purpose",
    "we make use of the properties of observer trajectories .",
    "recall that in section  [ subsec : finslerpm ] we applied the canonical lift   to a curve @xmath6 on @xmath0 in order to obtain a curve @xmath117 on @xmath45 , and concluded that the canonical lifts of observer trajectories on @xmath209 are exactly those curves @xmath117 whose horizontal tangent vector components are given by the reeb vector field   in section  [ subsec : cartanpm ] .",
    "we can therefore proceed as follows .",
    "for @xmath346 we choose an observer trajectory @xmath117 in @xmath209 so that @xmath437 .",
    "we then project @xmath117 to a curve @xmath6 on @xmath0 using the projection @xmath434 .",
    "the tangent vector @xmath30 , which we identify with @xmath348 via the embedding @xmath391 , is then related to @xmath370 via the differential @xmath228 .",
    "this relation yields the formula @xmath438 where we have used the fact that @xmath228 isomorphically maps the horizontal tangent space @xmath384 to @xmath439 .",
    "the embedding @xmath391 is thus simply given by @xmath440 finally , we obtain the finsler function on timelike vectors by imposing @xmath180 on the image @xmath441 and the homogeneity  .",
    "note that @xmath65 can be any homogeneous function @xmath442 here , since @xmath43 is smooth when restricted to the timelike vectors .",
    "we now turn our focus to a general cartan geometry @xmath432 modeled on @xmath300 for which we do not presume the existence of an underlying finsler geometry or even a spacetime manifold .",
    "indeed the latter will in general not exist , as we can already deduce from the reconstruction of a finsler spacetime detailed above .",
    "there we have seen that spacetime naturally appears as the leaf space of a foliation , which we obtained by integrating the vertical distribution @xmath227 on observer space .",
    "this procedure fails if @xmath227 is non - integrable .",
    "further , even if @xmath227 integrates to a foliation of @xmath209 , this foliation may not be strictly simple , i.e. , its leaf space may not carry the structure of a differentiable manifold .",
    "this means that only a limited class of observer space cartan geometries , including those derived from finsler spacetimes , admit for an underlying spacetime manifold .",
    "further , even if a spacetime exists , it may not be a finsler spacetime , since the reconstructed metric   may not be the sasaki metric induced by finsler geometry .",
    "the question arises whether we can still assign a meaningful physical interpretation to an observer space cartan geometry if its vertical distribution is non - integrable , so that there is no underlying spacetime .",
    "since any physical interpretation should be given based on the measurement of dynamical , physical quantities by observers , this amounts to the question whether these can meaningfully be defined on an arbitrary observer space cartan geometry .",
    "we have provided these definitions throughout our discussion of observer space in section  [ sec : cartan ] of this work .",
    "our findings suggest that the notion of spacetime is not needed as a fundamental ingredient in the definition of physical observations , but rather appears as a derived object for a restricted class of cartan geometries .",
    "the author is happy to thank steffen gielen , christian pfeifer and derek wise for their helpful comments and discussions .",
