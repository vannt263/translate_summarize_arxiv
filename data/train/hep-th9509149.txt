    "infinities and singularities in physical theories are signals that the theory in question is inconsistent or incomplete , and force physicists to uncover deeper structures .",
    "much of twentieth century physics has arisen from such singularities ; two notable examples are the ultraviolet catastrophes of classical thermodynamics which helped drive the development of quantum mechanics , and the infinities in field theory loop calculations which helped drive the development and understanding of the renormalization group .    among the theories which we currently use to describe the world , general relativity",
    "remains doubly afflicted : at the quantum level it is nonrenormalizable , and at the classical level it contains singularities , as demonstrated by the well - known singularity theorems of hawking and penrose ( penrose 1965 , hawking 1967 , hawking and penrose 1970 ) . with both of these singularities",
    "we are faced with the problem of predictability .",
    "nonrenormalizability tells us that there must be a very different description of the world at the planck scale , but gives no clue as to what that description might be .",
    "classical spacetime singularities defined via geodesic incompleteness tell us that in finite proper time , we will reach regions of spacetime beyond which we can not evolve the dynamical equations of the theory .",
    "of course , if we attempt to cure this classical problem by quantizing the theory , we must contend with the nonrenormalizability of the theory .",
    "one subject of active research which may force physicists to face these two problems directly is the apparent evaporation of black holes via quantum particle production ( hawking 1974 ) .",
    "it is our belief that to understand the outcome of the hawking process we must eventually understand the physics near the singularity . in particular this seems to be the primary lesson taught by the study of two - dimensional dilatonic black holes ; at some point the singularity and the apparent horizon coincide and one needs some prescription for dealing with the singularity at this point in order to understand the final state of the black hole ( see strominger 1995 and references therein ) . to date there have been several proposals for the what endpoint the of black hole evaporation process might be  ( for critical reviews and references see banks 1994 and strominger 1995 ) ; many of these proposals rely on low - energy physics up to the point that the black hole reaches the planck mass , and then propose plausible consistent completions of the evaporation process , without recourse to a planck - scale theory .",
    "nonetheless , it remains to be shown explicitly that any of these proposals are the result of a complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "thus , if we claim to understand quantum gravity , we must understand and remove the singularities that seem to plague it .",
    "this is hardly a new enterprise , and while we are not capable of producing a full history of previous attempts to do so , one may divide the attempts into two categories :    * evasion of some tenet of the singularity theorems * searching for a breakdown of the notion of classical spacetime in a region of strong curvature , via quantum mechanics or string theory    the most natural way to avoid the singularity theorems is to violate the condition @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the ricci tensor and @xmath2 is a timelike or null vector field depending on which theorem one appeals to ) ; the other conditions involve global hyperbolicity of the spacetime ( although this condition is non - essential ) , the lack of closed timelike loops , and the existence of trapped surfaces ( which occurs given a sufficient concentration of matter ( schoen and yau 1983 ) ) , and are physically too attractive to casually dismiss . the singularity theorems are based on feeding equation back into the raychaudhuri equation ; in general relativity one can then use einstein s equations to relate equation to the strong or the null energy conditions . to avoid the singularity",
    "theorems one must then either violate the appropriate energy conditions , or suitably modify einstein gravity so that equation is violated . in particular ,",
    "quantum fields violate the energy conditions ( epstein  1965 )",
    ".    in the long run simply adding terms to einstein s equations or relaxing energy conditions may not seem entirely satisfactory : we know that as we approach large field gradients close to the singularity , quantum geometry and ( sub)planckian physics come into play .",
    "still , at this point the burden is on the theorist to explain what exactly quantum geometry is , and then to show that quantum mechanics combined with one s favorite choice of a planck scale theory is not also singular , especially given the nonrenormalizability of einstein gravity .    in this paper",
    "we would like to examine gravitational singularities using quantum string theory . to do this",
    "we should redefine singularities in terms of extended objects and quantum mechanics ; we can do this with fairly natural extensions of geodesic completeness .",
    "classically , we require that the solutions to the string equations of motion never cause the string to leave the spacetime in finite proper worldsheet distance .",
    "quantum mechanically , we require that the first - quantized wave operator be well - defined and hermitian everywhere . with these definitions",
    "we can discuss three types of singularities : singular sources of classical fields (  charged point particles ) , timelike singularities , and spacelike singularities occurring ( in a suitably defined coordinate system ) at some point in time .",
    "singular classical sources are easily dealt with : they arise generally from considering particles as point - like objects . in a first - quantized theory",
    "quantum mechanics smears out the wave function of a test particle enough to avoid any pathology at the source , so long as the singularity in the potential is weaker than @xmath3 ( which is the case for the known forces of nature . ) in quantum field theory calculations , we get divergences from large loop momenta and from small impact parameters . these are results of not properly regulating the theory at short distances .",
    "timelike singularities , of which the aforementioned singularities are a subset , are also not generically troublesome .",
    "it is strongly believed that string theory has a minimum distance and thus soft high - energy behavior , due to the extended nature of the fundamental objects .",
    "this has been shown to resolve many potential timelike singularities in the theory , most notably in amplitudes for high - energy scattering ( gross and mende 1987 , 1988 ) , orbifold singularities ( dixon  1985 , 1986 ) , and singularities arising from the degeneration of khler structures in calabi - yau manifolds ( aspinwall  1993 and 1994 , witten 1993 ) .",
    "this good behavior arises from the apparent lack of any operative definition of a point in string theory : no point on a given string can carry a finite fraction of the string s energy , so that any momentum transfer in a stringy scattering process is shared by the entire string .",
    "we should note that we do not want to smooth out _ all _ timelike singularities .",
    "horowitz and myers ( 1995 ) have argued that any stable theory with einstein gravity as a low - energy limit must have solutions with timelike singularities arising from singular initial conditions ; in particular , a solution which looks like a negative - mass schwarzschild solution at large distances should be singular even in a full theory of quantum gravity ( remember that the total mass is measured at infinity , where only the einstein term in the effective action will contribute ) .",
    "if we can not throw away such solutions the theory becomes unstable since there is no stable ground state ,  empty space decays by pair - producing these negative - energy lumps ( horowitz and myers , 1995 ) .",
    "spacelike singularities pose a genuinely serious and confusing dilemma , as they occur entirely because of the universally attractive nature of gravity past the event horizon , where the causal structure forces classical matter to collapse completely .",
    "these facts seem to be independent of the ultraviolet nature of the theory .",
    "so , while the singularity is an ultraviolet object and perhaps will be resolved by physics similar to that which resolves timelike singularities , their inevitable nature and the fact that they arise from a rather soft attractive force begs for a careful examination . at any rate it is safe to say that we do not have as much control over these singularities in string theory as we have over the known timelike singularities , and so those of us who hope that string theory describes nature must still confront spacelike singularities .",
    "the first words uttered by string theorists when faced with singular backgrounds is that they are simply signs that the expansion of the spacetime effective action in powers of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the characteristic length over which the curvature changes , breaks down .",
    "yet there are known _",
    "exact_conformal theories that possess spacelike singularities , the best known example being the 2-dimensional @xmath6 black hole , ( witten 1991 ) .",
    "one might then appeal to string loop corrections to the @xmath7-functions ( lovelace 1986 , fischler and susskind 1986 , callan  1987 ) . while we will argue below that string loop effects are part of the story",
    ", we should be careful .",
    "for example , there are gravitational plane - wave backgrounds with null singularities , for which string propagation is singular ( horowitz and steif 1990a and 1990b , de vega and sanchez 1992 ) .",
    "these backgrounds correspond to exact conformal theories at tree level ( amati and klimcik 1989 , horowitz and steif 1990a ) because all interesting counterterms that one might produce from the riemann tensor , the dilaton , or the antisymmetric tensor field , will vanish ; for the same reason loop corrections to the background will also vanish .",
    "however , it should be noted that these null singularities by definition do not arise from nonsingular initial conditions .",
    "we should also recall the arguments of horowitz and myers ( 1985 ) mentioned above : if corrections to the low energy effective action generically tame singular backgrounds , we should worry that the theory is unstable .",
    "the aforementioned string theorist would next point out that corrections to the effective action are not the end of the story ; for example , strings propagating in orbifold geometries are quantum mechanically well behaved at the orbifold points .",
    "the lesson here is that we should relax our definition of singularities somewhat , and define them as regions of the background for which the wave operator for string theory becomes undefined , thus properly including orbifold geometries and some degenerations of khler geometries as nonsingular backgrounds .",
    "this definition is a natural extension of geodesic completeness as it defines a singularity as the point at which predictability , here defined as the ability to evolve quantum wave functions , breaks down .",
    "this relaxed definition does not save us from spacelike singularities .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 operator in the @xmath6 black hole background becomes ill - defined at the singularity : string wave functions (  tachyon vertex operators ) blow up at the singularity ( dijkgraaf  1992 ) . in order to support our claim that @xmath9 corrections and the properties of quantum wave functions in string theory do not in general save us from spacelike singularities , we will in the appendix review arguments which indicate that the structure of higher - dimensional black hole singularities is described by a perturbation of the @xmath6 black hole .",
    "note also that the caveats of horowitz and myers ( 1995 ) apply to quantum mechanical smoothing as well .",
    "none of this is to say that there is no solution to the problem of spacelike singularities in string theory , or that the answer does not involve the short - distance properties of string theory ; rather , we simply wish to emphasize that the problem has not been solved and that it requires some care . in the light of these arguments ,",
    "this paper is an attempt to reach a primitive understanding of the quantum dynamics of string field theory in singular backgrounds , as a precursor to understanding the full quantum evolution of the background .",
    "we will make this attempt by first examining the spacetime background near the singularity and noting its generic and essential features , and then by examining string propagation in singular backgrounds , and finally by trying to crudely understand string field theory in a simplified spacetime background for which the scale factor changes over a brief period of time .",
    "we will find that the density of produced strings in a given state is exponentially suppressed by the mass of that state times the inverse rate of expansion , @xmath10 , so that when this rate becomes as large as @xmath11 , the density of states overwhelms the suppression and an infinite number of highly energetic long strings are produced .",
    "one may object that it is not legitimate to quantize string field theory in a classical background spacetime without explicitly taking backreaction into account from the start ; however , since string theory has an as adjustable dimensionless parameter the ratio @xmath12 far from the black hole , we may make this parameter small and see if string theory resolves the singularity in the weakly coupled region where we have some hope of knowing what to do .",
    "our result indicates a sort of paradox , of which we see two possible resolutions : either stringy backreaction must smooth the singularity , or there is a hagedorn - like phase transition as the density of produced strings becomes comparable to a string mass per unit string volume .",
    "in the former case we will suggest that the combination of an equation of state for string matter derived by gasperini  ( 1991a , b ) and the effects of the dilaton ( tseytlin and vafa 1992 ) potentially cause spacetime to become non - singular . without thinking too much , one could imagine a few scenarios .",
    "for example , the spacetime could stabilize as expansion or contraction cease , with the dilaton kinetic energy balancing the produced energy density as the spacetime runs to strong coupling .",
    "another possibility is that the singular region relaxes to some de - sitter like phase , as suggested by frolov  ( 1990 ) ( see also poisson and israel 1988 ) for the case of particle field theory , based on a limiting - curvature hypothesis for quantum gravity .",
    "one of us ( martinec 1995 ) proposed a realization of this latter possibility by appealing to t - duality : this paper arose from that work , although we no longer feel that the duality properties of string theory are necessarily relevant for our purposes .",
    "our arguments will be crude and will ignore many issues such as the conformal invariance of the background , but we will argue that we have captured the physics of the effects we are interested in and that what we have ignored will not invalidate our results .    since our proposals depend on the time - dependent nature of the singularities we are interested in , they may not apply to timelike singularities ; the sorts of timelike singularities which horowitz and myers ( 1995 ) discuss may remain singular as required for the stability of flat space . as a limiting case , the singular null - fronted plane wave spacetimes described by horowitz and steif ( 1990 ) and de vega and sanchez ( 1992 ) will have no particle creation ( and no string creation ) due to the presence of a null killing vector , so that in this borderline case the singularity is untamed by our scenarios .",
    "the remainder of the paper shall be organized as follows : in section 2 we will review features of singular backgrounds in general relativity and string theory . in the case of string theory , we will examine the cosmological equations of tseytlin and vafa ( 1992 ) with respect to various phenomenological energy - momentum tensors that one may imagine , and discuss the singularities that may arise in these equations .",
    "in section 3 we will describe string propagation in expanding and/or contracting backgrounds , reviewing the work of gasperini , sanchez , and veneziano ( sanchez and veneziano 1990 , gasperini  1991a , b ) .",
    "we will use a similar approximation to examine the propagation of large strings in a temporarily expanding model .",
    "we will also discuss the equation of state for string matter in these models . in section 4",
    "we will discuss free quantum string field theory in curved backgrounds , and describe techniques for computing approximations to the rate of string production in such backgrounds . in section 5 we will apply these techniques to a specific isotropically expanding model and find the aforementioned singularity in the rate of string production .",
    "in section 6 we will discuss how one might extend this calculation to an anisotropic model and what features one might look for ; we will also discuss how the produced matter , given the equation of state discussed in section 3 , might affect the singularity . section 7 will contain our conclusions and further speculations . appendix",
    "a will discuss how one might relate the @xmath6 black hole to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz ( lifshitz and khalatnikov 1963 , belinskii  1970 , 1982 ) have argued that the spacetime metric close to a spacelike singularity can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are functions of the spatial coordinates only , and the @xmath14 satisfy the equations @xmath18 which are identical to the restrictions on the spatially independent exponents @xmath14 in a vacuum kasner spacetime : @xmath19 equation is found by expanding einstein s equations in a power series in @xmath20 , assuming a power law singularity in the metric , with the leading exponents as shown : one finds that contributions from the intrinsic curvature of the spatial slices are subleading as compared to their extrinsic curvature ( though there is the requirement that , if @xmath21 is the negative exponent , @xmath22 , which means that we may use the direction specified by @xmath15 as a global coordinate ) .",
    "this means that the spacetime is `` velocity - dominated '' in this region .",
    "if we look on a reasonably small spatial slice , the metric should look like the kasner metric .",
    "the form is certainly what we find near the schwarzschild singularity : the metric inside the horizon ( @xmath23 ) for a d - dimensional schwarzschild black hole is @xmath24^{-1}dr^{2 } + \\left[\\left(\\frac{r_{h}}{r}\\right)^{d-3}-1\\right ] dt^{2}+r^{2}d\\omega_{d-2}^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\sim & -\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{h}}\\right)^{d-3}dr^{2 } + \\left(\\frac{r_{h}}{r}\\right)^{d-3}dt^{2 } + r^{2}d\\omega_{d-2}^{2}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we write @xmath25(r / r_{h})^{(d-1)/2}$ ] , and @xmath26 , we can rewrite the most singular part of the metric as @xmath27^{-2(d-3)/(d-1 ) } d\\rho^{2 } + r_{h}^{2}\\left[\\frac{(d-1)t}{2r_{h}}\\right]^{4/(d-1 ) } d\\omega_{d-2}^{2}\\ .\\ ] ] note that in four dimensions the relations are satisfied .",
    "we conclude that the essential physics of the velocity - dominated singularity can be captured by looking at homogeneous anisotropic spacetimes .",
    "einstein s equations are contained in the lowest order @xmath7-function equations of string theory ( lovelace 1986 , callan  1985 , fradkin and tseytlin 1985 , sen 1985 ) ; one does not expect the schwarzschild solution to describe the geometry as one approaches the singularity , where higher order terms in the @xmath7-function equations become important .",
    "nonetheless it is worth repeating that there are exact conformal theories which contain spacelike singularities , including the @xmath6 black hole ( witten 1991 ) , various four dimensional black hole backgrounds consisting of the tensor product of this theory with other conformal field theories ( giddings  1993 , 1994 , johnson 1994 , lowe and strominger 1994 ) , and a four dimensional cosmological model , with initial and final singularities , constructed as a c=4 wzw model ( nappi and witten 1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , there are some indications that the @xmath6 black hole may be relevant for understanding the background near the singularity in higher - dimensional spacetimes ; we will review these indications in the appendix .",
    "we will start with something rather simpler than these exact conformal field theories , looking instead for homogeneous solutions to the one - loop beta functions for the metric coupled to the dilaton @xmath28 and matter with central charge @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the critical dimension of the string theory , @xmath31 is the number of macroscopic dimensions , and @xmath32 is the number of compactified dimensions .",
    "if we write the string frame metric as @xmath33 then the @xmath7-function equations can be written as ( tseytlin and vafa 1992 ) @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the energy density , and @xmath36 is the pressure in the direction of @xmath37 : these terms come from adding a phenomenological matter action to the low energy effective action that can be derived from the usual @xmath7-function equations .",
    "we may also include the effect of potential terms , such as that coming from a dilaton potential , in @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "in general @xmath39 will depend on how the matter couples to the dilaton . for a classical fundamental string source ,",
    "the total action without the antisymmetric tensor field is ( dabholkar and harvey 1989 , dabholkar  1990 ) @xmath40\\ , \\label{dabhact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the spacetime curvature , @xmath42 is the worldsheet curvature , and @xmath43 is the location of the worldsheet . here the fundamental string couples as a classical source , and thus lacks the @xmath44 factor .",
    "( we will discuss the justification for equation at the end of the following section . ) naturally , for multiple strings , one may sum the worldsheet action over the different sources , making the replacement @xmath45 \\longrightarrow \\sum_{i } s_{{\\rm worldsheet}}[x_{i}]\\ ] ] in equation . now",
    "if the stress tensor arises from a gas of classical strings , we expect that @xmath46 due to the lack of a dilaton prefactor in the worldsheet action ( veneziano 1991 , tseytlin 1992 ) .",
    "we will also get different values of @xmath39 depending on whether the matter comes from higher loop effects and so on ( tseytlin 1992 ) . in the particle production scenario we are proposing",
    ", the number density will be proportional to @xmath47 , so that we will set @xmath46 and let @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth noting that if we set the dilaton to be constant then equation has solutions only if @xmath50 in particular , for @xmath51 a constant dilaton and a homogeneous metric requires a radiation - like equation of state .",
    "many solutions to equation have been described by tseytlin ( 1992 ) : we would like to prepare for later discussions by sketching a few possible solutions .",
    "define a new field @xmath52 , and set @xmath46 ; then equation becomes @xmath53 ( tseytlin and vafa , 1992 ) .",
    "the first equation may be used to solve for @xmath54 , so that the second equation becomes @xmath55 with @xmath56 the solution will be a generalization of the kasner solution with @xmath57 ( tseytlin 1992 ) . note that this corresponds to the @xmath58 branch of the square root in equation .",
    "we wish to match this solution to the schwarzschild black hole near the singularity , which as we have argued can be approximated by a kasner metric .",
    "thus , we would start with the solution to equation corresponding to @xmath59 . at this point",
    "we assume that particle production begins ; what happens next depends on the details of the equation of state .",
    "in particular note that in order to turn around runaway expansion or contraction it is necessary that the pressure term become sufficiently large and negative for rapidly expanding spacetimes and sufficiently large and positive for rapidly contracting spacetimes .",
    "we will argue in the next section that string theory gives us exactly this sort of behavior .",
    "it is worth repeating here a point made by tseytlin and vafa ( 1992 ) . in einstein gravity",
    "we are used to any energy density at all contributing to the expansion of the universe , at least for a spatially flat cosmology where @xmath60 .",
    "we are arguing that a negative pressure may in fact provide a drag on the expansion .",
    "the difference is the presence of the dilaton , which is an embarrassment for phenomenology but may be a blessing when dealing with singularities .",
    "note also that runaway expansion or even a sufficient ammount of ( positive ) energy density will cause the dilaton to run to infinite coupling in finite time , making string loops especially important . on the other hand",
    ", sufficient contraction and insufficient energy density can cause the dilaton to run to weak coupling .",
    "sanchez and veneziano ( 1990 ) demonstrated that in a large class of inflationary spacetimes ( with a constant dilaton ) , certain string modes became unstable and begin growing with the scale factor .",
    "they argued that this happens when the string size becomes larger than the horizon size of the expansion , so that different parts of the string cease to communicate with each other .",
    "they showed that this occured potentially with power - law expansion and de sitter expansion , and inevitably with superinflationary expansion .",
    "gasperini  ( 1991a ) studied the approximate behavior of large strings in the homogeneous , isotropic metric @xmath61 which describes power - law inflation for @xmath62 , de sitter inflation for @xmath63 , and superinflation for @xmath64 .",
    "they found that for sufficiently large strings , the conformal time @xmath65 was proportional to the worldsheet time @xmath66 in conformal gauge , and that one could expand the solution to the classical equations of motion and virasoro constraints in a power series expansion in the worldsheet time @xmath66 and thus show that a consistent lowest - order solution to the equation of motion plus constraints is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the worldsheet spatial coordinate .",
    "note that in this approximation , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 as @xmath71 ( where the dot and prime refer to worldsheet time and space derivatives respectively ) , which is what one would expect from a large , slow string . in a follow - up paper ( gasperini  1991b ) , they showed that in rapidly contracting spacetimes one finds unstable behavior for which the worldsheet time is proportional to the _ comoving _  time @xmath20 ;",
    "the unstable behavior is characterized by @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "( the former condition came from a term of the form @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , which has a large time derivative as @xmath76 . )    instead of repeating the calculations described above , we shall instead perform a similar calculation to find the approximate behavior of very large strings in a temporarily expanding universe by using the string size , rather than the temporal distance to an infinite scale factor , as the expansion parameter .",
    "this will give us some intuition for the calculations we will perform in the following two sections .",
    "consider an isotropically expanding or contracting universe with metric @xmath77 the classical equations of motion and the classical constraints in conformal gauge for a string in this spacetime are : @xmath78 = 0 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\ddot{\\vec{x}}+\\vec{x}''-\\frac{c_{\\eta}}{c}\\left [ \\dot{\\eta}\\dot{\\vec{x } } - \\eta'\\vec{x}'\\right ] = 0 \\nonumber \\\\ & & c \\left[\\dot{\\eta}^{2}+\\eta^{'2}-\\dot{\\vec{x}}^{2}-\\vec{x}^{'2}\\right ] = 0\\nonumber\\\\ & & c\\left[-\\dot{\\eta}\\eta ' + \\dot{\\vec{x}}\\cdot\\vec{x}'\\right]=0\\ . \\label{fulleom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first two equations are the equations of motion and the last two are the virasoro constraints .",
    "we wish to expand these equations in a power series in the size of the string .",
    "let @xmath79 be the dimensionless length ,  the full length of the string divided by @xmath80 .",
    "following gasperini  ( 1991a ) , we assume that the time dependence of the spatial coordinates is of lower order . we thus expand @xmath81 in the series : @xmath82 where the @xmath83 are all of order @xmath80 .",
    "we must be a little careful about the the worldsheet time interval we are interested in .",
    "as we will see , the lowest order solution to the constraints is @xmath84 ; we will be interested below in universes which expand for a target space time interval of order @xmath10 , where @xmath85 , so that the worldsheet time interval of interest will be of order @xmath86 . in order to keep track of these factors explicitly",
    "let us define @xmath87 , so that @xmath88 will be of order 1 in this expansion",
    ". then we may expand @xmath65 in the series @xmath89 in general we should note that we must expand @xmath90 in a power series in @xmath86 as well , though this will not show up in the lowest order equations .",
    "these lowest order equations are @xmath91 where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath88 .",
    "one may solve these equations for arbitrary @xmath92 with @xmath93 ( so that we may absorb @xmath94 into @xmath95 and thus set @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 the interested reader may check these equations to the next order and verify that solutions exist given these first order solutions .",
    "note that in this case , just as in the case of the approach to the @xmath98 in the work of gasperini  ( 1991 ) , the comoving string coordinates are frozen to lowest order ( the time derivatives of @xmath81 are of order @xmath86 ) , so that the proper size of string will grow with the scale factor .",
    "we shall find that the same happens to the quantum wave functions below .",
    "if a large number of such unstable strings are produced as we will claim , we would like to know their equation of state ,  what the spacetime stress - energy tensor is for this collection of strings . for a single macroscopic string source ,",
    "the action for the background fields coupled to this source is given by equation .",
    "the stress tensor is then found by taking the derivative of this action with respect to the spacetime metric in the usual manner ( dabholkar and harvey 1989 , dabholkar  1990 ) : @xmath99 using this anstz for the stress tensor , gasperini  ( 1991b ) show that the approximate equation of state for unstable strings shrinking with the scale factor in a contracting universe is @xmath100 which is the equation of state for photon - like particles ; for unstable strings growing with the scale factor in an expanding universe ( 1991a ) they find that @xmath101 this is the sort of behavior we desired in the previous section , in order to remove the singularity , although for general anisotropic spacetimes we expect the equation of state to be more complicated .",
    "the anstz shown in equation for the coupling of a fundamental string source to the spacetime action still has the status of a conjecture , although there is evidence which supports it .",
    "callan and khuri ( 1991 ) , khuri ( 1993 ) and gauntlett  ( 1994 ) have found that using this expression and calculating the low - energy scattering of two such strings using collective coordinate methods , one can reproduce the scattering amplitudes found from the low - energy limit of the virasoro - shapiro amplitudes .",
    "tseytlin ( 1990 ) has attempted to derive equation by summing up long thin handles on the string worldsheet ( these are essentially wormholes on the worldsheet ) .",
    "this is a very attractive and probably correct answer but it requires that one make a connection between the spatial size of the macroscopic string and the dominance of `` thin handles '' in the integral over the moduli space of high - genus riemann surfaces .",
    "we do not understand how to connect spacetime scales to scales in these moduli spaces , and believe this to be an interesting problem .",
    "still , the intuition that large strings should be treated as sources of spacetime energy - momentum , and that this effect should arise from the summation of string loops describing the interaction of the macroscopic string with its surroundings , is physically fairly sound ; thus , if the effects of these strings are significant , we know that the dynamics of string theory causes certain classes of loop diagrams to become important , so that we must at least modify the @xmath7-function equations appropriately .",
    "( note that this is independent of another reason that loops might become important , namely that the dilaton may diverge near the singularity . )",
    "we shall comment on this point further in the conclusion .",
    "naturally , we would prefer to understand the full quantum mechanical behavior of string field theory near the singularity , where field strengths and quantum fluctuations are large ; we could then evolve the string field theory wave functional corresponding to the black hole background from a point where we trust our classical understanding of the geometry to the dangerous region near the classical singularity .",
    "unfortunately this computation would require a manifestly background independent quantum formulation of string field theory , not to mention a powerful computational control of that theory , both of which we lack .",
    "even in the case of ordinary field theory , if we had a quantum theory of gravity , we would still have to contend with questions of interpreting the strongly fluctuating spacetime near the singularity .",
    "we will thus adopt the standard approach of computing the quantum stress tensor of matter in a fixed background , in order to use it as a source term for the @xmath7-function equations of string theory .    as we stated in the introduction",
    ", this may be a reasonable approach for us . since we are given as an adjustable parameter @xmath102",
    ", we will perform our calculation in a regime where this ratio is small and we can trust the results of perturbative string theory ; then , string physics becomes important well before quantum fluctuations of spacetime become important .",
    "this is not necessarily the end of the story ; if the background is composed of strings , then at the string scale there is no clean separation between the background and the string fields we are quantizing on top of it .    in models with rapidly expanding directions",
    "there is another problem with keeping the background separate ; if gravitons become unstable and grow with the scale factor , then the background gravitons become macroscopic strings and we must discuss the background as a soup of macroscopic strings . perhaps there is some way of including this effect self - consistently to get some sort of modified @xmath7-function equations which are valid in these regimes . based on our discussion of macroscopic strings in the previous section",
    ", this would amount to the inclusion of a certain class of loop corrections to the @xmath7-function equations . for the present , however , we will not attack this problem ; rather , we will work in a background with a hubble volume much larger than one in string units , and extrapolate the result to @xmath103 . if we can do nothing else",
    ", we can at least argue that the above issues must eventually be addressed .",
    "what we would like to calculate is the renormalized stress - energy tensor for string fields in a singular background .",
    "this is difficult in particle field theory , and should be at least as difficult in string field theory .",
    "as we have mentioned previously , in string theory we have at our disposal a few exact conformal field theories with spacelike singularities ( witten 1991 , giddings  1993,1994 , johnson 1994 , lowe and strominger 1994 , nappi and witten 1992 ) .",
    "since these examples correspond to gauged wzw models we might have some hope of calculating @xmath104 exactly .",
    "however , several problems arise .",
    "the most natural calculation to perform is that of the one - loop expectation value @xmath105 in the first - quantized picture ( this expression is derived by taking the derivative of the first - quantized one - loop partition function  which should correspond to the spacetime one - loop effective action for the background fields ( fradkin and tseytlin 1985 ) ) . for this calculation",
    "we must know the expectation value for the general off - shell graviton vertex operator , and so we require an off - shell understanding of the theory that we do not now possess .",
    "in addition , we must ensure that we are computing this expectation value so that it corresponds to the appropriate second - quantized vacuum , which means we must find some sort of prescription for dealing with the poles in the string propagator ( recall that in particle field theory the vacuum is defined by the feynman propagator  see fulling s book ( fulling 1989 ) for a discussion ) .",
    "finally , the quantization of strings propagating on non - compact wzw and gauged wzw models is not well understood .",
    "given these problems , we will instead make a series of approximations in order to make the calculation tractable .",
    "first , we will ignore concerns about the conformal invariance of the background , which will allow us to work with simplified models of expanding spacetimes .",
    "second , we will work only with the @xmath8 constraint on the string wave functions , rather than the infinite number of equations arising from the full virasoro constraints .",
    "third , we will set the spacetime conformal time @xmath65 to be a function solely of the worldsheet time @xmath66 in conformal gauge ( otherwise , solving for the string configuration at a given @xmath65 becomes extremely difficult ) . finally , since we do not know how to compute the string energy - momentum tensor directly , we will compute the number of strings produced and from that calculation determine the stress - energy tensor .",
    "these approximations should not invalidate our results .",
    "first , we will be looking for semiclassical solutions to the string wave equation .",
    "as in the computation of the @xmath7-functions using the background field method , when expanding the first - quantized path integral of the string around a classical solution , violations of conformal invariance appear as logarithmic divergences in the quadratic fluctuation determinant .",
    "the effects we shall be interested in , namely the exponential dependence of the production amplitude on the energy , come from the classical term @xmath106 of the wave function .",
    "second , although we use only the @xmath8 constraints rather the full set of positive - mode virasoro constraints , imposing the latter should simply have the effect of reducing the degrees of freedom of the strings that we produce .",
    "a useful analogy is the computation of hawking radiation in qed ; if we work in the lorentz gauge and forget about the gupta - bleuler quantization procedure , we get the same basic physics out of the calculation , but we find that the calculated hawking flux is too large by a factor of @xmath107 , due to the effect of the unphysical timelike and longitudinal modes of the photon .",
    "a similar story should describe our calculation as well .",
    "third , although setting @xmath108 is not consistent with the full virasoro conditions , as we have seen , an examination of equation shows that this anstz is consistent with the @xmath8 constraints . finally ,",
    "although generally the concept of single particles or single strings is ambiguous in curved spacetime backgrounds , we will work with a spacetime in which string number does make sense , namely a temporarily expanding model which becomes flat minkowski space in the far past and in the far future . here",
    "we may sensibly calculate the number of strings using standard techniques and then simply multiply the number of strings in a given quantum mechanical state by the spacetime energy - momentum tensor of a string in that state , using the results described in the previous section , or some modification of them .",
    "our methods will not be directly extendible to a calculation of the quantum stress tensor in a spacetime in which the future is a singularity rather than minkowski space , but it will allow us to make some sensible statements about quantum string field theory in curved spacetime which should apply to the region we are interested in .      we wish to calculate the number of different strings produced just as we would calculate the number of particles produced : by finding the solutions to the first - quantized relativistic wave equation which are purely positive frequency in the far past and looking for the coefficients of negative - frequency components in the far future .",
    "for string theory , the ( linearized ) wave equation is just the virasoro condition : @xmath109 we wish to turn the virasoro operators into functional differential operators acting on wave functionals @xmath110 . in curved space",
    ", there are subtleties even in the case of particle wave functions due to the necessity of defining the hilbert space norms and the path integral measure in a covariant fashion ( dewitt 1957 ) ; we will assume the same story applies when we derive the string wave operator from the first - quantized path integral .",
    "the functional differential operator form of should look like @xmath111 where @xmath41 is the spacetime ricci scalar and @xmath2 depends on whether the string is conformally , or otherwise , coupled ( in other words , with what coefficient we multiply a term like @xmath112 in the first - quantized string lagrangian . )",
    "we prefer to remain agnostic as to how the string is coupled ; at any rate , in the approximations we shall look at the curvature term will be of lower order and so we will ignore it .",
    "there are several issues we must deal with before using equation as a wave operator .",
    "first , it must be normal ordered .",
    "secondly , it represents an infinite number of differential equations , one for each fourier mode of each operator . in general , these fourier modes are quite complicated ; even if @xmath113 depends only on the conformal time @xmath65 , @xmath65 is expandable in fourier modes and the metric is generally a nontrivial function .",
    "finally , it is difficult to understand and interpret the wave functional in spacetime since the spacetime time coordinate of the string depends on the worldsheet spatial coordinate , as it does in equation . with this in mind",
    "we will use only the @xmath114-independent modes of equation ( in other words , the @xmath8 and @xmath115 constraints ) , and we will set @xmath116 .    if we write the fourier expansion of our string modes as @xmath117 and use the reality constraints , we find that @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath119 so that @xmath120 .",

    "we will add a term @xmath129 to this equation in order to explicitly subtract off the zero - point energy : this will include the usual tachyon shift ( @xmath130 ) if we are working with the bosonic string .",

    "may then be written in terms of associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "if we leave the scale factor @xmath134 of the metric in explicitly , we find that @xmath135 here @xmath136 and the final line in comes from .",

    "we would like to compute the probability of particle production . as usual",
    ", we first need to define the positive frequency modes of the string field in the far past and future . the standard definition is the definition of adiabatic positive frequency modes ( see birrell and davies ( 1982 ) for an explanation and references ) : we ask that the modes we define as `` positive frequency '' be those that match exactly onto positive frequency wkb solutions in the infinite past , @xmath150 where for our spacetime @xmath151 ideally , we would find the appropriate exact wave function that matches onto this wkb solution and look for the negative frequency components in the usual manner : in lieu of this , we would like a wkb approximation for the wave function at all times .",
    "two problems arise , however .",
    "the first problem is that the negative frequency components will not be present at any order in the perturbation series one would get from plugging into .",
    "the reason is identical to the reason one does not find above - barrier reflection in semiclassical non - relativistic quantum mechanics to any perturbative order in @xmath152 .",
    "the second problem is that the terms in the equations for the coefficients @xmath153 in equation which are higher order in @xmath35 come from applying the time derivatives to @xmath154 , which depend implicitly on time through @xmath155 .",
    "the reader may easily verify that these terms are also multiplied by factors of @xmath156 and higher powers of @xmath16 , because of the recursion relations for laguerre polynomials .",
    "thus if @xmath157 , the adiabatic approximation breaks down . we will treat this case below .    in the case",
    "that the adiabatic approximation holds , there is still a trick for extracting the negative frequency part of the wave function in the far future .",
    "audretsch ( 1979 ) has pointed out , for scalar particles in curved spacetime , that the particle production calculation is almost identical to the calculation of above - barrier reflection in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , since one can generally ( for homogeneous spacetimes ) separate the time and space parts of the wave equation and write the former",
    "as @xmath158 the difference is that in above - barrier reflection , we want the incident component of the wave function to be normalized to unity and the transmitted wave function to be purely outgoing .",
    "then , if the amplitude of the transmitted wave is @xmath159 and the amplitude of the reflected wave is @xmath160 ( assuming that only one value of @xmath161 contributes to the final wave function , though the discussion may be easily generalized ) probability conservation requires that @xmath162 on the other hand , in the case of non - static spacetimes , we wish the wave function in the far past to be purely positive frequency . if this incoming wave function is normalized to unity , and the coefficients of the positive and negative frequency components of the outgoing wave function are denoted @xmath163 and @xmath7 ( again we assume that only one magnitude of the frequency contributes to the final wave function ) , probability conservation requires that @xmath164 if we write @xmath165 the analogy is obvious . in general , @xmath166 will vanish in the upper half complex @xmath20-plane at some point ( or set of points ) @xmath167 , and also at @xmath168 .",
    "the square of the reflection coefficient in the wkb approximation has been derived by pokrovskii and khalatnikov ( 1961 ) : @xmath169 in our case , if we substitute @xmath137 for @xmath166 , @xmath170 becomes the square of the bogolubov coefficient multiplying the negative frequency wkb solution in the far future ( audretsch 1979 ) .",

    "as we have seen , the time dependence of our system has the form of equation .",
    "the expression for @xmath137 in equation contains square root branch cuts in the complex @xmath20 plane ( see figure 1 ) . in order to detect the part of the wave function with negative energy",

    "if we stay far enough away from this endpoint , then the adiabatic approximation will remain valid .",

    "a little manipulation of the integral should convince the reader that the imaginary part of the integral in equation is then the correct result for the real part of the phase picked up when traveling on contour @xmath173 . since @xmath177 will be small in the adiabatic limit , the correction for the correct normalization of the wave function will be even smaller , and we may identify the expression shown in equation with @xmath178 .",
    "this discussion can be easily generalized to systems with several turning points in the complex plane ( pokrovskii and khalatnikov 1961 , landau and lifshitz 1977 , migdal 1977 , audretsch 1979 ) .",

    "the energy of each oscillator , @xmath239 , is a constant of motion , so that @xmath267 the branch of the square root changes when we reach a caustic in @xmath184 and , as stated , we must sum @xmath268 over the branches of @xmath38 . in our approximation , when @xmath269 the energy is effectively time - independent and the resulting semiclassical wave function is just the semiclassical approximation to the product of harmonic oscillator wave functions . in the `` frozen '' region , since @xmath270 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 are @xmath256 , to lowest order in our @xmath273 expansion the curve @xmath274 will remain frozen . within our approximation",
    "we may write the classical action as : @xmath275 the curvature term in the expression for @xmath137 is @xmath276 smaller than the other terms , so we shall ignore it .",
    "as we leave the frozen region , we may calculate the negative frequency component as before ( the reader may easily check that the turning point is well within the region that the `` frozen approximation '' is valid ) , and we find once again that the bogolubov coefficient is : @xmath277 which is essentially identical to the expression given in . this is independent of the position , despite the fact that @xmath278 , and the turning point in the complex @xmath65 plane , depends on @xmath160 . for more general scale factors",
    "the imaginary part of the integral around the turning point of @xmath137 will depend on @xmath160 .",
    "in addition the time integral in the `` frozen '' regime has some position dependence , so that the wave function begins at @xmath279 as a stationary state and in the `` frozen '' region begins to develop additional structure . nonetheless , within the approximation we are working in",
    ", the position dependence of @xmath280 and the perturbations of the initial wavefunction which develop as we move through the `` frozen '' region are subleading .",
    "one can see this by noting that @xmath281 thus the change in the energy arising from the change in any given oscillator coordinate will be @xmath282 for computing the integral @xmath283 , summing the squares of this error gives us a total error of @xmath244 , compared with a lowest order answer @xmath284 which is @xmath285 . in examining the perturbations to the stationary state wavefunction that accrue during the evolution through the `` frozen '' region , we can see that for a change in a single oscillator coordinate , @xmath286 while the integral @xmath287 is of @xmath244 in the @xmath228 expansion , so that corrections to our description of the wavefunction as being frozen in this regime are indeed subleading .",
    "after the string leaves the frozen region , the curve @xmath288 will generally intersect some band of energy shells of the hamiltonian describing the evolution beyond @xmath289 , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the curve @xmath290 becomes time dependent and starts to rotate and stretch with a periodicity given by that of the final oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "we still need to check that our semiclassical approximation is valid , by checking equations and .",
    "hamilton - jacobi theory tells us that @xmath291 .",
    "thus , the condition for equation to hold is that : @xmath292 this is just the usual condition for the semiclassical approximation to hold for the harmonic oscillator wavefunction ( though in the relativistic case this means @xmath293 rather than @xmath294 ) ; it will work for large energies so long as we are sufficiently far from the turning points .",
    "the energy is large and fixed for @xmath295 in our approximation ; at @xmath263 the curve @xmath288 intersects a finite band of energy shells of the final hamiltonian , all with energy larger than the initial energy if the scale factor expands ( and smaller if it contracts , though so long as the change in @xmath166 is not too drastic the final range of energies should still be large ) . for states with oscillator modes of a given energy @xmath239 , @xmath296",

    "this is the case ; if @xmath239 was small we could treat that oscillator via the adiabatic expansion .",
    "to check equation , note that @xmath297 equation holds if @xmath298 which is certainly the case .",
    "one may also work with the path integral of the wave function and check that the quadratic fluctuation operator , given by second variation of the action along the classical trajectory , contains terms of order @xmath137 , so that the saddle point integration around the classical trajectories gives a good approximation .",
    "recall also that it is the divergences in the determinant of this quadratic fluctuation operator which contribute to the @xmath7-function of the 2-d @xmath114 model ; we would thus like to reiterate that although our background does not lead to a vanishing @xmath7-function , the effects of this lack of conformal invariance will appear in the determinant of the quadratic fluctuation operator , while the physics we are interested in resides in the exponential part of the wave function , @xmath299 .    for @xmath300 ,",
    "the oscillator frequency has changed and the system now has frequency @xmath301 .",
    "it is no longer in a state of definite energy , however .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , the curve @xmath288 , which is still in our approximation identical to @xmath265 , intersects many tori defined by @xmath302 when @xmath303 and so @xmath290 will be time dependent .",
    "however , as we know that the wave function is stationary for @xmath295 within our approximation , it is easier to write the spatial part of the wave function as the product of laguerre polynomials that our semiclassical wave function approximates ; we may then simply decompose this wave function into energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian for @xmath300 .",
    "the reader has doubtless noted that this is essentially the sudden approximation for the spatial part of the wave functions .",
    "we may argue for this approximation more directly using the hartree approximation for the wave functions : that is , let @xmath304 and assume that correlations in the wave function are of higher order in @xmath228 .",
    "we may write the wave equation applied to equation @xmath305 as @xmath306 the resulting equations of motion are @xmath307 where @xmath308",
    "let us rescale @xmath309 .",
    "the first term is now @xmath310 and we shall drop it .",
    "the time dependences of @xmath223 and of the frequencies in @xmath311 have the form @xmath312 , so we have a non - relativistic harmonic oscillator which varies rapidly compared to the other time scales of the problem . in particular , @xmath313 is effectively a step function when @xmath314 , so the sudden approximation is valid .",
    "this argument is admittedly very rough but seems to capture the right physics . a string with many oscillators highly excited will be heavy and slow",
    "; therefore , it will be nonrelativistic and any change in the spacetime , if moderate , will occur on a time scale much smaller than the response time of the string .",
    "we should note that we still need the relativistic analysis above to find the string production amplitudes , as there is no string production in the nonrelativistic approximation .",
    "4evolution of one of the fourier modes of the string . for @xmath315 @xmath316",
    "is defined by the solid curve @xmath265 , which is a curve of constant energy @xmath317 in phase space .",

    "the dotted curve @xmath290 denotes the function @xmath184 found by evolving @xmath265 from @xmath257 to some @xmath65 using the string hamiltonian .",
    "we have thus shown that in this model , the number of strings per unit volume produced in a given state with energy @xmath264 is proportional to @xmath318 . at sufficiently large oscillator level @xmath238 , if the center of mass momentum is of order 1 , @xmath319 where @xmath16 is the mass .",
    "it is well known that the number of string states of mass @xmath16 , for @xmath320 , can be approximated by the formula @xmath321 where @xmath322 and @xmath323 are pure positive numbers of order 10 and depend on the specific string theory one is using .",
    "so far we have calculated the production amplitude for an arbitrary state of a given mass regardless of whether or not it was a physical state .",
    "the density of states should automatically count physical states , so if we use it to count the total number of strings produced we should get the correct answer . thus the total energy density produced during the expansion is , if we assume that our production formula holds for most string states at a given mass , @xmath324 if we allow ourselves the luxury of extrapolating our result to expansion rates of order the inverse string scale @xmath325 , we find that when @xmath326 the integral in blows up in a manner reminiscent of the hagedorn transition .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .",
    "the fact that the energy produced at a critical value of the expansion rate diverges indicates to us that computing string production on a fixed background leads to a diverging rate of string production .",
    "we believe this divergence to be a sign that we have either reached some sort of phase transition in the theory , or we have neglected the effects of the backreaction of the produced string matter .",
    "we may speculate in the latter case that since the bulk of the energy is produced in very large strings as @xmath35 approaches @xmath327 , the backreaction should act to slow the expansion , as we have previously claimed should occur with a sufficient density of strings which grow with the scale factor .",
    "since this problem will arise whenever the expansion rate is sufficiently fast , we argue that the effect of backreaction will be to sufficiently slow the expansion so that any curvature singularity , if reached , is reached at infinite proper time and that all geodesics become completeable .",
    "the arguments in the previous section are far from a rigorous solution to the problem of generic singularities , which as we have argued are very anisotropic and furthermore have no `` out '' region with an unambiguous definition of particle number . as for the latter ,",
    "we hope that the general features of our answer in terms of the more covariant concept of the energy - momentum tensor will carry through to a calculation of this quantity in a background with diverging rates of expansion and contraction , even though the details of the calculation will be very different ; in particular the essential singularity in the calculated rate of energy production seems physically well - motivated and general , being based on the fight between an exponential suppression of string production and the exponential growth of the density of states .",
    "if we wish to understand the further evolution of the spacetime , we need to understand how the anisotropic expansion and contraction which exists near generic singularities affects the configuration of produced strings , and we need to understand the equation of state in these anisotropic spacetimes . for example , one might expect that strings are preferentially produced with excitations in the most rapidly expanding and contracting directions , and that most of the strings produced will in the expanding case be large strings growing as the scale factor and in the contracting case be small strings with large momentum in the oscillator modes .",
    "the wave functions we have constructed are stationary states with no definite shape . to make our scenario plausible",
    "we would need to work with some set of coherent states which describe strings in definite classical configurations ; since the highly massive strings are generally nonrelativistic the width of the string wave function around the peak configuration will not spread too quickly .",
    "we have not been able to detect any preference in the production of any particular configuration at our level of approximation , even in the isotropically expanding case .    as for the question",
    "of which string field modes are preferentially produced , if we examine strings which are polarized in a direction or set of directions with a given expansion rate , the number of strings produced will increase with the expansion rate in that direction . on the other hand , strings with no polarization in the expanding and contracting directions ( if some spatial directions have a constant scale factor )",
    "should not be produced at all .",
    "there should be some extrapolation between these extremes , but our approximations seem to be relatively insensitive to the distribution of modes among the various polarizations .",
    "clearly there is a considerable amount of work to do .",
    "one natural scenario for the evolution of the spacetime is the following : as we approach the singularity , where it is approximated by the kasner metric , string production becomes important , and we produce unstable strings preferentially polarized in the directions which are changing the most rapidly .",
    "the equation of state for the growing strings is incompatible with a constant dilaton , so the equations governing string cosmology , equations , effectively describe the spacetime . as @xmath328 approaches the string scale , the energy becomes extremely large ; the expanding directions feel a large negative pressure and the contracting directions feel a large positive pressure , and the spacetime relaxes to a non - singular evolution .",
    "what in fact happens will depend on the correct expressions for @xmath35 and @xmath38 , the initial value of @xmath28 , and higher order corrections to the @xmath7-function equations .",
    "based on some simple computer simulations and qualitative arguments , we have found several possible outcomes for evolution via equations .",
    "there seems to be little possibility for the rapid inflation and contraction to turn around before the expansion rate reaches unity in string units .",
    "what happens when it reaches this point depends on how we interpret the diverging integral in equation .",
    "if we permit ourselves to imagine that the effect is a sufficiently large production of string matter then the expansion and contraction will suddenly reverse due to the large pressures we expect to arise from strings in rapidly expanding and contracting spacetimes . once the turnaround occurs much will depend on the equation of state for less rapidly changing spacetimes .",
    "if expansion halts completely and the pressure drops to zero , then the spacetime will stabilize at a constant scale factor but the large energy density produced will cause the dilaton to grow to infinity in finite time , so that string loop effects become extremely important .",
    "we might imagine using the conjectured duality properties of string theory ( see for example sen 1994 , hull and townsend 1995 , duff 1995 , witten 1995 ) at this point to relate the background to the weakly coupled background of another theory .",
    "another scenario occurs if the string coupling is too weak when the expansion rate becomes of order unity and not enough energy is produced ; the large continued contraction of the angular directions can cause the otherwise growing dilaton to return to weak coupling as we reach the singularity . of course , in the regime",
    "we are discussing all quantities  @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath328 , and so on  are of order one in string units ; we can only speculate what the form of the @xmath7-function equations and the equation of state might be . in discussing the form of @xmath35 and @xmath38 we should note also that at the point that the expansion becomes of order unity , the singularity in the schwarzschild geometry is reached within a single string time .",
    "it is not clear that strings can equilibrate .",
    "nonetheless , the blow - up of the integral in equation indicates that the description of the region near the putative singularity may be drastically modified by the quantum dynamics of string field theory .",
    "we have argued that in regions of rapid spatial expansion , such as the region close to a spacelike singularity , a divergent energy density of string is produced as the curvature approaches the string scale .",
    "this leads us to one of two conclusions , both of which are interesting and merit further investigation : either string theory the region close to the singularity undergoes a phase transition as the density of string approaches one string mass per string volume , or properly taking into account the back reaction of the produced strings on the spacetime pushes the singularity to infinite proper time .",
    "the answer could also be some combination of the two , or it could be that string theory is just inconsistent , although we feel that the divergence calculated has the flavor of a divergence arising from an incorrect approximation or extrapolation (  from neglecting either backreaction or a phase transition at large densities ) , and so there is no obvious reason to call this divergence a symptom of some disease of the underlying theory .",
    "if the backreaction becomes important in the manner we have suggested , it is an indication that we must take seriously unstable macroscopic strings as sources in the @xmath7-function equations .",
    "this not to say that solving the @xmath7-function equations gives us an inconsistent picture , but rather that high order loop effects become important in spacetimes with unstable strings .",
    "it would be interesting to find some sort of self - consistent way to include macroscopic strings as sources directly in the @xmath7-function equation , so that one could evolve the spacetime accordingly and see what happens to singular regions and to the singularity theorems .",
    "one might also envision trying to construct this approximation directly by resumming certain classes of loop corrections to the @xmath7-function equations .",
    "understanding how string theory modifies the dynamical equations of spacetime is extremely important for a resolution of the problem of black hole evaporation . a transition to a uniformly expanding region ( frolov  1990 ) ; continued nonsingular contraction of the two - spheres and expansion of the radial direction ( martinec 1995 ) ( where `` radial '' refers to the spacelike direction in the interior of the black hole ) ; or simultaneous collapse of the expanding directions are all possible depending on the density of state and the equations of motion of the background .",
    "the first two possibilities tell us that the information is carried away to inaccessible regions of spacetime ; the third possibility implies a slowly - evaporating - remnant scenario , where information is brought near the horizon by the recollapse of the radial scale factor .",
    "string production in a non - trivial background spacetime should be an approximation to the full quantum dynamics of the vacuum condensate",
    ". it may be that we have shown that it is incorrect not only in principle but in practice to separate dynamical quantum string fields and classical string backgrounds .",
    "if this is the case then we are stuck until we develop a manifestly background independent understanding of string field theory , or its nonperturbative completion .",

    "we would like to repeat and extend some arguments made by giddings  ( 1993 , 1994 ) concerning the worldsheet renormalization group flow of the @xmath114-model , here without the benefit of any gauge field or axion hair to stabilize the shrinking two - spheres .",
    "close to the singularity the spacetime metric should look like @xmath329 in the classical geometry we approach the singularity in finite time as the metric in the @xmath35 direction blows up , and we must go beyond the lowest order solution to the @xmath7-function equations .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath330 part of the @xmath114-model should flow to a trivial @xmath51 theory .",
    "cecotti and vafa ( 1992 ) have computed the zamolodchikov metric along the entire renormalization group flow of the supersymmetric @xmath331 model and found the metric to be well defined , even as @xmath332 becomes negative ( see also witten 1993 ) . as the radius gets small and passes through zero the theory masses up and becomes trivial , with the soliton masses increasing as @xmath333 .",
    "once the radius is sufficiently negative , the @xmath334 plane will have excess central charge ; a natural fixed point of the renormalization group flow is the @xmath6 black hole .",
    "this would mean that the velocity of the transverse stretching direction dominates the @xmath7-function for @xmath39 .",

    "this is a function of the scale factor which is of order unity at zero radius : it can not compete with the large @xmath336 terms present near a velocity - dominated singularity .",
