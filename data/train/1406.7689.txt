    "one of the important missions of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to search for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the identification of new physics signals usually requires precise understanding of standard - model background , whose contributions mainly arise from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "many theoretical approaches have been developed based on qcd , which are appropriate for studies of processes in different kinematic regions and involving different hadronic systems .",
    "the theoretical framework for high - energy hadron collisions is known as the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "i will focus on pqcd below , introducing its fundamental ingredients and applications to lhc physics .",
    "supplementary material can be found in @xcite .",
    "the simple qcd lagrangian reveals rich dynamics .",
    "it exhibits the confinement at low energy , which accounts for the existence of various hadronic bound states , such as pions , protons , @xmath1 mesons , and etc .. this nonperturbative dynamics is manifested by infrared divergences in perturbative calculations of bound - state properties like parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions . on the other hand , the asymptotic freedom at high energy leads to a small coupling constant , that allows formulation of pqcd .",
    "therefore , it is possible to test qcd in high - energy scattering , which is , however , nontrivial due to bound - state properties of involved hadrons .",
    "that is , high - energy qcd processes still involve both perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "a sophisticated theoretical framework needs to be established in order to realize the goal of pqcd : it is the factorization theorem @xcite , in which infrared divergences are factorized out of a process , and the remaining piece goes to a hard kernel .",
    "the point is to prove the universality of the infrared divergences , namely , the independence of processes the same hadron participates in .",
    "then the infrared divergences are absorbed into a parton distribution function ( pdf ) for the hadron , which just needs to be determined once , either from experimental data or by nonperturbative methods .",
    "the universality of a pdf guarantees the infrared finiteness of hard kernels for all processes involving the same hadron .",
    "convoluting these hard kernels with the determined pdf , one can make predictions .",
    "in other words , the universality of a pdf warrants the predictive power of the factorization theorem .",
    "though infrared divergences are factorized into a pdf , the associated logarithmic terms may appear in a process , that is not fully inclusive . to improve perturbative expansion ,",
    "these logarithmic corrections should be organized by evolution equations or resummation techniques .",
    "for the summation of different single logarithms , the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite and the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite have been proposed . for different double logarithms , the threshold resummation @xcite and the @xmath0 resummation @xcite have been developed .",
    "besides , an attempt has been made to combine the dglap and bfkl equations , leading to the ciafaloni - catani - fiorani - marchesini ( ccfm ) equation @xcite .",
    "similarly , the threshold and @xmath0 resummations has been unified under the joint resummation @xcite , which is applicable to processes in a wider kinematic range .",
    "a simple framework for understanding all the above evolution equations and resummation techniques will be provided .    after being equipped with the pqcd formalism , we are ready to learn its applications to various processes , for which i will introduce jet substructures and hadronic two - body heavy - quark decays .",

    "the fa encounters three principal difficulties .",
    "first , a hadronic matrix element under the fa is independent of the renormalization scale @xmath19 , as the vector or axial - vector current is partially conserved .",
