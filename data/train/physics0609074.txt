    "nonlinear laser spectroscopy provides new possibilities to create and study selectively excited states of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "development of the two - photon excitation technique @xcite made it possible to obtain small concentrations of hydrogen in the 2s metastable state .",
    "this was sufficient to carry out precise optical measurements of the hyperfine structure of 2s state @xcite and other relativistic and radiative effects @xcite .",
    "metastable atoms and atomic ions also play an important role in excitation and charge transfer processes , even in high - temperature laboratory and astrophysical plasmas @xcite .",
    "small concentrations of metastable atoms and atomic ions can significantly affect the radiative spectra of plasmas because of large cross sections of electronic capture to the excited states of highly - charged ions during collisions with the metastable atoms @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is based on theoretical and indirect spectroscopic observations .",
    "unfortunately , direct measurements are still very difficult due to the low efficiency of modern techniques for the production of beams of metastable atoms @xcite .",
    "the above examples demonstrate the importance of the development of effective methods for selective excitation of metastable atomic states .",
    "recent progress in laser techniques as well as in theoretical understanding of multiphoton processes in atoms makes it possible to introduce novel methods for effective selective excitation of atomic states by using short laser pulses .",
    "a number of approaches to control population transfer between atomic and molecular states have been proposed so far .",
    "they can be roughly divided into two groups according to the basic principles .",
    "the methods from the first group exploit some known physical mechanisms @xcite , e.g. , it is possible to introduce some _ reliable _ and _ solvable _ model equations to estimate the parameters of the controlling laser field analytically , while the methods from the second group are based on the idea of direct variation of the laser field to maximize the desired output @xcite .",
    "the schemes from the first group ultimately rely on the properties of @xmath0-pulses or on adiabatic properties .",
    "the controlling laser field is found as an accurate or approximate solution of the coupled equations within rotating wave approximation .",
    "these schemes , in turn , can be classified by the number of laser pulses involved .",
    "population inversion achieved by using a single @xmath0-pulse represents the simplest case @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the laser should be in resonance with the transition energy and the control is performed by changing the pulse area .",
    "this method can also be used to control multiphoton transitions . in that case , the frequency of the laser pulse should be a fraction of the transition energy so that the energy conservation rules are satisfied .",
    "the advantages of this scheme are that it is simple and that the intensity of the controlling laser pulse is relatively small .",
    "the main disadvantages are that the efficiency of the scheme is sensitive to the pulse area and that the resonance conditions should be satisfied accurately , especially in the case of multiphoton excitation .",
    "the schemes based on adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) rely on adiabatic properties @xcite . in this case",
    "a single chirped laser pulse is used to establish an adiabatic regime so that the complete population transfer occurs as a result of system evolution along the initially populated adiabatic state .",
    "the population transfer is not sensitive to the pulse area once an adiabatic regime is established , so the method is quite robust .",
    "however , the pulse area must be much larger than in the case of @xmath0-pulses .",
    "this becomes critical if the competing ionization or dissociation processes are significant .",
    "stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) emerged as a very efficient method to provide almost complete population transfer in a three - level system @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "the scheme involves a two - photon raman process , in which an interaction with a first ( pump ) pulse links the initial state with an intermediate state , which in turn interacts via a second ( stokes ) pulse with a final target state .",
    "an important advantage is that almost no population is placed into the intermediate state , and thus the process is insensitive to any possible decay from that state . in more complicated cases",
    "the method is used to create a maximal coherent superposition of several states @xcite and complete population transfer via several intermediate states @xcite .",
    "the analog of the stirap which relies on adiabatic properties is called chirped adiabatic passage by two - photon absorption ( capta ) @xcite .",
    "recently an effective scheme based on the idea of periodic chirping was introduced @xcite . within this scheme",
    ", a sequence of chirped laser pulses or a laser with periodic chirping is used to establish multiple crossings between dressed initial and target levels .",
    "effective laser control is performed by manipulating the parameters of these crossings and adiabatic phase differences between the two crossings directly . in its simplest formulation",
    "the complete population transfer can be achieved by using a single quadratically chirped pulse . because of interference between the crossings , the necessary pulse area of each pulse is much smaller compared to the arp ; however the method is still quite robust .",
    "these advantages make the method useful in the field of wave packet control @xcite .",
    "however , the area of the pulse is still larger than in the case of control by non - chirped pulses .",
    "the methods from the second group are based on maximization of the desired output by a step - by - step adjustment of the controlling field .",
    "the main advantage of these methods is that controlling field search is performed explicitly , so that complicated systems can be controlled .",
    "these methods can be arranged according to the measure of the controlling parameter space .    in the simplest case ,",
    "the number of controlling laser pulses and their envelopes are fixed .",
    "each pulse is described by a few parameters : peak intensity , central frequency , chirp rate , central time and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "control is performed by direct optimization of these parameters . by solving the schrdinger equation ,",
    "the final population of the desired state can be determined as a function of the parameters of the controlling pulses .",
    "well established numerical procedures for maximization of this function of many variables can be used @xcite .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that all the schemes discussed above can be reproduced by direct optimization as particular cases .",
    "the approach can be considered as an optimization with respect to a finite set of parameters , i.e. , in a multi - dimensional space .    to design the controlling field without any restrictions on its shape , the optimal control theory ( oct )",
    "was developed @xcite .",
    "it is based on the idea that the controlling laser pulse should maximize a certain functional .",
    "the basic variational procedure leads to a set of equations for the optimal laser field , which include two schrdinger equations to describe the dynamics starting from the initial and target state wave functions .",
    "the optimal laser field is given by the imaginary part of the correlation function of these two wave functions .",
    "this system of equations of optimal control must be solved iteratively in general .",
    "the reader can find a comprehensive review of oct in @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage of this method is that in many cases the generated optimal field is hardly possible to realize in an experiment .",
    "the approach can be considered as optimization with respect to a continious set of parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the functional space .    in the case of selective excitation of metastable atomic states by laser pulses ,",
    "a multiphoton interaction is the basic mechanism of the process .",
    "such effects as direct ionization @xcite , resonant transitions via intermediate discrete and continuum states @xcite , above threshold ionization @xcite , and electron rescattering by the atomic core @xcite are essential .",
    "an accurate treatment of all these effects requires the exact solution of the quantum equations to describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to introduce some _ reliable _ and _ solvable _ model equations to estimate the parameters of the controlling laser field analytically .",
    "thus , the methods of maximization of desired output should be used .    in the present work selective excitations of the metastable 2s state of hydrogen and the singlet metastable 1s2s @xmath1s state of helium",
    "are studied using both the direct optimization of laser parameters and the optimal control theory . to integrate the time - dependent schrdinger equation ,",
    "the well established close - coupling approach based on the properties of time - dependent integral equations @xcite is used .",
    "this approach is the most suitable for this kind of spectroscopic calculation .",
    "as electron - atom collisions rapidly destroy atomic metastable states , a search of the optimal laser parameters is performed under the requirement that not only high final population of desired metastable state should be achieved , but also ionization probability should be small @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the theoretical approaches are summarized , and relations between the results of the optimal control calculations and the recently known schemes are demonstrated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : femto ] direct optimization of the parameters of one- and two laser pulses with gaussian envelope is used to introduce a number of simple schemes for selective excitation of h(2s ) and he(1s2s @xmath1s ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : atto ] the optimal control theory is used to look for other possible controlling laser fields .",
    "a new mechanism of selective excitation by using attosecond pulses is introduced .",
    "[ sec : concl ] contains a summary .",

    "atomic units are used throughout the paper , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we employ the close - coupling ( cc ) method on the basis of the orthogonal and normalized unperturbed atomic wave functions of the discrete and continuum states and expand the total wavefunction as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the indices that represent the integer quantum numbers of discrete and continuum states respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the corresponding stationary state wavefunctions , @xmath11 are the energies of the discrete states , @xmath12 stands for the energy of the electron continuum and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are unknown coefficients .",
    "the hermitian system of coupled equations for the coefficients of the discrete and continuum states follows from substituting the expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq : expan ] ) into the time - dependent schrdinger equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : schr_eq ] ) as @xmath15 @xmath16 the matrix elements",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are integrals over @xmath20-space taken with the atomic dipole moment operator .",
    "the first and the second sums in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cce1 ] ) describe the bound - bound and free - bound transitions , respectively .",
    "these transitions result in a significant redistribution of the population of discrete states .",
    "this in turn strongly affects the ionization process @xcite .",
    "the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cce2 ] ) describes ionization from all the discrete states and the integral term ( free - free transitions ) describes a multiphoton inverse bremsstrahlung process ( within quantum mechanical considerations ) or rescattering processes ( within quasiclassical considerations ) .",
    "these processes play an important role in formation of the photoelectronic spectra at high energies @xcite .",
    "however , since the free - free matrix elements practically do not affect the discrete state amplitudes @xmath21 , it is possible to neglect them for the evaluation of @xmath21 .",
    "the transitions neglected in this approximation are the third - order ( bound - free - free - bound ) ones .",
    "the role of the free - free transitions was carefully investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , and this assumption was confirmed to work well .",
    "the close - coupling equations eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cce1]-[eq : cce2 ] ) with the free - free transitions neglected can be solved by discretizing the continuum or by employing the recently developed approach based on the properties of the time - dependent integral equations without any discretization of the continuum @xcite .",
    "as the nonresonant interaction between the lower and highly excited discrete states is small , it is possible to adjust the number of discrete states involved in expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq : expan ] ) so that the results of the calculations do not change .",
    "although , strictly speaking , this procedure does not prove the convergence of the close - coupling approach , it is still widely used in collisional physics @xcite .    in the present study we consider excitation and ionization of a single atomic electron in the field of linearly polarized laser pulses .",

    "one can determine the final population of a selected state as a function of these parameters . to find the maximum of this function",
    ", the conjugate gradient search method @xcite is used here .",
    "the gradient of the final population of the target state with respect to the laser parameters is calculated numerically using the finite - difference approximation .",
    "the optimization starts from some initial guess parameters .",
    "as different laser pulse parameters have different dimensions , the parameters should be put on a common ground by using dimensionless units , or the optimizations with respect to different types of parameters should be performed separately . in the first case",
    "the convergence of the optimization procedure could depend on the dimensionless units used .",
    "indeed , the efficiency of the selective excitation by non - chirped pulse strongly depends on whether or not the resonant conditions are achieved , so that by using common atomic units one should find the maximum of the function that strongly depends on one group of arguments ( frequencies ) and only weakly on the other arguments ( intensities , durations etc . ) .",
    "this example demonstrates that proper dimensionless units should be used to ensure reasonable convergence .",
    "moreover , the derived optimal parameters could depend on how that units are defined .    in the present study",
    "the optimizations with respect to different types of parameters are performed separately so that each step of the optimization procedure should contain a set of optimizations with respect to the parameters for all pulses that have the same dimension .",
    "generally , some laser parameters should be linked with each other to achieve a maximum of the desired output .",
    "if the chirping rate is zero , the optimal intensity and duration of each pulse are related to each other by some pulse area conservation rule . to avoid this uncertainty",
    ", we assume the durations of the pulses to be equal .",
    "after the optimal parameters of the controlling sequence of laser pulses are found , we can adjust intensities and durations to fit the specifics of the experimental technique .",
    "the order of optimizations performed at each step of the direct search affects the efficiency , convergence and resulting controlling scheme .",
    "however , since the laser field , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss_pulses ] ) , has only five different types of parameters , the number of possible nonequivalent orders of optimization is limited .",
    "table [ tab : table1 ] presents the correspondence between the controlling schemes generated by the direct optimization method with different orders of optimizations performed at each step and previously known schemes .",
    "since the last schemes have been established without bound - free transitions taken into account the continuum states are not included in the test calculations of table [ tab : table1 ] .",
