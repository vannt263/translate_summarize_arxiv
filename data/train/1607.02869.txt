    "despite the fact that dsrs suffer from the lack of a consistent and well - established mathematical structure similar to what exists for sr , @xmath0-minkowski spacetime and @xmath0-poincar are likely the richest frameworks which can be assigned to dsrs , at least so far .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , we just adopt the dsr interpretation proposed in magueijo - smolin model @xcite as one of the conceivable phenomenological frameworks of @xmath0-minkowski spacetime . as an interesting and promising feature of the mentioned framework",
    ", it can be used to explain astrophysical data received from grbs ( note that gamma - ray bursts ( gbrs ) along with supernovae , neutron stars and black holes are four main pillars of relativistic astrophysics ) @xcite .    with these preliminaries and in the context of some prevalent phenomenological issues through combination of the modified mass shell condition ( [ e1-a ] ) and @xmath0-deformed lorentz transformations ( [ e1-b ] ) and ( [ e1-c ] ) , we examine and derive some phenomenological consequences of a @xmath0-minkowski relativistic model .",
    "specifically , we treat the elastic scattering problem with the planck energy cutoff by focusing on some relativistic kinematical properties of this scattering problem .",
    "we are looking for the mentioned objectives in these steps : in section 2 we study the effects of the planck energy upper bound , @xmath0 , on the elastic scattering process where no new particles are created during the process .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the investigation of the _ rapidity _ as one of the most important kinematical variables involving in the heavy ion collisions in the presence of the @xmath0 deformation of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the paper follows with a conclusion along with a brief remark in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the elastic scattering processes where no new particles are created during the process in a @xmath0-deformed minkowski space - time . to this end",
    ", we firstly present an explicit relation for @xmath0-deformed energy and momentum .",
    "suppose a clock that is fixed at the position @xmath39 of a rest frame , @xmath40 .",
    "if the clock emits signals in a regular time interval @xmath41 , then according to the modified lorentz transformations ( [ e1-b ] ) , an observer located in the moving system @xmath42 , measures this time interval as follows @xmath43\\;.\\ ] ] since the clock is fixed at the system @xmath40 , then @xmath44 , which gives @xmath45 this equation can be rewritten in terms of the proper time @xmath46 as @xmath47 in this framework we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the classical velocity and @xmath17 marks the rest mass .",
    "now , inserting the @xmath0-deformed relativistic momentum ( [ e2 - 3 ] ) into the modified dispersion relation ( [ e1-a ] ) , we derive the following equation @xmath50=0\\;.\\ ] ] solving this equation we find @xmath51\\right]^{1/2}}{2 \\left(1-\\frac{m^{2}c^{4}}{\\kappa^{2}}\\right)}\\;.\\ ] ] the positive sign in this solution is acceptable since for the case with @xmath52 and @xmath53 , naturally the @xmath0-deformed energy ( [ e2 - 5 ] ) should reduce to the relativistic result @xmath54 . by applying the approximation @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( [ e2 - 5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath56 where @xmath57}\\;,\\ ] ] is a dimensionless running constant .",
    "note that @xmath58 . in order to study the classical collision process",
    ", the center of mass ( cm ) coordinate system is an appropriate tools to derive many of kinematic relations , while in the relativistic framework it is meaningless to speak about the cm system . in sr theory ,",
    "mass and energy are related so that it is common in sr kinematics that one uses a center of momentum coordinate system instead of the cm . of course , in the center of momentum coordinate as cm , the total linear momentum of the system is zero . in the context of the relativistic collision ,",
    "the laboratory coordinate system is related to the inertial system @xmath40 and the center of momentum system @xmath42 ( the moving system ) via a lorentz transformation . in dsr framework",
    "we follow the standard procedure with the difference that laboratory system @xmath40 and the moving system @xmath42 are related now by the @xmath0-deformed lorentz transformations .",
    "so , if a particle of rest mass @xmath59 which moves in one dimension collides elastically with a particle of the rest mass @xmath60 , then in the center of momentum system , we have denote the magnitude of the 3-momentum of particles @xmath61 in the cm system so that @xmath62 . an observer located in the cm",
    "frame sees these two particles are moving towards each other so that depending on the direction , one has @xmath63 or @xmath64 . ]",
    "@xmath65 at the first glance this equality seems to be misleading .",
    "it is obvious that from the deformed lorentz transformations one naturally gets the deformed dispersion relation ( [ e1-a ] ) ( since this transformation keeps ( [ e1-a ] ) invariant ) .",
    "therefore , one has also the deformed conservation of energy - momentum so that this relation then governs on the nature of how particles behave in collisions .",
    "more precisely , one expects that in the standard momentum conservation law ( [ e2 - 8 ] ) , @xmath0-deformation must be regarded . while this is sensible in essence , as we show equation ( [ e2 - 8 ] ) is still valid up to the first order correction . + by using the relation @xmath66 , the space components of the momentum 4-vector in ( [ e2 - 8 ] ) can be written as @xmath67 since @xmath68 ,   @xmath69 and also @xmath70 . according to the deformed lorentz transformation ( [ e1-c ] ) and using ( [ e2 - 6 ] ) ,",
    "the transformation of the momentum @xmath71 ( from @xmath40 to @xmath42 ) is written as @xmath72 finally by replacing this relation into the left hand side of relation ( [ e2 - 8 * ] ) , we arrive at the following relation @xmath73 where this relation can be solved for @xmath74 and @xmath75 in terms of @xmath76 to find @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the absence of the @xmath0 deformation of the minkowski space - time background i.e. for @xmath29 , then @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "so , the above equations reduce to the flowing special relativistic counterparts @xmath81 and @xmath82 now we write the transformation equations for momentum components between the moving system @xmath42 and the laboratory system @xmath40 after the scattering .",
    "it is obvious that after scattering we have both @xmath83 and @xmath84 components of the momentum .",
    "the @xmath83 and @xmath84 components of the momentum after scattering in the laboratory system @xmath40 read as follows @xmath85 and @xmath86 by introducing the angle of scattering @xmath87 in the laboratory frame and by dividing ( [ e2 - 15 ] ) with ( [ e2 - 14 ] ) , we get @xmath88 where by inserting @xmath89 , it takes the following form @xmath90 by the same procedure , for the recoiled particle we find respectively @xmath91 and @xmath92 introducing an angle of scattering @xmath93 in the laboratory frame for the recoiled particle and then by dividing ( [ e2 - 19 ] ) with ( [ e2 - 18 ] ) , we find @xmath94 for the special case with @xmath95 , i.e. with @xmath96 we find @xmath97 therefore , for the case @xmath95 , the angles @xmath87 and @xmath93 take the following forms respectively @xmath98 and @xmath99 so , the angle between the directions of the scattered and recoiled particles is given by @xmath100 . through the relation @xmath101",

    "( [ e2 - 24 ] ) recovers its relativistic counterpart as @xmath105 therefore , one finds that in the @xmath0-deformed non - commutative geometry , the maximum amount of the included angle @xmath103 is dependent on the two dimensionless parameters @xmath76 and @xmath106 . in order to have a qualitative understanding of eq .",
    "( [ e2 - 24 ] ) , we plot variation of @xmath107 in terms of @xmath76 in figure 1 .",
    "if we set the @xmath106 to be a running constant , this figure gives a qualitative description of the situation .",
    "for any given value of @xmath76 , by increasing the value of @xmath106 the maximum included scattering angle @xmath107 increases .",
    "so , we can say that correction of @xmath106 due to the @xmath0-deformed minkowski spacetime results in a shift of the maximum included scattering angle @xmath107 .        in what follows , to see another prediction of the setup , we assume that the recoil angle @xmath93 is negligible",
    ". then we track the effect of @xmath0 modification on the kinetic energy @xmath108 of the scattered particle 1 by the target particle 2 .",
    "using the inverse @xmath0-modified lorentz transformation ( [ e1-c ] ) , we have @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 represent the total energy of particle 1 after collision in the laboratory and center of momentum frames , respectively . by substituting @xmath112 and @xmath113 into eq .",

    "one can see  classical mechanics \" text book such as ref .",
    "if @xmath127 then @xmath128 , namely , no collision takes place since the speed remains constant before and after the collision and no momentum is transferred to particle-2 .",
    "however , if @xmath129 then @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) and particle-2 is forwardly scattered with the same kinetic energy before owned by particle-1 . ]",
    "( that is , @xmath132 , in eqs . ( [ e2 - 29 ] ) and ( [ e2 - 33 ] ) ) , for the case @xmath127 we have @xmath133 . here , we are confronted with an unusual status in which as soon as we turn on @xmath0-spacetime deformation , the nature of two - body collision alters from elastic to inelastic one .",
    "it is important to stress that the overall behavior of the curves in figure 2 are independent of the values of the dimensionless relativistic parameter @xmath134 .",
    "+ at this point a question arises whether it is possible to remove these unusual phenomenological effects via @xmath0 deformation of the momentum conservation law ( [ e2 - 8 ] ) .",
    "to check this situation , inspired by @xcite we modify eq .",
    "( [ e2 - 8 ] ) as follows @xmath135 let s focus carefully on this modified momentum conservation law in the cm system .",
    "since in the adopted dsr proposal ( the ms proposal ) one has the spacetime translational invariance , the energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "however , dsr proposals are non - linear in essence .",
    "this means that 4-momentum of a system of two particles is not just a linear summation of two particles momentums . as a consequence , in passing from sr to dsr , i.e. from linear to non - linear relativity",
    ", the additivity of energy and momentum is replaced with non - additivity character . for more insight on this issue",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . now",
    "the modified relation ( [ e2 - 34 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath136 where @xmath137 . up to the first order of the modification ( i.e. @xmath138 ) ,",
    "the second and third terms on the right hand side of this relation can be neglected .",
    "this means that , up to the first order correction , momentum conservation law ( [ e2 - 8 ] ) is still valid and consequently the obtained unusual outcomes are direct consequences arising from extended phenomenological framework at hand .",
    "+ as the final remark in this section , we note that the apparent energy non - conservation appeared above has been conjectured in nc manifolds and could be due to a discrete ( underlying ) time evolution @xcite .",
    "so , noether s theorem should be correspondingly reformulated for the case of nc spacetime translations .",
    "in this section we firstly present an important kinematical variable , the rapidity , that relates the momentum of the particle to the dynamics of a heavy - ion reaction .",
    "there is the possibility of creation of several particles after collision .",
    "the momentum of each particle can be decomposed into a longitudinal component @xmath139 and a transverse component @xmath140 with reference to the collision axis .",
    "the longitudinal momentum of a particle , due to its dependence on the velocity of the cm frame with respect to the laboratory frame , is not so conventional variable in literature . besides , in order to analyze some experimental outputs , it is essential to be able to view them from the cm frame s perspective .",
    "as has been mentioned previously , we use the word `` cm frame '' for center of momentum frame in this context . by introducing a kinematical variable as the rapidity @xmath84 , one is able simply to choose or change the reference frame .",
    "this is arising from the fact that unlike the velocity , the variable @xmath84 is defined in special relativity to be additive under a sequence of the lorentz transformations along the same direction . in",
    "what follows , we answer the question whether the variable @xmath84 still remains additive under successive @xmath0-deformed lorentz transformations ( [ e1-c ] ) . in three dimensional space , modified on shell condition ( [ e1-a ] ) , can be rewritten as follows @xmath141 so that @xmath142 is known as transverse mass . by writing eq .",
    "( [ e3 - 1 ] ) as @xmath143 , then the variable @xmath84 can be defined in terms of the energy and momentum as follows @xmath144 therefore , for a @xmath0-deformed special relativity scenario with dispersion relation as eq .",
    "( [ e1-a ] ) , one finds that the rapidity / energy - momentum relation reads as eq .",
    "( [ e3 - 3 ] ) which is similar to its relativistic counterpart .",
    "so , the relation between velocity and rapidity now is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e3 - 3 ] ) as @xmath145 this relation gives the rapidity @xmath84 as follows @xmath146 since @xmath147 to investigate the additivity of rapidity under a sequence of the @xmath0-deformed lorentz transformations , we consider the transformation of the momentum vector under a change of the reference frame along the collision axis .",
    "it is obvious that under such a transformations , @xmath140 and @xmath148 are unchanged .",
    "therefore , under a @xmath0-deformed lorentz transformation , the energy and longitudinal component of the momentum transform as @xmath149 note that here a prime marks the quantities that are measured by an observer in the laboratory system which moves with the velocity @xmath150 with respect to the cm frame of reference in which the energy @xmath15 and momentum @xmath139 are measured .",
    "putting eq .",
    "( [ e3 - 1 ] ) along with @xmath151 and @xmath152 derived from eq .",
    "( [ e3 - 4 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e3 - 7 ] ) , we get @xmath153 therefore , the rapidity @xmath154 as seen in the laboratory frame can be read as follows @xmath155 while this relation reflects the fact that rapidity is not an additive quantity under a sequence of the @xmath0-deformed lorentz transformations , for the case @xmath79 ( that is , under standard lorentz transformations ) this relation restores the additivity property , i.e , @xmath156 . therefore , in passing from the standard sr to @xmath0-deformed sr , one loses the additivity nature of rapidity .",
    "this is much similar to losing additivity rule of speeds in passing from galilean relativity to special relativity .",
    "note that relation ( [ e3 - 9 ] ) is a direct result of the nonlinear representation of lorentz transformations .",
    "technically , as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magueijo - smolin proposal of dsr can be realized via deformed translation invariance without need to deformation of the ls ( this is also the case for all other proposals of dsr , see @xcite ) . the @xmath0-minkowski spacetime modified translation generator in the ms model of dsr",
    "is given by @xmath157 . in this respect ,",
    "the origin of deviations from sr observed in this paper comes back to the deformed translation invariance since this really controls how momentum of particles behaves in collisions .",
    "noncommutative geometry ( spacetime ) is undoubtedly one of the richest framework among other alternatives to pursue physics at the planck scale . in this paper , we were concerned on a particular form of noncommutative spacetimes which highly takes care of lorentz symmetry and known as @xmath0-minkowski spacetime .",
    "the noncommutative parameter @xmath0 can be conceived as quantum gravity scale where high energy physics is trying to unravel its mysteries .",
    "the mentioned noncommutative parameter is observer independent which leads to a natural connection between @xmath0-minkowski spacetime and doubly special relativity theories ( dsrs ) .",
    "therefore , noncommutative geometry parameter @xmath0 is responsible for cutoff energy scale featured in dsr theories @xcite as the seconded invariant . in the new framework ,",
    "we are faced with dsr formalism as a nonlinear @xmath0 extension of the lorentz transformations and dispersion relations of special relativity . in this work , through focusing on the magueijo - smolin version of dsr theories @xcite , we have investigated how such energy upper bound will affect some relativistic kinematical parameters in a typical collision of particles . as a first step , by applying @xmath0-deformed lorentz transformations ( [ e1-b ] ) , ( [ e1-c ] ) along with modified mass shell condition ( [ e1-a ] ) , we have investigated the effect of the planck energy cutoff on the elastic scattering processes for the case that no new particles are produced in the process .",
    "we have shown ( as figure 1 indicates ) that the existence of @xmath106-term caused by the @xmath0-minkowski spacetime , leads increment of maximum included scattering angle @xmath107 relative to the standard case . while the classical and special relativistic kinematics indicate that the maximum included scattering angle is bounded as @xmath158 , the @xmath0-deformed nonlinear extension of special relativity violates this bound since for angles larger than @xmath159 , there is probability of detection of scattered particles . in the same way , by assuming that the recoil angle @xmath93 is negligible , we have treated the effect of the planck energy upper bound ( @xmath0 modification ) on the kinetic energy @xmath108 of the scattered particle .",
    "surprisingly , in contrast to classical mechanics and even special theory of relativity , we have observed that for the case @xmath127 and @xmath160 , @xmath133 as figure 2 shows .",
    "considering the fact that for the case @xmath79 one recovers the standard result @xmath161 , in the context of the @xmath0 deformed extension of the special relativity one tempts to think that spacetime seems to have some sort of dissipative effects at quantum gravity scale .",
    "the apparent energy non - conservation appeared in our context could be due to a discrete ( underlying ) time evolution as shown in ref .",
    "it is also expected that the noether s theorem must be correspondingly reformulated in the present case of nc spacetime translations . as an important result",
    ", we have shown that unlike the special relativity , rapidity in @xmath0-minkowski spacetime is no longer an additive quantity under a sequence of @xmath0-deformed lorentz transformations .",
    "this is reminiscent of the fact that one loses the additive nature of speeds in passing from galilean relativity to special relativity .",
    "we note that the observed deviations from sr in this paper originate from the deformed translation invariance , not necessarily to the deformed ls .",
    "in fact , this deformed translation invariance is that controls how momentum of particles behaves in collisions .",
    "the outputs of our study support the idea that the main feature of dsr theories is the deformed translation symmetry , not the deformed ls as has been discussed also in @xcite .    finally , about the algebraic structure of @xmath0-minkowski spacetime if we look at the full algebra generated by boosts , rotations and translations , then the algebra is really the lorentz algebra .",
    "depending on the choice of realization , even the translation part can be un - deformed and therefore having the full poincar algebra .",
    "but this is only on the algebra level , that is what governs the one particle representations .",
    "however the coalgebraic sector is deformed , leading to nontrivial multi - particle states , which are the ones appearing in collisions .",
    "the @xmath0-minkowski algebra is compatible with deformed poincare algebra , usually @xmath0-poncar algebra ( but one can also go beyond this in general to deformations of igl - hopf algebra ) for which we have that the lorentz sector is intact , but depending on realization the translation part is deformed . only in the classical basis ( or natural realization ) the translation part is also intact . anyway , for any realization ( natural , bicrossproduct etc ) the coalgebraic sector is deformed , meaning that the coproduct of boosts , rotation and translation is not primitive , and this gives some new interesting phenomenon for the multiparticle states , and therefore collisions @xcite . + * acknowledgement * + we are indebted to two anonymous referees for detailed and very insightful comments .",

    "<S> the doubly special relativity ( dsr ) theories are suggested in order to incorporate an observer - independent length scale in special theory of relativity . </S>",
    "<S> the magueijo - smolin proposal of dsr is realizable through a particular form of the noncommutative ( nc ) spacetime ( known as @xmath0-minkowski spacetime ) in which the lorentz symmetry is preserved . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> , the nc parameter @xmath0 provides the origin of natural cutoff energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> using a nonlinear deformed relativistic dispersion relation along with the lorentz transformations , we investigate some phenomenological facets of two - body collision problem ( without creation of new particles ) in a @xmath0-minkowski spacetime . by treating an elastic scattering problem , we study effects of the planck scale energy cutoff on some relativistic kinematical properties of this scattering problem . </S>",
    "<S> the results are challenging in the sense that as soon as one turns on the @xmath0-spacetime extension , the nature of the two - body collision alters from elastic to inelastic one . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown also that a significant kinematical variable involving in heavy ion collisions , the rapidity , is not essentially an additive quantity under a sequence of the nonlinear representation of the lorentz transformations . </S>",
