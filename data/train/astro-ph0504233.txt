    "that the temperature is constant and gas density follows a @xmath14-model , lead to large biases in the mass determination @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to have direct measurements of the icm density and temperature distributions at large radii . long - exposure _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations now provide such measurements for samples of low - redshift clusters @xcite , and the resulting @xmath2 relations are in very good agreement with the state - of - the - art cosmological simulations @xcite .",
