    "it is easy to see that the @xmath45 is gauge equivalent to @xmath46 and @xmath47 is gauge equivalent to @xmath48 , so we can restrict @xmath45 and @xmath47 in the region @xmath49 $ ] .",

    "the different phases across the tqpt are characterized by different topologies of fermi surface @xcite instead of being classified by different symmetries , so they are beyond landau s paradigm .",
    "based on the physical pictures shown in the fig .  2",
    ", we will derive the effective action near the tqcp at @xmath76 by the following procedures : ( 1 ) perform an expansion around the critical point @xmath77 and the merging point @xmath78 ( or equivalently @xmath79 ) : @xmath80 where the @xmath81 and the @xmath82 . ( 2 )",

    "note that the eq .   and",
    "eq .   were derived at a fixed gauge , namely along the dashed line in fig .",
    "1(b ) , so the position of the merging point @xmath85 ( or @xmath79 ) will change under a gauge transformation .",
    "this fact will play very important roles in the experimental detections of the tqpt and will be discussed in details in the last section .    applying the same procedures to the four @xmath108 points in the fig .  2",
    ", we obtain the usual dirac - type hamiltonian for these points .",
    "these four dirac points stay non - critical through the tqpt , so they just contribute to a smooth background across the tqpt . in the following ,",
    "we subtract the trivial contributions from the @xmath62 `` spectator '' fermions from all the physical quantities .",
    "all the physical quantities should be multiplied by a factor of 2 to take into account the two merging points @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "now we investigate if there are any singular behaviors of the ground state energy across the tqpt .",

    "indeed , the @xmath119 exhibits a cusplike behavior near @xmath127 in fig .",
    "numerically , we obtain the critical exponent @xmath128 and @xmath129 consistent with our analytical results eq .",
    "( note that @xmath130 ) .",
    "this fact confirms that the effective hamiltonian eq .   indeed captures the low energy fluctuations across the tqpt .      at finite temperature @xmath131 ,",

    "it turns out all the singular behaviors are encoded in @xmath134 .",
    "there is no more singularities at any finite temperature , so the tqpt becomes a crossover at any finite @xmath131 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can sketch the finite temperature phase diagram in the fig .",
    "we can write down the scaling forms of the retarded single particle green function , the dynamical compressibility and the specific heat @xmath135 where the subscript @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) stands for the @xmath102 ( @xmath101 ) phase .",

    "( see method section ) , we find the scaling dimension of @xmath16 is @xmath149 , so it is irrelevant near the tqpt at @xmath150 .",
    "it was known @xcite that the @xmath16 , with the scaling dimension @xmath151 , is also irrelevant near the dirac points at @xmath108 .",
    "so all the leading scaling behaviors will not be changed by the weak short - range interaction . for the quenched disorders @xmath152 in the gauge parameters",
    "@xmath153 , following the rg procedures in @xcite , we find its scaling dimension is @xmath154 , so they are relevant to the tqpt at @xmath150 .",
    "it was known @xcite that the @xmath155 , with the scaling dimension @xmath156 , is marginal near the dirac points at @xmath108 .",
    "this put some constraints on the stabilities of the laser beams generating the synthetic gauge field .",
    "it would be interesting to look at the interplays between the strong repulsive or negative @xmath16 and the non - abelian gauge potentials near the tqpt .      due to absence of symmetry breaking across a tqpt , it remains experimentally challenging to detect a tqpt .",
    "very recently , the esslinger s group in eth @xcite has manipulated two time - reversal related dirac points @xcite in the band structure of the ultracold fermi gas of @xmath157k atoms by tuning the hopping anisotropies in a honeycomb optical lattice and identified the two dirac zero modes via the momentum resolved interband transitions ( mrit ) . as to be stressed in the disscussion section , in the present synthetic gauge potential problem , the positions of the dirac points and the two merging points @xmath158 shown in fig .",
    "2 are gauge - dependent , so can be shifted by a gauge transformation .",
    "we expect that by tuning the orientations and intensity profiles of the incident laser beams , various gauges corresponding to the same wilson loops @xmath36 and @xmath32 can be experimentally generated .",
    "so the mrit measurement can still be used to detect the positions of the two merging points , the dirac points and the tqpt at a fixed gauge",
    ". then it can be repeatedly performed at various other experimentally chosen gauges to monitor the changes of these positions as the gauge changes .",
    "however , the number of dirac points @xmath159 in the two different topological phases and the density of states @xmath160 are gauge invariant . in principle , the number of dirac points @xmath161 can be measured by hall conductivities .",
    "the @xmath160 can be measured by the modified rf - spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "there are previous experimental measurements on the specific heat of a strongly interacting fermi gas @xcite .",
    "very recently , ku _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite observed the superfluid phase transition in a strongly interacting @xmath162li fermi gas by presenting precise measurements of the compressibility @xmath163 and the heat capacity @xmath164 .",
    "it was demonstrated that the presence of the optical lattice does not present technical difficulties in the compressibility measurements @xcite , therefore these measurements @xcite can be used to detect the uniform compressibility eq .  , the specific heat eq .   and the wilson ratio in eq .  .",
    "the various kinds of light and atom scattering methods discussed in @xcite is particularly suitable to detect the dynamic compressibility in eq .  .",
    "in this work , we investigate the topological quantum phase transition ( tqpt ) of fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice in the presence of a synthetic non - abelian gauge potential . the two abelian phases @xmath38 are connected by the tqpt tuned by the non - abelian gauge parameters .",
    "we especially distinguish between gauge invariant and gauge dependent quantities across the tqpt .",
    "in fact , the `` abelian path '' discussed in @xcite is just equivalent to the abelian point @xmath165 in fig.1b .",
    "the positions of the dirac cones along the `` abelian path '' shown in the fig .  7 in @xcite are gauge dependent quantities and can be shifted by gauge transformations , but the ground state energy @xmath166 is gauge invariant . in the tqpt in an anisotropic honeycomb lattice studied in @xcite , there is no synthetic gauge potential , the collision is between two time - reversal related dirac points , so the merging points can only be located at half of a reciprocal lattice . here",
    ", the collision shown in fig.2 is _ not _ between two time - reversal related dirac points .",
    "the locations of the two merging points @xmath158 and the four dirac points @xmath167 are gauge dependent . but the total number of dirac points @xmath60 , the colliding process and the tqpt shown in fig.2 are gauge invariant . in the 3 dimensional tqpt driven by a zeeman field discussed in @xcite",
    ", there is no synthetic gauge potential either , the time - reversal symmetry is broken by the zeeman field , the collision is between one left handed and one right - handed weyl fermions at 3d . at the bcs mean field level ,",
    "the critical effective field theory is a 4-component dirac fermion at 3d which is different from eqn.[eq : aheff ] .",
    "so it is a different class of tqpt than that discussed in this paper .",
    "as stressed in this work , in principle , the cold atom experiments @xcite can generate various gauges corresponding to the same @xmath36 and @xmath32 , so both gauge invariant and gauge dependent quantities can be detected in such experiments . in sharp contrast , only gauge - invariant quantities can be detected in condensed matter experiments ( for the discussions on gauge invariant green functions in high temperature superconductors , see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the cold atom experiments of generating synthetic gauge potentials on an optical lattice can lead to new types of tqpt and also offer new opportunities to explore both gauge invariant and non - gauge invariant quantities through the tqpt .",
