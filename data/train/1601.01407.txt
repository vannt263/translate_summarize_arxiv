    "there is a correspondence between gamma - ray emission and the snr . * the gamma - ray emission around hb 3",
    "is extended , located off the galactic plane and far from the galactic center , so the probability of chance superposition of other galactic sources is small .",
    "also , the spectral shape of gamma rays around hb  3 is similar to other gamma - ray sources associated with old snrs , i.e. a soft spectrum with a spectral break at energies of around 110  gev  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these facts suggest the association between the gamma - ray emission and hb  3 . * assuming this , enhancement of gamma - ray emission from w3 , which contains the molecular clouds traced by co line emission , can be reasonably explained by interaction between high - energy particles and the dense material in the clouds .",
    "thus we argue that the bulk of gamma - ray emission comes from interactions of high - energy particles accelerated at the shocks of hb  3 with interstellar matter or fields in the regions .",
    "first , we discuss the gamma - ray spectrum of the snr which was obtained by using the disk spatial template . to model the broadband emission from the entire snr we adopt the simplest possible assumption that gamma rays are emitted by a population of accelerated protons and electrons distributed in the same region and characterized by constant matter density and magnetic field strength .",
    "we assume the injected electrons to have the same momentum distribution as protons .",
    "this assumption requires a break in the momentum spectrum because the spectral index in the radio domain , corresponding to lower particle momenta , is much harder than for gamma rays , which correspond to higher particle momenta .",
    "therefore , we use the following functional form to model the momentum distribution of injected particles : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the break momentum , @xmath35 is the spectral index below the break and @xmath36 above the break .",
    "note that here we consider a minimum momenta of 100  mev  @xmath37 since the details of the proton / electron injection process are poorly known .",
    "electrons suffer energy losses due to ionization , coulomb scattering , bremsstrahlung , synchrotron emission and inverse compton  ( ic ) scattering .",
    "we calculated the evolution of the electron momenta spectrum by the following equation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the momentum loss rate , and @xmath40 is the particle injection rate .",
    "we assume @xmath40 to be constant , i.e. , that the shock produces a constant number of particles until the snr enters the radiative phase , at which time the source turns off .",
    "this prescription approximates the weakening of the shock and the reduction in the particle acceleration efficiency , which would be properly treated by using a time - dependent shock compression ratio  @xcite . to derive the remnant emission spectrum we calculated @xmath41 numerically , where @xmath42 is the snr age assumed to be @xmath8  yr .",
    "note that we neglected the momentum losses for protons since the timescale of neutral pion production is @xmath7  10@xmath43  yr where @xmath44 is the gas density averaged over the entire snr shell and is much longer than the snr age .",
    "also we neglect the gamma - ray emission by secondary positrons and electrons from charged pion decay , because the emission from secondaries is generally faint compared to that from primary electrons unless the gas density is as high as that in dense molecular clouds and the snr evolution reaches the later stages , or the injected electron - to - proton ratio is much lower than locally observed .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum from @xmath45 decay produced by the interactions of protons with ambient hydrogen is calculated based on @xcite using a scaling factor of 1.68 to account for helium and heavier nuclei in target material and cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "contributions from bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering by accelerated electrons are computed based on @xcite , whereas synchrotron radiation is based on @xcite .",
    "first , we consider a @xmath45-decay dominated model .",
    "the number index of protons in the high - energy regime is constrained to be @xmath46 from the gamma - ray spectral slope .",
    "@xmath47 by modeling the radio spectrum as synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons ( under the assumption that protons and electrons have identical injection spectra ) .",
    "the spectral index @xmath48 of the radio continuum emission is @xmath7  0.34  @xcite , where @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the flux density and the frequency , respectively .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum provides an upper bound for the momentum break at @xmath7   13  gev  @xmath37 .",
    "we adopt a break at the best - fit value , 10  gev  @xmath37 .",
    "the gas density is fixed to @xmath52 based on the h@xmath53  observations  @xcite .",
    "the resulting total proton energy , @xmath54  erg , is less than 10  % of the typical kinetic energy of a supernova explosion . for an electron - to - proton ratio @xmath55 at 1  gev  @xmath37 , which is the ratio measured at the earth",
    ", the magnetic field strength is constrained to be @xmath56 g by radio data . using the parameters summarized in table  [ tab : model ]",
    ", we obtained the seds shown in figure  [ fig : spec_multi ]  ( a ) .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum can be reproduced by an electron bremsstrahlung dominated model in figure  [ fig : spec_multi ]  ( b ) , although it is not easy to fit the data in the radio band simultaneously .",
    "the density used in this model is the same as that for the @xmath45-decay dominated model , while @xmath57 is set to 1 so that the leptonic emission dominates .",
    "an inverse compton dominated model can also reproduce the gamma - ray spectrum as shown in figure  [ fig : spec_multi ]  ( c ) .",
    "gamma - ray emission of ic origin is due to interactions of high - energy electrons with optical and infrared radiation fields and the cosmic microwave background  ( cmb ) .",
    "we used in our calculations the first two components as they are modeled in  @xcite at the location of hb  3 . since",
    "their spectra are very complex , they are approximated by two infrared blackbody components  ( @xmath58  k , @xmath59  ev  @xmath60 , respectively ) , and two optical blackbody components  ( @xmath61  k , @xmath62  ev  @xmath60 , respectively ) . the flux ratio between the ic and the synchrotron components constrains the magnetic field to be less than 1  @xmath63 g and requires a low gas density of @xmath64 to suppress the electron bremsstrahlung , which is unlikely . increasing the intensity of the interstellar radiation field other than cmb",
    "would loosen the constraint on the magnetic field and the gas density . a radiation field about 100 times more intense",
    "is required to satisfy the above assumption on the magnetic field and the gas density .    assuming that @xmath45-decay produced by the interactions of protons with ambient hydrogen is responsible for the bulk of the gamma - ray emission from the snr",
    ", the gamma - ray spectrum of w3 can be reasonably explained by a @xmath45-decay dominated model .",
    "if the protons are accelerated in the whole snr in the same manner and are not largely affected by spectral deformation due to cosmic - ray diffusion process , the gamma - ray spectrum of w3 is expected to be modeled with a similar proton spectrum .",
    "the curved lines in figure  [ fig : spec_w3 ] show the gamma - ray spectrum of w3 with the @xmath45-decay dominated model assuming the density in the molecular clouds is @xmath65 .",
    "the spectrum can be reproduced without any change from the proton momentum spectrum of the snr .",
    "the resulting total proton energy , @xmath66  erg , is about 5.5  % of that for the @xmath45-decay model of the snr , which is likely considering the solid angle of w3 from the center of the snr .",
    "* we also estimated the energy density of cosmic rays in w3 in order to confirm the enhancement of the energy density due to the snr compared to that from the local cosmic rays .",
    "the mass of the whole clouds of w3 is @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "we assume the cloud mass related to the gamma - ray emission to be about @xmath68 since the gamma - ray emission only comes from a small part of the w3 giant molecular cloud .",
    "the resulting density is @xmath69  ev  @xmath60 , where @xmath70 is the cloud mass related to the gamma - ray emission .",
    "this is much higher than the energy density of the local cosmic rays , indicating a strong association between the gamma - ray emission and the snr .",
    "* to summarize , it is most natural to assume that gamma - ray emission from hb  3 is dominated by decay of @xmath45 produced in nucleon - nucleon interactions of hadronic cosmic rays with interstellar matter .",
    "it should be emphasized that our observations around hb  3 provide a rare and valuable example where there are detections of gamma rays from both the adjacent interacting molecular cloud and the snr itself .",
    "* this differs from w44  @xcite and w28  @xcite where the adjacent gamma - ray emitting clouds are thought to be outside the snrs . *",
    "we detected extended gamma - ray emissions by using the lat data in the region of the snr hb  3 and the w3 h@xmath1  complex .",
    "the decay of @xmath45 produced by interactions of hadrons accelerated by the remnant with interstellar gas naturally explains the gamma - ray emission around hb  3 . assuming this , the gamma - ray emission from w3 is also reasonably explained by the interaction of cosmic rays accelerated by the snr with the dense gas in the clouds associated with w3 .",
