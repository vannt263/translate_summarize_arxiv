    "in the recent years , a number of manipulation experiments have been performed with the aim of gathering information on the equilibrium properties of complex molecular systems , such as biopolymers  @xcite . in particular , in a class of these experiments the jarzynski equality ( je )  @xcite has been exploited in order to evaluate the equilibrium free energy landscape of the system , even if the system is no more at equilibrium during the manipulation experiment .    in the present work ,",
    "we wish to investigate under what conditions the use of the je in its several forms is effective for the evaluation of the free energy landscape of a small system .",
    "indeed , the je requires the evaluation of the average of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the temperature ) and @xmath3 is the work exerted on the system .",

    "( [ sample ] ) , and the histogram method to reconstruct the free energy landscape of two simple systems driven out of equilibrium by manipulation of an external parameter .    in the case of the ising model in mean field approximation , the external magnetic field is manipulated both with a linear and with a periodic protocol . in both cases , for a sufficiently gentle protocol",
    ", the system free energy landscape is successfully evaluated .",
    "it is worth to note that , for the periodic protocol , the optimal frequency for the reconstruction of the landscape is somewhat larger than the smallest frequency here considered .",

    "however , we point out that this typical frequency is of the order of the frequency governing the system dynamics , which has been taken equal to one in the present work .",
    "this means that the manipulation has to be performed on time scales similar to the system characteristic time scale , in order for the free energy evaluation method here discussed to be successful .",
    "faster manipulations give unreliable estimates of the free energy function . in the case of the linear protocol",
    "we also consider the effect of the system size on the effectiveness of the histogram method . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , changing the system size @xmath108 corresponds to change the system energy scale .",
    "there , we showed that one can obtain a good estimate of the free energy difference , via the je , only for small system sizes ( small energy scales ) .",
    "similarly , the results of the present works indicate that the histogram method is effective for small system sizes .",
    "this conclusion widens the results of refs .",
    "@xcite on the histogram method , since in those references the effect of the energy scale was not considered .",
    "the second system here considered is a simple model of homopolymer , which is unzipped by applying an external force to one of its free ends .",
    "also in this case the external force is varied both with a linear and with a periodic protocol .",
    "the results of this simulated experiment have to be considered more carefully , with respect to the case of the ising model , since we do not know the exact shape of the polymer free energy landscape .",
    "we take as our best estimate of this landscape the one provided by the linear protocol with the smallest velocity .",
    "we find that the periodic force gives unreliable estimates of the free energy as a function of the polymer elongation , even for frequencies much smaller than the system characteristic frequency .",
    "this is at variance with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the periodic loading was found to be the optimal one for the evaluation of the free energy landscape of a model polymer .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy resides in the fact that our model polymer takes also into account the three - dimensional structure of the system , and when a periodic force is applied , the elongation coordinate is no longer a `` good '' collective coordinate , and fails to catch the connection between the system macroscopic state and its microscopic state , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ poly1 ] .",
    "in fact , the system has no time to recover its initial globular state , and keeps memory of previous trajectories at each manipulation cycle .",
    "our results suggest thus that in the realization of a real experimental set - up , if one wants to exploit the histogram method to evaluate the free energy landscape of a polymer , some care has to be taken with the choice of the manipulation protocol .",
    "the linear protocol , or the `` pulsed '' sinusoidal protocol , appear to be the best choices to this purpose .",
    "this is closely related to the original proposition of the je , which states that the equality holds _ if _ the system is in thermodynamical equilibrium at the beginning of the manipulation .",
    "finally , we have found that the polymer elongation is not a good state variable to describe the system when the manipulation occurs on too short times , since the system is not able to reach a quasi - equilibrium state defined by its instantaneous value . in this case , the concept of a free - energy landscape depending on this coordinate is ill - defined .",
