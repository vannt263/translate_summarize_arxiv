    "the well - known mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) @xcite solutions to the solar @xmath0 problem @xcite appear to have a somewhat different likelihood after the most recent data from the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment @xcite , as compared with previous fits @xcite .",
    "the new sk data , both by themselves @xcite and in combination with the results of the chlorine ( cl ) @xcite and gallium ( ga ) experiments ( sage @xcite , gallex and gno @xcite ) , tend now to favor the so - called large mixing angle ( lma ) and low mass ( low ) regions of the parameter space , with respect to the region at small mixing angle ( sma ) @xcite .",
    "this tendency emerges mainly from a `` tension '' between the flat ( normalized ) spectrum observed in sk and the prediction of a nonvanishing spectral distortion in the sma region favored by total rates @xcite .",
    "however , a compromise between such two discordant indications is still reached in global fits .",
    "figure  1 shows the results our global @xmath3 ( active ) oscillation fit to the latest 39 solar neutrino data , including the three sk , cl , and ga total rates @xcite , and the two 18-bin day and night sk energy spectra of events @xcite above 5.5 mev .",
    "we take as free variables the overall spectrum normalization ( to avoid double counting of the total sk rate information ) , the @xmath0 mass square difference @xmath1 , and the mixing angle @xmath4 , parametrized in terms of @xmath5 to cover the full range @xmath6 $ ] @xcite .",
    "details of our calculations and of the @xmath7 statistical analysis can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "subleading quasi - vacuum effects at low @xmath1 @xcite , recently revisited in @xcite , are taken into account as described in @xcite .",
    "the three local @xmath7 minima turn out to be @xmath8 ( lma ) , 38.7 ( low ) , and 40.7 ( sma ) .",
    "this implies , from the point of view of _ hypotheses tests _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath9 ) , that any of the three solutions is acceptable , since @xmath10 in any case . from the point of view of mass - mixing neutrino _",
    "_ @xcite ( @xmath11 ) , the relative likelihood is instead governed by @xmath12 . in fig .  1",
    ", @xmath13 contours at 90% , 95% , and 99% c.l .  are shown as thin solid , thick solid , and dotted curves , respectively .",
    "the low solution emerges at 84% c.l .",
    "( @xmath14 ) , while the sma solution emerges only at 94% c.l .",
    "( @xmath15 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows , for the sake of completeness , the regions favored by fits to total rates ( cl+ga+sk ) , and by the sk day - night spectra , at the same c.l.s as in fig .  1 .",
    "as already mentioned @xcite , a `` tension '' emerges between the total rate data ( which are highly consistent with the sma solution ) and the sk spectral data ( which disfavor such solution ) .",
    "however , this tension is not enough to exclude the sma region yet .",
    "in fact , a compromise is reached in the global fit of fig .  1 where , as compared with fig .  2",
    ", the sma solution survives at smaller mixing angles , corresponding to smaller spectral distortions .",
    "the price to pay is an increase in the c.l .",
    "at which the sma solution emerges ( 94% in fig .  1 ) , as compared with previous analyses @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the lma and low solutions appear to be favored over the sma solution in the global fit , although it is rather premature to think that the latter is ruled out . in the following",
    ", we discuss a possible way to discriminate the two most likely solutions ( lma and low ) in favorable situations , by separating earth regeneration effects in two distinct energy ranges .",
    "the slightly positive indication @xmath16 for an excess of nighttime to daytime events in super - kamiokande @xcite , if confirmed with higher statistical significance , would indicate the occurrence of the earth regeneration effect for @xmath17b solar neutrinos ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent night - day asymmetry studies in sk ) .",
    "such indication , by itself , might not be sufficient to discriminate the lma from the low solution , since a slight excess is predicted in both cases .",
    "however , it has long been known that the earth regeneration effect for solar neutrinos is strongly dependent on the neutrino energy @xcite .",
    "such dependence leads to several effects that might be observed in the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite and in the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite , including night - day variations of energy spectrum distortions @xcite , or variations of the night - day rate asymmetry with the electron energy threshold @xcite .",
    "in particular , starting from the simple observation that the earth regeneration effect is stronger at low energy for the low solution , and at high energy for the lma solution , we point out that it may be useful to study the night - day asymmetry in two separate energy ranges in both sk and sno .    for definiteness",
    ", we consider the two following representative ranges for the total ( measured ) energy of recoiling electrons in sk ( @xmath0-@xmath18 scattering ) and in sno ( @xmath0-@xmath19 absorption ) , @xmath20{\\rm\\ mev}\\ , \\\\",
    "{ \\rm high\\ range\\ } ( h ) & = & [ 7.5,20]{\\rm\\ mev}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and calculate the night - day rate asymmetry in such ranges,$ ] mev bin is not used yet in sk fits @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath21 since one expects @xmath22 for the lma solution and @xmath23 for the low solution , it is useful to introduce the difference @xmath24 which should change sign when passing from the lma region @xmath25 to the low region @xmath26 .    figures  3 and 4 show the results of our calculations of @xmath2 ( eccentricity effects removed ) in sk and sno , respectively , in the form of isolines at @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "notice that the magnitude of @xmath2 in sno is typically a factor of two higher than in sk .",
    "figures  3 and 4 confirm that @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) would represent clear evidence in favor of the lma ( low ) solution , both in sk and sno , thus allowing a useful `` sign discrimination test '' to solve the low - lma ambiguity at large mixing .",
    "the power of such test decreases as @xmath32 in the upper part ( lower part ) of the lma ( low ) solution , corresponding to vanishing earth regeneration effects for @xmath17b neutrinos in sk and sno .    from a comparison of figs .  1 , 3 , and 4 , it turns out that , in the most favorable case for the low solution ( i.e. , in its upper part ) , the quantity @xmath33 can approximately reach the value @xmath34 in sk and @xmath35 in sno ; analogously",
    ", it can reach the value @xmath36 ( sk ) and @xmath37 ( sno ) for the lma solution .",
    "the separation between the two solutions is thus @xmath38 in sk ( @xmath39 in sno ) and , in its upper range , it seems not too far from the present experimental sensitivity to day - night effects .",
    ", integrated over the full energy range , is @xmath40  ( stat . )  @xmath41  ( syst . ) @xcite .",
    "the ( larger ) total uncertainty of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the two @xmath44 and @xmath45 energy sub - ranges is presumably at the @xmath46 level , although we have not enough information for a precise estimate . ]    in general , however , one should require for detection of @xmath47 a typical sensitivity at the subpercent level in sk , and at the percent level in sno , whose viability requires not only a very high statistics , but also a dedicated study of systematics ( and of their cancellations in a difference like @xmath2 )",
    ". notice also that the energy value separating the @xmath45 and @xmath44 ranges does not need to be equal to our representative choice ( 7.5 mev ) nor to be the same in sk and sno , and should be tuned to optimize the statistical significance of the @xmath2-sign test .",
    "the test would in any case benefit from a reduction of the sk and sno energy thresholds , which would both increase the statistics and enhance the sensitivity to earth effects at low energies .",
    "such detailed experimental studies are beyond the scope of this work , whose main purpose is to emphasize that the difference of the night - day asymmetry at low and high neutrino energy in sk and sno might be observable in favorable situations , and help to separate the low and lma solutions . even in the absence of an accurate measurement of @xmath2 ,",
    "the simple _ concordance _ of the @xmath2 sign in sk _ and _ sno ( @xmath48 for the lma solution or @xmath49 for the low solution ) would be a valuable information .",
    "we have presented a global msw oscillation fit to the solar neutrino data , showing that all the three usual solutions ( sma , lma , and low ) emerge at 95% c.l .",
    "the low and lma solutions appear to be globally favored , the latter providing the best fit . within the lma ( low )",
    "solution , the excess of nighttime events due to @xmath50 regeneration in the earth is larger in the higher ( lower ) part of the neutrino energy range",
    ". therefore , by taking the difference @xmath2 of the night - day asymmetry in two separate ranges at high and low energy , a small positive ( negative ) signal would provide evidence for the lma ( low ) solution .",
    "detection of @xmath47 requires a ( sub)percent sensitivity to day - night effects , which needs to be assessed by further experimental investigations .",
    "however , the simple preference ( and concordance ) of the sk and sno experiments for a definite @xmath2 sign would already provide us with valuable information , corroborating other tests envisaged to solve the low - lma ambiguity in such experiments @xcite .",
