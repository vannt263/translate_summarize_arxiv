    ", we expect that most galaxies with @xmath24 have spheroidal shapes , while galaxies with @xmath25 tend to have thin disk shapes . for the distribution of stars in galaxies with @xmath24 , we used a spherically symmetric hernquist - like profile @xcite , @xmath41 where",

    "we here used the bolometric stellar mass - to - luminosity ratio @xmath55 of a single 3 gyr burst model with an age of 6 gyr from the galaxev population synthesis library @xcite in order to consider the radiation from long - lived , low - mass stars .",
    "as shown in the next section , a change of the model age or duration of the star formation does not significantly affect our results as long as more than 1 gyr passed since the star formation stopped .",
    "while our sample galaxies are expected to have various star formation histories and stellar ages , we simply use the single 3 gyr burst model with an age of 6 gyr , because we aim to investigate how the dust temperature is maintained only by low - mass stars after the star formation stopped rather than estimate the exact temperature of galaxies at the observed epoch .",
    "therefore , for star - forming galaxies , we infer the dust temperature in the case that the star formation was quenched by some mechanism such as supernova feedback immediately after the observed epoch and then short - lived massive stars died .",
    "in other words , we aim to confirm whether the dust temperature continues to be high enough to suppress the production of the molecular hydrogen and to maintain the passive evolution if the star formation has once stopped in the star - forming galaxies .    following @xcite , we simply adopted the following assumptions to estimate the steady - state dust temperature .",
    "( 1 ) the dust emission is expressed by the modified black body .",

    "although star - forming galaxies are expected to have some amount of dust extinction , we here consider the contribution only from low - mass stars , which radiate their energy mainly at the nir wavelength , and estimate the dust temperature expected after massive stars died for these galaxies as mentioned above .",
    "therefore the assumption ( 2 ) is reasonable for our purpose . under these assumptions ,",
    "the dust temperature is expressed as follows @xcite , @xmath56^{1/(4+\\beta)}u^{1/(4+\\beta)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the planck constant , boltzmann constant , and stephen - boltzmann constant , respectively .",

    "the emissivity slope of @xmath63 and the milky way dust model by @xcite with @xmath64 were assumed .",
    "we calculated @xmath65 from the milky way dust model and the stellar sed of the single 3 gyr burst model with an age of 6 gyr . since the stellar radiation field becomes stronger at smaller radii in a galaxy , the estimated dust temperature increases with decreasing radius . in order to ensure",
    "the dust temperature is higher than a given value over a significant volume of the galaxy , we adopt the temperature at a radius of @xmath66 .",
    "even if we use the temperature at a different radius such as @xmath37 or @xmath38 , the distribution of the dust temperature only slightly shifts to higher or lower values as shown in the next section and the results in this paper do not change .",
    "2.03.0 . , width=313 ]    we also checked the effects of our simplification for the 3-dimensional distribution of stellar mass by comparing the dust temperatures estimated with the spherically symmetric model and the thin disk model of the same objects . in figure",

    "our spherical model predicts slightly higher temperatures than the thin disk model , and the mean and dispersion of the differences between these models are @xmath68 k. the difference depends on the axial ratio , and the difference is very small ( @xmath69 k ) for objects with @xmath70 , while it becomes larger ( @xmath71 k ) for those with @xmath72 0.20.4 .",
    "since the differences between the two extreme cases ( i.e. , spherically symmetry and thin disk ) is relatively small , we expect that our simplification for the distribution of stars does not significantly affect our results .",

    "their deep 5-bands data from 100 to 500 @xmath17 m enable the estimation of the dust temperature with relatively high accuracy .",
    "since their sample has a wide range of stellar mass , we can expect a wide range of stellar surface density and dust temperature , which is essential for our purpose , although the sample is limited to the cluster galaxies .",
    "@xcite also estimated the stellar mass of the sample galaxies from their optical - nir colors .",
    "the estimate of the stellar m / l ratio was based on the population synthesis model by @xcite and the chabrier imf was assumed .",
    "we used the dust temperature and stellar mass from table 4 of @xcite .    in order to measure the surface brightness profile of these galaxies , we used @xmath75-band images from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these data have a pixel scale of 0.4 arcsec / pixel and the psf fwhm of @xmath51 1.5 arcsec .",
    "we performed the same procedure of the surface brightness fitting with galfit to determine the best - fit srsic index @xmath28 , half - light semi - major radius @xmath29 , and half - light semi - minor radius @xmath30 . using the fitted parameters of the srsic profile from the sdss @xmath75-band data and the stellar mass from @xcite , we then estimated the dust temperature at a radius of @xmath66 as described in the previous section .",
    "we excluded the objects for which the dust temperature can not be determined by the fir sed fitting of @xcite or the effective radius can not be reliably derived in the surface brightness fitting , for example , due to their faintness on the sdss images .",

    "we also checked the expected dust temperatures at the different radii , namely @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the galaxies .",
    "the differences between the observed temperature and the expected ones with the 6 gyr age model are @xmath82 k for @xmath80 and @xmath83 k for @xmath81 .",

    "the results in the next section do not change even if we use the different radii .",
    "the expected dust temperature at @xmath66 seems to show a better agreement with the observed temperature than those at the smaller and larger radii , which may be consistent with the relatively compact morphology of the fir dust emission in these galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we performed the same analysis with @xmath84-band images from the 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) in order to examine the effect of the morphological k - correction on the estimate of the dust temperature .",
    "the pixel scale of these data is 1.0 arcsec / pixel and the psf fwhm is @xmath51 3 arcsec .",
    "the difference between the observed and expected temperatures is @xmath85 k. the difference between those with the @xmath75-band and @xmath84-band images is @xmath51 2 k on average , which is considered to be relatively small if we take account of the dispersion around the mean and the different depth and spatial resolution between the sdss @xmath75-band and 2mass @xmath84-band data .    in summary ,",
    "the dust temperature estimated from the stellar mass and surface brightness profile agrees relatively well with the observed temperature for early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster with a dispersion of @xmath51 34 k. there can be also the systematics of @xmath51 34 k in the estimated temperature , depending on the assumed star formation history in the sed model , the wavelength where the surface brightness is measured , and the radius used in the calculation of the dust temperature . keeping in mind these uncertainties , we discuss the expected dust temperature for passively evolving and star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 in the following section .",
    "we show the distribution of the surface stellar mass density and expected dust temperature as a function of stellar mass for passively evolving and star - forming galaxies at @xmath7 in figure [ fig : smdt ] . as previously reported ( e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "most galaxies with a high surface stellar mass density of @xmath86/kpc@xmath87 are passively evolving ones especially at @xmath1 . similarly , most of passively evolving galaxies show a relatively high dust temperature of @xmath2 k at @xmath1 .",
    "the expected dust temperature at smaller radii is higher because the stellar radiation increases with decreasing radius .",
    "since we adopted the temperature at a radius of @xmath66 in the figure , the dust temperature is expected to be higher than 20 k over a significant volume in most of massive passively evolving galaxies .",

    "circles show galaxies with the srsic index of @xmath24 , while triangles represent those with @xmath25 .",
    "the surface stellar mass density is calculated by @xmath88 , which corresponds to the averaged value within a half - light radius .",
    ", width=313 ]    since the energy density by the radiation from a star with a luminosity @xmath89 at a distance of @xmath90 is expressed by @xmath91 , the stellar radiation field by all stars at a given point in the galaxy is proportional to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the size of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the stellar radiation field in galaxies is directly related with their surface stellar mass density , and the close relationship between the dust temperature and the surface stellar mass density is naturally expected .",
    "figure [ fig : uvt ] shows the rest - frame @xmath26 color as a function of the expected dust temperature for galaxies with @xmath1 in the different redshift bins .",
    "the rest - frame color becomes redder with increasing the dust temperature at all redshifts , and passively evolving galaxies on the red sequence dominate at @xmath94 2025 k. the transition temperature between star - forming and passively evolving populations does not seem to significantly evolve with time .",
    "we show the fraction of passively evolving galaxies as a function of the dust temperature in figure [ fig : fpt ] .",
    "the fraction strongly depends on the dust temperature and increases rapidly with increasing the temperature around @xmath3 k.    recent observations of nearby early - type galaxies by the herschel satellite revealed that massive early - type galaxies in fact tend to have a relatively high dust temperature of @xmath2 k ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite reported that early - type galaxies show systematically higher dust temperatures than late - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggested that massive early - type galaxies tend to have higher dust temperature than low - mass early - type ones .",
    "@xcite also reported that the bulge of m31 , which has no young stellar population , shows a high dust temperature of 20 - 35 k , while the temperature in the star - forming disk is @xmath95 k. they found that the temperature profile of the m31 bulge can be explained by the stellar radiation field from its old stars .",

    "data points for the temperature bins which include more than 10 passively evolving galaxies are plotted .",
    "the total number of galaxies with @xmath1 ( shaded histogram ) and @xmath20 ( open histogram ) is also shown in the upper panel . , width=313 ]    the dust temperature @xmath96 k corresponds to a temperature above which the formation efficiency of the molecular hydrogen in the diffuse ism is expected to be very low from the laboratory experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular hydrogen can not be efficiently formed in the gas phase , and its formation is considered to occur on the surface of dust grains , which work as catalysts @xcite",
    ". however , the hydrogen atom that sticks to the surface of the grain quickly desorbs and can not remain on the surface to encounter another atom and form a molecule at @xmath97 k , although this may not be the case for more dense photo - dissociation regions of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus if low - mass stars in massive galaxies has heated up the dust grains to @xmath98 k , the formation of the molecular hydrogen could have been suppressed in the diffuse ism of these galaxies .",
    "such a suppression of the formation of the molecular hydrogen is expected to play an important role for the passive evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "if we consider that the gas is accreting and cooling from higher temperatures after the star formation has once been stopped by , for example , intense supernova feedback , the hi gas is expected to settle to the equilibrium temperature ( e.g. , @xmath99 k for the cold neutral medium in the milky way ; @xcite ) determined from a balance between the heating mainly by photoelectron from dust grains and cosmic - ray ionization and the radiative cooling by the emission lines such as [ cii ] 158 @xmath17 m and [ oi ] 63 @xmath17 m @xcite . if the formation of the molecular hydrogen proceeds in the cold hi gas , the self - shielding effect of the molecular hydrogen on the uv radiation would suppress the heating , which leads to further cooling of the gas and the star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the formation of the molecular hydrogen in the diffuse ism is suppressed due to the high dust temperature , the hi gas would keep the equilibrium temperature . therefore the dust heating by long - lived , low - mass stars in massive galaxies can cause the continuation of their passive evolution .",
    "recent observational studies of the hi gas in local early - type galaxies found that a significant fraction of massive early - type galaxies have a moderate amount of hi gas ( e.g. , @xmath100@xmath101 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the low star - formation activity of such galaxies may be related with their high dust temperature .    on the other hand ,",
    "several studies with radio observations also detected the co lines in a significant fraction of nearby early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the morphology of the detected co lines tends to be centrally concentrated and those early - type galaxies with the co detection show the star formation activity at their central region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case that the cold gas can be concentrated into the center of the galaxy , for example , by the galaxy interactions , the molecular hydrogen may be formed and star formation may occur irrespective of the dust temperature , because the high density of the gas and dust can lead to a enough shielding for the uv radiation by the dust absorption and the gas can be cooled to form the molecular hydrogen . otherwise , some of the detected molecular gas may be explained by the external origin , namely , the cold gas accretion into the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that the molecular gas is detected preferentially in the fast rotator early - type galaxies , while there is few slow rotators with the co detection .",
    "therefore the mass assembly history may be related with the existence of the molecular gas in early - type galaxies .",
    "since the surface stellar mass density of the fast rotators tends to be lower than that of the slow rotators @xcite , the dust temperature may cause the difference between these two populations in the co detection rate .",
    "it is noted that low - mass passively evolving galaxies have the similar surface mass density with star - forming galaxies , and therefore their dust temperature is expected to be correspondingly low ( see figure [ fig : smdt ] ) .",
    "the passive evolution of these low - mass galaxies may be explained by other mechanisms such as environmental or satellite quenching ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    while we assumed the sed of the old stellar population to investigate the effect of the radiation from low - mass stars ,",
    "there are young massive stars in star - forming galaxies .",
    "although these massive stars are much luminous than low - mass stars and heat the surrounding dust , the ultraviolet light from these stars is efficiently absorbed by the surrounding dust and molecular hydrogen ( self - shielding ) .",
    "therefore the temperature of the cold dust in disks of spiral galaxies tends to be relatively low ( @xmath102 k ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while there is also the warm dust component . on the other hand , such self - shielding effect for the near - infrared radiation from low - mass stars",
    "is expected to be much lower .",
    "thus the radiation from low - mass stars may play a role to heat the dust globally in star - forming galaxies when low - mass stars are sufficiently accumulated as the star formation proceeds .",
    "the dust heating by low - mass stars can contribute to the passive evolution of massive compact galaxies found at @xmath103 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since a very strong stellar radiation field is expected within such compact massive galaxies , the dust temperature is probably high in these objects .",
    "the effect of the high dust temperature may also be consistent with the inside - out scenario of the massive galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation outside a compact core could be permitted if the radiation field is relatively low at outer regions , while the formation of molecular hydrogen is strongly suppressed within the core .",

    "<S> using the _ hubble space telescope_/wide field camera 3 imaging data and multi - wavelength photometric catalog , we investigated the dust temperature of passively evolving and star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 in the candels fields . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the stellar radiation field by low - mass stars from the stellar mass and surface brightness profile of these galaxies and then calculated their steady - state dust temperature . at first </S>",
    "<S> , we tested our method using nearby early - type galaxies with the deep fir data by the herschel virgo cluster survey and confirmed that the estimated dust temperatures are consistent with the observed temperatures within the uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we then applied the method to galaxies at @xmath0 , and found that most of passively evolving galaxies with @xmath1 have a relatively high dust temperature of @xmath2 k , for which the formation efficiency of molecular hydrogen on the surface of dust grains in the diffuse ism is expected to be very low from the laboratory experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of passively evolving galaxies strongly depends on the expected dust temperature at all redshifts and increases rapidly with increasing the temperature around @xmath3 k. these results suggest that the dust heating by low - mass stars in massive galaxies plays an important role for the continuation of their passive evolution , because the lack of the shielding effect of the molecular hydrogen on the uv radiation can prevent the gas cooling and formation of new stars . </S>"
