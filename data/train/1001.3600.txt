    "the aim of this paper is the investigation of the spectral theory of laplacians of certain rooted trees . in these trees",
    "the vertices are labeled with finitely many labels each encoding the whole forward cone of the vertex .",
    "accordingly , these trees can be considered as trees of finite cone type .",
    "such trees can be generated by substitution processes on a finite set .",
    "thus , one can also consider them as substitution trees .",
    "assuming some irreducibility of the underlying substitution , we can completely describe the spectrum of the associated laplacians : it is purely absolutely continuous and consists of finitely many intervals . in this sense",
    "these trees behave like laplacians on lattices with periodic potentials .",
    "our main result then deals with perturbations by potentials .",
    "we assume that the underlying substitution has a strongly connected graph , i.e. , each vertex is connected with any other vertex .",
    "we then consider potentials which are radially label symmetric ( i.e. , within each sphere of vertices the potential depends only on the label of each vertex ) . for such potentials with sufficiently small coupling",
    "we show persistence of absolutely continuous spectrum on any fixed proper piece of the spectrum ( away from some finite exceptional energies ) provided the tree is non regular . for regular trees on the other hand ,",
    "the absolutely continuous spectrum can be destroyed by arbitrary small such potentials ( as is well known ) . in this sense",
    "the loss of symmetry ( i.e. , regularity of the tree ) stabilizes the absolutely continuous spectrum .    in a companion work the results of this paper",
    "will be used to tackle stability under random perturbations @xcite .",
    "let us put our models and results in perspective .",
    "our basic aim is to study absolutely continuous spectrum and its persistence under ( small ) perturbations for certain tree models .    of course , generically in a topological sense , families of self - adjoint operators tend to lack an absolutely continuous component in their spectra  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , in the context of trees , breuer @xcite and breuer / frank @xcite proved that absolutely continuous spectrum does typically not occur for certain radial tree operators ( i.e. , in an essentially one dimensional situation ) .    our class of tree models ( and potentials )",
    "is characterized by a certain type of symmetry condition vaguely reminiscent of a form of periodicity .",
    "thus , we are in a very non - generic situation and our stability result does not contradict generic absence of absolutely continuous spectrum .    in the case of vanishing potential ,",
    "our tree models have already attracted a lot of attention in the context of random walks under the name of periodic trees or trees with finite cone type @xcite ( see @xcite for related material as well ) .",
    "these works deal with questions such as recurrence and transience of random walks .",
    "this amounts to studying the limiting behavior of resolvents at a single energy viz .",
    "the infimum of the spectrum .",
    "our situation is substantially more complicated as we have to control the limiting behavior for all spectral energies and at the same time also allow for a potential .",
    "one can also think of our trees as arising as codings of all paths with a fixed initial point in a finite directed graph ( the substitution graph ) . in this sense ,",
    "our trees are coverings of directed finite graphs . for abelian covering of finite graphs ,",
    "absolutely continuous spectrum has recently been shown by higuchi / nomura @xcite by means of fourier / bloch type analysis .",
    "as ours is not an abelian covering such an analysis does not seem to be at our disposal .",
    "still the results bear a remarkable resemblance .",
    "this is an interesting phenomenon which may be worth further exploration .",
    "finally , there is a strong interest in absolutely continuous spectrum for trees from the point of view of random schrdinger operators .",
    "such operators have extensively been studied in the past ( see e.g. the monographs @xcite for details and further literature ) .",
    "they exhibit localization , i.e. , pure point spectrum ( under suitable assumptions on the random potential ) .",
    "it is generally believed that such random operators will also allow for some absolutely continuous spectrum in sufficiently high dimensions .",
    "so far , this could not be proven in finite dimensions . however",
    ", a remarkable result of klein @xcite shows that in the infinite dimensional situation ( i.e. , for regular trees ) one does indeed have persistence of absolutely continuous spectrum .",
    "recent years have seen a new interest in klein s result .",
    "in fact two alternative approaches to his result have been given by froese / hasler / spitzer @xcite and aizenman / sims / warzel @xcite respectively .",
    "our approach opens the possibility to deal with a substantially larger class of trees .",
    "details will be given in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : modelandresults ]",
    "we introduce our model and present the results .",
    "basic properties of the resolvents of the operators are studied in section  [ s : greenfunction ] .",
    "in particular the recursion relations of resolvents plays a crucial role in the analysis .",
    "these can be translated into a system of polynomial equations , see section  [ s : polynomial ] , and into a fixed point equation of a recursion map , see section  [ s : recursionmap ] . finally , using these viewpoints on the recursion relations , the proofs of our main results are given in the last section .",
    "a tree is a connected graph without loops . in a tree with a distinguished vertex called the root  @xmath0 ,",
    "the vertices can be ordered according to spheres , i.e. , the distance @xmath1 to the root .",
    "we are interested in special rooted trees generated as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite set whose elements we call labels and consider a matrix @xmath3 which we call the substitution matrix .",
    "to each label @xmath4 we construct inductively a tree @xmath5 with vertex set @xmath6 and edges @xmath7 together with a labeling of the vertices , i.e. , a function @xmath8 .",
    "the root of the tree gets the label @xmath9 .",
    "each vertex with label @xmath10 of the @xmath11-th sphere is joined by single non - directed edges to @xmath12 vertices with label @xmath9 of the @xmath13 sphere .",
    "we assume that the tree is not one - dimensional , i.e. , if @xmath2 consists of one element such that @xmath14 is thus a natural number , this number is at least @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , we impose two conditions on @xmath14 , viz .",
    "* @xmath16 for all @xmath17 _ ( positive diagonal)_. * there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath19 has positive entries _",
    "( primitivity)_.    let us give two examples of such trees .",
    "assume @xmath2 consists of only one element and @xmath14 is a natural number @xmath20 .",
    "then , @xmath21 is a @xmath22-regular tree , i.e. , a tree where each vertex has exactly @xmath22 forward neighbors .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 where the first row is associated to  @xmath25 and the second one to   @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ f : tree ] illustrates the tree @xmath27 .",
    "the topic of this paper are the spectral properties of operators of laplace - type on @xmath28 . in order to ease the notation , we present the results and proofs for the case of the adjacency matrix which acts as @xmath29 where @xmath30 means that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are connected by an edge .",
    "we stress that this choice is only for simplicity and our results also apply in case we include edge weights and/or potentials which are invariant with respect to the labeling ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "our first main result completely describes the spectrum of this operator .",
    "[ main1 ] _ there exist finitely many intervals such that for every @xmath4 the spectrum of @xmath33 associated with the tree @xmath34 consists of exactly these intervals and is purely absolutely continuous . _",
    "it is well known that for @xmath33 on a one - dimensional tree @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath33 on @xmath35 , the theorem remains true .",
    "however , the other assumptions ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) are vital as the following counter example shows .",
    "a tree constructed from @xmath14 which does not satisfy @xmath36 may have eigenvalues : consider for example a tree with two labels and the substitution matrix @xmath37 .",
    "then , @xmath38 possesses an eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath39 .",
    "this eigenfunction vanishes on the even spheres and has values @xmath40 and @xmath41 at the vertices of the @xmath42 spheres .",
    "next , we introduce a class of potentials on @xmath21 for which vertices with the same label and with the same distance @xmath43 to the root get the same value .",
    "more specifically , we call a function @xmath44 _ radially label symmetric _ if @xmath45 and @xmath46 implies @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "our main result is the stability of the absolutely continuous spectrum of the laplacian under small perturbations by such radially label symmetric potentials in case of non regular trees .    as usual",
    "a regular tree is a tree where every vertex has the same number of forward neighbors .",
    "[ main2 ] _ assume that @xmath21 is a non regular tree .",
    "then , for every compact set @xmath49 contained in the interior of @xmath50 there exist @xmath51 such that for all radially label symmetric @xmath52 $ ] we have @xmath53 _    * remarks . *",
    "( a ) for regular trees there are potentials @xmath54 $ ] which destroy the absolutely continuous spectrum of @xmath33 completely no matter how small we choose @xmath55 .",
    "examples of such potentials are radially symmetric ones , where the common value of the potential in each sphere is a random variable .",
    "their absolutely continuous spectrum coincides with that of the associated one - dimensional operator and therefore vanishes almost surely @xcite . as is shown in the above theorem if we exclude regular trees then an arbitrary large part of the absolute continuous spectrum is stable for small radially label symmetric perturbations .",
    "\\(b ) the previous theorem assumes some symmetry of the potential",
    ". it may be interesting to study whether this symmetry assumption is indeed necessary for persistence of absolutely continuous spectrum .",
    "\\(c ) for more general operators than @xmath33 , namely those whose edge weights and the diagonal are label invariant , a similar statement holds .",
    "there , we have to exclude a finite set of energies instead of only @xmath39 from @xmath56 . for details",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "finally we consider radial label symmetric potential which vanish at infinity .",
    "[ main3 ] _ assume that @xmath21 is a non regular tree .",
    "then , for every radially label symmetric @xmath57 with @xmath58 as @xmath59 we have @xmath60 _    * remark .",
    "* note that we do not need any assumptions on the decay rate of @xmath57 .",
    "we only need that the potential becomes arbitrary small eventually in order to have full preservation of absolutely continuous spectrum .",
    "this stands in strong contrast to the one dimensional situation , see e.g. @xcite and references therein , or the situation of regular trees , cf .",
    "in this section we introduce the green function of the operator @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , we recall some basic properties such as the recursion formulas for the truncated version of the green function .",
    "the statements of the first two subsections are proven for arbitrary rooted trees @xmath61 , where the operator @xmath33 acting as is bounded on @xmath28 .",
    "this is exactly the case whenever the number of forward neighbors is uniformly bounded in the vertices . in the last subsection we restrict attention to trees of finite cone type .    for a bounded function @xmath44",
    "we denote the operator of multiplication also by @xmath57 and we let @xmath62      the spectral measure associated with the characteristic function @xmath63 of a vertex @xmath64 is denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "its borel transform , i.e. , the green function @xmath66 of @xmath67 in @xmath32 is defined on the upper half plane @xmath68 by @xmath69 note that the spectral measures @xmath65 are the vague limits of @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "so , whenever @xmath72 remains bounded for all energies @xmath7 in some interval as @xmath71 , the spectral measures @xmath65 is purely absolutely continuous .",
    "an effective way for its computation is to look at the green function of truncated trees at some vertex .",
    "we denote by @xmath73 the forward tree of a vertex @xmath64 with respect to the root of @xmath21 , i.e. , if one deletes the unique edge that is adjacent to @xmath32 in the path connecting @xmath32 to the root of @xmath21 , then @xmath74 is the connected component that contains @xmath64 .",
