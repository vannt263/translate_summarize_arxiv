    "also , we find that luminosity of co gas per unit stellar mass from dynamo galaxies is consistent with the center of the distribution of that of phibss galaxies",
    ". the high gas fractions , and co flux ratios , in dynamo galaxies are not due to low stellar masses , which span the range from @xmath59  m@xmath8 , similar to stellar masses found in gas rich phibss galaxies , and much higher than local gas rich dwarfs .",

    "* ) , as @xmath69 .",
    "the correlation with redshift is weaker by comparison , and in the right hand panel we show that the nearby dynamo galaxies are clear outliers to the trend , falling in the range populated by @xmath70 galaxies .",
    "also , @xmath71% ( 11/51 ) of galaxies with @xmath72 are located within the spread of the @xmath66-specific sfr relationship for @xmath73 ( cold gass ) galaxies .",
    "in summary , we find that the nearby @xmath12 dynamo galaxies we target are very similar to the star forming galaxies observed by @xcite , which are found at @xmath74 , in both their gas fractions and depletion times .",
    "in this paper we report observations that suggest high gas fractions in three nearby clumpy , turbulent galaxies from the dynamo sample . assuming a disk - like co - to - h@xmath25 conversion , the molecular gas fractions ( @xmath47 ) of these three galaxies are @xmath75% . compared to other low - redshift galaxies ,",
    "the dynamo galaxies are strong outliers : they are gas - rich like @xmath76 galaxies , but they are located in the local universe . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdep ] , the displacement of galaxies , including our target galaxies , from the @xmath77 relations defined by the local cold gass survey is more strongly correlated with gas fraction than it is to redshift .",
    "we remind the reader of the caveat that this result depends on the assumption of the disk - like @xmath4 for dynamo and phibss galaxies .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of our results is that , independent of redshift , having very large gas fraction is a crucial factor to determining a galaxies star forming properties , such as the presence of massive star forming clumps .",
    "giant star forming clumps , like those in fig .  [",
    "fig : clumps ] , may be associated with local gravitational instabilities @xcite in disks that are marginally stable ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under the assumption that g  04 - 1 and d13 - 5 are disks , and that their clumps are due to turbulent gravitational instabilities",
    ", we expect that these galaxies would be unstable as well , and thus have @xmath78 .",
    "we note that an alternate hypothesis , in which g  04 - 1 and d  13 - 5 are the result of merging , this calculation would have less meaning , and @xmath79 values would be affected by the change to the gas fractions , discussed in   2  &  3 .",
    "similar to @xcite , we express the @xcite @xmath79 parameter as a function of the gas fraction , rotation velocity ( v ) , and velocity dispersion ( @xmath80 ) as follows in disks , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . ] : @xmath81 in the local universe , typical disks are stable , with @xmath82 @xcite . taking the dynamical quantities from @xcite , assuming @xmath83 for a keplerian disk and the non - merger conversion co - to - h@xmath25 factor , we measure @xmath84 for d  13 - 5 and @xmath85 for g  04 - 1 . assuming these galaxies are truly disks , these results are consistent with a picture in which the clumps observed in dynamo galaxies are likely the result of unstable gas .",
    "we conclude by noting the continued similarity between dynamo galaxies and turbulent disks seen at high redshifts .",
    "many dynamo galaxies have internal dynamical structures similar to those observed in @xmath86 galaxies @xcite : they are rotating disks with high internal velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "we now add that observations indicate clumpy h@xmath1 morphologies , high gas fractions , and that they lie on the same portion of the depletion time vs. specific star formation rate diagram occupied by star - forming galaxies at high redshift . taken together",
    ", the evidence continues to be consistent with the hypothesis that dynamo galaxies are indeed close analogues to the clumpy galaxies seen at high redshift . in future papers",
    "our group will exploit the proximity of dynamo to study both high spatial resolution properties of galaxies with massive star forming clumps ( fisher et al .",
