    "quantum fisher information ( qfi)@xcite which is one of the most important ingredients in parameter estimation fields has been extensively investigated in both the classical and quantum worlds .",
    "qfi characterizing the sensitivity of a state with respect to perturbation of the parameters is employed as a measure to quantify the precision of parameter estimation .",
    "the parameter estimation is the purpose of the information in a finite number of observation value to obtain highest precision of the parameter and design schemes to attain that precision which is bounded by the quantum cramr - rao inequality,@xcite i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of experiments and @xmath9 denotes the qfi of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this inequality indicates that the inverse of the qfi provides the lower bound of the error of the estimation . on the other hand",
    ", qfi is formally generalized from the classical one , and there are several variants of quantum versions of fisher information@xcite , among which the one based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative operator has been used most widely .",
    "for example , assume that a parameter @xmath4 is encoded in quantum states @xmath10 , and then the qfi of @xmath4 is defined as@xcite @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the so - called symmetric logarithmic derivative , which is determined by @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "making use of the spectrum decomposition , one can diagonalize the matrix as @xmath15 . and",
    "then the qfi can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the qfi for pure state @xmath18 with the form @xmath19 $ ] . given any single qubit states @xmath20 , one can rewrite the form as @xmath21 in the bloch sphere representation , where @xmath22 is the real bloch vector and @xmath23 denotes the pauli matrices . according to ref.@xcite ,",
    "a simple and explicit expression of qfi could be obtained in terms of the bloch sphere representation @xmath24 @xmath25    from the perspective of parameter estimation , the larger qfi represents the higher estimation precision in general .",
    "hence , how to improve the qfi becomes a key problem to be solved .",
    "making use of quantum resources such as coherence , entanglement and so on , one can find that qfi of quantum systems can provide much more sensitivity than the classical ones even to beat the shot noise limit in principle , in particular , under some circumstances , one can even achieve the heisenberg limit  @xcite .",
    "however , in the realistic physical parameter estimation process , the quantum system unavoidably interacts with the surrounding environments , so that the qfis dynamics decreases monotonically with time resulting in the decrease of parameter estimation precision . in recent years , how to improve the estimation precision has become a significant issue in both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "different protocols and strategies have been proposed and realized to improve the precisions of various parameters .",
    "for example , tan et al . reported the improvement precision of parameter estimation in atom interferometer under dephasing noise by using dynamical decoupling pulses  @xcite .",
    "zhang et al . proposed a scheme to enhance the precision of quantum estimation by increasing entanglement of the input state  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the classical driving , abdel - khalek studied the qfi for a two - level atom system driven by a phase noise laser under non - markovian dynamics  @xcite .",
    "later , parameter estimation precision of a non - markovian dissipative two - state system by classical driving is also studied by li  @xcite .",
    "taking non - markovian effect into consideration , a qubit system in non - markovian environment becomes a good candidate for implementation of quantum optics schemes and information with high precision  @xcite . applying quantum feedback , zheng et al . analyzed the parameter precision of optimal quantum estimation of a dissipative qubit  @xcite . besides",
    ", the enhancement of the precision of phase estimation in quantum metrology is investigated by employing weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal  @xcite .",
    "so far , most previous literature studying the precision of parameter estimation have been mainly focused on the hermitian or quasi - hermitian systems which govern the interest system unitary evolution  @xcite . in particular , others have been focused on estimating an overall multiplicative factor of a hamiltonian  @xcite , for example , estimating @xmath26 in a hamiltonian @xmath27  @xcite . in a recent work",
    "@xcite , liu et al . studied a general hamiltonian parameter estimation problem where the qfi for an exponential form initial state involved in a hermitian operator .",
    "they found that the qfi is totally determined by this hermitian hamiltonian and the initial state .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , few detailed investigations are concern on estimating a non - hamiltonian parameter .",
    "motivated by these works , we here take advantage of the presence of @xmath0 operator instead of hermitian one . in particular , we would like to answer questions such as the following : for a @xmath0 hamiltonian , is it much more efficient than hermitian one to increase the precision of parameter estimation ?",
    "how does the @xmath0 process achieve better precision than hermitian one ?    to anticipate these questions , this paper extends parameter estimation to a @xmath0 case , we propose two schemes to enhance the parameters estimation by applying property of the non - hermitian hamiltonian process .",
    "the proposed schemes are related to apply the @xmath1 or the @xmath2 non - hermitian operators process .",
    "the former case corresponding to before the interest system suffers from decoherence channel , a non - hermitian hamiltonian operator is operated , and the later case is opposite . in contrast with the results obtained in ref.@xcite , we derive the exact expressions of the qfis with respect to the amplitude parameter @xmath3 and the phase parameter @xmath4 in terms of the bloch sphere representation , and in detail investigate the influence of non - hermitian operator on the qfis . from our results , it turns out that ( i)one can improve the precision of parameter estimation by applying the non - hermitian operator process .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath32 of a closed system in conventional quantum mechanics is hermitian , which requires not only the eigenvalues are real , but also the time - evolution of the system is unitary . however , bender et al .",
    "@xcitehave recently found that the parity - time - symmetric hamiltonian , which is non - hermitian , can also have real energy spectra under some conditions .",
    "given a hermitian hamiltonian @xmath32 of the interest system , the evolution of the final state from time zero to @xmath33 is given by a map @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a time evolution operator .",
    "according to conventional quantum theory , the evolution of the state is also generated by the schr@xmath36dinger equation @xmath37throughout this paper , we set @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding density matrix of the entire system can be written as @xmath39 , which satisfies @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in what follows we consider a different scenario by replacing the @xmath42 hamiltonian with a @xmath0 one .",
    "for simplified , we assume this non - hermitian hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath43where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are real numbers . based on bender et al  @xcite ,",
    "it is shown that the non - hermiticity of @xmath32 can have real eigenvalues if it possesses parity - time symmetry , namely @xmath46 $ ] . here",

    "hence , it is not difficult to conclude the eigenvalues of @xmath32 real satisfy the condition @xmath53 and its eigenvalues are @xmath54 . according to non - hermitian quantum theory , to obtain the evolution of the system , one should introduce a time - evolving operator @xmath55 , @xmath56defining @xmath57 which is related to @xmath44 when fixed @xmath58 .",

    ", we firstly review the framework of parameter estimation .",
    "usually the precision of parameter estimation is composed of three stages : the first stage is the preparation of initial state , the second stage is the sampling stage involved in the parameter code , and the third stage is the measurement corresponding to the parameter estimate . in following , we will adopt this framework to investigate the effect of non - hermitian operators process on the parameter estimation of the amplitude parameter @xmath3 and the phase parameter @xmath4 in terms of qfis for a two - level qubit subjected to a decoherence noisy environment .",

    "<S> recently , zhong et al . [ phys . rev . a 87 , 022337(2013 ) ] investigated the dynamics of quantum fisher information ( qfi ) in the presence of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> we here reform their results and propose two schemes to enhance and preserve the qfis for a qubit system subjected to a decoherence noisy environment by applying @xmath0 operator process . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed schemes are related to the @xmath1 ( or the @xmath2 ) non - hermitian operator process corresponding to before ( or after ) the interest system suffers from decoherence , respectively . resorting to the bloch sphere representation , we derive the exact analytical expressions of the qfis with respect to the amplitude parameter @xmath3 and the phase parameter @xmath4 , and in detail investigate the influence of @xmath0 operator parameters on the qfis . compared with pure decoherence process ( without non - hermitian operator process ) , we find that the @xmath5 operator process can potentially enhance and preserve the qfis by choosing appropriate @xmath0 operator parameters , while with the help of the @xmath6 operator process one could completely eliminate the effect of decoherence to improve the parameters estimation . finally , a generalized non - hermitian operator parameters effect on the parameters estimation is also considered . </S>"
