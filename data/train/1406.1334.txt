    "increasing @xmath97 to the range @xmath187 close to the stability threshold the agreement between the results of the two codes is much better .",
    "the relative deviation of the island half widths is approximately 10% for @xmath188 in both setups and vanishes practically for higher wavenumbers .",
    "this shows that for @xmath189 both models agree very well .",
    "therefore , there are no significant differences between the gyrofluid and the gyrokinetic models for small island widths ,  i.e.  when @xmath190 .",
    "so for the cases investigated here , in which the island half width and the current layer thickness @xmath138 are much smaller than the equilibrium scales , the fluid description produces practically the same island half widths as the more complete kinetic model .",
    "the comparison between the models also shows that the island width is slightly higher in the fluid description than in the kinetic model .",
    "these are the first extended comparisons of the saturated island width in slab geometry over a broad range of parameter .",
    "+    since for both parameter cases the ion skin depth is much larger than the electron skin depth , @xmath191 , electron inertia dominates completely .",
    "this regime has been investigated analytically in an early kinetic approach by drake and lee  @xcite , where it was shown that the tearing mode saturates approximately when @xmath192 , which in this regime means @xmath193 . a more detailed estimation yields @xmath194 with @xmath195  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the small island limit , @xmath196 , the saturated island half width is described only by the skin depth @xmath197 and the tearing mode stability parameter @xmath96 , which for our choice of the equilibrium is known analytically from eq .",
    "( [ eq_dpr ] ) . + the analytical prediction in comparison with our simulation results depending on @xmath97",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig_nlinwithdrake ] .",
    "( [ eq_drakenlin ] ) well reflects the qualitative behaviour of @xmath159 over the shown @xmath97-range , and agrees more closely with the gyrokinetic results than the gyrofluid ones .",
    "the deviations of the prediction of @xmath159 can be caused by assumptions which are not completely valid in the simulations .",
    "for instance , in the analytical estimations the shifted background maxwellian was not used rigorously , and in addition the density response was neglected .",
    "+ for both parameter cases investigated here , the island width does not seem to depend on the values of @xmath198 , as can be seen by comparing the left and right panels of figure  [ fig_w_bothcases ] .",
    "this suggests that there is no influence of finite electron temperature effects on the island width .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the analytical prediction , eq .",
    "( [ eq_drakenlin ] ) , does not contain finite electron temperature effects related to @xmath199 , which are linked to finite pressure effects and the width of the ion inflow region  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath199 is comparable to the electron skin depth and the analytical model does not contain this quantity , it is unclear whether it plays an important role in nonlinear simulations with both kinetic species . to investigate this dependence we fix the parameters @xmath200 and vary @xmath201 .",
    "the simulations have shown that the island half width remains the same @xmath202 to high accuracy in both gyrokinetic and gyrofluid simulations .",
    "it follows that in the small-@xmath96 regime the pressure scale has no influence on the saturation level of the collisionless tearing mode .",
    "+   + a further important nonlinear quantity which has been compared within the adopted gyrokinetic and gyrofluid models is the oscillation frequency @xmath160 that characterizes the saturation phase , as shown in figures  [ fig_nlin1 ] and  [ fig_constpsi_ky1.8_casei ] . in the kinetic context",
    "it was observed that this frequency is due to the bounce motion of trapped electrons in the island  @xcite .",
    "we consider again the parameter cases i and ii , and measure the oscillation frequency as the mean value of several oscillation periods in the deeply nonlinear saturation phase , namely @xmath203 , being @xmath204 the number of periods .    in the gyrofluid simulations the oscillation frequency can always be clearly observed . while for parameters of case i the frequency can be measured clearly with the gyrokinetic code euterpe ,",
    "this is more difficult in case ii .",
    "therefore , to obtain good results the number of markers was doubled to @xmath205 and the previous time step was halfed to @xmath206 .",
    "+ the results are displayed in figure  [ fig_bounce ] .",
    "the models agree very well for all wavenumbers @xmath97 shown here , also for moderate values of @xmath207 .",
    "these results clearly show that also in this regime the oscillatory behaviour of the saturated reconnection process can be described completely by a fluid description .",
    "+ from a rough kinetic estimation one gets @xmath208",
    "@xcite , so the frequency is roughly proportional to the island width and the stability parameter @xmath96 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_drakenlin ] ) .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig_bounce ] confirm this linear scaling in the limit of low @xmath96 values .",
    "this section deals with the extension of previous nonlinear results by including finite ion temperature effects using the full finite larmor radius ( flr ) response .",
    "+ we focus on the parameter case i and investigate the behaviour of the saturated island half width and oscillation frequency with increasing ion temperature .",
    "+    in figure  [ fig_pade_casei ] , left , the saturated island half width is shown when the ion temperature is varied using the values @xmath209 and fixing @xmath210 .",
    "the island width only changes by about 5% over approximately three orders of magnitude of @xmath22 .",
    "this shows that finite larmor radius effects on @xmath159 are weakly relevant for @xmath189 . + as stated earlier , ref .",
    "@xcite predicts the general saturation condition @xmath211 . here , due to the influence of finite ion temperature , the parallel current channel width changes according to  @xcite @xmath212 on the other hand the growth rate increases according to @xmath213 , as we have seen in section [ sec3 ] . using eq .",
    "( [ eq_porc ] ) for the growth rate and eq .",
    "( [ delta_rogers ] ) for the modified current width , the generalized scaling of the saturated island half width for finite @xmath22 becomes @xmath214 as stated for the drift kinetic case .",
    "this estimation makes evident that the saturated island width does not change significantly with ion temperature .",
    "+ in contrast to the island half width , the oscillation frequency changes significantly when the temperature ratio is varied , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig_pade_casei ] .",
    "the dependence of the oscillation frequency on the temperature ratio is similar to that of the growth rate .",
    "however , even with small but finite @xmath215 , the two models agree completely in the saturated phase .",
    "we have simulated collisionless magnetic reconnection via the tearing instability with a gyrokinetic and a gyrofluid model .",
    "the results of both approaches have been compared to each other linearly and nonlinearly for an extended set of parameters . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first comparison of these two models for simulations of the collisionless tearing mode . + as a first step",
    ", we have applied a shooting method to benchmark the linear simulations of both codes in the drift kinetic limit .",
    "the linear eigenmodes of the two models have been benchmarked for a single wave number and a fixed set of plasma parameters , whereas the linear growth rates of both codes have been compared for a range of wave numbers .",
    "it has been shown that in the linear regime both codes give results with high degree of accuracy .",
    "then the results of the two models have been compared over the whole spectrum of linearly unstable wave numbers for two sets of plasma parameters showing a good agreement between the growth rates obtained with the gyrokinetic model and the gyrofluid one .",
    "+ the linear simulations have been extended to the case of finite ion temperature , where we have shown that ion gyro - orbit averaging effects can be properly described by both approaches .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations in the small @xmath216 range compare favorably with the asymptotic theory by porcelli  @xcite . + nonlinear simulations of both models have been carried out in the small-@xmath217 regime .",
    "we have performed a detailed comparison of observables such as the evolution and saturation of the island width , as well as its oscillation frequency in the saturated phase , which has not been performed in this extend of parameter space so far .",
    "the gyrokinetic and gyrofluid simulations have shown that close to the marginal stability the evolution and saturation of the island width for both models is practically the same . moreover ,",
    "an important and new observation is that the oscillation frequency of the island width shows no difference between the two models .",
    "therefore , the main result is that the nonlinear evolution of the collisionless tearing mode in the drift kinetic limit is essentially well described by the fluid theory .",
    "we have also considered finite ion temperature effects in the saturated island phase . here again both models differ only slightly when measuring the island width and its oscillation frequency .",
    "therefore , in the regimes investigated here , the nonlinear reconnection physics can be completely described with a gyrofluid approach .",
    "+ slightly stronger deviations between the simulation results occur for @xmath218 , suggesting that further investigations will be of interest in this regime , as well as in cases where @xmath219 , for which a detailed nonlinear comparison between the gyrokinetic and gyrofluid models is still missing .",
