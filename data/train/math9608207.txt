    "consider now the diffeomorphism type of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath9 is diffeomorphic to @xmath16 , @xmath8 is diffeomorphic to @xmath17 and we can construct @xmath8 from @xmath18 by blowing up 6 points not sitting on the same conic . the curve @xmath11 is the proper transform of a plane curve of degree 6 with 6 ordinary double points in the blowup points so the genus of @xmath11 is 4 .",
    "consider now the diffeomorphism type of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath14 .",
    "it is well - known that a quadric @xmath2 is a hyperboloid ( i.e. diffeomorphic to @xmath19 ) , an ellipsoid ( i.e. diffeomorphic to @xmath20 ) or empty .",
    "it is also well - known that a cubic @xmath8 is diffeomorphic to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath14 is smooth , every component of @xmath14 is diffeomorphic to @xmath24 . note that the embedding of this @xmath24 into @xmath1 is two - sided , the sides of @xmath14 are defined by the sign of polynomial @xmath5 ( since @xmath25 is even ) .",
    "since the genus of @xmath11 is 4 , the harnack inequality implies that the number of components of @xmath14 is at most 5 ( @xmath26 is a connected surface and , therefore , the number of components of its boundary is at most @xmath27 ) .",
    "the topological classification of pairs @xmath28 was done by gudkov @xcite in the case where @xmath2 is a hyperboloid and by gudkov and shustin @xcite in the case where @xmath2 is an ellipsoid ( see @xcite for the classification of flexible curves ) .",
    "this paper gives the topological classification of pairs @xmath29 .",
    "two new phenomena appear in this classification  the arrangement of @xmath14 with respect to the components of @xmath1 in the case when @xmath1 is not connected and the arrangement of the components of @xmath14 with respect to the handles of @xmath1 in the case when @xmath1 is diffeomorphic to a projective plane with handles .",
    "these possibilities for arrangement turn out to be controlled by the degree of the curve .    the topological type of a pair @xmath29 is also called the type of _ topological arrangement _ of @xmath14 in @xmath1 or the _ real scheme _ of @xmath14 in @xmath1 .    a part of the work was done during my stay at the institute for advanced study ( supported by the nsf grant dms 9304580 ) and at the max - planck - institut .",
    "there are two diffeomorphism types of cubic surfaces of positive euler characteristic in @xmath0 : @xmath30 we consider them separately since if @xmath1 is one of these surfaces than any component of @xmath14 bounds a disk in @xmath1 and even the notations for the topological type of @xmath29 are simpler in this case .",
    "recall the system of codes for topological arrangements of a collection of two - sided circles ( or _ ovals _ ) in @xmath31 introduced by viro @xcite .",
    "every oval separates @xmath31 into a disk ( caller the _ interior _ of the oval ) and a mbius band .",
    "two ovals are called _ disjoint _ if their interiors are disjont .",
    "the system of codes is inductive , @xmath32 disjoint ovals are encoded by @xmath33 and if we add a new oval containing a collection @xmath34 in its interior then the code of the new collection is @xmath35 .    to make the same system suitable for encoding of topological arrangements of embedded curves in @xmath20 it suffices to fix a point in @xmath20 in the complement of the curve",
    " then the interior of an oval is defined as the component of the complement of the oval not containing the fixed point .",
    "such a code determines uniquely a topological type of curve in @xmath20 , but because of ambiguity in fixing a point there is more than one code corresponding to the same topological type .",
    "we choose codes minimizing the number of ovals in the interior of other ovals .",
    "to encode types of topological arrangement of @xmath14 into a cubic surface diffeomorphic to @xmath23 we combine systems for @xmath31 and @xmath20 .",
