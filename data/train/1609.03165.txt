    "however , superposition of continuous condensations energized at different times within an unresolved observational element naturally result in a longer condensation lifetime @xcite . in the combined modeling of acceleration ,",
    "transport , and hydrodynamic response in solar flares , @xcite found that the condensation timescale can reach 70@xmath490 s. in the 1d radiative hydrodynamic numerical simulations , @xcite found that the timescales of the electron - driven chromospheric evaporation are 3.5@xmath44 minutes for different cases .    in table",
    "[ tbl-2 ] , we list the timescales of chromospheric condensation and evaporation in the previous literatures . it is revealed that the timescales of evaporation upflows ( 2@xmath420 minutes ) are generally 2@xmath43 times larger than the timescales of condensation downflows ( 1@xmath47 minutes ) . for the c3.1 flare in this study , the condensation timescale is 3@xmath44 minutes , which is consistent with previous findings . to our knowledge ,",
    "the cadence ( 6 s ) of the _ iris _ raster observation is the highest ever for the investigation of chromospheric condensation .    based on the radiative hydrodynamic flare model",
    ", @xcite derived an analytical expression of the peak downflow speed for explosive evaporation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the energy flux and chromospheric density . for the c3.1 flare , @xmath54 km s@xmath3",
    ". taking 10@xmath55 g @xmath56 as the typical value of @xmath53 in the chromosphere , @xmath52 is estimated to be 0.65@xmath510@xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath3 , which is close to the threshold energy flux for explosive evaporation ( @xmath1210@xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the estimated @xmath52 should be a lower limit since the slit positions ( s1 and s2 ) are located at the cfr whose maximum intensity is far less than the ifr and pfrs .",
    "according to the correlation between the intensity and @xmath41 of si iv line in the left panels of figure  [ fig10 ] , the peak downward velocities at the ifr and pfrs should be larger and the nonthermal electron energy flux should be higher .",
    "qpps of solar flares have been extensively observed and reported in various wavelengths .",
    "however , the mechanism of qpps still remains unclear . on one hand",
    ", there are diverse mhd waves ( kink mode and sausage mode ) in the solar atmosphere , such as the slow wave , fast wave , and alfvn wave .",
    "the existence and propagation of waves may modulate the emissions in certain wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic reconnection rate may be modulated by the @xmath57mode wave @xcite , slow - mode wave @xcite , alfvn wave @xcite , fast sausage - mode wave @xcite , and fast kink - mode wave @xcite .",
    "therefore , the acceleration and propagation of electrons in the downward and upward directions would be modulated by the periodic magnetic reconnections @xcite .",
    "besides , the tearing - mode instability and coalescence of magnetic islands occur iteratively , resulting in intermittent magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration @xcite . in a single loop flare on 2005 january 1 , @xcite found qpps of @xmath58-ray emission with a period of @xmath1240 s , which are also present in the hxr and microwave emissions .",
    "they proposed that the qpps are created by periodic magnetic reconnections accompanying particle acceleration triggered by a global kink oscillation in a nearby coronal loop . in an m1.8 flare on 2002",
    "october 20 , @xcite found qpps of both thermal and nonthermal hxr emissions with periods of 16 s and 36 s , which are interpreted in terms of mhd oscillations excited in two interacting systems of flaring loops .    in our study , the qpps with periods of 32@xmath442 s are observed in uv ( si iv @xmath11402.77 ) and sxr derivative .",
    "as described at the beginning of section  [ s - ribb ] , the length of a loop from the null point to the solar surface is estimated to be @xmath1220 mm .",
    "if the qpps are caused by the modulation of magnetic reconnection by fast wave propagating along the fan surface , the phase speed ( @xmath59 ) is estimated to be 950@xmath41250 km s@xmath3 , which is close to the typical value for fast wave in the corona .",
    "hence , the qpps in the c3.1 flare are most probably caused by the modulation of magnetic reconnection , particle acceleration , and subsequent precipitation by fast wave propagating along the fan surface loops .",
    "the nonthermal electrons propagating downward heat the chromosphere and generate evaporation as well as condensation .",
    "therefore , qpps are generated in both uv and sxr during the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "in the x1.6 two - ribbon flare on 2014 september 10 , qpps are observed in multiwavelengths from radio to hxr @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that qpps exist not only in the typical two - ribbon flares , but also in circular - ribbon flares .",
    "the same mechanism may at work in both types .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the influence of the rest wavelength on the results . as mentioned in section  [ s - iris ]",
    ", the spectral profiles of si iv @xmath11402.77 line could not been fitted by a single - gaussian function or double - gaussian function . using the same method",
    "as described in @xcite , we derived the same rest wavelength of si iv line , i.e. , 1402.86@xmath400.0145  .",
    "therefore , our method is reasonable and results are convincing .",
    "the blueshifted doppler velocities of h1 ( see figure  [ fig8](d ) ) may be a signature of gentle chromospheric evaporation due to a very low energy flux of electrons .",
    "however , the blueshifts are too small to draw a solid conclusion .",
    "in this paper , we report our multiwavelength observations of the c3.1 circular - ribbon flare by various instruments on 2015 october 16 .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the flare brightened first at the southwest part .",
    "as time goes on , the area of initial brightening expanded and became more complex , including several patches or kernels .",
    "meanwhile , the narrow eastern part of flare appeared , forming the cfr that encircled the ifr .",
    "apart from the cfr and ifr , there were a pair of short pfrs to the north of ifr , which were most striking in the _",
    "iris_/sji 1400  and 2796  .",
    "for the first time , we observe the circular - ribbon flare in the ca ii h line aboard _",
    "the shape of cfr is similar to that observed in aia 1600  .",
    "2 .   like the c4.2 homologous flare",
    ", this flare was associated with positive polarities and a negative polarity inside in the ar 12434 .",
    "the ifr and cfr were cospatial with the negative polarity and positive polarities , implying the existence of a magnetic null point and dome - like spine - fan topology .",
    "high - cadence ( 6 s ) _ iris _ raster observations show plasma downflow in the si iv line during the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "the doppler velocities increased from a few km s@xmath3 to the peak values of 45@xmath452 km s@xmath3 .",
    "afterwards , the speeds decreased gradually to the initial levels .",
    "the timescales of the chromospheric condensation were 3@xmath44 minutes , indicating ongoing magnetic reconnection .",
    "the doppler velocities of the condensation are positively correlated with the logarithm of the si iv line intensities and time derivative of the sxr flux in 1@xmath48  .",
    "the radio dynamic spectra reveal that the flare was accompanied by a type slowromancap3@ radio burst . combining the correlations and radio burst ,",
    "we conclude that the chromospheric condensation was most probably driven by nonthermal electrons . using the analytical expression in @xcite and the peak downflow speed",
    ", we carried out a diagnostic of energy flux of the precipitated electrons .",
    "a lower limit of the flux is estimated to be 0.65@xmath510@xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath3 .",
    "5 .   during the impulsive phase of the flare , the si iv line intensities and sxr derivative show qpps with periods of 32@xmath442 s. to our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first report of qpps in circular - ribbon flares .",
    "the qpps were most probably caused by intermittent null - point magnetic reconnections modulated by the fast wave propagating along the fan surface loops at a phase speed of 950@xmath41250 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the intermittent acceleration and precipitations of electrons result in periodic heating observed in the si iv line and emissions in sxr .    in the future",
    ", additional case studies using state - of - the - art , multiwavelength observations and mhd numerical simulations are required to figure out the causes of chromospheric condensation and qpps in circular - ribbon flares .",
