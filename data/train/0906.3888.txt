    "with the rapid growth in the wireless networks in the last two decades , the scarcity in spectrum has become a serious problem for spectrum sharing , since much of the prime wireless spectrum has been allocated for specific applications .",
    "however , recent measurements show that the licensed spectrum is severely under - utilized .",
    "this has caused a tremendous interest in using the spectrum dynamically by exploring the empty spaces in the spectrum without disturbing the primary users .",
    "in such systems , in order to avoid the interference to the primary users , it is very important for the cognitive secondary users to detect the activity of the primary users .",
    "when the primary users are active , the secondary user should either avoid using the channel or transmit at low power in order not to exceed the noise power threshold of the primary users , whereas the secondary users can use the channel without any constraints when the channel is free of the primary users .    with the above - mentioned motivation , recent years have witnessed a large body of work on channel sensing and dynamic spectrum sharing . dynamically sharing the spectrum in the time - domain by exploiting whitespace between the bursty transmissions of a set of users , represented by an 802.11b based wireless lan ( wlan ) ,",
    "is considered by the authors in @xcite , where a model that describes the busy and idle periods of a wlan is considered .",
    "the authors in @xcite investigated the problem of maximally utilizing the spectrum opportunities in cognitive radio networks with multiple potential channels , and studied the optimal sensing order problem in multi - channel cognitive medium access control with opportunistic transmission . in their paper @xcite ,",
    "chen _ et al .",
    "_ developed an optimal strategy for opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) by integrating the design of spectrum sensor at the physical layer with that of spectrum sensing and access policies at the medium access control ( mac ) layer , considering the maximization of the throughput of secondary users as the design objective while limiting their collisions with primary users .",
    "the authors in @xcite analyzed the problem of opportunistic access to parallel channels occupied by the primary users under a continuous - time markov chain modeling of the channel occupancy by the primary users , where they proposed a slotted transmission strategy for secondary users using a periodic sensing strategy with optimal dynamic access .",
    "their objective was also to maximize the channel utilization of the secondary users while controlling their interference to the primary users .",
    "introduced a novel wideband spectrum sensing technique , called as multiband joint detection in @xcite , that jointly detects the signal energy levels over multiple frequency bands rather than considering one band at a time , which is proposed to be efficient in improving the dynamic spectrum utilization and reducing interference to the primary users . in @xcite ,",
    "the capacity of opportunistic secondary communication over a spectral pool of two independent channels is explored and it is shown that the benefits of spectral pooling are lost in dynamic spectral environments .    note that spectrum sensing , which is crucial in the detection of the presence of primary users and hence in interference management , also induces a cost in terms of reduced time for data transmission .",
    "motivated by this fact , the authors in @xcite studied the tradeoff between channel sensing and throughput considering the shannon capacity as the throughput metric .",
    "they formulated an optimization problem and identified the optimal sensing time which yields the highest throughput while providing sufficient protection in terms of interference to the primary users .",
    "as described above , issues regarding channel sensing , spectrum sharing and throughput in cognitive radio networks have been extensively studied recently ( see also for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , another critical concern of providing quality of service ( qos ) guarantees over cognitive radio channels has not been sufficiently addressed yet . in many wireless communication systems , providing certain qos assurances is crucial in order to provide acceptable performance and quality . however",
    ", this is a challenging task in wireless systems due to random variations experienced in channel conditions and random fluctuations in received power levels and supported data rates .",
    "hence , in wireless systems , generally statistical , rather than deterministic , qos guarantees can be provided . note that the situation is further exacerbated in cognitive radio channels in which the access to the channel can be intermittent or",
    "transmission occurs at lower power levels depending on the activity of the primary users .",
    "furthermore , cognitive radio can suffer from errors in channel sensing in the form of false alarms .",
    "hence , it is of paramount interest to analyze the performance of cognitive radio systems under qos limitations in the form of delay or buffer constraints .",
    "the maximum throughput levels achieved in wireless systems operating under such statistical qos constraints can be identified through the notion of effective capacity .",
    "the effective capacity is defined in @xcite as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given time - varying service process can support while meeting the qos requirements .",
    "the application and analysis of effective capacity in various settings has attracted much interest .",
    "when both the transmitter and the receiver have the information of the instantaneous channel gains , tang and zhang in @xcite analyzed the effective capacity and derived the optimal power and rate adaptation techniques which maximize the system throughput under qos constraints .",
    "the effective capacity and efficient resource allocation strategies for markov wireless channel models are analyzed by liu _",
    "_ in @xcite where fixed - rate transmission schemes are considered . in this study , the continuous - time gilbert - elliot channel with on and off states",
    "is studied . in @xcite , the energy efficiency under qos constraints",
    "is investigated by analyzing the normalized effective capacity in the low - power and wideband regimes . in this work ,",
    "variable - power / variable - rate and fixed - power / variable - rate transmission schemes are considered assuming the availability of channel side information at both the transmitter and receiver or only at the receiver .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effective capacity of cognitive radio channels in order to identify the performance in the presence of statistical qos constraints .",
    "the secondary users are assumed to initially perform channel sensing to detect the activity of the primary users and then transmit the data at two different average power levels depending on the presence or absence of active primary users .",
    "more specifically , the contributions of this paper are the following :    1 .",
    "we identify a state - transition model for cognitive transmission by comparing the transmission rates with the instantaneous channel capacity values , and incorporating the sensing decision and its correctness into the model .",
    "2 .   we determine the effective capacity of cognitive transmission and provide a tool for the performance analysis in the presence of statistical qos constraints .",
    "we investigate the interactions between the effective capacity , qos constraints , channel sensing duration , channel detection threshold , false alarm and detection probabilities through numerical analysis .",
    "we analyze both fixed - power / fixed - rate transmission schemes and variable schemes by considering different assumptions on the availability of channel side information ( csi ) at the transmitter .",
    "we quantify the performance gains through power and rate adaptation .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : system ] , we describe the cognitive channel model . in section [ sec : sensing ] , we discuss channel sensing and provide expressions for the detection and false alarm probabilities . in section [ sec : transition1 ] , we describe the state transition model for cognitive transmission when the transmitter does not have csi and sends the data at a fixed rate with fixed power , and we determine the effective capacity for this case .",
    "a similar analysis is conducted in section [ sec : transition2 ] but now under the assumption that the transmitter has perfect csi and employs power and rate adaptation .",
    "finally , we provide conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a cognitive radio channel model in which a secondary transmitter attempts to send information to a secondary receiver possibly in the presence of primary users .",
    "initially secondary users perform channel sensing , and then depending on the primary users activity , the secondary transmitter selects its transmission power and rate , i.e. , when the channel is busy , the average power is @xmath0 and the rate is @xmath1 , and when the channel is idle , the average power is @xmath2 and the rate is @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath4 , the secondary transmitter stops transmission in the presence of an active primary user . in the above model ,",
    "the transmission rates @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be fixed or time - varying depending on whether the transmitter has channel side information or not .",
    "moreover , in general we assume @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the data generated by the source is initially stored in the data buffer before being transmitted in frames of duration @xmath8 seconds over the cognitive wireless channel . during transmission ,",
    "the discrete - time channel input - output relation in the @xmath9 symbol duration is given by @xmath10 if the primary users are absent .",
    "on the other hand , if primary users are present in the channel , we have @xmath11 above , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the complex - valued channel input and output , respectively .",
    "we assume that the bandwidth available in the system is @xmath14 and the channel input is subject to the following average energy constraints : @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , when the channel is busy and idle , respectively .",
    "since the bandwidth is @xmath14 , symbol rate is assumed to be @xmath14 complex symbols per second , indicating that the average power of the system is constrained by @xmath0 or @xmath2 . in ( [ input - out1 ] ) and ( [ input - out2 ] ) , @xmath18 denotes the fading coefficient between the cognitive transmitter and the receiver . the fading coefficients can have arbitrary marginal distributions but they are assumed to have finite variances , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "note that , here and throughout the paper , we have denoted the magnitude - square of the fading coefficients by @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we consider a block - fading channel model and assume that the fading coefficients stay constant for a block of duration @xmath8 seconds and change independently from one block to another independently .    in ( [ input - out2 ] ) , @xmath21 represents the sum of the active primary users faded signals arriving at the secondary receiver . in the input - output relations ( [ input - out1 ] ) and ( [ input - out2 ] ) , @xmath22 models the additive thermal noise at the receiver , and",
    "is a zero - mean , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath25 is an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) sequence .",
    "we assume that the first @xmath26 seconds of the frame duration @xmath8 is allocated to sense the channel .",
    "if the transmission strategies of the primary users are not known , energy - based detection methods are well - suited for the detection of the activities of primary users .",
    "the channel sensing can be formulated as a hypothesis testing problem between the noise @xmath22 and the signal @xmath27 in noise .",
    "noting that there are @xmath28 complex symbols in a duration of @xmath26 seconds , this can mathematically be expressed as follows : @xmath29 considering the above detection problem , the optimal neyman - pearson detector is given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the detection threshold .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 has a circularly symmetric complex gaussian distribution with zero - mean and variance @xmath32 .",
    "note that this is an accurate assumption if the signals are being received in a rich multipath environment or the number of active primary users is large .",
    "moreover , if , for instance the primary users are employing phase or frequency modulation , @xmath27 in the presence of even a single primary user in flat rayleigh fading will be gaussian distributed is zero - mean , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian distributed , then so is @xmath33 for any random @xmath34 . ] . assuming further that @xmath35 are i.i.d . , we can immediately conclude that the test statistic @xmath36 is chi - square distributed with @xmath37 degrees of freedom . in this case , the probabilities of false alarm and detection can be established as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the regularized lower gamma function and is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the lower incomplete gamma function and @xmath42 is the gamma function .    in the above hypothesis testing problem , another approach is to consider @xmath36 as gaussian distributed , which is accurate if @xmath28 is large @xcite . in this case , the detection and false alarm probabilities can be expressed in terms of gaussian @xmath43-functions .",
    "we would like to note that the rest of the analysis in the paper does not depend on the specific expressions of the false alarm and detection probabilities .",
    "however , numerical results are obtained using ( [ false alarm ] ) and ( [ eq : probdetect ] ) .",
    "in this section , we assume that the receiver has perfect channel side information ( csi ) and hence perfectly knows the instantaneous values of @xmath44\\}$ ] while the transmitter has no such knowledge .",
    "not knowing the channel conditions , the transmitter sends the information at fixed rates .",
    "more specifically , the transmission rate is fixed at @xmath5 bits / s in the presence of active primary users while the transmission rate is @xmath6 bits / s when the channel is idle . in this section ,",
    "we initially construct a state - transition model for cognitive transmission by considering the cases in which the fixed transmission rates are smaller or greater than the instantaneous channel capacity values , and also incorporating the sensing decision and its correctness .",
    "in particular , if the fixed rate is smaller than the instantaneous channel capacity , we assume that reliable communication is achieved and the channel is in the on state .",
    "otherwise , we declare that outage has occurred and the channel is in the off state .",
    "note that information has to be retransmitted in such a case . in the following ,",
    "we provide a detailed description of the state transition model .",
    "subsequently , we identify , through effective capacity , the maximum throughput that can be achieved in the described state - transition model when the system is subject to qos constraints .      regarding the decision of channel sensing and its correctness , we have the following four possible scenarios :    1 .",
    "channel is busy , detected as busy ( correct detection ) , 2 .",
    "channel is busy , detected as idle ( miss - detection ) , 3 .",
    "channel is idle , detected as busy ( false alarm ) , 4 .",
    "channel is idle , detected as idle ( correct detection ) .    in each scenario",
    ", we have two states , namely on and off , depending on whether or not the fixed - transmission rate exceeds the instantaneous channel capacity . in order to identify these states , we have to first determine the instantaneous channel capacity values .",
    "note that if the channel is detected as busy , the secondary transmitter sends the information with power @xmath45 .",
    "otherwise , it transmits with a larger power , @xmath46 . considering the interference @xmath47 caused by the primary users as additional gaussian noise",
    ", we can express the instantaneous channel capacities in the above four scenarios as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 for @xmath50 denotes the average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) values in each possible scenario .",
    "these snr expressions are @xmath51 note that in scenarios 1 and 3 , the channel is detected as busy and hence the transmission rate is @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transmission rate is @xmath6 in scenarios 2 and 4 . if these fixed rates are below the instantaneous capacity values , i.e. , when @xmath52 or @xmath53 , the cognitive transmission is considered to be in the on state and reliable communication is achieved at these rates . on the other hand , when @xmath54 or @xmath55 , outage occurs and the transmission is in the off state . in this state",
    ", reliable communication is not attained , and hence , the information has to be resent .",
    "it is assumed that a simple automatic repeat request ( arq ) mechanism is incorporated in the communication protocol to acknowledge the reception of data and to ensure that erroneous data is retransmitted .",
    "this state - transition model with 8 states is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] where the labels of the states are placed on the bottom - right corner . in states 1,3,5 , and 7 , the transmission is in the on state , and @xmath56 bits in states 1 and 5 , and @xmath57 bits in states 3 and 7 are transmitted and successfully received seconds .",
    "however , since @xmath26 seconds are allocated to channel sensing , data transmission occurs over a duration of @xmath58 seconds . ] .",
    "the effective transmission rate is zero in the off states .",
    "next , we determine the state - transition probabilities .",
    "we use @xmath59 to denote the transition probability from state @xmath24 to state @xmath60 . due to the block",
    "fading assumption , state transitions occur every @xmath8 seconds . when the channel is busy and detected as busy , the probability of staying in the on state , which is topmost on state in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , is expressed as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 is the prior probability of channel being busy , and @xmath64 is the probability of detection as defined in ( [ eq : probdetect ] ) .",
    "note that is obtained under the assumption that the primary user activity is independent from frame to frame , leading to the expression which depends only on the prior probability @xmath63 .",
    "note further that @xmath65 in general depends on the joint distribution of @xmath66 .",
    "however , since fading changes independently from one block to another in the block - fading model , we can further simplify @xmath65 and write it as @xmath67>\\alpha_{1}\\}=\\rho p_{d}p\\{z>\\alpha_{1}\\}\\ ] ] from which we can immediately see that the transition probability @xmath65 does not depend on the original state . hence , due to the block fading assumption , we can express @xmath68 similarly , the remaining transition probability expressions become @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the false alarm probability .",
    "now , the @xmath74 state transition probability matrix can be expressed as @xmath75       = \\left [      \\begin{array}{ccccc }          p_{1 } & p_{2 } & . & . & p_{8}\\\\          . & . & . & . & .\\\\          . &   . & . & . & .\\\\",

    "we identify the maximum throughput that the cognitive radio channel with the aforementioned state - transition model can sustain under statistical qos constraints imposed in the form of buffer or delay violation probabilities .",
    "wu and negi in @xcite defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that can be supported by a given channel service process while also satisfying a statistical qos requirement specified by the qos exponent @xmath77 .",
    "if we define @xmath43 as the stationary queue length , then @xmath77 is defined as the decay rate of the tail distribution of the queue length @xmath43 : @xmath78 hence , we have the following approximation for the buffer violation probability for large @xmath79 : @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , larger @xmath77 corresponds to more strict qos constraints , while the smaller @xmath77 implies looser constraints . in certain settings , constraints on the queue length can be linked to limitations on the delay and hence delay - qos constraints .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath81 for constant arrival rates , where @xmath82 denotes the steady - state delay experienced in the buffer . in the above formulation",
    ", @xmath83 is a positive constant , @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the source arrival rate .",
    "therefore , effective capacity provides the maximum arrival rate when the system is subject to statistical queue length or delay constraints in the forms of @xmath86 or @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "since the average arrival rate is equal to the average departure rate when the queue is in steady - state @xcite , effective capacity can also be seen as the maximum throughput in the presence of such constraints .",
    "the effective capacity for a given qos exponent @xmath77 is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the time - accumulated service process , and @xmath90 is defined as the discrete - time , stationary and ergodic stochastic service process .",
    "note that the service rate is @xmath91 if the cognitive system is in state 1 or 5 at time @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , the service rate is @xmath93 in states 3 and 7 . in all off states , fixed transmission rates",
    "exceed the instantaneous channel capacities and reliable communication is not possible .",
    "therefore , the service rates in these states are effectively zero .    in the next result",
    ", we provide the effective capacity for the cognitive radio channel and state transition model described in the previous section .",
    "[ theo : fixedrate ] for the cognitive radio channel with the state transition model given in section [ subsec : state ] , the normalized effective capacity in bits / s / hz is given by @xmath94 where @xmath8 is the frame duration over which the fading stays constant , @xmath26 is the sensing duration , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are fixed transmission rates , and @xmath95 for @xmath96 are the transition probabilities expressed in .    _ proof : _ in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the rates supported by the cognitive radio channel with the state transition model described in the previous section can be seen as a markov modulated process and hence the setup considered in @xcite can be immediately applied to our setting .",

    "the average input snr values when the channel is detected correctly are @xmath112 db and @xmath113 db for busy and idle channels , respectively .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the effective capacity is increasing with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "however , at the same time , as @xmath31 increases , the probabilities of false alarm and detection are getting smaller .",
    "for instance , when @xmath116 , the false alarm probabilities start diminishing , which in turn increases the effective capacity values significantly . if @xmath31 is increased beyond 2 , we observe that the detection probabilities start decreasing , causing increasing disturbance to the primary users .",
    "but , since the secondary user assumes that the channel is idle in the case of miss detection and transmits at a higher power level , we again see an increase in the effective capacity .",
    "therefore , this increase occurs at the cost of increased interference to the primary users , which can be limited by imposing a lower bound on the detection probability . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we further observe that as the duration of channel sensing @xmath26 increases , the false alarm and detection probabilities decrease with sharper slopes . on the other hand ,",
    "we note that having a larger @xmath26 decreases the effective capacity outside the range of @xmath31 values at which transitions in the false alarm and detection probabilities occur .",
    "this is due to the fact that as @xmath26 increases , less time is available for data transmission . finally , we remark that if the threshold value @xmath31 is taken between 1.2 and 1.7 , the probabilities of false alarm and detection are 0 and 1 , respectively , and the channel effective capacity is approximately 0.052 bits / sec / hz .",
    "such a favorable situation arises because of the large number of samples @xmath28 used for channel sensing .",

    "the input snr values are the same as the ones used in the previous figures and @xmath114 .",
    "we observe that when @xmath118 and hence the threshold is small , both the false alarm and detection probabilities are high .",
    "since false alarms happen frequently , effective capacity is small and gets smaller with increasing @xmath26 . on the other hand , if @xmath119 , false alarm and detection probabilities are low and decrease with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the secondary transmitter frequently assumes that the channel is idle and transmits with high power . as a result ,",
    "the effective capacity is high .",
    "however , as remarked before , high interference is caused to the primary users .",
    "we further note that the effective capacity achieves its maximum value at @xmath120 above which it starts decreasing as less time is allocated to data transmission .",

    "below , we specify the instantaneous capacity values and the corresponding rates used by the transmitter in each possible scenario : @xmath128 where snr expressions are the same as those defined in . note that , in contrast to the analysis in section [ subsec : state ] , we in this section have only one state ( either on or off ) for each scenario .",
    "if the channel is detected as busy , the secondary transmitter sends the data at the instantaneous rate @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the power adaptation policy in this case . depending on the channel s true state being busy or idle ( scenarios 1 or 3 above ) ,",
    "@xmath131 is either equal to the instantaneous channel capacity as in scenario 1 or less than that as in scenario 3 .",
    "hence , in both cases , reliable transmission can be attained at the rate of @xmath131 , and the channels are on .",
    "when the channel is detected as idle , the data transmission rate is @xmath132 if the channel is actually idle , @xmath133 is equal to the instantaneous channel capacity , and therefore the channel is in the on state as in scenario 4 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the channel is busy but detected as idle as in scenario 2 above , @xmath133 is greater than the channel capacity because the transmitter does not take into account the interference caused by the primary users .",
    "hence , this becomes the only case in which the channel is in the off state .",
    "similarly as before , we assume that outage occurs in this state and reliable transmission can not be provided .",
    "the information has to be resent with the assistance of an arq mechanism .    in summary , we have three on states and one off state under the assumptions of this section .",
    "these states correspond to states 1 , 4 , 5 , and 7 of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "therefore , the state transition model in this section can be obtained by keeping these states and eliminating states 2 , 3 , 6 , and 8 in the state - transition model in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "note that as another major difference from the state - transition model in section [ subsec : state ] , the transmission rates in each state are now random processes . therefore ,",
    "in this new model , the state - transition probabilities depend only on the detection probabilities and the prior probability of channel being busy , @xmath63 .",
    "these probabilities can be expressed as @xmath134 for @xmath135 and 7 .",
    "the following result provides the effective capacity expression when the transmitter , having perfect csi , employs rate and power adaptation during transmission .",
    "[ theo : variableratepower ] for the cognitive radio channel with power and rate adaptation at the transmitter and with the state transition model described in section [ subsec : state1 ] , the normalized effective capacity in bits / s / hz is given by @xmath136 \\label{maximized}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expectations are with respect to @xmath137 , and @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "_ proof _ : the proof is very similar to the proof of theorem [ theo : fixedrate ] .",
    "the only differences are that we now have four states and the service processes ( or equivalently the transmission rates ) are random processes that depend on @xmath137 . as described in section [ subsec : state1 ] , the rates are @xmath131 in states 1 and 5 , @xmath133 in state 7 , and zero in state 4 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding moment generating functions are @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , where the expectations are with respect to @xmath137 .",
    "using the same approach as in the proof of theorem [ theo : fixedrate ] , we can easily find that @xmath143 combining the expression in with , and maximizing over all possible power adaptation schemes leads to .",
    "@xmath109    having obtained the expression for the effective capacity , we now derive the optimal power adaptation strategies that maximize the effective capacity .",

    "@xmath147 and @xmath148 are the threshold values in the power adaptation policies and they can be found from the average power constraints in ( [ mu ] ) through numerical techniques .    _",
    "proof : _ since logarithm is a monotonic function , the optimal power adaptation policies can also be obtained from the following minimization problem @xmath149 it is clear that the objective function in ( [ objective ] ) is strictly convex and the constraint functions in ( [ mu ] ) are linear with respect to @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",

    ", we obtain optimal power policies given in ( [ mu1 ] ) and ( [ mu2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath109    the optimal power allocation schemes identified in theorem [ theo : optimalpower ] are similar to that given in @xcite . however , in the cognitive radio channel , we have two allocation schemes depending on the presence or absence of active primary users .",
    "note that the optimal power allocation in the presence of active users , @xmath122 , has to be performed under a more strict average power constraint since @xmath157 .",
    "note also that under certain fading conditions , we might have @xmath158 , causing more interference to the primary users .",
    "therefore , it is also of interest to apply only rate adaptation and use fixed - power transmission in which case we have @xmath159 .",
    "we can immediately see from the result of theorem [ theo : variableratepower ] that the effective capacity of fixed - power / variable - rate transmission is @xmath160\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 and @xmath162 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , we plot the effective capacities of the three transmission schemes , namely , fixed - power / fixed - rate transmission ( solid line ) , variable - power / variable - rate transmission ( dashed - line ) , and fixed - power / variable - rate transmission ( dotted - line ) , discussed heretofore in the paper , as a function of the detection threshold @xmath31 .",
    "we note that the optimal power adaptation is employed in the variable - power scheme . in this figure ,",
    "all the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] discussed in section [ sec : transition1 ] .",
    "hence , @xmath163 .",
    "when we compare variable - rate / variable - power and variable - rate / fixed - power schemes , we immediately notice , as expected , that variable - rate / variable - power outperforms the latter one for all @xmath31 values .",
    "however , the difference in the effective capacity values reduces as @xmath31 is increased beyond @xmath1642 where detection probability starts diminishing .",
    "additionally , we observe that for @xmath165 , fixed - rate / fixed - power scheme starts outperforming the variable schemes .",
    "note that when the detection probability is small , miss - detections occur frequently . in variable schemes ,",
    "recall that the transmission enters the off state in cases of miss - detection in which the channel is detected as idle but is actually busy , and hence a degradation in the performance is expected .",
    "this is also the reason for why the effective capacity of the variable schemes is decreasing for @xmath31 values greater than 1.5 where the detection probability has also started getting smaller than 1 .",
    "note that this is in stark contrast to the behavior exhibited by the fixed - rate / fixed - power scheme .",
    "we finally note that the variable schemes perform better than the fixed - rate / fixed - power transmission when the detection probabilities are relatively high ( or equivalently when @xmath166 ) , and also as before , an decrease in the false alarm probability increases the rates .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] plots the effective capacities of different transmission schemes as a function of the qos exponent @xmath77 under the assumption of perfect channel detection i.e. , the probability of false alarm is 0 and the probability of detection is 1 .",
    "as expected , effective capacity values are decreasing with increasing @xmath77 values .",
    "since the plot is obtained under perfect channel sensing , the transmission strategy with variable power and rate outperforms the other two schemes for all @xmath77 values .",
