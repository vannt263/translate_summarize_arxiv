    "the localization of quantum particles and waves in disordered media has been a key theme common to several fields of physics since anderson s prediction of the effect half a century ago @xcite . among the different setups",
    "leading to localization effects , quasiperiodic potentials with incommensurate periods @xcite provide a particularly attractive realization , as their mathematical simplicity allows for various exact results .",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system subject to such a quasiperiodic potential ( aubry - andre potential @xcite ) has a localization transition at a finite value of the potential strength , in contrast to a random potential which in 1d causes localization at infinitesimal strength .",
    "recently , pioneering experiments have explored the physics of bosons @xcite and light @xcite in such potentials .",
    "the single - particle spectrum acquires additional structure upon modification of the quasiperiodic superlattice potentials e.g. , when there are two superlattice potentials with different wavelengths each incommensurate with the lattice , or by other modifications of the basic aubry - andre ( aa ) potential @xcite . in these cases , different energy regions of the single - particle spectrum might become localized at different strengths of the potential , so that at some strengths of the potential there are both localized and delocalized eigenstates . such a structure is known as a _ mobility edge _ @xcite .",
    "mobility edges are well - known to exist in truly random potentials , but only in higher dimension .",
    "the interplay between disorder and interactions is a prominent theme in the study of strongly correlated systems . with the realization of quasiperiodic potentials hosting bosonic atoms @xcite",
    ", a natural question is the behavior of interacting bosons in quasiperiodic potentials",
    "@xcite have studied the bose - hubbard model in the aa potential for nonzero interactions . some of these works @xcite have used the infinite - interaction or hard - core limit of the bose - hubbard model , where multiple occupancies are disallowed .",
    "the hard - core boson ( hcb ) model can be mapped onto free fermions , allowing numerically exact calculations for relatively large system sizes even in the absence of translation symmetry .",
    "ground state , finite - temperature , and non - equilibrium properties of hard - core bosons in the aa potential have been analyzed in some detail in these studies @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we address ground - state and non - equilibrium properties of hard - core bosons in multi - chromatic quasiperiodic potentials ( extended aubry - andre models ) where the single - particle spectrum displays mobility edges .",
    "our main result concerning equilibrium properties is a connection between the behavior of the many - body system ( insulating or quasi - condensate ) and the location of the fermi energy of the corresponding free - fermion system ( which is the chemical potential for both the corresponding free - fermion system and for the hcb )",
    ". the system acts like a quasi - condensate ( or insulator ) when the chemical potential is in an energy region where the single - particle states are extended ( or localized ) , irrespective of the nature of single - particle states lying below the chemical potential .",
    "this phenomenon is particularly puzzling in the case where the chemical potential is in a localized region but there are filled extended states at lower energies .",
    "one would expect superfluid properties due to extended states being occupied .",
    "we demonstrate this remarkable property , that the system behavior is determined by the location of the chemical potential , through the study of various quantities ( quasi - condensate fraction scaling , off - diagonal order , entanglement entropy , etc ) .",
    "we also study the dynamics after release of an initially trapped cloud of hard - core bosons in multi - chromatic potentials .",
