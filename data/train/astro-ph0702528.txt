    "the lmxb her x-1/hz her shows periodicities on very different time scales . the spin period of the neutron star is 1.24 sec , the orbit lasts 1.7 days and the 35 day cycle corresponds to the precession of the warped accretion disk in the tidal field of the companion .",
    "the binary system shows a high inclination of more than 80 deg , and therefore the disk covers the neutron star for the observer temporarily during the 35 day precession , resulting in strong variations of the x - ray signal .",

    "this is supported by a strong correlation between the duration of the precession cycle and changes in the spin - up rate where the latter is due to variations of the angular momentum transfer rate ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) .",
    "we suggest a physical explanation within the framework of the coronal wind model ( schandl & meyer 1994 ) and/or the stream - disk model by shakura et al .",

    "pulse periods were regularly measured by batse onboard of cgro . we have made use of the publically distributed pulsar data as well as lists kindly provided by r. wilson , and data from our own pointed rxte observations ( e.g. stelzer et al .",

    "1 ( top ) . the average spin- up trend dp / dt before day 1150 amounts to @xmath09 ns / day , but with clear deviations , including episodes of spin - down .",
    "a dramatic spin - down event happened around day 1150 , associated with the third historical anomalous low period ( al  3 ) .",
    "her x-1 shows a 35 day flux modulation supposedly due to the occultation of the ns by a precessing warped accretion disk .",
    "turn - ons , the rise of the x - ray signal towards the main - on , are observed since the discovery of her x-1 in 1972 ( tananbaum et al .",
    "our historical data set is based on staubert et al .",
    "additionally , we determined turn - ons from the occultation and pulsed flux data of batse and from the rxte all sky monitor .",
    "these data were taken from the heasarc archive at nasa / gsfc .",
    "details of the determination of the turn - on times and a complete list of turn - ons will be given in staubert et al .",
    "the fluctuations of the turn - on times can be expressed by the `` ( o@xmath5c)''-diagram ( fig .  1 , lower panel ) , which shows the difference between the observed turn - on time and the calculated turn - on time assuming a model 35day period equal to 20.5 p@xmath4 ( positive values correspond to turn - ons which are observed later than the calculated one ) .",
    "the mean general spin - up of the neutron star ( @xmath09nsec / d ) is modified by significant structure : most apparent are four periods of extended spin - down .",
    "these events happen over a time scale of about 2000 days and occur near the times of extended periods of low flux ( so called anomalous lows , al ) , as marked by the rectangles in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition , there are deviations on shorter time scales ( a few hundred days ) which are of quasi - periodic nature ( on time scales of 400600 days , see fig .  3 ) .    the ( o@xmath5c)-diagram is a representation of the history of the 35day period .",
    "it appears from fig .",
    "1 that on the longest time scale the average period is consistent with 20.5 times the binary period , a prediction made 22 years ago by staubert et al .",
    "( 1983 ) when only the first increasing leg in the ( o@xmath5c)-diagram was known .",
    "individual 35day cycles ( from one turn - on to the next ) are either 20 , 20.5 or 21 times the binary period , with a few cycles with 19.5 times the binary period just before the onset of anomalous lows and probably several inside the dramatic al  3 ( see below ) .    figs .",
    "1 and 2 show that the large features in the development of the pulse period and in the ( o@xmath5c ) diagram are highly correlated .",
    "the following global features appear simultaneously : ( 1 ) _ maxima in pulse period residuals ( ppr ) _ , corresponding to ( relative ) spin - down , ( 2 ) _ minima in ( o@xmath5c ) _ ( going into the minimum means a short turn - on period ) , ( 3 ) the _ appearance of anomalous lows _ around these extrema .",
    "these global features repeat about every 5 years , with large differences in relative strength and duration and with quite some jitter in the timing .",
    "extrema in ( o@xmath5c ) mean that the average 35day period changes its value ( it increases coming out of a minimum , and decreases after a maximum ) .",
    "the most dramatic event is al  3 in 1999 ( around jd-2440000=1150 ) .",
    "the most likely average period during al  3 was about 33.4days . since the start of the observations in 1971 ,",
    "some anomalous lows have apparently been missed because of poor sampling and/or intrinsic weakness or shortness .",
    "there are , however , also _ clear correlations on shorter time scales _",
    "( a few hundred days ) , as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "we note that this kind of correlation has been seen earlier by bochkarev et al .",
    "( 1981 ) and by gelman et al .",
    "( 1985 ) on the basis of smaller sets of data . the data in fig .",
    "3 are due to the dense sampling by batse on cgro .",
    "they provide clear evidence for a time lag between the pulse period evolution and the ( o@xmath5c ) evolution , as already noted by staubert et al .",
    "a formal cross - correlation of the pulse period residuals and the ( o@xmath5c ) data finds that the ( o@xmath5c ) curve must be shifted to earlier times by @xmath035days to reach maximum correlation , meaning that any developments with time are seen first in the pulse period and then in the timing of turn - on of the next 35day cycle .",
    "( we note that the formal lag value of @xmath6days must not be over - interpreted , since the resolution of the ( o@xmath5c ) data is , by definition , 35days .",
    "so the likely physical lag is of the order of a few tens of days ) .",
    "the changes in pulse period are due to transfer of angular momentum to the neutron star .",
    "since the latter should be positively correlated to the mass accretion rate , one might expect to also see a correlation between the pulse period residuals and x - ray flux . while there is some evidence for this ( wilson et al .",
    "1997 , staubert et al .",
    "2000 , still & boyd  2004 ) , the case is not overwhelming and needs further attention ( it will be discussed in staubert et al .  2006 ) .",
    "further observational parameters are the spectral hardness ( still & boyd  2004 ) and the pulse shape ( postnov et al .",
    "a detailed discussion and comparison with models of inclined and warped accretion disks is not possible here .",
    "this will appear in staubert et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . here",
    "we note that the observed bahavior is consistent both with the coronal wind model by schandl & meyer ( 1994 ) as well as with the stream - disk interaction model by shakura et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . under both models",
    "we assume that the motor for the apparent variability is the optical companion which provides more or less material at the inner lagrangian point .",
    "the average mass accretion rate of the ns is such that the system operates close to the equilibrium period with a slight bias towards spin - up . when the mass accretion rate drops also the spin - up rate drops and may even turn to spin - down , in accordance with standard accretion theory ( ghosh & lamb  1997 ) . the consequences for the observable turn - on times are as observed : within the framework of the coronal wind model ( schandl & meyer1994 ) the reduced x - ray irradiation of the outer parts of the disk reduces the coronal wind and its torque on the accretion disk leading to a generally less inclined disk .",
    "this in turn leads to a faster precession of the disk .",
    "anomalous lows are observed when the disks inclination is very small and the view onto the ns is blocked . within the stream - disk model reduced mass transfer means weaker dynamical action on the disk by the gas stream leading again to a less inclined disk with faster precession . for both models",
    "we expect that the ns feels any change in mass transfer first and the response of the accretion disk is delayed by its viscous time scale ( a few tens of days )  as observed .    while the short - term behaviour of the discussed observables in her  x-1 are subject to considerable noise in the system , we now believe that the global long - term developments are not due to a random walk ( as proposed by staubert et al .  1983 ) but rather due to two physical reasons : ( 1 ) the optical companion provides _ quasi - periodic variations in mass transfer _ and ( 2 ) the ns itself - through its possible _ free precession _ ( ketsaris et al .",
    "2000 ) - provides a stable internal clock , forcing the precession of the disk to stay close to the ns frequency over long time scales , despite the variable forces acting on the disk .",
    "the changing mass transfer rate may be due to changing illumination of the optical companion by the x - ray beam . in this sense",
    "the apparent 5  year period could be associated with a limit cycle due to a positive feedback in the binary system .",
