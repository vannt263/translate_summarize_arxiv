    "one of the most important goals in the application of physics to finance  @xcite and in risk management , is to model accurately financial time series .",
    "+ indeed physicists have become more involved in the study of financial systems and financial time series , among all complex systems , due to the huge amount of available data in electronic format , a situation that makes easier to check paradigms and theories . +",
    "on the other hand , practitioners working in finance need to understand financial time series in order to : ( i ) assess correctly the market risk associated to portfolios and ( ii ) make a more rational price evaluation of derivative products , a task where the knowledge of stochastic process followed by the underlying asset is a key element .",
    "( e.g. the largely accepted black ",
    "scholes formula for option pricing  @xcite is based on the gaussian hypothesis for asset returns .",
    "moreover many attempts to justify smiles in implied volatility structures are based to alternative dynamics for price variations  @xcite . )",
    "+ the modelling of financial time series started at the beginning of the 20th century . in a pioneering work , bachelier showed that stock price fluctuations could be modelled as a random walk ( i.e. a brownian motion )  @xcite .",
    "indeed more accurate analyses of financial data have shown that geometric brownian motion is inadequate to describe correctly empirical distributions when large events occur  @xcite . in order to account for fat tails in empirical data , mandelbrot , in his 1963 paper , proposed to model financial time series through a levy stable process  @xcite .",
    "more recently mantegna and stanley pointed out that a levy flight distribution is an accurate description only for the central part of the distribution of returns while for the extreme tails an exponential fitting is more appropriated ; in particular they suggested that the distribution of price changes is consistent with a truncated lvy flight distribution  @xcite .",
    "+ other empirical investigations considered the time evolution of volatility ( i.e. the second moment of price returns distribution )  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of high frequency data has shown that two different regimes take place : a super - diffusive behaviour for short time intervals ( where volatility scales with time as @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and a regime close to diffusive behaviour ( @xmath2 ) for long times ( see  @xcite , par .",
    "clearly the standard geometric brownian motion does indeed account only for a diffusive regime .",
    "+ the discussions made above concern the univariate case , where only a single financial time series is considered .",
    "the extension of the one - dimensional brownian motion to a set of @xmath3 assets is the so - called multivariate geometric brownian motion .",
    "today most of the analyses in risk management are based on this model , in spite of its limitations  @xcite . within the multivariate brownian motion the cross - correlations between stocks are supposed to be constant and independent from market activity .",
    "indeed empirical evidence has shown that correlations between stocks are strictly dependent from market volatility and increase sharply during turmoil  @xcite , a phenomenon called correlation breakdown .",
    "moreover it has been demonstrated that a couple of correlated series , following a geometric brownian motion , are asymptotically independent ( i.e. extreme events occur independently )  @xcite .",
    "this means that the covariate model is unable to describe the correlation structure of extreme returns .",
    "all these facts have serious consequences on risk management  @xcite .",
    "in fact , if we use a covariate model to estimate the market risk ( i.e. the risk due to unexpected variations of market conditions ) of a portfolio of stocks , we under - estimate the probability of simultaneous losses and consequently under - estimate the possible portfolio claims . on the other hand , from a theoretical point of view , in recent years",
    "an increasing attention has been devoted to the study of ensembles of stocks traded in the same financial market  @xcite , with an emphasis on correlation structure characterization  @xcite .",
    "starting from this context , we introduce a new model for a set of stocks that aims to encompass in a unitary picture some of the most important features of financial time series , that is : time evolution of volatility , fat tails and correlation structure . for this model",
    "we show that a super - diffusive process characterizes the time scaling of volatility for intermediate time intervals ( with a critical exponent 3/4 ) while a standard diffusive regime takes place for long times ( par .",
    "[ subsection : power_law ] ) . in paragraph",
    "[ subsection : fat_tails ] we discuss how fat tails can emerge in the system . in paragraph",
    "[ subsection : correlation ] a monte carlo simulation approach is used to investigate the correlation structure of the model . finally section  [ section : conclusions ] is devoted to discuss briefly some conclusions .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , one of the most interesting characteristics of financial markets is the increase of cross - correlations when large market events occur .",
    "empirical evidence shows that for large market returns almost 90% of the equities have the same sign as that of the market  @xcite . in other words during market crisis or running days",
    "most of stocks follow the general trend .",
    "this suggests that the probability for an individual stock to have a positive ( negative ) return can be affected by a market increase ( decrease ) . basing on this consideration we introduce a one step model for an ensemble of @xmath3 equities , @xmath4 , where each stock movement , @xmath5 , follows a quasi random walk , with a hopping probability , @xmath6 , depending on the previous market return .",
    "precisely : @xmath7 where : @xmath8 is the normalized market return , @xmath9 is the time required to complete one step and @xmath10 is a function such that @xmath11 .",
    "( to simplify the formulas in the following we have chosen @xmath12 and @xmath13 . )",
    "+ the factor 1/2 , in equation  ( [ eq : basic_equation_p ] ) , represents the usual random walk contribution ( i.e. a 50% chance to perform a positive or a negative step ) . the function @xmath10 incorporates the typical trader strategy : when market blows up some traders ( the bulls ) assume that the market will continue to rise ( this behaviour is modelled by imposing the following condition on @xmath10 : @xmath14 ) . on the opposite hand other agents will consider this positive trend a good opportunity to realise a profit by selling their positions ( thus we require that @xmath15 for @xmath16 )",
    "finally , a rising market reflects into an upward general tendency for the stocks belonging to that market ( as in crash periods most of equities drop dramatically as the market does ) ; hence @xmath10 must have the same sign of @xmath17 .",
    "+ since for large @xmath3 the normalized market return , @xmath17 , is expected to be small compare to 1 , it turns out that :    * the function @xmath10 , satisfying all the above constraints , can be well approximated as : @xmath18 * @xmath10 , in eq .  ( [ eq : basic_equation_p ] ) , is indeed a correction respect to the random walk contribution .",
    "some considerations can be made on the model defined above .",
    "first of all we observe that the model ( with the choice  ( [ eq : function_g ] ) ) contains a symmetry between upward and downward movements .",
    "actually , as pointed out in the literature ( see for instance  @xcite ) , the increase of correlations for large market events is thought to be asymmetric , with a stronger interlink dependence between equities during crash periods .",
    "indeed , it is very simple to incorporate this feature in our model by considering two different values of @xmath19 : a @xmath20 for upward moves and a lower value , @xmath21 , for downward moves .",
    "however in order to simplify the analysis we maintain @xmath22 .",
    "+ secondly , from a heuristic point of view the model proposed has a strong analogy with a critical ising model in infinite dimensions , it is therefore not surprising that critical ( i.e. power law ) behaviours can emerge .",
    "+ finally , it is clear that the model we have introduced is quite schematic : we treat all the equities on the same foot and apart from correlations induced by the market growth ( see par .",
    "[ subsection : correlation ] ) , no explicit correlations are considered .",
    "however we can expect that a more complete model would maintain the basic features we are going to discuss .",
    "in this section we present , relatively to our model , some results regarding fat tails and correlation structures .",
    "we resort to analytical calculations ( paragraphs  [ subsection : market_return ] and  [ subsection : power_law ] ) as well as monte carlo simulations ( par .",
    "[ subsection : correlation ] ) .      the model discussed in the previous section , can be regarded as a system of @xmath3 random walkers with a hopping probability depending on the previous mean hopping .",
    "+ if we indicate with @xmath23 the probability to find a generic walker at site @xmath24 , after a time @xmath25 , when the mean hopping at time @xmath26 is @xmath17 , then the time evolution master equation for @xmath27 is given by : @xmath28 \\ , ,   \\label{eq : master_prob_equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where : @xmath29^ { n \\frac{1+\\tilde m}{2 } }   \\ , \\big [ p_{\\delta s =- s}(m ) \\big]^ { n \\frac{1-\\tilde m}{2 } } \\ ; , \\label{eq : g_definition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 obeying to the initial condition : + @xmath30 .",
    "+ interestingly , @xmath31 can be regarded as a sort of transition matrix from a state characterized by a market return @xmath17 to a state @xmath32 .",
    "+ the probability distribution of market returns over a time horizon of one step is given by @xmath33 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : master_prob_equation ] ) , it follows that : @xmath34 after a transient period , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0 ] ) converges to a stationary state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : market_return_distribution ] , the solution obtained by solving numerically the eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0 ] ) is presented ( solid line ) +    an analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0 ] ) can be worked out , in the limit of large @xmath3 , by approximating the operator @xmath35 through differential operators .",
    "indeed by using the stirling formula and considering the taylor expunction of @xmath36 at the second order in @xmath37 , it is possible to show that : @xmath38 +   \\frac{1}{2n } & & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tilde m^2 }   \\left [ \\left(1-\\tilde m^2\\right ) f(\\tilde m ) \\right ] \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : g_approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the above approximation holds in the limit of large @xmath3 and under the following restrictions on the generic function @xmath36 :    @xmath39    @xmath40    [ eq : g_approx_validity ]    setting @xmath41 and substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_approx ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0 ] ) , we obtain a second order differential equation for @xmath42 ; its analytical solution is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes a constant such that @xmath45 .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the above solution satisfies , for @xmath46 , both conditions  ( [ eq : g_approx_validity ] ) . as a definitive check we compare , in figure  [ fig : market_return_distribution ] , the probability distribution of market returns obtained with different methodologies , that is : ( i ) by solving numerically the exact equation  ( [ eq : p0 ] ) ; ( ii ) by using the analytical expression  ( [ eq : p0_analytical ] ) and ( iii ) by resorting to a monte carlo simulation .",
    "all the three curves are quite close ( the analytical and the exact solutions are almost indistinguishable ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the analytical solution  ( [ eq : p0_analytical ] ) with the corresponding expression for a set of @xmath3 independent equities .",
    "in such a case the market return is the sum of @xmath3 uncorrelated variables assuming the values @xmath47 . by applying the central limit theorem",
    ", the probability distribution of market variations turns out to be the usual gaussian function : @xmath48 as one can realise immediately , the market volatility , @xmath49 , computed from the above probability distribution , scales with @xmath3 as @xmath50 , in contrast with our model where @xmath51 .",
    "this means that the inter - dependence among equities has the effect to maintain the market volatility still very large even for large value of @xmath3 . as a consequence",
    "the extreme market price movements in our model happen far more often than would be expected by chance .",
    "this characteristic is one of the statistical properties of real financial indexes pointed out in literature  @xcite .",
    "the volatility of a single stock over a horizon @xmath25 , @xmath52 , ( which , in our model , is indeed the same for all equities ) is given by : @xmath53 .",
    "+ by using the eq .",
    "( [ eq : master_prob_equation ] ) , it turns out that @xmath52 satisfies the following finite - difference equation :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 must obey to : @xmath56 with the initial condition @xmath57 .",
    "+ [ eq : volatility_diff_eq ]    note that if we substitute to the matrix @xmath31 its approximated expression  ( [ eq : g_approx ] ) and represent the finite difference @xmath58 by a time derivative , the equation  ( [ eq : volatility_diff_eq_2 ] ) reduces to a fokker ",
    "planck equation with a drift @xmath59 and a diffusion coefficient @xmath60 ( the factor @xmath61 can be always re - adsorbed by redefining @xmath62 , for an appropriate function @xmath63 ) .",
    "+ regarding the time evolution equation of volatility  ( [ eq : volatility_diff_eq_1 ] ) , the first contribution represents the usual diffusive process while the second term is originated by the influence of market trend on stock returns .",
    "if this last term has a power law time dependence @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) then the stock volatility is characterized by a super - diffusive process .",
    "+ in order to investigate the time scaling behaviour of equations  ( [ eq : volatility_diff_eq ] ) , we set @xmath66 . substituting  ( [ eq : g_approx ] ) into  ( [ eq : volatility_diff_eq_2 ] ) , the equation for @xmath67 reads : @xmath68 interestingly , we note that the analysis of the finite - difference version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pde_h ] ) shows that @xmath69 can be always expressed as a finite sum of the form @xmath70 .",
    "now it is simple to prove that @xmath71 fulfil the conditions  ( [ eq : g_approx_validity ] ) only for @xmath72 and therefore we can expect that @xmath69 satisfies the relations  ( [ eq : g_approx_validity ] ) only in the range of times @xmath25 such that @xmath73 . hence the partial differential equation ( pde )  ( [ eq : pde_h ] ) can be regarded as a good approximation for the evolution of @xmath67 only for @xmath74 . as a result",
    "the time evolution of @xmath52 is characterized by three regimes :    * @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 satisfies the pde  ( [ eq : pde_h ] ) .",
    "the long time scaling behaviour of @xmath67 is investigated in appendix  [ section : appendix ] .",
    "precisely , it can be proved that if @xmath77 then @xmath78 and therefore @xmath79 .",
    "in such a case the system is characterized by a super - diffusive process .",
    "note that the critical exponent 3/4 is quite close to the empirical result of 0.8 reported in literature ( see  @xcite , par .",
    "7.1 ) . * @xmath25 comparable to @xmath80",
    ". the pde  ( [ eq : pde_h ] ) fails in describing the time evolution of @xmath67 .",
    "the numerical solution of equation  ( [ eq : volatility_diff_eq_2 ] ) shows that @xmath81 converges towards a stationary state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : volatility_time_evol ] ) . as a consequence @xmath82 and",
    "therefore the super - diffusive scaling behaviour breaks down ; * an intermediate regime between the two , where volatility scales faster than @xmath83 but without a sharp power law behaviour .",
    "the behaviour reported above for the time evolution of volatility is indeed typical of financial time series ( see  @xcite , par .",
    "7.1 ) .      using the above results we can have some insights on the presence of fat tails in the probability distribution of stock price returns .",
    "indeed , we can expect that for @xmath3 sufficiently large , most of the time the market growth , @xmath17 , is relatively small ( from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0_analytical ] ) @xmath84 ) and therefore the majority of stocks follow a geometric brownian motion ( @xmath85 ) . on the other hand during extreme market movements ( crashes or running days ) , the walkers have a higher probability , respect to a simple random walk , to move far from the origin ( extreme events ) . therefore is reasonable to imagine that the central part of the stock price variations distribution is approximately near to a standard gaussian distribution while for the tails a fatter non - gaussian shape is expected . indeed",
    "the results of subsection  [ subsection : power_law ] show that the stock volatility grows faster than the brownian term @xmath86 ( at least until @xmath25 is of order @xmath87 ) .",
    "this is coherent with the hypothesis of fat tails in the distribution of stock returns , which indeed provide an extra - contribution to the volatility growth . since the time evolution of volatility reaches a standard diffusive behaviour for @xmath25 comparable to @xmath87 ( as indicated by the numerical simulation reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : volatility_time_evol ] ) we can suppose that also fat tails would disappear on long time scales , reducing the process to a pure gaussian stochastic random walk .",
    "this is in accordance with the empirical evidence observed in financial time series , where a crossover between a leptokurtic distribution for short times and a gaussian behaviour for long time intervals takes place@xcite .",
    "as we have seen in the introduction , ensembles of stocks are characterized by an increase of correlations during critical periods .",
    "this behaviour is qualitatively well reproduced within our model .",
    "+ in figures  [ fig : cond_probab_sign ] and  [ fig : corr ] , some monte carlo results are given . +    specifically , in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_probab_sign ] , we present the conditional probability for stocks to have the same sign as that of the market .",
    "the results show a strong sign dependence as a function of the market return .",
    "interestingly , that dependence increases further considering larger time horizons ( compare curve a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_probab_sign ] ) . on the other hand , for a set of uncorrelated stocks ,",
    "the sign conditional probability is substantially weaker ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cond_probab_sign ] ) and remains stable increasing time .",
    "+ the above results are consistent with the empirical observations reported by bouchaud et al  @xcite .",
    "they consider a set of 450 u.s .",
    "equities , obtaining the same shape of fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_probab_sign ] , with a 90% of the stocks have the same sign as that of the market return for very large market movements . + figure  [ fig : corr ] clearly shows that correlations between stocks are enforced during high - volatility periods . indeed in a one step model for an ensemble of @xmath3 stocks , it is always true that the mean stocks cross - correlation , @xmath88 , is related to market variance , @xmath89 ( over a horizon of one step ) , through the relation : @xmath90 .",
    "however in our model the spreading of market volatility is enormously accentuated respect to the uncorrelated case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : corr ] for a comparison ) . as a consequence , in our model",
    ", we have effectively periods characterized by high volatility and strong cross - correlations alternated to normal market activities .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new model that aims to capture some of most puzzling aspects of statistical properties of financial time series .",
    "specifically , we have focalised our attention on two open problems : ( i ) leptokurtic behaviours in the probability distribution of stock returns and ( ii ) inter - dependence between market volatility and correlation structure when an ensemble of equities is considered .",
    "both aspects can not be taken into account by the standard approach commonly used in finance to describe correlated risk factors ( that is the covariate gaussian model ) .",
    "+ we have introduced a new model that encompasses in a coherent picture both points ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the mechanism we have proposed is based on the interplay between equities movements and market trend .",
    "the results obtained suggest two considerations : ( i ) fat tails and correlation structure of extreme returns could be indeed strictly connected ; ( ii ) an ensemble of stocks can be regarded as a `` critical system '' , where the collective inter - dependences among equities play a key role .",
    "our analysis may be of interest , from a theoretical point of view , in clarifying statistical properties of ensembles of stocks and , from an applied perspective , in improving portfolio market risk estimations .",
