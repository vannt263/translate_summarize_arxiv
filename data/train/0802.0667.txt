    "self - trapping of light beams in the form of spatial solitons in planar waveguides , which was demonstrated experimentally about two decades ago spatial - soliton , is one of fundamental effects in nonlinear optics .",
    "the variety of the spatial solitons may be greatly expanded if the waveguide is equipped with a multi - channel structure @xcite , that can be created by a permanent transverse modulation of the refractive index , or induced , in a photorefractive crystal , by a pair of laser beams ( with the ordinary polarization ) illuminating the crystal in transverse directions , while the probe beam , that creates the soliton(s ) , is launched in the extraordinary polarization @xcite . besides their interest to optical physics ,",
    "manipulations of spatial solitons by means of multi - channel trapping structures have a vast potential for applications to routing of data streams @xcite .",

    "the equation is @xmath2where the second term accounts for the transverse diffraction , @xmath3 represents the transverse modulation of the refractive index that induces the multi - channel structure , and term @xmath4 represents the optical nonlinearity , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , corresponding to the ordinary kerr effect . in the model including the kerr term and simplest transverse modulation , @xmath7 , solitons trapped in channels and a possibility of switching them between the channels were studied in ref .",
    "it was found that the entire family of fundamental ( single - humped ) solitons , with any value of integral power , @xmath8 , is stable .",
    "a family of stable double - humped bound states of fundamental solitons exists in this model too , provided that the power exceeds a certain threshold value which grows with the increase of @xmath9 .",
    "a possibility of the switching , realized as carrying the fundamental soliton over into an adjacent channel , was also shown in ref .",

    "the kp structure is quite relevant for applications to optics , where it corresponds to the simplest step - index profile of the transverse modulation .",
    "in addition to employing the multichannel settings , the variety of spatial - soliton states can be greatly expanded by using media with competing self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities .",
    "a well - known example of that is provided by the cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity .",
    "optical nonlinearities of the cq type were observed in chalcogenide glasses glass , and in some organic materials @xcite .",

    "@xcite , effects of the loss may be neglected in physically relevant settings , as experiments in optical crystals are conducted over sufficiently short propagation distances ( a few centimeters ) @xcite .",

    "( [ interval ] ) , and , accordingly , the soliton asymptotically goes over into the stable cw state , @xmath27 , in this limit . in terms of the bifurcation theory ,",
    "the disappearance of the bright soliton at this point is explained by its merger with a dark - soliton solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath28 , which also exists at @xmath29 .",
    "exactly at @xmath30 , the dark soliton degenerates into a _",
    "front solution _ , which vanishes in one limit , at @xmath31 , and asymptotically coincides with the cw state in the other,@xmath32    a natural possibility , which is promising both for the exploration of fundamental properties of guided solitons and for potential applications , is to study localized states generated as a result of the interplay between the cq nonlinearity and multichannel waveguiding structures . in ref .",
    "@xcite , solitons were investigated in the cq model including a single guiding channel of a rectangular shape .",
    "a distinctive feature of the channel - trapped solitons in that model is their _ bistability _ : while in interval ( interval ) , which hosts solution family ( [ soliton ] ) in the free space , the channel supports a single soliton state for each @xmath16 , the full existence region of the solitons includes an additional interval , @xmath33 ( the value of @xmath34 depends on the depth and width of the guiding channel ) , where two different solitons are found for a given value of @xmath16 , _ both _ being stable ( note that a guiding channel does not give rise to soliton bistability in the model with the cubic nonlinearity @xcite ) .    the combination of the cq nonlinearity with a periodic array of guiding channels of the kp type was studied in ref .",
    "in addition to single - humped ( fundamental ) solitons , many families of stable multi - humped ( higher - order ) solutions , which also feature the bistability , were found in that model .",
    "independently , a model combining the cq nonlinearity and a periodic sinusoidal modulation function was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where similar results for soliton families were obtained . note that both these versions of the model including the cq terms and periodic potential function @xmath3 generate not only soliton families in the semi - infinite spectral gap , but also solitons in finite bandgaps , provided that the potential is strong enough .",
    "the finite - gap solitons are stable too , but they do not feature bistability .",
    "the most relevant setting for applications to the all - optical switching is based on two parallel guiding channels , rather than a periodic array .",
    "the respective model is based on eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with the effective potential in the form of @xmath35where @xmath9 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , the depth and width of each channel , and the thickness of the barrier which separates them .",
    "this model is also interesting in terms of the soliton dynamics , as it opens a way to study _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ ( ssb ) in spatial solitons supported by the two - channel configuration .",
    "the ssb in settings based on double potential wells has recently drawn a great deal of interest in the studies of bec , where it was realized experimentally @xcite , and analyzed theoretically , using , chiefly , finite - mode approximations , that replace the underlying gross - pitaevskii equation by a system of ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "a conclusion produced by the analysis is that double - well systems with the self - attractive cubic nonlinearity ( self - focusing , in terms of optics ) give rise to stable asymmetric states ( which is known as  macroscopic quantum self - trapping \" ) through destabilization of symmetric states , while the systems with the self - repulsive ( defocusing ) nonlinearity feature destabilization of antisymmetric solutions .",
    "the latter mechanism also generates stable asymmetric states .",
    "actually , a similar finite - mode analysis of the ssb of cw states in a nonlinear optical coupler ( which , for this purpose , is essentially tantamount to the double - channel waveguide ) was published much earlier in ref .",
    "that work reported results for the model with the self - focusing or defocusing kerr nonlinearity , as well as for a saturable nonlinearity .",
    "ssb in a double - well optical setting has been implemented in a photorefractive crystal ( which corresponds to the saturable nonlinearity ) @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present work is to find symmetric , antisymmetric and asymmetric self - trapped states ( i.e. , spatial solitons , in terms of nonlinear optics ) in the two - channel model with the cq nonlinearity , based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ dc ] ) , and explore bifurcations linking those states to each other . an obvious difference from the previous works , both those relying upon the finite - mode approximation @xcite and works which analyzed the full two - channel configuration in the combination with the cubic nonlinearity , such as ref .",
    "@xcite , is the competition between the self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities , which drastically alters various states , their stability , and bifurcations .",
    "note that dynamical switching of nonlinear localized beams in the same model as considered here was investigated in a recent work @xcite , by means of a variational approximation and direct simulations .",
    "the analysis had revealed four different transmission regimes , depending on the total power of the beam .",

    "[ sec3 ] . depending on the symmetry and width of the solitons , we identify eight types of the states , five stable and three unstable ( in the same configuration with the cubic nonlinearity , only three soliton species exist ) . the stability of each species is established in a rigorous form , via the computation of eigenvalues for modes of small perturbations around the solitons , and verified in direct simulations . for all unstable solutions ,",
    "the instability eigenvalues are real .",
    "however , in direct simulations the instability does not destroy the trapped states , but rather transforms them into robust breathers , that may feature dynamical ssb , and chaotic intrinsic oscillations , in some cases . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we demonstrate generic families ( branches ) of different soliton species , and bifurcations that link them together .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams are essentially different in cases of the strong and weak coupling between the two channels , i.e. , roughly speaking , for small and large values of separation @xmath37 between them , see eq .",

    "in the model with the cq nonlinearity , each waveguiding channel can support localized states of two different types , which we will call narrow and broad ones .",

    "the composite states , as well as the bistability of spatial solitons trapped in a single channel @xcite , are specific features of the model with the cq nonlinearity ( one may expect the same features in models with more general competing nonlinearities ) , which are not supported by nonlinearities of _ non - competing _ types , such as those represented by cubic or saturable terms in the nls equation",

    "it is natural too that powers of the broad states trapped in the single channel of the double width ( at @xmath51 ) , and in two widely separated channels ( at larger @xmath37 ) are nearly equal , as , for the nearly - cw configurations , @xmath50 is proportional to the total width of the area filled by the wave .    unlike the symmetric and antisymmetric states ,",
    "the evolution of asymmetric ones , i.e. , the trapped beams of the unipolar and bipolar composite and single - sided types , with the decrease of @xmath37 is not continuous .",
    "it was found that , at some small critical value of @xmath37 , each asymmetric state performs a jump , either into a symmetric state ( unipolar composite and single - sided spatial solitons ) , or into an antisymmetric one ( the bipolar composite spatial soliton ) .",

    "in fact , the instability growth rate for the broad antisymmetric states ( typically , it takes values @xmath64 ) is usually larger than its counterpart for the narrow symmetric and unipolar composite states , with the same parameters of the model , by a factor @xmath65 .",

    "[ fig8]-[fig11 ] .",
    "this outcome of the nonlinear evolution is observed despite the fact that the instability growth rate for small perturbations is always real , while the transition to breathers would be more straightforward in the case of an oscillatory instability , accounted for by pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "accordingly , the period of the established oscillations of the breather depends , although weakly , on the size of the initial perturbation which destabilized the underlying stationary soliton ( in the case shown in fig .",

    "additional simulations demonstrate that , unlike the period of the oscillations , the size of the symmetry breaking , if measured as the difference between the maximum values of the peak powers , practically does not depend on the size of the initial perturbation .    in most cases , the breathers formed from unstable solitons exhibit strictly periodic oscillations , as in figs .",
    "[ fig8](a ) and [ fig11 ] . however , one species of the unstable stationary states , _",

    "some irregularity is seen in the evolution of the peak powers in fig . [ fig9](b ) .",
    "the increase of the coupling between the channels , i.e. , a decrease in @xmath37 , makes the oscillations manifestly chaotic , see fig .",

    "[ fig13](a ) , actually involve not three but four different branches ( in compliance with general principles of the bifurcation theory @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , figs .",
    "[ fig12](b ) and [ fig13](b ) clearly demonstrate that branches @xmath86 and @xmath87 exist each in two copies , that are mirror images to each other : one is composed of a narrow soliton in the left channel and a broad one in the right channel , and vice versa .",
    "it is noteworthy that branches @xmath86 and @xmath88 , which represent , severally , the unstable unipolar composite solitons and stable single - sided broad solitons , meet and disappear through a tangent ( alias saddle - node @xcite ) bifurcation in fig . [",
    "fig10](a ) .",
    "also worthy to note is the fact that branches @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which meet and disappear at the lower left turning point in fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) , are both stable , contrary to the  naive \" expectation that one of them ought to be unstable ( this fact was already discovered in the single - channel cq model @xcite ) .",
    "the bifurcation diagram in the plane of @xmath50 and @xmath92 actually describes the ssb , in terms of stationary solutions .",
    "note that the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) features a loop , which is a characteristic feature of the ssb in models with saturable @xcite and cq nonlinearities . in the latter context ,",
    "closed bifurcation loops were found in the discrete ( lattice ) version of the cq model @xcite , and in a system of two linearly coupled nls equations with the cq nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the presence of the bifurcation loop implies that the broken symmetry is eventually restored , under the action of the quintic term . on the other hand , the diagram in the same plane for solution branches @xmath93 , @xmath85 and @xmath87 in fig .",
    "fig13(b ) does not display a closed loop .",
    "in fact , two mutually symmetric branches @xmath87 in this diagram terminate because of difficulties with the numerical continuation to larger values of @xmath50 ; on the other hand , the branch of broad antisymmetric solitons , @xmath94 , can be continued easily , and the continuation does not reveal its stabilization at any particular value of @xmath50 ( in direct simulations , the broad antisymmetric soliton always turns into a persistent breather , cf .",
    "[ fig8](b ) ) , hence it is plausible that the configuration observed in fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) is not going to form a closed bifurcation loop . as concerns the continuation of branch @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) ( and also in fig .",
    "[ fig14](b ) below ) to @xmath95 , this happens with @xmath96 , when state @xmath82 becomes asymptotically similar to cw state @xmath22 , see eq .",
    "similarly , state @xmath84 in figs .",
    "[ fig13](b ) , and also in [ fig15](b ) below , become similar , in the same limit to a dark soliton in the free space .      at essentially larger values of the thickness of the buffer layer between the channels ( @xmath37 ) , which implies weak interaction between them , the character of the bifurcation diagrams changes",
    "qualitatively , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] .",
    "in this situation , the tangent bifurcation through which branches @xmath86 and @xmath88 disappeared in the case of the strong inter - channel coupling does not take place , cf .",
    "[ fig12](a ) .",
    "instead , there occurs another bifurcation that involves solution families @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( in fact , family @xmath88 of the stable broad single - sided solutions consists of two branches , one to the right of the bifurcation point , and the continuation to the left of it ) .",
    "this bifurcation manifests itself in the diagrams that involve the sets of both symmetric and antisymmetric states , i.e. , @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig14](a ) , and @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ fig15](a ) .    in the plane of @xmath99 ,",
    "the continuation of branches @xmath88 toward larger values of the power does not reveal any trend to forming a closed loop . instead",
    ", the branches remain virtually identical to lines @xmath100 , which is obvious in figs .",
    "fig14(b ) and [ fig15](b ) .",
    "this feature is explained by the propensity of the broad single - sided soliton to turn into the front state ( which obviously has @xmath100 ) , as shown above in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    in both cases of the strong and weak coupling ,",
    "the model gives rise to four bifurcations : those involving sets of branches @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 in figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] , and sets @xmath97 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 in figs .",
    "[ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] .",
    "the transition between the bifurcation diagrams corresponding to these two cases amounts to the well - known generic type of the rearrangement , when a branch splits off from a pitchfork bifurcation pattern , leaving behind a bifurcation of the tangent type ( in the present situation , the detaching branch is @xmath108 , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) ) .",
    "we did not aim to find an exact value of @xmath37 ( for fixed @xmath9 and @xmath36 ) at which the bifurcation changes its character .",
    "the aim of this work was to explore spatial solitons that can be trapped in a planar waveguide which combines two fundamental ingredients , namely , the dual - channel configuration and competing ( cubic - quintic ) nonlinearity .",
    "we have found eight species of the solitons , including symmetric and antisymmetric ones of the broad and narrow types , unipolar and bipolar composite solitons , and the broad and narrow species of single - sided solitons .",
    "in contrast to this situation , previously studied models combining two - channel traps with non - competing nonlinearities ( of the cubic and saturable types ) gave rise to three species of the states ( symmetric , antisymmetric , and single - sided asymmetric ones ) .",
    "the stability of the eight families was explored through the computation of perturbation eigenvalues and by means of direct simulations .",
    "it has been concluded that three families are unstable , _",
    "viz_. , narrow symmetric , broad antisymmetric , and unipolar composite states , each of the other five species being stable as a whole .",
    "all instabilities against infinitesimal perturbations are accounted for by real eigenvalues . however , unstable solitons are not destroyed by the instability , but rather turn into robust breathers , which feature dynamical ssb ( spontaneousness symmetry breaking ) , between the field intensities in the two channels .",
    "the breathers generated by strongly unstable broad antisymmetric solitons turn out to be chaotic ( rather than periodic ) .",
    "it is interesting that the broad and narrow spatial solitons of the antisymmetric type switch their stability in the limit when the two - channel setting is going to merge into the single - channel one : the broad state becomes stable , while the narrow one is destabilized .",
    "four bifurcations linking different branches of the stationary states have been found .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams may be of two different types , corresponding to the strong or weak coupling between the two channels . in the latter case ,",
    "the bifurcation diagram involving the symmetric and unipolar composite states features a closed loop ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "an additional finding , which is relevant to the single - channel setting as well , is the stable front - shaped state ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "numerous stable spatial solitons possible in this model may find applications to all - optical data - processing schemes . moreover , the potential of the two - channel model is not exhausted by the analysis of the eight types of the trapped states reported in this work .",
    "additional species of spatial soliton are possible in it , the form of symmetric , antisymmetric , composite and single - sided configurations based on stable broad dipoles ( intrinsically antisymmetric states ) trapped in each channel , as well as complexes involving a fundamental soliton in one channel and a broad dipole in the other .",
    "a challenging generalization is also possible for a two - dimensional model with the cq nonlinearity and two parallel trapping channels . in that case",
    ", each channel may carry a fundamental two - dimensional soliton or a vortex .",
    "this work was supported , in a part , by israel science foundation through center - of - excellence grant no .",
