    "the standard model of cosmology ( or cdm ) assumes that the dark matter(dm ) is cold and effectively collisionless .",
    "it assumes a hierarchical framework for galaxy formation and throughout their evolution galaxies are subject to frequent collisions and interactions with nearby galaxies that leave surrounding material in the form of tidal debris , therefore studying tidal features can yield important clues on galaxy evolution .",
    "tidal features can appear in the form of complicated structures@xcite , but it is frequent to observe structures like tidal tails around the bulge of massive galaxies@xcite , some early - type galaxies present shells@xcite which can be seen as smooth arcs of ellipses centered around its host galaxy decreasing their surface brightness for larger radii , there are also debris in the form of stellar streams@xcite .",
    "several analyses of the spheroidal components of tidally disturbed early - type galaxies(etgs)@xcite suggest that structural properties such as the effective radius(radius at which half of the total light of the system is emitted ) and their surface brightness are quite similar from those of the other ellipticals or the spheroids of galaxies with few or no signs of tidal interaction .",
    "other results have shown evidence of kinematically decoupled components in early - type galaxies@xcite . given the standard paradigm of cdm",
    "it is expected that even these `` passive '' galaxies also formed by galaxy mergers , then the similarity of the bulge regions for the etgs could be due to the some minor mergers(galaxy mergers of unequal mass with mass ratio of @xmath3 ) slightly affecting the bulge but massive enough to still induce tidal debris , or by major mergers(mergers of comparable mass galaxies ) that happened a long time ago so that now the bulge has relaxed .",
    "cosmological n - body simulations in cdm have shown@xcite that merger events are frequent when galaxies are growing , however , it must be taken into account that anticipating the final structure around a galaxy is rather difficult given the dependence on the environment and merger history in the formation of each particular galaxy@xcite .",
    "observationally , it is not uncommon to run into difficulties identifying and studying tidal structures around galaxies , sometimes these structures are too faint compared to the central light distribution that a detailed analysis proves impossible .",
    "nevertheless , there are observations where faint structures such as shells are clearly seen around galaxies at some particular radii from the center of their associated host@xcite . in some situations it has been possible to identify younger stellar populations in the outskirts compared to those in the inner bulge@xcite probably reminiscent of a late gas accretion .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the cdm model the spatial location of these remnants of past interaction is not predicted and has to be tracked with numerical simulations as it depends on the history of each galaxy .",
    "metallicity is another powerful tool to constrain galaxy evolution across cosmic epochs as it is known to be correlated to gas infall , outflows due to supernovae , and star formation rate within the galaxy .",
    "recent studies of star formation focused on local group dwarf galaxies @xcite revealing radial gradients in metallicity @xcite , and most of them seem to have old stellar populations formed @xmath4 10 gyrs ago@xcite , followed by a more quiescent star formation likely due to loss of gas mass at the reionization epoch .",
    "there are high redshift galaxies ( @xmath5  3 ) that also show metallicity gradients , their regions of high star formation rate(sfr ) are also of lower metallicity@xcite due to a large gas infall , they are sorrounded by a more enriched disc , in @xcite the authors concluded that these observations are consistent with accretion of metal - poor gas in massive galaxies where a high sfr can be sustained without requiring frequent mergers , this picture was also suggested by studies of gas rich disks at @xmath5 1 - 2@xcite .    in order to describe the debris around galaxies and stellar population it is necessary to include the gas dynamics in simulations , even though there is an uncertainty due to our lack of understanding of the baryonic processes , their addition is also required to partially reduce some discrepancies of the cdm model , for instance , the cusp - core problem(see @xcite for a review ) , the overabundance of satellites@xcite or the too - big - to - fail@xcite issue .",
    "however , some of these discrepancies might also be solved assuming different properties for the dark matter , leading to for instance , scalar field dark matter(sfdm ) @xcite , strongly self - interacting dm@xcite , warm dark matter@xcite .",
    "it is of particular interest for us the sfdm alternative , here the mass of the field is assumed to be very small ( @xmath0ev/@xmath6 ) such that its de broglie wavelength is of order @xmath4  kpc , relevant for galactic scales .",
    "the quantum behavior of the field has created much interest in the model due to its success to account for some discrepancies mentioned above with dark matter properties only , for example , the small mass keeps the central density from increasing indefinitely due to the uncertainty principle in contrast to cdm simulations where supernova feedback is required@xcite , note that the amount of feedback required to produce a constant central density may be in conflict with other observations@xcite .",
    "an interesting property that has been noted for scalar field haloes in excited states or in a superposition of them is the appearance of `` ripples '' in their mass density profiles@xcite .",
    "this property motivated us to investigate whether features like rings or shells in non - interacting galaxies hosted by multistate scalar field haloes could arise independently of the galaxy merger mechanism .",
    "in the next section we give a brief overview of previous works in the scalar field dark matter model and describe a model for galaxy formation in sfdm haloes .",
    "we modify the hydrodynamics code zeus to implement an evolving sfdm halo in which a gaseous component is present , we provide the details of our simulations in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results and section 5 is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the main idea in the scalar field dark matter model@xcite considers a self - interacting scalar field with a very small mass , typically of @xmath0ev/@xmath6 , such that the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle and the interactions prevent gravitational collapse in self - gravitating structures , thus the haloes are characterized with homogeneous densities ( usually refered as a cores ) in their centers , in general the core sizes depend on the values of the mass and the self - interacting parameters@xcite(for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "there has been several studies of the cosmological evolution that results for a scalar field mass @xmath710@xmath8ev/@xmath6 , with this mass the cosmological density evolution of cdm can be reproduced@xcite , there is consistency with the acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background radiation@xcite and it implies a sharp cut - off in the mass power spectrum for halo masses below @xmath9m@xmath10 suppressing structure formation of low mass dark matter haloes@xcite . moreover , there is particular interest in finding equilibrium configurations of the system of equations that describe the field ( einstein - klein - gordon system ) and of its weak field approximation ( schrdinger - poisson(sp ) system ) , different authors have obtained solutions interpretated as boson stars or later as dark matter haloes showing agreement with rotation curves in galaxies and velocity dispersion profiles in dwarf spheroidal galaxies@xcite .",
    "so far the large and small scales observations are well described with the small mass and thus has been taken as a prefered value but the precise values of the mass and self - interaction parameters are still uncertain , we believe tighter constraints can come from numerical simulations @xcite and comparisons with large galaxy samples which we plan to do in the future .",
    "recently the idea of the scalar field has gained interest , given the uncertainty in the parameters the model has adopted different names in the literature depending on the regime that is under discussion , for instance , if the interactions are not present and the mass is @xmath0ev/@xmath6 this limit was called fuzzy dark matter@xcite or more recently wave dark matter@xcite , another limit is when the sf self - interactions are described with a quartic term in the scalar field potential and dominate over the mass(quadratic ) term , this was studied in @xcite and called repulsive dark matter or fluid dark matter by@xcite .",
    "notice that for a scalar field mass of @xmath0ev/@xmath6 the critical temperature of condensation for the field is t@xmath11tev , which is very high , if the temperature of the field is below its critical temperature it can form a cosmological bose einstein condensate , if it condenses it is called bose - einstein condensed(bec ) dark matter@xcite .",
    "@xcite mentioned that axions could also form bose - einstein condensates even though their mass is larger than the previous preferred value , notice that the result was contested in @xcite , this suggest that the condensation process should be study in more detail to confirm it can remain as bec dark matter . in @xcite , it was found that complex scalar field with @xmath12<@xmath13ev/@xmath6 that decoupled being still relativistic will always form a cosmological bose - einstein condensate described by the ground state wavefunction , this does not preclude the existence of bosons with higher energy , particulary in dark matter halos .",
    "we see that the smallness of the boson mass is its characteristic property and cosmological condensation is a likely consequence .",
    "the preferred mass of the scalar field dark matter lies close to @xmath0ev/@xmath6 satisfying the above constraint , although there are still uncertainties on the mass parameter , in order to avoid confusion with the known axion and help with the identification in future works , we find it useful and appropiate to name the scalar field dark matter candidate , given the above characteristics we can define it as a particle with mass @xmath12<@xmath13ev/@xmath6 , being commonly described by its wavefunction we choose to name this dm candidate _ psyon_.    it is worth emphasizing that despite the variety of names given to the model the main idea mentioned above remains the same , it is the quantum properties that arise due to the small mass of the boson that characterize and distinguishes this paradigm , analoguous to the standard cosmological model represented by the cdm paradigm whose preferred dark matter candidates are the wimps(weakly interacting massive particles ) , one being the neutralino , we see that all the above regimes sfdm , repulsive dm , axion dm , or any other model assuming an ultra light bosonic particle comprise a single class of paradigm , which we call _ quantum dark matter_(qdm ) paradigm .",
    "as pointed before , in the qdm paradigm the small mass of the dark matter boson leads to the posibility of forming cosmological condensates , even for axions which are non - thermally produced and have masses in @xmath14ev/@xmath6@xcite , from here we can obtain a characteristic property that distinguishes these dark matter candidates from wimps or neutrinos , namely , the existence of _ bosons in the condensed state _ , or simply _ bics _ , from our above discussion the axion and psyon are included in the bics .",
    "there has been considerable work to find numerical solutions to the non - interacting sfdm in the non - relativistic regime to model spherically symmetric haloes@xcite , and also for the self - interacting sfdm @xcite , it is worth noting that as mentioned in @xcite for the weak field limit of the system that determines the evolution of a spherically symmetric scalar field , that is , the einstein and klein - gordon equations , for a complex and a real scalar field the system reduces to the schrdinger - poisson equations@xcite . from current bounds reported in @xcite obtained by imposing that the sf behaves cosmologically as pressureless matter(dust ) we obtained that the interacting parameter would be extremely small for the typical mass of @xmath410@xmath8ev/@xmath6",
    ", therefore we expect that solutions to the sp system with no interactions would behave qualitatively similar to those when self - interactions are included , this assumption is supported by the similarity in the solutions for a small self - coupling found in other works@xcite , in this work we will study the non - interacting solutions",
    ".    one characteristic feature of stationary solutions of the form @xmath15 for the sp system is the appearance of nodes in the spatial function @xmath16 , these nodes are associated to different energy states of the sf , the zero node solution corresponds to the ground state , one node to the first excited state , and so on .",
    "these excited states solutions fit rotation curves(rcs ) of large galaxies up to the outermost measured data and can even reproduce the wiggles seen at large radii in high - resolution observations @xcite .",
    "however , haloes that are purely in a single excited state seem to be unstable when the number of particles is not conserved(finite perturbations ) and decay to the ground state with different decay rates@xcite , though they are stable when the number of particles is conserved(infinitesimal perturbations ) .",
    "the ground state solution is stable under finite perturbations and infinitesimal perturbations@xcite , but has difficulties to correctly fit the rotation curves in large galaxies because its associated rc has a fast keplerian behavior shortly after reaching its maximum value unable to remain flat enough at large radii .",
    "one way to overcome this problem was to consider that bosons are not in one state but instead coexist in different states within the halo , given our intention to describe dark matter haloes we will refer to such configurations as multistate halos(mshs)@xcite .",
    "the size of the msh is determined by the most excited state that accurately fits the rc for large radii , excited states are distributed to larger radii than the ground state , and in contrast to the halo with single state there are mshs that are stable under finite perturbations provided the ground state in the final halo configuration has enough mass to stabilize the coexisting state@xcite . in @xcite it was shown that mshs can be studied in the classical approach as a collection of classical scalar fields coupled through gravity , one field @xmath17 for each state , this would modify the sp system such that its source of energy density would be the sum of densities in each state@xcite , where each state satisfies its respective schrdinger equation and the states are coupled through the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath18 .    in spherical symmetry ( in units @xmath19=1 , c=1 ) the sf solutions , @xmath20 ,",
    "satisfying the einstein - klein - gordon system are related to the sp wavefunctions through @xmath21 with @xmath12 the mass of the sf . for stationary solutions we can assume wavefunctions of the form @xmath22",
    ", then the sp system reads @xmath23 @xmath24 with @xmath25 the laplacian operator in spherical coordinates , and @xmath26 the energy eigenstates .",
    "we consider the case of a msh with only the ground and first excited states given that for this msh @xcite reported the critical value for its stability under small perturbations .",
    "if the ground state has @xmath27 particles and there are @xmath28 in the excited state , the authors found that msh would be stable under small perturbations provided the fraction @xmath29 in all the configurations studied in which @xmath30 is larger than the maximum for stability @xmath31 , the induced instability causes the configuration to lose a few particles and a remarkable effect takes place , the excited state does a fast transition to the ground state and viceversa , that is , the populations of the states are inverted such that the final @xmath30 complies with the stability condition ( [ eta ] ) , after the inversion the msh approaches a stable configuration where the particle number remains constant for each state , after the transition the particles that were initially in the excited state are now in the ground state where they have redistributed and become more compact than in their original distribution .",
    "this population inversion(pi ) is a characteristic feature of mshs and as we will show it can have consequences in the gas distribution and on the accretion rate during the period of galaxy formation .",
    "in fact , given the cut - off in the mass power spectrum due to the small mass of the psyon we expect a delay in the first structures to collapse compared to the those found in cdm@xcite , this was confirmed with cosmological simulations for a mass of @xmath32@xcite , therefore , this intrinsic change of states within mshs at high redshift might have observable consequences in the gas and stellar properties of the galaxies that will form in such potential wells .",
    "initial fluctuations that grow due to the cosmological expansion of the universe eventually separate from it and start collapsing due to its own gravity , at this time ( known as turnaround ) the halo has a number of psyons that can be in different states , their values would be determined before the collapse of the configuration , and have some dependence on the its local environment . depending on the number density of bosons populating the excited states we can have different fates for the haloes as mentioned in subsection ( 2.2 ) .    from the mentioned results of the literature and based on the successful fits to different galaxies we propose the following model of galaxy formation in sfdm haloes .",
    "the smallest and less dense systems , such as dwarf galaxies , would reside in sfdm haloes with most bosons in the ground state except possibly for just a few excited particles@xcite , this is because the potential wells of these haloes , being the lowest dense systems , would be just massive enough to collapse and allow the existence of the state of minimum energy that would form a bound configuration .",
    "larger configurations that had initially a larger number of bosons in excited states than in the ground state can undergo a population inversion and reach a stable state , collapse to a dense ground state or become a black hole depending on how large the fraction of particles in excited states is after turnaround , given the different possible outcomes for this case we expect that most galaxies are formed this way , for instance , ellipticals can form when haloes transition to a stable configuration to form a ground state and quickly deepen the gravitational potential resulting in a dense and compact structure where the bulge can form , for high surface brightness galaxies which usually have rcs that fall slowly after its maximum , these galaxies would likely correspond to sfdm haloes whose final stable configuration has a comparable number of bosons in the excited and ground states as both states would contribute evenly in the central region increasing the potential well where more star formation can take place , and for distances larger than a given radius ( likely the first maximum peak in the rc ) the ground state would be a small contribution to the density , thus in the outer region the baryonic rc would remain below its maximum . another possible outcome for extended haloes",
    "is when the fraction of excited particles is below its stability threshold , here gravity will slowly redistribute dm bosons in the stable msh but mostly keeping the particle number constant , considering that psyons in the excited states are subdominant but more widely distributed than the ones in the ground state of a msh , the dm gravitational potential in the center would be less dense than in the high surface brightness case so that gas accretion would also proceed more slowly resulting in rotation curves for the baryonic matter that slowly increase to large radii or with almost flat profiles , this case is quite similar to what is found in low surface brighness galaxies@xcite .",
    "this galaxy formation scenario broadly describes the different galaxy types showing that only due to the dark matter properties in the context of sfdm it is possible to agree with the general features of several galaxies .",
    "however , we do not expect this scenario to represent all galaxies , in fact , to get a better description of individual galaxies we require taking into account other fundamental parameters that affect their evolution , such as the environment , angular momentum , galaxy mergers etc .",
    ", we will leave a more in dept exploration of the scenario including the full astrophysical processes for a future work .    for now , we take the given description of elliptical galaxies to explore whether some substructure found in some of these galaxies can be a consequence of the properties of the background dm halo where such ellipticals are formed .",
    "we do not discard the possibility that shells or rings result from mergers , instead , we explore a new possible mechanism in which they can arise offering an alternative explanation to the tidal debris in certain non - interacting ellipticals .",
    "we study this issue in a multistate halo .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this work we have seen that if the dark matter is a ultra light scalar field the internal structure of galaxies can reflect fossil records of their formation , in our case we study the formation of tidal structures similar to rings and shells in non - interacting galaxies .",
    "we discussed the nature of these structures in the context of sfdm and conclude that independently of galaxy mergers they can arise as a consequence of the quantum nature of the scalar field dark matter boson(hereafter _ psyons _ ) that form the halo where galaxies are embedded in , mainly , due to the intrinsic ripples in the dark matter halo density profile .",
    "the possibility of describing tidal substructure in scalar field dark matter halos was also suggested in @xcite but under different halo configurations and without including the evolution of a gaseous component , here we make use of spherically symmetric haloes in multistates because their stability has been studied and confirmed in previous works@xcite .",
    "in addition , they possess desirable properties to describe a variety of galaxies .",
    "inspired by the numerical solutions in @xcite , where they reported the maximum fraction of psyons in excited states ( eq .",
    "[ eta ] ) to form a stable multistate halo composed of the ground state and first excited state , we propose a semi - analytical model to describe a similar halo configuration and study the distribution of a gaseous disc that is contained within such scalar field dm halo .",
    "the halo is set to be initially unstable by choosing a fraction of excited boson above the stability limit , this induces a transition to reach a final stable configuration affecting the initial gas distribution , after the transition the population of the states is inverted and the halo stabilizes once the ground state dominates the halo mass that by gravity will be confined later in the center of the halo . at the end of the simulations ( @xmath33 gyrs ) part of",
    "the gas keeps orbiting in the form of a ring outside the main bulge - like region , the structure of the ring is not significantly different when the halo transition happens early ( @xmath34=@xmath35 gyrs ) or late(@xmath34=@xmath36 gyrs ) but the ring broadens if the transition is slow and becomes more defined for fast transitions . due to the lack of stability parameter for msh in higher energy states we explore the first non trivial superposition of multistates , given the positive results it seems that tidal structures would also be found at larger radii for sfdm haloes that have boson in higher excited states , although they would become fainter with distance , this would agree with shells that appear to be distribited at larger radii .",
    "the tidal features in this work have a distinct origin from the usual tidal stripping of galaxies , they emerge from the quantum properties of the psyons that compose the dark halo , the presence of the symmetric ring is due to the spherically symmetry hypothesis , deviations from this symmetry could result in incomplete rings and shells although a certain degree of symmetry should remain which distinguishes to remnants that come from recent galaxy mergers that depend on the path of the accreted satellites and does not necessarily leave tidal debris of a particular symmetry , our results suggest that outer regions of dark haloes may not be totally smooth .",
    "exploring in more detail the regions where shells and rings form could also help to put constraints on their origin , their formation , and serve to test galaxy and halo formation scenarios such as the quantum dark matter(qdm ) paradigm .",
    "additionally , we have provided a classification for the dark matter models that are based on the assumption that the dark matter is a scalar field of a very small mass that proves useful for future references and that helps to establish the main feature of the particle candidates of this paradigm .",
    "we formulate a galaxy formation scenario based on known results of halo formation in the sfdm context that can explain qualitatively the general properties of the different galaxy types in the universe and applied to interpret our findings .",
    "given the success of the sfdm model to account for the apparent discrepancies of the standard cdm model with only dark matter properties , it will be desirable to include astrophysical processes in simulations to get a fair comparison with state - of - the - art cdm simulations .",
    "the qdm paradigm is indeed an interesting possibility that deserves further study .",

    "<S> recent observations of tidal debris around galaxies have revealed that the structural properties of the spheroidal components of tidally disturbed galaxies are similar to those found in non - interacting early - type galaxies(etgs ) , likely due to minor merging events that do not strongly affect the bulge region or to major mergers that happened a long time ago . we show that independently of merger events , tidal features like shells or rings can also arise if the the dark matter is an ultra light scalar field of mass @xmath0ev@xmath1 . in the scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) model the small mass precludes halo formation below @xmath2 reducing the number of small galaxies today , it produces shallow density profiles due to the uncertainty principle in contrast to the steep profiles found in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , in addition to the usual soliton solution there exists dark matter haloes in multistates , characterized by ripples in their density profiles , which are stable provided that most of the halo mass resides in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we use the hydrodynamics code zeus to track the gas evolution in a background potential given by a superposition of the ground and first excited state of the scalar field , we study this configuration when it is initially unstable ( excited state more massive than ground state ) but by a population inversion in the states it eventually becomes stable , this could happen when haloes decoupled from the expansion of the universe and collapse to reach a state of equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we found that tidal structures like rings are formed at a particular radius as a direct consequence of the wavelike structure of the dark matter halo , thus they possess a certain degree of symmetry that can be used to distinguish them from remnants formed through the usual galaxy merging mechanism . in our simulations </S>",
    "<S> most of the gas concentrates in the center of the halo forming a dense and compact structure likely enhancing star formation in this region , however , some of the gas always remains trapped between the overdensity regions of the background sfdm halo predicting surrounding features even in non - interacting galaxies . in galaxies that are not strongly interacting with their neighbors , these structures may leave traces such as radial gradients in stellar metallicity , rings of dust , or even in the form of a younger population of stars at particular radii in contrast to the old stellar population dominating the bulge region , our results offer a new mechanism in which features like rings and shells can emerge purely from the quantum properties of this ultra light scalar field .    </S>",
