    "time - reversal ( @xmath3 ) invariant superconductors have attracted a lot of attention lately as they provide possibility to realize topologically nontrivial gapped phases of matter.@xcite while topologically nontrivial @xmath3-invariant gapped phases of @xmath4he were discussed already back in the eighties@xcite ( these phases also appear in the recent constructions,@xcite see also ref .  ) , the key observation highlighting the general role of @xmath5 and electron - hole ( eh ) symmetries in the topological classification of gapped superconductors has been made only recently : schnyder _ et al_@xcite has noted that combining @xmath5 and eh symmetries , one finds that the bogoliubov de gennes hamiltonian @xmath6 obeys a chiral symmetry : @xmath7 , with @xmath8 unitary . in eq .  , the @xmath9 matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the single particle hamiltonian and the pairing potential",
    ". there exists a basis@xcite in which the chirality operator is @xmath12 , and the hamiltonian takes the block offdiagonal form , @xmath13 a gapped system , as the determinant of @xmath14 is nonvanishing for all @xmath15 , realizes a mapping from the momentum space to the space @xmath16 of invertible @xmath9 matrices . in @xmath1 ,",
    "such mappings fall into distinct homotopy classes , which directly translates to the possibility for topologically nontrivial three dimensional gapped systems , i.e. , systems which are not deformable into a @xmath15-independent gapped model without a gap closing somewhere throughout the deformation.@xcite such topologically nontrivial gapped superconductors are called topological superconductors .",
    "( topological superconductors also exist in , @xcite but the ones considered in this work are three dimensional . )",
    "the homotopy class of the system is characterized by an integer bulk topological invariant @xmath17,@xcite constructed such that its nonzero value signals a topological superconductor .    besides their value in analyzing gapped phases , homotopy arguments prove to be useful in studying systems without a gap.@xcite in such systems , homotopy arguments can be used to determine the possible dimensionalities of topologically stable fermi surfaces , defined as manifolds of zero energy that can not be destroyed by a small deformation of the hamiltonian . a fermi surface is stable if a nontrivial topological charge can be assigned to it ; the possible values of the topological charge also result from the homotopy considerations .    as we have illustrated , the block - offdiagonal structure in eq .",
    "provides key insights into the topology of gapped phases of @xmath3-invariant superconductors . in this work",
    "we would like to study what insights it could provide regarding the nature of gapless phases of these systems .",
    "one motivation for this , naturally , lies in the characterization of the possible nodal structures of systems such as high-@xmath18 materials , or noncentrosymmetric superconductors.@xcite the reason , however , why this question is especially timely is given by the relevance of gapless systems in the context of topological superconductors : first , as @xmath17 does not change under non - gap closing deformations of the theory , the system must become gapless across a topological phase transition@xcite ( a transition between gapped phases with different @xmath17 ) .",
    "second , the surface of a topological superconductor can also be thought of as a two dimensional gapless system : it is known to support topologically protected gapless modes,@xcite robust against arbitrary deformations ( provided that these do not close the bulk gap ) .    with these motivations in mind ,",
    "our first objective is to present a homotopy argument leading to the topological characterization of fermi surfaces of @xmath19 dimensional superconductors .",
    "this is carried out in sec .",
    "[ sec : fsandq ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] we deduce the consequences of our findings for two dimensional systems , including the surface of a topological superconductor .",
    "the consequences in three dimensions are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3d ] , together with the implications regarding topological phase transitions .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "due to @xmath20 , the vanishing of the gap at a point @xmath21 on a fermi surface is in one - to - one correspondence with the vanishing of the determinant of @xmath14 at this point .",
    "we first assume that @xmath21 is not a time - reversal invariant momentum ( trim ) , i.e. , there is no such reciprocal lattice vector @xmath22 that @xmath23 .",
    "then , in the vicinity of @xmath21 , the matrix @xmath14 need not satisfy any restrictions ; all restrictions stemming from eh and @xmath5 symmetries relate@xcite @xmath14 to @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in the vicinity of @xmath21 the only restriction on @xmath25 is chiral symmetry .",
    "the properties of fermi surfaces in @xmath0 systems with this restriction were studied by wen and zee.@xcite their considerations can be formulated in a compact way which also includes the @xmath1 case as follows ( see also refs .",
    "): for a fermi surface of dimension @xmath26 , in the @xmath27 dimensions transverse to it , @xmath28 in the vicinity of the surface",
    ". then , embracing the point @xmath21 on the fermi surface with a small @xmath29 sphere @xmath30 in the transverse dimensions , we have a mapping from @xmath30 to the space @xmath16 .",
    "if this represents a nontrivial class in the homotopy group @xmath31 , there is no small deformation of @xmath32 which would make the map contractible to the inside of @xmath30 , thus would remove the point of @xmath33 within @xmath30 , i.e. , the fermi surface is stable . for @xmath34 only for @xmath35 is there a nontrivial homotopy group , @xmath36 .",
    "this leads to our central result : @xmath5-invariant superconductors can support @xmath37 dimensional topologically stable fermi surfaces , which can be assigned a topological charge taking values in the additive group of integers .",
    "fermi surfaces in @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) are thus fermi lines ( fermi points ) . their dimensionality can be also understood by noting that a fermi surface is a manifold of @xmath38 , i.e. , it is defined by two real equations for @xmath39.@xcite the topological charge can be found by noting that the sphere in the transverse space is @xmath40 , i.e. , it is a circle .",
    "the topological invariant @xmath41 characterizing mappings from the circle to @xmath16 is simply given by the winding number of the phase of @xmath42 .",
    "the topological invariance of this charge means that @xmath41 does not change under deformations of the circle into any loop around the fermi surface , nor under deformations of @xmath43 , provided that the loop does not cross a fermi surface during these changes .",
    "following ref .",
    "( see also refs .  )",
    ", we can express this integer charge directly through the hamiltonian as @xmath44d{l } , \\label{eq : vortex}\\ ] ] where the integral is for a loop around the fermi surface .",
    "due to its dimensionality , and due to the fact that @xmath41 is the winding of the phase , a fermi surface can be viewed as a momentum space vortex in @xmath45 as an `` order parameter '' .",
    "henceforth , we will often use this vortex picture ; we emphasize that in this work , vortices , antivortices always refer to these momentum space objects and not to real space defects in the superconducting order parameter . under a deformation of @xmath14 , local@xcite creation of fermi surfaces",
    "proceeds through formation of vortex loops in three dimensions , and vortex - antivortex pairs in two dimensions .",
    "processes in the opposite direction are also possible : a large enough deformation can shrink and remove vortex loops , or annihilate vortex - antivortex pairs ; this explains why the notion of topological stability provides robustness only against small perturbations . for lattice systems , instead of referring to the way the fermi surfaces are created , a more general statement can be formulated , similarly to ref .  :",
    "assume that @xmath46 is smooth and periodic in momentum space .",
    "in @xmath0 , the net winding is then zero in the reciprocal unit cell and is equal to the sum of the topological charges of the fermi points . in @xmath1 , a similar statement",
    "can be made for two dimensional sections of the reciprocal unit cell parallel to its faces , with the intersections of fermi lines with a section playing the role of fermi points .    at this stage , it is worthwhile to compare our result to earlier findings for single band systems.@xcite while these works also find @xmath37 dimensional fermi surfaces , ref",
    ".   finds a topological charge with @xmath47 values instead of @xmath48 values .",
    "( ref .   found a @xmath48 charge for a spin - degenerate , single band system . ) for comparison , we consider the two - dimensional example of high-@xmath18 materials from ref .  .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian and the pairing potential are @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the pauli matrices in spin - space , and the band parameter @xmath51 , the singlet pairing strength @xmath52 , and the fermi momentum @xmath53 are positive constants .",
    "the vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 , corresponding to spin - orbit coupling and the triplet pairing strength , respectively , are real odd functions of @xmath39 . for @xmath56 , there are four fermi points at @xmath57 , which split into pairs of fermi points once @xmath54 , @xmath55 become nonzero . ref",
    ".   finds that the fermi points for @xmath56 have zero charge and they split up into pairs with unit charge , in agreement with the @xmath47 sum rule . as a fermi point with zero charge",
    "is not topologically stable , an alternative scenario seems also possible , in which the system becomes gapped due to a small deformation . applying our considerations",
    "shows that this is not the case . after a suitable transformation diagonalizing the chirality operator , the offdiagonal block of @xmath58 becomes @xmath59 . for @xmath56 , @xmath60 where the winding of the phase of @xmath61 around each fermi point is of unit magnitude , hence for each fermi point @xmath62 . under a small deformation ,",
    "the splitting into two fermi points with @xmath63 is thus the generic behavior .",
    "the example here suggests ref .",
    "to be consistent with our findings upon identifying the @xmath47 charge as",
    "after discussing aspects for which the restrictions relating @xmath46 to @xmath64 are unimportant , we turn to study the implications of these restrictions .",
    "time - reversal invariant superconductors can be classified depending on symmetries under spin - rotation : they are said to belong to class diii if there is no spin rotation symmetry , to class aiii if @xmath65 is conserved and to class ci if there is full spin - rotation symmetry.@xcite the restrictions on @xmath46 are as follows@xcite :    [ eqs : drel ] @xmath66    for class aiii , a chiral symmetry applies for each spin separately . from these relations",
    "we see that if @xmath21 is on a fermi surface , so is @xmath67 . regarding the further consequences of eqs .  , we first focus on the two dimensional case , i.e. , the fermi surfaces are fermi points .",
    "we consider the generic situation that fermi points have @xmath63 ( not counting spin in class ci ) ; a fermi point with a higher @xmath68 splits into fermi points with @xmath63 upon a slight deformation of @xmath46 .",
    "we start with class diii and ci .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath69 is not a trim . taking a loop around @xmath69 , and the momentum reversed of this loop around @xmath70 ,",
    "calculating the phase winding of @xmath71 on these loops , we immediately find that @xmath41 of a fermi point at @xmath69 and at @xmath72 is the same .",
    "what happens if @xmath69 is a trim ? for class ci , for each point on a circle centered at a trim , the determinant of @xmath14 at the antipodal points of the circle agree , leading to an even winding number .",
    "thus , if there is a fermi point at a trim , a deformation of @xmath14 splits it into fermi points off the trim , leading us back to a case satisfying our original assumption .",
    "the same reasoning can be applied for class diii , provided that @xmath46 is even dimensional .",
    "this is guaranteed if @xmath73 admits a spin@xmath2eh structure , since it implies that its dimension is a multiple of four . for class aiii ,",
    "if there is a fermi point at @xmath21 for spin up , there is an other at @xmath67 for spin down .",
    "if the conditions for zero net winding hold , each vortex should have its antivortex ( for class aiii , for each spin separately ) .",
    "it follows from our preceding discussion that the momentum reversed pairs can not be also the antivortex pairs . starting from a fermi point at @xmath21 , we thus immediately obtain three other .",
    "that is , the combination of eqs .   with our findings regarding the topology of fermi points",
    "has led us to a result analogous to the fermion doubling theorem:@xcite the number of fermi points is a multiple of four ; for class ci each fermi point is spin degenerate ( i.e. , we have a multiple of eight including spin ) , for class aiii , the number of fermi points is a multiple of two for each spin .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "conjectures a similar result , stating that the number of fermi points is an even multiple of the minimal number of dirac cones in a given symmetry class .",
    "this agrees with our findings for classes aiii and ci , but it gives the number of fermi points to be a multiple of two for class diii . with our proof at hand we see that this is not possible in models with a spin@xmath2eh structure .",
    "a two dimensional surface separating topological superconductors with different bulk topological invariants @xmath74 and @xmath75 is known to support topologically protected fermi points.@xcite ( the theory for the low energy excitations on the surface defines a two dimensional @xmath3-invariant superconductor model , hence its gapless modes form fermi points . )",
    "considerations based on three dimensional dirac models@xcite suggest the number of surface fermi points to be @xmath76 .",
    "this equality can not hold in all cases : while @xmath77 is a topological invariant , i.e. , it can not change under deformations ( which do not close the gap ) , the number of surface fermi points is not , as such deformations are allowed to add or remove vortex - antivortex pairs in the surface theory .",
    "note , however , that similarly to the violation of the fermion doubling theorem on the surface of a topological insulator,@xcite the fermion quadrupling theorem can be violated in the above domain wall by allowing the fermi points to have a nonzero net winding number @xmath78 ( i.e. , it is possible to have vortices without antivortex pairs ) .",
    "this number , as it is quantized in integer values , also can not change by continuous deformations of the theory : it is also a topological invariant .",
    "( stated in another way , @xmath78 measures the number of _ unpaired _ vortices ; this clearly can not change by adding or removing vortex - antivortex _",
    "pairs_. ) it is tempting to look for an `` index theorem '' relating these topological invariants . for this relation",
    ", we can use the results from the dirac models as a reference . for a domain wall in the @xmath79 plane with @xmath80 ,",
    "the @xmath76 fermi points of the surface theory are characterized@xcite by a @xmath46 equivalent to @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .",
    "importantly , all fermi points are unpaired : they all have identical unitary winding @xmath83 .",
    "the net winding is thus @xmath84 providing us with the index theorem we were looking for .",
    "this equation , due to the topological invariance of both sides , holds irrespective to the possible changes in the total number of surface fermi points . for this total number ,",
    "assuming again that all fermi points have , @xmath76 sets the minimum : once all the fermi points are unpaired , their number can not be further reduced by pair annihilation .",
    "this also immediately explains the topological protection of the gapless surface states .    as a special case , eq .",
    "includes the surface of a topological superconductor , i.e , an interface between a topological superconductor ( @xmath85 ) and the vacuum ( @xmath86 ) . in this case",
    ", the significance of our index theorem is that it gives a direct measure of the _ bulk _ topological invariant of the superconductor in terms of a topological number for the _ surface _ degrees of freedom .",
    "it is worthwhile to go through the possible values of @xmath78 for the various symmetry classes in eq .  .",
    "our reasoning in sec .",
    "[ sec : quadrupling ] shows that @xmath78 is always even in class ci ( not counting spin ) .",
    "this is in accord with the observation@xcite that @xmath17 can take only even values in this symmetry class . for classes diii and aiii ( considering only one spin in the latter case )",
    ", @xmath17 can take any integer value .",
    "this is again in accord with our previous considerations if we note that for class diii , the surface theory model is not constrained to have a spin@xmath2eh structure .",
    "finally , our index theorem can be also viewed as completing an analogy between ( @xmath5-breaking ) chiral superconductors in two dimensions , and @xmath5-invariant topological superconductors in three dimensions . regarding bulk properties ,",
    "the two classes of systems are analogous in that both are characterized by a bulk topological invariant @xmath17 taking values in @xmath48 . for a domain wall in chiral superconductors",
    ", there is an index theorem@xcite equating @xmath77 with the number of unpaired edge states ( i.e. , the difference between the number of left moving and right moving modes in the domain wall ) .",
    "our index theorem with the number of unpaired fermi points on its left hand side thus nicely completes the analogy for the boundary degrees of freedom .",
    "in three dimensions , a @xmath37 dimensional fermi surface is a fermi line .",
    "we now prove our next result : the consequence of eqs .",
    "is that fermi lines come in pairs . while for class aiii , this is simply due to a fermi line with spin up having a pair with spin down , classes ci and diii deserve some discussion .",
    "we consider a lattice system with reciprocal unit cell defined by @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "( here @xmath89 are primitive reciprocal lattice vectors ) .",
    "the half cell bounded by the plane @xmath90 at @xmath91 and the face @xmath92 with @xmath93 is mapped to the other half of the cell upon @xmath94 .",
    "due to eqs .  , a fermi line located entirely in one of the half cells ( not intersecting @xmath95 nor @xmath96 ) has a pair in the other half cell",
    "the situation is not so clear for fermi lines intersecting @xmath97 and/or @xmath98 ; to prove our assertion we now show that in the generic situation a fermi line can not be its own pair under @xmath94 . first note the following facts : the trim of our reciprocal unit cell are on @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath97 , @xmath98 under @xmath94 is that of the two dimensional case , thus the intersection points with fermi lines have the earlier discussed properties of fermi points in two dimensions . in particular , generically there are no intersection points at trim .",
    "now assume that there is a fermi line which is its own pair , which intersects @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the set of points @xmath99 ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) .",
    "consider the pair of points @xmath102 , @xmath103 with winding number @xmath41 .",
    "take two parametrizations of the line , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "since the fermi line is a vortex , for a given parametrization , fermi points on @xmath90 , @xmath96 with like charges are pierced from the same direction ( always from above or always from below ) .",
    "as @xmath102 and @xmath103 have the same charges and since @xmath109 pierces @xmath103 from the opposite direction to how @xmath110 pierces @xmath102 , @xmath110 and @xmath109 parametrize the line with opposite orientation .",
    "thus the two parametrizations must run into each other at some @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , which implies that @xmath113 is a trim , which does not happen in the generic situation .",
    "this thus proves that lines come in pairs also for classes diii and ci . while for class ci , it would also possible , as for class aiii , to define pairs in terms of spin , as we saw ,",
    "more can be said : there are spin degenerate pairs of lines .",
    "note that in our proof we have not used the criterion of zero net winding .",
    "this however does not lead to further doubling of the number of lines , as it can be satisfied for example with pair of fermi loops .",
    "a topological phase transition , i.e. , a transition between gapped phases with different bulk topological invariant @xmath17 proceeds through a gapless phase.@xcite if the gapless phase can support topologically stable fermi surfaces , it is expected to be a stable region in parameter space;@xcite small variations of the system parameters should not lead out of it . in earlier models of topological superconductors,@xcite however , topologically distinct gapped phases are directly adjacent to each other in parameter space ; a slight deformation of a gapless system on the phase boundary between them immediately leads to one of the gapped phases .",
    "the gapless phase is thus unstable . as a final application ,",
    "we show how the existence of topologically stable fermi lines can modify this situation .",
    "we consider the class ci model of schnyder _",
    "et al_,@xcite constructed for the diamond lattice .",

    "[ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "the system is gapless on the lines @xmath122 , with the gap closing occurring at momenta @xmath123 .",
    "gapless systems belong to an unstable region in parameter space : a slight change for example in @xmath121 immediately opens a gap .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that the model satisfies @xmath124 where @xmath125 are pauli matrices in the grading of eq .  .",
    "consequently , @xmath126 , thus the space of invertible @xmath46 matrices is @xmath127 . as ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "the model is indeed not expected to have stable gapless phases . with eq .",
    "in addition to eq .  , the model has more symmetries than required for belonging to class ci ( i.e. , it is `` not generic '' )",

    "with the current interest in topological insulators and superconductors , the role of the block offdiagonal structure [ eq .  ] in the literature so far has been in the topological characterization of gapped phases of @xmath5-invariant superconductors . in this work we asked : what can be deduced from eq .",
    "regarding the nature of gapless phases of these systems ? focusing on systems in @xmath19 , our central finding is that eq",
    ".   leads to the possibility of @xmath37 dimensional topologically stable fermi surfaces , characterized by an integer topological charge @xmath41 .",
    "these fermi surfaces can be envisioned as momentum space vortices in @xmath45 as an `` order parameter '' : in @xmath0 , they are points ( in @xmath1 they are lines ) in momentum space where @xmath45 vanishes and their topological charge is calculated by the phase winding of @xmath45 around them .",
    "this result , combined with the momentum reversal relations in eq .  , leads to a `` fermion quadrupling theorem '' : the number of fermi points for @xmath0 lattice models with a spin@xmath2eh structure is a multiple of four .",
    "our analogous finding for @xmath1 systems is that fermi lines come in pairs .",
    "the most well known manifestation of the fermion quadrupling theorem is provided by the four fermi points of a d - wave superconductor , and an example for a pair of fermi lines is present in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor cept@xmath144si.@xcite    in sec .",
    "[ sec : fsandq ] we have seen that our results provide a straightforward topological explanation for the robustness of the fermi points of a d - wave superconductor against a weak spin - orbit coupling or against an admixture of a ( time - reversal invariant ) triplet pairing component .",
    "in addition , our considerations regarding two dimensional lattice systems can find applications similar to the work of berg _",
    "et al_@xcite who studied the perturbative stability of fermi points in the presence of a ( weak ) coexisting order , with a periodicity commensurate with the lattice . for a @xmath5-invariant coexisting order , the authors of ref",
    ".   found that the fermi points can not be gapped out as long as the perturbation does not couple them to each other . with our topological considerations at hand",
    "we can say a little bit more : the fermi points are perturbatively unstable only if vortices are coupled to antivortices . in this case , the resulting fermi point in the folded brillouin zone has @xmath145 , which guarantees no topological stability ; it can be gapped out by the perturbation .",
    "if fermi points with like charges are coupled ( for example a momentum reversed pair of fermi points ) , the situation is different : in the folded brillouin zone the resulting fermi point has @xmath146 .",
    "all what the small perturbation can do is to split it up to more fermi points . due to the quadrupling theorem , in addition",
    ", we know that the perturbation can not remove only a single vortex - antivortex pair ; it has to reduce the number of fermi points by four .",
    "we have also found several implications of our findings to topological superconductors .",
    "for the surface of a topological superconductor , we have related the net winding @xmath78 to the bulk topological invariant @xmath17 in the form of an index theorem , eq .  .",
    "it accounts for the bulk topological properties in terms of a topological number for the boundary degrees of freedom , in perfect analogy to how the net number of chiral edge modes in a chiral superconductor accounts for the chern number@xcite ( the bulk topological invariant for chiral superconductors ) .",
    "eq .   tells us that @xmath17 fermi points on the surface are protected due to topological reasons , but it also shows that topology does not forbid to have more fermi points in the surface theory .",
    "these extra fermi points , if present , should be clearly visible , for example in the transport properties of the topological superconductor surface .    regarding the phase diagram for topological phase transitions , we have shown that generically , because of the presence of topologically stable fermi surfaces , there is an extended gapless region in parameter space separating gapped phases with different @xmath17  gapless systems thus represent a separate , stable phase themselves .",
    "this should be contrasted to the case where there can be no topologically stable fermi surfaces . in this case , gapless systems can only represent ( unstable ) phase boundaries .",
    "finally , we note that our results related to topological superconductors can be extended to a bit broader context than the domains considered so far .",

    "contain all the possibilities@xcite in the altland - zirnbauer classification@xcite for gapped three dimensional systems with @xmath147 , our results can be seen as pertaining to `` @xmath48-topological materials '' in @xmath1 , including chiral topological insulators@xcite in class aiii in addition to superconductor systems .",
    "second , as the key ingredient for the appearance of a stable gapless phase across a topological phase transition is the existence of topologically stable fermi surfaces , such gapless phases are expected to appear also in two dimensional @xmath3-invariant topological superconductors . in these systems , the stability of the gapless phase is provided by the topological stability of fermi points ."

    "<S> we show two implications of our findings for topological superconductors in @xmath1 : first , we relate the bulk topological invariant to a topological number for the surface fermi points in the form of an index theorem . </S>",
    "<S> second , we show that the existence of topologically stable fermi lines results in extended gapless regions in a generic topological superconductor phase diagram . </S>"
