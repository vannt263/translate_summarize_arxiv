    "exchange bias ( eb ) is a well known effect resulting from the exchange coupling at the interface between a ferromagnet ( f ) and an antiferromagnet ( af ) , once they are cooled through the ordering temperature of the latter .",
    "the key features of this mechanism are a shift and an enlargement of the magnetic hysteresis cycles of the system , compared to the ones corresponding to the single - f layer , which is in general accompanied by the so - called training effect . an extensive picture of eb is presented in several reviews devoted to this subject @xcite .",
    "the eb effect is indeed observed in a large number of exchange coupled materials , such as conventional af / f , ferrimagnet ( ferri)/f @xcite , and spin glass ( sg)/f @xcite systems , fabricated in a wide variety of forms , like nanoparticles , thin films , single crystals , and granular and disordered media . however , despite the large number of works devoted to the study of eb , the research in this field is far from being accomplished . since its discovery @xcite",
    ", this phenomenon kept on gaining great attention due to its applications , mainly in magnetic storage and memory devices @xcite , but , also more recently , in the realization of superconducting spin switch valves @xcite . in this sense",
    "the fabrication of artificial thin films hybrids represents a unique tool to design systems with tunable coercive fields and pinning strength and to explore eb in several coupled materials .",
    "this research is also moved forward by the continuous developments in the fabrication techniques , which make possible the reliable realization of complex heterostructures consisting of layers of different materials only a few nanometers thick .",
    "however , the performance of these devices crucially depends on a large number of specific characteristics , such as interface properties ( roughness , interdiffusion ) , crystallinity , and grain size @xcite .    in this paper the magnetic properties of double exchange biased systems consisting in df / f / af",
    "trilayers are reported . here",
    "df is a diluted magnetic cumn alloy , with composition cu@xmath0mn@xmath1 , f is permalloy ( py @xmath2 ni@xmath3fe@xmath4 ) , that is a soft ferromagnet , and af is a native thermal oxide , namely hematite ( @xmath2 @xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 ) , due to the natural oxidation of py .",
    "this system enables one to explore the pinning exerted on the interleaved py film by the external layers in which two different orderings are present .",
    "several reasons make this kind of systems interesting .",
    "so far , the only work reporting on eb in cu@xmath9mn@xmath10/f bilayers @xcite revealed unusual effects related to the sg nature of the cumn layer , such as an inversion of the bias field in a well defined temperature region .",
    "the same result was also confirmed in a sg / f system where aufe was the sg pinning layer @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the problem working on the diluted side of the cumn phase diagram where , as it will be seen in the following , the magnetic behavior is dominated by frustrated clusters and therefore the system can not be considered a canonical sg . on the other hand ,",
    "hematite is considered very attractive for eb applications because of both large giant magnetoresistance ratios and high bulk nel temperature @xcite . in particular , being the hematite layer a native oxide film here , the resulting trilayer comes effectively from the fabrication of only two layers .",
    "finally , the proposed trilayers can provide a controllable twisted spin structure @xcite , which could be interesting for the realization of spin - based devices .",
    "this work is organized as follows . after a brief description of the samples fabrication , the results of their characterization both by high- and",
    "low - angle x - ray measurements are presented .",
    "a preliminary detailed magnetic characterization was performed on single cumn films , as well as on protected and unprotected py films .",
    "the central part of the paper is devoted to the investigation of the exchange bias and coercivity of cumn / py/@xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 trilayers as a function of the cumn thickness . from these measurements",
    "the values of the interfacial exchange energies for the two pinning layers , namely cumn and @xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 , are evaluated .",
    "a negative exchange field is reported in an intermediate cumn thickness range and in a well defined temperature window .",
    "cumn / py bilayers were deposited on si(100 ) substrates by uhv dc diode magnetron sputtering at room temperature , at a base pressure in the low @xmath11 mbar range and at processing ar pressure of 3@xmath12@xmath13 mbar .",
    "the typical deposition rates were 0.18 nm / s for cumn and 0.24 nm / s for py , as measured by a quartz crystal monitor previously calibrated by low - angle x - ray reflectivity measurements ( xrr ) on deliberately deposited thin films of each material .",
    "samples have constant py thickness ( @xmath14 = 12 nm ) and variable cumn ones ( @xmath15 nm ) . in order to obtain samples under identical deposition conditions",
    "four different substrates were loaded in the deposition chamber . a movable protecting shutter driven by a computer controlled step motor allows to fabricate hybrids having one layer with constant thickness , changing the thickness of the other as desired .",
    "after the deposition of the cumn / py bilayers , the samples were exposed to atmospheric pressure at room temperature .",
    "as it as been unambiguously demonstrated , the thermal oxidation of the external py film exposed to the laboratory environment produces an @xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 surface af layer @xcite . indeed , according to the fe - o phase diagram @xcite",
    ", @xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 is the stable phase at room temperature and atmospheric pressure .",
    "therefore we can assert that the final structure of the investigated sample is cumn / py/@xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "single py and cumn films of various thicknesses were also fabricated for reference . in order to perform a comparative study to discern the role played by the hematite layer ,",
    "single py films with a protective nb cap layer , 2-nm - thick , were also prepared .",
    "all depositions were performed in zero magnetic field .",
    "energy dispersion spectroscopy ( eds ) analysis confirmed the nominal mn concentration of the cumn sputtering target source , namely 0.01 , in the deposited films .      in order to investigate the interface quality and the layering of the structures ,",
    "preliminary xrr measurements were performed on selected samples using a philips xpert - mrd high resolution diffractometer equipped with a four - circle cradle and a cuk@xmath16 source .",
    "moreover , it is well established that xrr provides high sensitivity to thin surface layers and therefore it can return information concerning the composition of the surface oxide layer . technical details concerning the measurements can be found elsewhere @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ xrr ] the specular xrr profile of a cumn / py/@xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 trilayer is shown .",
    "the data ( circles ) are treated quantitatively by computer - aided simulation ( line ) @xcite in order to extract values for interface roughness , layer thickness , and external layer composition .",
    "in particular , the experimental profile is not compatible with the presence of a surface ni oxide , while it is satisfactorily reproduced by a theoretical model which uses the layer thicknesses and the corresponding root - mean - square roughnesses as fitting parameters .",
    "such model allowed to obtain @xmath17 = 38.7 nm , @xmath14 = 14.7 nm , and @xmath18 = 1.2 nm for the thicknesses , and @xmath19 = 0.6 nm , @xmath20 = 1.5 nm , and @xmath21 = 0.5 nm for the roughnesses .",
    "this result confirms the presence of the most stable fe oxide , @xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 , on top of the py layer , and returns values for the hematite thickness which are consistent with compositional depth profiles determined by x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) on unprotected py films @xcite .",
    "moreover xrr reveals smooth interfaces , which promote an efficient exchange coupling between the different layers @xcite .",

    "high - angle @xmath22 - 2@xmath22 measurements were performed using a standard x - ray powder diffractometer with cuk@xmath16 radiation in order to study the crystallographic orientation of the different layers .",
    "the diffraction patterns acquired for the cumn / py/@xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 trilayers ( not reported here ) indicate that both cu and py present an fcc oriented growth in the ( 111 ) direction and show , in the limit of our experimental accuracy , that no other crystallographic phases are present in the samples .",
    "finally , the experimental data do not show any peak related to the presence of either the thin @xmath5-fe@xmath6o@xmath7 layer or the extremely diluted mn atoms .",
    "all the magnetic measurements reported in this subsection and in the following were performed in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer @xcite with the magnetic field always applied parallel to the substrate plane . to address the problem of the sample positioning with respect to the magnetometer pick - up coils , prior to all the data acquisition a centering procedure ( at @xmath23 = 5 k and in a magnetic field that never exceeded @xmath24 500 oe ) was performed . the temperature",
    "was then increased to @xmath23 = 100 k and magnetic hysteresis cycles , @xmath25 , were measured at different temperatures cooling the samples in a field of -500 oe down to each target temperature .",
    "the samples were always heated up to @xmath23 = 100 k between two subsequent magnetic cycles .",
    "a magnetic characterization of single cumn films was preliminary performed .",
    "cumn was chosen among others because it is a well studied system whose properties had been investigated in a broad range of compositions @xcite , spanning from diluted @xcite to concentrated regimes @xcite with a particular focus on the sg ordering @xcite . as in all the sg alloys , the randomness in the position of the magnetic impurities and in the sign of the neighboring couplings in cumn generate frustration and random distribution of coupling strengths and directions below a freezing temperature , @xmath26 , and results in the well - known ruderman - kittel - kasuja - yosida ( rkky ) interaction @xcite . among many peculiar properties , concentrated sg alloys also exhibit eb intrinsically @xcite , an effect which was first explained by modelling the alloys as systems of mutually interacting f and af assemblages arising from inhomogeneous impurity distribution @xcite .",
    "indeed further studies revealed the formation of chemical clusters of mn atoms in cumn alloys @xcite , which can be thus described as an ensemble of fairly large f clusters interacting with each other in a randomized sg way @xcite .",
