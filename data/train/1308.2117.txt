    "<S> the continuing development of hollow - fiber technology towards single - cycle pulses with @xmath14mj energy is particularly important for relativistic laser - matter studies @xcite , and for the generation of more intense attosecond pulses . while larger diameter fibers are also a promising route to higher energy few - cycle pulses @xcite , the looser focusing conditions demand a significantly increased laboratory space for the apparatus in order to minimize nonlinear effects in the entrance and exit windows .    although stabilization of the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) is crucial to many experiments requiring few - cycle pulses with higher energies , the effect that energy scaling of hollow - fiber pulse compression has on the cep stability of the output pulses is yet to be investigated systematically . through self - phase modulation ( spm ) , </S>",

    "<S> the fiber becomes significant and will also contribute to the cep fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the possibility of an additional instability caused by gas flow in differentially pumped fibers has not yet been explored .    in this letter , we examine the energy scaling of the hollow - fiber compression technique in three commonly used modes of operation : statically - filled using linearly polarized pulses ( sflp ) ; differentially pumped using linearly polarized pulses ( dplp ) ; and statically - filled using cp pulses ( sfcp ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the cep stability of the fiber as a function of the input energy .    in our experiment , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15fs pulses with up to @xmath16mj energy at a 1khz repetition rate are generated by a commercial cpa system ( femtolasers gmbh , femtopower he cep ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cpa is cep stabilized using a photonic crystal fiber based _ f - to-2__f interferometer for fast - loop locking . </S>",
    "<S> the amplified pulses were delivered to a @xmath1 m inner - diameter , @xmath2 m long fiber filled with neon . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup is shown in fig.1 . to statically fill the fiber , both the entrance and exit tubes </S>",
    "<S> are filled with neon . </S>",
    "<S> differential pumping is achieved by evacuating the entrance tube , which is typically held at @xmath17 mbar when the exit tube is filled with @xmath18bar of neon . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath19 focusing mirror couples the beam into the fiber , and the output beam is recollimated using an @xmath20 cm mirror . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrally broadened pulses are compressed using 10 reflections from double - angle technology chirped - mirrors ( ultrafast innovations gmbh ) , and through fine - tuning of the group delay dispersion ( gdd ) with fused silica wedges . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse can be converted to circular polarization for propagation through the fiber by introducing a quarter - wave plate into the beam . </S>",

    "<S> since the spectrum from the hollow - fiber spans more than an octave , no additional spectral broadening is required within the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the pulses are focused into a beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal to double the long wavelength part of the spectrum . </S>",

    "<S> the input pulse energy was varied using a half - wave plate and polarizer before the compressor in the cpa , while the neon pressure was adjusted to maintain a spectrum with a sub-@xmath3fs fourier transform limit ( ftl ) at the output of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the output pulse energy is shown as a function of the input pulse energy in figure @xmath23(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> below an input pulse energy of @xmath0mj , the energy transmission for all configurations is close to the vacuum transmission at low energy ( @xmath22 ) . at input pulse energies above @xmath24mj , the output energy for sflp saturates at @xmath0mj . </S>",
    "<S> both sfcp and dplp permit significantly higher output pulse energies of up to @xmath4mj , but also show deviation from the vacuum transmission at high input pulse energies , and appear to be approaching saturation . </S>",

    "<S> therefore we investigate the cep stability as a function of input energy . </S>",

    "<S> modern cpa laser systems typically have output pulse energy fluctuations of around @xmath50 , which will cause fluctuations in the plasma density in the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the cep fluctuations induced as a consequence are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the peak intensity of the laser pulse , @xmath53 is a small change in the pulse peak intensity , and @xmath54 is the gas pressure . </S>",
    "<S> pulse energy fluctuations can also induce a cep instability associated with spm , through the mechanism described in @xcite . in order to model the cep fluctuations induced by the fiber </S>",
    "<S> , we have simulated our experiments using a coupled - mode , split - step technique incorporating modal dispersion and loss , the kerr effect including self - steepening , and ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization rate was calculated using the ammosov , delone and krainov theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions were the experimentally measured laser temporal profile , and a gaussian spatial profile with an optimal @xmath55 diameter of @xmath56 m . </S>",
    "<S> the gas pressure was varied with input energy in order to maintain a constant broadening factor , as prescribed by equation 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the input pulses were assumed to have @xmath50 energy fluctuations and @xmath57mrad cep fluctuations , which is the typical performance of our laser system . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations were performed for dplp , where in - coupling effects due to ionization and self - focusing of the beam can be neglected due to the low gas pressure ( @xmath58 mbar ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure @xmath18 shows the standard deviation of the cep measured after the fiber using dplp and sflp . </S>",
    "<S> the overall trend for both dplp and sflp is a degradation in the cep stability as the input pulse energy is increased , suggesting the onset of an ionization - induced cep instability . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the simulation are also shown in figure @xmath18 , and show excellent agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation confirms that the decrease in the cep stability as the input energy is increased from @xmath59mj to @xmath5mj is a consequence of ionization in the fiber . above @xmath5mj , further degradation in the cep stability </S>",
    "<S> is prevented by energy losses caused by ionization . without direct ionization losses ( which include the acceleration of ionized electrons ) , this roll - off remains present , and can therefore be attributed to ionization defocusing causing energy losses by coupling energy into higher order modes of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results show no significant difference in the cep stability using dplp compared to sflp , demonstrating for the first time that gas flow in differentially pumped fibers does not degrade the cep stability . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a dp fiber , the highest gas density is at the fiber exit . at the exit , mode attenuation will have decreased the peak intensity of the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> since the ionization - induced cep instability is linear with pressure , but extremely nonlinear with intensity , one might expect a cep stability improvement when using dplp compared to sflp , in parameter regimes where the ionization - induced cep instabilities are not prevented by propagation losses .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cep_longterm ]    mj compressed pulses , showing the square of the retrieved electric field ( red ) , and the intensity envelope ( blue ) with a fwhm duration of @xmath60fs . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental photoelectron ( pe ) kinetic energy spectrum as a function of the time delay between the ir and xuv pulses ( frog - crab trace ) is shown in the inset . </S>",
    "<S> the retrieved vector potential of the ir pulse is also shown ( black line ) . ]    for cep sensitive experiments in day - to - day operation we avoid operating the fiber at the maximum of cep fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> using e.g. @xmath13mj input pulse energy and dplp , we can achieve excellent long term cep stability after the fiber , as shown in figure 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the residual cep fluctuations have a standard deviation of @xmath61mrad , again confirming that the cep stability of differentially pumped fibers is sufficient for attosecond experiments . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the full characterization of these pulses in figure @xmath3(c ) was achieved through attosecond streaking , which requires excellent cep stability . </S>",
    "<S> attosecond streaking using the few - cycle infrared ( ir ) pulses and isolated attosecond extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) pulses was performed in a neon gas jet , using the setup described in detail in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62mj compressed pulses have a duration of @xmath60fs , and were fully characterized using the vector potential retrieved from the frog - crab trace , as described in @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the output pulse energy from a @xmath1 m inner - diameter hollow - fiber saturates at @xmath0mj with the fiber statically filled with neon , and that the output pulse energy can be increased to @xmath4mj by using either differential pumping , or cp pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an overall degradation in the cep stability as the input pulse energy is increased , which is the consequence of increased ionization within the fiber . for our experimental parameters , </S>",
    "<S> ionization losses prevent further degradation of the cep stability above @xmath5mj input pulse energies . </S>",
    "<S> however , this instability should be carefully considered when scaling hollow - fiber pulse compression to multi - millijoule energies . if the peak intensity is held constant by increasing the fiber inner diameter , the highly - nonlinear scaling of tunnel ionization with intensity can be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have presented the first direct evidence that the cep stability performance of differentially pumped fibers can be equivalent to that of statically filled fibers . </S>",
    "<S> we have generated @xmath62mj , @xmath60fs pulses with a cep stability of @xmath63mrad over @xmath64h using a differentially pumped fiber , showing that the long term cep stability of differentially pumped fibers is sufficient for attosecond experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this work to aid the design of multi - millijoule hollow fiber systems where cep stability is required . </S>"
