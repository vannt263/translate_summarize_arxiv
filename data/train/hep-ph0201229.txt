    "the cross section for bottom - quark production at hadron collider energies exceeds the central value of predictions of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) by about a factor of two.@xcite this longstanding discrepancy has resisted fully satisfactory resolution within the standard model.@xcite the nlo contributions are large , and it is not excluded that a combination of further higher - order effects in production and/or fragmentation may resolve the discrepancy .",
    "however , the disagreement is surprising because the relatively large mass of the bottom quark sets a hard scattering scale at which fixed - order perturbative qcd computations of other processes are generally successful .",
    "the photoproduction cross section at desy s hera@xcite and and the cross section in photon - photon reactions at cern s lep@xcite also exceed nlo expectations .",
    "the data invite the possibility of a contribution from ",
    "the properties of new particles that can contribute significantly to the bottom quark ( @xmath0 ) cross section are fairly well circumscribed . to be produced with enough cross section the particles must interact strongly and have relatively low mass .",
    "they must either decay into @xmath0 quarks or be close imitators of @xmath0 s in a variety of channels of observation .",
    "they must evade constraints based on precise data from measurements of @xmath1 decays at cern s lep and slac s slc , and from many lower - energy @xmath2 collider experiments .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a favorite candidate for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it offers a well - motivated theoretical framework and is reasonably well - explored phenomenologically .",
    "an explanation within the context of the mssm can satisfy all of the stated criteria.@xcite the existence is assumed of a relatively light color - octet gluino @xmath3 ( mass @xmath4 to 16 gev ) that decays with 100% branching fraction into a bottom quark @xmath0 and a light color - triplet bottom squark @xmath5 ( mass @xmath6 to 5.5 gev ) .",
    "the @xmath3 and the @xmath5 are the spin-1/2 and spin-0 supersymmetric partners of the gluon ( @xmath7 ) and bottom quark . in this scenario",
    "the @xmath5 is the lightest susy particle , and the masses of all other susy particles are arbitrarily heavy , i.e. , of order the electroweak scale or greater .",
    "( the @xmath5 either lives long enough to escape from a typical collider detector or decays promptly via r - parity violation into a pair of hadronic jets . )",
    "improved agreement is obtained with hadron collider rates of bottom - quark production , and several predictions are made that can be tested readily with forthcoming data .",
    "the light gluinos are produced in pairs via standard qcd subprocesses , dominantly @xmath8 at tevatron and large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies .",
    "the @xmath3 has a strong color coupling to @xmath0 s and @xmath5 s and , as long as its mass satisfies @xmath9 , the @xmath3 decays promptly to @xmath10 .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath0 cross section , the shape of the @xmath0 s transverse momentum @xmath11 distribution , and the cdf measurement@xcite of @xmath12 mixing are three features of the data that help to establish the preferred masses of the @xmath3 and @xmath5 . shown in fig .  1 is the integrated @xmath11 distribution of the @xmath0 quarks that results from @xmath13 , for @xmath1414 gev and @xmath15 3.5 gev .",
    "the results are compared with the cross section obtained from next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd and cteq4 m parton distribution functions ( pdfs),@xcite with @xmath16 4.75 gev , and a renormalization and factorization scale @xmath17 .",
    "susy - qcd corrections to @xmath18 production are not included as they are not available and are generally expected to be smaller than the standard qcd corrections . the @xmath3-pair cross section is computed from the leading order ( lo ) matrix element with nlo pdfs,@xcite @xmath19 , and a two - loop expression for the strong coupling @xmath20 . to account for nlo effects ,",
    "this @xmath3-pair cross section is multiplied by 1.9 , the ratio of inclusive nlo to lo cross sections.@xcite    a relatively light gluino is necessary in order to obtain a bottom - quark cross section comparable in magnitude to the pure qcd component",
    ". values of @xmath21 12 to 16 gev are chosen because the resulting @xmath22 decays produce @xmath11 spectra that are enhanced primarily in the neighborhood of @xmath23 where the data show the most prominent enhancement above the qcd expectation .",
    "larger values of @xmath24 yield too little cross section to be of interest , and smaller values produce more cross section than seems tolerated by the ratio of like - sign to opposite - sign leptons from @xmath0 decay , as discussed below .",
    "the choice of @xmath25 has an impact on the kinematics of the @xmath0 .",
    "after selections on @xmath26 , large values of @xmath25 reduce the cross section and , in addition , lead to shapes of the @xmath11 distribution that agree less well with the data .",
    "after the contributions of the nlo qcd and susy components are added , the magnitude of the bottom - quark cross section and the shape of the integrated @xmath27 distribution are described well .",
    "very good agreement is obtained also with data from the ua1 experiment ( not shown).@xcite the susy process produces bottom quarks in a four - body final state and thus their momentum correlations are different from those of qcd .",
    "angular correlations between muons that arise from decays of @xmath0 s have been measured.@xcite the angular correlations between @xmath0 s in the susy case are nearly indistinguishable from those of qcd once experimental cuts are applied .",
    "the energy dependence of the bottom cross section is a potentially important constraint on models in which new physics is invoked to interpret the observed excess bottom quark yield .",
    "since the assumed @xmath28 mass is larger than the mass of the @xmath0 , the @xmath28 pair process will turn on more slowly with energy than pure qcd production of @xmath18 pairs .",
    "the new physics contribution will depress the ratio of cross sections at 630 gev and 1.8 tev from the pure qcd expectation .",
    "an explicit calculation with cteq4 m parton densities and the @xmath0 rapidity selection @xmath29 , yields a pure qcd prediction at nlo of 0.17 + /-",
    "0.02 for @xmath30 10.5 gev , and 0.16 + /-",
    "0.02 after inclusion of the gluino pair contribution .",
    "either of these numbers is consistent with forthcoming data from cdf on this ratio.@xcite      since the @xmath3 is a majorana particle , its decay yields both quarks and antiquarks .",
    "gluino pair production and subsequent decay to @xmath0 s will generate @xmath31 and @xmath32 pairs , as well as the @xmath33 final states that appear in qcd production .",
    "when a gluino is highly relativistic , its helicity is nearly the same as its chirality .",
    "therefore , selection of @xmath3 s whose transverse momentum is greater than their mass will reduce the number of like - sign @xmath0 s . in the intermediate @xmath34 region , however , the like - sign suppression is reduced .",
    "the cuts chosen in current hadron collider experiments for measurement of the ratio of like - sign to opposite - sign muons result in primarily unpolarized @xmath3 s , and , independent of the @xmath5 mixing angle , an equal number of like - sign and opposite - sign @xmath0 s is expected at production .",
    "the susy mechanism leads therefore to an increase of like - sign leptons in the final state after semi - leptonic decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath35 quarks .",
    "this increase could be confused with an enhanced rate of @xmath36 mixing .",
    "time - integrated mixing analyses of lepton pairs observed at hadron colliders are interpreted in terms of the quantity @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the fractions of @xmath40 and @xmath41 hadrons in the sample of semi - leptonic @xmath42 decays , and @xmath43 is the time - integrated mixing probability for @xmath44 .",
    "conventional @xmath45 pair production determines the quantity @xmath46 , the fraction of @xmath45 pairs that decay into like - sign leptons .",

    "the predictions are @xmath59 for @xmath58 14 gev , and @xmath60 with @xmath58 16 gev .",
    "additional theoretical uncertainties arise because there is no fully differential nlo calculation of gluino production and subsequent decay to @xmath0 s .",

    "an early study by the ua1 collaboration@xcite excludes @xmath28 s in the mass range @xmath64 gev , but it starts from the assumption that there is a light neutralino @xmath65 whose mass is less than the mass of the gluino .",
    "the conclusion is based on the absence of the expected decay @xmath66 , where @xmath67 represents the missing energy associated with the @xmath65 . in the scenario",
    "discussed above , this decay process does not occur since the bottom squark is the lsp , the susy particle with lowest mass , and the @xmath65 mass is presumed to be large ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath68 gev ) .",
    "an analysis of 2- and 4-jet events by the aleph collaboration@xcite disfavors @xmath3 s with mass @xmath69 gev but not @xmath3 s in the mass range relevant for the susy interpretation of the bottom quark production cross section .",

    "the exclusion by the cleo collaboration@xcite of a @xmath5 with mass 3.5 to 4.5 gev does not apply since their analysis focuses only on the decays @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    ", these data might be reinterpreted in terms of a bound on the r - parity violating lepton - number violating decay of @xmath5 into @xmath73 .",
    "it would be interesting to study the hadronic decays @xmath74 , with @xmath75 or @xmath76 , and @xmath77 with the cleo data .",

    "the combined ranges of @xmath70 and @xmath28 masses are also compatible with renormalization group equation constraints and the absence of color and charge breaking minima in the scalar potential.@xcite    there are important restrictions on couplings of the bottom squarks from precise measurements of @xmath80 decays .",
    "a light @xmath5 would be ruled out unless its coupling to the @xmath80 is very small .",
    "the squark couplings to the @xmath80 depend on the mixing angle @xmath81 .",
    "if the light bottom squark ( @xmath82 ) is an appropriate mixture of left - handed and right - handed bottom squarks , its lowest - order ( tree - level ) coupling to the @xmath80 can be arranged to be small@xcite if @xmath83 . the couplings @xmath84 and @xmath85 survive , where @xmath86 is the heavier bottom squark . however , as long as the combination of the masses @xmath87 is less than the maximum center - of - mass energy explored at lep , these couplings present no difficulty .",
    "this condition implies roughly @xmath88 gev .",
    "however , much lower masses of @xmath89 might be tolerated .",
    "a careful phenomenological analysis is needed of expected @xmath86 decay signatures , along with an understanding of detection efficiencies and expected event rates , before one knows the admissible range of masses consistent with lep data . at higher - order ,",
    "unless the @xmath86 mass is of order 100 gev , contributions from loop processes in which light gluinos are exchanged may produce significant deviations from measurements of the ratios @xmath90 , the forward - backward @xmath0 asymmetry at the @xmath80 , and @xmath91 , the hadronic branching ratio of the @xmath80 into @xmath0 quarks.@xcite    bottom squarks make a small contribution to the inclusive cross section for @xmath92 hadrons , in comparison to the contributions from quark production , and @xmath93 resonances are likely to be impossible to extract from backgrounds.@xcite the angular distribution of hadronic jets produced in @xmath2 annihilation can be examined in order to bound the contribution of scalar - quark production .",

    "greater statistics would be valuable .",
    "if the bottom squark mass is less than half the mass of one of the upsilon states , then upsilon decay to a pair of bottom squarks might proceed with sufficient rate for experimental observation or exclusion of a light bottom squark .",

    "a precise determination of @xmath134 appears to be the best way to confirm or exclude the possible existence of a light gluino . using a method that relies heavily on a `` renormalization group invariant''(rgi ) technique to minimize non - perturbative and inverse - power contributions and scale dependence , members of the delphi collaboration@xcite extract the value @xmath135 from an analysis of data on the thrust distribution @xmath136 in @xmath137 over the energy range @xmath138 to 200 gev .",
    "a similar value for @xmath139 with somewhat larger uncertainties may be deduced from fits@xcite to the @xmath140 variation of @xmath141 .",

    "the small quoted uncertainty on @xmath144 would preclude a light gluino .",
    "however , it remains crucial to understand the assumptions and constraints inherent in the use of the rgi approach and to verify whether the same method applied to other event shape - variables yields consistent results for @xmath144 .    in the standard model , a global fit to all observables",

    "the value @xmath147 describes most observables properly.@xcite extrapolation from @xmath146 to a lower scale @xmath148 with inclusion of a light gluino reduces @xmath111 from its pure qcd value .",
    "the presence of a light gluino , with or without a light bottom squark , also requires reanalysis of the phenomenological determinations of @xmath111 at all scales to take into account susy processes and susy - qcd corrections to the amplitudes that describe the relevant processes . to date , a systematic study of this type has not been undertaken , but , as mentioned above , consistency is achieved for @xmath95 decays .",
