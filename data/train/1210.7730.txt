    "psr j1048@xmath05832 was detected with the _ rntgen satellite _  ( _ rosat _ ) at 0.12.4 kev ( becker et al .",
    "soon after , observations with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _  ( _ asca _ ) found possible evidence of extended x - ray emission ( pivoravoff et al .",
    "2000 ) , possibly associated with a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "high - resolution observations with the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory , indeed revealed the presence of an asymmetric pwn around the pulsar .",
    "no x - ray pulsed emission has been detected so far by both _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ , and a 3@xmath23 upper limit of 53@xmath24 on the pulsed fraction between 0.5 and 10 kev has been determined ( gonzales et al .",

    "the _ chandra _   data of  ( marelli 2012 ) could separate the pulsar emission from that of its pwn . see marelli ( 2012 ) for details on the observations and data analysis .",
    "the combined _ chandra _  plus _ xmm - newton _  spectrum of the pulsar is fitted by a power - law ( pl ) with photon index @xmath25=1.35@xmath220.45 and @xmath26=@xmath27 @xmath28 , corresponding to an unabsorbed x - ray flux @xmath29=@xmath30 erg @xmath28 s@xmath5 in the 0.310 kev energy range .",

    "( 2006 ) tried to separate the pulsar and pwn components and derived a pulsar photon index @xmath31 ( quoted without uncertainties ) from the fit to the combined _ chandra _  plus _ xmm - newton _  spectrum .",
    "our results differ from theirs since we used data from all the _ xmm - newton _  detectors ( both the epic - pn and mos ) and fitted the combined spectrum using the c - statistic approach in xspec .",
    "this allowed us to more efficiently separate the pulsar and pwn components in our spectral analysis and derive more accurate values for the pulsar photon index .",
    "moreover , we used slightly different radii to extract the pulsar counts : 20   instead of 25  for the _ xmm - newton _  data , and 2   instead of 1  for the _ chandra _  data .",
    "psr j1048@xmath05832 was initially proposed by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as the counterpart of the unidentified @xmath2-ray source 3eg j1048@xmath05840 , detected above 400 mev by the egret instrument aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _  ( _ cgro _ ) .",
    "more recently , the large area telescope  ( _ lat _ ) aboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope detected for the first time @xmath2-ray pulsations above 100 mev from this pulsar ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) , highlighting a clear , double - peaked pulse profile very similar to the vela pulsar .",

    "the r - band images of   were obtained with the vlt  antu telescope at the eso paranal observatory between december 4 , 2010 and january 5 , 2011 ( see tab .  1 ) and are available in the eso archive under programme i d 384.d-0386(a ) and 386.d-0585(a ) . all observations were performed in service mode with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 , appenzeller et al .",

    "all these values are computed by the fors2  pipeline and are available through the fors2   data - quality control database . for the average science image we assumed the average airmass computed over all the exposures .",
    "we estimated that the effects of the airmass variation over the different exposures ( 0.11 rms ) and the variation of the extinction coefficient ( 0.012 rms ) over the four nights introduce an uncertainty of only 0.05 magnitudes on our photometry .",
    "+ the astrometric solution of the fors2 frame is based on the coordinates of the guide star used for the pointing . in order to improve the accuracy of the pulsar position on the frame , we recomputed the astrometric solution using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) all - sky catalog of point sources ( skrutskie et al .",
    "since the brightest stars in the field are saturated , we selected a subsample of 32 fainter , non - saturated reference stars , by excluding those at clearly bad position , e.g. close to the ccd edges .",
    "we then measured the star centroids through gaussian fitting using the graphical astronomy and image analysis ( gaia ) tool .",
    "we also used gaia astrometric fitting routines to compute the pixel - to - sky coordinate transformation , which also account for the ccd distortions .",
    "the rms of the astrometric fits was @xmath43 in the radial direction .",

    "( 1997 ) , this is @xmath44=@xmath45 , where @xmath46=32 is the number of stars used to compute the astrometric solution , @xmath47=9 is the number of free parameters in the sky  to  image transformation model , and @xmath48 is the @xmath49 mean positional error of 2mass , which depends on the brightness of the reference stars .",
    "the selected 2mass reference stars have magnitudes @xmath50 , which corresponds to @xmath5102 ( skrutskie et al .",
    "we also accounted for the 0015 accuracy of the link of the 2mass coordinates to the international celestial reference frame ( skrutskie et al .",
    "thus , we estimated that the overall 1@xmath23 positional uncertainty of our fors2 astrometry is @xmath3018 . for consistency",
    ", we also recomputed the astrometry calibration of the fors2  v - band image of mignani et al .",
    "( 2011 ) using the 2mass catalog .",
    "the resulting rms of the astrometric fits was @xmath52016 , leading to an overall 1@xmath23 uncertainty on the v - band image of @xmath3019 .",
    "as done in mignani et al . ( 2011 ) , also in this work , we assumed as a reference both the _ chandra _  ( @xmath53=@xmath54 ; @xmath55=@xmath56 ( mjd= 52859 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2006 ) and radio interferometry ( @xmath53=@xmath57 ; @xmath55=@xmath58 ( mjd=50581 ; stappers et al .",
    "1999 ) positions that have radial positional uncertainties of 055 and 008 , respectively .",
    "these are shown in fig.[vlt ] , overlaid on the co - added fors2  r - band image ( mjd=55566 ) .",
    "our astrometry is consistent with that of mignani et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , although the accuracy on our revised fors2  astrometry is better due to the better positional accuracy of 2mass with respect to the gsc-2 ( lasker et al .",
    "as seen , there is no apparent candidate counterpart to  at the expected position .",
    "the object closest to the _ chandra _  position is star d of mignani et al .",
    "we measured its flux through standard aperture photometry , and obtained @xmath7=25.8@xmath220.2 , where the associated error accounts for statistical errors and the accuracy of the absolute fors2  flux calibration ( moheler et al .",
    "no other star is detected at the _ chandra _  position down to @xmath5926.4 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we ignore whether star d was the potential pulsar counterpart claimed by solleman & shibanov on the basis of the fors2  v - band data .",
    "nonetheless , since star d is also detected in the new fors2  r - band images , we used the whole data set to determine whether or not it can be a candidate counterpart to .",
    "star d ( @xmath6=26.7@xmath220.2 ) was ruled out by mignani et al .",
    "( 2011 ) as a possible counterpart to  because of its @xmath60 offset from the most recent _ chandra _  position of gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and an @xmath38% chance coincidence probability . however , since the time span between the _ chandra _   ( mjd=52859 ) and the fors2  @xmath6-band ( mjd=55237 ) observations is @xmath36.5 years , the actual pulsar position could have been closer to that of star d at the latter epoch , owing to its unknown proper motion . for instance , for a pulsar transverse velocity of 1200 km s@xmath5 , corresponding to a proper motion of @xmath61 yr@xmath5 at a 2.7 kpc distance , the  position could have been closer to that of star d by @xmath306 .",
    "such a velocity is about three times as large as the average transverse velocity of radio pulsars ( hobbs et al .",
    "pulsars with extreme velocities do exist , though , such as the guitar nebula pulsar , psr b2224 + 65 , whose transverse velocity could be as high as 1600 km s@xmath5 ( chatterjee & cordes 2004 ) .",
    "although the probability that  is moving at such an high velocity and exactly along a position angle of @xmath3210@xmath62 , i.e. that of the vector connecting the _ chandra _  position to that of star d , is small , we can not rule it out a priori . _",
    "if _ star d was the pulsar counterpart , it should then have the same proper motion as hypothesised for the pulsar .",
    "we used the fors2  @xmath6 and @xmath7-band images , separated by @xmath63 years , to measure a possible angular displacement of star d through relative astrometry .",
    "we registered the two images using standard tools in iraf , with an rms accuracy of @xmath3 0.05 pixel per coordinate .",
    "unfortunately , the faintness of star d prevented us to fits its centroid with an accuracy better than 0.2 pixel per coordinate and we could only set a @xmath49 upper limit of @xmath64 pixel on its displacement . accounting for the fors2 pixel scale ( 025 ) , this corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath65 yr@xmath5 on the star d proper motion . _",
    "if _ star d was the pulsar counterpart , this would only allow us to rule out a transverse velocity @xmath66 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we used the colour information on star d , now available , to further investigate its possible association with .",
    "star d has an observed @xmath67=0.9@xmath220.3 .",
    "we checked whether this colour would be compatible with a pulsar spectrum .",
    "we corrected the observed fluxes of star d assuming the reddening towards , computed from the hydrogen column density inferred from the x - ray spectral fits .",
    "the @xmath26 derived from the best fit to the _ chandra _  plus _ xmm - newton _  x - ray spectrum ( marelli 2012 ) corresponds to a reddening @xmath68=0.82@xmath220.04 according to the relation of predehl & schmitt  ( 1995 ) .",
    "this is much lower than the value inferred from the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum alone ( marelli et al .",
    "2011 ) , @xmath68=@xmath69 , and assumed by mignani et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in their analysis of the vlt  data . using the interstellar extinction coefficients of fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) , we derived @xmath70=2.55@xmath220.13 and @xmath71=1.91@xmath220.09 . thus , if star d were affected by the same extinction as the pulsar , its intrinsic colour would be @xmath72=0.26@xmath73 , i.e. its spectrum would be unconstrained .",
    "we note that the vela pulsar has @xmath74 - 0.3 ( mignani & caraveo 2001 ) , where the uncertainty due to the reddening correction for @xmath75 @xmath28 ( marelli et al .",
    "2011 ) is marginal , i.e. bluer than it would be for .",
    "however , vela has a flat pl spectrum in the optical ( mignani et al .",
    "2007 ) , whereas some pulsars might have steeper spectra that rise towards longer wavelengths , such as psr b0540@xmath069 ( mignani et al .",
    "2010a ) , which would yield colours redder than vela .",
    "thus , the colour of star d might not be incompatible with that of a pulsar .",
    "we note that the flux of star d would be incompatible with the expected optical emission of  extrapolated from the luminosity of the vela pulsar .",
    "has a spin - down luminosity @xmath76 erg s@xmath5 , a factor of 3 smaller than the vela pulsar ( @xmath77 erg s@xmath5 ) .",
    "moreover , it is at a larger distance ( 2.7@xmath220.35 kpc ) than vela ( 0.287@xmath220.02 kpc ; dodson et al .",
    "2003 ) and is affected by a factor of @xmath320 larger reddening .",
    "assuming that the   optical luminosity @xmath78 is the same fraction of the spin - down luminosity @xmath79 as the vela pulsar and accounting for the distance and reddening would then yield @xmath8032.2 .",
    "if star d were the  counterpart , this would emit in the optical up to @xmath81 of its spin - down luminosity .",
    "this value is @xmath82100 larger than the vela pulsar , and comparable to that of middle - aged and older pulsars ( zharikov et al .",
    "however , the evolution of the pulsar optical emission efficiency , @xmath83 , with the characteristic age is quite uncertain . in particular",
    ", this is true for spin - down ages between 10 and 100 krs , where vela is the only pulsar identified in the optical ( mignani 2011 ) .",
    "thus , we do not know whether the sharp decrease of @xmath84 observed for vela , which is only @xmath825 times older than the crab but has a @xmath821000 times lower efficiency , is peculiar of this object or is representative of all vela - like pulsars .",
    "indeed , the upper limits on the optical luminosity inferred for other vela - like pulsars ( e.g. , mignani et al .  1999 ; 2011 ; 2012 ) imply emission efficiencies @xmath85 , which would be consistent with that derived for  _ if _ star d was its optical counterpart .",
    "we investigated this association from the corresponding x - ray - to - optical flux ratio @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the unabsorbed _ chandra _  and vlt fluxes of  and star d , respectively .",
    "for the assumed reddening , the association with star d would imply , at most , an unabsorbed optical flux @xmath89 erg @xmath28 s@xmath5 and @xmath90100 .",
    "this value is much lower than expected from the comparison with other young rotation - powered pulsars ( e.g. , zharikov et al .",
    "2006 ) , for which the non - thermal , unabsorbed x - ray - to - optical flux ratio is always larger than @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we conclude that star d can not be the  counterpart .",
    "the r - band upper limit implies a flux @xmath920.46 @xmath93jy , corrected for the interstellar extinction .",
    "this flux value is quite close to that derived in the v band ( @xmath940.34 @xmath93jy ) .",
    "the optical flux upper limit on  imply , for the revised value of the interstellar absorption , an optical emission efficiency @xmath95 , accounting for the uncertainty on the @xmath26 and the pulsar distance .",
    "we compared the optical flux upper limits with the low - energy extrapolation of the x - ray and @xmath2-ray spectra ( fig.[sed ] ) .",
    "for the x - rays , we assumed the spectral model that fits the _ chandra _  plus _ xmm - newton _  data ( marelli 2012 ) , a pl with photon index @xmath25=1.35@xmath220.45 , while for the @xmath2-rays we assumed the pl with photon index @xmath96=1.38@xmath220.13 and exponential cut - off at @xmath32.3 gev that fits the _ fermi_/lat data ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) . as seen from fig.[sed ]",
    ", the extrapolation of the @xmath2-ray pl can be consistent with the x - ray pl spectrum .",
    "this changes the conclusions reported in mignani et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , based on the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum , where the presence of a spectral break between the x - rays and the @xmath2-rays was apparent . fig.[sed ] also shows that the optical flux upper limits are just above the extrapolation of the x - ray and @xmath2-ray spectra .",
    "this means that the multi - wavelength spectrum of  could be consistent with a single pl stretching from the @xmath2-rays to the optical ( see also durant et al .",
    "2011 ) , at variance with other _ fermi _ pulsars ( e.g. , mignani et al .  2010b ; 2011 ; 2012 ) , where there is evidence for spectral breaks between the pl components in the different energy bands , which are possibly representative of different energy and particle distributions .",
    "thus , the detection of  in the optical would be crucial to confirm this scenario .",
    "the new vlt observations of  confirm that the object detected closest to the _ chandra _  position ( star d ) is an unrelated field star .",
    "no other possible counterpart is detected down to @xmath5926.4 and @xmath3227.6 .",
    "thus ,  remains unidentified in the optical .",
    "it is clear that its detection is close to the sensitivity limit of 8m - class telescopes .",
    "observations at longer wavelength might be more successful , though , were the optical / infrared spectrum of   follow the extrapolation of the x - ray pl .",
    "an updated _ chandra _  or radio position for  would allow one to minimise the position uncertainty due to the unknown pulsar proper motion and would represent an advantage in the search for its optical / infrared counterpart .",
