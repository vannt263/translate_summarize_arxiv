    "the balqsos are important in understanding the properties of quasars . in geometric models of quasars ,",

    "1999 ; schmidt & hines 1999 ; hall et al . 2002 ) or the polar direction ( zhou et al .",
    "other models place balqsos at the early stages of quasar evolution ( e.g. , hazard et al .",
    "1984 ; surdej & hutsemekers 1987 ; boroson & meyers 1992 ; becker et al .",
    "2000 ) .    under the recent paradigm of the co - evolution of agn and the host galaxies ,",
    "balqsos are expected to be a manifestation of the agn kinetic feedback , an energetic output that many recent theoretical models ( e.g. , granato et al . 2004 ) of galaxy evolution advocate to reproduce several observables such as the galaxy stellar mass function . in this scenario",
    "the majority of luminous agns must have undergone a wind phase and therefore a bal phase . on the other hand ,",
    "optical surveys have always detected a small fraction of balqsos within their sample .",
    "several studies of optically selected quasar samples indicate that the fraction of balqsos , @xmath10 is in the range of 10 - 22% ( e.g. , weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; tolea et al .",
    "2002 ; hewett & foltz 2003 ; reichard et al .",
    "2003 , r03 hereafter ) . in the radio bands ,",
    "recent first survey results show that the fraction of balqsos in radio selected quasars is about 1418% ( becker et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the infrared bands",
    ", there were hints of larger balqso fractions ( voit et al .",
    "1993 ; lipari 1994 ; egami et al .",
    "1996 ) , but the existing results are difficult to interpret due to the small sample size .",
    "special geometries of the outflows or short duty cycles have then been advocated to explain the deviation from expectations . however , there are other observational results suggesting larger fractions of balqsos .",
    "notably , in a gravitationally lensed quasar sample , chartas ( 2000 ) found a balqso fraction of 35% , however , the sample size was small .",
    "recently , trump et al .",
    "( 2006 , t06 hereafter ) identified more than 4,000 balqsos in the large sdss dr3 quasar sample ( schneider et al . 2005 ) , and found a balqso fraction of 26% .",
    "one important difficulty in estimation of the true balqso fraction is the selection bias caused by the uv spectral difference between balqsos and non - balqsos , which includes both absorption troughs and continuum differences ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; r03 ) .",
    "however , direct modelings of this selection bias lead to different correction factors ( e.g. , hewett & foltz 2003 ; r03 ) , though the issue is further complicated by different sample selections .",
    "alternatively , we can study the fraction of balqsos in a spectral regime that is not significantly affected by these biases to obtain the true fraction of balqsos . in this paper , we examine the population of balqsos in the near infrared by analyzing the large sample of sdss - balqsos ( t06 ) combining 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) data .",
    "we note that the balqso fraction also depends on the definition of balqsos used by different studies , and we adopt the definition used by t06 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 throughout the paper .",
    "we started from the sdss dr3 quasar catalog ( schneider et al . 2005 ) and the sdss - balqso catalog ( t06 ) .",
    "in particular , we targeted the redshift range of @xmath0 , where the majority of balqsos are identified with c  iv  absorption in the observed - frame optical band pass .",
    "we matched the quasars of both balqsos and non - balqsos ( 2 ) to entries from the full 2mass release .",
    "we note that not all database entries from the full 2mass release in the 2mass all - sky point source catalog ( psc ) satisfy the conservative requirements to be part of the official psc .",
    "therefore , the completeness of the database entries extend below the official psc completeness limits .",
    "the 99% completeness levels of the database are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16  mag . to ensure that matched database entries represent detections , we required an in - band detection ( rd_flg ! = 0 ) , that there was no confusion , contamination ( cc_flg = = 0 ) , or blending ( bl_flg @xmath17 1 ) in the source , and that no source was near an extended galaxy ( gal_contam = = 0 and ext_key is null ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : ik ] shows the @xmath2 mag versus @xmath18 mag distributions for balqsos and non - balqsos .",
    "the quasars are concentrated in a linear relation between the @xmath18 and @xmath2 magnitudes with scatter .",
    "the near infrared quasar sample is limited by the 2mass flux limits , rather than the sdss quasar selection .",
    "the first flux limit for sdss quasar selection is at @xmath19 , where quasars are selected in the @xmath20 color cube ( schneider et al . 2005 ) , and the 2mass sample fails to detect the majority of quasars at this sdss @xmath18 magnitude limit . about 5.2% of sdss quasars",
    "are detected in 2mass .",
    "this is expected since the 2mass is a significantly shallower survey than the sdss survey .",
    "we define the `` 2mass sample '' as quasars detected in all of the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath2 bands , and the `` @xmath2 complete sample '' as quasars with @xmath23  mag . in  5 , we use quasar luminosity functions to model balqso fractions above selected absolute magnitude limits .",
    "since 2mass can not detect quasars less luminous than the above limits at high redshifts , we also present results for a `` narrower redshift '' sample , @xmath24 .",
    "our results are not significantly affected by the choice of sample selection .",
    "we found 884 quasars in the 2mass sample with 340 balqsos and 544 non - balqsos . in the @xmath2 complete sample , we found 245 , 99 , and 146 quasars for total , balqsos , and non - balqsos , respectively .",
    "the balqso fraction is @xmath1% in the @xmath2 complete sample and @xmath3% in the 2mass sample .",
    "we also tested @xmath21 and @xmath22 band complete samples , obtaining consistent results , @xmath25% and @xmath26% , respectively .",
    "these balqso fractions from 2mass bands are significantly higher than the 26% in the optical bands ( t06 ) . for example",
    ", the difference between the balqso fraction in optical and the @xmath2 complete sample is 4.4@xmath27 .",
    "this result is interesting , as we are analyzing the same parent balqso catalog used in the optical study .",
    "it indicates that there may be significant selection bias against balqsos in the optical photometric surveys . as a corollary the near infrared fraction obtained in this paper ( 35 - 40% ) represents the true fraction of balqsos .",
    "alternatively , balqsos may be intrinsically brighter in the near infrared bands or a combination of both effects is possible .",
    "we examine the fraction of balqsos as functions of apparent magnitude , absolute magnitude , and redshift to investigate the cause for the increase of the balqso fractions in the 2mass bands .    in top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fmag ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fabs ] , we plot the fraction of balqsos against the apparent and absolute magnitudes in the @xmath4 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath18 , @xmath30 and @xmath2 bands , respectively , in the redshift range of @xmath31 . in the bottom panels of fig .",

    "the k - corrections of the quasars are calculated assuming a power - law spectral index of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , vanden berk et al .",
    "we did not correct the intrinsic obscuration from dust extinction and absorption troughs for balqsos . in both fig .",

    "[ fig : fabs ] , the balqso fraction in the @xmath2 band is consistently higher than the optical fractions .",
    "in addition , the optical fractions increase with increasing wavelength .",
    "the two sets of plots are consistent , except for larger fluctuations in the @xmath2 band fraction for the full redshift sample , which do not affect our main result . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmag ] , we note that the optical fractions drop significantly when crossing certain magnitude limits . for example",
    ", the @xmath18 band fraction is roughly a constant of @xmath340.3 for @xmath35 mag , and steadily decreases as it crosses the @xmath36 mag limit .",
    "the @xmath4 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 band fractions behave similarly .",
    "their drop at different magnitudes from the @xmath18 band is expected given the quasar color and differing sensitivities of the optical bands .",
    "although the @xmath36 mag limit is also the spectroscopic limit for sdss quasars , this limit affects differently for bal and non - balqsos .",
    "we caution that there are more uncertainties below this limit , which make it difficult to model this effect .",
    "the higher balqso fractions in the 2mass bands , the increase of balqso fractions as wavelength increases , and the drop of balqso fractions when crossing certain apparent magnitudes in the optical bands suggest significant selection biases against balqsos .",
    "this is consistent with the spectral differences between balqsos and non - balqsos . by definition ,",
    "significant rest - frame ultra - violet continuum flux in balqsos is absorbed by the absorption troughs .",
    "in addition , there are also signatures of dust indicated by the difference between the continuum emission of the balqsos and non - balqsos ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; r03 ) .",
    "the composite spectra of balqsos and non - balqsos ( r03 ) differ significantly for rest - frame @xmath37 .",
    "for the full redshift range considered , @xmath0 , this spectral difference will affect all of the sdss filters .",
    "however , this spectral difference only affects 2mass bands marginally as results of dust extinction .",
    "the @xmath21 band is affected for @xmath38 balqsos , which only represent a small subset of 2mass detected quasars . in the narrower redshift range , @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath30 and redder bands are not affected by the absorption troughs for the hi - balqsos .",
    "although there will be absorption troughs for lo - balqsos in these red bands , the fraction of lo - balqsos is very small in this redshift range ( t06 ) .",
    "since the 2mass survey is shallower than the sdss survey , the 2mass sample is selecting brighter quasars .",
    "the difference of the balqso fractions between 2mass and sdss could be explained if the fractions of balqsos are higher for more luminous quasars . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : fabs ] shows that the optical fraction is roughly a constant in each band as functions of absolute magnitudes more luminous than @xmath40 , which spans about 5 magnitudes .",
    "we further test the idea of optical selection biases by examining the fraction of balqsos using the brightest 245 quasars in each band , such that they have similar statistics as in the complete @xmath2 sample .",
    "results are listed in table  [ tab : f ] .",
    "the fractions of balqsos steadily go up from the @xmath4 band to the @xmath2 band .",
    "tests with other sample sizes show consistent trends .",
    "[ fig : fz ] shows the fractions of balqsos as a function of redshift in the @xmath2 band for the 2mass detected quasar sample , and the @xmath18 band for the sdss sample .",
    "the 2mass fractions are consistently higher than the sdss @xmath18 band fractions .",
    "the 2mass fractions are less dependent on the redshift , while the optical fractions show significant variations .",
    "in particular , the optical fractions increase significantly in some redshift bins ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) close to the value expected from 2mass fractions .",
    "the non - uniformity of the optical balqso fractions as a function of redshift suggests significant selection biases against balqsos .",
    "the excess optical balqso fractions at @xmath41 are particularly interesting as they are consistent with the near infrared fractions .",
    "these excess fractions are possibly due to the color difference between balqsos and non - balqsos , which moves balqsos further way from the stellar locus",
    ". however , the 2mass bands do not show significant fraction increases at this redshift range , which could also be possibly benefited from the fact that the 2mass filters are substantially wider than the sdss filters .",
    "we also found that this redshift range is possibly related to the gap between sdss @xmath28 and @xmath29 filters , considering a c  iv  absorption line with a bal velocity of @xmath3420,000  .",
    "when the major bal feature falls between the filter gaps , there are less differences between balqsos and non - balqsos .",
    "thus , the photometric selection is expected to be less biased against selecting balqsos . as a result",
    ", the balqso fraction in the redshift range would be unbiased .",
    "this effect would also be important for other gaps between the sdss filters .",
    "we found a similar increase of balqso fraction at the redshift of @xmath42 corresponding to the gap between @xmath29 and @xmath18 filters .",
    "however , we did not find the feature for the gap between filters @xmath4 and @xmath28 , which would correspond to the starting edge of our studied redshift range .",
    "in addition , a blueshift of @xmath3420,000  seems large given the t06 balqso definition .",
    "detailed modeling of this effect using the sdss filter functions , quasar selection algorithm , and composite balqso spectrum is needed to further investigate the origin of the redshift - dependent balqso fractions in the optical bands .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : ik ] , we can already see color differences between balqsos and non - balqsos .",
    "the median @xmath43 color for balqsos and non - balqsos are 2.50 and 2.26 mag , respectively , in the 2mass sample .",
    "we plot the histograms of the @xmath5 color of balqsos and non - balqsos of the 2mass sample in fig .  [",
    "fig : color ] .",
    "balqsos are redder than non - balqsos . for example",
    ", the red tail of the balqso distribution is above that for non - balqsos .",
    "we performed a k - s test to the two distributions and obtained a probability of @xmath6 for the null assumption that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "the same test using only the @xmath2 complete sample yielded a probability of 0.0001 .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis in  3 that optical obscuration of balqsos can cause significant selection biases against selecting balqsos .",
    "the difference of the @xmath43 color difference is mainly caused by the @xmath18 mag distribution difference between the two populations . in the complete @xmath2 sample , the k - s probability for the @xmath18 mag distributions of balqsos and non - balqsos being the same is @xmath44 , while the k - s probability for @xmath2 mag distributions is 0.46 .",
    "this result is also consistent with previous studies of balqsos ( r03 ; t06 ) , where balqsos are found to be redder in the sdss bands . with only nine",
    "optically selected balqsos , hall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found no discrepancy between @xmath45 colors of balqsos and non - balqsos ; however , two of their radio selected balqsos are particularly red .",
    "the color differences between balqsos and non - balqsos in the 2mass bands are smaller and consistent with the expectation that there is an extra dust extinction in balqsos .",
    "the median @xmath46 and @xmath47 colors are 1.17 and 0.64 mag for non - balqsos and 1.26 and 0.67 mag for balqsos , with color differences of @xmath48 and @xmath49 mag .",
    "these differences are broadly consistent with the r03 dust extinction fit of @xmath50 between balqsos and non - balqsos , given the observed redshift distribution of the quasars .",
    "we have tested the k - s probability that the near infrared color distributions of balqsos and non - balqsos are drawn from the same sample , and found 0.0009 and 0.49 for the @xmath46 color distributions in the 2mass sample and @xmath2 complete sample , respectively , and probabilities of 0.36 and 0.78 for the @xmath47 color distributions .",
    "the k - s test results are consistent with small 2mass color differences between balqsos and non - balqsos .",
    "we performed simple simulations to model the fractions of balqsos in the optical and near infrared bands .",
    "we show that the increase of the balqso fractions with wavelength can be explained by the selection effects caused by the spectral differences between balqsos and non - balqsos including both absorption lines and dust extinction .",
    "our simulations are performed in the redshift range of @xmath24 .",
    "we assumed that the intrinsic ( extinction and absorption corrected ) luminosity functions of balqsos , @xmath51 , non - balqsos , @xmath52 , and total quasars , @xmath53 , share the same shape , but differ by normalization factors , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the intrinsic fraction of balqsos .",
    "the shape of the luminosity functions are represented by a double power - law luminosity function described by the richards et al .",
    "( 2005 ) luminosity function with a bright end slope of @xmath56 , a faint end slope of @xmath57 , and a break at @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 in the @xmath28 band . the faint end slope and the break of the luminosity function",
    "do not affect our results too much because the quasars in the sample are all significantly more luminous than the break of the luminosity function .",
    "the quasar luminosity functions in other bands are obtained by shifting the @xmath28 band luminosity function with the mean color of the quasars ( non - balqsos ) between the @xmath28 and the other bands .",
    "since there are extra intrinsic absorption troughs and dust extinction in balqsos , we modeled the obscured luminosity function of balqsos , @xmath62 , by shifting the intrinsic balqso luminosity function by @xmath63 to model the spectral difference between balqso and non - balqsos , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath63 is a function of wavelength .",
    "we obtained the values of @xmath63 from the composite spectra of balqsos and non - balqsos ( r03 ) . besides the absorption troughs",
    ", r03 found that an extra smc dust extinction for balqsos of @xmath65 with @xmath66 fits the continuum spectral differences .",
    "we therefore modeled the @xmath63 as two components , with one caused by such a dust extinction and the other by absorption troughs . since the @xmath4 band is not completely covered by the composite spectra of r03 , we can not fully model the absorption trough dimming and therefore exclude the @xmath4 band in our fitting process .",
    "the @xmath30 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath2 bands are also not completely covered ; however , since there are few absorption troughs in these band for quasars with @xmath24 , we modeled the @xmath63 from dust extinction only .",
    "we list the values of @xmath63 in table  [ tab : dm ] .",
    "as discussed earlier , we performed our simulations in the narrower redshift bin @xmath24 .",
    "this range avoids the larger optical balqso fractions at @xmath67 and @xmath42 .",
    "we examined the 2mass detected quasar absolute magnitudes as a function of redshift . in our redshift range ,",
    "2mass detects quasars more luminous than @xmath68 and @xmath69  mag for the @xmath2 complete sample and 2mass sample , respectively . to translate these limits to the other bands",
    ", we applied the non - balqso colors to the magnitude limits . for each band and limit , we calculated the balqso fractions and present them in table  1 .",
    "both limits agree qualitatively , and we hereafter use the larger 2mass sample . in particular , the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath18 , @xmath30 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath2 limits are -27.46 , -27.62 , -27.75 , -27.91 , -28.86 , -29.41 , and -30.10 mag , respectively .",
    "we started with quasar luminosity functions at the mean redshift , @xmath70 , of our narrow redshift sample and considered the fractions from the @xmath28 to @xmath2 bands .",
    "we fit these balqso fractions using our luminosity functions for balqsos and non - balqsos with one free parameter , @xmath55 , and obtained @xmath71 with @xmath72 for 6 degrees of freedom ( figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "we tested the robustness of our result by using the quasar luminosity functions at @xmath73 and @xmath74 in our fitting process , and obtained consistent fitting results .",
    "the fitting results are insensitive to the bright end slope of the luminosity function within the error of @xmath75 ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) .    alternatively , it is possible that balqsos are more near infrared luminous , which might explain the higher balqso fractions in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath2 bands .",
    "we tested this idea by fixing @xmath55 with the value from optical fractions and applying an extra brightening of @xmath76 for balqsos compared to the previous simulation .",
    "we found @xmath77  mag is needed to fit the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath2 band fractions .",
    "however , the fractions of the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath18 bands from this model are significantly lower than the observations . given our knowledge of the dust extinction and absorption troughs in balqsos , a wavelength dependent brightening of balqsos is needed from the @xmath28 to @xmath2 band to fit the observed fractions with a low intrinsic balqso fraction of 2530% .",
    "therefore , we consider this model as highly fine - tuned .",
    "this supported by the recently result that there is no significant spectral difference between balqsos and non - balqsos in mid - infrared within a moderate sized sample ( gallagher et al .",
    "we have presented enhanced fractions of balqsos in the 2mass detected quasars within the sdss dr3 sample compared to fractions derived in optical bands .",
    "the relatively large number of near infrared luminous balqsos used in our study compared with previous studies argues against discrepancies from small number statistics .",
    "the balqso fraction is @xmath1% in the @xmath2 complete sample and @xmath3% in the 2mass sample .",
    "the complete @xmath21 and @xmath22 samples also have similar fractions . after plotting the balqso fractions against apparent and absolute magnitudes in the 2mass and sdss bands , we found the 2mass fractions are consistently higher than the optical fractions .",
    "in addition , the balqso fractions steadily increase with wavelength from the sdss @xmath4 to the 2mass @xmath2 bands .",
    "we conclude that the optical photometric systems have significant selection biases against balqsos , and the balqso fraction in the near infrared more accurately reflects the true fraction of balqsos .",
    "this is also supported by the @xmath5 color difference between the populations of balqsos and non - balqsos .    after using a simple simulation incorporating the luminosity function of quasars and the amount of obscuration for balqsos , we are able to simultaneously fit the balqso fractions in the sdss and 2mass bands and obtain a true balqso fraction of @xmath7% , significantly higher than other balqso fractions reported in the literature .",
    "although a small sample was used , chartas ( 2000 ) found a balqso fraction of 35% in a gravitationally - lensed quasar sample , close to our near infrared balqso fraction .",
    "this sample actually avoids some of the selection biases in the optical bands .",
    "the previous lens sample was selected serendipitously from many surveys , and all the gravitational lenses are identified spectroscopically .",
    "in addition , the lensing has boosted the s / n of the quasars so that they are less biased against discounting the balqsos .",
    "selection biases against balqsos has been proposed by previous studies , where a continuum anisotropy causes the selection biases ( e.g. , goodrich 1997 ; krolik & voit 1998 ) . in our simulations",
    "we show that the selection biases can be explained with obscuration from dust extinction and absorption troughs in balqsos .",
    "essentially , an anisotropy is also produced after the optical obscuration which , combined with the steep quasar luminosity function , will produce lower balqso fractions in those bands more sensitive to obscuration .",
    "an intrinsic continuum anisotropy is also possible ; however , it needs to be fine tuned as a function of wavelength that behaves similarly to the effect of dust extinction , especially in the longer wavelength bands .",
    "different continuum emission between balqso and non - balqsos is also expected if the balqsos are either at special evolution stages of quasar evolution , or the near infrared emission of balqsos are enhanced by the reprocessed emission from the absorption lines .",
    "this fact is also connected to the idea that balqsos are in the transition stage between infrared luminous galaxies and quasar phases ( lpari et al .",
    "to test whether the continuum emission in the balqsos and non - balqsos are similar , we need to compare the absorption corrected spectra for balqsos with non - balqsos , which involves significant complexity in the analysis of the optical spectra . as the observed near infrared band is little affected by the bal features , it would be ideal to make the comparison there .",
    "however , a near infrared spectroscopic survey is needed to better measure the power - law slope and k - correction of the quasars before we draw a solid conclusion .",
    "our sample size is limited by the 2mass survey limits .",
    "future infrared surveys ( e.g. , ukidss with survey limits of @xmath78  mag ) will significantly increase the sample size , and enable us to extend this study of balqso fractions to less luminous quasars .",
    "our analysis indicates that the near infrared balqso fraction more accurately reflects the true fraction of balqsos .",
    "this is important when using the fraction of balqsos to constrain quasar geometric and evolutionary models . in this paper",
    ", we found a balqso fraction of @xmath79% in the 2mass bands under the t06 criterion .",
    "this indicates a correction of factor @xmath80 is needed for the optical fractions , consistent with the modeling of hewett & foltz ( 2003 ) .",
    "we note that the fraction of balqsos is also dependent on the spectral definition of balqsos .",
    "t06 also analyzed the fraction of balqsos under the original definition of weymann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and found a balqso fraction of 10% , different from the 26% under the t06 criterion .",
    "we analyzed the fraction of balqsos in 2mass under the weymann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) definition and obtained fractions of @xmath81% and @xmath82% in the @xmath2 complete and 2mass sample using the balnicity indices provided by t06 .",
    "we obtained a correction factor of @xmath83 for the optical fraction under the weymann et al .  definition .",
    "this result is not surprising since the weymann et al .",
    "definition for balqsos is more strict , and we expect more severe optical obscuration and a larger correction factor for the optical fraction . this fraction is also very similar to @xmath84% obtained by modeling directly in the optical bands and using the weymann et al .  definition ( hewett & foltz 2003 ) .",
    "since the radio bands are also not affected by dust extinction and absorption troughs , we expect the radio fraction of balqsos should also have a large fraction of @xmath79% under the t06 definition .",
    "however , the situation in this case is more complex . for example",
    ", the fractions of balqsos are found to be dependent on the radio flux ( hewett & foltz 2003 ) , while our balqso fractions in the near infrared bands are nearly constant , independent of the flux .",
    "the complexity may be due to different mechanisms responsible for the radio and uv / optical ( observed optical / near infrared ) emission of quasars ; however , further investigation is needed .",
    "our near infrared balqso fractions are roughly constants across the large redshift range of @xmath31 , which suggests that the covering fraction of the bal wind does not evolve significantly in the geometric models .",
    "the 40% balqso fraction implies a large wind half opening angle of @xmath85 , suggesting that the bal wind is raised significantly above the accretion disk as compared to @xmath86 for a @xmath87% fraction .",
    "this might impose significant challenges to theoretical models on wind dynamics ( see krolik & voit 1998 for this and other implications ) .",
    "the results of the paper will also be useful in constraining evolutionary models for balqsos by combining the constraints from the number density , luminosity function , and duty cycle of quasars .",
    "we acknowledge discussion at the agn lunch in the osu astronomy department , especially karen leighly , chris kochanek , david weinberg , and paul martini .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",
