    "nearly all previous three - dimensional convection calculations have been subject to a variety of limitations .",
    "many simulations have been for small aspect ratios where the lateral boundaries dominate the dynamics , and as a result , complicate the analysis . when larger aspect ratios are considered , it is often with the assumption of periodic boundaries , which is convenient numerically yet does not correspond to any laboratory experiment . as a result of algorithmic inefficiencies , or the lack of computer resources ,",
    "simulations have frequently not been carried out for long times .",
    "this presents the difficulty in determining whether the observed behavior represents the asymptotic non - transient state , which is usually the state that is most easily understood theoretically .",
    "fortunately , advances in parallel computers , numerical algorithms and data storage are such that direct numerical simulations of the full three - dimensional time dependent equations are possible for experimentally realistic situations .",
    "we have performed simulations with experimentally correct boundary conditions , in geometries of varying shapes and aspect ratios over long enough times so as to allow a detailed quantitative comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "alan newell has made numerous important contributions to the discussion of pattern formation in non - equilibrium systems . in this paper ,",
    "presented in this special issue in his honor , we give a survey of our recent results that touch on many of the issues he has raised , and in turn make use of some of the tools that he has helped develop to understand our simulations .",
    "we have performed full numerical simulations of the fluid and heat equations using a parallel spectral element algorithm ( described in detail elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity @xmath0 , temperature @xmath1 , and pressure @xmath2 , evolve according to the boussinesq equations , @xmath3 where @xmath4 indicates time differentiation , @xmath5 is a unit vector in the vertical direction opposite of gravity , @xmath6 is the rayleigh number , and @xmath7 is the prandtl number .",
    "the equations are nondimensionalized in the standard manner using the layer height @xmath8 , the vertical diffusion time for heat @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the thermal diffusivity , and the temperature difference across the layer @xmath11 , as the length , time , and temperature scales , respectively .",
    "we have investigated a wide range of geometries including cylindrical and rectangular domains , which are the most common experimentally , in addition to elliptical and annular domains .",
    "rotation about the vertical axis of the convection layer for any of these situations is also possible but will not be presented here .",
    "all bounding surfaces are no - slip , @xmath12 , and the lower and upper surfaces and are held at constant temperature , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    a variety of sidewall boundary conditions are shown in fig .  [ fig : sidewalls ] .",
    "common thermal boundary conditions on the lateral sidewalls are insulating , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a unit vector normal to the boundary at a given point , and conducting , @xmath17 .",
    "in the future we will have the flexibility of imposing a more experimentally accurate thermal boundary condition by coupling the fluid to a lateral wall of finite thickness and known finite thermal conductivity that is bounded on the outside by a vacuum .        in experiment , however , small sidewall thermal forcing can have a significant effect upon the resulting patterns and , as a result , finned boundaries have been employed  @xcite .",
    "these are formed by inserting a very thin piece of paper or cardboard between the top and bottom plates near the sidewalls .",
    "this suppresses convection over the finned region ( @xmath18 and the layer height has effectively been reduced ) whereas in the bulk of the domain , i.e. the un - finned region , supercritical conditions prevail .",
    "this is accomplished numerically by extending a no - slip surface into the domain from the lateral sidewall . in all of our simulations",
    "we have chosen the vertical position of the fin to be @xmath19 but this is not necessary .",
    "the result is that the supercritical portion of the convection layer is bounded by a subcritical region of the same fluid and hence with the same material properties .",
    "an additional effect is that the mean flow may extend into the finned region which presents an interesting scenario for exploring the effect of mean flows upon pattern dynamics  that has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically by pocheau and daviaud   and is discussed further below .",
    "the sidewalls can also have an orienting effect and ramped boundaries have been used as a  soft boundary \"  @xcite in an effort to minimize this . by gradually decreasing the plate separation as the lateral sidewall is approached the convection layer eventually becomes critical and then increasingly subcritical . using the spectral element algorithm we are able to investigate arbitrary ramp shapes : we have chosen to investigate the precise radial ramp utilized in recent experiments   on a cylindrical convection layer . again",
    "the mean flow is able to extend into the subcritical region .",
    "perhaps the most common method employed experimentally to reduce the influence of sidewalls is to use a large aspect ratio @xmath20 , where @xmath21 in a cylindrical domain where @xmath22 is the radius and @xmath23 in a square domain where @xmath24 is the length of side .",

    "these , and other , interesting large aspect ratio problems can now be addressed through the use of numerical simulation .",

    "<S> rayleigh - bnard convection is studied and quantitative comparisons are made , where possible , between theory and experiment by performing numerical simulations of the boussinesq equations for a variety of experimentally realistic situations . </S>",
    "<S> rectangular and cylindrical geometries of varying aspect ratios for experimental boundary conditions , including fins and spatial ramps in plate separation , are examined with particular attention paid to the role of the mean flow . </S>",
    "<S> a small cylindrical convection layer bounded laterally either by a rigid wall , fin , or a ramp is investigated and our results suggest that the mean flow plays an important role in the observed wavenumber . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results are developed quantifying the mean flow sources , generated by amplitude gradients , and its effect on the pattern wavenumber for a large - aspect - ratio cylinder with a ramped boundary . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are found to agree well with these analytical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we gain further insight into the role of mean flow in pattern dynamics by employing a novel method of quenching the mean flow numerically . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of a spiral defect chaos state where the mean flow is suddenly quenched is found to remove the time dependence , increase the wavenumber and make the pattern more angular in nature . </S>"
