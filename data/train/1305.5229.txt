    "the _ chromatic number of the plane _ , denoted by @xmath0 , is the least integer @xmath1 such that the points of the plane can be colored in @xmath1 colors such that no two points exactly unit distance apart are the same color .",
    "well - known elementary arguments show that @xmath2 , but no improvement on these bounds appears to be forthcoming .",
    "the difficulty of improving these bounds has led several authors to consider various modifications to the problem .",
    "for instance , one might restrict the type of coloring . in @xcite",
    ", falconer shows that if the color classes must be measurable , then at least five colors are required .",
    "( see @xcite , ch .",
    "9 , for a nice exposition . ) in @xcite , townsend announces the result that every  map - coloring \" of the plane requires at least six colors , and provides a proof in @xcite . in a basically identical result couched in different language ,",
    "coulson @xcite considers colorings in which the color classes are composed of  tiles \" , and shows that six colors are required .",
    "another approach is to consider colorings of proper subsets of the plane . in @xcite ,",
    "axenovich et al . consider but do not determine the chromatic number of @xmath3 .",
    "they also determine the chromatic number of infinite strips of different widths , and of the union of two parallel lines . in @xcite , kruskal considers bounded simply connected subsets of the plane .",
    "in particular , he shows that for a closed disk of radius @xmath4 ,    * the disk is 2-colorable if and only if @xmath5 ; * the disk is 3-colorable if and only if @xmath6 ; * the disk is 4-colorable if @xmath7 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the annulus with inner radius @xmath8 and outer radius @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and prove some surprising results in the case that the colorings are required to be  nice . \"",
    "let @xmath10 , and let @xmath11 .",
    "we recall two lemmas from kruskal s paper @xcite .    [ rod ] a _ rod _ is a line segment of unit length . if a region @xmath12 is 2-colored , and we slide a rod continuously so that its endpoints stay within the interior of @xmath12 , then the set of points passed over by a given endpoint is monochromatic .",
    "[ trirod ] a _ tri - rod _ is an equilateral triangle of unit side length .",
    "if a region @xmath12 is 3-colored , and we slide a tri - rod continuously so that its vertices stay within the interior of @xmath12 , then the set of points passed over by a given vertex is monochromatic .    if @xmath13 , then a rod can be placed with endpoints interior to @xmath14 . by rotating the rod by @xmath15 about its center , we see that if @xmath14 were 2-colored , then by lemma [ rod ] the two endpoints would have to be colored the same color .",
    "but the endpoints are unit distance apart , so @xmath14 is not 2-colorable",
    ". see figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "an alternate method of proof is to embed an odd cycle .",
    "see figure [ fig : fodd ] .            if @xmath16 , then @xmath14 is 3-colorable .",
    "figure [ fig : f2 ] shows a proper 3-coloring of @xmath14 with @xmath17 ( so that the outer radius of @xmath14 is @xmath18 ) .",
    "each boundary between sectors is colored the same color as the sector clockwise from it .    ]    if @xmath19 , then the outer radius of @xmath14 is greater than @xmath18 , so a tri - rod can be placed such that its endpoints lie in the interior of @xmath14 .",
    "thus by rotating @xmath20 and applying lemma [ trirod ] , we see that @xmath14 is not 3-colorable .",
    "see figure [ fig : f3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : f4 ] shows a proper 4-coloring of @xmath14 for @xmath21 ( so that the outer radius of @xmath14 is @xmath22 ) .",
    "again , the boundaries between sectors are colored the same color as the adjacent sector in the clockwise direction .    ]",
    "kruskal leaves open the question of whether a closed disk of radius greater than @xmath22 can be properly 4-colored .",
    "one might think that an annulus with outer radius @xmath23 could be properly 4-colored ",
    "after all , it has a hole in the middle  but the present authors have been unable to construct such a coloring .",
    "the nature of the difficulty will be illuminated in the next section .",
    "let @xmath10 .",
    "a coloring of @xmath14 is called _ radial _ if there exists a sequence of radii @xmath24 such that the sector strictly between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is colored with a single color .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the least number of colors needed to give a proper coloring of @xmath14 using radial colorings only .",
    "the radial colorings are the  nice \" colorings mentioned at the end of section [ intro ] .",
    "we emphasize that the boundaries between sectors can be colored arbitrarily , while the sectors between radial boundaries must be monochromatic .",
    "see figure [ fig : fsector ] .",
    "a _ unit chord _ in @xmath14 is a chord of unit length .",
    "a _ unit sector _ is a sector of minimal size that contains a unit chord .",
    "see figure [ fig : fchord ] .",
    "the following lemma will be powerful enough to allow us to determine @xmath27 for all @xmath10 .",
    "[ mainlem ] let @xmath10 and let @xmath14 be given a proper radial coloring .",
    "then the interior of any color class is included in some unit sector .",
    "call the intersection of a radial ray with @xmath14 a _ radial segment_. see figure [ fig : fradseg ] .        by way of contradiction",
    ", suppose there exist two radial segments of the same color ( red , say ) such that the chord joining their farthest - apart points has length greater than 1 ( figure [ fig : fgr1 ] ) .",
    "call one of the segments @xmath28 ( figure [ fig : lemmafig ] ) , and call the point at which it intersects the outer circle @xmath29 .",
    "call the other segment @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be the two points that are a unit chord away from @xmath29 ( figure [ fig : aandb ] ) .    ]    , @xmath32 , and @xmath29 ]    let @xmath34 be antipodal to @xmath29 , and draw a segment from @xmath31 to @xmath34 ( figure [ fig : atopprime ] ) .     to @xmath34 ]    now take the unit - length rod that goes from @xmath29 to @xmath31 , and slide it continuously so that one endpoint stays on @xmath28 and the other stays on @xmath36 ( figure [ fig : segslide ] ) .    ]",
    "thus every radial segment between @xmath31 and @xmath34 has a point on it that is unit distance from some point of @xmath28 .",
    "( similarly for those between @xmath34 and @xmath32 . ) but this is a contradiction , since some point on @xmath30 must be on @xmath36 or @xmath37",
    ".    let @xmath10 .",

    "that @xmath40 follows immediately from the previous lemma .",

    "it may be interesting to consider other connected but not simply connected regions of the plane .",
    "for instance , consider the well - known periodic hexagonal coloring of the plane in 7 colors .",
    "take one color class , enlarge it slightly and delete it , leaving a  holey plane . \"",
    "certainly , this holey plane can be colored in 6 colors .",
    "can it be colored in 5 ?",
    "townsend s result on colorings using tiles would seem not to apply .    bounded and not simply connected subsets may also be interesting to consider , although it would seem that their analysis promises little additional insight into the larger problem of understanding plane colorings and determining the chromatic number of the plane .",
    "after all , the authors were not able to find colorings of @xmath14 that improve kruskal s corresponding bounds for circular regions ; the  donut hole \" did not seem to be useful for arbitrary colorings .    a more promising approach might be to try to prove ( or find a counterexample for ) a moser - spindle version of kruskal s tri - rod lemma . if @xmath45 , then a spindle can be embedded into the interior of @xmath14 ( see figure [ fig : moserfig ] ) . if a tri - rod can be embedded , then @xmath14 is not 3-colorable .",
