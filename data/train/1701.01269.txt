    "following totem s impressive results @xcite on the low-@xmath2 measurements of the @xmath3 differential cross section at @xmath4 tev and low @xmath5 , and anticipating their new measurements at @xmath6 tev announced recently @xcite we find it appropriate to remind of the physics behind the observed departure from the exponential behaviour of the forward diffraction cone .",
    "for the first time this phenomenon , a deflection from the exponential behaviour of the forward cone in proton - proton scattering around @xmath7 gev@xmath1 was observed in 1972 at the the cern isr @xcite , detected at several energies .",
    "experimentalists @xcite quantify the departure from the linear exponential by replacing @xmath8 with coefficients @xmath9 fitted to the data .",
    "this effect can be well fitted @xcite also by a relevant form factor ( residue function ) in the regge - pole scattering amplitude . for a complete and up - to - date review see @xcite .",
    "soon after the isr measurements , the phenomenon was interpreted @xcite as manifestation of @xmath2 channel unitarity , producing a two - pion loop , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , and resulting in a relevant threshold singularity in the pomeron trajectory .",
    "this effect , for bravity called the `` break '' , was confirmed by recent measurements by the totem collaboration at the cern lhc , first at @xmath4 tev @xcite and subsequently at @xmath6 tev @xcite .",
    "-channel exchange containing a branch point at @xmath10 . ]    the new lhc data from totem at @xmath4 tev confirm the conclusions made @xcite about the nature of the break and call for a more detailed analysis of the phenomenon .",
    "the new data triggered further theoretical work in this direction @xcite , but many issues still remain open . although the curvature , both at the isr and the lhc is concave , convex can not be excluded in other reactions and/or new energies . while the departure from a linear exponential was studied in details both at the isr and lhc energies ,",
    "an extra(inter)polation between the two is necessary to clarify the uniqueness of the phenomenon .",
    "this is a challenge for the theory , and it can be done within regge - pole models .",
    "below we do so by using a very simple one , with two regge exchanges , a pomeron and a secondary effective reggeon . to test its viability , we first fit its parameters to the proton - proton total section data ( sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the basic premise behind our approach is the introduction of a two - pion loop contribution in the @xmath2 channel through regge trajectories , that are non - linear complex functions . as shown by barut and zwanziger @xcite",
    ", @xmath2 channel unitarity constrains the regge trajectories near the @xmath2 channel threshold , @xmath11 by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lightest threshold , @xmath14 in the case of the vacuum quantum numbers ( pomeron or @xmath15 meson ) . since @xmath16 is small , a square - root threshold is a reasonable approximation to the above constrain .",
    "higher threshold , inevitable in the trajectory , may be approximated by their power expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ by a linear term , as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : trajectory ] ) .",
    "this point is closely related also to the choice of the relevant interval in @xmath2 under study .",
    "note that the threshold singularity is at positive @xmath10 , while the `` break '' is observed at negative @xmath2 , `` symmetric '' to @xmath14 .",
    "this reflection is a property of analytic functions .",
    "the concave departure from the linear exponential , observed in the interval @xmath17 gev@xmath1 can be fitted by a single square - root threshold in the trajectory , but it would not reproduce the subsequent ( @xmath18 gev@xmath1 ) linearity of the exponential cone , persistent up to the dip ( at @xmath19 gev@xmath1 at the isr or @xmath20 gev@xmath1 at the lhc ) . note also that we treat only the strong ( nuclear ) amplitude , separated from coulombic forces . thus , the `` break '' ( in fact a smooth deflection of the linear exponential ) of the cone , has a relatively narrow location around @xmath21 gev@xmath22 both at the isr and the lhc energies , whereupon it recovers its exponential shape , followed by the dip , whose position is strongly energy - dependent .    in the present paper we study the `` break '' within a simple regge - pole model , assuming the universality of this phenomenon in high - energy hadron scattering . on fitting the model to the data",
    ", we proceed in two ways : 1 ) trying to minimize the number of free parameters , we adopt standard values for the trajectories , _",
    "e.g. _ from ref .",
    "@xcite ; 2 ) on the other hand , in view of the oversimplified nature of our `` effective '' regge - pole model , we optionally let these parameters free , fitting them to the data .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce a simple regge - pole model , normalizing its energy dependence to @xmath3 total cross section data . in [ sec : isr ] we revise the 1972 isr data and their fits to a regge - pole model with a @xmath2 channel threshold imposed by unitarity . in sec .",

    "[ extrapolate ] , in which , by regge - extrapolating the cross section from the isr energy region to that of the isr , we map the `` break '' fitted at the isr to that seen at the lhc . some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "for our purposes we use a simple regge pole model with a supercritical pomeron @xcite and an effective reggeon contributions , denoted by @xmath23 , close ( but not similar ) to the @xmath15 reggeon , @xmath24 where @xmath25 with the trajectories @xmath26 we use the norm : @xmath27 the model contains 12 free parameters ( @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( dimensionless ) , @xmath31 ( dimensionless ) , @xmath32 ( gev@xmath33 ) , @xmath34 ( gev@xmath35 ) , @xmath36 ( gev@xmath1 ) , @xmath37 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath38 ( dimensionless ) , @xmath39 ( dimensionless ) , @xmath40 ( gev@xmath33 ) , @xmath41 ( gev@xmath35 ) , @xmath42 ( gev@xmath1 ) ) , most of which are known a priori , needing only fine - tuning .",
    "we shall optionally use known values of the parameters and/or let them free .    anticipating detailed fits to the low @xmath5 data , we start with a simple fit to the data on proton - proton total cross section starting from 2.3 gev , with fixed intercepts of the pomeron @xmath43 and of the effective reggeon @xmath44 @xcite . from this fit",
    "we find the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath37 , to be fine - tuned in what follows .",

    "is a highly non - trivial task .",
    "we have done it within the simplest regge pole model , with two trajectories : a leading one , the pomeron and a sub - leading effective reggeon .",

    "once the pomeron is universal , the effect should be present also in @xmath71 .",
    "non - observation of any convex or concave curvature in the diffraction cone at the tevatron may be attributed to poor statistics of the relevant data ( lacking roman pots ) , preventing the observation of such a tiny effect .",
    "to conclude , we expect more precise data in the low @xmath5 region on elastic scattering and diffraction dissociation as well as further fits with improved phenomenological parametrizations .",
    "theoretical calculations of the diagram fig.[fig : diagram ] may shed more light on the nature of the phenomenon .",
    "needless to say , further attempts in this direction will be based on improved models for the scattering amplitude , with more details on individual regge trajectories , including the odderon .",
