    "the discovery of the higgs boson and the measurement of its interactions with massive quarks and vector bosons represent a central goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . for a light higgs boson , @xmath4 ,",
    "associated @xmath1 production provides the opportunity to observe the higgs boson in the @xmath2 decay channel and to measure the top - quark yukawa coupling .",
    "however , the extraction of the @xmath3 signal from its large qcd backgrounds , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , represents a serious challenge .",
    "the selection strategies elaborated by atlas and cms  @xcite anticipate a statistical significance around @xmath7 and a signal - to - background ratio as low as 1/10 .",
    "this calls for better than 10% precision in the background description , a very demanding requirement both from the experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "very recently , a novel selection strategy based on highly boosted higgs bosons has opened new and very promising perspectives  @xcite .",
    "this approach might increase the signal - to - background ratio beyond @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , three @xmath9-taggings would be sufficient to strongly suppress the @xmath10 contamination so that the background would be completely dominated by @xmath11 production .",
    "the calculation of the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the irreducible @xmath0 background , first presented in   and subsequently confirmed in  , constitutes another important step towards the observability of @xmath3 at the lhc .",
    "these nlo predictions are mandatory in order to reduce the huge scale uncertainty of the lowest - order ( lo ) @xmath0 cross section , which can vary up to a factor four if the qcd scales are identified with different kinematic parameters  @xcite . motivated by results for the signal process @xmath12 @xcite , where a moderate @xmath13 factor ( @xmath14 ) had been found @xcite , experimental groups adopted the scale @xmath15 for the lo simulation of the @xmath0 background  @xcite .",
    "however , at this scale the nlo corrections to @xmath5 turn out to be large @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the nlo corrections to @xmath5 constitutes also an important technical benchmark .",
    "the description of many - particle processes at nlo plays a central role for the lhc physics programme , and the technical challenges raised by these calculations have triggered an impressive amount of conceptual and technical developments . within the last year , this progress has lead to the first nlo results for six - particle processes at the lhc , namely for  @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , the leading-  @xcite and the full - colour contributions  @xcite to @xmath18 , for @xmath19 @xcite and for the @xmath20 contribution to @xmath21  @xcite .    to compute the virtual corrections to @xmath0 production",
    "we employ explicit feynman - diagrammatic representations of the one - loop amplitudes and numerical reduction of tensor integrals  @xcite .",
    "the factorisation of colour matrices , the algebraic reduction of helicity structures , and the systematic recycling of a multitude of common subexpressions  both inside individual diagrams and in tensor integrals of different diagrams that share common sub - topologies  strongly mitigate the factorial complexity that is inherent in feynman diagrams and lead to a remarkably high cpu efficiency .",
    "our results have been confirmed with the helac-1loop implementation of the opp method  @xcite within the statistical monte carlo error of 0.2%  @xcite .",
    "in lo , the hadronic production of @xmath0 proceeds via the partonic processes @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are described by 7 and 36 tree diagrams , respectively .",
    "the corresponding virtual nlo qcd corrections involve 188 and 1003 one - loop diagrams .",
    "the real emission contributions comprise the crossing - symmetric channels @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which involve 64 tree diagrams each , and the channel @xmath27 with 341 diagrams .",
    "each of these contributions has been worked out twice and independently , resulting in two completely independent computer codes .",
    "the virtual corrections are calculated in the feynman - diagrammatic approach .",
    "the diagrams are generated with two independent versions of feynarts @xcite and algebraically simplified with two in - house mathematica programs that generate fortran77 code in a fully automatised way .",
    "one of the two programs relies on formcalc  5.2  @xcite for preliminary algebraic manipulations .",
    "the virtual corrections are obtained from the interference of the one - loop and lo matrix elements -1 on a diagram - by - diagram basis .",
    "owing to colour factorisation for individual ( sub)diagrams colour sums can be performed very efficiently . the colour - summed result is given by a combination of previously computed colour  born interference terms .",
    "this requires _ a single evaluation _ of the non - trivial colour - stripped amplitude of each ( sub)diagram .",
    "helicity structures are handled in a similar way .",
    "the helicity - dependent parts of all diagrams are reduced to a common basis of so - called standard matrix elements ( smes ) , and helicity sums are performed once and for all at the level of the smes  born interference .",
    "the diagram - independent treatment of the helicity - dependent parts of loop graphs is made possible by the covariant decomposition of tensor integrals .",
    "the one - loop amplitudes are expressed as linear combinations of tensor - integral coefficients .",
    "the latter are evaluated by two independent _ numerical _ fortran libraries that recursively reduce them to master integrals using the methods of . avoiding an explicit reduction of analytic expressions to master integrals",
    ", this numerical approach prevents prohibitively large expressions and permits to adapt the reduction strategy to the specific numerical problems that appear in different phase - space regions .",
    "an automatic cache system is implemented that strongly boosts the reduction by recycling a multitude of tensor integrals among feynman diagrams with common sub - topologies .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences are regularized dimensionally throughout , but infrared ( ir ) divergences are treated in different variants , which comprise pure dimensional regularization with strictly massless light quarks and a hybrid scheme with small quark masses .",
    "the corresponding scalar integrals are evaluated using the methods and results of , and different regularization schemes are translated into each other as described in .",
    "the treatment of rational parts is greatly simplified by the fact that rational terms resulting from @xmath28 and @xmath29 poles of ir kind vanish in truncated one - loop amplitudes @xcite .",
    "rational terms arising from uv poles of tensor integrals with @xmath30-dependent coefficients are automatically extracted by means of a catalogue of residues .",
    "the reduction to smes is performed in such a way that no spurious poles are generated that might cause numerical instabilities .",
    "it starts with process - independent @xmath30-dimensional relations such as momentum conservation , dirac algebra , transversality , and gauge - fixing conditions for the gluon - polarisation vectors .",
    "once rational terms are extracted , we further reduce smes with two alternative algorithms in four dimensions . for the gluon induced process ,",
    "the first algorithm splits each fermion chain into two contributions , @xmath31 via insertion of chiral projectors @xmath32 .",
    "this permits to employ various relations of type @xmath33 , which connect dirac matrices of different fermion chains  @xcite , to reduce the full amplitude to 502 smes  @xcite .",
    "besides this procedure , which depends on process - specific aspects , we implemented a simple process - independent reduction based on a single four - dimensional identity of type @xmath34 , which eliminates spinor chains with more than three dirac matrices without introducing @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "this leads to 970 smes . in spite of the factor - two difference in the number of smes , the numerical codes based on the two different reductions have the same  and remarkably high  cpu speed : about @xmath36ms per phase - space point .",
    "thus , the obtained cpu performance , at least for this process , does not depend on process - dependent optimisations .    to handle singularities in the real corrections we employed the dipole subtraction method  @xcite , in particular the maddipole implementation @xcite in one of our calculations .",
    "the @xmath37 matrix elements were generated with madgraph  @xcite and checked against analytic calculations with the weyl ",
    "van der waerden spinor formalism and in - house code based on off - shell recursions .",
    "more details are given in  .",
    "we study the process @xmath38 at @xmath39 with @xmath40 and massless @xmath41  quarks .",
    "massless final - state partons with rapidity  azimuthal - angle separation @xmath42 are recombined into jets using a , and we require two b jets with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we use the cteq6 set of pdfs but neglect the suppressed contributions from b  quarks in the initial state .",
    "more details are given in     in all recent atlas studies of @xmath3 @xcite the signal and its @xmath0 background were simulated by setting the renormalisation and factorisation scales equal to half the threshold energy , @xmath45 . in",
    "we found that for this scale choice the nlo corrections to @xmath5 are close to a factor of two .",
    "this enhancement is due to the fact that @xmath5 is a multi - scale process involving various scales well below @xmath46 .",
    "the inspection of differential distributions reveals that the cross section is saturated by b quarks with @xmath47 .",
    "therefore we introduced in the dynamical scale [ centralscale]^2_0= , which improves the perturbative convergence and minimises nlo effects in the shape of distributions .    using the scale",
    ", we discussed in the kinematic region @xmath48 and found that for all distributions considered the nlo corrections are at the level of 2030% and have relatively little impact on the shape of distributions . on the other hand we the corrections still induce significant distortions of the kinematic distributions in the regime of a highly boosted higgs boson , which offers better perspectives to observe the @xmath49 signal . here",
    "we provide some distributions in this scenario with @xmath50 .",
    "in we show the scale dependence of the lo and nlo integrated cross sections .",
    "renormalisation ( @xmath51 ) and factorisation ( @xmath52 ) scales are varied around the central value , _ =",
    "_ _ 0,_=__0 . in a uniform ( @xmath53 ) and antipodal ( @xmath54 ) way in the range @xmath55 . at the central scale",
    "we obtain @xmath56 and @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "the shape of the scale - dependence curves indicates good convergence and stability of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the shifts induced by factor - two variations of the qcd scales amount to 79% in lo and 22% in nlo .    for distributions we provide lo and nlo predictions with uncertainty bands for factor - two uniform scale variations , which have a larger impact as antipodal variations .",
    "more precisely , all observables are evaluated at three different scales : @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60 invariant - mass distribution is displayed in .",
    "the nlo corrections induce an appreciable shape distortion of about 20% , in particular near the physically interesting region of @xmath61 .",
    "such an effect tends to mimic a higgs signal and should be carefully taken into account in the @xmath3 analysis .    for other distributions",
    "the shape distortion is not as sizeable . as examples we show the distribution in the azimuthal angle @xmath62 that represents the azimuthal orientation of the b jets with respect to the beam direction in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath60 momentum in    and the dependence of the cross section with respect to a cut on the @xmath0 invariant mass in .",
    "the observation of the @xmath63 signal at the lhc requires a very precise description of the @xmath64 irreducible background .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections reveal that the scale choice adopted in previous lo simulations of @xmath65 does not account for the multi - scale character of this process and underestimates its cross section by a factor of two .",
    "a suitably chosen dynamical scale significantly reduces both the @xmath13 factor and the residual nlo scale uncertainty . for standard cuts nlo",
    "effects feature a relatively small kinematic dependence , but in the regime of highly boosted higgs bosons significant distortions are still present in the shape of some distributions .",
