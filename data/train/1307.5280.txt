    "black hole x - ray transients , which are systems consisting of a stellar black hole primary accreting matter from its companion star , display fruitful and distinctive spectral and timing features during their outbursts ( see @xcite for reviews ) . based on their x - ray properties",
    ", three states were discovered .",
    "the soft state is relatively bright , the spectrum is thermal , which can be modeled as multi - temperature blackbody radiation in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the hard x - ray flux is relatively weak in this state .",
    "the hard state , on the other hand , is usually fainter .",
    "the thermal component is very weak ( if not absent ) , whereas the hard non - thermal x - ray radiation dominates .",
    "the intermediate state is a combination of the above two states @xcite .",
    "( near-)simultaneous joint radio and x - ray observations show that the sources are also bright in radio band during their hard states ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radio emission is usually interpreted as the radiative signature of a jet , which has been resolved in a few cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "high resolution radio observations of several sources reveal properties similar to quasars , i.e. two - sided jet - like structures and/or superluminal motions of the jet components , and earn them the name microquasars @xcite .",
    "extensive observations have been made in recent years , which result in an accumulation of a huge amount of multi - band ( from radio to @xmath0 ) observational data , and lead to a better understanding of these systems .",
    "the observations on the hard state of microquasars support the basic theoretical picture @xcite that , these systems are composed of relativistic expanding ejections ( jets ) , plus a standard thin disc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ssd hereafter ) which is truncated at certain radius and changes into a hot accretion flow @xcite . under this general picture ,",
    "the radiation at a given waveband may be dominated by the contribution from a specified component ( e.g. jet or disc ) , or even a specified location of one component .",
    "for example , similar to the emission of the radio cores in active galactic nuclei , the flat or slightly inverted radio ( up to infrared ) spectrum can be naturally interpreted as self - absorbed synchrotron radiation from relativistic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another example comes from the @xmath1-ray radiation .",
    "although under certain extreme conditions hot accretion flow can also produce strong @xmath1-ray radiation through @xmath2 production from @xmath3 collisions @xcite , the @xmath1-ray radiation in microquasars is generally interpreted as radiation from energetic particles in relativistic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the origin of the x - ray radiation , on the other hand , is still actively debated ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "one possibility is that the x - ray may have its origin from jets ( namely the jet model ) , either as synchrotron ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or inverse compton of the synchrotron ( synchrotron self - comptonization ) and/or the blackbody ( external comptonization ) radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that the x - ray radiation is the comptonization of synchrotron radiation within the hot accretion flow itself @xcite .",
    "we note that the latter , with the name jet-(hot ) accretion scenario , can also naturally explain the complicated timing features of the microquasar xte j1118 + 480 @xcite , and makes itself more attractive compared to the jet model . in the jet - accretion model",
    ", the hot accretion flow can be the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf hereafter , @xcite ) at lower luminosities or the luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf hereafter , @xcite ) at brighter luminosities .",
    "one obvious caveat is that both the jet model and the jet - accretion model treat different components ( e.g. , jet , ssd , adaf ) in an independent way , i.e. , each component can be adjusted almost freely in order to fit observations , although these components are recognized to be tightly related ( we note that @xcite investigated the dynamical impact of outflow / wind onto accretion flow . ) . under the magnetized accretion",
    "ejection structures ( maes ) , @xcite originally investigated the jet emitting disc model ( jed hereafter , see also @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the above two widely - adopted models , this new model has the advantage that it treats both the accretion disc and the ejection it generates consistently . besides , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) speculate that the canonical spectral states of microquasars can be promisingly explained under the jed model .",
    "one of the important next - steps is to apply the jed model to microquasars and derive quantitatively the physical properties ( e.g. accretion rate , ejection rate , etc ) from spectral fitting . the first attempt in this direction",
    "was done by @xcite .",
    "the main spectral features of microquasars spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are demonstrated , and a first comparison to the observations of xte j1118 + 480 is shown ( see e.g. fig .  3 in @xcite ) . to go a bit further , we detail in this paper the seds expected from jed .",
    "several radiative cooling processes are included in this work , i.e. synchrotron and its comptonization , bremsstrahlung and its comptonization , and external comptonization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present the basic properties of the jed model ; numerical results are given in section 3 ; in section 4 , we apply jed model to one individual source  the microquasar xte j1118 + 480 ; section 5 is the summary and discussions .",
    "as stated above , the jet emitting disc model for microquasars is developed from the maes model . with the self - similar assumption in radial direction",
    ", it evolves vertically from the midplane of the resistive magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) disc to the ideal mhd jet .",
    "this geometric configuration is similar to the jet - accretion models @xcite , but the main difference is that accretion and ejection are treated self - consistently . in other words ,",
    "the ejection efficiency is not a free parameter in a jed ( compared to adiabatic inflow - outflow solutions or jet - accretion model ) , but results from the resolution of the full set of dynamical mhd equations without neglecting any term . in this section",
    ", we will only present several key elements and assumptions of the model that are important to the current work .",
    "interested readers are referred to @xcite for related details .      in order to build the jed model ,",
    "several assumptions have been made ( see @xcite for justifications and discussions on these assumptions ) :    \\(i ) the presence of a large scale , well organized , vertical magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "\\(ii ) time - independent and non - relativistic .",
    "the whole system is assumed to be dynamically steady ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we limit ourselves to the non - relativistic mhd framework .",
    "\\(iii ) axisymmetric .",
    "all quantities are independent to the azimuthal angle ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "cylindrical coordinate is adopted .",
    "\\(iv ) single - fluid mhd .",
    "the gases for accretion or ejection are likely to be ionized . for simplicity , we assume the thermal coupling between ions and electrons is fully effective , thus the jed is one - temperature . as argued later in sec .",
    "[ sec : appl ] , the two - temperature structure may be more realistic .",
    "\\(v ) self - similarity in the radial direction .",
    "the full set of the mhd equations can be numerically solved under the self - similar approach , where none of the dynamical terms are ignored .",
    "\\(vi ) @xmath7-prescription on the transport coefficients .",
    "several transporting mechanisms are considered in this model , i.e. the magnetic diffusion ( with coefficient @xmath8 ) , resistivity ( with @xmath9 ) , viscosity ( with @xmath10 ) and thermal conduction ( with @xmath11 ) . for simplicity ( and also because of uncertainty in microphysics ) , the coefficients for these mechanisms are assumed to be the same , following the @xmath7-prescription @xcite .",
    "accretion process in ssd relies on a mechanism to transport angular momentum , which is now commonly accepted to be turbulent viscosity arising from the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "the mri can only work at weak magnetic fields ( i.e. the so - called magneticity @xmath12 ) and will be quenched when @xmath13 approaches unity .",
    "@xmath13 may reasonably be expected to increases as the accreting material moves inward with @xmath14 ) is indeed expected in a stationary state ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , an increase of @xmath13 towards the center would suggest a non stationary situation.](ref .",
    "eq . 4 in @xcite ) , and it is expected that within a transition radius @xmath15 , @xmath13 will be greater than unity and ssd will be truncated to jed . the transition radius should depend on various properties of the accreting material , e.g. the accretion rate , the magnetic diffusion , the magnetic flux , etc .",
    "with all these complexities , we take it as a free parameter throughout the current work . within @xmath15 ,",
    "the jed accretion rate is given as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the accretion rate at @xmath15 ( thus also the accretion rate for the outer ssd ) , and @xmath18 measures the local mass ejection efficiency ( @xcite ) .",

    ", ejections are collimated and can be called `` magnetically - driven '' disc wind which is the same as a self - confined jet .",
    "the ejections ( jets ) will carry away most of the angular momentum allowing the disc material to accrete ( jonathan ferreira , private communication ) .",
    "in other words , the ejection provides an additional torque onto the accretion disc to transport the angular momentum . this ejection torque ( originally defined as jet torque ) , which is highly related to the magnetic fields ,",
    "can be expressed as @xmath22 .",
    "note that there is also a normal turbulent viscous torque , which following @xcite , can be expressed as @xmath23 ( here @xmath24 is the total pressure and @xmath25 is the viscous parameter . ) .",
    "the ratio of the above two torques at the midplane is @xmath26 the steady state ejection with @xmath27 imposes @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "then , the thinner the accretion disk , the more the angular momentum is actually transported by the ejected material .",
    "the importance of the torque imposed by ejecting materials distinguishes the jed from other accretion disc models ( ssd , adaf , etc ) .",
    "now we will present the basic properties of the magnetized accretion flow in jed models .",
    "the thickness is @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the isothermal sound speed , where @xmath24 is the total ( gas+radiation ) pressure and @xmath31 is the gas density at the equatorial plane , and @xmath32 is the keplerian velocity .",
    "we further define the disc aspect ratio as @xmath33 from eq .",
    "( [ lmad ] ) , the total torque ( jet+viscous ) @xmath34 . the sonic mach number can be deduced then from the angular momentum conservation ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath35 . obviously because of the differences in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the ssd is subsonic ( @xmath38 ) , while the jed can be supersonic @xcite .",
    "to simplify our analysis , we fix @xmath39 and the magneticity @xmath40 ( note that the dynamical structure presented below can be easily generalized to other values of @xmath41 and @xmath13 . ) throughout this paper .",
    "we further assume that the disc is gas - pressure supported , i.e. the radiation pressure is negligible ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the basic quantities in a jed can then be written as @xcite @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( here @xmath50 is the eddington accretion rate , and @xmath51 is the eddington luminosity . ) .",
    "the energy in a jed is globally conserved , and it can be written as @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the power dissipated within the jed , which is the sum of the radiated power @xmath54 and the advected power @xmath55 . the ejection power @xmath56 is the energy flux that leaves the two disc surfaces ( @xmath56 is originally defined as @xmath57 , see @xcite ) . the ejections in our model",
    "are magnetically driven , thus their power are dominated by the magnetic part , i.e. the poynting flux .",
    "we thus write @xmath56 as @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the rotational rate of the magnetic field line on the surface @xcite , @xmath60 is the mhd poynting flux , and @xmath61 . where @xmath62 is the differential area of the disc surface .",
    "thus , the fraction of the accretion power carried away by the ejecting materials is @xcite @xmath63 where the parameter @xmath64 is introduced to measure the fraction of magnetic energy that feeds the ejecting materials versus that being dissipated by the joule effect within the jed .",
    "@xmath64 is still poorly constrained ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for the external comptonization @xmath78 where seed photons come from ssd , we assume for simplicity that half of the photons from the multi - temperature blackbody radiation of the outer ( @xmath79 ) ssd @xcite will propagate into the inner ( @xmath80 ) jed region , and scatter ( compton up - scatter ) with the hot electrons there .    in the current work , we simplify the compton scattering calculation by adopting the enhancement factor @xmath81 introduced in @xcite .",

    "the main radiation comes from bremsstrahlung and its comptonization ; in fact , under large optical depth , the spectrum will be multi - blackbody .    however , we should emphasis that the cold branch of the jed model is different from ssd in several aspects .",
    "first , the radial velocity of jed is comparable to the sound speed , while the ssd is highly subsonic .",
    "correspondingly , the optical depth of jed is much smaller than that of ssd with the same accretion rate . in our calculation , the optical depth of cold jed solution is @xmath109 and @xmath110 at radii @xmath15 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "second , the temperature profile of cold jed is different from that of ssd @xcite , especially for cases with larger ejection efficiency @xmath18 .",

    "[ [ eq : ejec ] ] ) in the jed model , for our adopted parameters .",
    "this , together with lower liberated accretion power for the jed model because of mass loss ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : pacc ] ] ) , implies that our jed models have much lower luminosity compared to ssd with the same accretion rate at outer boundary ( see fig .",

    "one important conclusion is that jed shares similar radiative mechanisms to the adaf model at lower accretion rate or the lhaf model at higher accretion rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with the difference that it self - consistently includes ejection .",

    "consequently , the infrared - optical ( @xmath126  hz ) and hard x - ray fluxes will be lower . the spectrum of x - ray is slightly softer .",
    "from above , the hot solution of the jed model can reproduce the spectrum for the hard state of black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "below we focus on the microquasar xte j1118 + 480 .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 was first observed in march 2000 by the",
    "_ rxte _ telescope . during the past years , this source exhibits several outbursts , during which conical hard state is obvious",
    ". one compelling advantage of this source is that , it lies well above the galactic plane ( @xmath127 deg ) , thus remains observable in optical and near - infrared bands due to very low reddening . during the hard state ,",
    "the observations in these bands can reveal the blackbody radiation from the outer ssd , thus help to constrain the transition radius @xmath15 . for our investigations here , we take its black hole mass to be @xmath128 and the distance to be @xmath129 @xcite . the broad - band quasi - simultaneous observational data is collected by @xcite , and we use its 2000 outburst ( circular points in fig .",
    "[ fig:1118 ] ) , which is also investigated in jet - accretion model by @xcite and in jet model by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the radio observation , which originates from the relativistic jet , is not included here for simplicity ( see e.g. , fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:1118 ] a fit obtained with the jed model . in this fit",
    ", the transition radius is found to be @xmath130 and the accretion rate at @xmath15 to be @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore we find the ejection efficiency @xmath132 and the parameter @xmath133 .",
    "our spectral fitting is basically satisfactory .",
    "although our calculation in the compton scattering is simplified , a comparison to the result reproduced by a widely - tested and elaborate compton scattering code ( dot - dot dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:1118 ] , which is based on the work by @xcite , see @xcite for more details ) indicates that our treatment is roughly valid , at least for our application to xte 1118 + 480 here .",
    "the spectral fitting of jed to the observational data requires a large value of @xmath18 .",
    "observationally , this is because , a relatively high outer boundary accretion is required to reproduce the uv bump , while a relatively low jed accretion rate is needed for the x - ray observation .",
    "first through the uv bump fitting ( from outer ssd ) , the outer boundary accretion @xmath17 and the transition radius @xmath15 can be fixed in advance , and then we can adjust the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath64 to fit observations in x - ray bands . because of adjustment of the parameter @xmath64 , which does not change spectral shape ( into a softer spectrum ; see aslo fig . [",
    "fig : jedmodels][d ] ) , we are only able to adjust the ejection efficiency @xmath18",
    ". however , this value lies outside of the suggested parameter range of @xmath18 ( e.g. @xmath134 in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that when heat deposition occurs at the jed upper layers , the value @xmath135 can be reached @xcite . in a word ,",
    "how large can @xmath18 be is an open question , especially if the jed portion of the accretion disc gets irradiated ( jonathan ferreira , private communication ) .",
    "we note that jet - accretion model argues the radiation in the optical wave bands to be from synchrotron ( see e.g. , fig . 2 in @xcite )",
    "thus highly polarized , while the jed model argues the corresponding radiation to be from ssd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1118 ] ) , thus only weak polarization can be observed . at the current stage ,",
    "the jed model is still a single - temperature structure .",
    "however , experience from the development of adaf indicates that , the coupling between electrons and ions is insufficient ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , thus the flow is likely to be a two - temperature structure , with ions much hotter than electrons .",
    "investigating the jed structure and correspondingly the spectrum under two - temperature configuration is beyond the scope of this work , and will leave for future study .    , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "observational data correspond to the march 2000 outburst , which is taken from @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "jed models have been developed and applied to study black hole x - ray binaries in their hard state @xcite and protostellar objects ( @xcite ) . in this work , by including various radiative cooling processes ( external comptonization from outer ssd , synchrotron and its comptonization , and bremsstrahlung and its comptonization ) , we reinvestigate the energy balance properties and seds of the jed model ( for earlier work , see @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently we numerically calculated the spectrum for the stable solutions ( both the cold and the hot branches ) .",
    "we also make a comparison of the cold solution to the widely adopted ssd model .    after reproducing theoretical sed",
    ", we apply this model to the microquasar xte j1118 + 480 as an example .",
    "we find the hard spectrum of xte j1118 + 480 can also be explained by the jed model .",
    "although the physical interactions between the hot accretion flow and ejections ( jet , outflow ) are still not fully understood , they are generally considered as some fundamental components of accretion processes .",
    "many works focus on understanding these physical processes at different accretion rates .",
    "one previous research speculates that there are some common mechanisms responsible for the accretion - ejection connections for all accreting black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , mhd numerical simulations from a hot accretion flow model support the existence of powerful accretion disc winds ( @xcite ) . from observations , there are also some investigations supporting the presence of winds ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; these winds have an equatorial geometry with opening angles of few tens of degrees ( @xcite ) . in the framework of jeds , some further steps on the dynamical properties and radiative features of disc wind",
    "are necessary ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one evident advantage of the jed model is that , it conserved both mass and energy .",
    "part of the accreting material is simultaneously redistributed as ejections self - consistently .",
    "correspondingly , these ejections will also carry away part of the accreting energy ( ref .",
    "[ [ energy ] ] ) .",
    "the disadvantage is that , compared to adaf model , currently the jed model is still a single - temperature one .",
    "however , like adaf , the coupling of electrons and ions in jed is also expected to be weak , thus a two - temperature structure will be formed naturally . in this sense , due to lower electron temperature , the luminosity of the hot jed will be lower than the single - temperature jed model here .",
    "we leave this for future investigations .",
    "we appreciate the anonymous referee for his / her careful reading of our manuscript , and valuable comments and suggestions that significantly improve the demonstration of our work .",
