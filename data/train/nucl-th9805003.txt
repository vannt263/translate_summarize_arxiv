    "the fragmentation of excited nuclei is a complex , time - dependent process .",
    "there exists however experimental evidence if no proof that the decaying system can be treated as a thermodynamically equilibrated assembly of interacting particles , at least in specific experimental circumstances @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the fragmentation process evolves in time by following trajectories in the @xmath0 phase diagram ( @xmath1 is the density and @xmath2 the temperature ) .",
    "it starts at some initial point and ends at a final point when the freeze - out stage is reached . during the time interval",
    "in which this goes on , the initial excited system breaks into fragments and ( or ) evaporates particles .",
    "as far as such a scenario corresponds to a physical realization of the process , one is left with two types of experimentally relevant physical observables .",
    "the first set concerns the thermodynamic properties of the expanding system ( energy , temperature , pressure and correlations between these quantities , possible existence of phase transitions ) .",
    "the second set concerns final fragment size distributions and related observables .",
    "the latter observables have been rather extensively studied in numerous experiments , showing remarkable properties @xcite which were analyzed by means of different types of models .",
    "these analyses lead to the conclusion that the system may undergo a second order transition which lies in the universality class of bond percolation in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of fragmenting nuclei are less well known from the experimental point of view .",
    "there are indications for the existence of two phases which could be analogous to liquid and gas in macroscopic systems .",
    "the order of the transition between the two phases is not clearly established either  @xcite .",
    "successful multifragmentation models  @xcite which are able to reproduce a large amount of experimental data predict a first order transition .",
    "running parallel to the experimental efforts in order to characterize the behaviour of the system , realistic theoretical models should aim and be able to describe both aspects , the thermodynamic properties as well as the characteristics of the fragment size distributions in a consistent way .",
    "this has already been attempted in recent work in the framework of the lattice gas model ( lgm ) @xcite and to some extents by means of homogeneous cellular models @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to present a detailed analysis of both properties by means of a simple though quite realistic model , to identify the phases in which the system can exist and the order of the corresponding phase transitions .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following way . in section 2",
    "we describe the model .",
    "we emphasize its kinship with other models and its specific features . in section 3",
    "we first define the observables which we consider in the sequel and work out the phase diagram which links the density to the temperature .",
    "we then analyze the properties of the phase transitions which appear in the system in section 4 .",
    "we summarize , conclude , present and discuss further possible developments in section 5 .",
    "the lattice gas model ( lgm ) describes the motion of @xmath3 particles inside a three - dimensional cubic lattice , where @xmath1 is the average density , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 the number of sites .",
    "particles which occupy sites in this volume interact only when they are nearest - neighbours .",
    "if @xmath6 are the site occupation numbers ( empty / occupied ) , and @xmath7 is the chemical potential , the hamiltonian reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 are nearest neighbour cells .    the formulation presented in eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) corresponds to the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is the most natural ensemble to be used when describing nuclear fragmentation since nuclei are closed systems with fixed energy and number of particles .",
    "it is usually assumed that the thermodynamic results are the same independently of the formalism used .",
    "of course this is not true with finite systems , because microcanonical , canonical and grand canonical ensembles differ on the level of fluctuations .",
    "but it has recently been argued  @xcite that even in the thermodynamic limit , microcanonical and ( grand)canonical ensembles are not equivalent ( for example , at a first order transition ) .",
    "we shall explicitely show in this paper that in fact the canonical and grand canonical formulations of the lgm are not equivalent .",
    "this happens because there are points in the phase diagram which are accessible when using one formalism , but are not defined ( they are not points of thermodynamic equilibrium ) when using another one . as we will see , this causes the order of the transition to be different in the two formalisms .",
    "this fact leads us naturally to ask about the behaviour of the system in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this is an open problem , but as a first step we will consider here only the detailed study of the canonical formulation to compare it with the well - known grand canonical version of this model . in fact , for sytems with finite volume , the microcanonical ensemble turns out to be very efficient in the study of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "this simple model can be numerically studied , its grand partition function being proportional to the canonical partition function of the ising model with an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in fact , setting @xmath10 the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) becomes @xmath11 where we reinterpret @xmath12 as a spin variable , and identify a spin up with an occupied site , and a spin down with an empty site .",
    "we introduce @xmath13 @xmath14 is called the magnetization in the sequel . as it can be seen , the initial model defined through ( [ ham1 ] ) can indeed be mapped on an ising model with a linear term corresponding to a fixed magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that the ising model with magnetic field @xmath15 presents a discontinuity in the magnetization @xmath16 for @xmath17 at @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the critical temperature .",
    "that is , in the plane @xmath20 there exists a line of first - order transitions @xmath21 , and a second order transition at @xmath22 .",
    "let us see how this is reflected in the case of the lgm . since @xmath15 plays essentially the role of the chemical potential in the grand canonical formulation of the lgm , there is a first order transition in the phase diagram @xmath0 of the lgm , which separates the homogeneous phase from the zone with the two `` liquid '' and `` gas '' phases . on this line",
    ", there exists a critical point at @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "as described below , we aim to introduce a similar type of model in order to describe a finite , excited system of classical particles which interact by means of a short range potential .",
    "we characterize the internal structure of the system by means of a proper definition of physical droplets .",
    "droplets are clusters of particles in which each particle has at least one nearest neighbour .",
    "they exist because of two physical reasons : the attractive nearest - neighbour interaction and the density of particles , which leads to usual percolation when this density is large enough .",
    "however , such clusters are not always stable , because they can break at zones of small connectivity owing to the kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "the simple model ( equivalently , the lgm ) does not take the kinetic energy into account .",
    "we can introduce this energy by means of another definition which takes the energetics of the fragmentation into account  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the stability of a cluster of @xmath25 particles .",
    "if the loss of a particle implies the break of a single bond , then the excess of energy will be @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass of the particles of the lgm .",
    "the cluster is a stable droplet if this excess is positive : @xmath28 this suggests to introduce a bond probability @xmath29 for the nearest neighbour particles to belong to the same droplet : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is distributed according to a maxwell law , that is , the probability for a particle to have a momentum @xmath32 is @xmath33^{3/2 } } \\,\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ p$}}{2mk_\\mathrm{b}t}\\right).\\ ] ] one can see that the choice of the bond probability  ( [ bondprev ] ) allows to extend the argument to the case in which the loss of a particle of the cluster means the break of several bonds  @xcite .",
    "we obtain : @xmath34^{3/2 } } \\int_{\\sqrt{2mj}}^\\infty e^{-p^2/2mk_\\mathrm{b}t}p^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}p \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 1-\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_{\\sqrt{j / k_\\mathrm{b}t}}^\\infty u^2 e^{-u^2 } \\ , \\mathrm{d}u.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] performing a laguerre expansion , one finds  @xcite @xmath35 which shows the similarity between the bond probability definition  ( [ bondprev ] ) and the coniglio - klein distribution of probability @xmath36 we will use this much simpler bond probability to simulate the kinetic energy contribution .",
    "this definition of bond - correlated percolation has also the advantage that the droplets percolate at the thermodynamic transition point with the exponents of the ising model @xcite .",
    "this is not true in general with the site - correlated percolation given by the ising clusters ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the lgm has been introduced in order to describe fragmentation . in refs .",
    "@xcite several analytical simplifications were made on the model , as well as numerical simulations taking the analogy with the ising model at fixed magnetic field .",
    "the authors used a definition of droplets which lead the thermal critical point to coincide with a percolation point . recently the authors of refs .  @xcite",
    "have also considered isospin - dependent interactions , and they have determined the distribution of clusters together with other observables @xcite .",
    "similar studies can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that there exists a full line , not only a single point , in the phase diagram of the lgm , for densities larger than 0.5 , where distributions of fragment sizes which obey a power law distribution are obtained . on this line , which is very close to the kertsz line @xcite , one finds a phase transition because the droplets are defined with a physical prescription . along this transition , there are no discontinuities for any thermodynamic quantities ( energy , specific heat , ... ) .",
    "however , for some nonlocal quantities , as clusters , a discontinuity appears .",
    "the critical exponents along this line ( outside of the critical point ) should give some clue about the kinship with a percolation transition .",
    "in all the numerical calculations mentioned above , the lgm is equivalent to the ising model with a constant magnetic field .",
    "this corresponds to a fixed chemical potential .",
    "hence the number of particles ( and consequently , the density ) is conserved on the average in the framework of the grand canonical formalism . for systems as small as nuclei , it is certainly appropriate to consider the model with a fixed number of particles , which corresponds to the canonical ensemble . as it was stated above , the nucleus is a closed system without heat bath . under these conditions ,",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is the most appropriate formalism to use , but we will leave the constraint of the energy as an open problem and concentrate on the crucial difference which exists between the canonical and the grand canonical in this case .",
    "the reason is that the constraint of fixed number of particles can not always be satisfied with the last formalism , in sharp contrast with the situation in the former framework as we shall see .",
    "the lgm in the canonical formalism is just the ising model with fixed magnetization ( imfm ) , here with fixed number of particles .",
    "we introduce the following partition function @xmath38}e^{\\beta\\sum_{\\langle i j      \\rangle } \\sigma_i\\sigma_j}\\,\\cdot \\delta(m-\\hat m ) , \\label{model}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 ( we take @xmath40 for simplicity ) , @xmath41 $ ] is a fixed number , and the delta function constrains the configurations @xmath42 $ ] which contribute to the sum to those with fixed density , so that @xmath43 , where @xmath14 is defined in ( [ density ] ) above .    as already stated above , the grand canonical formalism of the lgm is the ising model with constant @xmath15 . of course an ising model with a magnetic field",
    "@xmath15 which produces a magnetization @xmath44 at a certain value of @xmath45 is equivalent in the thermodynamic limit ( that is , it gives the same value for the different observables ) to the model ( [ model ] ) with magnetization @xmath46 and the same @xmath45 .",
    "this is so because in the limit @xmath47 , the fluctuations in @xmath14 are negligible , and the distribution is a dirac delta centered in @xmath44 .",
    "but , reversely , the description of a model with fixed magnetization is not necessarily equivalent to a model with fixed magnetic field in the grand canonical ensemble : in the lgm ( we will refer from now on to the lgm as the model considered in the grand canonical formalism ) , we obtain a certain mean magnetization ( or density , see eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) ) with a magnetic field @xmath15 at some value of @xmath45 .",
    "when we increase @xmath45 , we have to lower @xmath15 in order to get the same value of @xmath44 .",
    "it is always possible to find a value of @xmath15 which gives a fixed @xmath44 while @xmath48 .",
    "however , for @xmath49 , there is an spontaneous magnetization @xmath50 , and the presence of a magnetic field @xmath51 can only increase @xmath52 , therefore values of @xmath53 , are not accessible in the grand canonical formalism .",
    "in fact , these non - equilibrium states are separated from the normal states by the first order transition in @xmath45 mentioned in section 2.1 .",
    "however , we can still consider the values of @xmath45 and the magnetization that correspond to non - equilibrium states in the lgm , in the framework of the model ( [ model ] ) .",
    "they will correspond to a definite mean value of the energy , for example .",
    "these points of the phase diagram are points of thermodynamic equilibrium of the model ( [ model ] ) .",
    "hence one may ask about the behaviour of the energy when crossing the corresponding transition point of the lgm and the existence of a phase transition at this point in the present model .",
    "we aim to investigate this point in the sequel , as well as its consequence on the behaviour of the fragment size distributions .",
    "the ising model with constant order parameter ( magnetization @xmath14 ) has been considered previously from the point of view of its critical dynamic exponents ( see , eg @xcite ) , but it seems that its equilibrium properties have not been addressed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding dynamics would be in principle that of the kawasaki spin exchange model @xcite , but , as the authors of @xcite noted , one should take special care with the detailed balance in a numerical algorithm for this model .    in our monte carlo computations ,",
    "the following update algorithm has been used : two spins are picked up at random , and they are exchanged according to the standard metropolis prescription @xcite only if they have different signs .",
    "this algorithm preserves the magnetization ( that is , the number of spins up , which represent the particles ) , and it can easily be seen that it satisfies detailed balance .",
    "in fact it is striking to notice how one can arrive to non - boltzmann distributions if one does not care very much about the update procedure .",
    "for example , we also considered the following algorithm : take one spin sequentially on the lattice and another one at random , and exchange them only if they have different signs .",
    "this does not satisfy detailed balance , as the following argument shows .",
    "consider an initial configuration with every spin up except for a single spin down .",
    "suppose that the sequential process is such that we have to take the spin at the position @xmath54 , which is up . with the algorithm described ,",
    "there is only a possible final configuration , the one in which the spin down has been exchanged with the spin up at @xmath54 .",
    "if we consider now the reverse process , we have to exchange the spin down at @xmath54 with a spin up .",
    "but now we have many final configurations , not only the initial one , so it is clear that this process does not satisfy detailed balance .",
    "we can modify this sequential algorithm to solve the problem .",
    "if the spins taken sequentially and randomly are always exchanged , independently of their sign , detailed balance is restored .",
    "we verified this numerically , so that the results with this last algorithm were the same as with the ` full randomly ' algorithm described above . in fact , an interesting property of this ` random ' algorithm in which the two spins are taken at random is that here one can choose exchanging the spins in every case , or only when having different signs .",
    "both situations verify detailed balance , as we checked numerically , thanks to the randomness in the choice of the spins .",
    "similar subtleties happen in algorithms where nearest neighbours are exchanged , as in kawasaki dynamics , which were first noted in @xcite .",
    "we simulate the imfm , defined by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , in a three - dimensional cube of @xmath55 sites , and with @xmath3 spins up and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we work out the phase diagram in the @xmath56 plane .",
    "the thermodynamic observables are the energy @xmath57 and its @xmath45 derivative , the specific heat @xmath58    the droplet observable which we consider is the second momentum @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of droplets of size @xmath61 , and the sum extends over all droplets except for the largest one .",
    "the droplets are defined from the ising clusters with the probability law ( [ bond ] ) . with this definition ,",
    "the transition properties of the thermodynamic transition , given by the divergence of @xmath62 , and the droplet transition , given by the divergence of @xmath63 , coincide in the standard ising model ( constant magnetic field ) at @xmath18 .",
    "we want to see whether this is also the case in the imfm .      the phase diagram of the imfm should be the same as the one of the lgm because the thermodynamic relations between the different quantities must be the same in the domain where the lgm displays an homogeneous phase .",
    "the thermodynamic transition lines must coincide in both phase diagrams .",
    "however , the nature of this transition can be different , as noticed above .",
    "we can also understand physically the existence of a phase transition in the ising model with constant magnetization with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig : phd1 ] .",
    "it shows the curve @xmath64 for the usual ising model at @xmath18 magnetic field . constraining the system to move in @xmath2 with fixed magnetization @xmath65 ( indicated by the dashed line ) will be equivalent to pass through ising models with different values of @xmath15 ( those which give the magnetization @xmath66 at each @xmath2 ) , until one finally reaches the @xmath64 curve corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "then it is not possible to go to the left in the usual ising model with any magnetic field , but this is possible with the present model .",
    "one expects a phase transition at that point , and this will be confirmed below .",
    "therefore , the curve @xmath64 plotted in fig .  [ fig : phd1 ] will exactly correspond to the transition line of this model in the @xmath56 plane .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phd2 ] we plot the phase diagram obtained directly in a numerical simulation of an @xmath67 lattice .",
    "we represent the thermodynamic transition ( maximum of the specific heat , divergence in the infinite volume limit ) and the droplet transition ( maximum of @xmath63 ) .",
    "for @xmath67 these transitions are different , but a priori this could be a finite size effect .",
    "we shall see in the next sections whether these two transitions are the same .",
    "the thermodynamic transition is symmetric with respect to @xmath23 , because the thermodynamic properties are the same in terms of spins up or down , that is , the model has a symmetry @xmath68 which corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "the droplet transition is not symmetric because we define only droplets for sites corresponding to @xmath70 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phd2 ] the thermodynamic transition for @xmath67 presents an `` anomaly '' at @xmath23 so that the curve seems not to be concave there .",
    "this is a finite size effect , due to the fact that the critical exponents vary along the line , as we will see in section 4 .",
    "then the thermodynamic limit is reached differently at different points on the line .",
    "actually , we have included in the figure the infinite volume curve obtained from the values of the critical points at @xmath71 and @xmath23 calculated in section 4.3 .",
    "the region a in fig .",
    "[ fig : phd2 ] is the disordered region , b is a region where an infinite cluster is formed but the spin system , from a thermodynamic point of view , is disordered , and c is a region with an infinite cluster which also corresponds to an ordered thermodynamic system . the thermodynamic transition is the line which separates the regions b and c , and the droplet transition is the one which separates the regions a and b.    the physical origin of the infinite cluster is , on the one hand , the ising - type interaction , which , in the nuclear context , simulates the strong interaction between the particles .",
    "the most probable configuration for large @xmath45 is that with all spins up together , forming a spherical cluster .",
    "this is only relevant in region c. on the other hand , the density also influences the development of clusters , because we know that , even in absence of interaction , the system percolates when there are many particles .",
    "this effect appears in region b , and this is the reason why the droplet transition separates from the thermodynamic one for large values of @xmath1 . besides that",
    ", @xmath45 also influences the formation of physical droplets through the bond probability ( [ bond ] ) , simulating a kinetic energy for the particles depending on the temperature : the lower the temperature , the less the particles can move .    far inside the ordered phase , the system favours the configuration which minimizes the energy , and then a large cluster is formed .",
    "all occupied sites inside the cluster contribute positively to the energy , as well as those outside the cluster ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the only contributions with @xmath73 are those located at the border , so that the configuration will show a minimal surface , something very similar to a sphere .",
    "one can estimate the energy in this case .",
    "let us consider a cubic shape for this cluster .",
    "then , the total amount of ( potential ) energy is @xmath74 so that @xmath75 and in the thermodynamic limit @xmath76 , @xmath77 is normalized to 1 .",

    "( [ energy ] ) and ( [ cv ] ) .      along the droplet transition ,",
    "the observable @xmath63 diverges , because there the fragment size distribution @xmath60 follows a power law @xmath79    a possible fragmentation scenario can be suggested in the @xmath56 diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phd2 ] ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "consider a nuclear collision leading to an excited system of @xmath80 particles in a volume @xmath5 , in thermodynamic equilibrium or at least close to it .",
    "this point would correspond to a rather large density ( @xmath81 ) and small @xmath45 ( large temperature ) , lying below the droplet transition line .",
    "the trajectory would then move towards decreasing @xmath1 and increasing @xmath45 .",
    "it would cross the critical droplet line at some point @xmath82 and pursue its way towards lower density and temperature , up to some freeze - out where the fragment size distribution gets fixed . from thereon",
    "the system would continue to cool down and expand continuously , crossing the thermodynamic transition line at some other point . in practice , of course",
    ", the system follows a whole set of trajectories corresponding to different experimental initial conditions ( system , energy , impact parameter , ... ) .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to get direct information about these trajectories .",
    "there could exist indications that the crossing of the critical droplet line may occur for rather high values of the density .",
    "in fact , indirect experimental information ( agreement with percolation results ) indicates that the exponent @xmath83 could lie close to the value 2.2 which corresponds to @xmath84 ( see section 4.4 below ) . on the other hand , molecular dynamics ( md )",
    "calculations seem to indicate that the system breaks up rather early during the collision process @xcite . whether the critical @xmath83 can be put in direct correspondence with experimental measurements of fragment distributions which correspond to averages over different events",
    "remains however an unsettled question .",
    "as we have seen , the phase diagram of the imfm shows , in principle , two phase transitions .",
    "we may ask whether these two transitions coincide for small values of @xmath1 , the type of thermodynamic transition and what is its order , its universality class , and the value of the exponent @xmath83 , whether it is constant or not along the transition line .    the critical exponents will bring an answer to these questions .",
    "we have two observables which diverge at their corresponding transitions in the thermodynamic limit , the specific heat @xmath85 which defines the exponent @xmath86 , and the second momentum @xmath87 which defines the exponent @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to the thermodynamic and droplet transition respectively .",
    "note that in principle , the exponents of the thermodynamic and droplet transitions will be independent , because we have two different models : ising ( with fixed magnetization ) , and a bond - percolation correlated model , constructed on the imfm system .",
    "we know that in the case of the standard ising model , the definition ( [ bond ] ) of the bond probability is such that the thermodynamic and the droplet exponents are the same , and the position of the transitions coincide . but this could be different in the present case . actually , the exponent @xmath91 , defined as the one which gives the divergence of the magnetic susceptibility , is not defined for the imfm , because we keep the magnetization fixed as an external parameter .",
    "this is also the case of the remaining `` magnetic '' exponents , @xmath45 and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the universality class of the imfm will be completely determined by @xmath86 and @xmath93 , which should obey the hyperscaling relation @xmath94 we will denote the exponents corresponding to the droplet transition with a little bar above the corresponding greek letter .",
    "we can measure critical exponents from standard finite size scaling @xcite . for finite lattice size @xmath95 ,",

    "the exponents of the droplet transition will also obey the corresponding scaling and hyperscaling relations @xmath102 where these exponents are defined by the behaviour of various moments of the cluster size distributions , see eg @xcite .",
    "using scaling and hyperscaling with @xmath103 , the exponent @xmath83 of the distribution of fragments can be obtained directly from @xmath104 : @xmath105 so that if @xmath104 is small ( which is usually the case ) , @xmath83 is @xmath106 modified by a small amount .",
    "we remark that for all the models with small @xmath104 ( and for all the standard models in three dimensions , @xmath107 ) , @xmath83 can only vary between 2.1 and 2.3 .",
    "the only nontrivial result is the deviation from 2.2",

    "this agrees with our conclusion at the end of the last section that a compatibility with the ising exponents should not be discarded at @xmath23 .    finally , we see from ( [ fit07 ] ) that a fit to @xmath116 in the @xmath117 limit is also possible with these data . however , the value of @xmath118 is now less than @xmath119 and has no relation with exponent @xmath93 .",
    "we know that the droplet transition line must end at the bond - percolation point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phd2 ] ) , so that we expect that this fit is a spurious effect , or , equivalently , that exponent @xmath118 in this kind of fit will approach zero for larger lattice sizes .",
    "we then conclude that for @xmath84 the thermodynamic and droplet transitions are different .",
    "in the present work we presented and analyzed a simple though realistic @xmath115 ising - type model with fixed magnetization ( density ) which we considered as a generic description of nuclear matter fragmentation in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we worked out the phase diagram of the system in terms of density and temperature .",
    "we analyzed the thermodynamic properties of the system as well as the properties of the size distribution of bound fragments .",
    "for compact systems ( relative density larger than 0.5 ) we found two types of transitions , one corresponding to a percolation transition for the system which breaks into pieces , and a thermodynamic transition at lower temperature . for dilute systems ( relative density lower than 0.3 ) , which should correspond to situations where the expanding system reaches the freeze - out point , the two transitions merge and the exponents related to the thermodynamics and the fragment distributions change with the density .",
    "there are strong indications that the scaling and hyperscaling relations between the exponents are satisfied . in all cases which were worked out numerical results",
    "indicate that the transitions can be interpreted as being second order .",
    "for this reason , one can not expect to observe the experimentally controversed latent heat plateau in the caloric curve , at least not in a clear - cut way in the small systems which we considered here .",
    "one may perhaps argue here that the energy fluctuations which are present in the canonical treatment performed here smear out the energy and hence preclude a clear - cut observation of the plateau .",
    "we insist however on the fact that the critical exponents definitely tell us that the transitions are second order as already mentioned above even if at the present stage of our investigations we can not say with certitude to which universality class the transitions belong ( it seems clear , however , that they experiment a soft variation along the transition line ) . actually , the fact that the transition is first order for non - fixed magnetization , and second order when the magnetization is fixed could have been expected somehow . for a fixed magnetization ,",
    "the configuration space is smaller , there are less fluctuations , and it is natural that the transition gets weaker .",
    "it remains nevertheless true that the fragmenting nuclear system is isolated ( if one considers the _ whole _ system which enters the reaction process leading to its fragmentation ) which justifies a microcanonical treatment as advertised by d. gross and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it may be worthwhile to consider this point , although it is not clear to us whether it would clarify the situation since in the microcanonical ensemble it is the temperature which fluctuates strongly at the transition points for fixed energy , when the reverse is true in the canonical ensemble .",
    "it is our aim to work out the present model in this framework in the next future .",
    "last but not least , the present work shows clearly that models which describe finite size systems and which differ by seemingly harmless characteristics ( strictly fixed number of particles in imfm here , fixed number of particles in the average in the lgm ) can lead to quite different results as far as the order of the transition is concerned .",
    "experimental data should be enough precise and complete in order to be able to distinguish between details like the order of the transition .",
    "this is certainly a great challenge and an incentive to improve our information about the properties of fragmenting nuclei .",
