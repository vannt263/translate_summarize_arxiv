    "as a kind of new state of matter , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a dilute gas of trapped atoms is able to exhibit quantum phenomena on macroscopic scales @xcite .",
    "different from pure single - particle behaviour , the interparticle interaction between condensate atoms gives rise to many intriguing nonlinear phenomena .",
    "one important example is the dynamics of a condensate trapped in a double - well potential . in this system ,",
    "the condensate undergoes either josephson oscillation where the population oscillates sinusoidally between the two wells , or self trapping in which most atoms remain trapped in one of the wells .",
    "this has been theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",

    ", the polariton represents the excitation of the eigenmodes of the light - matter system inside the microcavity , which can be manipulated and generated by the external laser field .",
    "the interaction between the polaritons can take the form of kerr nonlinearity , which occurs if atoms with a specific level structure interact with light @xcite .",
    "such kind of controllable and strong kerr nonlinearity can be used to simulate strongly correlated many - body models in photon - coupled microcavity arrays @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a scheme for simulating the tunneling between two polariton condensates in the microcavity system . here , compared with the case of bec in a double - well potential , two spatially localized bosonic modes are replaced with two different modes of polaritons in the same cavity . under proper arrangement , the effective nonlinear tunneling between the two polariton condensates can be easily induced and controlled by external fields . in our work , we derive a two - mode model that describes the system .",
    "a salient feature is that the tunneling rate between the two modes takes a nonlinear form that depends on the difference of the population in the modes . under the mean - field approximation ,",
    "such nonlinear hamiltonian will be reduced to a new nonrigid pendulum model , in which not only the magnitude , but also the sign of the pendulum length can be changed .",
