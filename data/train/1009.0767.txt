    "the discovery of the double - peaked broad - line agn sdss  j153636.221 + 044127.0 @xcite prompted @xcite to reiterate the  smoking gun \" criteria for the confirmation of a binary smbh .",

    "nevertheless , at least five of the type-1 systems are definitely mergers , as we measured small ( hundreds km s@xmath17 ) redshift differences between the components with spatially resolved spectroscopy ( h. fu et al .",

    "we used galfit @xcite to model the merging systems .",
    "psfs were taken either from stellar sources inside the same image or from time - adjacent images with similar tip - tilt configurations .",
    "we matched the combined magnitudes of the merging components to their 2mass magnitudes because the components are mostly unresolved in 2mass ( except for 1157 + 0816 ) .",

    "the @xmath21 magnitudes of the merging components differ by less than 1.2 magnitudes , satisfying the definition of a major merger ( mass ratio @xmath24 given a constant mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "note that the primary components of many type-1 systems are brightened by the central point sources .",
    "for that reason , 0952 + 2552 is likely a major merger even though it shows a magnitude difference of 1.6 mag .",
    "the 16 multiple component sources split evenly between type-1s and type-2s . because we observed a total of 17 type-1s and 33 type-2s , the merger fraction of type-1s ( @xmath3% ) is greater than that of type-2s ( @xmath4% ) .",
    "this is surprising because it should be more difficult to detect extended companion galaxies around type-1s than type-2s owing to the bright nuclei of the former .    in light of the rapid evolution of galaxy merger fraction at @xmath25 ( see the model of * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for observational constraints ) , the higher merger fraction in type-1s is likely a result of the distinct redshift distributions of type-1 and type-2 agns ( figure  [ fig : resolve ] ) , as opposed to an intrinsic difference between the two groups .",
    "ideally , we would want to compare the merger fraction of agns with our data . in practice ,",
    "the former is not well determined because of the lack of high - resolution images and the rarity of agns in deep cosmological surveys .",

    "[ fig : resolve ] we compare our data with the result of @xcite ( @xmath27 ) , who determined the evolution of galaxy merger fraction using cosmos acs images after statistically removing spurious mergers by simulating the appearance of real low - redshift sdss galaxies at @xmath28 .",
    "our data are consistent with the evolution of the major merger fraction in typical @xmath8 galaxies , although a larger sample is clearly needed to improve the statistics . note that by selection mergers are over an order - of - magnitude more common in double - peaked agns than in @xmath8 galaxies in the same redshift range ( see the compilation of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relation suggests that black hole masses correlate tightly with the velocity dispersions of stellar bulges ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "although the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relation is considered fundamental , it remains under debate whether active galaxies and inactive galaxies lie on the same @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relation .",
    "the small sample of reverberation - mapped seyfert 1 galaxies suggest that they do ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the larger sample of sdss agns suggest not @xcite .",
    "the latter groups used single - epoch spectra to estimate black hole masses and found that the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relation of agns is shallower than that of quiescent galaxies .",
    "one of the main differences between reverberation and single - epoch black hole masses is that the former uses the the width of the _ variable _ part of the broad emission line measured from root mean square ( rms ) spectra @xcite .",
    "single - epoch emission line widths show @xmath1125% variation when compared with the rms line widths @xcite .",
    "as the black hole mass depends sensitively on the line width , this variation may lead to the discrepancy in the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relations .",
    "on the other hand , agns involved in galaxy mergers can easily deviate from the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relation because the velocity dispersions are broadened by the relative motions of the components . to test this idea , we measured single - epoch black hole masses and velocity dispersions for the broad - line agns in our sample .",
    "because velocity dispersion measurements require a significant host galaxy contribution in the optical spectra , we were only able to measure velocity dispersions in four type-1 agns in our sample ( 1239 + 5314 , 1307 + 4604 , 1532 + 4203 , and 1610 + 1308 ) .",
    "we measured single - epoch black hole masses with the sdss spectra and the calibration of @xcite .",
    "we measured fwhms of the broad h@xmath29 or h@xmath30 lines .",
    "we did not decompose the broad lines for the kinematic components seen in the double - peaked narrow lines , because ( 1 ) the decomposition result would be highly uncertain , and ( 2 ) the companions of the type-1 agns are unlikely to be type-1 agns since most of them look extended from the lgsao images .",

    ", we also included 0.1 dex uncertainty in the virial coefficient @xcite and 0.2 dex uncertainty in the size - luminosity relation of the broad line regions @xcite in the 1-@xmath33 uncertainty of black hole masses .",
    "we measured stellar velocity dispersions using the same sdss spectra with the idl routine _ vdispfit _ , which determines the velocity dispersion and its error by fitting the galaxy spectrum with a number of gaussian - broadened stellar template spectra .",
    "we masked out emission lines , telluric absorption , and artifacts from sky subtraction in the fitting .",
    "following @xcite , the velocity dispersions were corrected for the 3  fiber size , which changes @xmath7  by less than 10% at @xmath34 . for the object in common ( 1239 + 5314 ) , our measurement ( @xmath35 km s@xmath17 ) agrees with that of @xcite ( @xmath36 km s@xmath17 ) .",

    "the two double - peaked agns in mergers fall significantly below the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relations of inactive galaxies and reverberation - mapped seyfert 1s , while the isolated double - peaked agns lie on the relations within the 1-@xmath33 scatter .",
    "this result highlights the importance of identifying mergers with high - resolution imaging before comparing the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relation of agns and normal galaxies . on the other hand",

    "it is natural to investigate whether the merging double - peaked agns look different from the isolated double - peaked agns in terms of their [ oiii ]  profiles .",

    "@xcite found an anti - correlation between flux ratio and velocity shift ratio of the [ oiii ]  components , which they interpreted as an indication of the orbital motion of binary agns .",
    "such an anti - correlation is expected if ( 1 ) the [ oiii ]  luminosities correlate with the black hole masses , and ( 2 ) the black hole masses correlates with the bulge masses ( the magorrian relation ) . for the former statement to hold , they had to assume identical bolometric corrections and eddington ratios for both components in each binary system .",
    "for the subsample where systemic redshifts could be measured from stellar absorption lines ( compiled from @xcite ) , we found that both merging and isolated double - peaked agns fall on the same anti - correlation with similar dispersions ( fig .",

    "these results show that other mechanisms , such as jet - driven outflows , extended emission - line nebulae , and peculiar kinematics in the narrow line regions , can produce the same double - peaked line profiles _ and _ the apparent virial relation of @xcite .",

    "* ) . a similar fraction of merging type-2s are radio detected ( 38% , 3/8 ) . therefore , jet - cloud interactions should also be an important mechanism in producing double - peaked emission - lines in agn mergers .",
    "in recent years , there has been a flurry of observational and theoretical research on binary smbhs / agns .",
    "although a few binary smbh / agn candidates have been known since late nineties @xcite , the availability of large spectroscopic surveys such as sdss has rejuvenated this subject and enabled systematic searches for large samples of binary candidates based on spectroscopic signatures indicating potentially two agn components orbiting each other .",
    "the recent progress is driven by the predictions of the standard hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm , the lack of an observational understanding of the formation and evolution of binary smbhs , and the requirement for making predictions of gravitational wave signals potentially detectable by ligo and the future laser interferometry mission ( lisa ) .    with several published catalogs of binary agn candidates ,",
    "the remaining critical issue is to determine the characteristics of a true binary agn and the fraction of genuine binary agns among the candidates .",
    "we carried out a high - resolution imaging survey of double - peaked sdss agns .",
    "the experiment was designed to differentiate mergers from contaminating sources involving single agns . in 50 sources we found 16 that are apparently undergoing mergers .",
    "our analyses demonstrate clearly that a large percentage ( @xmath1070% ) of these binary agn candidates are isolated agns .",
    "their double peaked [ oiii ]  line profiles could be explained by several other processes , as discussed in   [",
    "sec : id_bagn ] .",
    "because only @xmath111% of the sdss agns show double - peaked line profiles , the @xmath1130% merger fraction thus indicates a kpc - scale binary agn fraction of @xmath400.3% , which is comparable to the fraction of agn pairs with @xmath1010 kpc transverse separations ( @xmath110.1% ) .",
    "there are several factors that make this binary fraction just an order of magnitude estimate .",

    "<S> as a natural consequence of galaxy mergers , binary active galactic nuclei ( agns ) should be commonplace . nevertheless , observational confirmations are rare , especially for binaries with separations less than ten kpc . </S>",
    "<S> such a system may show two sets of narrow emission lines in a single spectrum owing to the orbital motion of the binary . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained high - resolution near - infrared images of 50 double - peaked [ oiii]@xmath05007 agns with the keckii laser guide star adaptive optics system . </S>",
    "<S> the sloan digital sky survey sample is compiled from the literature and consists of 17 type-1 agns between @xmath1 and 33 type-2 agns between @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the new images reveal eight type-1 and eight type-2 sources that are apparently undergoing mergers . </S>",
    "<S> these are strong candidates of kpc - scale binary agns , because they show multiple components separated between 0.6 and 12 kpc and often disturbed morphologies . because most of the type-1s are at higher redshifts than the type-2s , the higher merger fraction of type-1s ( @xmath3% ) compared to that of type-2s ( @xmath4% ) </S>",
    "<S> can be attributed to the general evolution of galaxy merger fraction with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that agn mergers are outliers of the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relation because of over - estimated stellar velocity dispersions , illustrating the importance of removing mergers from the samples defining the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  relations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the emission - line properties are indistinguishable for spatially resolved and unresolved sources , emphasizing that scenarios involving a single agn can produce the same double - peaked line profiles and they account for at least 70% of the double - peaked [ oiii ]  agns . </S>"
