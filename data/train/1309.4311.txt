    "<S> the running coupling freezes at @xmath132 as @xmath3 is taken to zero , rendering the theory scale invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> the crucial point is that at larger couplings the full , pure gauge @xmath4 function is significantly smaller ( in absolute terms ) than its four - loop counterpart . that gives the fermionic part considerably more weight . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : c ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath138 we do not know @xmath134 , but it is expected that it drops to zero with some power of the lattice constant , faster than the perturbative series , as @xmath139 . regarding larger loops , it has been argued  @xcite that the nonperturbative contribution , or pieces of it , might increase as the size of the loop is increased . </S>",
    "<S> we do not see such a behavior  @xcite ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 19 , right panel ) , but can not exclude it presently for @xmath140 . if at all , the argument might apply to quadratic loops , but certainly not to @xmath14 . to probe the @xmath4 function in the vicinity of the infrared fixed point , it will be sufficient to consider wilson loops of spatial extent @xmath141 ( see below ) .    to conclude , we have computed the su(3 ) pure gauge @xmath4 function from wilson loops to @xmath0 order numerical stochastic perturbation theory . </S>",

    "<S> , we intend to compute @xmath147 for a few representative loops . </S>",
    "<S> last not least , larger lattices will allow us to probe the @xmath4 function at even larger values of the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> to corroborate our results on the infrared fixed point of the qcd @xmath4 function for a small number of massless quarks beyond any doubts , we would need to compute the fermionic contribution to higher loops . </S>",
    "<S> that appears to be feasible . in  @xcite numerical stochastic perturbation theory </S>",
