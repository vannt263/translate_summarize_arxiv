    "cold fermionic gases provide a unique arena for the study of strongly correlated matter . in these systems",
    "the @xmath3-wave interaction between atoms can be controlled by altering an external magnetic field .",
    "the dimensionless parameter that governs the interaction is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the @xmath3-wave scattering length and @xmath6 is the magnitude of the fermi momentum . in a homogeneous fermi gas the latter is related to the particle density by @xmath7 .",
    "the fermi momentum also defines a temperature scale , the fermi temperature by @xmath8 . tuning the system into a feshbach resonant state corresponds to the limit @xmath9 . in this regime",
    "the interaction cross section is limited only by unitarity .",

    "it behaves as a weakly interacting gas , but in the low @xmath10 limit it is a strongly correlated quantum fluid , which shares many interesting properties with other strongly interacting systems .",

    "the crossover between the bec and bcs regimes is known to be smooth @xcite . as the temperature",
    "is increased the superfluid fermi gas undergoes a phase transition to a normal fluid . on the bec side",
    "this is the einstein transition , which occurs at a critical temperature @xmath11 . in the bcs regime",
    "the critical temperature is exponentially small compared to @xmath12 .",
    "the maximum transition temperature @xmath13 is achieved slightly on the bec side of the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "it is natural to ask how transport properties of the fluid change along the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "the bulk viscosity , for example , vanishes at unitarity but is expected to be non - zero on either side of the feshbach resonance . in kinetic theory bulk viscosity is thought to arise from scale invariance breaking encoded in the density dependence of the effective fermion mass @xcite . the shear viscosity , on the other hand",
    ", is expected to be large in the bcs and bec limits and become minimal close to unitarity .",
    "indeed , kinetic theory in the high temperature limit predicts that the shear viscosity has a minimum exactly at unitarity @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of the shear viscosity at unitarity and at temperatures close to the phase transition have been reported in @xcite .",
    "these experiments obtain values for @xmath14 , the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density , that are only a few times larger than the conjectured universal bound @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "the shear viscosity is independent of @xmath20 and has a minimum at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this minimum at unitarity is a simple consequence of the maximum in the vacuum cross section at resonance .",
    "we will show that including medium effects in the scattering amplitude shifts the minimum away from unitarity .",
    "the physical reason for this behavior is related to pauli blocking in the in - medium scattering amplitude , which is more efficient on the bcs side .",
    "formally , the minimum in the shear viscosity arises from the competition between @xmath21 and @xmath22 corrections to @xmath23 .",
    "we will show that it is possible to compute all one- and two - body effects of order @xmath24 .",
    "in addition to in - medium corrections to the scattering amplitude , these terms arise from medium corrections to the quasi - particle energy and velocity .",
