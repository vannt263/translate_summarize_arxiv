    "in @xcite a family of orthogonal polynomials has been introduced based on a three ",

    "this operator occurs in the symmetric treatment of the quantum few ",
    "body problem as well as in spin ",
    "network modeling of a quantum of space , as pointed out originally in @xcite . in this section a short introduction to the necessary mathematical background will be given , together with a summary of a few significant results found by the authors in @xcite .",
    "improved insights into algebraic and analytical aspects of the subject will be provided in the next sections .",
    "+ the theory of ( re)coupling of eigenstates of three @xmath0 angular momentum operators @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 to states of sharp total angular momentum @xmath4 ( with projection @xmath5 along the quantization axis ) is usually carried out in the setting of ` binary couplings ' ( see @xcite , topic 12 and original references therein ) . referring to the ordered triple as above , the admissible schemes are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are denoted @xmath8s are labelings of the eigenvalues associated with the angular momentum operators ( _ e.g. _ @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath11 ) running over @xmath12 , in @xmath13 units , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the eigenvalue of @xmath5 with @xmath16 in integer steps .",
    "thus the ket vectors above belong to hilbert spaces representing simultaneous eigenspaces of the two , partially overlapping sets of commuting operators @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , respectively ) . the racah  wigner @xmath23 symbol is the unitary ( actually orthogonal by condon-shortley convention ) transformation relating the two sets ( [ jbasis ] ) according to @xmath24^{1/2}\\ , \\,\\begin{bmatrix } j_1 & j_2 & j_{12 } \\\\",
    "j_3 & j_4 & j_{23 } \\end{bmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and the weights @xmath26 are the dimensions of the spin@xmath27 representations of @xmath0 which provide the standard normalization of such a ` recoupling coefficient ' as encoded in the shorthand notation in the left  hand side .",
    "therefore a basis transform is simply written as @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 while the inverse one is achieved by the transpose @xmath31 ( all non  null matrix elements obey the selection rule @xmath32 by wigner  eckart theorem ) .",
    "recall in passing that the @xmath23 symbol in ( [ seij ] ) encodes naturally the symmetry of an euclidean tetrahedron , a fact which is at the basis of the huge amount of literature about ` spin  network ' models for 3dimensional discretized quantum gravity and quantum computing flourished in the past two decades ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the treatment of the ` symmetric ' coupling scheme for the addition of three @xmath0 angular momenta @xmath33 to give @xmath34 ( with projection @xmath5 ) is characterized in terms of a ` volume ' operator @xmath35 @xmath36 . unlike what happens with binary coupling schemes , the @xmath37s appear now to be all on the same footing , indicating that the volume operator can be thought of as acting democratically on either a composite system of four objects with vanishing total angular momentum ( a configuration that can be associated with a not necessarily planar quadrilateral vector diagram @xmath38 ) , or a system of three objects with total angular momentum @xmath34 ( see again @xcite , topic 12 , last section , and original references therein ) .",
    "the present scheme is characterized by the six commuting hermitian operators @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath5 , so that eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath39 are given formally ( consistently with the notation used in ( [ jbasis ] ) ) as latexmath:[\\[\\label{kbasisl }    eigenvalues and matrix elements of @xmath39 are naturally found within an imaginary antisymmetric representation based on a three  terms recursion relationship @xcite , which can be turned into a real , time  independent schrdinger equation which governs the dynamics of a ` quantum of space ' as a function of a discrete variable denoted @xmath42 ( see below ) . this has been achieved in @xcite ( which can be referred to also for a complete list of previous and related papers ) where the introduction of discrete , potential  like functions highlights the surprising crucial role of ` hidden ' symmetries , first discovered by regge @xcite for the @xmath23 symbols .",
    "the schrdinger equation is discretized with respect to a lattice variable given by the label of the operator @xmath43 which characterizes the first of the binary schemes in ( [ jbasis ] ) and reads @xmath44 where the matrix elements @xmath45 are expressed in terms of geometric quantities , namely @xmath46^{1/2}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath47 ^{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ ] is the heron s formula for the area of a triangle with side lengths @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus @xmath45 is proportional to the product of the areas of the two triangles sharing the side of length @xmath42 and forming a quadrilateral of sides @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "such a parameter quadrilateral , together with its regge  conjugate ( see below ) , is the guiding tool of the combinatorial and geometric analysis , in the asymptotic limit , of the hamiltonian dynamics governing both tetrahedral and ` fluttery ' quadrilateral configurations , see sections 2 and 3 of @xcite for more details .",
    "following @xcite , the quantum version of a classical dynamical algebra associated with a pair of ` mutually integrable ' dynamical variables calls into play a triple @xmath52 of linear operators acting on a ( suitably defined ) hilbert space with @xmath53 hermitian and algebraically independent and @xmath54 $ ] anti  hermitian . the request that these generators do fulfill the jacobi identity constrains the fundamental commutation relations to be of the form ( @xmath55 is the anticommutator ) @xmath56 & = \\ , k_3 \\\\ [ k_2,k_3 ] & = \\ , 2r\\,k_2k_1k_2 + a_1\\ , \\ { k_1,k_2\\ }",
    "+ a_2\\,k_2 ^ 2 + c_1\\,k_1 + d\\,k_2 + g_1\\\\ [ k_3,k_1 ] & = \\",
    ", 2r\\,k_1k_2 k_1 + a_1\\ , k_1 ^ 2 + a_2\\,\\ { k_1,k_2\\ } + c_2\\,k_2 + d\\,k_1 + g_2\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 are real parameters ( the structure constants ) and the right  hand sides of the last two relations contain only hermitian terms .",
    "such a kind of algebraic structures was actually introduced by sklyanin @xcite and they are called ` quadratic ' algebras for the obvious reason that the commutators ( poisson brackets in the classical cases ) are combinations of quadratic ( and linear ) terms in each of the generators .",
    "mutual integrability is a sharper requirement with respect to the original formulation , and amounts to look at the symmetry algebra as a dynamical one where @xmath58 is a constant of the motion for @xmath59 taken as the hamiltonian operator , as well as the other way around .",
    "further improvements in the the study of classical , quantum and @xmath60-deformed symmetries along these lines have been provided over the past few decades by a number of authors . often the admissible structures associated with and listed in the table below @xcite are referred to as ` zhedanov s algebras ' in the literature .",
    "note that for completeness the last line includes the two ` standard ' lie algebras on three generators ( whose commutation relations are by definition linear ) .",
    "+    * classification of quadratic algebras *    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparing the notations adopted here the bar stands for complex conjugation or simply transposition in the real cases with those of section [ algebra ] , it is straightforward to recognized that the classes * i * , * ii * and * iii * are in correspondence with the overlap functions in ( [ over1e2 ] ) , ( [ over1e3 ] ) and ( [ over2e3 ] ) ( restricted to finite sets by suitable choices of the omitted parameters ) , respectively .    looking at the family * ia * , observe that @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 by the convention chosen for @xmath23 symbols in ( [ seij ] ) ( and similarly for * ib * ) .",
    "thus ` self ",
    "duality ' relations for class * i * read either way @xmath66 once fulfilled the completeness relations @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath68 for the binary coupled eigenbases introduced in ( [ jbasis ] ) .",
    "note that the operators associated with class * i * ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) represent a ` leonard pair ' so that the associated overlap functions ( recoupling coefficients ) are necessarily hypergeometric of racah type @xcite .",
    "more generally , in connection with the analysis of the other classes , a stringent result holds true : any _ finite _ system of orthogonal polynomials whose dual is a finite system of orthogonal polynomials must be ( possibly @xmath60deformed ) racah or one of its limiting cases which constitute finite systems ( refer to @xcite for a modern monograph on hypergeometric polynomials in the askey ",
    "wilson scheme ) .",
    "indeed here all of the families are consistently defined , for fixed parameters @xmath72 , as finite sets ( recall the choice on the ordering discussed in connection with regge symmetry ) but the recognition of classes * ii * and * iii * as belonging to the askey scheme is certainly not straightforward .",
    "( more precisely , the reduction process to specific hypergeometric functions of type @xmath73 would require to find out a closed algebraic form for the sets of eigenvalues of the volume operator for given parameters , a task not yet accomplished . )    for what concerns duality within class * ii * , a first remark is about the bar operation : @xmath74 is @xmath75 , but the latter , unlike what happens for the @xmath23 , is not necessarily equal to @xmath76 because this property actually depends on the volume operator @xmath39 being hermitian ( imaginary antisymmetric ) @xcite or real symmetric ( see @xcite also for plots of the family of eigenfunctions @xmath77 ) .",
    "anyway , both options can be included through a suitable notation into the duality relations @xmath78 according to the choiche of the representation of @xmath39 .",
    "duality relations in class * iii * are similar to ( [ dualityii ] ) , with @xmath79 taking the role of @xmath42 .    to conclude this general overview on duality relationships , a further remarkable property transversal with respect to the classes has to be mentioned , namely @xmath80 such a ` triangular relation ' ( and the other ones that can be derived by using the properties of the single classes given above ) closely resembles the racah identity satisfied by three @xmath23 symbols and might be used also to explore a formalization of the whole subject within the general scheme of tensor categories .",
    "the issue of asymptotic ( semiclassical ) limits of angular momentum functions is of continuous interest in many fields , ranging from special function theory @xcite to applied quantum mechanics @xcite . here",
    "just a few remarks concerning two limiting cases of families * ii.a * and * iii.b * are sketched .",
    "the reference model of asymptotics is the well  know limit of the @xmath23 symbol for three large entries ( see @xcite ) , @xmath23 @xmath81 @xmath82 , where the latter is the wigner symbol , the symmetrized version of a clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficient .",
    "the counterpart of this operation in the askey scheme is achieved by moving one step downwards from top , namely from @xmath73 ( racah ) to @xmath83 ( hahn and dual hahn ) hypergeometric families .",
    "a new change of notation is needed which consists in restoring the string @xmath84 for the parameters ( see ( [ conv2 ] ) ) and in writing down as an array the functions in ( [ conv3 ] ) ( equivalently , in family * ii.a * ) according to @xmath85 where the vertical bars in front of the last column of this symbol indicate that not all of the entries are constrained by standard triangular inequalities , as happens for the @xmath23 . to address any limit",
    "in which ( some of ) the arguments of the symbols become large a fact that implies that all of the arguments can be ` running' a convenient notation is to substitute capital to small letters .",
    "thus the formal limiting process for the symbol in ( [ conv4 ] ) when the arguments of the lower row become large can be displayed as a generalized @xmath82 coefficient , denoted @xmath86 , related in turn to a generalized dual hahn polynomial ; schematically @xmath87 on applying a similar procedure to family * iii.b * , and denoting @xmath88 the previous generic argument @xmath79 ( playing the role of @xmath89 ) , the resulting correspondence would read @xmath90 a few comments on these results are in order , leaving aside a more careful analysis and most technical details reported in @xcite .",
    "as already noticed , the symbols in round brackets on the right  hand sides of ( [ limit1 ] ) and ( [ limit2 ] ) are generalized counterparts of @xmath82 coefficients , the arguments in the lower row being interpreted as magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "they actually share with standard @xmath82s a suitable formulation of regge symmetry @xcite and their properties as orthogonal families are inferred from three  term recursion relationships .",
    "the latter can in turn be derived as limits of the three ",
    "term recursions at the upper level ( in particular , the relation for ( [ limit1 ] ) can be quite easily worked out ) . the motivation for associating dual hahn and hahn families",
    "respectively is related with the specific lattices these three ",
    "term recursion relations are defined on .",
    "thus it is found that the relation for ( [ limit1 ] ) mimics the behavior of the relation of a @xmath82 on a quadratic lattice ( @xmath91 ) , so that it is functionally similar to the standard dual hahn polynomial family .",
    "conversely , the relation for ( [ limit2 ] ) mimics the behavior of the relation of a @xmath82 on a linear lattice ( given by scaling the quantum number @xmath92 ) and thus these functions represent counterparts of the hahn polynomial family .",
    "further developments can be addressed in parallel , from algebraic  analytical and geometric viewpoints .",
    "a schematic list of ongoing works ( and still open questions ) follows :    * improved interpretations of regge symmetries on the geometric ( _ scissor  congruent tetrahedra _",
    "@xcite ) and algebraic ( _ quaternionic reparametrization _",
    "@xcite ) sides ; * convolution rules for overlap functions ( specifically , symmetric recoupling coefficients ) of racah algebra ; * composition rules of collections of quadrilaterals able to provide new classes of integrable quantum systems to be associated with extended quantum geometries ; * @xmath60deformed extensions and limiting cases of the dual sets of orthogonal polynomials also in view of applications in quantum chemistry .",
    "in particular , a systematic study of limiting procedures to be carried out on recurrence relations , on families of polynomials and possibly directly on the defining relations ( [ commrel ] ) of the underlying quadratic algebras seems particularly promising also in view of recent analytical and numerical work on strictly related issues @xcite .",
