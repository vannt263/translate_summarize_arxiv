    "the recent observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the wmap @xcite and planck satellites  @xcite indicate that nature is simple and minimal , providing increasing evidence to favor single field inflationary models .    among the pioneering @xcite and newer models of inflation @xcite , starobinsky model  @xcite occupies a unique position , since it does not require any new field to drive inflation which we call the inflaton .",
    "its original version @xcite is based on a higher curvature action which emerges by incorporating matter loops to the einstein hilbert action . since all the second - order contributions of curvature tensors that affect the einstein equation in a conformally flat geometry including",
    "the robertson - walker spacetime can be adequately described by the square scalar curvature term , currently popular version of starobinsky model simply consists of linear and second - order terms of the ricci scalar @xmath12 @xcite .    in this model inflation",
    "is followed by an oscillatory behavior of the hubble parameter , which results in gravitational particle production to reheat the universe . making use of a conformal transformation",
    ", one can also recast the system to the einstein action containing a scalar field , dubbed as the scalaron acting as the inflaton , with a specific potential whose overall magnitude is determined by the coefficient of @xmath13 term in the original action  @xcite . in this picture reheating is described by the decay of the scalaron .",
    "various aspects of reheating after @xmath13 inflation have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite showed that dark matter and baryon asymmetry are produced at reheating by introducing majorana neutrinos .",
    "@xcite showed that parametric resonance is not strong enough to form long - living localized objects , and thus reheating proceeds through perturbative decay of the inflaton .",
    "the only adjustable parameter of starobinsky model , namely the coefficient of the curvature square term , can be fixed by the amplitude of curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "its spectral index @xmath14 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath15 have also been confronted with observations , and interestingly , this oldest inflation model occupies just the central region of their error ellipses @xcite .",
    "this feature was challenged this march by bicep2 collaboration  @xcite , which claimed to have detected b - mode polarization of cmb corresponding to a value of @xmath15 much larger than favored by these satellite based observations .",
    "it turned out later , however , that the contamination of foreground dust may be so significant that one can not rule out models with small @xmath15 yet at all  @xcite .",
    "thus the observational validity of starobinsky model is still intact .",
    "needless to say , on the other hand , occupying the central region of the likelihood contour does not necessarily mean the model is the right one , and we should continue our efforts to further clarify features of starobinsky model in the context of modern high energy theories , in particular , in supersymmetry ( susy ) which reduces the hierarchy problem significantly , naturally realizes gauge coupling unification , and provides cold dark matter candidates .    in the case of starobinsky model , which is a theory of gravity , susy actually means supergravity ( sugra )  @xcite .",
    "there are two minimal choices for the sugra multiplet : the old - minimal  @xcite and new - minimal  @xcite formulations .",
    "these two formulations utilize different sugra auxiliary fields , but they coincide on - shell for the standard sugra action , whose bosonic part is general relativity .",
    "this situation changes in the case of higher - derivative sugra , including sugra versions of starobinsky model , because these auxiliary fields become propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "embedding of the starobinsky action into the old - minimal sugra was studied at the linearized level in ref .",
    "@xcite and the non - linear level in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the duality to the standard sugra action with additional superfields was also established ( in analogy with the bosonic case  @xcite ) .",
    "tachyonic instability during the inflationary phase was cured in ref .",

    "@xcite and reconsidered in the inflationary context with higher order corrections in ricci scalar in ref .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite .    besides these pure sugra models without matter , there are many sugra models with matter that have starobinsky - like scalar potentials ( see , as an incomplete list , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , so it is of prime importance to distinguish these models by studying cosmological scenarios after inflation . to discuss reheating of the universe ,",
    "one has to couple the pure sugra inflation sector to matter sector .",
    "@xcite studied soft susy breaking pattern in the old - minimal case , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite discussed some features of matter - coupling in the new - minimal setup .    in this paper , we consider generic old - minimal sugra models  @xcite that realize starobinsky inflation focusing particularly on the model in ref .",
    "one of the reasons for the choice of the old - minimal formulation is that one has eventually to break r - symmetry to give gauginos their masses , but the new - minimal formulation has an exact r - symmetry .",
    "we assume the absence of even higher order terms in scalar curvature , corresponding to absence of superderivatives in the sugra action , because such terms may modify or hamper inflation @xcite .",
    "we introduce matter - coupling and study its cosmological consequences . in particular , we study various inflaton decay channels extensively .",
    "in contrast to the original non - susy version of reheating in the starobinsky model , there is a long - lived particle , gravitino .",
    "the gravitino is the superpartner of the graviton and hence always present in sugra , and its abundance is a cosmologically important subject .",
    "we thus study the partial decay rate into gravitinos , and resultant constraints on parameters of the theory .    before explaining our setup in section  [",
    "sec : setup ] , we briefly emphasize the differences from the literature . in our setup , as we will see , the inflaton must have specific super- and khler potentials .",
    "for example , the exponential of khler potential _",
    "linearly _ depends on the real part of the inflaton , while the gauge kinetic function never depends on the inflaton .",
    "our setup , the old - minimal sugra realization of the starobinsky model , is thus predictive . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "this is an interesting possibility because the higher derivative version of the purely supergravitational theory describes not only the inflation but also susy breaking .",
    "however , the susy breaking scale becomes the inflation scale ( @xmath67 gev ) , which typically makes the higgs particle too heavy  @xcite .",
    "although the tree - level contributions to soft susy breaking parameters can be suppressed by assuming a minimal coupling between the mssm sector and the sugra sector as in our setup , there are anomaly - mediated contributions to gaugino masses , which in turn give other particles their masses through renormalization group running .    therefore , we concentrate on models that deviate ( if any ) only slightly from the simple model , . for definiteness , we assume @xmath68 and @xmath69 are at most of order the gravitino mass @xmath70 , which is supposed to be much smaller than the inflaton mass , @xmath71 .",
