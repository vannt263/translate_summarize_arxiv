    "sbs  0335 - 052 ( izotov et al . 1990 ) is a blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy that , at an abundance of @xmath5 ( melnick et al .",
    "1992 , izotov et al .",
    "1997 ) , is the second lowest metallicity galaxy known after i  zw  18 .",
    "sbs  0335 - 052 hosts an exceptionally powerful episode of star formation , and thuan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed , on the basis of hst observations , that the present burst is possibly the first star - forming episode in the history of the galaxy .",
    "the same authors deduce that the star formation occurs in six super - star clusters ( sscs ) not older than 25 myr and located within a region smaller than 2 , or 520 pc at a distance of 54.3 mpc that we will assume in this paper ( @xmath6km / s , see izotov et al .",
    "though the presence of dust mixed with the star forming clusters is evident from the hst images , the iso observation by thuan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) of a very strong continuum at @xmath7 m was a surprise .",
    "this was successfully modeled with a modified black body and a screen extinction of @xmath8 , and interpreted as due to thermal emission by silicate dust ( m@xmath9 ) warmed by embedded clusters of star formation completely invisible in the optical .    because of the lack of chemical enrichment , low - metallicity bcds such as sbs  0335 - 052 are also hypothetical candidates for young or primeval galaxies ( pgs ) undergoing their first burst of star formation .",
    "while the majority of bcds show an underlying extended low - surface - brightness component with colors indicative of an intermediate - age or old stellar population ( loose & thuan 1985 ; kunth et al .",
    "1988 ; papaderos et al . 1996 ; telles & terlevich 1997 ) , there is still debate whether such a component has been detected in the two most metal - deficient bcds presently known , izw18 ( z@xmath10/50 , searle & sargent 1972 ) and sbs 0335052 .",
    "high - resolution hst optical images of izw18 ( hunter & thronson 1995 ) show colors of the underlying diffuse component consistent with a sea of unresolved b or early a stars , with no evidence for stars older than a few tens of myr , although aloisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and stlin ( 2000 ) have claimed to detect a 1 - 4 gyr stellar population in that bcd .",
    "similar observations of sbs0335 - 052 ( thuan et al . 1997 ) show colors much bluer than those expected for such an intermediate - age stellar population .",
    "the optical evidence is only suggestive , however , since a large fraction of the extended emission in sbs0335 - 052 is of gaseous origin ( thuan et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "near - infrared ( nir ) colors can help resolve the age question , since they are extremely effective indicators of stellar population age , _ given the metallicity_. while nir colors of _ evolved _ stellar populations vary little ( griersmith et al . 1982 ; frogel 1985 ; giovanardi & hunt 1988 , 1996 ) , recent evolutionary synthesis models ( leitherer et al .",
    "sb99 ; krger et al .",
    "1995 ) show that the nir colors of _ young _ stellar populations differ significantly from those of older ones .",
    "both models find that longward of 1@xmath11 m , the nebular continuum dominates the emission during the early phases ( a few myr ) of the starburst .",
    "therefore nir colors provide a unique and effective diagnostic , and when combined with optical colors , are good indicators of stellar population age .",
    "nir spectroscopy has a three - fold importance for our analysis .",
    "first , it enables the estimate of the nebular contribution to the emission in order to decontaminate the broadband colors .",
    "second , it is an almost extinction - free probe of the starburst parameters in what are typically dusty environments .",
    "finally , it offers unique constraints on the star - formation history of the galaxy .",
    "in particular the equivalent width of @xmath12 is possibly the best age indicator for young starbursts since it measures the ratio between young blue massive stars and the evolved red stellar population .",
    "the nir co absorption features are the strongest signature of cold evolved stars , as are the he ricombination lines for hot massive stars , and [ feii ] for supernova remnants .",
    "finally the infrared is the only spectral region where the molecular gas can be detected in its warm phase through @xmath13 emission lines .",
    "it is therefore of crucial importance to further investigate sbs  0335 - 052 in the near - infrared to study the stellar populations in this extremely low - metallicity system , as well as investigate the putative hidden star formation suggested by the large extinction derived from the mid - infrared spectral energy distribution . with this aim",
    "we have obtained nir spectra in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , and broadband images in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we present here the results of our new observations .",
    "the sbs0335 - 052 system consists of two widely separated ( 22kpc in the east - west direction ) star - forming components within a large 64@xmath1421kpc hi cloud ( pustilnik et al .",
    "we denote the eastern component by sbs0335 - 052 , and the western one ( lipovetsky et al .",
    "1999 ) by sbs0335 - 052w .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we present our data along with a description of the observations and data reduction .",
    "sect.3 is a description of the nir spectrum and of the properties of the galaxy as can be derived from the analysis of the spectrum .",
    "the same is done in sect.4 for the near - infrared images .",
    "the characteristics of the galaxy derived from the observations are combined with data from the literature , and then used to constrain a starburst model in sect.5 . in sect.6",
    "we summarize the results of our work .",
    "our data were acquired at eso , la silla , with the ntt and sofi , and at ukirt , mauna kea , with ircam3 .",
    "the former camera@xmath15spectrometer is based on a 1024@xmath141024 hawaii hgcdte array , and the latter camera on a 256@xmath14256 nicmos3 .",
    "low - resolution ( r=600 ) spectra of sbs  0335 - 052 covering the @xmath1 and @xmath2 infrared bands were obtained with sofi at the ntt in two different occasions : first in august 1998 with 45 m of integration , and later in december 1998 with similar conditions and the same amount of integration time . in both cases we used a slit 1  wide ( 5  arcmin length ) oriented along the `` major axis '' of the galaxy @xmath16 .",
    "since the source is much smaller than the length of the slit , the nod - on - slit technique was used to acquire the sky spectrum .",
    "the data reduction followed the standard process of flat - fielding and sky - subtraction .",
    "a lamp spectrum was used to correct the 2d spectra for distortions along the slit , and to have an accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "1d spectra were extracted with an aperture of 15 centered on the brightest peak .",
    "particular attention was given to achieving a good estimate of the continuum slope .",
    "the 1d spectra were divided by the spectrum of a solar - type star observed under the same conditions to correct for the telluric absorption features .",
    "then the solar spectrum was used to reestablish the original slope as described by maiolino et al .",
    "the two spectra have been averaged with equal weights .",
    "the spectrum was flux calibrated extracting the photometry from the corresponding apertures in our h and k images .",
    "this also lead to the adjustment of the continuum that was otherwise too blue .",
    "comparison of the spectrum with the photometric values was always done by convolving the spectrum with the filter bandpass measured in the laboratory .",
    "the 1d combined spectrum flux and wavelength calibrated is shown in fig .",

    "( r=1400 ) spectrum in the @xmath3 band was observed with sofi in october 1999 under exceptional seeing conditions ( 05 average of the night ) ; the total integration time was in this case 1h .",
    "we used the same slit and same pa as in the observations described above , and the same procedure was used for the data reduction . at this spatial resolution ,",
    "two peaks of emission separated by about 15 were clearly resolved in the 2d spectrum .",
    "two 1d spectra centered on the two peaks were extracted with apertures of 08 ( south - east ) and 06 ( north - west ) .",
    "we will refer to these spectra as a and b respectively in the rest of the paper . since the observed band is well transmitted by the atmosphere no correction or readjustment of the slope was applied .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated extracting the photometry from the corresponding apertures in the 0073@xmath17 image ( see next section ) . the flux- and wavelength - calibrated spectra are shown in fig.[higres ] .",
    "all the spectra have been smoothed to lower resolution to reduce the noise .    including the errors on the photometry , centering and size of the apertures the flux calibration of the spectra",
    "can be estimated to be accurate within 10% .",
    "we acquired @xmath0 ( 1.2@xmath11 m ) , @xmath1 ( 1.6@xmath11 m ) , and @xmath2 ( 2.2 @xmath11 m ) images of the nominal central ( e ) and western ( w ) component of sbs0335 - 052 with the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) equipped with ircam3 .",
    "the plate scale is 028 , with a total field - of - view of 72 ; the e and w components are separated by roughly 84 , too large to be accommodated by the ircam3 field - of - view , so we performed separate sets of observations for the two components .",
    "the source was placed in several different positions on the array , taking care not to compromise the flat field by having overlap in the source positions . at the beginning of each observing sequence",
    ", dark exposures were acquired with the same parameters as the subsequent science frames .",
    "total on - source integration times were 55min and 48min in @xmath2 for the e and w components , respectively ; 30 and 34min in @xmath1 ; and 19 and 27min in @xmath0 .",
    "individual frames were dark - subtracted and flat - fielded with a subset of the remaining frames in the sequence , after editing them for stars ( to avoid `` holes '' in the reduced frames ) .",
    "the reduced frames were then registered and averaged ; observations obtained on different nights were combined with a similar algorithm , but with the flux scale given by the relative photometric calibration , and weighted by the total integration time .",
    "photometric calibration was performed by observing standard stars , every few hours , from the ukirt faint standard list . as for the source observations ,",
    "each standard was measured in several different positions on the array .",
    "we corrected for atmospheric extinction by fitting simultaneously , for each band , an extinction coefficient common to all nights and a `` zero point '' that varied from night to night .",
    "the resulting extinction coefficients are 0.049 , 0 , and 0.046 mag / airmass in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "formal photometric accuracy , as judged by the nightly dispersion of the standard stars is 0.025mag , or better , in all three bands . we have corrected all photometry for galactic extinction ( @xmath18  mag ) using the extinction law of cardelli et al . (",

    "three images were also acquired in october 1999 with sofi at the ntt . a @xmath0 image with a scale of 0.146 arcsec / pix and a total integration of 300 sec , a @xmath3 image with the same scale and integration time and a @xmath3 image with a scale of 0073 /pixel and integration time of 400 sec .",

    "the figure shows , at a significantly higher resolution and better seeing than fig .",
    "[ kimg_uk ] , the same central structure as seen in the visible and in the deeper ukirt image .",
    "the lack of extended structure in the high - resolution image is due to its lower sensitivity .",
    ".recombination lines in sbs  0335 - 052 from the low - resolution spectrum , @xmath27 in @xmath11 m and fluxes measured in 10@xmath28erg / s / cm@xmath21 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath30 and @xmath31 colors of the region extended to the northwest beyond sscs 4 + 5 in the eastern source ( see fig .",
    "[ vmijvk ] ) seem to imply a young age similar to that estimated for the sscs , but with an excess in @xmath2 .",
    "although such an excess could be imputed to our relatively low sensitivity in @xmath2 to the blue colors observed in sbs  0335 - 052 , we find a @xmath321.3 , even in relatively high surface brightness regions where our deep ukirt @xmath2 image is sufficiently sensitive .",
    "the @xmath4 colors of the extended region ( nw ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ jmhhmk ] are very red , and @xmath33 is blue ; the red @xmath4 is an indication that there may be hot dust also in the extended region .",
    "we can estimate what fraction of an evolved stellar population could be present in sbs  0335 - 052 , given the observed nir colors .",
    "the nir is the best spectral region to perform this estimate , since it is more sensitive than the optical to evolved stars .",
    "first , we find absolutely no color evidence for an evolved stellar population ( age greater than 10myr ) in any of the regions examined , including the diffuse low - surface - brightness component .",
    "hence , the fraction of  hidden \" evolved stars that could be present is essentially dictated by the uncertainties on our nir colors . in the sscs and the global colors , these are nominally around 0.07  mag , since each magnitude has an uncertainty of roughly 0.05  mag or better , including calibration errors .",
    "therefore , by adding the colors of an evolved ( @xmath34  1gyr ) to the 3  myr sb99 color , we can estimate what fraction of an evolved stellar population would be responsible for a color change in @xmath33 and @xmath4 that is equivalent to our measurement uncertainty .",
    "it turns out that @xmath33 changes by around 0.07  mag for a 1618% contribution of an evolved population to the 3  myr sb99 color ; the concomitant @xmath4 color change is smaller ( 0.03  mag ) . because we are observing the _ total _ colors , the fraction becomes @xmath35 or 15% ; that is to say we can not exclude a 15% or smaller contribution to the nir colors ( of the sscs or globally ) that derives from an evolved stellar population .",
    "this upper limit is unchanged if we add evolved nir colors to a 3  myr solar - abundance stellar population ( sb99 ) , rather than to a metal - poor one .",
    "we are also interested in the fraction of evolved stars that could be present in the diffuse region that extends to the northwest . as shown in fig .",
    "[ jmhhmk ] , the uncertainties there are larger than those in the sscs .",
    "if we take an error of 0.25  mag in @xmath33 , we derive a ratio of 0.9 between evolved and young stellar population colors .",
    "this implies that 47% of the extended emission could derive from an evolved population , given the @xmath33 uncertainties in the extended region .",
    "however , the @xmath33 colors are not the whole story .",
    "we find an @xmath4 color of @xmath36 in the outer regions , whether we use the integrated profiles or the photometry of the color images to measure it .",
    "such a red color is not reproducible by adding an evolved stellar population to the 3  myr nir colors ; indeed , the @xmath37 color of an evolved stellar population is _ bluer _ than that of stars@xmath15gas at 3  myr .",
    "it is difficult to imagine a scenario involving a significant evolved stellar population in which the colors are conveniently uncertain in @xmath33 , but provide such a red @xmath4 .      to investigate the hot dust that we have tentatively invoked to explain the red @xmath4 colors , we have combined the mid - infrared iso spectrum of sbs  0335 - 052 ( thuan et al . 1999 ) with the @xmath2-band emission after accounting for the observed gas fraction .",
    "after subtracting the gas contribution , we have assumed that half of the remaining @xmath2 band flux is due to hot dust .",
    "the combined sed has been fitted with two modified blackbodies at different temperatures and a foreground dust screen .",
    "dust temperatures and amplitudes , dust emissivity index , and visual extinction @xmath38 were left as free parameters , and we have adopted the extinction curve given in draine ( 1989 ) .    the resulting fit is shown in fig . [ dust ] as a dotted line .",
    "the warm and hot components have temperatures of 226  k and 668  k , the cooler temperature being similar to 260  k found by thuan et al .",
    "the fitted emissivity is around @xmath39 ( instead of the @xmath40 used by thuan et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the amplitude of the hotter component is 9% that of the cooler one at 10@xmath11 m . at shorter wavelengths , the ratio of the hotter to the cooler component increases , being 31% at 7.7@xmath11 m and 68% at 6.7@xmath11 m .",
    "the fitted extinction @xmath38 is around 12  mag , but more uncertain ( @xmath411  mag ) than the temperatures ( uncertainties @xmath4110  k ) . in any case , without a significant extinction , the sed is very poorly fit as it is too narrow around its peak at 10  @xmath11 m . with two dust components ,",
    "we find a slightly lower temperature ( for the cooler dust ) and lower extinction than the @xmath38 of 21  mag found by thuan et al .",
    "nevertheless , both models show that the mid - infrared extinction is high , in variance with what we infer from the optical / nir recombination lines .",
    "the most likely explanation is the clumpy nature of the interstellar medium , since we do not detect peaks of emission at 2@xmath11 m corresponding to hidden sscs .",
    "there may be a relatively high quantity of dust globally , but not locally in the vicinity of the sscs we detect .",
    "the fit of the mid - infrared spectrum around 10  @xmath11 m is poor in detail because the draine extinction curve overpredicts silicate absorption there ( lutz et al .",
    "1996 ) , and indeed fits of the sed in sbs  0335 - 052 with the galactic center curve give better results ( thuan et al .",
    "however , it is clear that a hot - dust component can fit the shorter - wavelength points very well , and consistently with the @xmath2 emission after gas subtraction .",
    "indeed , such dust seems to be necessary to explain the red @xmath4 colors of sbs  0335 - 052 .",
    "we can summarize the results of our work as follows :    1 .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum of sbs  0335 - 052 is representative of an extreme and young starburst galaxy .",
    "the @xmath12 equivalent width indicates a very young age , and is one of the largest ever observed in an extragalactic object .",
    "the he i recombination lines support the presence of young massive stars .",
    "recombination and @xmath13 lines are strong , [ feii ] and stellar absorption bands are absent , which also implies a strong uv field and a young stellar population ; there is no spectroscopic evidence for stars older than 56  myr .",
    "modeling the @xmath12 and @xmath2 continuum leads to a burst age@xmath425 myr and a star formation rate that can be as high as 10 @xmath43/yr .",
    "the spatial profile of the @xmath2 continuum is shifted by about 60 pc northwest of the emission line peak and it is much closer to it than the optical peak at a distance of 200 pc .",
    "this is explained with the dominant nebular contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "all optical and nir emission lines coincide and have consistent spatial profiles .",
    "the near - infrared photometry of sbs  0335 - 052 is highly contaminated by nebular emission .",
    "the optical and nir colors are unusual , and after correction for the gas contribution can be only understood as due to a stellar population not older than 4 myr , together with hot dust at 670  k. 4 .   on the basis of the nir colors , the stellar population in sbs  0335 - 052w appears to be older than that in sbs  0335 - 052 ; the colors are redder in @xmath33 and bluer in @xmath4 and correspond to an approximate age of 1020  myr according to sb99 . however , optical recombination line equivalent widths suggest that the stellar population can not be older than 10  myr , and our models suggest that the age is more likely around 57  myr . 5 .",
    "the gas - corrected spectrum from 2 to 17@xmath11 m is well fit by two thermal components ( hot dust at 670  k , and cooler dust at 225  k ) , together with @xmath44mag of visual extinction in a foreground screen .",
    "we do not find evidence at 2@xmath11 m for optically hidden star formation .",
    "judging from the uncertainties on the nir photometry , the possible contribution from an evolved stellar population in sbs  0335 - 052 can not exceed 15% .    sbs  0335 - 052 appears to be an unusual object , as there is no evidence , even in the near - infrared , for an evolved stellar population deriving from an earlier burst .",
    "this is in contrast to results for the lowest - metallicity galaxy known , i  zw  18 , in which aloisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and stlin ( 2000 ) claimed to detect a 14 gyr underlying stellar population .",
    "if the star - formation rates derived from our modeling are representative , then stars are forming in sbs  0335 - 052 extremely rapidly , but how such a rate is connected to the formation of sscs is an open question .",
    "it could be that under certain conditions , star formation , galaxy gas consumption , and evolution proceed very quickly , while in others , evolution is slower .",
    "future work will be aimed at better quantifying what these conditions might be , and how they relate to metallicity .",
