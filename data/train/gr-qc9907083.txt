    "<S> i wish to address this issue here .    </S>",
    "<S> the role of the scalar field may be easily clarified using the method of consistent potentials ( mcp ) originally due to grubisi and moncrief @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mcp has been applied to a variety of cosmological spacetimes to explain the nature of the ( numerically observed ) approach to the singularity in spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mcp first assumes that the approach to the singularity is asymptotically velocity term dominated ( avtd ) @xcite and then looks for a contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> if the model is avtd , it approaches arbitrarily closely to a kasner solution with a possibly different kasner solution at every spatial point . for any model , an asymptotic velocity term dominated ( vtd ) solution may be found by neglecting all terms in einstein s equations containing spatial derivatives and taking the limit as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the mcp includes the implicit assumption that strong cosmic censorship holds for these cosmological models  i.e.  there exists a foliation labeled by @xmath2 such that some curvature invariant blows up as @xmath3 . ) </S>",
    "<S> if the model is actually avtd , then substitution of the vtd solution into the full einstein equations will be consistent  asymptotically , all terms neglected in obtaining the vtd solution will be exponentially small . for convenience </S>",
    "<S> , the mcp will be applied to the hamiltonian whose variation yields the relevant einstein equations since exponentially small ( growing ) terms in the hamiltonian will yield exponentially small ( growing ) terms in einstein s equations upon variation . </S>",
    "<S> any terms which can not be made consistent with the vtd solution indicate , within the mcp , that the model is not avtd . here </S>",

    "<S> we see , then , that the main function of the scalar field is to weaken the restriction imposed by the hamiltonian constraint on the gravitational `` kinetic energy . '' in fig .  1 , </S>",

    "<S> the trajectory must fall on the `` kasner circle '' defined by @xmath47 . for a small initial value of @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , the non - vacuum model closely tracks the other until the amplitude of @xmath55 grows sufficiently large . at this point , </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory deviates noticeably from the kasner circle . </S>",
    "<S> shortly thereafter , @xmath33 are able to satisfy ( [ vrestrix ] ) so there are no more bounces and the values of @xmath33 no longer change . </S>",
    "<S> ( this causes the trajectory in the @xmath33-plane to end . )    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to retain the mixmaster ( oscillatory ) behavior if @xmath17 in ( [ hix ] ) is such that @xmath56 where @xmath57 . a potential of this type will , according to the mcp , yield an exponentially growing term in ( [ hixv ] ) unless @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> but @xmath58 means that the usual mixmaster oscillations will occur . </S>",

    "<S> the appropriate generalization of ( [ bpmix ] ) is required . </S>",
    "<S> this is found by solving the velocity term dominated ( vtd ) equations obtained by neglecting all terms in einstein s equations containing spatial derivatives . in the limit as @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are functions of @xmath66 and @xmath67 but independent of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the sign of @xmath81 is fixed to ensure collapse . ) in the @xmath82 limit , the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hu1 ] ) becomes @xmath83 to obtain this expression , it was necessary to assume @xmath84 and @xmath85 so that the exponential terms containing @xmath86 and @xmath87 in @xmath88 would be exponentially small . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath84 causes the term @xmath89 in ( [ hu1 ] ) to grow unless @xmath90 this condition is obtained by noting that @xmath85 implies @xmath91 as @xmath1 so that @xmath92 from ( [ eab ] ) behaves as @xmath93 . as was shown in @xcite , the vtd form of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hkvtdu1 ] ) gives @xmath94 so that ( [ vcondition ] ) can not be satisfied with @xmath84 and @xmath85 . on the other hand , if either of these is @xmath95 , either @xmath96 or @xmath97 in ( [ hu1 ] ) will grow . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the prediciton ( observed numerically ) that the approach to the singularity is oscillatory .    </S>",
    "<S> just as in the spatially homogeneous case , in the presence of a scalar field @xmath98 , the avtd limit of the hamiltonian constraint becomes @xmath99 where @xmath12 is the scalar field momentum . </S>",
    "<S> it is now possible to simultaneously satisfy @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath100 since @xmath101 from ( [ hkvtdu1phi ] ) can be made arbitrarily large with a sufficiently strong scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> at any representative spatial point , after some number of oscillations , the momenta will move into the range needed to make the remaining evolution avtd at that point . </S>",
    "<S> presumably , as @xmath1 , the model will become avtd almost everywhere .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to display this effect in a computer simulation of the full einstein equations for @xmath62 symmetric cosmologies with and without a scalar field . for convenience </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath12 is chosen to be constant in space . in fig .  2 , the evolution of @xmath102 toward the singularity at three representative spatial points is shown for both cases . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the scalar field suppresses the oscillations . in fig .  3 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath103 is shown for both cases . </S>",
    "<S> note that the formation of ever smaller scale spatial structure is suppressed by the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> although these particular simulations can only be followed to @xmath104 , the mcp predicts that , for the scalar field model , at the spatial points of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a and 2b , since @xmath105 ( to machine accuracy ) and @xmath84 respectively , no further bounces will occur . at the spatial point of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2c , at least one more bounce to change the sign of @xmath74 is expected .    in models with two commuting spatial killing fields , the hamiltonian constraint enters in an interesting way . consider the magnetic gowdy model discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its variables @xmath106 and conjugate momenta @xmath107 depend on spatial coordinate @xmath40 and time @xmath2 . here , einstein s equations are obtained by variation of a hamiltonian @xmath108 which is _ not _ the hamiltonian constraint @xmath109 . </S>",

    "<S> the avtd solution obtained from the variation of ( [ hmaggowdy ] ) neglecting spatial derivatives is @xmath114 where @xmath115 depends on @xmath40 but not on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as was described in @xcite , substitution of ( [ gowdyavtd ] ) into ( [ hmaggowdy ] ) shows that @xmath116 will grow if @xmath117 , @xmath118 will grow if @xmath119 while @xmath120 will grow if @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is no value of @xmath67 consistent with the avtd solution ( [ gowdyavtd ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now consider a scalar field with momentum @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lamdot ] ) for @xmath123 gains an additional term and becomes @xmath124 so that the avtd solution is ( since the equations for @xmath125 and @xmath126 remain the same ) @xmath127 where @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic potential will now grow if @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> the additional scalar field kinetic energy means that we can have @xmath121 needed to keep @xmath130 and @xmath131 small with @xmath132 as is needed to keep @xmath133 small . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is expected that , eventually , oscillations will cease as @xmath67 and @xmath55 enter the required ranges at almost every spatial point .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of numerical simulations of the magnetic gowdy models ( on @xmath63 rather than the solv - twisted torus @xcite ) with and without a scalar field are shown in figures 4 and 5 . in the former , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution toward the singularity of @xmath125 at three typical spatial points is shown . </S>",
    "<S> for the scalar field model , @xmath134 at all the spatial points so that no further oscillations are expected . once again , the scalar field is seen to suppress the bounces and the growth of small - scale spatial structure . </S>",
    "<S> the entire evolution @xmath135 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the initial amplitude of @xmath122 , the more quickly the bounces will be suppressed .    as in the spatially homogeneous case , the inhomogeneous models should continue to oscillate for scalar field potentials with an exponential form as in([vscalarexp ] ) almost everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> although the mechanism described here has been examined only in particular systems using arguments based on the mcp approximation ( reinforced by numerical simulations of the full equations ) , we expect the behavior discussed here to be valid generically . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom line is that the scalar field kinetic energy relaxes the restrictions imposed by the hamiltonian constraint on the gravitational kinetic energy . since it is these restrictions which lead to the mixmaster oscillations , relaxing them will allow an avtd approach to the singularity </S>"
