    "vacuum decay by quantum tunneling in curved spacetime was first studied more than thirty years ago by coleman and de luccia ( cdl )  @xcite , using a formalism based on bounce solutions of the euclidean field equations . in recent years",
    "there has been renewed interest in this topic , motivated in part by its relevance for a possible string landscape .",
    "this has uncovered new aspects of the problem that become significant if the mass scales approach the planck mass or the bounce radius approaches the horizon length .",
    "it was assumed in  @xcite that the dominant bounce solution had an o(4 ) symmetry ; we will refer to such solutions as cdl bounces . in this paper",
    "we will investigate a different class of solutions , with an @xmath2 symmetry , that can occur when the tunneling is from a de sitter spacetime .",
    "our motivation for studying these is two - fold . for the case of tunneling in",
    "flat spacetime at zero temperature it has been shown that the bounce with minimum action in a theory with a single scalar field has an o(4 ) symmetry , and it is generally believed that this result extends to theories involving more fields . indeed , it is quite possible that all bounce solutions in these theories are o(4)-symmetric .",
    "no proof of a comparable result in curved spacetime has ever been obtained . the @xmath2 symmetry that we impose ( which would not be possible in flat spacetime at zero temperature ) reduces the field equations for the bounce to a set of ordinary differential equations , thus making the problem quite tractable and allowing comparison of the actions of the two types of bounces .",
    "a second motivation is that these solutions shed light on a reinterpretation of the cdl prescription that was advocated recently by brown and one of us  @xcite .",
    "it was argued there that in the case of decay from a de sitter vacuum the bounce should be understood as describing tunneling in a finite horizon volume at finite temperature .",
    "this has implications for extracting from the bounce the configuration immediately after tunneling .",
    "the cdl bounce is topologically a four - sphere , and it is commonly asserted that the configuration after tunneling is obtained from the three - sphere lying on the `` equator '' of the bounce . by contrast , it was argued in ref .  @xcite that half of this three - sphere gives the configuration within the horizon volume after tunneling , with the other half giving the configuration before tunneling .",
    "the fields beyond the horizon , either before or after tunneling , are never specified and do not enter the calculation . for cdl bounces corresponding to vacuum bubbles",
    "much less than horizon size there is little practical difference between the two interpretations .",
    "the differences become significant as the bubble approaches horizon size and , especially , in the hawking - moss  @xcite limit . for the bounces",
    "we consider , the differences in interpretation are manifest for all bubble sizes . from the viewpoint of ref .",
    "@xcite these bounces correspond to thermal production of a single bubble , whereas the conventional viewpoint would yield the somewhat surprising conclusion that a pair of bubbles had been produced .",
    "our interest in this these bounces was first raised by the work of garriga and megevand  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the analogy with the thermal production of bubbles in flat spacetime , they studied bounces with @xmath2 symmetry and , indeed , did interpret these as corresponding to the nucleation of a pair of bubbles .",
    "the discussion was originally in the context of brane nucleation  @xcite , in which the bubble walls are closed 2-branes , but their analysis can also be applied to field theory nucleation in the thin - wall approximation .",
    "we will differ from them in not restricting ourselves to this thin - wall limit .",
    "in fact , we will see that the thin - wall approximation inevitably breaks down when the bubble becomes sufficiently large , in what is perhaps the most interesting limit of these solutions .",
    "we work in the context of a scalar field theory with lagrangian @xmath3 where @xmath4 has two local minima , with the higher ( lower ) being termed the false ( true ) vacuum .",
    "we assume that both minima have positive energy , and are thus de sitter spacetimes .",
    "although our focus is on the nucleation of a true vacuum bubble in a false vacuum background , we also consider the nucleation of a bubble of false vacuum within a de sitter true vacuum background .",
    "although this process is energetically forbidden in the absence of gravity , it can occur in de sitter spacetime with its nonzero temperature @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the cdl case , the bounces governing the nucleation of true vacuum and false vacuum bubbles are not identical .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the essentials of vacuum tunneling , focusing on some features of particular relevance here . in sec .",
    "iii , we set up the formalism that we will use , and obtain some basic results concerning our solutions . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the application of the thin - wall approximation to our problem , explaining how its applicability is more limited than in the case of bounces with o(4 ) symmetry .",
    "we then turn to the description of the @xmath2-symmetric bounces themselves .",
    "some limiting cases that can be handled analytically are discussed in sec .",
    "v , and in sec .",
    "vi we describe the results of our numerical solutions . section  vii contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in flat spacetime at zero temperature , vacuum decay occurs through the production of bubbles of true vacuum via quantum tunneling .",
    "importantly , this is not a tunneling process from homogeneous false vacuum to homogeneous true vacuum , but rather tunneling from an initial configuration that is pure false vacuum to a final configuration containing a bubble of true vacuum ( or an approximation thereof ) within a false vacuum background .",
    "the tunneling is not actually through the one - dimensional barrier that appears in a plot of @xmath4 , but rather through an infinite - dimensional barrier in configuration space defined by the potential energy functional @xmath6 = \\int d^3x \\left[\\frac12 ( { \\bm \\nabla}_\\mu \\phi)^2 + v(\\phi )                \\right ]    \\ , .\\ ] ]    one approach to this problem is via the wkb method . with one degree of freedom , @xmath7",
    ", the wkb approximation gives an amplitude for tunneling through a barrier that is proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is of the form @xmath10 } \\ ] ] with @xmath11 .",
    "for a barrier in a multidimensional configuration space , one must find a path through the barrier for which the corresponding one - dimensional tunneling exponent @xmath9 is a local minimum  @xcite .",
    "coleman  @xcite showed that the problem of finding a stationary point of @xmath9 is equivalent to finding a `` bounce '' solution of the euclidean equations of motion . in the field theory case ,",
    "the bounce is a solution @xmath12 in four - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the hypersurface at the initial value @xmath13 ( which is equal to @xmath14 for tunneling from the false vacuum ) gives the configuration before tunneling , while the configuration @xmath15 along the hypersurface through the center of the bounce gives the optimal exit point from the potential energy barrier ; i.e. , the form of the bubble at nucleation . the hypersurfaces at intermediate euclidean times @xmath16 give successive configurations along the optimal tunneling path .",
    "those for @xmath17 are simply mirror images of those for negative @xmath18 , thus motivating the term `` bounce '' .",
    "the bubble nucleation rate per unit volume is of the form @xmath19 , with @xmath9 being equal to the difference of the euclidean actions of the bounce and the pure false vacuum .",
    "subject to only mild assumptions on the potential  @xcite , the bounce of minimum action can be shown to have an o(4 ) symmetry .",
    "this bounce has a central region , in which @xmath20 is close to its true vacuum value , within an infinite region of false vacuum , with the two regions separated by a wall of finite thickness in which @xmath20 traverses the potential barrier , as shown in fig .",
    "[ flat - bounce - sliced ] .",
    "that trace out a path in configuration space .",
    "the lower heavy dashed line ( corresponding to @xmath21 ) indicates the initial pure false vacuum state , while the heavy dashed line through the center of the bounce corresponds to the field configuration at bubble nucleation.,height=240 ]    an alternative approach is to use a euclidean path integral to calculate the imaginary part of the energy of the false vacuum , which is closely related to @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "this gives the prefactor @xmath23 in terms of the eigenvalues of small fluctuations about the bounce , with the imaginary part of the energy emerging from the presence of a single negative eigenvalue .",
    "if there are additional negative eigenvalues , the path specified by the bounce is not even a local minimum of @xmath9 , but rather a saddle point , and the bounce solution must be discarded  @xcite .",
    "both the wkb and the path integral approaches show that tunneling at a nonzero temperature @xmath24 is governed by a bounce solution that is periodic in imaginary time with period @xmath25 .",
    "two types of periodic bounces can be distinguished .    at low temperature",
    "the bounce is a somewhat deformed and elongated version of the zero - temperature bounce , with the o(4 ) symmetry reduced to an o(3 ) symmetry .",
    "such bounces correspond to thermally assisted tunneling processes in which thermal effects allow the system to start the tunneling at a somewhat higher point on the potential energy barrier . at sufficiently high temperatures",
    "this solution may cease to exist .",
    "the second type of solution corresponds to a thermal fluctuation to a saddle point at the top of a `` mountain pass '' over the potential energy barrier .",
    "these solutions are independent of @xmath18 .",
    "each three - dimensional spatial slice is infinite in extent and describes an o(3)-symmetric configuration @xmath26 with a central true vacuum bubble of critical size .",
    "the euclidean action of these solutions is equal to the energy of this critical bubble divided by the temperature .",
    "although these solutions exist for all values of @xmath24 , at low temperature they have multiple negative modes and must therefore be discarded . because this point will be important for us later , let us examine it a bit more closely .    a critical bubble solution",
    "@xmath26 is a saddle point of the potential energy functional @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the second variation of @xmath28 has a single negative mode @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30 with @xmath31 . the second variation of the euclidean action , @xmath32 must then have a spectrum that includes eigenmodes of the form @xmath33 and @xmath34 with eigenvalues @xmath35 hence , at temperatures @xmath36 there are multiple negative modes , and the @xmath18-independent bounce must be discarded . in the flat spacetime thin - wall approximation with a critical bubble of radius @xmath37",
    "one finds that @xmath38 .",
    "more generally , we expect that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a characteristic length scale of the critical bubble solution .",
    "thus , we must require that @xmath41      coleman and de luccia proposed  @xcite that the effects of gravity on bubble nucleation could be obtained by including a curvature term in the euclidean action and seeking a bounce solution that satisfies the coupled euclidean einstein and matter equations .",
    "if one assumes that the bounce has an o(4 ) symmetry , and @xmath4 is everywhere positive , the bounce solution is topologically a four - sphere that can be viewed as the hypersurface @xmath42 in a five - dimensional euclidean space , although not necessarily with the metric implied by the embedding . an o(4)-symmetric solution is obtained by requiring invariance under rotations among the first four coordinates .",
    "the scalar field @xmath20 is then a function only of @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ std - cdl ] illustrates such a solution for the case where the bubble nucleates with a size much smaller than the false vacuum horizon length @xmath44 .",
    "analogy with the flat spacetime case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ flat - bounce - sliced ] might suggest that the configuration after nucleation is given by a slice along the `` equator '' of this hypersphere that cuts through the center of the true vacuum region , as shown in the figure , with the tunneling path given by a sequence of parallel horizontal slices .",
    "this interpretation becomes problematic when the bubble size becomes comparable to the horizon length and there is no plausible candidate for the initial configuration .",
    "the is especially so in the limit where the bounce becomes the homogeneous hawking - moss solution  @xcite and a straightforward application of the interpretation would imply that the bounce corresponded to a transition in which all of space fluctuated to @xmath45 , the value at the top of the barrier in @xmath4 .    .",
    "the left - hand view shows the bounce as viewed from a point outside the bounce on an axis perpendicular to the @xmath46-@xmath43 plane , where @xmath46 and @xmath43 correspond to the vertical and horizontal directions in the figure , respectively .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the region of approximately true vacuum .",
    "the horizontal dashed line has often been taken , by analogy with the heavy dashed line in fig.[flat - bounce - sliced ] , as giving the configuration at bubble nucleation .",
    "the right - hand view shows the bounce as viewed from a point to its right on the positive @xmath43-axis .",
    "the @xmath46 axis again corresponds to the vertical direction , while the horizontal direction now corresponds to an axis perpendicular to the @xmath46-@xmath43 plane .. a view from a corresponding point on the negative @xmath43-axis would show only a region of approximate false vacuum.,height=192 ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that one should instead interpret the coleman - de luccia formalism as describing thermal tunneling within a horizon volume , with the temperature being the one defined by the horizon . from this viewpoint , the solutions are analogous to those in flat spacetime at finite temperature , but with the crucial difference that the spatial slices of constant euclidean time are finite in extent .",
    "thus , these solutions exist on a space that is topologically the product of a three - ball ( the horizon volume ) and a circle ( the periodic euclidean time @xmath18 ) .",
    "this suggests a `` low - temperature '' bounce solution such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ flat - sliced - cdl]a .",
    "the boundary of this space is a family of two - spheres , each labeled by a value of @xmath18 .",
    "finally , even if the o(3)@xmath0o(2)-symmetric bounce has only a single negative mode , it is of practical relevance only if its action is less than that of the cdl bounce .",
    "indeed , one of the goals of our investigation was to test the conjecture that the bounce with minimum action has o(4 ) symmetry .",
    "it was already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the thin - wall approximation the o(3)@xmath0o(2)-symmetric bounce always has a higher action than the corresponding cdl action .",
    "our numerical methods allow us explore the much larger parameter space that is allowed when one goes beyond this approximation .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ actionplots ] .",
    "each of the four panels corresponds to a one - dimensional path through this parameter space .",
    "we see that the tunneling exponent for the o(3)@xmath0o(2 ) is never less than that of the cdl bounce .",
    "the two approach and become equal at large values of @xmath47 and of @xmath48 .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that the o(3)@xmath0o(2)-symmetric bounce reduces to the hawking - moss solution when @xmath49 at the top of the barrier [ see eq .",
    "( [ hmcondition ] ) ] . for @xmath50",
    "there is always a cdl bounce whose action is less than that of the hawking - moss solution , but at @xmath51 the cdl solution merges into the hawking - moss .",
    "these numerical tests are , of course , not conclusive .",
    "although we have no reason to expect it , there could be unexplored regions of our parameter space where the action is less than the cdl action .",
    "more generally , there may be other choices of the potential for which the cdl bounce is not optimal .",
    "conclusive analytical results on this issue would be welcome .",
