    "the general case for weak scale supersymmetry has been reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "recently , some evidence has accumulated that is consistent with a light supersymmetric particle spectrum containing a lightest superpartner ( lsp ) that is the lightest neutralino @xmath3 with a high higgsino content@xcite . in such models , a photino  like neutralino @xmath4 can decay @xmath5 , where @xmath3 escapes the detector .",
    "direct pair production of @xmath4 or the indirect pair production from the decays of sneutrino pairs , @xmath6 , can lead to a striking signature @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is missing mass .",
    "such signatures are also possible from neutralino production and decay for a gravitino lsp @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath10 , in models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "see also the references @xcite .    in the standard model",
    ", similar final states can arise from the process @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath11 , the neutrinos are produced through a @xmath12 boson resonance .",
    "hence , the @xmath8 distribution has a characteristic shape peaked at @xmath13 .",
    "however , when @xmath14 , there are additional contributions from virtual @xmath15 bosons . as a result , the @xmath16 process acquires a tail in the @xmath8 distribution far from the @xmath12 boson mass .",
    "the purpose of this report is to quantify the standard model rate for @xmath17 events , so that one can address the significance of any such events with large @xmath8 .",
    "the cross section for the process @xmath0 is calculated using the helicity amplitude library helas@xcite to evaluate amplitudes derived by the program madgraph@xcite .",
    "the inputs to the program are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 gev , @xmath21 gev , @xmath22 gev , and @xmath23 gev",
    ". the calculation is done at a fixed order , with two and only two hard photons in the final state .",
    "the effect of undetected initial state radiation is considered in sec .",
    "3 .    based on the analysis presented by the opal collaboration@xcite",
    ", we require that both photons satisfy @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the photon angle with respect to the beam axis in the laboratory frame , and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the photon energy .",
    "we study the sensitivity of the event rate and distributions to the choices @xmath28=1.75 , 5 , and 10 gev and to another cut on @xmath29 .",
    "our results are summarized in figures 14 . in fig . 1",
    ", we present the missing mass distribution in pb per gev bin for a minimum photon energy of 1.75 gev at @xmath2=161 , 172 , 184 , and 194 gev . the missing mass @xmath8 is defined to be the invariant mass of the four vector @xmath30 . for @xmath31 gev ,",
    "the cross section is negligible .",
    "the integrated cross section for @xmath32 gev is also shown in the figure .",
    "for the machine energies considered , this number is almost a constant , about .016 pb . figs .",
    "2 and 3 show the same distributions for @xmath28=5 and 10 gev respectively .",
    "the integrated cross section for @xmath32 gev is roughly .007 and .003 pb for the two cuts regardless of the beam energy .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "4 shows the correlation between the two photon energies in pb per gev@xmath33 bin at @xmath2=161 gev .",
    "there is a peak when both photons are soft , and a ridge for one soft and one hard photon .",
    "away from this region , the distribution is fairly flat .",
    "if , instead , we require @xmath34 , the results are similar , except that the event rate is higher . for @xmath351.75 , 5 , and 10 gev , the integrated cross section for @xmath32 gev is roughly .074 , .033 , and .016 pb regardless of the beam energy .",
    "these numbers are in agreement with an independent calculation@xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a substantial gain in reducing the standard model contribution to @xmath17 events by focussing on the central region of the detector .",
    "in principle , the colliding @xmath36 and @xmath37 need not each have the beam energy , but may have radiated many undetected photons beforehand . the effect of undetected initial state radiation is to reduce the center of mass energy closer to @xmath13 and to generate a component of missing momentum down the beampipe .",
    "the increasing partonic cross section must be folded with the decreasing probability that the incoming @xmath37 ( @xmath36 ) carries a reduced fraction of the beam energy . in qed ,",
    "the electron momentum distribution functions are entirely calculable , and depend on the inputs @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the beam energy .",
    "we use the next  to  leading  order exponentiated form as described in ref.@xcite and implemented in the pythia subroutine pypdel@xcite .",
    "the effect of undetected initial state photon radiation is illustrated in figs .",
    "58 . in fig . 5",
    ", we present the missing mass distribution in pb per gev bin for a minimum photon energy of 1.75 gev at @xmath2=161 , 172 , 184 , and 194 gev .",
    "the integrated cross section for @xmath32 gev at @xmath40 gev is .035 pb , or more than double the previous estimate without initial state radiation .",
    "this rate decreases slightly for higher beam energies .",
    "6 and 7 show the same distributions for @xmath28=5 and 10 gev respectively .",
    "the integrated cross section for @xmath32 gev is roughly .016 and .008 pb for the two cuts regardless of the beam energy , also about double the previous estimate .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "8 shows the correlation between the two photon energies in pb per gev@xmath33 bin at @xmath2=161 gev .    if @xmath34 , the integrated cross section for @xmath32 gev is roughly .155 , .076 , and .035 pb at @xmath40 gev for @xmath351.75 , 5 , and 10 gev , respectively . as for the case of harder cuts ,",
    "the rates are about double when including initial state radiation .",
    "note that such calculation should not be trusted when one or both of the photons are very soft . in that case",
    ", multiple soft photon emission will be important .",
    "likewise , event generators for a single hard photon and soft photons should not be used to estimate the rate for two hard photons .",
    "finally , other potential standard model contributions to the @xmath17 final state are @xmath41 , where both the electron and positron are undetected in the beam pipe , or @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is any number of undetected photons .",
    "such events can be rejected by demanding that the missing energy vector * not * point down the beampipe and that the photons are not back  to  back in the azimuthal plane .",
    "we have calculated event rates and kinematic distributions for the standard model production of two photons plus missing mass through the process @xmath0 at lep with beam energies @xmath2=161 , 172 , 184 , and 194 gev .",
    "in particular , the calculation includes important contributions from @xmath15 boson exchange when @xmath14 . after applying a missing mass @xmath8 cut of 100 gev and an angular acceptance cut @xmath24 ,",
    "the integrated cross section is fairly independent of the beam energy . for a minimum photon energy of 1.75 , 5 , and 10 gev ,",
    "the expected rate is .016 , .007 , and .003 pb , respectively .",
    "these rates are approximately doubled after including the effect of undetected initial state photon radiation .",
    "the photon energies are highly correlated when one or both are soft , but uncorrelated when both are hard .",
    "the kinematic region with a large @xmath8 and two hard photons appears ideal to search for non  standard model physics , such as supersymmetry with a higgsino  like or gravitino lsp .",
