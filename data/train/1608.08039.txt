    "consider a linear differential - algebraic equation ( dae ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given matrices and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are deterministic noises",

    "intuitively , @xmath10 implies that the initial state @xmath11 is bounded and the noise signals @xmath12 have bounded energy , i.e. bounded @xmath13 norm .",
    "the latter is a standard assumption in robust control  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the classical results on minimax observers ( see  @xcite ) to daes .",
    "namely , we estimate a linear function @xmath14 , @xmath15 of the state trajectory of , based on the output @xmath16 .",
    "since   contain uncertain terms @xmath17 , it follows that , even if @xmath18 was invertible , there could be various state trajectories @xmath19 of , and hence several values of @xmath20 , which are consistent with @xmath16 . for the case of rectangular @xmath18",
    ", the dae   may have several solutions .",
    "this introduces an additional source of uncertainty .",
    "hence , the best we can do is to construct a function @xmath21 such that * for all * state trajectories @xmath19 of , which are consistent with @xmath16 and correspond to @xmath10 , @xmath20 lies in the interval @xmath22 $ ] , and @xmath23 is as small as possible . a dynamical system whose output is @xmath24 and",
    "whose input is @xmath16 is called a _",
    "minimax observer_. in what follows we take @xmath25 for some @xmath26 .",
    "the reason for this is that the state vector @xmath19 of may contain components which are free , possibly discontinuous , exogenous variables .",
    "the estimation of the latter is problematic even for lti systems @xcite , if the observer is required to be an lti system .",
    "in contrast , @xmath27 is always continuous and it is subject to a differential equation .",
    "our main contribution is a new duality principle ( theorem  [ p:5 ] ) .",
    "this result allows us ( i ) to find necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of a minimax observer @xmath24 for finite and infinite time horizons ( theorems  [ p:1:theo],[p:5 ] ) , and ( ii ) to show that @xmath24 can be represented as an output of a time - varying linear system in the finite horizon case ( theorem  [ t : observer - fin - hor ] ) , and as an output of a stable lti system in the case of infinite time horizon ( theorem  [ t : observer - infin - hor ] ) .",
    "finally we prove that for bounded @xmath4 and @xmath5 with possibly unbounded @xmath13 norm , the estimation error remains bounded .      the need for estimating the state of a general dae arises in many applications , as it has been demonstrated by various authors , e.g. , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the classical minimax framework to daes of the form  .",
    "one motivation is to provide control - theoretic grounds for solving an _ issue of approximation and state estimation for partial differential eeuqations _ ( pdes ) , described in  @xcite .",
    "this issue may be resolved by using our results to incorporate pde s approximation error into the estimation process , see section  [ sec : numerical - example ] for an example .      to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "main results of this paper are new .",
    "its preliminary version appeared in @xcite .",
    "with respect to @xcite the main differences are : ( i ) new ( necessary and sufficient ) conditions for existence of minimax observers ( theorem  [ p:5 ] ) , ( ii ) detailed proofs .",
    "duality principle for non - stationary daes was introduced in  @xcite , provided @xmath28 .",
    "it was then used to derive a sub - optimal observer .",
    "in contrast , our duality theorems hold for daes with uncertain @xmath29 and the constructed observers are optimal in that the worst - case estimation errors associated with the observers are minimal ( see definitions  [ d : finhorobs]-[d : infhorobs ] ) .",
    "the algorithm of  @xcite constructing a finite horizon minimax observer by using projectors @xmath30 is a special case of the one of this paper .",
    "minimax observers for discrete time daes were considered in  @xcite .",
    "we note that some papers ( see  @xcite for an overview ) derive observers for regular daes by converting it to the weierstrass canonical form .",
    "if dae has index @xmath31 , then the resulting ode depends on the derivatives of the noise of order @xmath32 , and so the observer would require bounds for them  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our observer is independent of dae s index and works for bounded @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the papers  @xcite present design of @xmath33-observers which force @xmath33-norm of the `` error system '' to be less than a given number . in contrast , ( i ) minimax observers of this paper minimize a different error measure , ( ii ) unlike  @xcite we allow for non - regular daes , and ( iii ) unlike  @xcite we present necessary and sufficient conditions for observer existence ( @xmath0-detectability , theorem  [ p:5 ] ) .",
    "sufficient existence conditions ( partial impulse observability ) for the asymptotic functional observer for   were proposed in  @xcite provided @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , we deal with noisy systems and present necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "design of unknown input observers for daes was considered in  @xcite .",
