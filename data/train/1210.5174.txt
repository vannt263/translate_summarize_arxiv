    "the theory of heat transfer between nanosystems has been developed for a steady state which is usually characterized by time scales much larger than the relaxation time scale of surface plasmon excitations",
    ". however , such time scales are nowadays accessible experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the case of long range plasmons  @xcite these relaxation times could be quite long , demanding the study of the dynamics of heat transfer .",
    "in addition , nearly all the works studying radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale rely on rytov s flucutational elextrodynamics  @xcite which is based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem of the second kind  @xcite , and on macroscopic maxwell equations .",
    "this theoretical framework was very succesful in the past .",
    "indeed , the seminal works by lifshitz , and by polder and van hove  @xcite , paved the way for numerous studies of casimir - lifshitz forces and nanoscale radiative heat transfer . as a matter of fact , the main assumption in rytov s theory is that the considered systems are in local thermal equilibrium . by introducing macroscopic thermal fluctuating currents or dipole moments",
    "it is therefore possible to relate the correlation functions of the currents or dipoles to the material properties by applying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "therefore , the theory is a phenomenological one which has no microscopic justification and enables one to study stationary or quasi - stationary situations only  @xcite .",
    "a genuinely microscopic quantum mechanical description for the heat transfer problem was provided by janowicz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using the caldera - legget model .",
    "but again , this work restricts itself to the steady state , showing that this quantum mechanical description leads to the same results for the heat transfer problem as rytov s theory .    in this work",
    ", we will introduce a simple quantum mechanical model which allows us to study the dynamics of the heat transfer rate between two nanosystems in general and between two nanoparticles in particular . to keep",
    "our model simple we will right from the start assume that we have only two nanoparticles supporting localized surface modes which are assumed to provide the main heat flux channel  @xcite .",
    "by this assumption we neglect any contribution due to eddy currents  @xcite , crossed electromagnetic interaction  @xcite , multipoles  @xcite , non - debye relaxation inside the nanoparticle  @xcite , and many - particle effects  @xcite .",
    "then , the nanoparticles can be modeled as quantum mechanical oscillators which are coupled due to the interaction of the localized surface modes through their electromagnetic fields . since we are interested in the heat flow , both nanoparticles are coupled to their own heat baths . by deriving the master equation for this system we can determine the dynamics of the heat transfer rate towards the steady state .",
    "we establish the connection of our model to the results obtained from rytov s theory  @xcite by comparison with the steady state solutions of our model .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii we motivate and introduce our model .",
    "the master equation is derived in section iii , where we also determine the analytical solutions as well as the short- and large - time limits of these solutions and the lowest order perturbation results . in section",
    "iv we define the heat transfer rate and show how it can be derived using fermi s golden rule . finally , in section v we compare the steady - state result of our model with the known steady - state solutions for the heat transfer rate between two nanoparticles determining the coupling constant parameter of our model . in this section",
    "we also discuss the relaxation dynamics of the heat transfer rate between two nanoparticles .",
    "the aim of our work is to study the heat transfer dynamics between two nanosystems . in particular , we model the resonant heat transfer between two nanoparticles which support localized surface modes by means of a quantum mechanical approach .",
    "our model is motivated by the fact that nanoparticles or nanosystems which have an extension smaller than the wavelength of the impinging electromagnetic field can be described by a dipole moment @xmath0 which is induced by the field .",
    "this induced dipole moment is related to the incoming field @xmath1 by  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the polarizability of the nanoparticle and @xmath4 is the permittivity of vacuum .",
    "the resonance of the nanoparticle is determined by the poles of the polarizability . for metallic nanoparticles",
    "this resonance can be attributed to collective charge density oscillations within the particle which are called localized surface plasmons .    considering a very small spherical nanoparticle",
    "the polarizability can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radius of the nanoparticle and @xmath7 is its permittivity . from this expression for the polarizability it becomes apparent that the resonance of the nanoparticle is given by @xmath8 .",
    "this implicit equation can in general be solved for a complex frequency @xmath9 which determines the oscillation frequency @xmath10 of the localized charge oscillation and its damping or spectral width @xmath11 due to losses inside the nanoparticle . for drude metals with the permittivity @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the plasma frequency , @xmath14 the background permittivity and @xmath15 a phenomenological damping constant we find @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 which is in general the case .",
    "let us now assume that we have two identical nanoparticles @xmath19 and @xmath20 as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchnanoparticle ] .",
    "particle @xmath19 has some nonzero temperature @xmath21 and particle @xmath20 has temperature @xmath22 .",
    "then localized surface modes will be excited inside particle @xmath19 due to the thermal fluctuations of the charges inside that particle if @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath25 is planck s constant .",
    "the thermally excited resonant charge oscillations generate a dipole field which will excite localized charge oscillations inside particle @xmath20 .",
    "since the charge oscillations are damped inside particle @xmath20 a part of the exitation energy will be converted into heat and particle @xmath20 heats up , whereas particle @xmath19 cools down . of course , the charge oscillations inside particle @xmath20 will also excite charge oscillations in particle @xmath19 and so forth . so that we can expect that energy will be transferred back and forth between the particles until a steady state or equilibrium situation is reached",
    ".    the heat flux between two nanoparticles within the steady state can be calculated by using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite and was for example studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we are interested in the dynamics of the relaxation towards the steady state which amounts to apply a full non - equilibrium description . to this end , we first chose to describe the two nanoparticles as quantum mechanical oscillators @xmath19 and @xmath20 having a frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two oscillators is @xmath26 here @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the creation and annihilation operators associated to oscillator @xmath19 and @xmath20 which fulfill the bosonic commutation relations @xmath31 = [ b , b^\\dagger ] = 1 $ ] .",
    "note , that the zero point contribution is not taken into account , since it does not affect the dynamics .",
    "the interaction of the two nanoparticles which is attributed to the coupled charge oscillations is now taken into account by a linear coupling between oscillator @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the form @xmath32 that means we allow for the exchange of photons ( single photon process ) between the two oscillators .",
    "the first term describes the photon transfer from particle @xmath19 to particle @xmath20 , i.e.   @xmath33 , whereas the second term describes the photon transfer from particle @xmath20 to particle @xmath19 , i.e.  @xmath34 .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 can be estimated by a variety of methods  one of which is described in sec v. the most direct and general method is to use an analog of the mode - mode coupling theory as in case of waveguides @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is essentially given by the overlap of the plasmon field produced by the nanoparticle @xmath19 with the plasmon field of the nano particle @xmath20 . note that if @xmath36 then we are in the perturbative regime , however for @xmath37 we have non - perturbative regime where rabi oscillations occur .",
    "the situation is somewhat reminiscent of cavity qed  @xcite .",
    "since both nanoparticles can attain a temperature we couple each oscillator to its own heat bath which consist of a spectrum of independent oscillators  @xcite described by the two hamiltonians @xmath38 again the creation and annihilation operators @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 fulfill the bosonic commutation relations @xmath43 = [ a_{2i } , a_{2j}^\\dagger ] = \\delta_{ij}$ ] ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the oscillator frequencies .",
    "we assume that both heat baths are in thermal equilibrium at temperatures @xmath21 and @xmath46 , i.e.  the density operators of the heat baths are given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the inverse temperature .",
    "we further assume that each nanoparticle described by the harmonic oscillators @xmath19 and @xmath20 is linearly coupled to its heat bath @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonians are given by @xmath51 introducing the coupling strengths @xmath52 and @xmath53 which are related to the damping @xmath11 of the charge oscillations modeled by the oscillators @xmath19 and @xmath20 . when assuming that both reservoirs are in thermal equilibrium at temperatures @xmath21 and @xmath46 and there is no interaction between oscillator @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath54 ) , then by means of this coupling to their heat baths both oscillators will in the long - time limit reach an equilibrium state described by the reduced density operators @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the two harmonic oscillators @xmath19 and @xmath20 would acquire the temperatures of their heat baths if there is no coupling , i.e.  @xmath54 .",
    "since in our model the coupling @xmath58 between the oscillators @xmath19 and @xmath20 they will in general not acquire the temperatures of their reservoirs in the long - time limit .",

    "equal to zero . solving the resulting set of equations we obtain @xmath77 with @xmath78",
    "the steady state expressions allow us to check the plausibility of our approach .",
