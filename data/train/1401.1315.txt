    "<S> our starting point is a hydrodynamic description of compressible polar active fluids  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since we are chiefly interested in structures varying only along the main direction of motion , we focus here on a one - dimensional problem . </S>",
    "<S> the local density field @xmath6 obeys a conservation equation which complements the equation governing the momentum field @xmath7 , where @xmath8 $ ] is a polarization field . following toner and </S>",
    "<S> tu  @xcite these equations read @xmath9 where all the coefficients _ a priori _ depend both on @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomenological equations were introduced to account for a continuous mean - field transition from a homogeneous isotropic state with @xmath12 and @xmath13 when @xmath14 , to a homogeneous polarized state with @xmath15 when @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the @xmath17 term reflects the pressure gradient induced by density heterogenities . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two transport coefficients associated respectively with the advection and the diffusion of the local order parameter . following  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we now look for propagating solutions of eqs .   and : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the propagation speed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this ansatz reduces eq .   to an algebraic relation : @xmath23 when a band moves in an isotropic gas , see e.g. fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b , the constant @xmath24 corresponds to the gas density . inserting the latter expression in eq </S>",
    "<S> .   leads to a second order ordinary differential equation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is defined via @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the dot symbol denotes derivative with respect to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the band - pattern problem is recast into a dynamical system framework : establishing the shape of the bands amounts to describing the motion of a particle of mass @xmath19 and position @xmath30 in a potential @xmath26 , and experiencing a nonlinear friction @xmath31 , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] , these trajectories respectively correspond to three possible propagating patterns @xmath36 : ( i ) a smectic phase composed of ordered bands ( @xmath30 varies periodically with @xmath37 ) , ( ii ) a localized solitary wave , the length of which being set by the \" time  taken to explore the homoclinic cycle , ( iii ) a polar - liquid droplet separated by domain walls from an isotropic gaseous phase , the fraction of polar liquid being given by the ratio between the waiting times at the two saddle points . </S>",
    "<S> these three patterns exactly correspond to those _ hitherto _ observed in model experiments , and in numerical simulations at the onset of collective motion .    motivated by this pivotal observation </S>",
    "<S> , we now turn to the study of equation  . for sake of clarity </S>",
    "<S> we henceforth specify the functional dependence of the phenomenological coefficients in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> as the density is a control parameter of the transition to collective motion for all models based on short - range alignment interactions , @xmath38 has to change sign at a finite density @xmath39  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different systems may result in different functions @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a simple linear dependence @xmath40 which is consistent , close to @xmath39 , with all existing kinetic theories  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed lines correspond the the conditions @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath54 , the black full line corresponds to the supercritical hopf - bifurcation . </S>",

    "<S> - have been fully defined , we can obtain their propagative solutions explicitly by solving eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the two functions @xmath26 and @xmath31 are parametrized by two independent parameters : @xmath24 and @xmath22 , which specify the shape of the bands . </S>",
    "<S> their explicit form are provided in  @xcite and @xmath51 is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a for a given set of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of closed trajectories in the @xmath35 plane requires that the system has at least one fixed point  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , keeping in mind that eq </S>",
    "<S> .   describes the motion of a massive particle in a potential , we look for trajectories that display at least one oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> this obviously requires : ( i ) that @xmath51 has a local minimum at a finite value @xmath56 ( and thus a local maximum at @xmath57 ) , and ( ii ) that the friction @xmath58 changes sign at a finite @xmath53 so that the particle do not fall to and remains stuck at @xmath59 where @xmath51 is minimum . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that the former condition implies @xmath60 , and the latter @xmath61 . in order to establish the shape of the periodic trajectories of the dynamical system , and in turn the shape of the bands , we need to go beyond this simple picture . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the auxiliary variable @xmath62 and recast eq .   into the 2-dimensional dynamical system : @xmath63\\\\ \\label{ds2 } \\dot z & = - \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}h}{{\\mathrm{d}}w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this change of variable greatly simplifies the investigation of the fixed points of the dynamical system now defined by eqs  -  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has at least two fixed points : @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> a conventional linear stability analysis shows that @xmath64 is always a saddle point . </S>",
    "<S> conversely the second fixed point @xmath65 calls for a more careful discussion . </S>",
    "<S> it undergoes a hopf - bifurcation as @xmath66 changes sign , as can be seen on the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this bifurcation , which we will thoroughly characterize elsewhere  @xcite , is supercritical ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> subcritical ) if @xmath54 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 ) , where the critical velocity @xmath68 is defined implicitly by @xmath69 . both the bifurcation line and @xmath68 can be computed analytically and are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , regardless of its sub- or super - critical nature the hopf bifurcation results in an unstable spiral trajectory which can lead the system towards a cyclic attractor . </S>",
    "<S> we now describe how these limit cycles are explored in the @xmath70 plane , and relate these nonlinear trajectories to the morphologies of the band patterns .    _ polar smectic phase / periodic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> _ to gain more quantitative insight , we consider large - amplitude cycles in the limit of small @xmath19  @xcite . for small @xmath30 , eq </S>",
    "<S> .   implies that the system quickly relaxes towards the curve @xmath71 in a time @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> close to the origin , the dynamics is controlled by the linear properties of the saddle point @xmath64 , which defines two well - separated scales . </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily shown that the stable direction is nearly horizontal , it is associated with a fast relaxation at the rate @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the unstable direction is nearly tangent to the curve @xmath74 , and corresponds , again in the small-@xmath19 limit , to a much slower growth at the rate @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of large - amplitude cycles immediately follows from this discussion and from the parabolic shape of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> let us start from the left of the cycle , point  a in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a , close to the origin . </S>",
    "<S> we call @xmath76 the abscissa of this point , which is the minimum value of @xmath30 in the cycle . </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , the trajectory first remains near the parabola @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> if a is close enough to the origin , this part of the cycle is explored slowly , in a time @xmath77 . then the trajectory approaches the unstable point @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore leaves the parabola and starts spiraling , at a point labeled b in fig .  [ fig3]a ( b is here defined as the point where the trajectory deviates from the @xmath78 curve by 5% ) . </S>",
    "<S> it finally crosses the parabola again , at point  c , and @xmath79 changes sign , see eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 then decreases and the system quickly goes back to point  a in a time typically set by @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> to further check this picture we have numerically computed the phase portraits of eqs .   and  , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ( dotted lines ) . the typical periodic orbit shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ( full line ) is in excellent agreement with the scenario described above . from this analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we infer the shape of the steadily propagating band pattern @xmath36 . as anticipated , periodic orbits correspond to a polar smectic phase composed of equally - spaced bands , in qualitative agreement with the experimental pictures reported in  @xcite , and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical shape of a smectic pattern is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> it is composed of strongly asymmetric excitations , which reflects the time - scale separation in the underlying dynamical system close to the origin ; the large - amplitude bands are composed of a long exponential tail , and of a sharp front at the head . </S>",
    "<S> note that we describe here the propagation of large - amplitude excitations in a polarized environment . </S>",
    "<S> however the minimum polarization in the regions separating the bands , @xmath76 , can be vanishingly small . in this limit the period of the crystalline structure would diverge logarithmically as @xmath81 .    _ solitary bands / homoclinic cycles . </S>",
    "<S> _ in the limiting case where the minimal value of @xmath30 goes to 0 ( @xmath82 ) , </S>",
    "<S> point a then corresponds to the saddle located at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the orbits followed by the dynamical system become homoclinic . as exemplified in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c , they are not periodic anymore , as the trajectory remains stuck at @xmath64 . in real space , the associated pattern is a solitary wave emerging out of a disordered gas , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the existence of solitonic structures at the onset of collective motion is one of the more robust observations made in agent - based simulations  @xcite , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b .    </S>",
    "<S> _ polar liquid droplets / heteroclinic cycles . </S>",
    "<S> _ until now , we have restricted our analysis to the case where the dynamical system only probes the first two extrema of @xmath51 . however , looking for high - speed solutions ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath51 displays an additional extremum at @xmath84 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]e . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 is a second saddle point . </S>",
    "<S> therefore heteroclinic cycles are found when a is located at the origin and c at the second saddle . </S>",
    "<S> the cycles are not periodic as the dynamics freezes both at @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in real space , the corresponding structure , @xmath36 , is a localized domain , a polar - liquid droplet , traveling in a disordered gas , whose length is given by the residence at point c , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]f . </S>",
    "<S> this phase - separation pattern corresponds to the one numerically observed in the active spin model , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c , and in a generalization of the 2d toner and tu model  @xcite . in the small @xmath42 limit </S>",
    "<S> , the shapes of the asymmetric domain walls bounding the polar - liquid droplets can be computed exactly  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> several comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we emphasize that the salient features of the swarming patterns do not depend on the specific functional forms of the hydrodynamic coefficients in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the limit - cycle solutions solely require the existence of a hopf bifurcation , and the dynamics along this cycle is chiefly controlled by the stability of the other fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at a qualitative level , only the global shapes of the effective potential @xmath26 and the friction curve @xmath31 matter . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we shall stress that a hydrodynamic theory where @xmath88 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> would yield non - linear patterns qualitatively identical to those shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> only the sign reversal of @xmath38 at @xmath39 was necessary to observe band patterns , in agreement with  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we emphasize that travelling band can exist when the average density @xmath89 is smaller than @xmath39 , though the linear stability of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) predicts that no small - amplitude wave can propagate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental propagative excitations of polar active matter are intrinsically nonlinear below @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , we come back to the status of the solutions described above . </S>",
    "<S> until now we have identified an infinite family of band - type solutions , located in the vicinity of the hopf - bifurcation line in the @xmath91 plane , grey region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries of this region are found by looking for non - degenerate solutions satisfying @xmath92  @xcite , and its extent is an increasing function of the diffusivity @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the domain of existence of the bands collapses on the hopf - bifurcation line in the limit @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the homoclinic cycles , corresponding to solitary waves , are constraint to include one saddle point . </S>",
    "<S> therefore they define a one - parameter ensemble of band - type solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this ensemble corresponds to the lower boundary of the phase diagram , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ( dashed - dotted line ) , and is established by taking the infinite - period limit . </S>",
    "<S> the heteroclinic solution , polar - liquid droplet , is constrained by the existence of two saddles along a cycle . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if any , the heteroclinic cycle is unique . it is a limiting case of the one - parameter homoclinic family , point @xmath94 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the pattern - selection problem . </S>",
    "<S> the ensemble of band - type solutions described above is actually restrained by the mass - conservation law . </S>",
    "<S> the mean density @xmath89 in the system is fixed , therefore only band shapes compatible with this value exist . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are a priori left with an infinite family of solutions , which is parametrized by one free parameter . hence , we predict that , for a given value of @xmath89 , several solutions propagating at different speeds may coexist . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture is again supported by numerical evidences . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] the three - band and single - band patterns correspond to identical values of all the simulation parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the full resolution of the challenging pattern - selection problem obviously goes beyond the scope of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> however , a tentative picture for the nucleation of stationary swarms from a disordered state can be attempted from eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of sharp fronts is natural since the l.h.s . of   </S>",
    "<S> has the form of burgers equation , which supports rarefaction shocks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a density fluctuation above @xmath39 grows and polarizes via the generic coupling between density and order embodied in the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath95 in eq .  . when these two competing effects balance each other , the density at the top of the shock is pinned , and a constant - shape asymmetric band steadily propagates . in the transient regime </S>",
    "<S> , we therefore expect several bands to form and collide , until the system reaches one of the possible steady states . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism might favor large - amplitude / fast bands via coalescence events , in agreement with the experiments reported in  @xcite .    to close this letter we comment on the role of fluctuations on the transition towards collective motion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> .   predicts a second - order transition for homogeneous systems . </S>",
    "<S> here , we have evidenced that stationary polarized excitations ( solitary bands , and polar - liquid droplets ) can coexist with a homogeneous isotropic phase , which in turn confirms the first order scenario evidenced in numerical simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this coexistence does not rely on any fluctuation - induced mechanism , unlike all the conventional equilibrium scenarios making first order a mean - field second - order transition ( e.g. brazowskii  @xcite and halperin - lubensky - ma  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , beyond the mean - field deterministic picture , fluctuations are very likely to play a major role in the stability , the selection , and the ordering of the band patterns . </S>",
