    "in the present paper we correct an error made in the calculation for the angular distribution of radiated gluons as presented in @xcite .",
    "we recalculate the quantitative predictions of the integrated energy loss outside an angular cone , defining the jet , with fixed opening angle , @xmath4 , and derive the expression for the ratio @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the completely integrated loss .",
    "we confirm our previous result that @xmath7 is a universal function of the variable @xmath8 , where @xmath3 is the transport coefficient characteristic of the medium .",
    "in particular we now find that @xmath9 is strongly peaked at small values of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , a feature already obtained by wiedemann @xcite .",
    "finally , we explicitly show that the induced radiated gluon momentum spectrum derived in our formalism is equivalent with the one derived in the zakharov - wiedemann approach @xcite , namely in the form given in@xcite .",
    "in this section we repeat shortly the discussion of the induced momentum spectrum of soft gluon emission @xmath12 from a fast quark jet , which is produced _ inside _ the medium by a hard scattering at time @xmath13 . from the production point",
    "the quark propagates over a length @xmath2 of qcd matter , carrying out many scatterings via gluon exchange with the medium .",
    "in the bdmps approach@xcite the spectrum per unit length @xmath14 of the medium consists of two terms : one corresponding to an `` on - shell '' quark , as if that quark were entering the medium , and one corresponding to a hard production vertex . from @xcite",
    "we quote the induced gluon spectrum in the soft @xmath15 limit : @xmath16 v ( \\underline{q } ) \\ , { \\cal f}_{fsi } \\ ,   \\bigg|^{\\tilde\\kappa = 0 } _ { \\tilde\\kappa},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 differs from @xmath18 in that the gluon emission time has been evaluated at the time of the hard interaction , @xmath13 .",
    "we remind that the the medium - independent factorisation contribution is eliminated by a subtraction of the value of the integrals at @xmath19 , where this parameter is @xmath20 it depends on medium properties , in particular on the quark mean free path @xmath21 , as well as on the gluon energy @xmath15 .",
    "the other symbols are explained in @xcite .",
    "next we convert ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) to impact parameter space as explained in @xcite , and we rescale the time variable @xmath22 and define @xmath23 .",
    "we obtain the spectrum in terms of impact parameter integrals , @xmath24 e^{- \\frac{\\tilde v}{2 } ( \\underline{b}_1 - \\underline{b}_2)^2 ( \\tau_0 -   \\tau_2 ) } \\bigg|^{\\tilde\\kappa = 0}_{\\tilde\\kappa } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we still have to evaluate the explicit expressions for @xmath25 , and especially for @xmath26 .",
    "we recall that the amplitude @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "from the fact that @xmath26 and @xmath25 have the same time evolution given by the harmonic oscillator green function @xmath30 ( cf .",
    "eq.(5.6 ) of @xcite ) , i.e. in eq . ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) , @xmath31 while the initial conditions satisfy ( in the soft gluon limit ) @xmath32 as can be seen from eqs.(17b ) and ( 37 ) of @xcite .    here",
    "we note the mistake in our paper @xcite : instead of the correct eq.([eq:2.xx ] ) we have taken @xmath33 i.e. effectively we have taken out of the integrand in eq.([eq:2.yy ] ) the factor @xmath34 , and replaced it by @xmath35 !",

    "in the following we recalculate the integrated loss _ outside _ an angular cone of opening angle @xmath10 , @xmath40    we note that for @xmath41 the total loss is obtained , namely @xcite @xmath42 we consider the normalized loss @xcite by defining the ratio @xmath43 with @xmath44 , by using the same ( dimensionless ) variables and definitions as in @xcite .",
    "we confirm that the ratio @xmath7 turns out to depend on one single dimensionless variable @xmath45 where @xmath46 this `` scaling behaviour '' of @xmath47 means that the medium and size dependence is universally contained in the function @xmath48 , which is a function of the transport coefficient @xmath49 and of the length @xmath2 , as defined by ( [ eq:3.9 ] ) .    as a consequence",
    "the discussion of the medium properties is qualitatively the same as in @xcite , and does not need to be repeated here .",
    "quantitatively the corrected ratio @xmath47 is plotted in fig .  1 .    a sharp peak at small values of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , can be seen in this figure , especially with the help of the insert .",
    "this behaviour of the loss @xmath52 has been already noticed by wiedemann in @xcite . for @xmath53",
    "the dependence is numerically as given in our previous work @xcite .    when comparing hot and cold qcd matter we recall @xcite that for fixed @xmath2 @xmath54 this implies that e.g. for @xmath55 , the position of the peak seen in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to very small cones : @xmath56 for nuclear , and @xmath57 for hot ( at reference temperature @xmath58 ) matter , respectively . for @xmath59",
    "the energy loss , @xmath7 , drops quickly with increasing @xmath10 , the behaviour already known from the discussion in @xcite .    for a quark jet produced in the medium the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath60",

    "( [ eq:2.8 ] ) . the lower limit of the @xmath71-integral of @xmath67 exactly cancels the term coming from @xmath63 , while its upper limit , at @xmath72 , contains @xmath73 which is @xmath74-independent and therefore canceled by the @xmath75 subtraction term present in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.8 ] ) .",
