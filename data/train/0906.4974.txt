    "narrow  line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) were initially classified by osterbrock & pogge  ( 1985 ) as a peculiar subset of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with strong , narrow h@xmath0 emission ( fwhm(h@xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) , relatively weak [ oiii ] , and strong optical feii emission .",
    "these spectral properties cause nls1s to stand out at one extreme end of the boroson & green  ( 1992 ) `` eigenvector 1 '' ( ev1 ) . the physical driver behind ev1",
    "is debated , but is usually thought to correlate with the eddington luminosity ratio , @xmath3 .",
    "nls1s then lie at the extreme end of ev1 corresponding to high @xmath3 ( pounds et al .",
    "1995 ) and also seem to have lower black hole masses than broad  line agns of similar luminosities .",
    "subsequent x - ray studies found that many nls1s have unusual x - ray properties as well ( e.g. , puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 ) . as a class ,",
    "they exhibit ultrasoft ( @xmath4 ) x - ray spectra compared to `` normal '' seyfert 1s ( boller et al .",
    "1996 ) , while some also show soft x - ray emission in excess of that expected from a power law ( leighly  1999 ) .",
    "kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) noted that this ultrasoft x - ray emission may be a consequence of high accretion rates , and a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath5 is indeed observed in the grupe  ( 2004 ) sample .",
    "mathur  ( 2000 ) proposed that the high accretion rate and low black hole mass indicate that nls1s are `` young '' agn ; i.e. the central black holes are in an early stage of their growth .",
    "it was later found that nls1s tend to fall below the @xmath6 relation observed for broad  line seyfert 1s supporting this idea ( mathur et al .",
    "2001 ) and bringing up the intriguing possibility that agn are `` born '' off of the @xmath6 relation and eventually grow onto it through accretion ( grupe & mathur  2004 ; mathur & grupe 2005a , b ; watson et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "because of these properties , soft x - ray selection has proven to be an efficient technique for finding large numbers of nls1s ( grupe et al .",
    "however , the aggregate x - ray properties of nls1s can not be easily studied with soft x - ray  selected samples because these necessarily exclude any nls1s with harder x - ray emission , if they exist .",
    "these issues were partially resolved by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with its homogeneous selection criteria , and in particular the subsample of williams et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter w02 ) selected from the sdss solely on the basis of the osterbrock & pogge  ( 1985 ) optical spectral criteria . indeed , the nls1s from that sample which also appeared in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) have on average flatter spectra than soft x - ray selected samples ( w02 ) .",
    "a substantial number of nls1s in the w02 sample should have been detected in the rass based on their optical brightness , but were not .",
    "short ( 2ks ) observations of 17 of these x - ray ",
    "faint nls1s were taken with _",
    "chandra _ in a follow  up study ( williams et al .",
    "2004 ; hereafter w04 ) .",
    "some of these objects exhibit x - ray properties typical of nls1s , with @xmath7 and x - ray to optical luminosity ratios consistent with the rass  detected nls1s in w02 . however , four of the nls1s in the w04 sample are detected as unusually hard and faint sources , with @xmath8 inferred from the _ chandra _ spectral fit or hardness ratio ( see below for details ) .",
    "additionally , those objects with low @xmath5 tend to be much fainter in x - rays than the average for rass  detected nls1s and the high@xmath5 w04 nls1s .    from works of w02 and w04",
    "it is quite clear that nls1s are much more heterogeneous in their accretion properties than previously thought ;",
    "i.e.  even though nls1s _ as a class _ have high @xmath3 , not all nls1s do ( see also nikolajuk , czerny , & gurynowicz 2009 ) .",
    "some nls1s have steep x - ray spectra , but some do not .",
    "some nls1s have strong feii emission , but some do not .",
    "it does appear that , for the most part , nls1s with large @xmath3 have steep @xmath5 ( grupe  2004 ) and strong feii emission , and those are the objects whose black holes are still growing ( mathur & grupe 2005a , b ) .",
    "of the four flat ",
    "spectrum nls1s in w04 , two are very peculiar ( sdss j143030.22@xmath9001115 and sdss j1259@xmath100102 ) with inferred @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , much too flat even for normal seyfert 1 galaxies which have average @xmath13 .    the original classification of sdss j143030.22@xmath9001115.1 ( sdss j1430 - 0011 here after ) as a nls1 was based on the sdss spectrum ( w02 ) .",
    "bian , cui & chao ( 2006 ) analyzed this spectrum again and found that if you remove the narrow components of h@xmath0 , the remaining broad component has fwhm= 26002900 km s@xmath2 ( dependent upon exact modeling ) .",
    "since the formal definition of nls1 ( goodrich 1989 ) has a maximum width of 2000 km s@xmath2 , bian et al .",
    "argue that sdss 1430 - 0011 is not a nls1 .",
    "even if sdss j1430 - 0011 is a bls1 or a nls1 ( discussed further in  5.1 ) , the spectrum with @xmath11 is still peculiarly flat .    in principle , the low x - ray luminosities and low photon indices seen in either of these agns could be caused by high intrinsic column density or variability ( though it is unlikely that both would be in such a low state during both the rass and _ chandra _ observations ) .",
    "unfortunately the individual _ chandra _ spectra of the four hardest nls1s contained too few counts to constrain both @xmath14 and @xmath5 , but a stacked spectrum of all four showed no evidence for strong absorption ( @xmath15 at the @xmath16 confidence level ) . a high s / n spectrum is clearly required to understand whether the spectrum is truly flat or appears flat due to complexity .",
    "we were awarded 25 ks of xmm time to obtain a high s / n spectrum of sdss j1430 - 0011 ( z=0.1032 ) . in observations ,",
    "the source was found to be faint , with count rate cr=0.012 .",
    "w04 characterized its spectrum in therms of the hardness ratio , defined as @xmath17 , where h and s are the net counts in the hard and soft bands , respectively ( the hard band is defined as @xmath18 and the soft band as @xmath19 ) .",
    "they found @xmath20 .",
    "they also fit a simple power - law to data and infer @xmath21 . in the following , we present observations of this source",
    "the nls1 sdss j1430 - 0011 was observed with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn and mos detectors on 06 january 2008 for a total of 25 ks .",
    "all instruments were observed in extended full frame mode with thin filters .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data were reduced using science analysis system ( sas ) 7.1.0 .",
    "light curves were initially produced for both epic pn and mos images in order to check for flaring high background .",
    "periods of high background are typically produced by protons in the earth s atmosphere with energies @xmath22 100 _ kev _ which are funneled towards the detectors by the x - ray mirrors .",
    "low background intervals were then produced by excluding data taken when the full - field count rates exceeded 20 s@xmath2 in the pn and 2.5 s@xmath2 in the mos .",
    "photon pile - up was also checked for , and was determined not to be a problem .",
    "images were produced and binned into square pixels of 4  .",
    "source and background data were then extracted .    for the epic pn data ,",
    "the source counts were extracted with a circular region of 20  centered on the object . since the source was close to a chip gap , background data was extracted from a source free circular region of 20  on the same ccd at about the same distance from the readout node .",
    "furthermore , the source and background data were filtered to include only single and double events ( pattern 0 - 4 ) .    for the mos data ,",
    "the source was extracted in a circular region of 20  centered on the object .",
    "the background was extracted in a surrounding annulus of outer and inner radii 50  and 25  respectively .",
    "additionally , the source and background data were filtered to include singles , doubles , triples , and quadruples ( pattern 0 - 12 ) .",
    "the sas task _ backscale _ was then run on both data sets to take into account bad pixels and ccd boundaries .",
    "a redistribution matrix file and ancillary response file were then produced with the tasks _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ respectively .",
    "the final effective exposure times and count rates for pn , mos1 and mos2 cameras are given in table 1 .",
    "the pn and mos spectra were binned to have a minimum of 30 and 15 counts per bin , respectively , using the ftools program _ grppha _ and then analyzed using the 12.3.1 software package .",
    "joint fits were made to the pn and mos spectra .",
    "we use solar abundances from lodders ( 2003 ) and photo - electric absorption cross - sections from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) . throughout the data analysis we use h@xmath23=70 km s@xmath2",
    "mpc@xmath2 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "we fit a variety of models , all of which are described in detail in the subsections below . in every model we included absorption by the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way which was held fixed when fitting the spectrum .",
    "the galactic column density toward sdss j1430 - 0011 is @xmath26 ( dicky and lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the goodness of fit was determined through @xmath27 statistic .",
    "the errors quoted are for 90% confidence for one interesting parameter ( @xmath28 ) . in table 2",
    "we list only the acceptable models with their fit parameters .",
    "before any modeling was done to the data , we applied the results from the observation .",
    "we fit our data with a simple power - law , and fixed the photon index @xmath29 ( derived in w04 ) .",
    "we looked to see how the model behaved , and then made some assumptions about the structure of the continuum and chose additional models accordingly .",
    "the flat continuum derived from the data did not match the data at all and indicated that the true spectrum is more complex than a simple power - law .",
    "outlined below are the models we used .",
    "joint fits were made to epic pn and mos spectra for @xmath30 . for simplicity",
    ", we have included their syntax .",
    "+ * model 1 : simple power - law * : this simple photon power - law model ( at the redshift of the source ) was fit with the command _",
    "wabs(zpow)_. the free parameters of the model were the photon index @xmath5 , and the normalization .",
    "this was not a good fit , with @xmath31 for 60 degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , the best fit @xmath32 , is very different from the @xmath33 derived from the data .",
    "the true spectrum of the source , therefore , must be more complex than a simple power - law . as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the fit left significant residuals at around 1 kev .",
    "this is suggestive of an ionized absorber along the line of sight ; such a model is discussed below .",
    "* model 2 : intrinsic absorber * : apparent flatness of a continuum can be caused by incorrect modeling of absorption . to investigate whether this is the case , we next fitted the data with a model with intrinsic absorption and a simple power - law continuum at the redshift of the source ( model _ wabs*zwabs(zpow ) _ ) .",
    "the free parameters in this model were @xmath14 , @xmath5 , and the normalization .",
    "this model did not result in a good fit either ( @xmath34 for 59 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the residuals to the fit showed excess counts below about 1 kev .",
    "this implies that simple absorption by neutral matter at the source is not the cause of the apparent flatness of the spectrum .",
    "* model 3 : ionized absorber * : this model consists of an ionized absorber with a simple power - law continuum at the redshift of the source ( model _ wabs*absori(zpow ) _ )",
    ". the free parameters of this model are @xmath14 , @xmath5 , the normalization , and absorber ionization state @xmath35 , where l is the integrated luminosity from 5 ev to 300 kev , r is the radial distance from the source to the ionized material , and @xmath36 is the number density of electrons ( done , et al .",
    "the temperature was held fixed at @xmath37  k , and the iron abundance was held fixed at the solar value . ] .",
    "this resulted in an acceptable fit ( table 2 ) .",
    "the best fit vales of the parameters are @xmath38 and the column density of the ionized absorber @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "the ionization parameter is @xmath41 .",
    "the intrinsic power - law slope is in the normal range observed for agns .",
    "figure 2 shows the spectral fit of this model .",
    "* model 4 : partially covering absorber * : the apparently flat spectrum , the excess of counts at low energy in model 2 , and the dip in the residuals to the model 1 fit , are suggestive of a partially covering absorber , so we try this model next ( model _ wabs*zpcfabs(zpow ) _ ) .",
    "the free parameters of this model are @xmath5 , the normalization , @xmath14 , and the covering fraction .",
    "the quality of this fit was similarly acceptable to that of model 3 ( table 2 ) .",
    "the best fit vales of the parameters are @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath40 .",
    "the covering fraction is @xmath44 .",
    "the power - law slope is in the range observed for nls1s .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectral fit and the confidence contours are shown in figure 4 .",
    "* model 5 : disk blackbody * : in an attempt to rule out other possible scenarios , we looked at additional models that may also have been representative of our source .",
    "as discussed above , residuals to model 2 show excess at low energies .",
    "similarly , if we fit the spectrum with a simple power - law for e@xmath452 and extrapolate it down to lower energies , we again see an excess in data .",
    "this upturn may indicate soft excess which is a characteristic of nls1s .",
    "the cause of the soft excess in nls1s is a matter of debate ( see e.g. atlee & mathur 2009 and references therein ) . for the purpose of this paper , however , we are only interested in parametrizing the excess , so we looked at blackbody , comptonization , and thermal plasma models described by page , et al .",
    "only the disk blackbody model was deemed acceptable based on fit statistics , which is discussed here .",
    "a disk blackbody model describes the emission from an accretion disk as a series of blackbodies at different temperatures , which are emitting from different radii ( see mitsuda et al . , 1984 and makishima et al .",
    ", 1986 . ) ; model _ wabs(zpow+diskbb)_. the free parameters in this model were @xmath5 , the normalizations where r is an `` apparent '' inner disk radius , d is the distance to the source , and @xmath46 is the angle of the disk ( @xmath46=0 implies face on ) . ] , and the temperature at the inner disk radius .",
    "this model also fit the data well ( table 2 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath47 and the disk temperature is @xmath48 kev .    a flat x - ray spectrum may also imply that the primary continuum is suppressed and the spectrum has a reflection component . however , as shown in figure 1 , the characteristic `` hump '' of the reflection model in the hard x - rays is not seen .",
    "sdss 1430@xmath90011 is also a type 1 agn , so unlikely to be completely dominated by a reflection component .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss this model in details .",
    "as discussed below , it is clear that the intrinsic spectrum of the source is not flat as inferred from the data . the data ,",
    "however , can not distinguish among different complex models ; fitting models that are not physically motivated is , therefore , avoided .",
    "moreover , the utility of reflection models to infer underlying physical parameters is limited by the unknown geometry of the reflector ( murphy & yaqoob 2009 ) .",
    "as discussed above , the three models listed in table 2 fit the data well . the correct model of the spectrum of sdss j1430 - 0011 should also be consistent with the data . in the disk black body model ,",
    "even the high energy power - law is as steep @xmath49 , much steeper than the @xmath33 derived from the data and there is the black body excess at low energies .",
    "thus , this model can not lead to an apparently flat spectrum during observation . indeed",
    "the best fit hr of this model is hr=@xmath50 , much softer than observed .",
    "for this reason , we do not discuss this model further .    to check the consistency with data for the other two acceptable models ( models 3 & 4 ) we calculate the predicted acis - s count rate over the 0.4 - 8.0 range and the corresponding hr",
    "; we then compare these parameters with observations .",
    "the models were produced in and then exported to the portable , interactive multi - mission simulator ( pimms ) software version 3.9 for predicting count rates and hr .",
    "for the best fit parameters , the predicted count rates are cr=0.022 for model 2 and cr=0.0228 for model 3 .",
    "these are higher than the observed count rate .",
    "a change in column density between the and observations can lead to such a change in the count rate .",
    "alternatively , the ionization parameter ( model 3 ) or the covering fraction ( model 4 ) could have been different . to investigate whether this is the case , we varied @xmath14 , @xmath51 , and @xmath35 in the subsequent analysis , while holding all other parameters of the models fixed .    in figure 5",
    "we have plotted hr as a function of @xmath14 for the partial covering model .",
    "the dotted lines are the predictions for a range of @xmath51 as indicated .",
    "the thick solid regions on each curve correspond to 90% confidence intervals for @xmath14 .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines define the 1@xmath52 confidence interval of the hr .",
    "as can be clearly seen from the figure , the best fit values of @xmath14 and @xmath51 are inconsistent with the data .",
    "the best fit value of covering fraction is inconsistent with data for any @xmath14 .",
    "covering fraction between about 90%95% , together with the best fit column density are consistent with the data .",
    "however , the predicted count rate for the @xmath53 model is cr=0.019 , still above the observed value . on the other hand , if @xmath54 , then the predicted cr=0.012 , as observed .",
    "thus , if a power - law with a partially covering absorber is the correct description of the source spectrum , then the covering fraction must have changed from 0.95 to 0.72 between and observations .    in figure 6 , we present a similar plot for the ionized absorber model .",
    "the dotted curves are for a range of @xmath35 values , as labeled .",
    "the dark solid lines encompasses the 90% confidence range of @xmath14 while the blue solid lines correspond to the parameter space consistent with observed cr .",
    "again , the best fit values of @xmath35 and @xmath14 do not match the data .",
    "for the best fit @xmath55 , higher values of @xmath14 , between @xmath56 match the hr as well as cr . for the observed @xmath14",
    ", the ionization parameter will have to be as low as @xmath57 to match the data .",
    "thus , if an ionized absorber model is the correct description of the target spectrum , the column density had to be higher , or the ionization parameter had to be lower , during the observation .",
    "the target of our observations , sdss j141430 - 0011 , showed an unusually flat spectrum and low luminosity during observations .",
    "the observations showed that the spectrum is complex ; it can be well described by an ionized absorber model or with a partially covering absorber model .",
    "the best fit power - law slopes in both cases were steeper ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) respectively .",
    "thus the intrinsic power - law slope of the source is not flat .",
    "the apparent faintness and spectral flatness during the observation can be explained if the covering fraction during the observation was higher than that found during the observation if the partial covering model is correct .",
    "alternatively , if the ionized absorber model is correct , then either the absorber column density was higher or the ionization parameter was lower during observations .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the source , however , is still low even after proper modeling of the spectrum . with l(220 kev)@xmath60 erg s@xmath2 , sdss j1430",
    "- 0011 falls below the grupe ( 2004 ) relation between x - ray power - law slope and luminosity . it s eddington luminosity ratio is also low @xmath61 for a black hole mass of @xmath62 calculated using h@xmath0 line width , luminosity and the scaling relations and assuming that the bolometric luminosity is about @xmath63l(210 kev )",
    ". it still falls below the w04 relation between optical and x - ray luminosity of rass detected sample .      given all its properties , it s worth asking if sdss 1430 - 0011 is a _ bona fide _",
    "nls1 galaxy .",
    "as discussed in  1 , bian , cui & chao ( 2006 ) argue that it is not a nls1 .",
    "these authors arrived at this conclusion by separating the narrow components of the h@xmath0 line from the broad component and found that the width of the broad component is about 2800 km s@xmath2 .",
    "they modeled the narrow component based on the [ oiii ] lines .",
    "it was found that the [ oiii ] lines show blue asymmetry , a quality more often found in nls1s than in bls1s ( mathur 2000 ; komossa & xu 2007 ) .",
    "it is useful , therefore , to examine other properties of this galaxy and compare them with the distributions found for nls1s and bls1s .",
    "the s / n in the sdss spectrum is low , but the high ionization `` coronal '' lines of fe vii @xmath64 and fe x @xmath65 are possibly detected in the optical spectrum .",
    "nls1s , with their steep x - ray spectra often show strong coronal lines ( e.g. pfieffer et al .",
    "the observed x - ray power - law slope is @xmath5=22.3 ( 90% confidence range ) for model 3 and 2.52.9 for model 4 .",
    "this is consistent with the range found for optically selected nls1s of w04 .",
    "it is also consistent with the range of x - ray selected bls1s in grupe et al .",
    "the feii / h@xmath0 ratio of the source is @xmath66 .",
    "this lies in the overlapping region between the peaks of nls1s and bls1s in the distribution found by grupe et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . at high x - ray luminosities ,",
    "nls1s typically show steeper spectra than bls1s .",
    "but at low luminosities , as observed for our source , both nls1s and bls1s have @xmath67 ( grupe 2004 ; their figure 7 ) .",
    "thus it appears that sdss 1430 - 0011 is at border line between nls1s and bls1s .",
    "sdss 1430 - 0011 , however , is not alone in this `` in - between '' classification .",
    "iras 13349 + 2438 ( gallo 2006 ) also has fwhm(h@xmath0)@xmath68 km s@xmath2 , though its other properties are similar to nls1s .",

    "mrk 335 ( grupe et al .",

    "this in - between state can be temporary in some cases , but there are also sources which usually occupy this region . sometimes , it manifests itself as a flat x - ray spectrum ( e.g. sdss 1430 - 0011 ) , sometimes as complex hard x - ray spectrum ( c.f .",
