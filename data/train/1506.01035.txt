    "this is especially the case when one considers the impact of field - to - field variations ( `` cosmic variance '' ) which is as large as a factor of two across the candels fields , e.g. , see figure 14 from bouwens et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and may be even larger for the brightest sources ( bowler et al .  2015 ; roberts - borsani et al .",
    "clearly , we require many independent lines of sight on the @xmath3 - 10 universe to average over the large - scale structure .",
    "unfortunately , the frontier fields initiative will not significantly help with this issue for luminous sources , given the limited area covered by observations from this program .",
    "nevertheless , there is a huge quantity of _ hst _ and _ spitzer _ data already available that can be used to construct larger samples of bright @xmath16 - 10 galaxies .",
    "the most significant of these data sets are the @xmath0500 arcmin@xmath1 candels uds , cosmos , and egs fields which feature very deep optical , near - ir , and _ spitzer_/irac observations .",

    "fortunately , we can overcome the aforementioned limitations of the candels uds , cosmos , and egs data sets by leveraging essentially all existing observations over these fields ( table  [ tab : dataset ] ) to first identify the highest probability @xmath3 - 10 candidates over these fields and then obtaining targeted follow - up observations of these candidates at @xmath51 m to determine which are likely at @xmath14 ( figure  [ fig : b9fig ] ) . in cycle 21 , we successfully proposed for such a follow - up program of plausible candidate @xmath3 - 10 galaxies over the candels uds , cosmos , and egs fields .",

    "through comparison with the volume density of fainter sources , the present search results also allow us to constrain the overall shape of the @xmath8 lf .",

    "in addition , this figure presents the redshift likelihood distribution we would expect , assuming these candidates are not detected in the single orbit of follow - up @xmath46-band observations from the z9-candels program .",
    "all 12 candidates show similar @xmath94 $ ] colors ( see also wilkins et al .",

    "a detailed fit to its sed suggests that it is actually a star - forming galaxy at @xmath226 .",
    "its inclusion in our original sample of @xmath191 candidate galaxies occurred due to its measured @xmath83 color , which was likely redder than reality due to the impact of noise . +",
    "* cos910 - 2 : * cos910 - 2 is detected at @xmath227 in the @xmath46-band follow - up observations .",
    "such a detection is not expected if the galaxy is actually at @xmath52 , and so the source must have a redshift of @xmath228 .",
    "it may correspond to either a @xmath229 or a @xmath137 galaxy . + * cos910 - 3 : * follow - up of cos910 - 2 in the @xmath46-band and the @xmath22-band ( 1/3 of an orbit ) shows a @xmath230 detection at @xmath51 m and @xmath99 detection in the @xmath22 band .",
    "perhaps , most importantly , the deeper photometry over the source in the @xmath22 band confirms that the source has a @xmath231 color of 1.25 mag . while this is consistent with the source having a redshift of the @xmath232 , one would not expect to detect the source at @xmath99 in the @xmath21 band in this case .",
    "these results suggest that the apparent break in the spectrum at @xmath233 m is not especially sharp and this source shows faint but detectable flux to much bluer wavelengths . + * uds910 - 0 : * follow - up of uds910 - 0 in the @xmath46 band shows a @xmath234 detection at @xmath51 m .",
    "therefore , this source can not plausibly correspond to a @xmath54 galaxy .",
    "the best - fit redshift we compute for the source is @xmath207 . like cos910 - 0 ,",
    "its inclusion in our sample of @xmath3 - 10 galaxies likely occurred as a result of noise in the measured @xmath83 color . +",
    "* egs910 - 1 : * follow - up of egs910 - 1 in the @xmath46-band shows a @xmath225 detection at @xmath51 m , consistent with a redshift of @xmath114 .",
    "+ * egs910 - 4 : * follow - up of egs910 - 4 in the @xmath46-band shows a @xmath225 detection at @xmath51 m , consistent with a redshift of @xmath114 . +",
    "* egs910 - 5 : * follow - up of egs910 - 5 in the @xmath46-band shows a @xmath235 detection at @xmath51 m , strongly suggesting it is not at @xmath14 .",
    "+ * egs910 - 6 : * egs910 - 6 is detected at 4.5@xmath18 in our @xmath46-band follow - up observations at @xmath51 m , providing clear evidence it is at @xmath114 .",
    "a @xmath114 solution is preferred at 99.8% confidence ( figure  [ fig : sed_notconf ] ) . +",
    "* egs910 - 7 : * follow - up of egs910 - 7 in the @xmath46-band only shows a @xmath236 detection at @xmath51 m .",
    "however , the @xmath94 $ ] color is sufficiently red that it seems more consistent with a lower - redshift galaxy than a @xmath14 galaxy .",
    "the nature of this source is unclear .",
    "when putting together a compilation of the most promising @xmath3 - 10 candidates to target with follow - up _ hst _ observations , we experimented with a variety of different procedures to identify possible @xmath3 - 10 galaxy candidates . as a result , we identified a larger number of possible @xmath17 - 10 galaxy candidates than we could thoroughly follow up with the 11 orbits allocated to our _ hst _ program .    while the redshift likelihood distributions we derived for these candidates suggested that the vast majority of them likely corresponded to sources at @xmath114 , it is nevertheless possible that several of these candidates might have redshifts in excess of @xmath137 .",
    "we provide a short list of the `` lower - probability '' @xmath3 - 10 galaxy candidates we identified over the candels cosmos , uds , and egs fields in table  [ tab : catalogex ] .",
