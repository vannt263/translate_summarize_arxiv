    "<S> highly accurate results are presented for the susceptibility , @xmath0 of the @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain for all temperatures , using the bethe ansatz and field theory methods . after going through a rounded peak , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 approaches its asympotic zero - temperature value with infinite slope .    in a pioneering work in 1964 , </S>",
    "<S> bonner and fisher estimated numerically@xcite the susceptibility , @xmath0 for the @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain , using chain lengths of up to 11 . </S>",
    "<S> the exact value at @xmath2 was obtained using the bethe ansatz@xcite . since that time </S>",
    "<S> , the bonner - fisher curve has frequently been used by experimentalists to determine the value of the exchange coupling , @xmath3 , and to determine whether or not a given material has sufficiently small anisotropic exchange and inter - chain couplings to be approximated by this model . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has become possible to calculate this curve much more accurately , using the bethe ansatz.@xcite this method easily gives very accurate results for @xmath4 not too small , but becomes increasingly difficult as @xmath5 . on the other hand , an analytic formula can be derived for @xmath0 at small @xmath4 , from conformal field theory methods . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps surprisingly , this formula predicts , due to the marginally irrelevant operator , that the susceptibility has infinite slope at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> here we present results for @xmath0 obtained using the bethe ansatz for @xmath6 and compare them to the conformal field theory prediction , obtaining excellent agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the field theory prediction for the general @xmath7 model is also given . </S>",
    "<S> figure ( 1 ) shows the susceptibility obtained from the bethe ansatz and figure ( 2 ) compares this result to the field theory prediction at low @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , with decreasing @xmath4 , after passing through the maximum , @xmath8 , at @xmath9 , the slope of @xmath10 starts to _ increase _ below the inflection point at @xmath11 , approaching @xmath12 as @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the heisenberg hamiltonian is written : @xmath13 the susceptibility per site is given by : @xmath14 the low energy effective field theory description@xcite is given by the @xmath15 wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) non - linear @xmath16-model , or equivalently a free , massless boson , with an effective `` velocity of light '' or spin - wave velocity : @xmath17 this value of @xmath18 is determined from the slope of the dispersion relation obtained from the bethe ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> the uniform part of the spin density is given by the conserved current operators , @xmath19 , @xmath20 for left and right - movers : @xmath21 in the wzw model @xmath19 and @xmath22 are uncorrelated and their self - correlations are given by : @xmath23 this result can be extended to finite temperature by a conformal transformation . </S>",
    "<S> this simply replaces : @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility in the wzw model is thus given by : @xmath26^{-2 } \\ + \\   </S>",
    "<S> \\left[\\frac{v\\beta}{\\pi } \\sin\\left(\\frac{(v\\tau -ix)\\pi}{v\\beta}\\right)\\right]^{-2 } \\right\\}\\ ] ] the integral can be done by the change of variables : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , giving : @xmath29 note that the integral is independent of @xmath30 or @xmath31 as it should be since the total spin is conserved . plugging in the spin - wave velocity , @xmath32 , </S>",
    "<S> gives the zero - temperature susceptibility , @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath0 is independent of @xmath4 in the wzw model follows from scale invariance . to obtain the leading @xmath4-dependence </S>",
    "<S> , we must perturb about the scale invariant fixed point hamiltonian with the leading irrelevant operator . </S>",
    "<S> this perturbation is written : @xmath34 this term is marginally irrelevant for the coupling constant , @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to calculate the correction to @xmath0 to first order in @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> expanding @xmath37 to first order the correction to @xmath10 involves four current operators . due to the fact that the left and right currents are uncorrelated , </S>",
    "<S> this expression factorizes into a product of two two - point green s functions , one for left - movers and one for right - movers . using translational invariance , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial integrals factorize into two independent integrals of the form of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ int ] ) , giving : @xmath38 again , the correction is naively temperature - independent , since @xmath39 is dimensionless . </S>",
    "<S> however , this formula can be improved by replacing @xmath39 by @xmath40 , the effective renormalized coupling at temperature @xmath4 . by integrating the lowest order @xmath41 -function , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 is given by:@xcite @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the value of the effective coupling at some temperature @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath43 and @xmath40 must be small for this formula to be valid . </S>",
    "<S> we may write this more compactly , as : @xmath45 for some temperature @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the asympotic behaviour at small @xmath4 becomes independent of @xmath43 or @xmath46 up to a correction of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect higher order corrections to @xmath0 of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc . by shifting @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> , we can eliminate the @xmath50 part of the @xmath48 correction . </S>",
    "<S> thus we obtain the leading @xmath4-dependence of @xmath10 : @xmath51 this formula is universal in the sense that if we add additional interactions to the heisenberg hamiltonian that respect the @xmath52 and translational symmetry and are not sufficiently large as to drive it into another phase , then this formula applies for some values of @xmath18 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if we add an antiferromagnetic second nearest neighbour interaction , @xmath53 , the value of the bare coupling , @xmath39 , decreases and reaches zero at @xmath54 . at this point all logarithmic terms in @xmath0 vanish , corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath56 should be analytic near @xmath2 . for larger @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> the system develops a gap and @xmath0 vanishes exponentially as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chiv ] ) should be valid for arbitrary half - integer spin heisenberg antiferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> for the ordinary @xmath1 heisenberg model , @xmath57 giving : @xmath58 a good fit to the bethe ansatz data is obtained with @xmath59 , as shown in figure ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chi ] ) is valid to within 2% for @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> similar formulas for the finite - size dependent of low energy states were obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( ) with @xmath61 replaced by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the size of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the role of infrared cut - off on the renormalization of the coupling constant is played by either the length , @xmath63 or an effective thermal length @xmath64 in the two cases . </S>",
    "<S> note that the field theory calculation of the susceptibility is done in the limit @xmath65 whereas the finite - size spectrum calculations are done in the opposite limit @xmath66 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the space - imaginary time surface is an infinite length cylinder of circumference @xmath64 or @xmath63 respectively . by pushing all calculations to second order in @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> , predictions could be made relating the various values of the @xmath67 s for different energy levels and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we may use the deviation of @xmath0 and the energy levels from their asympototic values to define four different estimates of the effective coupling constant versus length . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet and triplet excited state estimates of the effective coupling , @xmath68 , only converge very slowly as @xmath69 , as we expect since , in general , all these quantities receive corrections at next order in @xmath39 . surprisingly , the susceptibility and triplet estimates of @xmath39 , using the relationship @xmath70 , appear to converge much more rapidly as @xmath71 , suggesting the absence of corrections to any finite order in @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> [ the groundstate and triplet estimates appear to converge rapidly to a small non - zero difference . </S>",
    "<S> this remains a puzzlingly descrepancy between conformal field theory and bethe ansatz calculations . </S>",

    "<S> we now consider the general @xmath7 model : @xmath72.\\ ] ] for @xmath73 , the hamiltonian has a nel ordered groundstate and a gap . </S>",
    "<S> hence the susceptibility vanishes exponentially at low @xmath4 . for @xmath74 , </S>",
    "<S> the system remains gapless . </S>",
    "<S> it is now convenient to use abelian bosonization , involving a free boson @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath76 component becomes : @xmath77.\\ ] ] the other components of the interaction become : @xmath78 the @xmath76 part is exactly marginal and has the effect of rescaling the boson:@xcite @xmath79 with @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the other part then becomes : @xmath81 this has scaling dimension @xmath82 and is irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> it is the leading irrelevant operator , provided @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> a renormalization of the velocity also occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the zero temperature susceptibility gets rescaled to : @xmath84 the first order contribution to the susceptibility from @xmath85 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the second order contribution is determined by a standard scaling argument , giving : @xmath86 again this formula is universal in the sense that the two parameters @xmath18 and @xmath87 determine all low energy features of the model and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> increasing anisotropy leads to decreasing @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chianis ] ) should apply for arbitrary half - integer spin @xmath7 antiferromagnets in the gapless phase , provided that @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the exponent is replaced by @xmath89 . for the @xmath1 heisenberg model @xmath90 and @xmath91 have been determined from the bethe ansatz.@xcite letting : @xmath92 we find : @xmath93 thus @xmath94 ( in agreement with the explicit bethe ansatz calculation@xcite ) and the exponent is given by : @xmath95 for small anisotropy : @xmath96 @xmath0 has an infinite slope at @xmath2 for @xmath97 . for @xmath98 , </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath99 is replaced by @xmath89 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results may prove useful in experimental studies of quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we may define a `` critical region '' where the temperature dependence is governed by the leading irrelevant operator so that eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chiv ] ) or ( [ chianis ] ) hold . for the isotropic heisenberg model , this critical region </S>",
    "<S> can be identified approximately as @xmath100 , below the inflection point . </S>",
    "<S> only if the nel temperature , determined by interchain couplings , is below this value can the one dimensional critical behaviour be observed . </S>"
