    "the dominant mechanism for producing plastic strain in most crystalline materials is the collective motion of interacting dislocations .",
    "although the gliding of an individual dislocation produces a finite slip localized at its glide plane , the plastic response of a macroscopic specimen , due to the huge number of dislocations , is usually smooth in time and space , resembling a viscous flow process .",
    "consequently , mechanical properties , like the yield stress , are not dependent on the specimen size or shape .",
    "it was realized , however , that as soon as the size of the specimen is decreased to around 10 @xmath0 m in at least one direction , this picture is not valid any more : the deformation process becomes inhomogeneous both in time and space .",
    "this was recently demonstrated on cylindrical ni single crystals ( micropillars ) fabricated using a focused ion beam ( fib ) @xcite .",
    "these breakthrough experiments showed that if the pillar diameter drops below 40 @xmath0 m then the stress - strain curve becomes visibly irregular with random steps appearing on it .",
    "this phenomenon is accompanied by a strong size effect , i.e. ,  the small samples become much harder than the bulk material @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is analogous to the hall - petch relation of polycrystalline materials @xcite or the increased strength of thin metallic films @xcite . during the past few years",
    "microtesting experiments were carried out on a wide range of face - centered cubic ( fcc ) @xcite and body - centered cubic ( bcc ) metals @xcite and in all cases similar behaviour was found ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "another related important observation was the realization that the strain burst events ( dislocation avalanches ) associated with the steps on the stress - strain curves follow a scale - free size distribution .",
    "this was first demonstrated by acoustic emission experiments on ice @xcite , cd , zn-0.08%al and cu single crystals @xcite .",
    "later , direct measurement of the strain jumps on ni micropillars @xcite as well as computer simulations @xcite yielded the same result .",
    "it was also found that the spatial arrangement of dislocation avalanches has a fractal character @xcite and that the surface profile of deformed copper crystals develops self - affine roughness over several orders of magnitude in scale @xcite .",
    "these observations clearly demonstrate that plasticity is a critical - like phenomenon with avalanche dynamics and , therefore , shows analogy to sand piles , magnetic domains in ferromagnets or tectonic plates @xcite .",
    "this scale - free behaviour is quite general : it is present regardless of the actual material , crystal structure , orientation and loading mode .",
    "this robustness suggests that critical behaviour is conditioned on some very basic properties of dislocations , like the long - range elastic interactions . based upon these observations",
    "it was proposed that dislocation systems undergo a second order depinning - like phase transition at the yield stress , and the different scale - free characteristics stem from the closeness to the critical point of yielding @xcite .",
    "it needs to be mentioned , however , that recent numerical studies on two - dimensional dislocation systems suggest a different picture , namely , scale - free behaviour is not only observed at yielding , but arises already at stresses much below the yield stress @xcite .    due to the large strain fluctuations emerging at small scales the stress - strain curves of micron- and sub - micron scale specimens are of random character in several aspects .",
    "the step - like curves consist of plateaus corresponding to strain bursts , and stress jumps connecting these plateaus",
    ". both the size of strain bursts and stress jumps are probabilistic variables , following a power - law @xcite and a weibull distribution @xcite , respectively .",
    "consequently , the stress value at a given strain is also of stochastic nature . in particular",
    ", the yield stress of the micropillars differs from sample to sample .",
    "its value is usually defined as the stress at a predefined level of plastic strain @xmath1 ( e.g.  @xcite ) or the stress at the onset of the first large / detectable strain burst ( e.g.  @xcite ) . on the basis of _ in situ _",
    "laue diffraction analysis the so called laue - yield point was also introduced for micropillars where internal lattice rotations are initially observed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding stress is usually below the yield stress values of the previous two methods .",
    "two remarks have to be made at this point : ( i ) the yield stress defined by each of these methods varies from sample to sample and ( ii ) the different methods yield different yield stress values for the same pillar .",
    "this raises an intriguing problem regarding the picture of yielding as a critical phenomenon .",
    "if there is a well - defined critical point ( yield stress ) as suggested , one should be able to give instructions how to detect it experimentally .",
    "its value should not depend on arbitrarily chosen parameters ( like the @xmath1 ) or the sensitivity of the testing machine ( when one detects the first strain burst ) . but how to define then a yield stress of a pillar , that exhibits stochastic plastic response ?",
    "our proposition is , that such a threshold stress level can only be defined in a probabilistic way over an ensemble of specimens with the same parameters ( size , dislocation density , etc . )",
    "@xcite . according to the analysis of a large ensemble of discrete dislocation dynamics simulations of ispnovity et al .",
    "@xcite several corroborating quantities mark an average characteristic stress level , where average plastic strain and strain fluctuations begin to increase rapidly .",
    "the posed question has an important technological aspect , too .",
    "the trend of miniaturizing mechanical devices has led to their scale to reach the micron range and below .",
    "the unpredictable fluctuations associated with micron - scale plasticity make design of such structures difficult , if not impossible .",
    "obviously , the traditional deterministic methods of continuum plasticity fail to give useful answers at this scale . for a proper failure assessment ,",
    "first , the stochastic properties of micron - scale plasticity need to be understood in sufficient detail @xcite .    in this paper , therefore",
    ", we aim at giving an in - depth statistical description of micron - scale plastic response . to this end ,",
    "compression tests are carried out on a large number of pure cu single crystalline micropillars .",
    "these pillars exhibit the same crystallographic orientation and close to identical geometry so they in principle only differ in the inherent initial realization of the dislocation structure . to test the robustness of our results , two- ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) discrete dislocation simulations",
    "are also carried out .",
    "the aim of applying these simulation methods is not to give a quantitative validation of the experiments , but by studying the observed phenomena in idealized and simplified situations to identify the possible relevant physical processes .",
    "this wide toolbox allows us to highlight features that do not depend on specific details of the material or simulation , but on general aspects of dislocation plasticity . throughout this paper , due to experimental and computational constraints ,",
    "only one system size is studied with each method .",
    "consequently , understanding size - effects can not be in our scope .",
    "instead , we focus on a size regime where collective dislocation dynamics is expected to play an important role and effects of surface - controlled mechanisms are supposed to be weak .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : methods ] description of the models used in the simulations is given followed by the details of the simulation procedures and parameters .",
    "then the experimental methods of micropillar fabrication and compression are summarized . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the results of the different statistical analyses are presented for the three different methods . section [ sec : discussion ] presents discussion and sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] summarizes the main results and concludes the paper .",
    "first , a conceptually simple model is considered that consists of parallel edge dislocations with parallel glide planes .",
    "this system is fully represented in a plane perpendicular to the dislocation lines , thus it is effectively two - dimensional . for the dislocation motion",
    "overdamped dynamics are assumed , that is , the velocity is proportional to the acting force per unit length .",
    "let the system consist of @xmath2 dislocations at positions @xmath3 in the 2d representation with burgers vectors of equal magnitude @xmath4 . without any loss of generality burgers vectors",
    "are taken parallel to the @xmath5 axis @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the _ sign _ of the @xmath8th dislocation . with these notations",
    "the equation of motion of the dislocations read as @xmath9\\!;\\ \\dot{y}_i = 0 .",
    "\\quad ( i=1 .. n ) , \\label{eqn : eq_mot}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the dislocation drag coefficient , @xmath11 is the applied external shear stress and @xmath12 denotes the shear stress field generated by an edge dislocation . for the latter we use the solution corresponding to linear isotropic media @xcite : @xmath13 with @xmath0 and @xmath14 being the shear modulus and the poisson s ratio , respectively .",
    "a square - shaped simulation area is considered with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) to mimic an infinite system . as a result of the pbc , due to the introduced image dislocations",
    ", the stress interaction corresponding to infinite boundary conditions also has to be made periodic .",
    "this procedure is performed by a fourier method described in detail in @xcite . during the simulation",
    "small dislocation dipoles of opposite sign with distance less than 5% of the average dislocation spacing are annihilated .",
    "this method speeds up the simulations considerably , but , on the other hand , it is not expected to affect the dynamics of the system , since short dipoles do not generate long - range stress fields , thus their dynamics is effectively decoupled from the rest of the system @xcite .",
    "this model is a strong simplification of real dislocation networks found in crystals .",
    "it can not account for , e.g. ,  dislocation multiplication , forest hardening , cross - slip , dislocation junction formation and so on .",
    "nonetheless , such models proved to be very useful in studying general features of dislocation dynamics .",
    "for example , it was successfully applied to study andrade creep @xcite , dislocation avalanche dynamics @xcite , subgrain formation at high temperatures @xcite and the effect of elastic anharmonicity on the dislocation pattern formation @xcite .",
    "a similar 2d model was used recently to study the micro - plastic regime of the stress - strain curve @xcite and with the inclusion of additional rules on , e.g. ,  multiplication , even as complex problems as micropillar deformation @xcite or plastic properties of metal matrix composites @xcite can be studied .",
    "the reason for this is that , despite of the strong simplifications , the model still contains some very basic properties of dislocation systems : ( i ) that dislocation motion is constrained to a glide plane , ( ii ) that dislocation stress fields are long - range and ( iii ) that dislocation motion is of highly dissipative nature .",
    "so one of the main aims of using these 2d models is to understand the role of these fundamental ingredients .",
    "the simulation of a loading experiment is performed as follows .",
    "initially , an equal number of positive and negative sign dislocations are placed randomly with uniform distribution in the simulation area .",
    "then the system is let to relax at zero applied stress , that is , eq .  ( [ eqn : eq_mot ] ) is solved parallelly for each dislocation with @xmath15 .",
    "once the system has reached its equilibrium state ( an example seen in fig .  [ fig:2d](a ) ) we start slowly increasing the external shear stress in a quasistatic manner .",
    "the latter means that during the loading procedure the dislocation activity is continuously monitored by the average absolute dislocation velocity @xmath16 , and whenever it exceeds a predefined threshold value @xmath17 ( a dislocation avalanche is setting on ) the external shear stress is kept constant .",
    "if later on @xmath18 decreases below @xmath17 , that is , the avalanche has finished , then the external stress is increased again with a constant rate . in the illustrative sketch of fig .",
    "[ fig:2d](b ) it is seen that the threshold value @xmath17 unambiguously determines the avalanches , since there is more than two orders of magnitude between the typical @xmath18 values for the quiescent and active states .",

    "the applied stress during an avalanche is constant leading to a deformation curve consisting of horizontal strain jumps connected by nearly vertical stress steps ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2d](c ) ) .",
    "since there is no dislocation multiplication in the model , at a certain stress level the system enters an infinite avalanche , that is , a flowing state .",
    "one of the main advantages of 2d dislocation modelling is its speed and accuracy compared to more complex methods . in the current implementation the numerical noise was negligible , yet , the simulation of a large ensemble consisting of 545 different configurations was possible .",
    "this large ensemble and the high accuracy leads to exceptionally reliable results .      a more realistic representation of a dislocation network is considered here , by introducing curved dislocation lines and crystallographic slip systems .",

    "these curves are of random nature , that is , one ( or few ) of them does not fully represent the plastic properties for the actual parameters ( system size , crystal orientation , etc . ) . given that in this study a large number of such curves are available for each method , in this chapter an in - depth statistical analysis of these curves is carried out in order to provide a more complete picture of the underlying micron - scale plastic behaviour .",

    "( note , that ( i ) the stress and strain axes were switched to express the fact , that the system was driven by the applied stress and ( ii ) in the 2d case the applied stress and plastic strain are denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath50 , respectively , to emphasize that these correspond to pure shear values . )     +    ( 0,0 ) ( -245,147 ) ( 13,147 )     +   +    ( 0,0 ) ( -116,147 )    the three plots exhibit common features :    1",

    "so , the fact that the previous results were recovered clearly indicates , that this behaviour is not dependent on fine details of the material and/or loading set - up .",

    "@xmath58 is approximately constant in the studied plastic strain regime , but @xmath59 monotonously increases . on the other hand , for micropillars",
    "studied experimentally @xmath58 is increased with strain , and @xmath59 does not vary ( this is manifested in the overlap in fig .",
    "[ fig : weibull_pillar](b ) ) .",
    "these differences might be related to the different behaviour of the dislocation density .",
    "namely , the dislocation density is approximately constant in the simulations ( there are no sources in 2d and in 3d dislocation creation is balanced by the leave of dislocations through specimen surface ) , and , according to norfleet _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , it increases significantly in the case of experimentally studied micropillars .",
    "however , further experimental and modelling studies are required to address this issue in more detail .",
    "according to the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : avg_def_curves ] a threshold stress level @xmath53 can be defined on the average stress - plastic strain curves in all three studied cases .",
    "this point exhibits features that are characteristic for yielding .",
    "first , there is a microplastic regime below @xmath53 where there is some plastic strain , but @xmath42 starts to increase rapidly only above this threshold stress @xmath53 .",
    "this microplastic regime is characterized by a power - law as @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "this means , that the stress - plastic strain curve has an infinite slope at @xmath61 , as expected and that some non - negligible plastic strain is observed everywhere below @xmath53 , in line with the recent _ in situ _ laue micro - diffraction experiments of maa _ et al . _  performed on ni micropillars under compression @xcite .",
    "second , the variance of the plastic strain also increases faster above @xmath53 , suggesting that the system enters a statistically different regime above @xmath53 .",
    "note , that although the average stress - plastic strain curves of the studied systems look similar , the stress and strain values at the observed knees are quite different .",
    "this is far from unexpected , since the yield stress is known to depend on several parameters of the system like size , dislocation density , orientation , etc .",
    "in addition , there are inherent differences in the studied models themselves , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] .",
    "for instance , in the 2d model there are no forest dislocations at all and multiplication is also absent . in the 3d simulations ,",
    "the orientation and the specimen size are also different from those in the experiments .",
    "the initial configuration of randomly positioned frank - read sources may also have an influence on the plastic response because in this artificial configuration initially there are no dislocations that could leave the volume at small applied stresses . for significant plastic strain to occur",
    ", at least one frank - read source needs to be activated .",
    "so in this case , the plastic strain corresponding to the yield stress is expected to be smaller than for pillars ( where one expects a pronounced microplastic regime ) , and the yield stress is expected to depend on the initial parameters of the frank - read sources like their average length . indeed , according to figs .",
    "[ fig : avg_stress_strain](b ) and ( c ) , the plastic strain at @xmath53 is more than one order of magnitude smaller for the 3d ddd simulations than for the pillar experiments .",
    "in addition , the knee on the stress - strain curve at @xmath53 for 2d ddd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avg_stress_strain](a ) ) is not as sharp as for the other methods .",
    "we speculate that this is caused by the absence of some processes that are active in 3d , like dislocation multiplication or dislocation reactions .    in conclusion",
    ", it seems to be a general feature that a threshold stress level @xmath53 exists in the average sense , which acts as a yield stress .",
    "although it is always present , its value is not general at all , it is affected by the fine details of the set - up , like the orientation , statistical properties of the dislocation network and so on , as expected for a yield stress .",
    "these observations , therefore , support that @xmath53 acts as an average yield stress .",
    "it needs to be stressed , that in this paper the question of whether @xmath53 corresponds to a critical point and/or scale - free behaviour has not been addressed . as it was mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there are still fundamental unresolved issues regarding the nature of criticality during plastic deformation .",
    "before the physical meaning of @xmath53 in this phenomenon could be better understood , those open issues need to be solved .      in sec .",
    "[ sec : stress_statistics ] it was shown that the stress values corresponding to a given plastic strain follow weakest link statistics of weibull type .",
    "the idea , that plasticity of micron- or submicron - scale pillars is influenced by a weakest element mechanism has been introduced already in the literature .",
    "first , norfleet et al .",
    "made such a suggestion based on tem investigations of deformed ni pillars with diameters of 1 - 20 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "later , this proposition was further elaborated by 3d ddd simulations of el - awady _ et al . _",
    "the first quantitative analysis was performed by senger _",
    "et al . _",
    "using 3d ddd simulations @xcite .",
    "in that study the distribution of flow stress values ( corresponding to 0.2% of plastic strain ) were determined for various pillar sizes , orientation and aspect ratios .",
    "it was found , that these stress values are weibull - distributed with weibull - exponents varying between 4.0 and 20.4 depending on the size , orientation and aspect ratio .",
    "the result was attributed to the fact , that in small pillars there are only a few practically non - interacting frank - read sources , and plasticity onsets when the resolved shear stress reaches the activation stress of the weakest source .",
    "remarkably , similar stress distribution was found by rinaldi _",
    "et al . _  on nanocrystalline ni pillars with diameters @xmath62 nm @xcite .",
    "the stress values corresponding to the first , second , etc .",
    "detected strain jump were also found to be weibull - distributed , with weibull - exponents in the range @xmath63 . in our case , however , the underlying mechanism involves collective dynamic effects so the fact that the stress values follow a weakest - link statistics is far from trivial .",
    "the mathematical origin of the weibull distribution is as follows . consider a chain of @xmath2 links with independent random failure strengths ( being identically distributed ) .",
    "the failure strength of the whole chain is then simply the failure strength of the weakest link . according to extreme value theory",
    ", if for the link strength cumulative distribution @xmath64 it holds that @xmath65 if @xmath66 ( @xmath58 is the lower bound of the support ) and for small loads above @xmath58 it scales as @xmath67 , then the corresponding extreme value distribution is the weibull distribution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : weibull ] ) with @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "so both @xmath58 and @xmath57 are characteristic of the individual links and not the whole chain , and @xmath59 is related to the number of the links in the system .    in the light of this background",
    "it is quite remarkable , that 2d plasticity , where dislocation sources do not even exist , can be described in terms of weibull distributions .",
    "this finding hints that the volume ( chain ) can be decomposed into weakly correlated sub - volumes ( links ) with a certain failure strength distribution . in this case , the weibull - exponent @xmath57 should not depend on the specimen size , and the stress scale @xmath59 should obey @xmath69 , with @xmath70 being the dimension of the chain network and @xmath71 the linear size of the system . in this case in the @xmath72 limit the distribution tends to a step function at @xmath58 , and , therefore , the average stress to @xmath58 . since on the macroscopic scale , the stress at a given @xmath42 has a well - defined non - zero value , if the above picture is valid , @xmath58 should significantly differ from zero .",
    "indeed , for 2d systems the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : weibull_2d](b ) would not be straight if @xmath58 was set to zero .",
    "so , according to the picture that has emerged , a 2d dislocation system can be envisaged approximately as a set of independent sub - regions of the system , and its yield stress obeys weakest link statistics .",
    "this finding is in line with the stochastic plasticity model of zaiser and moretti @xcite , that was successfully used to describe the effect of size , machine stiffness and hardening in avalanche dynamics @xcite , and more recently the role of the slow stress relaxation present in the material @xcite . in the model",
    "the simulation region is subdivided into cells , with independent local yield stresses .",
    "the argumentation for this assumption is as follows .",
    "according to numerical investigations , although dislocations exhibit long - range @xmath73 type stress fields , the emerging spatial correlation of the dislocations is short - range , with a correlation length in the range of the average dislocation spacing @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "it was shown theoretically that these correlations lead to the screening of the @xmath73 stress field in an analogous way to debye screening in electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the screened stress field decays faster than @xmath73 , so , on scales much above the correlation length , i.e.  the average dislocation spacing , the interactions between the dislocations are weak in equilibrium dislocation systems .",
    "thus , in the mesoscopic continuum model outlined above the cell size is chosen to exceed the average dislocation spacing .",
    "one of the most important findings of this paper is that the results presented suggest that this concept is valid in more complex situations of 3d ddd simulations and micropillar compression experiments .",
    "three different methods have been used to study micron - scale plasticity : 2d and 3d discrete dislocation dynamics and micropillar compression experiments .",
    "two important features have been unveiled that are characteristic for all cases : ( i ) both the average and the variance of plastic strain exhibit a crossover at the same threshold stress level , and ( ii ) the applied stresses corresponding to a plastic strain level follow weakest link statistics .",
    "this generality suggests that these features depend on some basic properties of dislocations . in the 2d model",
    "practically only the long - range interactions are included properly , so one might conclude that this is the most important ingredient .",
    "however , several properties , like the value of the suggested average yield stress or the shape of the average stress - plastic strain curve , seem to depend on underlying active dislocation mechanisms , like multiplication or dislocation reactions .",
    "as said in the paper , the introduced threshold stress is expected to depend on many parameters , like the sample size , dislocation density , orientation , etc .",
    "in addition , the fitted parameters of the weibull distributions might also depend on these quantities .",
    "the nature of these dependencies is an interesting issue and it could give a deeper insight into , e.g. , size effects . since such studies were out of the scope of the present paper ,",
    "they call for further experimental and modelling work in this field .",
