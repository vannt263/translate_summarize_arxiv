    "the classical moser theorem establishes that the total volume is the only invariant for a volume form on a compact connected manifold with respect to the diffeomorphism action . in this paper",
    "we prove a nonholonomic counterpart of this result and present its applications in the problems of nonholonomic optimal mass transport .",
    "the equivalence for the diffeomorphism action is often formulated in terms of  stability \" of the corresponding object : the existence of a diffeomorphism relating the initial object with a deformed one means that the initial object is stable , as it differs from the deformed one merely by a coordinate change .",
    "gray showed in @xcite that contact structures on a compact manifold are stable .",
    "moser @xcite established stability for volume forms and symplectic structures .",
    "a leafwise counterpart of moser s argument for foliations was presented by ghys in @xcite , while stability of symplectic - contact pairs in transversal foliations was proved in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we establish stability of volume forms in the presence of any bracket - generating distributions on connected compact manifolds : two volume forms of equal total volume on such a manifold can be isotoped by the flow of a vector field tangent to the distribution .",
    "we call this statement a nonholonomic moser theorem .",
    "recall that a distribution @xmath0 on the manifold @xmath1 is called _ bracket - generating _ , or _ completely nonholonomic _ ,",
    "if local vector fields tangent to @xmath0 and their iterated lie brackets span the entire tangent bundle of the manifold @xmath1 .",
    "nonholonomic distributions arise in various problems related to rolling or skating , wherever the  no - slip \" condition is present .",
    "for instance , a ball rolling over a table defines a trajectory in a configuration space tangent to a nonholonomic distribution of admissible velocities .",
    "note that such a ball can be rolled to any point of the table and stopped at any _ a priori _ prescribed position .",
    "the latter is a manifestation of the chow - rashevsky theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) : for a bracket - generating distribution @xmath0 on a connected manifold @xmath1 any two points in @xmath1 can be connected by a horizontal path ( i.e. a path everywhere tangent to the distribution @xmath0 ) .",
    "note that for an integrable distribution there is a foliation to which it is tangent and a horizontal path always stays on the same leaf of this foliation .",
    "furthermore , for an integrable distribution , the existence of an isotopy between volume forms requires an infinite number of conditions . on the contrary",
    ", the nonholonomic moser theorem shows that a non - integrable bracket - generating distribution imposes only one condition on total volume of the forms for the existence of the isotopy between them .",
    "closely related to the nonholonomic moser theorem is the existence of a nonholonomic hodge decomposition , and the corresponding properties of the subriemannian laplace operator , see section [ nonhodge ] .",
    "we also formulate the corresponding nonholonomic mass transport problem and describe its formal solutions as projections of horizontal geodesics on the diffeomorphism group for the @xmath2-carnot - caratheodory metric .    in order to give this description ,",
    "we first present the hamiltonian framework for what is now called the otto calculus - the riemannian submersion picture for the problems of optimal mass transport .",
    "it turns out that the submersion properties can be naturally understood as an infinite - dimensional hamiltonian reduction on diffeomorphism groups , and this admits a generalization to the nonholonomic setting .",
    "we define a nonholonomic analog of the wasserstein metric on the space of densities .",
    "finally , we extend otto s result on the heat equation and prove that the subriemannian heat equation defines a gradient flow on the nonholonomic wasserstein space with potential given by the boltzmann relative entropy functional .",
    "the main goal of this section is to prove the following nonholonomic version of the classical moser theorem . consider a distribution @xmath0 on a compact manifold @xmath1 ( without boundary unless otherwise stated ) .",

    "apparently , the most straightforward generalization of the classical moser theorem is its version  with parameters . \" in this case , volume forms on @xmath1 smoothly depend on parameters and have the same total volume at each value of this parameter : @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",

    "note that in this version the volume forms are given on the _ ambient _ manifold @xmath19 , while in the parametric version of the moser theorem we are given _ fiberwise _ volume forms .",
    "there is also a similar version of this theorem for a foliation , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite . in either case , for the corresponding diffeomorphism to exist the volume forms have to satisfy infinitely many conditions ( the equality of the total volumes as functions in the parameter @xmath16 or as the push - forwards @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
