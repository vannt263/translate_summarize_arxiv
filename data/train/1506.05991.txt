    "the study of ideals of linear operators between banach spaces , that is , families of operators that are closed under composition , has been an important tool in the study of banach spaces .",
    "a stellar example is that of @xmath0-summing operators , as attested to by the astonishing number of results and applications that can be found , for example , in @xcite . in recent years , a number of ideals of lipschitz maps ( which in particular , are generally nonlinear ) inspired by well - known and very useful ideals of linear operators between banach spaces have appeared in the literature .",
    "one example is the notion of lipschitz @xmath0-summing operators between metric spaces , a nonlinear generalization of @xmath0-summing operators , which was introduced by j. d. farmer and w. b. johnson in @xcite .",
    "other examples of such ideals of lipschitz maps are operators that admit a lipschitz factorization through an @xmath1 space @xcite , lipschitz @xmath0-nuclear and lipschitz @xmath0-integral operators @xcite , or operators admitting a lipschitz factorization through a subset of a hilbert space @xcite .",
    "if we restrict our attention to one of these ideals of maps from a fixed metric space to a fixed normed space , the resulting space of maps is itself a normed space .",
    "therefore , being able to identify the dual of such a space of maps would be interesting and useful .",
    "that is precisely one of the questions raised by farmer and johnson at the end of their paper for the specific case of lipschitz @xmath0-summing maps @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to develop a systematic approach to the duality theory for ideals of lipschitz maps from a metric space to a banach space , a generalization of the aforementioned question of farmer and johnson .",
    "this approach is inspired on one hand by the deep and useful connections between the theories of operator ideals and of tensor norms for banach spaces ( in the spirit of the book of a. defant and k. floret @xcite ) , and on the other by the solution by the second - named author to the problem of duality for lipschitz @xmath0-summing operators @xcite .",
    "the key idea in @xcite is the concept of spaces of banach - space - valued molecules , which plays the role of a sort of `` tensor product '' between a metric space and a banach space . in @xcite",
    "those spaces of molecules are endowed with certain lipschitz versions of the tensor norms of s. chevet @xcite and p. saphar @xcite , which are in canonical duality with spaces of lipschitz @xmath0-summing maps .",
    "it is worth noting that the use of tensor - product techniques in the research on the duality theory for lipschitz function spaces implicitly appears already in the works @xcite by j. a. johnson in the 70 s . in @xcite , we have formalized the notion of a lipschitz tensor product between a metric space and a normed space , and studied its basic properties . in the present paper",
    "we develop the duality theory that relates lipschitz tensor products and ideals of lipschitz maps , by answering the following two questions : given an ideal of lipschitz maps , when can it be canonically identified with the dual of a lipschitz tensor product ? given a lipschitz tensor product , when can its dual space be canonically identified with an ideal of lipschitz maps ?",
    "let us now describe the contents of this paper .",
    "section [ s1 ] gathers some preliminary results on the lipschitz tensor product @xmath2 between a metric space @xmath3 and a normed space @xmath4 , proved in the paper @xcite . in section [ alo ] we introduce and study the space @xmath5 of @xmath6-valued @xmath7-lipschitz operators defined on @xmath3 , that is , operators from @xmath3 to @xmath6 that induce a continuous functional on a given lipschitz tensor product with a cross - norm norm @xmath7 ( denoted by @xmath8 ) .",
    "the @xmath7-lipschitz operators are in fact lipschitz maps , which justifies the terminology .",
    "moreover , we show that several known examples of ideals of lipschitz maps  namely lipschitz maps , lipschitz @xmath0-summing maps and maps admitting a lipschitz factorization through a subset of an @xmath1 space  are associated to lipschitz cross - norms in this way .",
    "section [ alo2 ] addresses the duality theory for @xmath7-lipschitz operators and contains the main result of this paper : the space of @xmath6-valued @xmath7-lipschitz operators defined on @xmath3 is canonically isometrically isomorphic to the dual of the lipschitz tensor product @xmath8 .",
    "this canonical identification is the basis of our study of the duality for ideals of lipschitz maps . the section is completed by studying the several topologies on the space of @xmath6-valued @xmath7-lipschitz operators defined on @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the main questions we are pursuing in this paper can be rephrased as : when is the space of @xmath7-lipschitz operators an ideal ? given an ideal of lipschitz maps , when can it be represented as a space of @xmath7-lipschitz maps ?    in section [ frlo ]",
    "we take a small detour from the main theme of the paper to work out several results dealing with approximations .",
    "we show that under minimal assumptions on the cross - norm @xmath7 , the simplest ( that is , the so - called lipschitz finite - rank ) lipschitz operators from @xmath3 to @xmath6 are all @xmath7-lipschitz .",
    "we also study the lipschitz operators from @xmath3 into @xmath6 that are limits in the @xmath7-lipschitz norm of sequences of lipschitz finite - rank operators , which are called @xmath7-lipschitz approximable operators .    in section [ lobi ]",
    "we formalize the notion of ideals of lipschitz maps , which we have called banach ideals of lipschitz operators .",
    "we introduce these ideals and give some sufficient conditions and other necessary ones on @xmath5 and the space of @xmath7-lipschitz approximable operators to be such a banach ideal of lipschitz operators .    in section [ lobs ] , we look at spaces of maps from @xmath3 to @xmath6 which are not necessarily ideals but nevertheless are in duality with lipschitz cross - norms .",
    "we introduce the concept of lipschitz operator banach space , and give simple conditions on @xmath7 that characterize when @xmath5 is one such space .",
    "as was already mentioned , it is proved in section [ alo ] that if @xmath7 is a lipschitz cross - norm on @xmath2 , then @xmath5 can be identified with the dual of the space @xmath9 .",
    "we now prove a converse result , characterizing those lipschitz operator banach spaces that are canonically isometrically isomorphic to the dual of @xmath9 for some lipschitz cross - norm @xmath7 on @xmath2 ( in terms of the compactness of their unit balls with respect to one of the topologies introduced in section [ alo2 ] ) .    up to this point in the paper",
    ", we have only dealt with spaces of maps from a metric space to a dual banach space . in section [ rtmlobi ]",
    ", we study the relationship between lipschitz cross - norms and lipschitz operator banach ideals even in the case when the latter take values in a banach space which is not a dual space .",
    "the main result of this section is a lipschitz version of the representation theorem for maximal operator ideals @xcite , and we deduce some consequences of it including a general theorem that characterizes certain nonlinear maps by linear means ( theorem [ thm - linear - characterization - of - nonlinear ] ) .",
