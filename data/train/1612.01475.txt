    "a hyperuniform many - particle system is one in which the structure factor approaches zero in the infinite - wavelength limit.@xcite in such systems , density fluctuations ( measured by the variance of number of particles inside a spherical window ) are anomalously suppressed at very large lengths scales , a `` hidden '' order that imposes strong global structural constraints.@xcite all structurally perfect crystals and quasicrystals are hyperuniform,@xcite but typical disordered many - particle systems , including gases , liquids , and glasses , are not .",
    "disordered hyperuniform many - particle systems are exotic states of amorphous matter that have attracted considerable recent attention.@xcite materials that are simultaneously disordered and hyperuniform can be regarded to be exotic states of matter that lie between a crystal and a liquid ; they behave more like crystals in the manner in which they suppress large - scale density fluctuations , and yet they also resemble typical statistically isotropic liquids and glasses with no bragg peaks.@xcite    an important class of disordered hyperuniform many - particle systems is comprised of the classical ground states of `` stealthy potentials,''@xcite which are bounded , long - range , pairwise additive potentials designed in fourier space .",
    "these classical ground states are of particular fundamental interest because they can be degenerate and noncrystalline .",
    "a nonnegative parameter inversely proportional to the number density , @xmath0 , controls the degree of order of such ground states . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the ground states are overwhelmingly highly degenerate and disordered .",
    "as @xmath0 increases above 0.5 , long - range translational and rotational order begins to emerge and eventually the system crystallizes .",
    "we have previously studied these disordered ground states , and computed their pair correlation functions,@xcite structure factors,@xcite voronoi cell volume distribution,@xcite and particle - exclusion probabilities.@xcite    some initial studies have demonstrated that stealthy hyperuniform systems are endowed with novel thermodynamic and physical properties .",
    "for example , their low - temperature excited states are characterized by negative thermal expansion behavior.@xcite it has also been shown that dielectric networks derived from stealthy disordered hyperuniform point configurations possess complete photonic band gaps comparable in size to those of a photonic crystal , while at the same time maintain statistical isotropy , enabling waveguide geometries not possible with photonic crystals as well as high - density disordered transparent materials.@xcite however , the determination of physical / chemical properties of stealthy disordered hyperuniform materials is generally an unexplored area of research .    in this paper , we investigate steady - state and time - dependent diffusion properties of certain decorations of stealthy disordered hyperuniform ground - state point configurations in two and three dimensions .",
    "in particular , we derive two - phase heterogeneous media from point configurations by decorating the point configurations with spheres ( circles ) ; specifically , all points are circumscribed by spheres of radius @xmath2 that generally may overlap with one another . by varying the radius ,",
    "the fraction of space occupied by the spheres will vary .",
    "we study the effective transport properties of these disordered two - phase systems , including the effective diffusion coefficient,@xcite and static and time - dependent characteristics of diffusion - controlled reactions at the interfaces between the two continuous phases , as well as the trapping rate ( or its inverse , the mean survival time ) as well as the principal ( largest ) relaxation time.@xcite quantifying the effective diffusion coefficient is of importance not only because it has direct applications ( e.g. , diffusion of fuel and oxygen in a fuel cell @xcite , diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging , @xcite regulation and metabolism of normal organs , @xcite and drug release from porous matrices @xcite ) , but also because its determination translates immediately into equivalent results for the effective thermal and electric conductivity , the effective dielectric constant , and the effective magnetic permeability for reasons of mathematical analogy,@xcite and is therefore related to a host of applications .",
    "diffusion - controlled reactions arise in widely different processes , such as heterogeneous catalysis,@xcite gas sensor operation,@xcite cell metabolism,@xcite crystal growth,@xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr).@xcite    these transport properties are related to several statistical geometrical and topological characteristics , which we therefore also study .",
    "these include the pore - size functions ( the distribution of the distance from a randomly chosen location in the void phase to the closest phase boundary),@xcite the quantizer error ( a moment of the pore - size function , which is related to the principal relaxation time),@xcite the order metric @xmath5 ( a measure of the translational order of point configurations),@xcite and the percolation threshold or the critical radius ( the radius of the spheres at which a specific phase becomes connected ) of each phase.@xcite    we compare the aforementioned physical and geometrical properties of our two - phase system derived from decorated stealthy ground states , as a function of the tuning parameter @xmath0 , with those of two other two - phase media : ( 1 ) equilibrium disordered ( fluid ) hard - sphere systems and ( 2 ) decorated poisson point processes ( ideal - gas configurations ) .",
    "the former has short - range order that is tunable by its volume fraction but no long - range order .",
    "the latter has neither short - range order nor long - range order . through comparison",
    ", we find that some of these quantities are dramatically affected by the degree of long - range order , while other quantities are much more sensitive to the degree of short - range order . because many of these quantities depend on the density , we re - scale all systems to unit number density to ensure a fair comparison .    among our major findings ,",
    "we show that these transport , geometrical and topological properties of our two - phase media are generally distinctly different from those of equilibrium hard - sphere systems and spatially uncorrelated overlapping spheres . at high @xmath0 values",
    ", the stealthy disordered two - phase media can attain nearly maximal effective diffusion coefficient , while also maintaining isotropy .",
    "this novel property could have practical implications , e.g. , optimal and isotropic drug release from designed nanoparticles .",
    "stealthy ground states tend to ideal gases configurationally in the @xmath6 limit .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , we find that even in the low-@xmath0 regime , our two - phase media have much lower principal relaxation time than that of equilibrium hard - sphere systems of similar degrees of order , indicating that the formation of large holes in the stealthy systems is strongly suppressed .",
    "lastly , we also find that the aforementioned geometrical and topological quantities are strongly correlated with each other .",

    "this paper studies properties of point - particle systems as well as two - phase heterogeneous media derived from certain decorations of these point configurations .",
    "a point - particle system consists of @xmath7 point particles with a certain probability density function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ... , @xmath11 is the particle positions , in a simulation box of volume @xmath12 under periodic boundary conditions in @xmath13-dimensional euclidean space @xmath14 , where @xmath13 is 2 or 3 .",
    "the number density is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "the `` poisson point process ''",
    "( also called `` ideal gas '' ) is produced by the probability density function @xmath16 that does not depend on particle positions @xmath17 .",
    "the equilibrium hard - sphere point process of radius @xmath2 is another point process with @xmath8 equal to a positive constant if the distance between every pair of points is larger than @xmath18 and zero otherwise .",
    "a realization of a two - phase medium can be mathematically described as a partition of a domain of space @xmath19 with volume @xmath20 into two separate regions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is characterized by an indicator function , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is any position in the two - phase medium .",
    "the indicator function @xmath23 is one if @xmath25 and zero if @xmath26 .",
    "the volume fraction of phase 1 is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "that of the other phase is given by @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the interface between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the specific surface , i.e. , the total area of @xmath30 divided by @xmath20 , is given by : @xmath31    the two - phase media that we consider here are derived from point configurations by decorating the point configurations with spheres ( circles ) ; specifically , each point is circumscribed by a sphere of radius @xmath2 that generally may overlap with one another .",
    "therefore , it is composed of a void region ( phase 1 ) and a particle region ( phase 2 ) .",
    "when such a mapping is applied to a poisson point process , the decorated system is also called `` fully penetrable spheres '' @xcite or `` spatially uncorrelated spheres . ''",

    "of particular interest in this paper is the `` stealthy '' interaction potential : @xmath36 where the sum is over all reciprocal lattice vector @xmath37 s of the simulation box such that @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40/2v_f \\label{temp1}\\ ] ] is a constant independent of the particle positions @xmath17 , and the second equal sign in eq .",

    "such potential is interesting not only because it is a pairwise additive potential [ as the right side of eq .",
    "( [ pot_f ] ) shows ] , but also because it allows one to directly tune the structure factor @xmath41 the ground state ( i.e. , @xmath42 or zero - temperature state ) of this potential is obtained by constraining @xmath43 for all @xmath38.@xcite    let @xmath44 be half the number of @xmath37 points in the summation of eq .  ; , @xmath44 is the number of independent constraints . ]",
    "the parameter @xmath45 determines the degree to which the ground states are constrained and therefore the degeneracy and disorder of the ground states.@xcite for @xmath4 , the ground states are typically disordered and uncountably infinitely degenerate.@xcite therefore , there are multiple ways to assign different weights ( i.e. , probabilities ) to different sets of ground states .",
    "one way of particular interest is the zero - temperature ( @xmath42 ) limit of eq .",
    "( [ canonical ] ) .",
    "ground states drawn from such distribution are called `` entropically favored ground states''.@xcite it is interesting to note that in the @xmath6 and @xmath46 limit , both entropically favored ground states of stealthy potentials and equilibrium hard - sphere point processes tend to poisson point process geometrically . in the rest of the paper",
    "this fact will be frequently used to test our simulation results since many properties of the poisson point process have been studied previously .",
    "this paper studies the following steady - state and time - dependent diffusion properties in phase 1 ( the void phase ) of decorated entropically favored ground states of stealthy potentials , and compare them with that of decorated poisson point process and equilibrium disordered ( fluid ) hard - sphere system at unit number density .",
    "consider the steady - state diffusion problem of some species with concentration field @xmath47 in a two - phase medium in which phase 1 is the space in which diffusion occurs and phase 2 are `` obstacles '' that the diffusing species can not enter . in phase 1 ,",
    "the flux of the species , @xmath48 , is predicted by fick s first law : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a diffusion coefficient which we set to unity for simplicity .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq_diffusion ] ) is valid only in phase 1 and has to be paired with the following neumann boundary condition : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the normal vector of the surface .",
    "we see that the inclusion of such obstacles adds a complicated boundary condition and makes the overall diffusion problem difficult . nevertheless , on a length scale",
    "much larger than the characteristic length of the obstacles , the system can be homogenized @xcite and characterized by an `` effective '' diffusion coefficient , @xmath53 , defined by the average fick s first law : @xmath54 where angular brackets denote ensemble averages .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient of an isotropic two - phase medium must satisfy the hashin - shtrikman ( hs ) upper bound.@xcite for our case where phase 1 has unit diffusion coefficient and phase 2 can not be entered , this bound in @xmath13 dimensions is given by : @xmath55 this bound is optimal because it is realizable by certain model microstructures , including the `` coated - sphere model '' described in ref .  , and is therefore the best possible bound for isotropic systems given volume - fraction information only .",
    "consider the problem of diffusion and reaction among absorbing `` traps '' in the random medium",
    ". let phase 1 be the region in which diffusion occurs and phase 2 be the trap region , the diffusion process in phase 1 is governed by the same fick s first law but with time dependency : @xmath56 this equation , combined with the conservation of the diffusing species inside phase 1 , @xmath57 , yields fick s second law : @xmath58 if phase 2 are absorbing `` traps '' ( rather than impenetrable obstacles as in the aforementioned effective diffusion problem ) , the boundary condition has to be changed . in the diffusion - controlled limit ,",
    "i.e. , when the reaction rate at the interface is infinite , we have the following boundary condition:@xcite @xmath59 if we also set the initial concentration to be uniform outside of traps : @xmath60 then we have the survival problem . the `` survival probability , '' @xmath61 is equal to the fraction of reactant not yet absorbed at time @xmath62:@xcite @xmath63 the mean survival time of the reactant is the zeroth moment of @xmath61 : @xcite . here",
    ", we use @xmath64 to avoid confusion with the order metric @xmath5 . ] @xmath65 the survival probability can be decomposed as a sum of exponential functions : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are coefficients and @xmath68 are relaxation times .",
    "the largest relaxation time is called `` principal relaxation time '' and by convention denoted @xmath69 .",
    "these quantities can be measured directly by nmr experiments since in nmr experiment of fluid - saturated porous media , proton magnetization decays mainly on the phase boundary.@xcite    it is worth noting that although the above problems involve differential equations , @xmath53 , @xmath61 , and @xmath64 can actually be calculated much more efficiently by simulating brownian motions using the so - called `` first - passage time '' technique .",
    "( see the sec .",
    "[ simulation ] for details . ) the effective diffusion coefficient can be found from the ratio of the mean square displacement of such brownian particles and the time spent .",
    "the survival probability @xmath61 is equal to the probability that a brownian particle have never reached any trap at time @xmath62 .",
    "the mean survival time , @xmath64 , can be calculated by integrating @xmath61 but can also be calculated , more easily , by finding the average time needed for a particle to reach a trap the first time .",
    "it is also worth noting that while the effective diffusion coefficient is identically zero as long as the void phase is not percolating , @xmath64 and @xmath69 are both positive until the spheres cover the entire space.@xcite      this paper also studies the following geometrical and topological properties that are intimately related to the aforementioned diffusion characteristics .",
    "as we have explained earlier , a hyperuniform many - particle system is one in which the structure factor , eq .",
    "( [ structurefactor ] ) , approaches zero in the @xmath70 limit .",
    "the name `` hyperuniform '' refers to an anomalous suppression of density fluctuations : consider random placements of a spherical observation window of radius @xmath71 in a @xmath13-dimensional many - particle system .",
    "the number of points contained in such window , @xmath72 , is a random variable .",
    "for a uniform but not hyperuniform many - particle system ( e.g. , ideal gas without a gravity field ) , @xmath73 for large @xmath71 scales as @xmath74 . for a hyperuniform system , @xmath73 for large",
    "@xmath71 grows more slowly than @xmath74 .",
    "it has been proved that the above - mentioned two conditions of hyperuniformity , @xmath75 and @xmath73 for large @xmath71 grows more slowly than @xmath74 , are mathematically equivalent.@xcite    a similar definition exists for two - phase media.@xcite one can compute the volume fraction of either phase inside a spherical observation window of radius @xmath71 and find its variance . for large @xmath71",
    ", this variance scales as @xmath76 for typical ( non - hyperuniform ) random two - phase media and decreases faster than @xmath76 for hyperuniform two - phase media .",
    "an equivalent condition for hyperuniformity is that @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is called the `` spectral density '' and @xmath79 is the fourier transform of @xmath80.@xcite    stealthy hyperuniform many - particle systems or two - phase media are subsets of hyperuniform many - particle systems or two - phase media in which @xmath81 or @xmath82 is zero for a range of @xmath37 vectors around the origin , i.e. , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is some positive number . for the many - particle systems mentioned in this paper , the ground state of `` stealthy '' potentials are stealthy and hyperuniform while equilibrium hard - sphere systems and poisson point process are neither stealthy nor hyperuniform .",
    "when we decorate a point - particle configuration by replacing points with spheres of radius @xmath2 , the whole collection of spheres is considered a `` sphere packing '' if each pair of point particles is separated by a distance of at least @xmath18 ( i.e. , if the spheres do not overlap ) .",
    "the fraction of space occupied by the union of spheres , @xmath85 , is called the packing fraction @xmath86 . of particular interest in this paper",
    "is the maximum packing radius @xmath87 , which is half the minimum separation distance between two particles , and maximum packing fraction @xmath88 , which is the volume fraction of phase 2 when @xmath89 .",
    "why should we study the maximum packing fraction ?",
    "one important reason is that when we decorate a point configuration and map it into a two - phase medium , if spheres do not overlap , then the spectral density @xmath90 of the two - phase medium is proportional to the structure factor @xmath81 of the underlying point configuration:@xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the volume of a @xmath13-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath2 and @xmath93 is the bessel function of order @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , a decorated stealthy point configuration is a stealthy two - phase medium if @xmath95 . when @xmath96 , however , eq .  ( [ chi_s ] ) no longer holds and we will see in sec .",
    "[ packing_stealthy ] that decorated systems are generally no longer stealthy or hyperuniform .      given a point - particle system ,",
    "the void - exclusion probability @xmath97 is the probability that a spherical cavity of radius @xmath98 , centered at a random location , is empty of particles .",
    "a related quantity is @xmath99/(\\partial r)$ ] , the probability density function of the distance to the nearest particle from a randomly chosen location .",
    "a different interpretation of @xmath100 is that if each point particle is replaced with a sphere of radius @xmath2 , then @xmath101 is the volume fraction of the space outside of the spheres , i.e. , @xmath102 since @xmath103 is the negative derivative of @xmath100 , @xmath104 is the specific surface @xmath105.@xcite    another quantity related to @xmath97 is the scaled dimensionless quantizer error @xmath106 . for a point configuration with positions @xmath107 ,",
    "a quantizer is a device that takes as an input a position @xmath24 in @xmath108 and outputs the nearest point @xmath109 of the configuration to @xmath24 .",
    "assuming @xmath24 is uniformly distributed , one can define a mean square error , which can be obtained from @xmath97 via the relation:@xcite @xmath110    finally , two more related quantities can be defined for two - phase media .",
    "the pore - size cumulative distribution function , @xmath111 , is defined as the fraction of pore space ( i.e. , space covered by phase 1 ) which has a pore radius larger than @xmath112 .",
    "the function @xmath111 of our decorated system is trivially related to @xmath97 of the underlying point - particle system : @xmath113 moreover , the associated pore - size probability density function is given by @xmath114/(\\partial \\delta)$ ] .",
    "this pore - size function at the origin is related to the specific surface , @xmath105 , by @xmath115    it is interesting to note that the moments of @xmath111 are related to the mean survival time and principle relaxation time via the following rigorous lower bounds @xcite : @xmath116 and @xmath117 we see that @xmath106 is proportional to the first moment of @xmath111 in the @xmath46 limit and is therefore related to the principal relaxation time .",
    "we will be studying the above properties for systems of varying degrees of order .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a way to quantify such order .",
    "moreover , since the underlying point - configurations we study include both stealthy ground states , which have long - range order , and equilibrium liquid hard - sphere systems , which have short - range order , we desire an order metric that reflects short - range order and long - range order equally well .",
    "a suitable choice is the order metric @xmath5 , introduced in ref .   and",
    "defined as : @xmath118 ^ 2 d\\mathbf r = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^dd^d } \\int_0^\\infty [ s(k)-1]^2 d\\mathbf k , \\label{tau}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is some characteristic length scale , @xmath119 is the pair correlation function,@xcite @xmath120 is the angular average of @xmath81 , and the second equal sign can be proved by parseval s theorem . in this paper , we simply let @xmath121 because we always rescale the configuration to make the number density unity .",
    "since the effective diffusion coefficient is trivially zero when the void phase is topologically disconnected , it is important to quantify when the phases are connected . to do this",
    ", we will be considering the percolation properties of the systems .",
    "as we specified earlier , we map point configurations into two - phase media by replacing each point with a sphere of radius @xmath2 . for phase 2 , the critical or percolation radius , @xmath122 , is the minimum @xmath2 such that a connected part of phase 2 becomes infinite in size .",
    "the percolation volume fraction , @xmath123 , is the fraction of space occupied by the union of spheres of radius @xmath122 .",
    "we can define similar percolation characteristics of the void phase.@xcite the percolation radius of the void phase , @xmath124 , is defined as the maximum @xmath2 such that there is still an infinite - sized connected part of phase 1 .",
    "the percolation volume fraction , @xmath125 , is the volume fraction of phase 1 at radius @xmath124 . in two dimensions ,",
    "it is very rare to have both phases percolating simultaneously ( see ref .",
    "for such a rare example ) . in our case , @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in three dimensions",
    ", however , both phases can simultaneously percolate , i.e. , the two - phase system is bicontinuous .",
    "indeed , this is the case for our 3d systems and hence we must compute @xmath124 and @xmath122 separately .",
    "we generate entropically favored ground states of stealthy potentials using the same protocol as our previous work.@xcite this protocol involves performing molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations at a very low temperature ( @xmath128 in 2d and @xmath129 in 3d in dimensionless units ) , taking snapshots periodically , and performing a local energy minimization starting from each snapshot . because the md temperature is sufficiently low ,",
    "the snapshots before energy minimization are already very close to ground states .",
    "therefore , the ground states produced by the subsequent energy minimization closely follow the canonical distribution in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "we generate 20,000 configurations per @xmath0 value , same as ref .  .",
    "the only two differences between this work and our previous work @xcite are ( 1 ) system sizes are different ( see appendix  [ number ] for our choice of system sizes and the justification ) , and ( 2 ) each configuration is rescaled to unit number density ( in order to ensure a fair comparison ) .      we also generate equilibrium disordered hard - sphere systems via standard monte - carlo techniques in order to compare their statistics with entropically favored stealthy ground states statistics .",
    "depending on the packing fraction @xmath130 , an equilibrium hard - sphere system can be disordered ( liquid - like ) or crystalline .",
    "disordered equilibrium hard - sphere system exists for @xmath131 in 2d and @xmath132 in 3d.@xcite therefore , the packing fraction we used include @xmath133 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 , 0.35 , 0.4 , 0.45 , 0.5 , 0.55 , 0.6 , 0.65 , and 0.68 in 2d and @xmath133 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 , 0.35 , 0.4 , 0.45 , and 0.48 in 3d . for each @xmath130 in each dimension , we generate equilibrium hard - sphere systems with @xmath134 , 300 , and 500 particles . in each case , the system was first equilibrated with @xmath135 trial moves .",
    "after that , we sample a configuration every @xmath136 trial moves until we obtain 20,000 configurations .",
    "similar to the stealthy ground states , we keep the number density @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , we adjust sphere radius to attain a desired packing fraction .      because the method we used to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient is an extension of the method to calculate survival probability and mean survival time , we will explain the latter method first .",

    "[ correlations ] , we explore the correlation between @xmath106 , @xmath5 , and @xmath227 , and compare that for entropically favored stealthy ground states with that for equilibrium disordered hard - sphere systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that these two systems behave very differently . at the same @xmath5 ,",
    "stealthy systems give lower values of @xmath228 , indicating @xmath228 is more sensitive to long - range order than to short - range order .",
    "at the same @xmath5 or @xmath228 , stealthy systems give higher values of @xmath123 , indicating that @xmath123 is even more sensitive to long - range order than to short - range order .",
    "in this work , we decorated stealthy disordered hyperuniform point configurations of different degrees of order with spheres of various radii , and computed several transport and structural properties of these decorated systems .",
    "the transport properties that we studied include effective diffusion coefficient @xmath152 , mean survival time @xmath64 , survival probability @xmath61 , and principal relaxation time @xmath69 . the structural properties examined include hyperuniformity and stealthiness , maximum packing fraction @xmath206 , the void - exclusion probability @xmath100 , the order metric @xmath5 , and the percolation thresholds @xmath125 and @xmath123 .",
    "we showed that the order metric @xmath5 is an exquisite detector of both short- and long - range translational order . while all geometrical and topological quantities are strongly correlated ( positive correlation between @xmath123 and @xmath5 , and negative correlation between @xmath106 and the former two quantities ) , the relation between the physical quantities are more complex : while @xmath152 increases as @xmath0 increases or as @xmath85 decreases , @xmath64 and @xmath69 increases as @xmath0 decreases or as @xmath85 decreases .",
    "therefore , there is no simple relationship between @xmath152 and @xmath64 or @xmath69 .",
    "another reason why there is no such relationship is because if phase 1 ceases to percolate , then @xmath152 becomes zero but @xmath64 and @xmath69 are still positive @xcite .    besides finding correlations between geometrical and topological properties , we find that in the highly disordered ( @xmath229 ) regime , @xmath69 of our two - phase systems derived from decorated stealthy ground states is much lower than that of equilibrium hard - sphere system .",
    "together with the void - exclusion probability , low @xmath69 suggests that the formation of large holes is strongly suppressed , even though the configuration appears completely disordered .    in the higher order ( @xmath230 ) regime",
    ", @xmath152 of our disordered isotropic two - phase systems derived from decorated stealthy ground states is very close to the hashin - shtrikman upper bound for @xmath231 , where @xmath206 is the maximum packing fraction . since such decorated systems maintain stealthiness if and only if @xmath232 , our results suggest a connection between stealthiness and the ability to have a nearly optimal ( maximal ) @xmath152 .",
    "the fact that stealthy disordered two - phase media have nearly optimal @xmath152 could have practical implications , e.g. , optimal and isotropic drug release from designed nanoparticles . although nearly optimal @xmath152 can also be achieved by lattice structures ( i.e. , periodic arrays of inclusions ) , the latter are always anisotropic .",
    "thus , if one desires isotropic two - phase media with highest possible @xmath152 at a specific volume fraction , disordered stealthy two - phase media could be the best choice .",
    "disordered stealthy ground states are uncountably infinitely degenerate.@xcite the maximum packing fraction @xmath206 varies among configurations . in the future , it would be interesting to design algorithms that sample stealthy ground states with a bias toward configurations with higher @xmath206 values .",
    "with such an algorithm , one would be able to design isotropic two - phase media with nearly optimal @xmath152 with very high @xmath85 .",
    "lastly , we would like to mention that although here we only study the diffusion problem of point brownian particles , the diffusion problem of finite - sized brownian particles has also been of interest.@xcite it is noteworthy that our results can be trivially extended to the latter case .",
    "the diffusion of brownian particles of radius @xmath233 among obstacles of radius @xmath2 is equivalent to the diffusion of point brownian particles among obstacles of radius @xmath234 .",
    "this mapping was previously exploited to quantify diffusion of finite - sized spheres in various models of porous media.@xcite    interestingly , one can relate the transport properties computed here ( @xmath152 , @xmath64 , and @xmath69 ) to different physical properties of the same systems via cross - property relations , including those that relate them to the elastic moduli , @xcite as well as fluid permeability .",
    "@xcite in future work , we will carry out such analyses .",
    "the authors thank duyu chen and jaeuk kim for their careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "as discussed in sec .  [ generatingstealthy ] , it is nontrivial to choose the system size @xmath7 and parameter @xmath0 , especially because one of our protocol to calculate the percolation threshold requires three different @xmath7 s for each @xmath0 .",
    "we enumerated all possible choices of @xmath7 s and @xmath0 s for @xmath235 and picked up some @xmath0 values that allow at least three different choices of @xmath7 s .",
    "our choice of @xmath7 and @xmath0 in 2d and 3d are listed in tables  [ n_2d ] and [ n_3d ] .",
    "it is desirable to consider values of @xmath0 higher than 0.4133 ... in 3d , but our enumeration did not find such a @xmath0 value that satisfies the above condition .",
    "therefore , we chose three more @xmath7 s that allow @xmath0 to be very close to @xmath236 but makes @xmath0 differ in the fifth decimal place .",
    "see the caption for table  [ n_3d ] for details .",
    "except for the percolation threshold calculation , we only use the largest @xmath7 for each @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",

    "<S> we map these stealthy disordered hyperuniform point configurations to two - phase media by circumscribing each point with a possibly overlapping sphere of a common radius @xmath2 : the `` particle '' and `` void '' phases are taken to be the space interior and exterior to the spheres , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperuniformity of such two - phase media depend on the sphere sizes : while it was previously analytically proven that the resulting two - phase media maintain hyperuniformity if spheres do not overlap , here we show numerically that they lose hyperuniformity whenever the spheres overlap . </S>",
    "<S> we study certain transport properties of these systems , including the effective diffusion coefficient of point particles diffusing in the void phase as well as static and time - dependent characteristics associated with diffusion - controlled reactions . besides these effective transport properties </S>",
    "<S> , we also investigate several related structural properties , including pore - size functions , quantizer error , an order metric , and percolation thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these transport , geometrical and topological properties of our two - phase media derived from decorated stealthy ground states are distinctly different from those of equilibrium hard - sphere systems and spatially uncorrelated overlapping spheres . </S>",
    "<S> as the extent of short - range order increases , stealthy disordered two - phase media can attain nearly maximal effective diffusion coefficients over a broad range of volume fractions while also maintaining isotropy , and therefore may have practical applications in situations where ease of transport is desirable . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the percolation threshold and the order metric are positively correlated with each other , while both of them are negatively correlated with the quantizer error . in the highly disordered regime ( @xmath3 ) , stealthy point - particle configurations are weakly - perturbed ideal gases . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , reactants of diffusion - controlled reactions decay much faster in our two - phase media than in equilibrium hard - sphere systems of similar degrees of order , and hence indicate that the formation of large holes is strongly suppressed in the former systems . </S>"
