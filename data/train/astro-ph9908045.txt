    "the observations were performed with the eso 3.6 m telescope equiped with mefos during 6 nights on november 5 - 11 , 1994 and 2 nights on november 24 - 26 , 1995 .",
    "a description of the instrument can be found in durret et al .",
    "the grating used with the boller & chivens spectrograph had 300 grooves / mm , giving a dispersion of 224   / mm in the wavelength region 3820 - 6100   .",
    "the detector was ccd # 32 , with 512@xmath3 pixels of @xmath4 m .",
    "the catalogue of galaxy positions used in this survey was obtained with the mama measuring machine and is presented in a companion paper ( slezak et al .",
    "this catalogue gives very accurate positions , but magnitudes in the photographic  band are known with an accuracy of 0.1 magnitude at best .",
    "ccd photometry of the central regions of the cluster in the v and r bands was later performed to recalibrate these  magnitudes and to obtain r magnitudes for the entire photometric sample .",
    "we observed spectroscopically a total of 15 fields , with exposure times of 2@xmath030 minutes , and we obtained 473 spectra in total ( plus the same number of sky spectra ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude for the galaxies observed spectroscopically was = 19 , corresponding to a recalibrated magnitude r@xmath518.7 ( see section  3 ) .",
    "[ xy ]    out of the 473 spectra obtained , we measured 410 reliable redshifts ( the other ones were discarded due to insufficient signal to noise ratio ) . since 4 is at a relatively low galactic latitude , the effects of stellar contamination of our photographic plate catalogue are large .",
    "our star - galaxy separation software was imperfect since out of the 410 objects for which redshufts were measured only 305 were galaxies .",
    "such a high degree of contamination of the catalogue is at least partly due to the fact that we preferred to have a galaxy catalogue as complete as possible , in order not to `` miss '' galaxies .",
    "our catalogue includes these 305 galaxy spectra , plus those previously published by proust et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , quintana & ramrez ( 1990 ) and malumuth et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and some galaxies from the cfa redshift catalogue ( huchra et al .",
    "1992 ) , reaching a total of 466 galaxy redshifts after eliminating objects observed twice .",
    "the positions of the objects for which we gathered reliable spectra ( either from our observations or from the literature ) are shown in fig .",
    "these positions are relative to the cluster center taken to be the position of the maximum x - ray emission ( pislar 1998 ) : @xmath6 .",
    "this center is within 7 arcsec of the position of the cd galaxy , a distance which is smaller than the rosat pspc pixel size , and we will therefore consider hereafter that both positions coincide .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the iraf software .",
    "the frames were bias corrected in the usual way .",
    "velocities were measured by cross - correlating the observed spectra with different templates : a spectrum of m31 ( kindly provided by j. perea ) at a velocity of @xmath7  km  s@xmath2 , and stellar spectra of the standard stars hd  24331 and hd  48381 , which were each observed every night during our 1994 run .",
    "the cross - correlation technique is that described by tonry & davis ( 1979 ) and implemented in the xcsao task of the rvsao package in iraf ( kurtz et al .",
    "the errors on the velocities derived from absorption lines are given automatically by this task .",
    "the positions of emission lines , when present , were measured by fitting each line with a gaussian .",
    "all the redshifts were measured by the same person ( f.d . ) in a homogeneous way .",
    "redshifts of insufficient quality were discarded ( i.e. those with a tonry & davis parameter smaller than 2.0 , except for three galaxies with respective tonry & davis parameters of 1.5 , 1.6 and 1.9 where the absorption lines seemed to be well enough defined for these redshifts to be kept in the final catalogue ) .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ compl ]    we have estimated the completeness of the final spectroscopic catalogue presented here by comparing the number of galaxies with redshifts to the total number of galaxies from our photographic plate catalogue in the same area .",
    "results are shown in table  [ compl ] .",
    "note that the 17 galaxies in our redshift catalogue which do not have magnitudes ( see section 3 ) have been excluded from these statistics , and therefore the catalogue completeness may be slightly larger than estimated in the table .",
    "the magnitude histograms for the galaxies and stars misclassified as non - psf - like objects are displayed in figs .  [ maggal ] and [ magstars ] respectively .",
    "the percentage of contamination by stars is very high : about 20% .    for a large fraction of the galaxies taken from the literature ,",
    "r magnitudes were made available to us by c. adami ( private communication ) . in order to give magnitudes for all galaxies in the same photometric band , we estimated the r band magnitudes for the galaxies that we observed .",
    "this was done by identifying galaxies both in our photographic plate catalogue and in our ccd catalogue , and by finding the best linear fit ( see slezak et al .",
    "1999 for details ) .",
    "this best fit was : @xmath8 , with the slope fixed to 1.0 , giving an _ rms _ fluctuation of 0.04 .",
    "the galaxies in the literature for which adami did not have magnitudes were identified with objects in our photographic plate catalogue , and we applied the same relation to derive their r magnitudes from their b@xmath9 magnitudes .",
    "for some of the cfa galaxies , only b@xmath10 magnitudes were available ; we roughly transformed them to r magnitudes , by calculating the mean ( v@xmath11r ) colour for the 239 galaxies detected in v in our ccd catalogue ( slezak et al .",
    "1999 ) ; this mean value is equal to 0.48 , and therefore roughly corresponds to a g0 star for which ( v@xmath11r)=0.52 and ( b@xmath11v)=0.58 ( e.g. allen 1981 ) , leading to r@xmath5b@xmath111.1 ; for these cfa galaxies , we therefore took r= b@xmath12 .",
    "33 galaxies in our redshift catalogue have no identification with our photometric catalogue : 4 from quintana & ramrez ( 1990 ) , 14 from malumuth et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , 1 from proust et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and 14 from huchra et al .",
    "they are the objects in table 4 that have labels 2 to 5 in column ( 16 ) , and their corresponding identification number in the literature , but no identification number from our photographic plate catalogue .",
    "note that out of these 33 objects , half are located outside the area covered by our photometric catalogue , and three are located less than 1 arcmin from the cluster center , so we can not separate them from the cd .",
    "the reason for the lack of identification of the other objects is not clear , since in all the cases where we did identify galaxies from our sample to galaxies in the literature the coordinates matched within a few arcseconds .",
    "the most likely explanation is that the coordinates given in the literature for these objects are not accurate ; the fact that they may have not been detected in our photographic plate scan is unlikely since they are all very bright ( r@xmath1316.8 ) .",
    "[ maggal ]    [ magstars ]    the coordinates and magnitudes of the 101 stars misclassified as galaxies are given in table 3 ( available in electronic form only ) , to avoid further observations of these objects in galaxy surveys .",
    "the velocity data for the galaxies in the field of abcg  496 are given in table  4 ( available in electronic form only ) .",
