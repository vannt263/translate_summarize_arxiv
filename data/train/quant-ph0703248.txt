    "according to a classic calculation @xcite , the casimir force inside a roughly cubical rectangular parallelepiped is repulsive ; that is , it tends to expand the box .",
    "the reasoning leading to this conclusion is open to criticism on two related grounds : it ignores the possibility of nontrivial vacuum energy in the region outside the box , and it involves `` renormalization '' in the sense of discarding divergent terms associated with the boundary although ( unlike the case of parallel plates , or any calculation of forces between rigid bodies ) the geometry of the boundary depends upon the dimensions of the box . recently",
    "( see also @xcite ) a class of scenarios called `` casimir pistons '' has been introduced to which these objections do not apply .",
    "the piston is an idealized plate that is free to move along a rectangular shaft , whose length , @xmath0 , to the right of the piston is taken arbitrarily large ( fig .  [",
    "fig : piston ] ) .",
    "both the external region and the divergent ( or cutoff - dependent ) terms in the internal vacuum energy are independent of the piston position , @xmath1 , so that a well - defined , finite force on the piston is calculated .",
    "one finds that this force is always attractive , both for a two - dimensional scalar - field model with the dirichlet boundary condition  @xcite and for a three - dimensional electromagnetic field with the perfect - conductor boundary condition  @xcite .",

    "this result is somewhat ironic in that one reason for suspicion of repulsive casimir forces is the belief that the force between disjoint bodies of realistically modeled material should be always attractive .",
    "the unexpected result is easily understood , however , as being due to attraction between the piston and the distant part of the shaft .",
    "the effect would disappear if the shaft extended a long distance to the left of the fixed plate ( `` baffle '' ) at @xmath3 as well as to the right of the piston .",
    "in the present paper we study the vacuum energy and casimir forces in one - dimensional quantum graph models and observe several situations with idealized boundary conditions for which the piston force is unambiguously repulsive . in quantum graphs of high symmetry",
    ", the casimir forces may be calculated analytically .",
    "more generally , we show that these forces may be obtained systematically from a sum over the classical periodic orbits in the graph , as done in three - dimensional problems in @xcite , and we discuss the rate of convergence of the periodic - orbit expansion . in some cases , the sign and approximate magnitude of the force on a casimir piston may be obtained using only the shortest orbit hitting that piston .",
    "although the quantum graph models are less realistic than those studied in @xcite and  @xcite , they do show that repulsive casimir forces do arise physically and are not inevitably an artifact of a naive renormalization scheme .",

    "these models have also served as valuable testing grounds for studying more general properties of quantum behavior , including anderson localization , quantum chaos , adiabatic quantum transport , and scattering .",

    "the first example is already rather well known , in its essence . consider a scalar field quantized on a line divided into three parts by two points , at each of which either a dirichlet or a neumann boundary condition is imposed .",
    "the contributions of the two infinite ( or , better , extremely long ) intervals to the casimir force will vanish .",

    "( more generally , a periodic - orbit calculation , such as discussed in section  [ secorbit ] , is applicable to unequal piston displacements and confirms that the force on each individual piston is outward , so there are no other , asymmetrical modes that are partly attractive . )",
    "this repulsive effect can not be attributed to mixed boundary conditions , since all the conditions are of the neumann type .",

    "computing the spectrum numerically , as discussed below , allows for an accurate evaluation of the vacuum energy for any specific quantum graph , but this type of brute force calculation must be repeated anew for every geometry and does not provide much physical insight regarding the attractive or repulsive character of casimir forces in different cases . instead",

    "when @xmath57 depends on  @xmath59 , two complications arise .",
    "first , the method of images can not be so easily applied to `` time - domain '' integral kernels such as @xmath75 and the heat kernel , because the reflection law becomes nonlocal in  @xmath76 .",

    "to evaluate the accuracy of the periodic - orbit expansion in situations where no analytic expression for the vacuum energy is available , we may compare with a brute - force calculation where the spectrum is evaluated numerically .",
    "for a general @xmath8-vertex graph , the normal - mode frequencies are given by solutions of a characteristic equation @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a @xmath80 matrix  @xcite .",

    "is given by the shortest primitive orbits , each of which travels back and forth along a single bond .",

    "in principle , a repulsive piston can be constructed in the more realistic case of the electromagnetic field in dimension  3 , in analogy with our original one - dimensional model .",
    "if the electromagnetic analog of the dirichlet condition is a perfect conductor , then the analog of the neumann condition is a material with infinite magnetic permeability , and the casimir force between slabs of these two different types is repulsive  @xcite .",
    "( a list of references on this topic appears in @xcite . )",
    "the existence of real materials with sufficient permeability to exhibit casimir repulsion in the laboratory is controversial @xcite .",
    "here we merely check that the piston effect discovered by cavalcanti @xcite and the mit group @xcite does not destroy the repulsion shown by less sophisticated calculations .",
    "this is not trivial , since the effect arises from the action of the shaft walls on the transverse behavior of the field .",
    "following lukosz  @xcite , but in a notation closer to cavalcanti s ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : piston ] ) , we consider a rectangular box with dimensions @xmath1 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 . as previously exemplified , we can calculate a finite vacuum energy naively , in full confidence that the discarded divergent terms will cancel when a force is calculated for the piston system as a whole .",
    "we are interested in the case where the piston ( the surface that is free to move ) is infinitely permeable but the shaft and the baffle ( the rest of the box ) are perfect conductors . by the rayleigh ",

    "( throughout this discussion `` pressure '' simply means `` force per area '' without necessarily implying a local pressure independent of position on the wall . )",
    "thus ( [ dnforce ] ) follows from ( [ ddforce ] ) by virtue of @xmath121 =    -\\frac{\\pi } { 24a }   \\left[-\\,\\frac12\\right],\\ ] ] and the three - dimensional analogs will involve quantities proportional to @xmath122 =    \\frac1{a^3 } \\left[-\\,\\frac78\\right ] \\,.\\ ] ]    when @xmath123 , lukosz calculates an attractive pressure @xmath124 which implies by ( [ rayleigh ] ) boyer s formula @xcite @xmath125 for the box with one permeable wall .",

    ", lukosz finds a repulsive pressure ( involving catalan s constant ) @xmath127 just as in @xcite , the resulting force is inversely proportional to the cross - sectional area and is independent of  @xmath0 , so the corresponding energy term is proportional to  @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , application of ( [ rayleigh ] ) gives @xmath128 ( as ought to be the case , since the nature of the plate at the distant end of the long shaft ought to be irrelevant ) .",
    "to find the total force on the piston , we must reverse the sign of ( [ outside ] ) , add it to ( [ inside ] ) , and multiply by the area , @xmath129 .",
    "the point is that the total force is positive if @xmath130 ; the long external part of the shaft has negligible effect in that case .",
    "on the other hand , for a cube lukosz found that the perfectly conducting box was already repulsive .",
    "the formula ( [ rayleigh ] ) does not yield a simple factor @xmath131 in that case , because the doubled box is no longer a cube .",
    "nevertheless , the graph presented in @xcite shows that @xmath132 is closer to @xmath133 than to @xmath134 .",
