    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite will observe many different gravitational - wave signals , including stochastic gravitational radiation from a variety of sources .",
    "the gravitational - wave foreground produced by galactic white dwarf binaries is a guaranteed ( anisotropic ) signal @xcite , but one also expects lisa to see other types of stochastic gravitational radiation , possibly including ( isotropic ) backgrounds from the very early universe  @xcite and foregrounds from populations of extra - galactic sources  @xcite . for anisotropic foregrounds ,",
    "the stochastic signal will be modulated , with a period of one year , by lisa s orbital motion around the sun .",
    "hence search techniques that take advantage of this modulation can be used to distinguish the astrophysical signal from instrumental noise @xcite . for isotropic backgrounds ,",
    "an alternative search method is needed , which will work in the absence of any ( statistical ) time - variation of the signal relative to the noise .",
    "one approach that has been proposed to search for isotropic gravitational radiation is to use a particular combination of the lisa output , called the _ symmetrised sagnac _",
    "channel @xcite , as a real - time noise monitor for lisa .",
    "this is possible at low - frequencies ( i.e. , less than a few mhz ) , since the response of the symmetrised sagnac channel to gravitational waves is highly suppressed for these frequencies .",
    "one can then compare the power in the symmetrised sagnac channel to that in another observable that _ is _ sensitive to gravitational waves , and then ` subtract ' the two to estimate the power in the gravitational - wave background @xcite . for this subtraction method to work , one needs to know how the instrumental noise power in the two channels are related to one another .",
    "otherwise , one might falsely assign too much ( little ) power to the gravitational - wave component if one underestimates ( overestimates ) the instrumental noise power in the gravitational - wave channel .",
    "obviously , one can not unambiguously observe isotropic stochastic radiation without any prior knowledge about the instrumental noise .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the analyses of @xcite by recasting the symmetrised sagnac method in the framework of bayesian inference ; we then use it to search for stochastic gravitational - wave signals in data taken from round 2 of the mock lisa data challenge ( mldc ) @xcite .",
    "( these are mock data sets released by the mldc taskforce , which contain simulated data from simplified models of lisa and restricted numbers of astrophysical sources . )",
    "the purpose of our study is to assess the performance of the symmetrised sagnac method for different levels of prior information regarding the instrumental noise . using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods to calculate the posterior probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the relevant parameters ,",
    "we explicitly show how the uncertainty in our estimate of the gravitational - wave signal power depends on our prior knowledge of the relationship between the instrumental noise power in the symmetrised sagnac and gravitational - wave channels .",
    "in particular , we find that a prior uncertainty of a factor @xmath0 in the ratio between the power of the instrumental noise contributions in the two channels allows for the detection of isotropic stochastic radiation .",
    "for the specific case considered here ( and driven by the mldc data sets released in challenge 2 ) , in which the amplitude of the gravitational - wave signal dominates the instrumental noise , a more accurate knowledge of this ratio , say within a factor of @xmath1 , provides only a marginal improvement for signal detection .",
    "this particular result depends of course on the signal - to - noise ratio , and we do not try , in this paper , to answer conclusively this question of detectability as a function of signal - to - noise ratio and prior information .",
    "nonetheless , we provide a conceptually transparent framework that allows us to quantitatively investigate this problem ; the formalism enables more realistic studies of lisa s performance and associated requirements in the context of searches for stochastic signals that could yield some of the most exiting discoveries of the mission .",
    "some of these issues are currently under investigation and will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s : method ] , we present details of the analysis method , and its application to lisa . in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] , we give the results of our analysis when applied to the mldc data sets . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s : conclusion ] we summarise our findings and discuss possible extensions for future investigations .",
    "lisa will consist of three spacecraft in a ( nearly ) equilateral configuration of side @xmath5  km , trailing the earth by about 20 degrees .",
    "the distances between the spacecraft will be modulated by incident gravitational waves at the level of picometres .",
    "the modulation will be sensed by monitoring the frequency ( or , equivalently , phase ) of laser beams exchanged between the spacecraft , and comparing this to locally - generated reference laser signals .",
    "the six raw doppler measurements can be combined in various ways using the principle of time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) @xcite .",
    "we use the first - generation tdi combinations , in which it is assumed that lisa is rigid and symmetric , and that laser frequency noise cancels completely .",
    "this is consistent with the conventions adopted in the context of the mldcs @xcite , but the analysis presented here can be generalised to second - generation tdi . in particular , we work with the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 combinations , which are independent and noise - orthogonal @xcite . for frequencies smaller than the inverse of the light travel - time down a lisa arm ( @xmath6 ) , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 combinations are equivalent to two unequal - arm michelson interferometers , with independent noise , rotated at 45 degrees to each other , and thus are sensitive to the two orthogonal polarisations of gravitational waves . for these low frequencies ,",
    "the response of the @xmath4 channel to gravitational - waves is highly - suppressed ( similar to the response of the standard symmetrised sagnac combination @xmath7 ) , and hence can be used as a real - time noise monitor , as discussed above . for simplicity , in what follows , we will restrict attention to the @xmath2 and @xmath4 channels .",
    "the analysis can easily be extended to also include @xmath3 , which will improve our ability to detect gravitational waves by reducing the uncertainty in our estimates by a factor of @xmath8 @xcite .      for low frequencies ,",
    "the output of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 channels in the frequency domain have the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 denote the instrumental noise in the two channels , and @xmath11 denotes the stochastic gravitational - wave signal .",
    "( here @xmath12 denotes the discrete fourier transform of the time domain data , so that @xmath13 , @xmath14 , etc .",
    "are dimensionless quantities . )",
    "notice that we assume that in the frequency window of interest the gravitational - wave contribution is perfectly suppressed in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "we also assume that the instrumental noises and stochastic signal are zero - mean gaussian random variables , with variances @xmath15 and that the noises in the two channels are related by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is some multiplicative factor , which we may not know in advance .",
    "( the variances @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and multiplicative factor @xmath17 all vary as functions of frequency ; however , in the analysis below we consider one frequency bin at a time , and therefore do not explicitly show the dependence of these variables on frequency . ) since the noise in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 channels are uncorrelated with one another and with the gravitational - wave signal , the covariance matrix is @xmath21 note that the problem consists , in general , of _ three _ unknown variables , @xmath22 .",
    "measurements of the two channels @xmath23 give us only _ two _ independent constraints .",
    "application of bayes theorem allows us to construct the joint posterior probability density function ( pdf ) of the unknown parameters @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the joint prior pdf of the parameters , @xmath26 is the likelihood function , and @xmath27 , the so - called evidence or marginal likelihood , can be regarded simply as a normalisation constant throughout .",
    "the likelihood function for a single frequency bin is a multivariate gaussian @xmath28_{ij } d_j \\right]}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the noise covariance matrix given by ( [ e : cov ] ) .",
    "we can construct a likelihood function for multiple time segments by simply multiplying the likelihoods of the individual segments .",
    "the posterior pdf for any given parameter ( or subset of parameters ) , say @xmath30 , can be obtained by _ marginalising _ the joint posterior over the remaining parameters : @xmath31 markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods can be used to explore the posterior pdfs , and to find the marginal posterior pdf on each parameter . from the marginal posteriors",
    "one can then compute the posterior mean on each parameter : @xmath32 and the @xmath33 probability intervals @xmath34 $ ] , where the limits define the _ smallest _ interval containing @xmath33 of the total probability : @xmath35 the prior pdfs contain the information we have about the parameters before making the observations . for our analysis",
    "we assume _ no prior knowledge _ of the variances @xmath20 and @xmath19 , and choose flat priors @xmath36 and similarly for @xmath19 .",
    "we also used flat priors for @xmath17 , but in order to investigate how our prior knowledge of the multiplicative factor @xmath17 affected the posterior pdfs , the upper and lower limits of the priors were varied , to represent different states of prior knowledge of the relative instrumental noise levels in the two channels .",
    "the analysis method detailed above has been applied to the second round of the mldc  @xcite .",
    "the data sets supplied by the mldc taskforce are the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 `` unequal - arm michelson '' combinations of the six optical readouts .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 combinations which we use can be constructed in the frequency domain as linear combinations of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    the second round of the mldc consists of various data sets containing different classes of signals @xcite . the 2.1 data set , which we were primarily interested in , contains the signal from @xmath40 million white dwarf binaries generated according to a galactic population model superimposed on gaussian - stationary instrumental noise .",
    "although the astrophysical population produces an anisotropic stochastic signal below a few mhz , with some sources generating sufficiently strong radiation to allow their identification , we apply our method to the training 2.1 data set as a proof - of - principle demonstration of the symmetrised sagnac approach .",
    "since the background is anisotropic , the level of the galactic signal will vary throughout the year as lisa orbits the sun , so our method provides an estimate of the _ average _ power of the gravitational - wave signal over the total observation time .",
    "one important point that we addressed was how to validate the results of our analysis .",
    "the first round data set 1.1.1a  @xcite contains just instrumental noise ( with the same statistical properties and spectrum as the one used for the 2.1 data sets ) , with one injected binary signal at 1.06 mhz , which is outside of the frequency range of our analysis .",
    "this data set could therefore be used to estimate the noise power spectral density ( psd ) of the @xmath2 channel in the absence of a signal , and hence determine the true value of @xmath17 , which was needed to validate our results .",

    "line ( c ) shows the psd of the @xmath2 channel in the mldc 1.1.1a data set , which contains just one injected binary , at @xmath41 mhz , which is outside of the frequency band of interest . as there are no signals in the 1.1.1a data set below @xmath42 mhz , this psd is representative of the detector noise in the @xmath2 channel , and was used to determine the true value of @xmath17 , which was needed to validate the results of our analysis.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] [ f : mldc_noise ]    the analysis described in sec .",

    "we assumed that the signal was stationary , although in reality it varies periodically over the year .",

    ", we considered a single frequency bin centred at 0.602 mhz , and chose three different priors for @xmath17 , see equation  ( [ e : def - a ] ) : ( i ) an _ unconstrained _ prior , where @xmath17 ranged from 0 to @xmath45 , which was several orders of magnitude greater than the true value of @xmath17 ; ( ii ) a _ weakly - constrained _ prior , where @xmath17 ranged from 0 to twice the true value ; and ( iii ) a _ strongly - constrained _ prior , where @xmath17 was known to within 10% of the true value .",
    "these three priors on @xmath17 correspond to no information , moderate information , and rather accurate information about the relationship between the instrumental noise levels in the @xmath2 and @xmath4 channels .",
    "for this particular analysis , the ` true ' value of @xmath17 could be estimated by @xmath46 at 0.6  mhz , using the 1.1.1a data set , since the @xmath2 channel for the 1.1.1a data contains no signal in this frequency region .",
    "this allows us to assess the performance of the analysis method as a function of our a  priori knowledge of the instrumental noise levels .",
