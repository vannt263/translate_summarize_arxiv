    "the canonical picture of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the galactic disk is one in which the gas resides in multiple `` phases '' in rough pressure equilibrium with one another .",

    "these factors indicate that the broad absorption coincident with the interstellar 1032   absorption could be due to structure in the outflowing wind of the star . due to the uncertainties in modelling the stellar continuum in the region surrounding the 1032   absorption , we give a conservative upper limit to @xmath7 ( ) in table  [ ism_par ] .",
    "a useful tool for determining the column density of an absorbing species is the apparent optical depth method ( savage & sembach 1991 ) .",

    "their model follows a parcel of cooling hot gas from an initial temperature of 10@xmath13 k to a final temperature of 10@xmath66 k. the lower temperature is similar to that derived for the highly - ionized ivc toward hd  14434 .",
    "the resulting / and / ratios predicted by shapiro & moore ( 1976 ) at @xmath12 @xmath3 10@xmath66 k are 1.6 and 7.4 .",
    "the / ratio is approximately a factor of 2 too low , while the / ratio is consistent with the observations .",
    "more recently , edgar & chevalier ( 1986 ) developed a model similar to that of shapiro & moore ( 1976 ) which included updated atomic data for more species and followed the cooling gas with several assumptions regarding its evolution ( e.g. , isobaric , isochoric ) .",
    "their calculations resulted in a / ratio is a factor of 3 to 10 times larger ( depending on the assumptions ) than the observed ratio toward hd  14434 .",
    "inclusion of self - photoionization may resolve the differences between these models and the observations .",
    "future non - equilibrium calculations which include the effects of self - photoionization are needed to determine if this is a viable mechanism to explain the / ratio .",
    "another model which results in the production of and at relatively cool temperatures is that of wind - blown interstellar bubbles , whose evolution was outlined by castor , mccray , & weaver ( 1975 ) and weaver et al .",
    "stars of spectral type earlier than b2 are known to have strong stellar winds ( howarth & prinja 1989 ) .",
    "the outflowing stellar wind of a star impinges on the ambient ism and can create an interstellar bubble which have been found to be common around wolf - rayet and o - type stars ( chu et al . 1982 ; lozinskaya 1991 ; cappa & herbstmeier 2000 ) .",
    "the weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) model predicts the physical quantities associated with shells driven by the winds from early - type stars including the radius of the shell , expansion velocity , and the column density of and other highly - ionized species .",
    "comparison of the high - ion predictions of the weaver et al .",
    "model and the following parameters for the model : an ambient interstellar density , @xmath70 = 1 @xmath71 , and a typical age of an interstellar bubble , @xmath72 myr ( cappa & herbstmeier 2000 ) . ] with the properties of the highly - ionized ivc toward hd  14434 , assuming it is associated with a wind - blown bubble , results in a / ratio @xmath3 16 which is a factor of 4 too large .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the presence of a weaver - type bubble can not be responsible for the observed highly - ionized ivc toward hd  14434 .    the derived temperature ( @xmath12 @xmath3 10@xmath66  k ) and turbulent velocity ( @xmath57 @xmath3 12 km s@xmath5 ) of the ivc are typical of gas found in galactic h  ii regions ( reynolds 1991 ) .",
    "the low temperature , in particular , suggests that photoionization may play a role in the origin of the high ions toward hd  14434 .",
    "we used the photoionization equilibrium code cloudy ( v94 ; ferland 1996 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) to invesigate the possibility that photoionization may explain the observed properties of the ivc seen toward hd  14434 .",
    "we considered two photoionization scenarios : ( @xmath73 ) the ivc is associated with a normal region surrounding hd  14434 ; ( @xmath74 ) the ivc has been ionized by emission from a hot , thermal plasma .",
    "following howk & savage ( 1999 ) , a suite of single - star region models were computed using cloudy and the stellar parameters in table  [ star_par ] . for simplicity , we assume that x - rays emitted by the stellar wind can be modelled as an equilibrium plasma at @xmath75  k with an intensity normalized such that @xmath76  k ( e.g. , cassinelli et al .",
    "the results of these models are summarized in table [ cloudy ] .",
    "all the models yield a predicted / ratio @xmath77 . this ratio could be raised by assuming lower densities , but the lowest density model in table  [ cloudy ] should already be considered extreme .",
    "we note that these models , following sembach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , assume depleted abundances appropriate for the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) of galaxy ; assuming solar system abundances would lower this ratio .",
    "thus standard region models seem unable to explain the observed properties of the gas .    finally , we investigated the ionization characteristics of a plane - parallel cloud illuminated by emission from a diffuse hot plasma .",
    "we assume an ionizing spectrum made up of a diffuse interstellar radiation field ( black 1987 ) and , following slavin & frisch ( 2002 ) , emission from a thermal plasma .",
    "the thermal plasma is chosen to have a temperature of @xmath78  k ( models 1 , 2 , and 3 ) or 7.0  k ( model 4 ) . for models 1 , 2 , and 4 ,",
    "the flux is normalized to match the observation of the diffuse x - ray background of the local bubble . for model 3 , we normalized the emission spectrum to a diffuse x - ray background with a factor - of-10 higher flux .",
    "figure  [ ion_input ] shows the spectrum of ionizing radiation was used as the source of photoionization for our cloudy models 1 and 2 .",
    "we have investigated the use of the solar system abundances ( model 1 ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) as well as the depleted abundances characteristics of the wnm described above ( models 2 , 3 , and 4 ; following sembach et al .",
    "we then calculated the combination of total hydrogen density and column density that provided the closest match to the and column densities seen in the ivc toward hd  14434 .",
    "table [ localbubble ] summarizes the properties of our photoionization models of a gas cloud illuminated by emission from a cooling hot plasma .",
    "all models match the observed / ratio for reasonable @xmath7(h ) of about 10@xmath79 @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting temperatures are within 2-@xmath11 of that derived from the and line widths .",
    "models 1 and 2 predict densities and temperatures of @xmath80 = 0.001 @xmath71 and @xmath12",
    "= 4,630 k and @xmath80 0.002 @xmath71 and @xmath12 = 6,930 k , respectively .",
    "increasing the x - ray flux ( model 3 ) results in @xmath80 = 0.016 @xmath71 and @xmath12 = 10,100 k and increasing the temperature of the emitting plasma ( model 4 ) results in @xmath80 = 0.2 @xmath71 and @xmath12 = 6,880 k. the and column densities predicted by all the models in table  [ localbubble ] agree with the observations to better than 5% .",
    "in addition , these models do not over predict the column densities of or . with the exception of model 3",
    ", the predicted / ratio does not match the observations because the ivc absorption is blended with the perseus arm absorption .",
    "however , the predicted / and / ratios are in agreement with the lower limits obtained from the observations , therefore our models do not overproduce either or .",
    "it is important to note that the values quoted for / and / assume that fe and al are depleted heavily in the models using the depleted abundances of the wnm .",
    "models 1 , 2 , and 4 result in p / k @xmath10 340 k @xmath71 , significantly lower than the average pressure for interstellar clouds p / k @xmath3 2500 k @xmath71 ( jenkins & tripp 2001 ) .",
    "lower pressures are not unexpected because models of @xmath81 for warm neutral cloud halos ( andersson & wannier 1993 ) predict @xmath81 @xmath82 1000 k @xmath71 at the height of per  ob1 above the galactic plane .",
    "we note that the x - ray flux could be stronger in this active region of the galaxy than in the solar neighborhood .",
    "our model 3 investigates such an increase in the x - ray flux and results in p / k = 2900 k @xmath71 , as expected from jenkins & tripp ( 2001 ) .",
    "model 3 also yields a temperature which is in agreement with that observed for the ivc .",
    "note : increasing the density in model 2 to @xmath83 = -2.2 @xmath71 and @xmath7(h@xmath84 ) = 20.4 @xmath9 without increasing the radiation field results in a significantly lower / = 2.0 for the observed @xmath7 ( ) .",
    "there is excellent agreement between our hot plasma photoionization models and the observations of the ivc toward hd  14434 .",
    "thus , emission of ionizing radiation by cooling hot gas is likely to be the source of the ionization in this cloud .",
    "the cooling radiation hypothesized as the ionization source in these models could arise from a general diffuse hot - ionized medium or from the super - heated interior of a supershell in the perseus arm ( e.g. , gs139 - 03 - 69 ) .",
    "given the similarity of the / ratio in this ivc to the galactic average , an extension of our results implies that much of the galactic and absorption could arise as a result of photoionization by cooling radiation from a hot , thermal plasma .",
    "we note that @xcite have identified narrow ( warm ) components in and toward the star hd  116852 , suggesting that such absorption is not uncommon in the galaxy ( although their / ratio was significantly lower than that seen toward hd  14434 ) .",
    "further analyses of high - resolution observations of the highly - ionized ism are needed to determine if this phenomenom is common throughout the galaxy .",
    "our stis observations of hd  14434 reveal an ivc detected in and and possibly in and @xcite .",
    "the intermediate - velocity and absorption toward hd  14434 is contained in a single velocity component at a temperature of 10,450 @xmath8 3,400 k and with a non - thermal dispersion of 12.0 @xmath8 0.2 km s@xmath5 , similar to the values found for galactic h  ii regions .",
    "the observed high - ion column densities are log[@xmath7 ( ) ] = 13.34 @xmath8 0.02 @xmath9 and log[@xmath7 ( ) ] = 13.92 @xmath8 0.02 @xmath9 , which yield a / ratio of 3.8 @xmath8 0.3 that is remarkably similar to the galactic average of 4.3 @xmath8 1.9 ( sembach , savage , & tripp 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of , , and in low - temperature ( 10@xmath66  k ) gas suggests that these species are in a region dominated by photoionization .",
    "the lack of significant and absorption also support photoionization as the source of the highly - ionized ivc .",
    "our photoionization model utilizing emission from a diffuse hot plasma is in excellent agreement with our observations indicating that this is the origin of the ivc toward hd  14434 .",
    "in addition , the similarity of our / ratio with the galactic average suggests that much of the and detected in the ism could be produced from ionizing photons from a cooling hot gas .",
