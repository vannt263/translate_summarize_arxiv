    "over a dozen blazars have been detected so far at vhe energies . in the southern hemisphere , pks2155@xmath0304 is generally the brightest blazar at these energies , and is probably the best - studied at all wavelengths .",

    "the _ loose cuts _ are selected since they have a lower energy threshold and higher @xmath3-ray and background acceptance .",

    "the high flux observed from pks2155@xmath0304 allows the determination of accurate photon spectra on time scales of the order of minutes .",
