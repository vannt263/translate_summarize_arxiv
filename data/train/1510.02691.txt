    "we are concerned with the incompressible limit of solutions of multidimensional steady compressible euler equations .",
    "the steady compressible full euler equations take the form : @xmath0 while the steady homentropic euler equations have the form : @xmath1          \\mbox{div}\\,(\\rho u\\otimes u)+ \\nabla p = 0 ,      \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 with @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the flow velocity , @xmath5 is the flow speed , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 represent the density , pressure , and total energy respectively , and @xmath9 is an @xmath10 matrix .    for the full euler case , the total energy is @xmath11 with adiabatic exponent @xmath12 , the local sonic speed is @xmath13 and the mach number is @xmath14    for the homentropic case , the pressure - density relation is @xmath15 the local sonic speed is @xmath16 and the mach number is defined as @xmath17    the incompressible limit is one of the fundamental fluid dynamic limits in fluid mechanics .",
    "formally , the steady compressible full euler equations converge to the steady inhomogeneous incompressible euler equations : @xmath18 while the homentropic euler equations converge to the steady homogeneous incompressible euler equations : @xmath19              \\mbox{div}\\,(u\\otimes u)+ \\nabla p=0 .          \\end{cases }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , the rigorous justification of this limit for weak solutions has been a challenging mathematical problem , since it is a singular limit for which singular phenomena usually occur in the limit process . in particular , both the uniform estimates and the convergence of the nonlinear terms in the incompressible models are usually difficult to obtain",
    ". moreover , tracing the boundary conditions of the solutions in the limit process is a tricky problem .    generally speaking",
    ", there are two processes for the incompressible limit : the adiabatic exponent @xmath20 tending to infinity , and the mach number @xmath21 tending to zero @xcite .",
    "the latter is also called the low mach number limit . a general framework for the low mach number limit for local smooth solutions for compressible flow",
    "was established in klainerman - majda @xcite . in particular , the incompressible limit of local smooth solutions of the euler equations for compressible fluids was established with well - prepared initial data _",
    "i.e. _ , the limiting velocity satisfies the incompressible condition initially , in the whole space or torus . indeed , by analyzing the rescaled linear group generated by the penalty operator ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) , the low mach number limit can also be verified for the case of general data , for which the velocity in the incompressible fluid is the limit of the leray projection of the velocity in the compressible fluids .",
    "this method also applies to global weak solutions of the isentropic navier - stokes equations with general initial data and various boundary conditions @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , the incompressible limit on the stationary navier - stokes equations with the dirichlet boundary condition was also shown , in which the gradient estimate on the velocity played the major role . for the one - dimensional euler equations ,",
    "the low mach number limit has been proved by using the @xmath22 space in @xcite . for the limit @xmath23 , it was shown in @xcite that the compressible isentropic navier - stokes flow would converge to the homogeneous incompressible navier - stokes flow .",
    "later , the similar limit from the korteweg barotropic navier - stokes model to the homogeneous incompressible navier - stokes model was also considered in @xcite .    for the steady flow ,",
    "the uniqueness of weak solutions of the steady incompressible euler equations is still an open issue .",
    "thus , the incompressible limit of the steady euler equations becomes more fundamental mathematically ; it may serve as a selection principle of physical relevant solutions for the steady incompressible euler equations since a weak solution should not be regarded as the compressible perturbation of the steady incompressible euler flow in general . furthermore , for the general domain , it is quite challenging to obtain directly a uniform estimate for the leray projection of the velocity in the compressible fluids .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate a suitable compactness framework for weak solutions with weak uniform bounds with respect to the adiabatic exponent @xmath20 by employing the weak convergence argument .",
    "one of our main observations is that the compactness can be achieved by using only natural weak estimates for the mass conservation and the vorticity , which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "another observation is that the incompressibility of the limit for the homentropic euler flow follows directly from the continuity equation , while the incompressibility of the limit for the full euler flow is from a combination of all the euler equations .",
    "finally , we find a suitable framework to satisfy the boundary condition without the strong gradient estimates on the velocity . as direct applications of the compactness framework",
    ", we establish two incompressible limit theorems for multidimensional steady euler flows through infinitely long nozzles . as a consequence",
    ", we can establish the new existence theorems for the corresponding problems for multidimensional steady incompressible euler equations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we establish the compactness framework for the incompressible limit of approximate solutions of the steady full euler equations and the homentropic euler equations in @xmath24 with @xmath25 . in  3 , we give a direct application of the compactness framework to the full euler flow through infinitely long nozzles in @xmath26 . in  4 , the incompressible limit of homentropic euler flows in the three - dimensional infinitely long axisymmetric nozzle is established .",
    "in this section , we establish the compensated compactness framework for approximate solutions of the steady euler equations in @xmath27 with @xmath3 .",

    "the distributional functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , here present possible error terms from different types of approximation . if @xmath28 with @xmath34 are the exact solutions of the steady euler flows , @xmath35 , are both equal to zero .",
    "moreover , the same remark is true for the full euler case , where @xmath36 , are the distributional functions as introduced in .",
