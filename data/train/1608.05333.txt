    "frustration in magnetic systems occurs by competing exchange interactions and leads frequently to disordered spin - liquid states @xcite .",
    "recent progress in understanding transition metal oxides with orbital degrees of freedom demonstrated many unusual properties of systems with active @xmath0 degrees of freedom  they are characterized by anisotropic hopping @xcite which generates ising - like orbital interactions @xcite , similar to the orbital superexchange in @xmath1 systems @xcite . particularly challenging are @xmath2 and @xmath3 transition metal oxides , where the interplay between strong electron correlations and spin - orbit interaction leads to several novel phases @xcite . in iridates",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is so strong that spins and orbital operators combine to new @xmath4 pseudospins at each site @xcite , and interactions between these pseudospins decide about the magnetic order in the ground state .",
    "the @xmath5iro@xmath6 ( @xmath7=na , li ) family of honeycomb iridates has attracted a lot of attention as these compounds have @xmath0 orbital degree of freedom and lie close to the exactly solvable @xmath4 kitaev model @xcite .",
    "this model has a number of remarkable features , including the absence of any symmetry breaking in its quantum kitaev spin - liquid ( ksl ) ground state , with gapless majorana fermions @xcite and extremely short - ranged spin correlations @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that below we call a ksl also disordered spin - liquid states which arise near the kitaev points in presence of perturbing heisenberg interactions @xmath8 .    by analyzing possible couplings between the kramers",
    "doublets it was proposed that the microscopic model adequate to describe the honeycomb iridates includes kitaev interactions accompanied by heisenberg exchange in form of the kitaev - heisenberg ( kh ) model @xcite . soon after the experimental evidence was presented that several features of the observed zigzag order are indeed captured by the kh model @xcite .",
    "its parameters for @xmath5iro@xmath6 compounds are still under debate at present @xcite .",
    "one finds also a rather unique crossover from the quasiparticle states to a non - fermi liquid behavior by varying the frustrated interactions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , it was recently realized that this model does not explain the observed direction of magnetic moments in na@xmath9iro@xmath6 and its extension is indeed necessary to describe the magnetic order in real materials @xcite .",
    "for example , bond - anisotropic interactions associated with the trigonal distortions have to play a role to explain the differences between na@xmath9iro@xmath6 and li@xmath9iro@xmath6 @xcite , the two compounds with quite different behavior reminiscent of the unsolved problem of nanio@xmath9 and linio@xmath9 in spin - orbital physics @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the kh model might be applicable in another honeycomb magnet @xmath10-rucl@xmath6 , see e.g. a recent study of its spin excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "understanding the consequences of frustrated heisenberg interactions on the honeycomb lattice is very challenging and has stimulated several studies @xcite .",
    "the kh model itself is highly nontrivial and poses an even more interesting problem in the theory @xcite : kitaev term alone has intrinsic frustration due to directional ising - like interactions between the spin components selected by the bond direction @xcite . in addition , these interactions are disturbed by nearest neighbor heisenberg exchange which triggers long - range order ( lro ) sufficiently far from the kitaev points @xcite . in general , ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) interactions coexist and the phase diagram of the kh model is quite rich as shown in several previous studies @xcite .",
    "finally , the kh model has also a very interesting phase diagram on the triangular lattice @xcite . these studies motivate better understanding of quantum effects in the kh model on the honeycomb lattice in the full range of its competing interactions .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to revisit the phase diagram of the kh model and to investigate it further by combining exact diagonalization ( ed ) result @xcite with the self - consistent cluster mean field theory ( cmft ) , supplemented by the insights from the linear spin - wave ( lsw ) theory and the second  order perturbation theory ( sopt ) .",
    "the main advantage of cmft is that it goes beyond a single site mean field classical theory and gives not only the symmetry - broken states with lro , but also includes partly quantum fluctuations , namely the ones within the considered clusters @xcite . in this way",
    "the treatment is more balanced and may allow for disordered states in cases when frustration of interactions dominates .",
    "we present below a complete cmft treatment of the phase diagram which includes also the kitaev term in mf part of the hamiltonian and covers the entire parameter space ( in contrast to the earlier prototype version of cmft calculation on a single hexagon for the kh model @xcite ) .",
    "note that the cmft complements the ed which is unable to get symmetry breaking for a finite system , but nevertheless can be employed to investigate the phase transitions in the present kh model by evaluating the second derivative of the ground state energy to identify phase transitions by its characteristic maxima @xcite .",
    "ed result can be also used to recognize the type of magnetic order by transforming to reciprocal space and computing spin - structure factor .",

    ", width=309 ]    it is clearly visible that all the methods that include quantum fluctuations give quantum versions of the four classically established magnetic phases : nel , zigzag , fm and stripy . as the most important effect we note that when quantum fluctuations are included within a classical phase , the energy is generally lowered and that the emerging phase is expected to expand beyond the classical boundaries , but only in case if a phase which competes with it has weaker quantum fluctuations",
    "this implies that phases of af nature will expand at the expense of the fm ones as the latter phases have lower energy gains by quantum fluctuations ( which even vanish exactly for the fm order at @xmath67 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "we summarize the phase boundaries obtained within different methods in table [ table1 ] .",

    "the most prominent feature in the phase diagram described above is however the difference in size between two ksl regions , already addressed before using ed @xcite and also visible now in the cmft data .",
    "therefore , the cmft result supports the claim from ref .",

    "we start the discussion of quantum corrections to the energy of the ordered phases by noting that , even though it properly captures finite order parameters , the cmft looses quantum energy on the external bonds and does not therefore provide a reliable estimate of the ground - state energy . instead",

    "sz24](a ) ] will be treated as a reference value .",

    "[ sz24](a ) .",
    "in contrast , the phases neighboring to the fm spin liquid  fm and stripy  would reach the value of @xmath116 only at the fm kitaev point with @xmath117 and away from this point the contribution of quantum fluctuations decreases rapidly allowing for large extent of the fm spin - liquid phase .",
    "note , that both these latter phases contain a point which is exactly fluctuation free  for fm phase when frustration is absent ( @xmath67 ) , and for stripy phase it is related to the fm one by the interaction transformation @xcite at @xmath118 .",
    "moving to the cmft energy analysis ( green line in fig .",
    "[ sz24](a ) ) one should also keep in mind that within the cmft method the external bonds between @xmath119 and @xmath120 do not include quantum fluctuations fully .",
    "this implies worse estimate of the energy for regions of the phase space that allow quantum fluctuations . as a consequence",
    "the region of stability of fm spin - liquid phase is smaller than that obtained in the ed .",
    "finally , the estimates obtained from lsw , which represents a harmonic approximation to the quantum fluctuations , are typically better than those from the cmft but not as good as those from sopt , see dashed red lines in fig .",
    "[ sz24](a ) .",
    "as expected , the lsw energy fits well with ed curve for fm and stripy phases with less quantum fluctuations and starts to diverge when beyond quantum phase transitions within nel and zigzag phases .      as usual",
    ", getting the correct value of the ordered moment turns out to be a more difficult task than estimating the ground state energy .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the ed does not capture the symmetry - broken states and the ordered moment can only be indirectly extracted from the @xmath121 ; moreover , the sopt may not be reliable here .",
    "hence , we are mostly left with the results obtained with cmft and lsw .",
    "we discuss the corresponding data [ shown in fig .",
    "[ sz24](b ) ] together with the several values given already in the literature .",
    "let us begin with the heisenberg af point @xmath77 : here it is expected that the ordered moment should be strongly reduced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "lsw approximation estimates the ordered moment value at @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "similar values were extracted from @xmath121 in quantum monte carlo ( @xmath123 @xcite ) and ed calculations ( @xmath124 @xcite ) . in the last case",
    "however the authors admit that the set of clusters for finite size scaling was chosen so as to make the best agreement with quantum monte carlo . another method",
    " series expansion ( high order perturbation theory ) @xcite sets ordered moment value at a somewhat higher value of @xmath125 .",
    "while all the above results seem roughly consistent , cmft value seems to stand out ( @xmath126 for @xmath77 ) .",
    "nevertheless , one should note that the ordered moment estimated from @xmath121 for 24site cluster ed equals @xmath127 @xcite which is above the cmft value .",
    "this suggests that at this point the finite size scaling is important .    before transferring to the frustrated regime",
    "we briefly mention that the the trivial ordered moment value at @xmath128 is here correctly reproduced by both cmft and lsw . besides , for the regions around the fluctuation ",
    "free fm ( and stripy ) point the ordered moments predicted by cmft and lsw also match .",
    "following the ground state energy analysis , lsw gives the correct result because quantum fluctuations contribution is small compared to the classical state .",
    "the further we move towards the kitaev points , however , the more incorrect the lsw approximation should be because of the strong reduction of the ordered moment due to the growing frustration .",
    "in contrast , the lack of quantum fluctuations on the external bonds makes cmft steadily biased except for fm and stripy phases .",
    "however , since for the internal part of the cluster the fluctuations are still fully included , the frustration should be well handled and cmft should give more predictable results than lsw in frustrated parts of the phase diagram .",
    "here it is also important to stress , that the series expansion captures correctly the fluctuation ",
    "free point at @xmath128 ( fm ) and @xmath129 ( stripy ) and predicts a broader region of fm ksl phase @xcite .",
    "the order parameter is also qualitatively correctly estimated and is reduced more to @xmath130 for both nel and zigzag phases @xcite .",
    "however , while the ordered moment values obtained by cmft are consistent with the four  sublattice dual transformation , the ordered moment data from the high  order perturbation theory @xcite are not , as the ordered moment values differ at the points connected by the mapping .",
    "unfortunately the largest difference appears near the fm lro / ksl boundaries .",
    "this observation uncovers certain limits of the high  order perturbation theory .",
    "let us conclude the discussion of the quantum corrections with the following more general observation : developing the argumentation presented by iregui , corboz , and troyer @xcite , the dependence of the quantum correction to the energy and to the ordered moment on the angle @xmath21 suggests that the kitaev interaction is less `` compatible '' with the fm / stripy ground states than with the nel / zigzag ones . this can be understood in the simple picture of the kh model on a 4-site segment of the honeycomb lattice consisting of three bonds attached to a selected lattice site , as presented below .",
    "starting with @xmath128 ( fm ground state .",
    "e.g. along the @xmath14 quantization axis ) and increasing @xmath21 leads to an addition of the fm kitaev term , which favors fm - aligned spins along the @xmath32 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 quantization axes for the @xmath32 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 directional bonds , respectively . it can easily be seen that , e.g. for the @xmath32 bond , the eigenstate of the fm kitaev - only hamiltonian on that bond ( @xmath131 ) has a @xmath132 overlap with the fm ground state , @xmath133 .",
    "in contrast , while a similar situation happens for the @xmath13 bond , for the @xmath14 bond there is a @xmath134 overlap between such states .",
    "next , we perform a similar analysis for @xmath77 and firstly assume that we have a _ classical _ ground state . in this case for the `` unsatisfied '' bonds from the point of view of the increasing af kitaev interaction we also obtain that the eigenstate of the af kitaev - only hamiltonian ( @xmath135 ) on that bond has a @xmath132 overlap with the classical nel ground state  e.g. : @xmath136 . however , this situation changes once we consider that the spin quantum fluctuations dress the classical nel ground state",
    ". this can be best understood if we assumed the unrealistic but insightful case of very strong quantum fluctuations destroying the classical nel ground state : then for the @xmath32 bond a singlet could be stabilized and the overlap between such a state and the state `` favored '' by the kitaev term increases to @xmath137 : @xmath138 .",
    "this suggests that the nel ground state , which _ contains _ quantum spin fluctuations , is more `` compatible '' with the states `` favored '' by the kitaev terms than the fm ground state , resulting in more stable values of ordered moment for nel phase .",

    "as the main result , the present study uncovers a fundamental difference between the onset of broken symmetry phases in the vicinity of kitaev points with antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "while the spin liquids obtained at @xmath78 and @xmath80 are strictly equivalent and can be transformed one into the other in the absence of heisenberg interactions ( at @xmath117 ) , spin excitations and quantum phase transitions emerging at finite @xmath16 are very different in both cases . for antiferromagnetic kitaev",

    "if one recalls that the equivalent of one iteration in linearized version of cmft is in fact multiplication by @xmath195 , one can easily see that large negative @xmath180 would cause oscillations with an exponentially growing amplitude when performing the iterations of the self - consistent loop . to overcome this issue",

    "it is evident that the ordered patterns suggested by linearization were reproduced by cmft within regions dictated by the maximal @xmath181 .",
