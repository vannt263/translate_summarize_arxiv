    "in regge phenomenology @xcite , the pomeron is introduced as an even reggeon with vacuum quantum numbers and the intercept of its regge trajectory higher than unity .",
    "any reggeon is defined as an analytic continuation of some set of bound states and resonances to the region of complex values of the spin .",
    "many meson reggeons emerging in the quark model have already got their identification via association with experimentally observed hadron states @xcite:@xmath1-reggeon ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons ) , @xmath4-reggeon ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons),@xmath7-reggeon , @xmath8-reggeon , @xmath9-reggeon , @xmath10-reggeon , _ etc . _",
    "all meson regge trajectories have intercepts noticeably lower than unity . as a consequence ,",
    "high - energy diffractive scattering of hadrons is dominated by pomeron interaction .",
    "in particular , the representation of elastic scattering amplitude in terms of pomeron exchanges yields a satisfactory description of the nucleon - nucleon diffractive pattern at ultrahigh collision energies and low momentum transfers @xcite.however , being one of the most important objects of strong interaction physics ( the main carrier of strong interaction in the high - energy diffraction domain ) , the pomeron has not been discovered yet .",
    "the question _ `` which of the observed @xmath11 states , if any , is the ground state of the pomeron ? '' _ still waits for proper answer .    from the practical standpoint , true identification of the pomeron",
    "is possible only through estimation of the partial decay widths and branching ratios of its real states ( even - spin resonances ) .",
    "presumably , the pomeron resonance decays to pairs `` hadron - antihadron '' are driven by the same functions as the pomeron coupling to the corresponding hadrons in high - energy diffractive scattering ( see the appendix ) .",
    "if we knew the analytic structure of these functions , we would be able to calculate the partial decay widths of the pomeron real states .",
    "unfortunately , at its present stage of development , qcd does not help to solve the problem .",
    "nevertheless , some relevant information can be extracted from the available experimental data on meson - proton scattering . in this eprint",
    ", we will make an attempt to identify the ground state of the pomeron , searching for interrelation between the high - energy hadron diffraction data and the measured characteristics of observed @xmath11 resonances .",
    "for example , in the framework of the dl model @xcite , the ratio of the kaon - proton and pion - proton total cross - sections is approximately equal ( up to secondary reggeon contributions ) to the ratio of the pomeron couplings to the corresponding mesons in forward scattering . at @xmath12 gev (",
    "the highest reached energy for @xmath13 scattering ) , the impact of secondary reggeons on the quantity @xcite @xmath14 is minimal . as the partial decay width of the pomeron ground state to pair of scalar mesons is proportional to the squared absolute value of the corresponding meson - pomeron coupling , so , using ( [ dlrat ] ) ,",
    "we obtain a qualitative estimation @xmath15    this value is consistent with the @xmath0 resonance branching ratio @xmath16 extracted from the the belle collaboration data on the quantities @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "such a proportion between the partial decay widths could be considered characteristic for any @xmath19 singlet . on the other hand , in the @xmath20 plane , @xmath0 resonance is located very close to the dl pomeron regge trajectory , @xmath21 @xcite , widely used in phenomenology . therefore , it may be considered as a promising candidate for the pomeron ground state .",
    "however , @xmath11 hadrons different from @xmath0 should not be immediately excluded from the consideration .",
    "of course , the observed smallness of the branching ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite allows to consider resonances @xmath2 and @xmath24 as mesons of certain quark - antiquark content and to relate them to secondary reggeons , but the current interpretation of other well - established @xmath11 resonances ( namely , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xcite ) is not so clear . to distinguish reliably the pomeron spin-2 state among various vacuum resonances of the same spin",
    ", we need more information on the pomeron dynamics in both the spacelike and timelike domains .",
    "first , let us estimate the pomeron coupling to light mesons in the diffractive scattering regime .",
    "in the leading approximation , the angular distributions in @xmath28 and @xmath29 elastic scattering can be calculated in the same way as for @xmath30 scattering ( see @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mandelstam variables , @xmath36 is the impact parameter , @xmath37 gev@xmath38 , @xmath39 is the regge trajectory of the pomeron , @xmath40 is the pomeron coupling to proton , and @xmath41 is the pomeron coupling to the incoming meson . at @xmath42 ,",
    "the pomeron regge trajectory and the pomeron coupling to proton are approximated by the same test functions as in nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite , @xmath43 where the free parameters take on the values presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "such a choice of parametrization for @xmath39 is in part specified by the qcd - motivated asymptotic behavior of the pomeron regge trajectory @xcite , @xmath44 and by the conditions @xmath45 which originate from the dispersion relations for regge trajectories @xcite and are expected to be valid for any reggeon . ) in no way deserve serious consideration .",
    "these expressions should be treated just as some nonanalytic quantitative approximations ( valid at low negative @xmath35 only ) to the corresponding true dynamic functions whose analytic structure is still unknown . ]",

    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     -0.2 cm    in view of the fact that the pomeron coupling to vector mesons is `` spin - blind '' ( schc ) and comparable to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we could expect the existence of some likeness between the pomeron interactions of vector and scalar mesons and , so , expect a similar weakness of the@xmath35-dependence of the pomeron coupling to light scalar mesons , though this expectation should be considered as just an assumption , until final solution of the above - mentioned secondary reggeon problem is achieved .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 allow to estimate the pomeron coupling to real photons .",

    "other contributions can be roughly taken into account via introduction of the pole - like term @xmath57 , where @xmath58 gev , so that the full amplitude is approximated as ( the solid line in fig .",

    "hence , we do not expect that the underestimation of the pomeron coupling to photon which emerges under fitting @xmath62 to the data is higher than 20% of this parameter , since the pomeron interaction of the heavier vector mesons is not expected to be stronger than of @xmath53 meson .",
    "so and thus , we obtain the following estimation of @xmath63 : @xmath64 ^ 2\\,g_{vv\\rm p}(0)+\\kappa\\,g_a(0)\\;\\;\\;\\;\\left(1<\\kappa<1.2\\right)\\ , . \\label{gaspace}\\ ] ]",
    "reggeon coupling to light mesons in the diffraction and resonance domains is driven by the same structure functions ( see formulae ( a.3 ) and ( a.4 ) of the appendix ) .",
    "although these formulae are initially derived for spinless particles , they can be adapted to vector mesons and photons .",
    "let us formulate _ the comparability assumption _ which underlies the further discussion :    * the pomeron coupling to light mesons in the resonance region is comparable or even approximately equal to its coupling to the corresponding particles in the diffractive scattering regime . in particular , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the pomeron ground state mass .    though this assumption is highly nontrivial ( due to the high sensitivity of the resonance partial decay width to the value of its coupling to the decay products ) , it does not seem to be exceptional .",
    "for example , as applied to @xmath4-mesons @xcite , formula ( a.4 ) yields @xmath67 from the physical standpoint , such a weak @xmath35-dependence just implies that the corresponding reggeon perceives pions ( and , possibly , some other mesons ) as pointlike particles .",
    "regarding the pomeron spin-2 resonance decays to pairs of light vector mesons or photons , the comparability assumption supplemented by the above - mentioned schc hypothesis ( which is valid in the diffraction region ) implies the dominance of the only orbital mode : @xmath68 .",
    "other orbital modes are related to helicity amplitudes conjugated to the spin - flip vertices in pomeron exchanges .",
    "hence , they are expected to be dynamically supressed on the same reasons as the spin - flip amplitudes in the high - energy diffractive scattering .",
    "consequently , in the case of pomeron interaction , formula ( a.4 ) is applicable , as well , to the decays to pairs of vector mesons or photons ( of course , the spin-2 resonance decays to pairs of scalar mesons take place in the @xmath69 orbital mode only ) .",
    "let us try to describe the @xmath0 resonance observables with the help of the above - stated assumption .",
    "for example , the constant related to the pomeron ground state decay to two real photons of different polarization can be estimated as @xmath70 inserting @xmath71 gev @xcite into ( a.4 ) , we come to the following result : @xmath72 in addition , with the help of estimations ( [ pipo ] ) and ( [ kapo ] ) , we predict @xmath73 and , then , in view of @xmath74 mev @xcite , obtain @xmath75 while the corresponding experimental values are @xcite @xmath76    the same procedure applied to @xmath26 resonance ( @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 mev @xcite ) yields the estimation @xmath79 which catastrophically diverges from the belle data @xcite : @xmath80 this inconsistency allows to exclude @xmath26 resonance from the candidates for the pomeron ground state .",
    "unfortunately , analogous data for @xmath25 and @xmath27 resonances @xcite are currently unavailable .",
    "so and thus , direct propagation of the pomeron couplings @xmath81 and @xmath82 from the diffraction to resonance region yields a correct estimation of @xmath83 .    the model and experimental estimations of @xmath84 overlap as well ,",
    "but the significant systematic uncertainties @xcite not included into the presented value ( [ belledecay ] ) make this result not so impressive .",
    "a quite independent argument in favor of our reasoning is the @xmath0 resonance location in the @xmath20 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ tra ] ) , which allows a smooth linkage between the linear chew - frautschi plot and the nonlinear regge trajectory of the pomeron ( [ pomeron ] ) extracted from the nucleon - nucleon scattering data .",
    "this coincidence encourages to consider more seriously the possibility of the @xmath0 resonance correspondence to the pomeron ground state , since other observed @xmath11 resonances do not seem to be so good candidates .",
    "= 8.1cm=8.1 cm    of course , at present , the discussed coincidences should be qualified just as some noteworthy indications . for a firm conclusion",
    ", we need new and , if possible , more accurate data on both the @xmath0 resonance observables and the @xmath85 and @xmath13 scattering at higher energies .",
    "another prediction which should be checked is the opposite polarization of the photons in @xmath86 decays which follows from the predicted above dominance of the @xmath68 orbital mode .",
    "in fact , the possible physical consequences of the presumed comparability are much deeper than just a practical feasibility of the pomeron identification . in the euclidean domain ,",
    "the behavior like \\{@xmath87 , @xmath88 } is characteristic for glueball reggeons ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "if the assumption is correct , then the pomeron is expected to keep its glueball nature in the resonance region as well . in other words , if the predictions , regarding the @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 decays , are confirmed , we would have enough grounds _ to consider @xmath0 resonance as not only the pomeron ground state , but the lightest tensor glueball_.    the idea that @xmath0 resonance as a glueball is , certainly , not new .",
    "although its mass is significantly lower than the predictions by lattice qcd @xcite , it is discussed as a glueball candidate from time to time , as because of the high value of its decay width @xcite , so due to some features of the high - energy @xmath92 differential cross - sections @xcite .",
    "the author is indebted to his colleagues from the ihep division of theoretical physics for helpful discussions .",
    "let us consider the elastic interaction of two scalar mesons via exchange by single virtual spin-@xmath93 particle .",
    "the contribution of such exchange to the born amplitude can be represented as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the spin-@xmath93 particle propagator , @xmath96 ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the mass and decay width of the corresponding resonance ) , @xmath99 are the currents of the scalar mesons , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the 4-momenta of the incoming particles , and @xmath102 is the transferred 4-momentum .",
    "obviously , in the kinematic range @xmath103 ( a.1 ) transforms into @xmath104\\ , , \\eqno{(\\rm a.2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 are the structure functions at the tensor structure @xmath106 in the currents @xmath107 and @xmath108 gev@xmath38 is a scale ( unit of measurement ) characteristic for hadron physics .",
    "the last expression can be used for derivation of the appropriate reggeon exchange contribution to the born amplitude for high - energy elastic diffractive scattering ( see @xcite or , say , the appendix of @xcite ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 , the function @xmath111 is the corresponding regge trajectory , and @xmath112 is the so - called reggeon signature factor ( @xmath113 for even reggeons and @xmath114 for odd reggeons ) .    to consider the two - scalar - meson decay of a spin-@xmath93 resonance state associated with some reggeon we need to continue ( a.1 ) analytically outside of the @xmath34-channel physical range . if @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , then , in view of the general properties of @xmath119 at @xmath120 ( the transversality with respect to @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) and the tracelessness with respect to any pair of lorentz indices like @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) , we obtain the following expression for the resonance partial decay width : @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
