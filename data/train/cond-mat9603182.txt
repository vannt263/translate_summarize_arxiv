    "the description of the measurement process has been a topic debated from the early developments of quantum mechanics @xcite . besides being a basic issue in the interpretation of the quantum formalism",
    "it has also a practical interest in predicting the results of experiments pointing out some paradoxical aspects of the quantum laws when compared to the classical ones .",
    "the development of devices whose noise figures are close to the quantum limit makes these experiments within the technological feasibility and demands for a systematization of the theory of quantum measurement with deeper understanding of its experimental implications @xcite .    in ordinary quantum mechanics measurements are taken into account by postulating the wave function collapse @xcite .",
    "this approach has the unpleasant feature of introducing an extra assumption in the theory which , moreover , regards only instantaneous and perfect measurements . in the last twenty years",
    "relevant steps have been made in upgrading the von neumann postulate with more realistic and satisfactory approaches .",
    "these approaches essentially recognize that a measured system is not isolated but in interaction with a measurement apparatus .",
    "the way this basic fact is taken into account in the evolution law of the measured system has been developed according to different languages and points of view .",
    "a group algebra approach to the problem of an open quantum system was proposed by postulating ( completely positive ) semigroup properties for the dynamical law of a system in interaction with a markovian environment @xcite . in this case",
    "the open system is described by a semigroup master equation later successfully used in modeling quantum optics experiments @xcite .",
    "the semigroup master equation , still preserving positivity and trace of the density matrix operator , introduces decoherentization by dynamically quenching the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , a key property used to explain the absence of superposition states in a measurement apparatus @xcite or in a general macroscopic system @xcite thought as systems interacting with an environment .",
    "open quantum systems were gathered to measured systems by obtaining an all alike semigroup master equation for a continuous measurement process @xcite modeled by repeated instantaneous effect - valued measurements @xcite , i.e. , partial localization or decoherentization kicks @xcite given to the density matrix at random values of the measured observable .",
    "in the model @xcite the semigroup master equation comes out only after averaging the instantaneous results of the measured observable with probability distribution in agreement with standard quantum mechanics @xcite . in absence of this",
    "average , i.e. , for a particular _ selection _ of the measurement outcomes , a nonlinear stochastic differential equation was proposed to describe the evolution of the density matrix during a continuous measurement process @xcite . since in this case during the measurement process the density matrix coincides with its square , a nonlinear stochastic differential equation could be derived for the corresponding wave function @xcite crowning previous attempts to include the lders postulate @xcite , a generalization of the von neumann one to _ selective _ measurements , into a stochastic schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "this equation , obtained also in the framework of the quantum filtering theory @xcite , is a special case of the more general quantum state diffusion equation for open systems @xcite .",
    "its nonlinearity can be avoided only renouncing to make predictions on the outcome of the measured observable .",
    "indeed , a linear stochastic differential equation was proposed for the so called _ a posteriori _ states @xcite , i.e. , those unnormalized states which describe the quantum system when the measurement result is already known .",
    "as originally suggested by feynman @xcite the path integral approach to quantum mechanics is a quite appropriate framework for incorporating the effect of a measurement .",
    "the hint was picked up by modeling a continuous measurement of position having a certain result ( selective measurement ) by a restriction of the feynman path integral @xcite .",
    "the method was extended to measurements of a generic observable , function of momentum and position , by a restriction of the quantum propagator in the phase - space formulation @xcite .",
    "the restriction was originally proposed as a gaussian functional damping the paths proportionally to the time - averaged squared difference between the value taken by the observable on the paths and the measurement result , normalized to a given variance @xcite . however , the corresponding quantum propagator has desirable dynamical semigroup properties if the gaussian restriction is chosen linear in time @xcite which is equivalent to make the previously proposed variance scaling with the inverse of the measurement time @xcite .",
    "the modifications introduced in the quantum propagator by the restricted path integral approach can be incorporated into an effective hamiltonian depending on the selected measurement result .",
    "an effective wave equation was then derived which is linear in the wave function if the selected measurement result is considered known @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the selected measurement result is to be determined according to the evolution of the measured system the effective wave equation is read as a nonlinear stochastic differential equation .",
    "equivalence to the previously proposed stochastic equations occurs @xcite .",
    "the selective constraint imposed to the restricted path integral approach can be removed by summing over all possible measurement outcomes . in this way a nonselective process described by a density matrix was obtained @xcite .",
    "the effect of the interaction with the measurement apparatus modifies the corresponding quantum propagator through an influence functional @xcite which turns out to be equivalent to those obtained with other methods @xcite .    from the above incomplete list of approaches ,",
    "apart from an evident difference in the languages , a rather unified picture of the problem of quantum measurement emerges .",
    "it deserves uprising to the systematic theory of a quantum system evolving under the effect of a measurement process .",
    "such theory , named , for brevity , measurement quantum mechanics , is formally presented in section ii .    a less formal introduction to measurement quantum mechanics is attainable through the analysis of a model of measurement device which is rather general .",
    "this is important not only as a justification of the formal approach to the theory but , above all , for clearly defining the meaning of a measurement in relation to the observer .",
    "as noted by cini @xcite paradoxical features arise from not considering the objective role of the observer in a measurement process .",
    "the evolution of a measured system in interaction with a measurement apparatus can not depend on the observer looking or not at the pointer of the apparatus . in order to take into account such objectivity",
    "the measurement apparatus must be classical with respect to the observer @xcite . in section iii",
    "we propose a simple model of measurement apparatus shaped as an environment of particles linearly interacting with the measured system and in contact with a heat reservoir at a fixed temperature @xcite . in the high temperature limit",
    "the particles behave as an informational environment which extracts information in objective way . noticeably",
    ", the formal structure of measurement quantum mechanics is obtained in the same limit .",
    "a further analysis of measurement quantum mechanics is given in section iv in connection to a recent optical experiment @xcite showing quantum zeno effect .",
    "comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical predictions indicate that the experiment @xcite was performed in a regime of very strong coupling of the measurement apparatus with the measured system .",
    "repetition of this experiment or similar ones in a weaker coupling regime is desirable for investigating interesting quantum features .",
    "some final remarks are given in section v.",
    "in this section we show the mathematical equivalence of the five approaches to the problem of measurement in quantum systems briefly described in the introduction .",
    "the demonstration is organized in steps relating neighboring pairs of approaches and giving rise to the equivalence loop sketched in fig .",
    "no one of these equivalence steps is novel .",
    "however , we reconsider all them in a unified framework and language with naturally emerging definitions for concepts as selective and nonselective measurements as well as _ a priori _ and _ a posteriori _ analysis of a measurement process . as a result",
    "we get a theory which takes into account the effect of a measurement process in ordinary quantum dynamics through a phenomenological parameter coupling the measured system to the measurement apparatus .",
