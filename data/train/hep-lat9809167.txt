    "although abelian projection has a compelling theoretical basis @xcite@xcite , and has notable sucesses @xcite in lattice simulations , there are several fundamental questions which remain unresolved.@xcite the most basic issue is the possibility that the successes of abelian projection are not consequences of our insight into the non - abelian dynamics , but simply reflect general field - theoretic principles .",
    "a closely related , more practical issue is the choice of the correct or best subgroup to use for projection . as discussed below",
    ", gauge invariance is the key physical principle responsible for the success of abelian projection ; furthermore , any subgroup , not necessarily abelian , will work as long as it contains the center of the gauge group .",
    "details are given in reference @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to abelian projection is a three step process .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath0 are associated with links of the lattice , and take on values in a compact lie group @xmath1 .",
    "an ensemble of lattice gauge field configurations is generated using standard monte carlo methods .",
    "each field configuration in the @xmath1-ensemble is placed in a particular gauge by site - based gauge transformations @xmath2 .",
    "the gauge - fixing condition is chosen to preserve gauge invariance for some subgroup @xmath3 of @xmath1 .",
    "a typical gauge - fixing procedure for abelian projection is to maximize @xmath4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a traceless , hermitian matrix that commutes with every element of the subgroup @xmath6 and the sum is taken over all links . from this ensemble of gauge - fixed field configurations ,",
    "another ensemble of gauge fields is generated , with the fields taking on values in the subgroup @xmath6 .",
    "this is obtained by maximizing @xmath7 = \\sum_{l}\\left [ \\frac{p}{2n}tr\\left ( g_{l}^{+}h_{l}+h_{l}^{+}g_{l}\\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 .    for analytical purposes ,",
    "it is necessary to generalize the projection procedure , so that a single configuration of @xmath9-fields will be associated with an ensemble of configurations of both @xmath10-fields and @xmath11-fields .",
    "the original fields @xmath12 are replaced in the gauge - fixing function and the projection function by @xmath13 . for each @xmath9-field configuration , an ensemble of @xmath11-fields will be generated , weighted by @xmath14 . for each @xmath15-field configuration , an ensemble of @xmath10-fields",
    "will be generated , weighted by @xmath16 .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 control the width of the two distributions , and the original scheme is formally regained in the limit @xmath17 , @xmath19 .",
    "the distribution of the ensemble of @xmath9-fields is independent of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the field @xmath11 is quenched relative to @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is quenched relative to both @xmath11 and @xmath9 .",
    "this quenching is necessary to preserve the normal lattice definition of gauge - invariant quantities , but introduces complications reminiscent of spin glasses into expressions for expectation values .",
    "the simplest and most analytically tractable case is projection without gauge fixing , which is achieved by setting @xmath20 . in this case , the integration over the @xmath11 fields takes any configuration overs its entire gauge orbit , thus serving to enforce gauge invariance .",
    "consider the expectation value of a wilson loop @xmath21 with no self - intersections in a representation @xmath22 of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the appropriate group character . in calculating the expectation value ,",
    "the weight function for projecting each link can be expanded in the characters of the group @xmath1 , @xmath25 \\nonumber } \\\\ & & = \\sum_{\\alpha }   d_{\\alpha } c_{\\alpha } \\left ( p\\right ) \\chi _ { \\alpha } \\left ( h^{+}g\\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the principal difficulty in the evaluation of the expected value lies in the treatment of factors resulting from the quenching of @xmath11 .",
    "to lowest order in the character expansion , systematic application of gauge invariance at all sites along the curve @xmath21 collapses the sum into the simple result @xmath26 where the sum is over representations @xmath27 of @xmath1 .",
    "this formula has obvious physics content : the wilson loop as measured in the @xmath28 representation of @xmath6 is given as a sum of wilson loops in the irreducible representations of @xmath1 , each weighted by the number of times @xmath28 appears in @xmath29 and by a @xmath18-dependent factor which contributes to the perimeter dependence .",
    "this result can be turned into rigorous upper and lower bounds on @xmath30 with changes only in the perimeter dependence on the right - hand side of the formula .",
    "this leads immediately to area law behavior for @xmath6 , independent of @xmath18 : @xmath31 where the minimum is taken over all representations @xmath29 that have a non - zero contribution .",
    "center symmetry plays an important role here , causing many potential terms to vanish . in the case of @xmath32",
    "projected to @xmath33 , a very direct alternative proof has been given recently by ambjorn and greensite.@xcite    consider , as an example , the case of @xmath34 projected to @xmath35 .",
    "the string tension is non - zero for the half - integer representations @xmath36 due to the @xmath37 center symmetry , but not for the integer representations .",
    "a typical result is @xmath38 but @xmath39 because of string - breaking in the adjoint representation : @xmath40 .",
    "projection combined with gauge fixing ( @xmath41 is less tractable than the @xmath42 case .",
    "however , a strong - coupling expansion in @xmath17@xcite , which is convergent for sufficiently small @xmath17 , indicates similar results . the lowest order result can be obtained by expanding the @xmath20 result in @xmath18 .",
    "the form of the corrections is determined by gauge invariance . to order @xmath43 , the corrections to the area- and perimeter - dependence",
    "are determined by @xmath44 where the summation sign indicates that the decoration of @xmath45 by the staple @xmath46 is to be repeated through the entire loop for all directions orthogonal to the loop .",
    "the constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 are power series in @xmath18 and @xmath49 , beginning at order @xmath50 .",
    "these corrections are shown graphically in figure 1 . from this expression",
    ", we can see that the string tension should still satisfy @xmath31 as in the case of no gauge fixing .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath49 change the perimeter dependence of the wilson loop expectation value , but not the area dependence .",
    "gauge fixing appears here in a manner quite similar to the use of fat links , and it is likely that fat links would be numerically advantageous when projection is performed without gauge fixing .",
    "the success of abelian projection appears to have its origin in very general considerations .",
    "the key principle is local gauge invariance . ultimately , it is elitzur s theorem@xcite that ensures that observables constructed from the projected field can always be rewritten in terms of gauge - invariant observables of the underlying gauge fields .",
    "abelian dominance is not necessary .",
    "note that at no point in the arguments given above has space - time dimensionality been a consideration , a further indication that abelian projection does not depend on some particular set of important field configurations .",
    "there is one possible weak point in the gauge - fixed case : the standard gauge fixing algorithm corresponds formally to the limit @xmath51 , but the strong - coupling expansion in @xmath49 has a finite radius of convergence",
    ". these arguments will fail for large @xmath49 if there is , as seems likely , a phase transition along some critical line @xmath52 , a function of the gauge coupling @xmath28 .",
    "however , even if there is a phase transition in the gauge - variant sector , it may be that the strong - coupling region and weak - coupling region are in fact connected because the critical line has an end - point . in any event , it remains conceptually difficult to claim that confinement should be understood differently for large @xmath49 and small @xmath49 , because by construction , the underlying ensemble of non - abelian gauge fields does not depend on @xmath49 ."
