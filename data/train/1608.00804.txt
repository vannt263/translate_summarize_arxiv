    "<S> by spectrally hole burning an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of ions while applying a controlled perturbation , one can obtain spectral holes that are functionalized for maximum sensitivity to different perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use such hole burnt structures for the dispersive optical interaction with rare - earth ion dopants whose frequencies are sensitive to crystal strain due to the bending motion of a crystal cantilever . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative analysis shows that good optical sensitivity to the bending motion is obtained if a magnetic field gradient is applied across the crystal during hole burning , and that the resulting opto - mechanical coupling strength is sufficient for observing quantum features such as zero point vibrations .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability to control and probe physical systems at the quantum mechanical level has been demonstrated in a variety of examples , ranging from single photons and atoms , over currents and voltages in electronic circuits to the motion of mechanical devices . </S>",
    "<S> many of these systems are promising candidates for sensitive and high precision measurements and for transmission , processing and storage of quantum information , but one single system is typically not adequate for all of these functions . </S>",
    "<S> this has spurred the interest in so - called hybrid system @xcite which combine physical components which are separately optimized for different tasks . outside the technical challenge of handling physically very different systems in a single laboratory experiment </S>",
    "<S> , the mismatch of their physical properties ( resonance excitation frequencies , spatial overlap , and coherence time scales ) presents a main obstacle against the efficient transfer of quantum states between them . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , single atoms have microscopic dipole moments and interact only weakly with physical observables of mesoscopic quantum systems which occupy orders of magnitude larger spatial volumes . one successful remedy to this weak coupling is to use ensembles of many atomic particles with correspondingly increased coherent coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> this is , indeed , the rationale behind the use of atomic ensembles for optical interfaces and memories and of spin ensembles in conjunction with superconducting circuits  @xcite . in this article , we address the application of rare - earth ion doped crystals for hybrid quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> such crystals have found rich applications in quantum communication protocols where their strong inhomogeneous broadening is favorable for speed and bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> one particular hybrid technology which holds promise for an efficient coupling between radically different degrees of freedom relies on opto - mechanical interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> major achievements such as the ability to prepare a mechanical oscillator in the quantum ground state  @xcite have spurred ambitious goals to prepare non - classical states of motion and use such systems in precision measurements and quantum information applications . </S>",
    "<S> while mechanical oscillators can be coupled via light beams to other systems , such as atomic ensembles  @xcite we propose a simpler set - up in which the bending motion of an inorganic crystal is coupled to the optical transitions in an ensemble of rare - earth ion dopants in the same crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal strain generated by the harmonic motion of a bulk mechanical oscillation provides an intrinsically stable coupling to the dopant optical properties as , contrary to other coupling mechanisms to externally imposed fields , it circumvents instabilities arising from drifts in position of field source and oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> weak strain coupling to single emitters has been previously observed  @xcite , but using a rare - earth ions ensemble , we benefit from their strong collective coupling as well as their narrow homogeneous linewidths and long coherence times , allowing unambiguous observations of quantum features .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest to use spectral hole burning to prepare a transmission window with no optical absorption and obtain the opto - mechanical coupling through the off - resonant , dispersive interaction with ions with transition frequencies outside the hole . as a concrete application </S>",

    "<S> the colors on the cantilever indicate different values of the strain : green corresponds to a non - strained material , blue and red to compressive and tensile strain , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the bottom graphs illustrate how a single emission line is shifted due to the strain ( arbitrary units).,width=302 ]    during bending , there will be a strain gradient across the cantilever , ranging from tensile to compressive strain ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ peda_fig ] ) , and ions with identical frequencies in the unbent crystal ( a ) experience different frequency shifts in a bent cantilever ( b ) . in the latter case , ions located in three different layers ( subject to identical strain within each layer ) experience different strain and the emission lines shift accordingly : if the oscillator is bent upwards , emitters on the top face experience a compression , whereas emitters on the bottom face are subject to a tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> as the cantilever vibrates , the collective line shape periodically broadens and narrows , and the motion should be readily detected by an optical probe .    </S>",
    "<S> however , if static local perturbations of the emitters lead to additional inhomogeneous broadening with a very wide absorption line shape , the strain induced frequency shifts can not be probed dispersively . to circumvent this </S>",
    "<S> , we propose to prepare the ion ensemble by burning of narrow spectral holes with the cantilever at rest , and subsequently use their optical response to the cantilever motion . </S>",
    "<S> spectral holes are formed by resonant optical excitation and decay of the ions into other long - lived ( dark ) states , typically other hyperfine state within the electronic ground state manifold . </S>",
    "<S> due to the narrow homogenous linewidths , one can scan the excitation laser over a finite frequency interval and burn a spectral hole which must be narrower than the ground state hyperfine splitting to avoid repopulating the hole by subsequent excitation of the dark ions . </S>",
    "<S> a weak optical field with a frequency at the center of the hole burnt interval will subsequently interact dispersively with the ions with frequencies outside the spectral hole , and we will in the following propose a method to make this dispersive coupling sensitive to the cantilever motion .    as indicated by the example in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ peda_fig ] , bending of the crystal shifts the transition frequency by an amount proportional to the strain experienced by the individual ions . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , to lowest order , the weak probe field is not sensitive to the bending , unless we can ensure an asymmetric response of the ion frequency distribution . </S>",
    "<S> such an asymmetry can be prepared by a particular hole burning protocol as discussed in the following sections .    for our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we assume a spatially homogeneous ion distribution , and we also consider the frequency distribution due to the inhomogeneous broadening to be constant within a wide detuning range . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the bending of the beam shifts the resonance frequency of all ions by a quantity proportional to the strain at their position in the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the bending of the cantilever resonator with thickness @xmath5 and length @xmath6 is represented by a single collective coordinate @xmath7 , measured as the vertical displacement of the cantilever tip shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ peda_fig ] . </S>",
    "<S> the ions are all located near the anchoring of the cantilever with spatial coordinates @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is in the same direction as @xmath7 and runs from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and @xmath4 is along the beam axis , and takes values from @xmath12 to @xmath6 . from the euler - bernouilli theory of beams , we know that the local strain of the matrix around ion @xmath13 is proportional to both @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we optically address only atoms near the base of the cantilever , and we therefore neglect the @xmath4 dependence , so the strain induced frequency shift reads @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a constant depending on the beam geometry and physical properties of the doped material .    </S>",
    "<S> to enhance the position sensitivity of the cantilever , we prepare our system by applying conventional spectral hole burning while the unbent crystalline cantilever is subject to a magnetic gradient . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a convenient choice of light polarization and magnetic field directions with reference to the crystalline axes so that all ions are shifted by the linear zeeman effect such that the overall transition frequency of the @xmath17 ion at position @xmath8 can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the chosen central frequency for our hole burnt structure , @xmath20 is the intrinsic inhomogeneous frequency shift of the @xmath17 ions ( without the effect of cantilever motion or magnetic field ) , @xmath21 is the externally applied magnetic gradient and @xmath22 the linear zeeman effect sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> we finally also assume that @xmath20 and @xmath9 are uncorrelated .    </S>",
    "<S> our functionalized hole burning procedure consists of two steps :    * 1 ) * apply a static magnetic gradient @xmath23 and scan the hole burning laser across the spectral range @xmath24 $ ] within the inhomogeneous linewidth . the value of @xmath25 can be chosen arbitrarily , but must fulfill the condition @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> this step is represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b .    as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , after the magnetic gradient has been switched off , we obtain an inhomogeneous absorption profile of the ions with a transmission hole around the central frequency @xmath19 , and with a width that depends on the location @xmath9 in the cantilever but is on average close to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we are then ready to probe and interact with the system by transmission of a weak laser beam with frequency @xmath19 , at the center of the hole . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c , we show how the frequency shift @xmath15 due to bending of the cantilever transforms the shape of the transmission window . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we note that our hole burning procedure ensures a non - vanishing phase shift of the probe beam due to changes in @xmath7 , because contributions from ions with positive @xmath9 are not canceled by the ions with negative @xmath9 as they are further detuned .    at a finite temperature , corrections to the hole shape </S>",
    "<S> arise because the thermal brownian motion of the cantilever amplitude during hole burning exposes the whole inhomogeneous profile to strain distortions like the one shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c . </S>",
    "<S> these distortions lead to excitation and decay into dark states of those ions that are brought into resonance with the hole burning laser during their random brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the consequences of this mechanism by assuming that ions with frequencies within @xmath30 of the spectral hole in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a are also transferred to dark states , where @xmath31 is of same order of magnitude as the root - mean - square thermal excursions of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",

    "<S> , we use a semi - classical approach based on the maxwell - bloch equations , which , on the one hand , accounts for the state of the individual atoms by solution of the quantum optical master equation and , on the other hand , describe the damping and dispersion of the maxwell electric field amplitude due to the interaction with the mean atomic dipole density . due to the spectral hole , </S>",
    "<S> the laser is far off - resonant from all atomic transitions , and we are in the dispersive and perturbative regime of linear excitation of the atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> the cantilever is a mechanical resonator of eigenfrequency @xmath35 , for which we assume a small modulation amplitude . under this assumption , and imposing the extra condition that @xmath36 for adiabatic following ( see appendix ) , the phase shift of the probe field with wavelength @xmath37 and cross section @xmath38 interacting with a two - level system with detuning @xmath39 and radiative decay rate @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 per atom .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase change @xmath42 of the classical ( coherent state ) field amplitude is equivalent to a phase change of the same value occurring on each single photon due to the presence of the ion . </S>",
    "<S> the combined state of the ion and the stream of photons thus accumulates a quantum phase @xmath43 that changes at a rate @xmath44 , where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the rate of photons passing through @xmath38 with intensity @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the ion is left in its ground state and the photons leave with unchanged frequency , and the time evolving phase due to the light - matter interaction is equivalent to the light induced ac stark shift of the ion due to the laserfield , @xmath48 where @xmath49 . the expression for @xmath50 has , indeed , the familiar form @xmath51 , valid for large detunings . </S>",
    "<S> we note that we applied a simple two - level description and to evaluate the accurate value of the optical phase shift and atomic energy shift , one must specify the actual transition , the light polarization , and also the index of refraction of the host material .    </S>",
    "<S> since the ion transition frequencies are modified by the crystal strain , their ac stark shifts become functions of @xmath7 as well as a of the optical intensity , i.e. , we obtain the desired optomechanical coupling . the total energy shift of all ions - due to the dispersive light matter interaction , is the sum of eq.([phaseshift ] ) over all ions .     </S>",

    "<S> conversely , the coupling between the light field and the emitters produces a phase shift on the laser . </S>",
    "<S> the same proportionality applies between the optical phasehift and interaction energy for the whole system as for a single ion , and we can thus directly write the phase shift of the optical beam as @xmath67 where the dependence on the intensity @xmath47 cancels due to the explicit proportionality between @xmath60 and @xmath47 in the dispersive coupling regime .    </S>",
    "<S> this phase - shift can be detected interferometrically , which provides a readout of the position of the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the light intensity that leads to the displacement expressed in eq . [ staticdisplacement ] , the corresponding phase shift of the carrier optical frequency is @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> the vibratory movements , on the other hand , can be detected on the transmitted laser field by observing spectral sidebands at the mechanical oscillator frequency @xmath69 from the carrier . </S>",
    "<S> thermal excitation of the cantilever motion yields a total integrated power of sideband phase fluctuations equal to @xmath70 , which converges to the value @xmath71 at zero temperature . to detect such sidebands </S>",
    "<S> requires their amplitude to exceed the shot noise limit for the given optical power and integration time ( measurement bandwidth ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of the phase fluctuation is thus ultimately limited by photon absorption and transfer of ions to other long lived states , which gradually `` overburns '' the spectral hole and destroys it . the transition line in eu : yso , however , has a very small natural linewidth @xmath40 and therefore , even for high optical power , overburning will not occur before a typical time @xmath72 , which sets the limit for the integration time . </S>",
    "<S> increasing optical power within the integration time @xmath73 can lead to arbitrarily high resolution , although of course practical consideration ( heat dissipation , etc ... ) limits the maximum power to a few mw . </S>",
    "<S> further improvement of the resolution can be obtained by repeating the experiment ( erasing , re - imprinting and probing the spectral hole ) and averaging the successive results .    as an example we consider a single - clamped cantilever with the dimensions @xmath74 interacting with a laser beam traversing the cantilever near its fixed end for maximum strain as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ holes ] . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a cantilever which consists of @xmath1 ( young modulus of 135 gp ) with an effective mass @xmath75 kg , and of which the first excited mechanical mode vibrates at @xmath35= 890 khz . </S>",
    "<S> the cantilever contains a 0.1 % doping of @xmath0 ions , with a @xmath2 @xmath3 transition centered at 580 nm and with @xmath76 hz ( and @xmath77 typically @xmath78 khz ) at t=3 k. we choose a power of 1 mw and a hole width of @xmath29=6 mhz to fulfill the condition for large detuned adiabatic following , see appendix . to calculate the proportionality constant @xmath16 we use the values from @xcite -211.4 hz / pa for crystal site 1 , which is the most sensitive of the two non - equivalent sites  . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity to magnetic field is @xmath79 khz / g  @xcite . in order to maximize the coupling while fulfilling the condition @xmath80 we choose @xmath81 t / m , which seems possible to achieve in a cryogenic environment over short distances ( mm or less ) using small superconducting coils .    in this configuration , the static displacement of the tip of the resonator due to the light field amounts to @xmath64=0.4 pm and </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding phase shift of the laser ( the carrier ) equals 0.2 mrad . </S>",
    "<S> this shift is easily observable as , for the 1 mw laser power , the shot noise limited phase resolution is 0.45 @xmath82rad within the allowed detection time , before hole - overburning becomes non - negligible ( approximately 16 ms for the 122 hz linewidth ) . </S>",
    "<S> each of the spectral sidebands due to brownian motion at 3 k contains an integrated phase of 0.11 mrad , while the phase resolution for an integration time equal to the inverse of the thermal linewidth ( 25 @xmath82s ) is 14 @xmath82rad , hence the sidebands are readily observed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by increasing the integration time , it is possible to observe the detailed shape of the brownian motion induced sidebands . </S>",
    "<S> the sidebands due to zero point fluctuations contain a total integrated phase of 0.4 @xmath82rad , a value close to the phase resolution corresponding to the maximum integration time before hole - overburning . </S>",
    "<S> the shot noise limited resolution is therefore sufficient to observe the effect of the quantization of the mechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> note that the resolution can be further increased by repeating the full hole imprinting and measurement sequence several times , or use optical repumpers to preserve the spectral hole .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the zero point fluctuations can be observed by measuring the total integrated phase fluctuations in the sidebands and/or their amplitude and linewidth at a given temperature . at the shot - noise limited highest resolution achievable , </S>",
    "<S> the few percent deviation from the purely brownian - motion induced sidebands due to zero - point fluctuations can be observed even at 3 k temperature . </S>",
    "<S> several measurements at various temperatures may also be used to estimate the various necessary parameters ( exact temperature of the resonator , q factor , ... ) within a few percent accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we emphasize that even though , for technical simplicity , we evaluated the different parameters at 3k , a dilution fridge with temperature around 0.1k or lower can also be used , reducing the thermal fluctuations in order to make quantum features even more easily discernible .    </S>",
    "<S> a last potentially perturbing effect arises due to fluctuations of the laser power . </S>",
    "<S> as the static displacement corresponding to 1mw of laser power is approximately 0.4 pm , this laser power must be stable to within @xmath83 10@xmath84 to ensure a perturbation much smaller than the zero point fluctuations ( @xmath83 1 fm ) , a power stability requirement well within reach of standard stabilization techniques .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a hybrid scheme which provides an efficient optomechanical strain based coupling between a mechanical resonator and an ensemble of narrow linewidth ions . the coupling mechanism via a functionalized spectrally burnt hole does not suffer from inhomogeneous broadening of the emitters , nor from the inhomogeneity of the strain across the resonator during displacement . </S>",
    "<S> it is even possible to further increase the coupling by exploiting not just one but an ensemble of functionalized spectral holes within the inhomogeneous linewidth , which can be obtained by using a comb of optical frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow linewidth and dispersive nature of the coupling allows use of a relatively large optical power without destruction of the functionalized hole and observation of the cantilever motion at the quantum level .    </S>",
