    "ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity are two of the most well - known and technologically relevant types of long range ordering that can occur in solids .",
    "it is therefore of paramount interest and importance that in a class of ternary oxides , known as multiferroics , both types of order seem to coexist with the possibility of interplay between long range magnetism and long range electric polarization @xcite .",
    "the recently discovered new class of multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric effects often display the coexistence of a spatially modulated magnetic order , called ` cycloidal ' order , and uniform polarization ( @xmath2 ) , which is induced by the broken inversion symmetry due to the modulation of the magnetization @xcite . since @xmath2 is inherently of magnetic origin , unusual magnetoelectric effects , as displayed by the ability to tune the polarization by a magnetic field which acts on the cycloidal order parameter , are possible , opening up many applications mostovoy1,tokura2,cheong2,chapon , goto , kenze , pimenov , sneff , tokura3,tokura . among this exciting class of materials ,",
    "the cubic spinel oxide cocr@xmath3o@xmath4 is even more unusual , since it displays not only a non - zero @xmath5 and a spatially _ modulated _ magnetic order , but also a _ uniform _",
    "magnetization @xcite ( @xmath6 ) in a so - called ` conical cycloid ' state ( see below )",
    ". the uniform component of @xmath6 provides an extra handle @xcite with which to tune @xmath2 , as has been recently demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the low value of the required tuning magnetic field @xmath7 t , makes this material even more experimentally appealing .",
    "the ability to tune @xmath2 by tuning the uniform part of @xmath6 poses a theoretical puzzle , since , in existing theories , the uniform piece of @xmath6 should not influence the polarization at all @xcite .",
    "this has lead to the introduction of the ` toroidal moment ' , @xmath8 , as the real order parameter characterizing the conical cycloid state of cocr@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we explain this unique phenomenon and the other interesting aspects of the physics of the conical cycloid state by developing a phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory .",
    "additionally , the rotationally invariant form of the theory proves that both the ordinary and the conical cycloidal orders , with the resulting multiferroicity , are possible even in systems _ without _ easy plane spin and easy axis lattice anisotropies .",
    "this is important since earlier models mostovoy1 , mostovoy2 , katsura2 of the cycloidal state depend crucially on such anisotropies .",
    "however , such anisotropic models can _ not _ explain the presence of the cycloidal state in cubic systems like cocr@xmath3o@xmath4 , where such phases are also observed despite the fact that their cubic symmetry forbids such easy plane and easy axis anisotropies .",
    "cocr@xmath3o@xmath4 , with the lattice structure of a cubic spinel , enters into a state with a uniform magnetization at a temperature @xmath9 k. microscopically , the magnetization is of ferrimagnetic origin @xcite , and in what follows we will only consider the ferromagnetic component , @xmath6 , of the magnetization of a ferrimagnet . at a lower critical temperature , @xmath10 k , the system develops a special helical modulation of the magnetization in a plane transverse to the large uniform component .",
    "such a state can be described by an order parameter , @xmath11where @xmath12 form an orthonormal triad and @xmath13 denotes higher harmonics  such as terms proportional to sines and cosines of @xmath14 with integer @xmath15 . when the pitch vector , @xmath16 , is normal to the plane of the rotating components , the rotating components form a conventional helix @xcite .",
    "for @xmath17 such a state , which we call an ` ordinary helix ' state , is observed in many rare - earth metals @xcite , e.g. mnsi ishikawa , pfleiderer , and fege @xcite .",
    "we call a helix state with @xmath18 , which is observed in some heavy rare - earth metals cooper , a ` conical helix ' state because the tip of the magnetization falls on the edge of a cone .",
    "a more complicated modulation arises when @xmath16 lies _ in the plane _ of the rotating components . for @xmath17",
    ", we call such a state an ` ordinary cycloid ' state because the profile of the magnetization resembles the shape of a cycloid",
    ". the state with @xmath18 is called a ` conical cycloid ' state .",
    "it is easy to see that the helical , but not the cycloidal , modulation preserves a residual symmetry under translations and suitable simultaneous rotations about the pitch vector . since @xmath6 and @xmath2 respectively break time reversal and spatial inversion symmetry , the leading @xmath2-dependent piece in a gl hamiltonian density , @xmath19 , for a centrosymmetric , time reversal invariant system with cubic symmetry is @xcite,@xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are coupling constants .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 is a slave of @xmath6 , in the sense that a non - zero @xmath2 only occurs due to the spontaneous development of a magnetic state with a non - zero @xmath23 * * , * * which then , through the linear coupling to @xmath2 in ( [ h - p ] ) , induces a non - zero @xmath2 .",
    "for an order parameter ansatz given by eq .",
    "[ order - parameter-1 ] , the macroscopic polarization , @xmath24 , is given by minimizing the hamiltonian density ( [ h - p ] ) over @xmath2 , @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "so @xmath24 is normal to both @xmath16 and the axis of rotation , @xmath26 .",
    "note that in a conventional spin density wave state ( @xmath27 ) , as in the helix states , @xmath24 is zero .",
    "however , for a cycloid state , @xmath28 , so there is a non - zero @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is entirely due to the cycloidal components @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and is independent of the uniform magnetization @xmath31 .",
    "thus , while it is conceivable that magnetic fields strong enough to ` flop ' the spins and the axis of rotation of the cycloidal components will alter @xmath32 @xcite , no explanation of how tuning the uniform component of @xmath6 can affect the induced polarization has been offered .",
    "we will do so later in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii lays out the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian and the parameter regions which exhibits the cycloidal phase .",
    "section iii and v are devoted to the phase diagrams of ordinary cycloidal state and conical cycloidal state respectively . in section",
    "v , we explain why the reversal of the direction of the uniform magnetization in the conical cycloidal state can lead to the reversal of electric polarization . section vi consists of conclusions .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian that is _ completely _ invariant under simultaneous rotations of positions and magnetization .",
    "this guarantees that any phase that can occur in our model is _ necessarily _ allowed in a crystal of _ any _ symmetry .",
    "the full hamiltonian is given by , @xmath33 .",
    "using @xmath34 to eliminate @xmath2 , we can write the total hamiltonian density @xmath35 entirely in terms of @xmath6 , @xmath36where we have @xmath37 , @xmath38 for stability . in eq .",
    "[ h - m ] , where the landau expansion of the free energy is truncated at the fourth order , the usual gradient - squared term , @xmath39 , is omitted since , @xmath40 , plus an unimportant surface term which can be neglected .",
    "notice that , for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath35 is rotationally invariant in the spin space alone , so the @xmath43 s themselves are not proportional to the spin - orbit coupling constant ( for e.g. , via the above identity , @xmath44 )",
    ". however , the _ difference _ among the @xmath43 s should be small due to the smallness of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the effects of the competing magnetic interactions , which are present in the multiferroics and are responsible for the spatial modulation of @xmath6 @xcite , are embodied in @xmath45 , which can be negative leading to a spatially modulated order parameter .",
    "for decoupled spin and coordinate spaces ( @xmath43 s equal ) , the energies of the helical and the cycloidal modulations of the spins are identical . in a system where the spin anisotropy constrains the spins to lie on a plane , and the lattice anisotropy forces @xmath16 to be also on that plane",
    ", the energy of the cycloidal modulation can be lower than that of the helical modulation mostovoy2 , katsura2 .",
    "such anisotropies have been implicitly taken as the driving force behind the cycloidal order by mostovoy @xcite , and katsura _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . for cubic crystals ,",
    "however , no such anisotropy exists among the principal directions .",
    "we argue below that , in this case , the magnetoelectric couplings themselves , leading to the difference among the @xmath43 s , can lower the energy of the cycloidal state than that of any other state with an arbitrary angle between @xmath16 and the plane of the magnetization . rather than exploring the complete parameter space of this model , we limit ourselves to two different parameter regions , which exhibit all the phases described above :    * region i * : @xmath46 small , @xmath47 , and    * region ii * : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we have checked that our results are robust against allowing small non - zero values of the various @xmath43 s that we take to be zero . in that sense our results , in particular the topology of the phase diagrams shown in figs .",
    "figure - phase - diagram1a and [ figure - phase - diagram2]a for regions i and ii , respectively , and the orders of the various phase transitions that we predict , are generic . as usual",
    ", our theoretical phase diagrams can be related to experimental ones by noting that _ all _ of the phenomenological parameters @xmath52 in our model should depend on experimental parameters like , e.g. , temperature ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , an experiment in which , e.g. , @xmath53 is varied with all other parameters held fixed will map out a locus of points through our theoretical phase diagrams . in landau theories",
    ", @xmath54 is expected to vary from large positive values , corresponding to disordered phases with @xmath55 , at high @xmath53 , to smaller values at which @xmath56 become possible . in order to access the conical cycloid state ,",
    "we must also allow @xmath57 and @xmath58 to change sign as @xmath53 is decreased .    for the most part we will work in mean field theory , which is simply finding a magnetization configuration @xmath59 that minimizes the hamiltonian ( [ h - m ] ) .",
    "clearly , the task of finding the _ global _ minimum is a formidable one .",
    "instead , we restrict ourselves to ansatzes of the form : @xmath60where the spatially constant vector @xmath61 is allowed to point in _ any _ direction .",
    "( given the global rotation invariance under simultaneous rotations of magnetization and space , an infinity of other solutions trivially related to ( [ order - parameter - ansatz ] ) by such rotations , and with exactly the same energy , also exist , of course . ) in the special case of @xmath16 along @xmath62 direction ( or , equivalently , anywhere in the @xmath63-plane ) , this is a cycloid state with a uniform background magnetization @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath16 is along @xmath65 direction , it is a helix state . inserting this ansatz ( [ order - parameter - ansatz ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ h - m ] ) , and integrating over the volume @xmath66 of the system ,",
    "we can obtain the energy of the system . through the minimization of the energy , we find",
    "the conical cycloid state is the _ only _ state with a non - zero @xmath61 when @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , the optimal direction for @xmath16 is _ always _ either in the ( @xmath63 ) plane , or orthogonal to it .",
    "putting these facts together means that _ all _ of the minimum energy configurations are of the form ( [ order - parameter-1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath16 lies in the ( @xmath63 ) plane , we can always use the global rotation invariance of our model to rotate @xmath16 to lie along the @xmath62-axis , and will henceforth do so .",
    "in * region i * , the dominant terms in the hamiltonian involving the uniform component @xmath31 are @xmath68 , therefore the lowest energy states have @xmath17 .",
    "small negative @xmath69 clearly can not change this fact .",
    "the energy for the ordinary cycloid ( oc ) state is obtained by inserting ( [ order - parameter-1 ] ) with @xmath17 into the hamiltonian @xmath70where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . in writing this , we have neglected the higher harmonics in eq .",
    "( [ order - parameter-1 ] ) , whose amplitude vanishes much faster ( specifically , as fast or faster than @xmath74 ) than the magnitude of the order parameter itself , and thus have negligible effects on the phase boundaries . for large positive @xmath54 ,",
    "all the terms in this energy are positive , and , hence , the lowest energy state is @xmath75 ; i.e. , the paramagnet . as @xmath53 decreases , @xmath54 becomes smaller and the first phase transition that will occur depends on whether the minimum over @xmath76 of @xmath77 or @xmath78 becomes negative first . for @xmath79 , @xmath80 becomes negative first at @xmath81 , and @xmath29 starts to be nonzero .",
    "this boundary between paramagnet and the ordinary longitudinal spin density wave ( ols ) phase ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) is the horizontal ( solid blue ) line in the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ figure - phase - diagram1]a in the ( @xmath84 ) plane for fixed negative @xmath85 and all @xmath86 .    .",
    "( b ) the sequence of phases with decreasing @xmath53 along the locus shown . ]",
    "the ols phase will , as we continue lowering @xmath54 , eventually become unstable to a non - zero @xmath30 ; this is the oc state . by minimizing the energy ( eoc ) in the ols phase , we find @xmath88 and @xmath89 . inserting these into ( [ eoc ] )",
    "we find that the coefficient of @xmath90 becomes negative below @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "this value @xmath92 of @xmath54 therefore defines the locus of a continuous ols - oc phase transition , and is the non - horizontal straight ( solid ( blue ) ) line in the @xmath93 plane shown in fig .",

    "however , it is not true because the ots phase always has higher energy than the ordinary helical ( oh ) phase .",
    "the energy for the ordinary helix state is@xmath99the minimization of the energy over the direction of @xmath100 vector yields @xmath101 , that is , a _ circular _ helix .",
    "further minimization over @xmath102 and @xmath76 gives the energy @xmath103 of the ordinary helix state @xmath104for @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",

    "@xmath110 is clearly higher than @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the helical state is always favored over the ots state throughout region i of the phase diagram . note that @xmath111 defines the boundary for the second order transition from the paramagnet to the oh state .",
    "there is also a direct first order phase transition between the oh and the ols states along the line where @xmath112 . here",
    "@xmath113 is the energy for ols state obtained from equation ( [ eoc ] ) .",
    "this equality yields the first order phase boundary @xmath114 between the oh and the ols states ( the dotted ( green ) line ) .",
    "the line for the ols - oc transition always intersects the first order ols - oh phase boundary before crossing the paramagnet - ols boundary .",
    "this therefore always yields the topology shown in fig .",

    "on the other hand , a direct transition to the circular helix state is predicted by our theory , and has indeed been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "all of the above statements are based on mean field theory , that is theory without considering the fluctuations .",
    "going beyond mean field theory , very general arguments due to brazovskii @xcite imply that , in rotation invariant models , _ any _ direct transition from a homogeneous state ( paramagnet ) to a translationally ordered one ( ols and oh ) _ must _ be driven first order by fluctuations .",
    "consideration of topological defects and orientational order @xcite supports this conclusion , but raises the additional possibility that direct transition between the homogeneous and the translationally ordered phases could split into two , with an intermediate orientationally ordered phase , analogous to the 2d hexatic  phase @xcite . in the present context , this implies that both the paramagnet to ols and oh phase transitions are either driven first order by fluctuations , or split into two transitions with an intermediate orientationally ordered phase .",
    "crystal symmetry breaking fields neglected in our model could invalidate this conclusion , if strong enough .",
    "in * region ii * , we can show that conical cycloid ( cc ) state of the form @xmath116 is the lowest energy state among all the possible states with arbitrary mutual angles between the uniform magnetization , @xmath16 , and the cycloid plane .",

    "however , we have verified that amplitudes of the _ h.h .",
    "_ terms are only a very small fraction of the cycloidal components @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( not of the uniform component @xmath31 ) , therefore their neglect below ( but close to ) the lower cycloidal transition temperature of 26 k is justified .",

    ", we can minimize eq .",
    "( [ ecc ] ) over @xmath31 with @xmath122 , and find a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state with @xmath123 . for large positive @xmath85 and @xmath124 , this ferromagnetic state is clearly stable against the development of non - zero @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it also clearly becomes _ unstable _ against the development of a non - zero @xmath29 if @xmath85 is lowered to negative values , because then the coefficient @xmath125 of @xmath126 becomes negative for sufficiently small @xmath76 .",
    "this instability ( which is clearly into the cls state ) will occur at @xmath127 , at a wavevector @xmath76 satisfying @xmath128 .",

    "the order parameter @xmath129 _ also _ vanishes as this transition is approached .",
    "thus , this transition is , like the @xmath130 - incommensurate transition in quartz and berlinite @xcite , simultaneously a _ nucleation _ transition ( @xmath76 vanishes ) , and an _ instability _ transition ( order parameter vanishes ) .",
    "indeed , this transition and the fm@xmath131 cts transition , which is of the same type and will be discussed below , are , to our knowledge , the _ first _ examples of transitions that exhibit such a dual character in a model _ without _ terms linear in the gradient operator .    .",
    "the ( green ) arrow represents a direct first order transition between the fm and the cc state . ]",
    "we can find the loci of instability between the cls phase and the cc state by calculating the coefficient of @xmath90 in ( [ ecc ] ) in the cls phase , and finding where it becomes negative .",
    "the minimization of the energy ( [ ecc ] ) over @xmath76 , @xmath31 and @xmath29 yields @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath129 . inserting these expressions into ( [ ecc ] ) and taking the coefficient of @xmath90 to be zero",
    ", we find the cls to cc phase boundary as:@xmath134    similar analysis of the sequence of the phase transition , fm @xmath131 cts @xmath131 cc , yields the schematic phase diagram on the @xmath135 plane given in fig .",
    "[ figure - phase - diagram2]a .",
    "the phase boundary between fm and cts is given by @xmath136 .",
    "the phase boundary between the cts and the cc phase at small @xmath85 is @xmath137 , which is also shown in fig .",

    "[ figure - phase - diagram2 ] shows that it is not possible to go from the fm to the cc state via a continuous transition , except at a single special point .",
    "generic paths like the diagonal dashed lines in fig .",
    "figure - phase - diagram2a _ must _ go through either the cls or the cts state , so two transitions are required to reach the cc state , which , additionally , must be elliptical .",
    "hence the only way there can be a direct transition from the fm state to the cc state is via a first order phase transition , which is not addressed by our theory .",
    "this prediction is borne out by experiments of cocr@xmath3o@xmath4 , where the direct fm to cc transition is indeed first order @xcite .",
    "the polarization @xmath138 in the cc state is in the @xmath139 plane , normal to @xmath26 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is independent of the uniform magnetization , @xmath31 .",

    "it is found , at first , that @xmath145 is uniquely determined by @xmath146 alone , independent of the _ initial _ direction of @xmath147 , as expected .",
    "however , once @xmath145 and @xmath31 have set in , changing @xmath148 to @xmath149 not only reverses the direction of @xmath31 , but also , quite unexpectedly , reverses the direction of @xmath145 as well . in the literature @xcite , this has lead to the definition of the ` toroidal moment ' , @xmath8 , as the order parameter .",
    "it is clear that the experimental system is in the conical cycloid state , where @xmath150 and @xmath145 are always in mutually orthogonal directions @xcite .",
    "further , as expected for this state , the directions of @xmath31 and @xmath145 are uniquely determined by the small cooling fields , @xmath147 and @xmath146 , respectively , which add terms to the hamiltonian that split the degeneracy between the minima corresponding to the different directions .",
    "now assume that the direction of @xmath147 is reversed , @xmath151 , reversing the direction of @xmath31 once it has well developed .",
    "there are two ways the uniform magnetization can reverse its direction .",
    "first , @xmath31 may continue to remain along the @xmath65-axis and its magnitude may pass through zero to become @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",

    "however , since @xmath31 is already well developed and large ( @xmath9 k ) , due to the magnetic exchange energy cost it may be energetically more favorable to leave the magnitude of @xmath31 unchanged , and its direction may _ rotate in space _ to @xmath155 .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath31 must rotate staying on the @xmath156 plane , since that way it always remains perpendicular to @xmath16 , whose direction fluctuations cost the crystalline anisotropy energy .",
    "it is then clear , see fig .",
    "figure - rotation , that the cycloid plane itself , which is always perpendicular to @xmath31 to maintain the lowest energy configuration , must rotate about @xmath143 by a total angle @xmath157 .",
    "it follows that @xmath145 , always on the cycloid plane , reverses its direction to @xmath158 . this way ,",
    "even though there is no dynamical coupling between @xmath31 and @xmath145 , the latter can also _ rotate _ by an angle @xmath157 as a result of the former reversing its direction in space .",

    "@xmath145 points in the @xmath155 direction . ]",
    "to conclude , we ve shown that the magnetic cycloidal orders , and the resulting multiferroicity , can naturally arise due to the magnetoelectric couplings even in rotationally invariant systems , or in cubic crystals .",
    "this explains such orders in cocr@xmath3o@xmath4 , which lack easy plane anisotropies , and are hence outside the realm of the previous theoretical studies on multiferroics .",
