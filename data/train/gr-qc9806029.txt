    "moreover , in radiating fluids when the medium is very transparent and photons escape efficiently , occupation numbers of atomic levels are , in general , no longer predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics for local values of the temperature and density . in this case , the local state of a fluids is coupled by photon exchange to the state of the material within an entire interaction volume .",
