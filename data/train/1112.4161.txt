    "the physics of dilute ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices has grown to one of the most fascinating fields over the last decade @xcite . in the case of bosons ,",
    "the delicate balance between the atom - atom on - site interaction and the hopping amplitude leads to a quantum phase transition @xcite between two distinct phases @xcite . when the on - site interaction is small compared to the hopping amplitude , the ground state is superfluid , as the bosons are phase coherent and delocalized . in the opposite limit of the strong on - site repulsion ,",
    "the ground state is a mott - insulator , as every boson is trapped in one of the potential minima .",
    "meanwhile , this clean defectless setup , which allows for precise control of its paramters , has opened up testing ground for quantum many - body physics , i.e. the so - called quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "while most experiments with ultracold atoms up to date have been performed in simple cubic lattices due to the ease of their experimental implementation @xcite , recent work have explored ultra - cold atoms in non - standard optical lattices such as triangular@xcite and hexagonal optical lattices @xcite , even the kagom optical lattices has also been recognized couple of months ago @xcite .",
    "in fact , due to the complex of the lattice structure in these systems , novel and rich new phases will be exhibited .",
    "hence , to determine the quantum phase diagrams analytically in these systems becomed a major problem and need to be investigated systematically .    actually , there are two main analytical methods which can be used to determine the phase boundaries of bose gases .",
    "one is the mean - field theory @xcite , the other one is the so - called strong - coupling expansion @xcite .",
    "however , comparison with the monte carlo data @xcite shows that the mean - field theory underestimates the location of the phase boundary while the strong - coupling expansion goes in the opposite direction .",
    "more recently , an alternative analytical treatment based on the effective potential and rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory has been presented @xcite , this novel method may , in principle , yields analytical results for phase boundaries at arbitrary dimension and lobe number in arbitrarily high order accuracy .    in this paper , with the help of this novel systematic approach , we are going to determine the mott - insulator - superfluid ( mi - sf ) quantum phase boundaries of ultracold scalar bose systems in triangular lattice , hexagonal lattice and kagom lattice analytically , and present the corresponding expressions of the phase boundaries . comparing to numerical solutions ,",
    "the relative deviation of our third - order analytical results is less than 10% .",
    "a system of spinless bosons trapped in a homogeneous optical lattice can be described by the simple yet nontrivial bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite which reads @xmath0 with @xmath1 being nearest neighbor hopping parameter while @xmath2 denoting the strength of on - site repulsion between two atoms , @xmath3 are the corresponding particle number operator .",
    "@xmath4 is the chemical potential .",
    "when the depth of the optical lattice wells is increased , the hopping parameter @xmath1 decreases exponentially while @xmath2 increases linearly @xcite .    in order to investigate the superfluid - mott insulator phase transition systematically and to determine the corresponding phase boundary analytically in a more accurate way",
    ", we are going to tackle this issue via field theory , or namely , the effective potential method @xcite . to this end",
    ", we add for the moment additional source terms with strength @xmath5 and @xmath6 into the bose - hubbard hamiltonian as following @xmath7 and treat the hopping term and external source terms as perturbations . here",
    "@xmath8 is the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is quite straightforward that the grand - canonical free energy can be presented as power series of both the hopping parameter @xmath1 and the source @xmath9 via taylor s expansions .",
    "since the unperturbed ground states are mott states with the same occupation number on each site , i.e. the unperturbed state is local , @xmath5 and @xmath10 can only appear in pair in the expansion .",
    "after regrouping the terms in the free energy with respect of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the free energy reads @xmath11 with the expansion coefficients @xmath12 being power series of hopping parameter @xmath1 , @xmath13 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "the superfluid order parameter @xmath14 and its complex conjugate can then be calculated by @xcite @xmath15    with the help of the above formula , a legendre transformation of the grand - canonical free energy can thus be conducted , leading to the effective potential as follows : @xmath16 substituting eq.([free - energy ] ) into eq.([psi - definition - j ] ) , the relation between the order parameter and the external source strength is obtained and can then be used to eliminate @xmath5 and @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ effective - potential - definition ] ) , giving @xmath17    apparently the effective potential takes exactly the form of @xmath18 theory . indeed , from eq.([effective - potential - definition ] ) , it is immediately recognized that the external sources can be expressed as @xmath19 recalling that the original physical system what we are interested in is a system with vanishing external sources , this equation shows that the physical states correspond to the saddle points of the effective potential .",
    "as is known , in @xmath18 theory the phase transitions is marked by the sign change of the coefficient of the quadratic term , indicating that for our system the phase boundary can be found by letting @xmath20 , the solution of this equation will provide us the critical value of @xmath1 .    actually , as shown in eq.([expansion - coefficient - c2p ] ) , @xmath21 is a power series of @xmath1 , thus the radius of convergence of @xmath21 will reveal the location of the phase boundary .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath22-th order approximation of the phase boundary is given by @xmath23 this equation shows that , in principle , the phase boundary of the bose - hubbard system can be calculated out analytically with arbitrarily high accuracy via the field theory method or effective potential method .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the pioneer work @xcite in this field , the expression of the phase boundary is different from what we got above .",
    "the reason is that in that work , @xmath24 was inconveniently expanded to a power series of @xmath1 .",
    "however , this inconvenience would not affect the credit of that elegant work .",
    "from the above discussion , we have translated the problem of finding the phase boundary to the problem of calculating the coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "these quantities can be calculated via linked cluster expansion @xcite and rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory , or namely the kato s formulation @xcite .",
    "since the unperturbed state corresponding to the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath26 is mott state with all lattice sites occupied by the same number of bosons , thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian - with - source ] ) , in the free energy @xmath27 ( [ free - energy ] ) , between the bra and ket of the unperturbed ground state , every non - zero contribution to @xmath28 includes exactly one creation operator at @xmath29-th site ( associated with @xmath30 ) and one annihilation operator at @xmath31-th site ( associated with @xmath32 ) as well as @xmath22 nearest neighboring hopping processes ( associated with @xmath1 ) connecting @xmath29 and @xmath31 sites via other neighboring lattice sites .",
