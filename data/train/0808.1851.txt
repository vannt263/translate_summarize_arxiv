    "one of the most famous _ inverse problems _ in mathematical physics is the question whether one can hear the shape of a drum , which was posed by _",
    "kac _ in 1966 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the laplace operator @xmath0 on a riemannian manifold @xmath1 , representing the drum , corresponds to the frequencies of the eigenmodes in which this manifold is vibrating . since 1964",
    "it is known that the answer to this question is negative , when _ milnor",
    "_ @xcite found a pair of isospectral , non - isometric flat tori in 16 dimensions .",
    "many examples of such pairs are known today . for an overview on different aspects of the theory of isospectral manifolds the works of _ sunada _ , _ gordon _ , _ webb _ , _ wolpert _ and _ brooks _ should be mentioned @xcite .",
    "recent results and examples of isospectral manifolds are presented in @xcite .",
    "forty years after the foundation of the area of _ isospectrality _ another invariant object of the manifold @xmath1 , connected to its vibration modes , has joined the field of interest @xcite : the eigenfunctions corresponding to a specific eigenvalue @xmath2 form an _ eigenspace _ @xmath3 , due to the equation @xmath4 . for every element of the eigenspace @xmath5 its _ nodal domains _ are defined as the connected components of the set @xmath6 .",
    "the set @xmath7 is called the _ nodal set of @xmath8_. a visualization of the nodal set is given by the _ chladni figures _ , that arise as those patterns formed by sand poured on a vibrating membrane @xcite . assigning to each eigenvalue @xmath2 the set of _ nodal counts _ @xmath9 , the numbers of nodal domains @xmath10 , that are obtained by elements of its eigenspace @xmath11 and ordering these sets according to the position of @xmath2 within the spectrum , we obtain a sequence @xmath12 called the _",
    "nodal sequence_. + due to the existence of isospectral manifolds , it is known that the information stored in the spectrum of a riemannian manifold does not suffice to determine the manifold itself .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate whether the nodal sequence reveals similar or complementary information about the underlying geometry .",
    "this idea is due to _ smilansky _ ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent progress shows , that this approach is very promising . for different objects like graphs , billiards , tori and surfaces of revolution ,",
    "nodal sequences have been investigated and in each case they reveal information about the underlying objects .",
    "it was possible to distinguish between integrable and chaotic billiards by using the nodal sequence @xcite .",
    "examples of isospectral manifolds and graphs have been distinguished by using their nodal sequences @xcite , which leads to the assumption that the nodal sequence contains complementary information about the geometry to the spectrum .",
    "it was even possible to find a trace formula for the nodal counting function of different manifolds @xcite , which shows a deep similarity to the ideas that once led to the original isospectrality problem .",
    "+ we want to focus now on a specific part of the investigation of spectra of manifolds . changing the isospectrality problem slightly by restricting it to a class of manifolds leads to a new question . are there classes within which it is possible to hear the shape of a drum ?",
    "the answer is positive , and examples for such classes are low - dimensional flat tori or surfaces of revolution @xcite .",
    "this problem can be translated to the study of nodal sequences , which we call the _ inverse nodal problem_. it was solved recently by _",

    "small nodal counts these positions might be incorrect , but as we construct a sequence for @xmath193 and the identification is asymptotically valid , this finite set of incorrect values does not affect the limit .",
    "the limit is now constructed in the same way as in the rectangle case ( cf . page ) .",
    "+ we now study the case @xmath160 . to know the asymptotic behaviour it is necessary to decide between @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",

    "the positions of the set of eigenvalues @xmath196 are also known .",
    "due to the relation @xmath197 the position of @xmath159 might be bigger , smaller or between the positions of @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
