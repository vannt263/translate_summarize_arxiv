    "although the physical meaning of the seiberg - witten equations ( @xmath4-eq . ) is yet to be discovered , the mathematical meaning is rather deep and highly efficient to understand one of the most basic phenomenon of differential topology in four dimension , namely , the existence of non - equivalent differential smooth structures on the same underlying topological manifold .",

    "the duality is at the quantum level , since one of its necessary condition is the equality of the expectations values for the dual theories . in topology , this means that fixed a 4-manifold its seiberg - witten invariants are equal to donaldson invariants . a good reference for @xmath4-eq .",

    ", we refer to the @xmath4-equation as the euler - lagrange equation of the @xmath4 functional .",
    "these equations are 2@xmath11-order differential equations and from now on they will be called @xmath4-equations .    since the ( ps)-condition is satisfied in the quotient space , the main aim is to describe the weak homotopy type of the moduli space @xmath12 in order to prove the existence of solutions to the @xmath4-equation .",
    "from a duality principle appliable to susy theories in quantum field theory , seiberg - witten , in  @xcite , discovered a nice coupling of the self - dual(_sd _ ) equation , of a @xmath13 yang - mills theory , to the dirac@xmath14 equation . in order to describe this coupling",
