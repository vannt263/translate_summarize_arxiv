    "the high incidence of binaries in loose star forming regions implies that formation in multiple systems is the norm ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . while the multiplicity statistics of dense star - forming regions do not show significant excess over the main - sequence , it is still undetermined whether stars form with different multiplicity statistics in these environments , or whether shorter dynamical times accelerate the disruption of multiple systems @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the details of the binary - star formation process given the significance of binary - star formation both as a substantial contributor to the galactic stellar population and in influencing planet formation and stellar feedback .",

    "the presence of @xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) emission without @xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) emission led @xcite to believe it was arising in a shock .",

    "this was done in order to help characterize instrumental effects on the spectral traces ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an observing log is included in table [ obstable ] .",
    "we slewed off source to collect sky frames once for the pair of pa=@xmath23 observations and once for the pair of pa=@xmath24 observations .",
    "likewise , observations of the a7 star hr 1620 were made once for each position angle to facilitate the correction of telluric absorption features in our data .",
    "flat field frames were collected to correct for inter - pixel variations in the detector gain .    to monitor instrumental flexure and spectral fringing effects , we collected flat field frames at each new pointing during the night .",
    "dark frames to correct the flats were collected at the end of the night .",
    "we developed a dedicated pipeline for the reduction of echelle - mode data from aries to analyze our observations .",
    "we began with subtracting sky frames from science frames , and dark frames from flat frames .",
    "we then dewarped the spectral orders using a fifth - degree two - dimensional polynomial coordinate transformation to map the curved stellar spectral traces to straight lines .",
    "figure [ flatfig ] shows an example of dewarping a flat - field frame using the transformation derived from the stellar traces .",
    "we used a fifth - degree transformation as this was adequate to ensure that the spatial dimension of each order was perpendicular to the spectral dimension , as we verified using observations of an argon arclamp ( figure [ argonfig ] ) .",
    "after dewarping all the frames , we began defringing , beginning with the flats .",
    "the dominant frequency of the instrumental fringing is @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to a fringe wavelength of @xmath26 km / s .",
    "our flat - defringing algorithm proceeded row - by - row in each order as follows .",
    "we first fitted and subtracted a third - order polynomial to the row .",
    "we then created a model of the fringe pattern using a fourier filter which only passed frequencies less than 0.015 @xmath27 ( see figure [ flatdefringe ] ) .",
    "next , we subtracted this model fringe from the row it was created from and then added back in the third - order polynomial that was previously subtracted .",
    "this was done in order to remove the fringing but maintain the very low frequency shape of the flat .",
    "we saved our derived model fringe in a template for later re - use in defringing the stellar spectra .",
    "after defringing the flats , we divided the flat frames into the stellar spectra .",
    "our next step was to extract from the two - dimensional spectral orders one - dimensional spectra . to extract the 1-d spectra",
    "we first fit a gaussian to the average spatial profile of the order .",
    "then , for each column , we summed the light in each row 1-@xmath28 above and below the average spatial centroid .",
    "with the stellar spectra extracted , our next step was to defringe them .",
    "we started with the telluric calibrator . since sharp features",
    "have broad fourier transforms , narrow telluric absorption lines in the telluric calibrator spectrum can bias the instrumental fringe model when using even a low - pass fourier filter . to avoid this , before creating the model fringe , we first interpolated over telluric lines .",
    "we have illustrated this step in the top panel of figure [ hr1620defringe ] .",
    "we created a model fringe by first subtracting a best - fit low - order polynomial and then using a fourier filter to pass only the spatial frequencies less than 0.015 @xmath27 ( see the middle panel of figure [ hr1620defringe ] ) .",
    "finally , we subtracted this model fringe from the original spectrum to remove the instrumental fringing and then added back in the best - fit polynomial . since our calibrator source , hr 1620 , rotates quite quickly ( @xmath29 km / s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our fourier filtering approach had the ancillary effect of removing rotationally broadened photospheric lines .",
    "in the bottom panel of figure [ hr1620defringe ] , we compare to the observed telluric transmission spectrum provided by @xcite .",
    "to facilitate the comparison , we show the spectrum of hr 1620 before we replace the best - fit polynomial shape .",
    "next , we performed a wavelength calibration on both the defringed telluric spectrum and the as - yet uncorrected target spectra .",
    "wavelength calibration was done by fitting a fourth - degree polynomial to transform measured telluric absorption line pixel positions to the wavelengths of each line provided by @xcite .",
    "we then divided the telluric calibrator spectrum into the target spectra to remove telluric absorption features . at this point , we summed the spectra from each pa for each target , creating one higher signal - to - noise spectrum for each source .    to defringe the target spectra , we interpolated over narrow emission lines and photospheric absorption lines before defringing . for broad features , such as the br@xmath1 emission line , we had to take care not to model out real emission while still generating an accurate model for the instrumental fringing . to do this , we first generated a best - guess model fringe .",
    "our best - guess fringe was created in two steps : 1 ) we extracted a one - dimensional flat - field fringe by summing the same rows in the template of saved flat fringes that were summed in the science frame during the extraction of the science spectrum , and 2 ) we fit this one - dimensional flat - field fringe to the target spectrum by adjusting the wavelength solution parameters to produce a closest match .",
    "we show this step in the top panel of figure [ uyaurdefringe ] .",
    "next we replaced spectral regions of known features in our observed spectra , with the corresponding region of our best - guess fringe down weighted by the addition of gaussian noise .",
    "we then used a low - pass fourier filter to generate a model fringe ( middle panel of figure [ uyaurdefringe ] ) .",
    "we repeated this process 1000 times , each time with a new realization of the gaussian noise , to produce 1000 model fringes .",
    "the average of the 1000 model fringes we took as our fiducial fringe for defringing .",
    "the variation in the 1000 fringe models suggested the precision of our model fringe . in the bottom panel of figure [ uyaurdefringe ] , we show a portion of the defringed spectrum of uy  aur  a in the vicinity of br@xmath1 , plotted with a blue swath .",
    "the width of the swath at each wavelength represents the 1-@xmath28 variation in the fringe model at that point .",

    ", we generated and subtracted a new fringe model from the observed spectrum and measured the ew . to illustrate this process we show 10 repetitions in figure [ ewfig ] .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of all 1000 ew measurements is our adopted ew and uncertainty , respectively .",
    "the defringing process appears to introduce @xmath33   of uncertainty into our ew measurements for br@xmath1 .",
    "we do not correct our measured ews for photospheric absorption , in line with previous studies @xcite . given the spectral types of the stars ( m0 and m2 for uy aur a and b , respectively",
    "* ) , even with zero veiling the effect on our measured ews is 10% , within our measurement uncertainty .    for the narrow @xmath0 lines , we did not iterate to produce the fringe model because the @xmath0 lines are narrow compared to the fringing , and can be readily distinguished ( see section [ obssec ] ) . to estimate our precision in the measurement of the ew of these lines , we ascribed to each pixel in the line the same level of noise as measured in the nearby continuum .",
    "we then calculate the ew uncertainty to be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of pixels in the line and @xmath28 is the measured noise level .",
    "all ew measurements are presented in table [ ewtable ] .      to convert our ew measurements to line luminosities we used d=140 pc @xcite , and the k - band photometry of @xcite for uy  aur a. for uy  aur b , which has shown significant nir variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we discuss how variable extinction may effect the relative line luminosities .",
    "all resulting emission line luminosities are reported in table [ ewtable ] .",
    "we converted our measured br@xmath1 line luminosity to accretion luminosity , without correcting for extinction , using the correlation reported by @xcite .",
    "accretion rates were derived from accretion luminosities using equation 11 in @xcite which assumes that accreting material is in free fall from 3r@xmath36 when it hits the stellar surface and that half of the accretion energy is radiated directly , the other half heats the star .",
    "our accretion rate measurements are listed in table [ ewtable ] .    in figure [ mdotsfig ]",
    "we plot the accretion rate versus time for each source in the binary .",
    "the additional br@xmath1 derived accretion rates for uy  aur  a were calculated using the ews from @xcite and @xcite and the continuum flux level observed by @xcite .",
    "the flux level for uy  aur  b is always deduced by comparing to uy  aur  a. since @xcite and @xcite do not report errors for their ew measurements we assign them our measured value of 0.3  .",
    "this is probably conservative since most of our uncertainty comes from defringing .",
    "we use 0.05 magnitudes of uncertainty in the continuum flux level , the value reported in @xcite .",
    "some additional uncertainty in the flux level is accrued by using flux calibration data not collected in parallel with the spectroscopic observations .",
    "for example , young binary stars as a class can vary by @xmath37 magnitudes in the nir ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , since the flux ratio between a and b is measured , any untracked variability in the flux of uy  aur  a will affect both components of the binary similarly , preserving the relative trends .",
    "in addition to br@xmath1 derived accretion rates , we also include measurements using other techniques in figure [ mdotsfig ] .",
    "with triangle and square symbols we show accretion rates derived using both optical veiling measurements @xcite , and pf@xmath38 measurements @xcite , respectively .",
    "the published pf@xmath38-derived accretion rates @xcite appear to be at odds with the long - term trends in accretion rate inferred from br@xmath1 and optical veiling measurements .",
    "a re - analysis of the nirspec data suggests that the components were misidentified , and we correct that here .",
    "however , we caution that the nirspec slit was misaligned with the binary pa during these observations , and this adds systematic uncertainty to the relative accretion luminosities derived from these data .    in figure [ mdotsratiofig ] , we show the accretion rate ratio versus time for all epochs when the accretion rate was measured for both sources .",
    "figure [ mdotsratiofig ] shows that accretion was directed primarily toward the secondary component in the initial epoch , but transitioned to the primary over time .",
    "the timescale of the observed variability is much shorter than the @xmath39 year dynamical timescale of the binary .",

    "we detect the v=1 - 0 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines in both sources . a photospheric absorption line in the spectrum of uy  aur  a complicates our ability to place a strong constraint on the v=2 - 1 s(1 ) line .",

    "this is compatible with the absence of strong v=2 - 1 s(1 ) emission in our spectra . since models of fluorescent diffuse gas",
    "predict that the strength of the v=2 - 1 s(1 ) line should be similar to , even greater than , the v=1 - 0 s(0 ) line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can rule out a large contribution to the @xmath0 line emission from fluorescent diffuse gas .",
    "there are several ways to produce a thermalized spectrum of @xmath0 lines .",
    "mechanisms include shock heating and uv / x - ray irradiation of dense gas .",
    "shock heating , in an inflow or outflow , is expected to produce relatively broad lines ( @xmath67 km / s ) offset from the continuum ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "we detect no astrometric displacement along the slit ( pa=40@xmath69 ) .",
    "our measured astrometric precision along the slit is @xmath70 au . given the observed v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line - to - continuum ratio for uy  aur  a , @xmath71 , we constrain the bulk of the observed @xmath0 flux to be centered within 15 au of the continuum at the 3-@xmath28 level .",
    "furthermore , we see no significant increase in the line - to - continuum ratio of the @xmath0 lines when we extract spectra from the margins of our slit , @xmath72 ( @xmath73 au ) from the continuum centroid . in these off - star extractions",
    "we can constrain any extended emission in the @xmath72 region , along a pa of 40@xmath69 , to be less than @xmath74 ergs @xmath75 s@xmath4 arcsec@xmath76 . since we do not detect any spatial offsets or extension in the @xmath0 lines , it is difficult for us to directly implicate shocks with these data .    assessing whether fuv or x - ray irradiation could be responsible for excititing the @xmath0 lines is difficult because no well characterized fuv spectrum exists for uy  aur . @xcite",
    "used the spectrum of tw  hya to model the @xmath0 ro - vibrational spectrum from a proto - planetary disk around a 0.5 m@xmath3 star . for the case with the smallest grains ,",
    "they predict thermal line ratios and a v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line strength 2.5 times as strong as what we report here for uy  aur  a. since uy  aur has a weaker x - ray luminosity than tw  hya ( by a factor of @xmath77 5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not surprising that uy  aur  a has a somewhat weaker line strength than predicted by the @xcite model .",
    "high density uv fluorescence combined with x - rays seems capable of generating much of the observed compact @xmath0 emission .",
    "veiling is the ratio of excess flux ( @xmath78 ) over photospheric flux ( @xmath79 ) at a given wavelength : @xmath80    since we did not observe photospheric calibrators for uy  aur  a and b , making a quantitative measurement of the veiling toward each source is difficult . without a photospheric template for each source we can not characterize internal instrumental scattered light , which can artificially veil our spectra ( see @xcite , for an example of instrumental veiling with aries ) .",
    "however , we can make a qualitative statement about the relative veiling between each source . in figure [ veilfig ]",
    "we show a portion of the spectra of both uy  aur  a ( top panel ) and uy  aur  b ( bottom panel ) in the vicinity of two strong aluminum photospheric absorption lines .",
    "we also plot synthetic phoenix photospheric spectra @xcite .",
    "the model spectra represent stars with logg=4.5 and t@xmath81=3900  k and t@xmath81=3500  k for uy  aur  a and b , respectively .",
    "we veiled the synthetic spectra by @xmath82 , 1.4 , 3 , and 7 .",
    "the @xmath83 value is that reported by @xcite for uy  aur a. as shown in the figure , @xmath83 matches our observation for uy  aur  a well , suggesting that instrumental veiling is weak or absent .",
    "our spectrum of uy  aur  b shows significantly weaker absorption lines than the @xmath84-depth lines observed in the r=250 spectrum reported by @xcite .",
    "thus we report that a large change in the k - band veiling of uy  aur  b has taken place since 1994 .",
    "in the previous section we presented the second ever k - band spectrum of uy  aur  b. we observe a @xmath85 magnitude increase in the flux of this source , together with increased veiling and decreased emission line luminosity .",
    "an increased circumstellar disk flux could explain both the increased k - band flux and the stronger veiling .",
    "such an increase could be due to an episodic increase in the mass accretion rate through the disk .",
    "however , we must understand why the observed br@xmath1 luminosity , a tracer of accretion onto the star , has decreased even while accretion through the disk has increased .",
    "one explanation appeals to a nearly edge - on viewing geometry to explain the increased luminosity of the disk and the decreased luminosity of the br@xmath1 line .",
    "several observations of the system hint at an edge - on orientation , including the unusually discrepant visual extinctions toward uy  aur  a and b @xcite , the extincted appearance of the 10-micron silicate feature @xcite , and the large amplitude optical and nir variability ( e.g. compare * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario ,",
    "when the scale height of the disk responds to the increased accretion rate and temperature becoming larger our view of the star becomes more obscured by the inner disk rim .",
    "thus , the intrinsic br@xmath1 luminosity can increase but be observed to decrease .",
    "we estimate the level of increased k - band extinction necessary to produce the observed change in the br@xmath1 luminosity given an assumed factor for the increased disk luminosity .",
    "measuring the increase in disk luminosity requires a previous quantitative measurement of the k - band veiling for uy  aur  b , which does not exist .",
    "we can make a ballpark estimate assuming that the previous veiling was @xmath86 , a common value for other classical t tauri stars @xcite , and qualitatively consistent with the previous k - band spectrum @xcite .",
    "for example , if the 0.86 magnitudes increase we observe in the k - band flux is driven by a factor of 3 increase in the luminosity of the disk , and we assume a similar increase in the intrinsic accretion luminosity of material making it onto the star , then we expect a factor of 2.4 increase in the intrinsic br@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "luminosity in @xcite ] however , the observed br@xmath1 line strength has decreased by a factor of 0.54 .",
    "this implies that only 23% of the br@xmath1 luminosity is passing through the puffed up disk rim , an increase in a@xmath87 of 1.6 .",
    "we convert such an increase in a@xmath87 to a change in column density along the observed line of sight using a value for the k - band dust opacity .",
    "we use @xmath88 @xmath89g@xmath4 , compatible with models of t tauri disk dust grains @xcite , to derive the required column density increase : 0.15 g/@xmath89 .",
    "the fractional increase implied by such a change depends on the initial column density along our line of sight .",
    "small fractional changes are required along lines of sight initially transecting optically thick portions of the inner rim while larger fractional changes are required along sight lines through more tenuous material .",
    "for example , if our sight line radially through the rim initially transected where @xmath90 , then a 3% change in the scale height of the disk is necessary",
    ". a 10% change in the scale height is required if our initial line of sight was through the rim at a height where @xmath91 .",
    "using l@xmath92t@xmath93 , and assuming a hydrostatic disk , h@xmath92c@xmath94@xmath92t@xmath95 , we expect a 14% increase in the scale height given our assumed increase in the luminosity of the disk .",
    "alternatively , if the observed decrease in the br@xmath1 flux and the increased disk luminosity implies an intrinsically lower accretion rate onto the central star , material flowing through the disk must accumulate at some radius or be ejected in an outflow before making its way onto the star . in a viscous accretion disk , mass is expected to pile up in regions with relatively low viscosity .",
    "@xcite described an accretion flow where the mid - plane of the disk at intermediate radii has very low viscosity because the gas , which is neutral there , is decoupled from the magnetic field .",
    "mass is predicted to accumulate in these  deadzones \" .",
    "@xcite pointed out that such an accumulation of mass would lead to instability , resulting either in the fragmentation of bound objects ( e.g. planets ) or in sufficient heating of the deadzone to ionize enough of the gas to couple the material there to the magnetic field , causing a sudden and dramatic increase in the accretion rate .",
    "if matter is indeed piling up in a deadzone , then we would expect uy  aur  b to undergo outbursts in the future .",
    "one clue that can help us understand the intrinsic accretion properties of uy  aur  b is the observation of extended outflows .",
    "mass - loss rates from young stars are correlated with mass accretion rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and outflows can be used as a tracer of accretion .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the observation of extended outflows surrounding uy  aur .",
    "these extended outflows should not be extincted by circumstellar disk material at small radii , and may give a clearer perspective on the intrinsic accretion rate of uy  aur  b. thus , time monitoring of outflow rates from uy  aur  b will help to constrain the physics of the variability in this source .",
    "additionally , both of the @xmath0 excitation scenarios discussed above ( shock or uv / x - ray excitation ) should produce @xmath0 lines with intensity that correlates with the accretion rate . for shocks , a larger accretion rate should result in a larger outflow rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , strengthening the @xmath0 signal .",
    "an increased accretion rate should also produce a stronger uv and x - ray accretion - shock spectrum and strengthen the fluorescent excitation .",
    "thus our observed decrease in @xmath0 line strength compared to the observations by @xcite may indicate a decrease in the intrinsic accretion rate .",
    "if the highly inclined geometry explanation for the behavior of uy  aur  b is correct , we predict that veiling , total flux , and outflow tracers of accretion should be correlated , but that shock - tracers of accretion ( such as h i lines like br@xmath1 ) should be anticorrelated .",
    "more frequent monitoring of this system will provide better knowledge of the nature and timescale of the variability and will be important in disentangling the physical state of uy  aur  b.    since the circumstellar disk around uy  aur  a is not edge on @xcite , we predict that all tracers of accretion , veiling , and total flux should be correlated .",
    "three epochs of published spatially separated k - band spectroscopy exist for uy  aur  a. the accretion rate seems to be increasing @xmath96 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 per year .",
    "uy  aur  a now has the larger observed br@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "in addition to the indicators included in our figure [ mdotsfig ] , further evidence that uy  aur  a has been trending toward a more active state can be seen in the comparison of the he i line shapes of @xcite and @xcite . in 2014",
    ", @xcite observed deeper red and blue shifted absorption features than @xcite .",
    "this suggests more vigorous infall and outflow from the source .",
    "additional evidence that uy  aur  a is now in an intrinsically more active state than uy  aur  b comes from the relative outflow rates .",
    "@xcite showed that uy  aur  a was driving an outflow at a larger rate than uy  aur  b in 2007 , consistent with our figure [ mdotsfig ] .",
    "however , if we assume the outflow is launched at the velocity observed by @xcite in the [ feii ] lines , @xmath97 km / s , then we expect @xmath98 year delay between variations in accretion at the stellar surface and variations in the observed outflow .",
    "if uy  aur  b is in fact accreting less than uy  aur  a then we must understand why the more vigorous accretor in uy  aur seems to alternate between the primary and the secondary .",
    "theory predicts that circumbinary disks should preferentially either the primary , as shown by @xcite , or the secondary as predicted by@xcite .",
    "one solution , which is consistent with the data , is that the accretion onto both sources , as traced by br@xmath1 , is episodic . in this way",
    "the average accretion rate onto the primary or secondary could dominate over time .",
    "this scenario has significant implications for planet formation because intense bursts of accretion can alter the chemical make - up and particle distribution in the disk by dissociating molecules and evaporating dust .",
    "another option is that the uy  aur binary system is substantially different from modeled systems .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite modeled systems with the implicit assumption that the binary seeds result from a disk fragmentation process .",
    "the possibly mis - aligned inclinations of the circumstellar disks in uy  aur is a clue that uy  aur may not have formed via disk fragmentation .",
    "this more complicated scenario is not as easily compared to clear - cut theoretical predictions .",
    "we have presented r=15,000 k - band spectroscopy of each star in the uy  aur binary system .",
    "our spectrum of uy  aur  b is only the second ever published and enables time domain studies at wavelengths probing both circumstellar material and accretion .",
    "we highlight significant changes since 1994 .",
    "specifically , we see that uy  aur  a presents increased br@xmath1 luminosity and now shows @xmath0 emission while uy  aur  b shows a decrease in the strength of br@xmath1 and @xmath0 emission .",
    "in contrast to the state of the system in 1994 , uy  aur  a now has the stronger observed br@xmath1 line .",
    "additionally , uy  aur  b now appears significantly brighter and more heavily veiled than it has in the past .",
    "we suggested two scenarios to explain the observed changes in the state of uy  aur  b. both cases include increased viscous accretion through the circumstellar disk to account for the increased luminosity and stronger veiling observed . in the first scenario a similar increase in the _ intrinsic _ br@xmath1 line strength is attenuated by increased extinction due to a puffed - up edge - on disk .",
    "we showed that the change in the scale height of the disk that is necessary to produce the reduced br@xmath1 line strength is compatible with the amount of change expected for a disk undergoing an episode of increased viscous accretion .",
    "alternatively , the observed reduction in the br@xmath1 line strength , and the accretion onto the star which it traces , is intrinsic . in this case ,",
    "mass flowing through the disk must pile up or be ejected before it reaches the star .",
    "we predict , if the edge - on disk scenario is correct , that future higher cadence time - monitoring of this system will reveal an anti - correlation in the variability of shock - tracers of accretion ( such as h i lines ) and the observed disk luminosity and veiling .",
