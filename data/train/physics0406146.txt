    "high energy ion accelerators , transport systems and storage rings @xcite have a wide range of applications ranging from basic research in high energy and nuclear physics , to applications such as heavy ion fusion , spallation neutron sources , and nuclear waste transmutation",
    ". of particular importance at the high beam currents and charge densities of interest for heavy ion fusion are the effects of the intense self - fields produced by the beam space charge and current on determining detailed equilibrium , stability , and transport properties . in general",
    ", a complete description of collective processes in intense charged particle beams is provided by the nonlinear vlasov - maxwell equations @xcite for the self - consistent evolution of the beam distribution function , @xmath0 , and the self - generated electric and magnetic fields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "while considerable progress has been made in analytical and numerical simulation studies of intense beam propagation @xcite , the effects of finite geometry and intense self - fields often make it difficult to obtain detailed predictions of beam equilibrium , stability , and transport properties based on the vlasov - maxwell equations . to overcome this complexity ,",
    "considerable theoretical progress has also been made in the development and application of one - dimensional vlasov - maxwell models @xcite to describe the longitudinal beam dynamics for a long coasting beam , with applications ranging from plasma echo excitations , to the investigation of coherent soliton structures , both compressional and rarefactive ( hole - like ) .",
    "such one - dimensional vlasov descriptions rely on using a geometric - factor ( @xmath3-factor ) model @xcite to incorporate the average effects of the transverse beam geometry and the surrounding wall structure . despite the many successful applications of such one - dimensional vlasov models to describe the longitudinal dynamics of long costing beams , even a one - dimensional vlasov description is often too complicated to be analyzed in detail , except in some simple limiting cases .",
    "the next level of description of the nonlinear beam dynamics is provided by the macroscopic fluid equations , which correspond to the first three momentum moments of the vlasov equation , with some particular closure scheme which relates the higher moments to the first three @xcite .",
    "the usual closure assumption for collisionless plasma is provided by the adiabatic equation of state ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the entropy per the unit volume ) , which expresses the thermal pressure as a function of the density . in one dimension , this is given by @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 is the line density of beam particles and @xmath8 is the line pressure .",
    "such a one - dimensional fluid model , combined with the adiabatic equation of state and a g - factor model for the average electric field , fits in the class of one - dimensional fluid problems which can be solved exactly @xcite using the formalism described in sec .",
    "ii .    in presently envisioned configurations for heavy ion fusion , multiple , high - current ,",
    "heavy ion beams are focused to a small spot size onto the target capsule . to achieve a high - intensity beam focused onto the target ,",
    "the beams are first accelerated and then compressed longitudinally .",
    "one of the possible ways to compress the beam longitudinally is to use a the drift compression scheme illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite .",
    "the scheme consists of two parts . in the first stage ,",
    "an initial tilt in the longitudinal velocity profile @xmath9 is imposed on the long charge bunch with some particular line density profile @xmath10 .",
    "after time @xmath11 , the beam line density evolves to a profile @xmath12 , with velocity profile @xmath13 . at this time , an additional velocity tilt @xmath14 is imposed on the beam , and the beam is left with line density @xmath12 and velocity tilt @xmath15 .",
    "we refer to this stage as the _ beam shaping _ stage .",
    "this stage requires beam manipulation ( imposing the velocity tilt ) and is done when the charge bunch is very long . at this stage ,",
    "the longitudinal pressure and electric field are negligible , and the beam dynamics is governed by free convection . during this stage the beam may or may not be compressed .",
    "the purpose of this stage is to shape the beam line density profile into a certain intermediate line density profile @xmath12 with velocity profile @xmath15 , such that during the next stage , which we refer to as the _ drift compression _ stage , after further axial drift during the time interval @xmath16 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , the beam is compressed longitudinally until the space - charge force or the internal thermal pressure stops the longitudinal compression of the charge bunch @xcite . at the point of maximum compression , the velocity tilt profile is completely removed and the beam is left with desired line density @xmath17 .",
    "the final focus magnets then focus the beam onto the target , and the beam heats and compresses the target fuel .",
    "stated this way , the longitudinal drift compression problem in the beam frame is equivalent to the time - reversed problem of the beam expanding into vacuum with zero initial velocity profile , and the specified initial line density profile @xmath17 which is desired at the time of maximum compression before final focusing . in this paper we employ a one - dimensional warm - fluid model with adiabatic equation of state to study this problem analytically for arbitrary final ( maximally compressed ) line density profiles @xmath17 .",
    "we consider here the two separate cases corresponding to a cold beam , and a pressure - dominated beam . in the case of a cold beam ,",
    "the internal thermal pressure is negligible , and the dynamics of the drift compression is governed by the self - generated electric field . in the case of a pressure - dominated beam ,",
    "the self - generated electric field is negligible , and the beam compresses under the influence of the thermal pressure and the initial velocity tilt @xmath15 .",
    "one of the compression scenarios considered for heavy ion fusion is _ neutralized _ drift compression , where the beam propagates through a charge - neutralizing background plasma as it compresses longitudinally .",
    "in such a scenario , the beam is compressed only against the internal pressure . for simplicity ,",
    "the present analysis is carried out in the beam frame where the particle motions are nonrelativistic .",
    "the final results can be then lorentz transformed back to the laboratory frame , moving with axial velocity @xmath18 relative to the average motion of the particles in the beam frame .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the one - dimensional warm - fluid model equations and the formalism used for solving them analytically . in secs .",
    "iii and iv , the general solution for the expansion problem ( the inverse to the _ drift compression stage _",
    "problem ) is obtained analytically for the two cases corresponding to a cold beam , and a pressure - dominated beam . in sec .",
    "v the general solution to drift compression stage obtained in secs .",
    "iii and iv is illustrated by several examples . in sec .",
    "vi we briefly discuss the _ beam shaping _ stage .",
    "in the present analysis , we employ a one - dimensional warm - fluid model @xcite to describe the longitudinal nonlinear beam dynamics with average electric field given by the g - factor model with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "for example , for a space - charge - dominated beam with flat - top density profile in the transverse plane , @xmath20 @xcite . here , @xmath21 is the line density , @xmath22 is the charge of a beam particle , @xmath23 is the conducting wall radius , and @xmath24 is the beam radius .",
    "generally , the beam radius , and therefore the @xmath3-factor , are functions of the line density and the external transverse focusing , and can change during the beam compression . in most of the drift compression scenarios it is preferable to maintain the beam radius ( and therefore the g - factor ) constant during the beam compression by adjusting the external transverse focusing @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present analysis , we assume that the g - factor is a constant .",
    "the macroscopic fluid equations for the line density @xmath21 , the average longitudinal beam velocity @xmath25 , and the longitudinal line pressure @xmath26 are given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 for a triple - adiabatic equation of state .",

    "iii - vi , in the remainder of this section we summarize well - established theoretical technique developed in fluid mechanics @xcite that can be used to solve the nonlinear fluid equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) . by introducing the velocity potential @xmath37 , where @xmath38",
