    "the next generation of wireless networks encounter different types of challenges such as meeting the requirements of new high - data rate applications , reducing the cost , and increasing the spectrum and infrastructure efficiency . in this context , recently , virtualization of wireless networks has been brought up as a promising approach to tackle these issues . in _",
    "virtualized wireless networks _ ( vwns ) , the physical resources of one network provider , e.g. , spectrum , power , and infrastructure , are shared between different service providers , also called slices @xcite .",
    "generally , each slice comprises of a set of users , and has its own quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements . to harvest the potential advantages of vwn ,",
    "effective resource allocation is a major concern which has been drawing a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , a resource management scheme is studied by introducing two types of slices , including rate - based and resource - based slices , where the minimum rate and minimum network resources are preserved for each slice , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , interactions among slices , network operator , and users are modeled as an auction game where the network operator is responsible for spectrum management on a higher level , and each slice focuses on qos management for its own users . to preserve the qos of slices from wireless channel fading ,",
    "the admission control policy is proposed in @xcite where the requirement of each slice is adjusted by the channel state information ( csi ) of its own users . to extend the feasibility condition of vwn in order to support diverse qos requirements ,",
    "@xcite considers the use of massive mimo where the access point is equipped with a large number of antennas . in @xcite , the combination of time",
    ", space and elastic resource allocation for ofdma system is considered .",
    "advantages of full - duplex transmission relay in vwn have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "generally , these works have focused on analyzing the resource allocation problem in a single - cell vwn scenario . however , in practice , the coverage of a specific region may require a set of bs , in a multi - cell vwn scenario .",
    "the key question in a multi - cell vwn scenario is how to allocate the resources to maintain the qos of each slice , while improving the total performance of vwn over a specific region . in this paper",
    ", we consider a multi - cell ofdm based vwn where the coverage of a specific region is provided by a set of bss serving different groups of users belonging to different slices .",
    "the qos of each slice is represented by its minimum reserved rate .",
    "each user of each slice can be only served by one bs and this bs is not predetermined by the distance or by measuring the average received signal strength of bss .",
    "consequently , in this setup , the resource sets in the related optimization problem involve the _ set of bss , sub - carriers and power _ for each user belonging to each slice .    in this paper ,",
    "the objective of proposed resource allocation problem is to maximize the total throughput of vwn in the specific region subject to power limitation of bss , minimum required rate of each slice , and sub - carrier and bs assignment limitations .",
    "based on the limitations of down - link ofdma transmission , each sub - carrier can be assigned to one user within a cell and each user can be associated to only one bs . since in this optimization problem , the sub - carrier assignment and bs association are inter - related , we introduce the user association factor ( uaf ) that jointly determines the bs assignment and sub - carrier allocation as the optimization variable vector . due to this user - association constraint and the inter - cell interference ,",
    "the proposed optimization problem is non - convex and np - hard , suffering from high computational complexity @xcite .",
    "we apply the frameworks of complementary geometric programming ( cgp ) and the successive convex approximation ( sca ) approach @xcite to develop an efficient , iterative , two - step algorithm to solve the proposed problem . for a given power - allocation",
    ", step 1 derives the optimum user - association solution , and subsequently , with this obtained user - association solution , step 2 finds the optimal power allocation .",
    "such 2-step optimization process is repeated until convergence .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that even the simplified problem of each step still involves non - convex optimization problem .",
    "thus , by applying various transformation and convexification techniques , we develop the analytical framework to transform the non - convex optimization problems encountered in each step into the equivalent lower - bound geometric programming ( gp ) problems , @xcite , which can be solved by efficient softwares , e.g. , cvx @xcite .",
    "simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly outperform the traditional scenario where the bs assignment is based on the largest average signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) , and subsequent sub - carrier and power allocation is derived for the users of each cell .",
    "the simulation results reveal that considering uaf can increase the feasibility of resource allocation problem ( the required rate of each slice will be satisfied with a higher probability as compared to the traditional approach ) .",
    "specifically , the proposed algorithm can significantly increase the probability of achieving higher rates for the cell - edge users , resulting better coverage for the vwn .",
    "our work in this paper lies along the intersection of two research contexts in resource allocation problems : 1 ) multi - cell ofdma wireless networks , and 2 ) vwns .",
    "there exists a large body of research conducted in resource allocation for multi - cell ofdma wireless networks .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the resource allocation in conventional ofdma - based network is studied using bs - assignment based on the largest average received signal strength from the bs at each user . an iterative algorithm for maximizing the weighted sum of minimal user rates in each bs",
    "is explored in @xcite .",
    "joint cell , channel and power allocation in multi - cell relay networks is explored in @xcite , where each user is assigned to the bs with the highest channel gain . in @xcite , a proportional fair resource allocation in a multi - cell ofdma networks",
    "is proposed with the aim of maintaining the quality of experience of users by considering a utility function based on the mean opinion score . in @xcite , joint scheduling of resource blocks , power allocation , and modulation and coding scheme in lte - a system",
    "is considered by using the criteria of proportional fairness .",
    "a similar problem in ofdma cognitive radio networks is studied in @xcite where an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the sub - carrier and power allocation . similarly , in @xcite , a resource allocation problem for jointly optimizing the energy and spectral efficiency",
    "is proposed for a multi - cell ofdma wireless network by considering an energy and spectral efficiency trade - off metric . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have considered an energy efficient resource allocation problem for a multi - cell ofdma network in a conventional wireless network where the available values of channel state information ( csi ) are imperfect . in @xcite ,",
    "a resource allocation algorithm is proposed for a two - cell down - link ofdma network with a fractional frequency reuse scheme between bss .    in the aforementioned works ( i.e. , @xcite ) , the bs assignment algorithm is separated from the sub - carrier allocation , while joint sub - carrier and power allocation is applied for multi - cell scenario .",
    "compared to this research direction , we consider uaf which jointly assigns the bs and sub - carrier for each user . in our proposed algorithm , after assigning uaf , the power allocation algorithm is applied .",
    "furthermore , we maintain the implementation limitations of multi - cell ofdma networks by proposing new constraints .    as previously mentioned , the resource allocation in vwns has received growing attention . in @xcite ,",
    "different aspects of vwn including resource discovery and allocation as well as the research challenges have been discussed .",
    "besides @xcite , in @xcite , the challenge in allocating physical resource blocks ( prbs ) to various slices in an lte network has been addressed considering a single bs scenario . in @xcite , an opportunistic algorithm to allocate the resources to virtual operators",
    "is proposed by differentiating the resource requirements among operators as baseline and fluctuate requirements to ensures the minimum qos requirements of each virtual operator . in @xcite , the concept of virtualization has been extended to a lte network by considering virtual operators or slices each with various bandwidth requirements in terms of the physical resource blocks ( prbs ) in lte . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the multi - cell scenario of vwns has not been studied in the previous related works in this context .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model and problem formulations are introduced .",
    "section iii contains mathematical background , the detailed explanation of iterative algorithms and computational complexity analysis .",
    "section iv demonstrates the simulation results and their detailed analysis followed by concluding remarks in section v.",
    "we consider the down - link transmission of a vwn where the coverage of a specific area is provided by the set of bss , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "the total bandwidth of @xmath3 hz is divided into a set of sub - carriers , @xmath4 and shared by all bss through orthogonal frequency - division multiple - access ( ofdma ) .",
    "the bandwidth of each sub - carrier , i.e. , @xmath5 , is assumed to be much less than the coherent bandwidth of the wireless channel , meaning that the channel response in each sub - carrier is flat .",
    "this set of bss serves a set of slices , i.e. , @xmath6 , where the slice @xmath7 has a set of users ( denoted by @xmath8 ) and requests for a minimum reserved rate of @xmath9 . a typical illustration of this setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ model pic ] , where @xmath10 is the total number of users .",
    "bss serving sets of users belonged to different slices . ]",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the channel state information ( csi ) of the link from bs @xmath13 to user @xmath14 of slice @xmath7 on sub - carrier @xmath15 and allocated power of user @xmath14 of slice @xmath7 on sub - carrier @xmath15 , respectively . in this scenario , due to the ofdma limitation , each user is assigned to one bs , and to avoid intra - cell interference , orthogonal sub - carrier assignment is assumed among users in a cell .",
    "we assume that there is no pre - allocated bs for users , and consider @xmath16 , which represents both sub - carrier allocation and bs assignment indicator for user @xmath14 of slice @xmath7 on sub - carrier @xmath15 of bs @xmath17 which has been called user association factor _",
    "( uaf)_. note that @xmath18 when bs @xmath17 allocates sub - carrier @xmath15 to user @xmath14 , and @xmath19 , otherwise .",
    "consider @xmath20_{\\forall m , g , n_g , k}$ ] and @xmath21_{\\forall m , g , n_g , k}$ ] as the vector of all transmit powers and uafs of users , respectively .",
    "therefore , the rate of user @xmath14 at sub - carrier @xmath15 of bs @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the interference observed by user @xmath14 in cell @xmath17 and sub - carrier @xmath15 , and @xmath24 is the noise power . without loss of generality ,",
    "noise power is assumed to be equal for all users in all sub - carriers and bss .",
    "now , from , the required minimum rate of slice @xmath25 can be represented as @xmath26 considering the maximum transmit power limitation of each bs , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the maximum transmit power of bs @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , the ofdma exclusive sub - carrier allocation within each cell @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath29 in this setup , due to the limitation of multi - cell ofdma , we restrict the access of each user by the following constraint @xmath30\\big[\\sum_{\\forall{m'}\\neq{m}}\\sum_{k\\in\\mathcal{k}}\\beta_{m',k , n_g}\\big]=0,\\quad \\\\ & \\forall{n_g\\in \\mathcal{n}_g},\\,\\,\\forall{g}\\in \\mathcal{g},\\,\\ , \\forall{m } \\in \\mathcal{m}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] c4 imposes that when sub - carrier @xmath15 from bs @xmath17 is assigned to user @xmath14 , it will not be assigned to user @xmath31 by bs @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "c4 is novel since it jointly assigns the bs and sub - carrier over the specific region .",
    "therefore , we call @xmath35 as the user association factor ( uaf ) which simultaneously determines the bs and sub - carrier in the vwn . the joint power , sub - carrier and bs assignment can be formulated as @xmath36 the optimization problem introduced in has a non - convex objective function due to inter - cell interference and involves non - linear constraints with combination of continuous and binary variables , i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in other words , is a non - convex mixed - integer , np - hard optimization problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , proposing the efficient algorithm with reasonable computational complexity is desirable .",
    "to tackle the computational complexity of , we adopt an iterative approach to iteratively find the uaf and power allocation for each user in two steps as shown in algorithm 1 . in step 1 , for given power allocation vector , the uaf considered as the variable of the user - association problem",
    "is solved by algorithm 1.a to be discussed in detail in section iii.b .",
    "this derived uaf is then used in step 2 to find the corresponding allocated power as the solution of the power - allocation optimization problem by algorithm 1.b to be discussed in detail in section ii.c .",
    "steps 1 and 2 are iteratively executed until both the current uaf and power allocation vector solutions are not much different from their values obtained in the previous iteration .",
    "in other words , the sequence of the uaf and power allocation vector solutions can be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the iteration number and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the optimal values at the iteration @xmath43 from convex transformation of related optimization problems in each step .",
    "the iterative procedure is stopped when @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "notably , both the user - association and power - allocation optimization problems are still non - convex and suffer high computational complexity . to solve them efficiently ,",
    "we apply complementary geometric programming ( cgp ) for each step @xcite in which via different transformations and convexification approaches , the sequence of lower bound gp based approximation of relative optimization problem is solved as described in detail in the following sections .      * initialization : * set @xmath47 , @xmath48 $ ] , where * 1 * is a vector , @xmath49 and the power over of each sub - carrier of bs @xmath17 is equal to @xmath50 . +",

[ background ] geometric programming ( gp ) is a class of non - linear optimization problems which can be solved very efficiently via numerical methods @xcite .",
    "thus , a significant amount of research has been done in order to convert the resource allocation problems into gp problems , so that it becomes computationally tractable @xcite .",
    "the standard form of gp is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 $ ] is a non - negative optimization variable vector , @xmath58 for all @xmath59 is a monomial function , i.e. , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 for all @xmath65 are posynomial functions , i.e. , @xmath66 . however , in , there are a lot of restrictions on the equality and inequality constraints which can not be met for many practical problems related to the resource allocation of wireless networks such as the optimization problem considered in this paper .",
    "for example , in some cases , the equality constraints contain posynomial functions , inequality constraints present lower bound of posynomial function or the posynomial functions contain negative coefficients . depending on the nature of the optimization problem , these types of problems belong to either one of classes of optimization problems such as generalized gp , signomial programming or complementary geometric programming ( cgp ) .",
    "a cgp can be presented as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 for all @xmath70 and @xmath71 in which @xmath72 , @xmath73 for all @xmath74 are posynomial functions , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are monomial and posynomial functions for all @xmath77 respectively , @xcite .    toward solving , one approach is to convert the cgp optimization problem into a sequence of standard gp problems @xcite that can be solved to reach a global solution .",
    "in other words , successive convex approximation ( sca ) is applied @xcite , where the non - convex optimization problem is approximated as a convex problem in each iteration .",
    "lets consider @xmath78 as an iteration number for this sequence .",
    "more specifically , arithmetic - geometric mean approximation ( agma ) can be applied to transform the non - posynomial functions to posynomial form , i.e. , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 to its monomial functions , respectively .    using agma , at the iteration @xmath78 , the approximated forms of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are @xmath83 and @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "it is because the feasibility region of resource allocation in is reduced by increasing @xmath176 , leading to less total achieved throughput @xcite .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , increasing @xmath176 has considerable effect on the performance of algorithm 2 compared to algorithm 1",
    ". it can be interpreted as algorithm 1 can efficiently control interference between different cells compared to algorithm 2 .",
    "therefore , the chance of feasible power allocation for larger values of @xmath176 is increased by algorithm 1 .    to study this point",
    ", we consider the outage probability of c1 , expressed as @xmath178 via mont carlo simulation , we derived pr(outage ) for the presented setup for both algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ op ] . in this figure",
    ", we assume @xmath179 and @xmath180 for all @xmath13 .",
    "the results demonstrate that as the rate reservation per slice @xmath176 increases , the outage probability for both algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 increases . however , algorithm 2 has larger value of outage probability compared to the outage probability of algorithm 1 , meaning that the feasibility region of algorithm 2 is smaller than that for algorithm 1 .",
    "on the other hand , algorithm 1 can efficiently manage interference in the specific region between different cells compared to algorithm 2 .",
    "it is mainly because algorithm 1 has more degree of freedom to choose the bs and allocate the sub - carriers among users of different slices .",
    "however , the bs assignment is predetermined in algorithm 2 .",
    "therefore , the achieved rate derived by algorithm 2 is less than that of algorithm 1 .",
    "consequently , with increasing @xmath176 , the decrease rate of algorithm 2 is greater than that of algorithm 1 , since algorithm 2 can not manage the interference between different bss .",
    "hence , algorithm 2 can not satisfy the minimum required rate of slices leading to decrement of vwn efficiency .",
    "for the same setup , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the total throughput of algorithms 1 and 2 are plotted for different values of @xmath176 .",
    "[ fig4 ] clearly shows that algorithm 1 yields higher throughput compared to algorithm 2 , while both of these algorithms become infeasible after @xmath181 bps / hz .",
    "we should emphasize that in all simulation results , when the problem is infeasible , i.e. , there is no power and sub - carrier vectors that can meet the constraint c1 for all @xmath25 , the achieved total rate is set to zero .          in any cellular network ,",
    "the coverage is one of the most important planning parameters which can be measured by sinr or achieved total rate of users at the cell boundaries . to study the performance of algorithm 1 to increase the coverage , we consider the simulation setup similar to fig .",
    "[ user_distribution ] where the majority of users are located in the cell - edge , consequently , these users experience high interference from other bss .",
    "therefore , the achieved rate of each user is decreased which can be considered as the worst - case scenario of coverage analysis .",
    "+    the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the total throughput of cell - edge users and cell - center users are depicted in figs .",
    "[ cdf ] and [ cell_center_cdf ] , respectively for both algorithms 1 and 2 .",
    "it can be seen that algorithm 1 outperforms algorithm 2 for the cell - edge users where 50% of users in the cell - edge achieve a throughput of @xmath182 bps / hz by algorithm 1 , while their throughput is around @xmath183 bps / hz via algorithm 2 .",
    "however , the performance of both algorithms are similar for the cell - center users . it is because via user - association in algorithm 1",
    ", the interference among different cells can be controlled while algorithm 2 can not control the interference through the connectivity of users to different bs and it is per - determined by the received sinr of reference signal . in other words ,",
    "algorithm 1 can provide better coverage even for cell - edge users for multi - cellular vwn which is desirable from implementation perspective .",
    "the performance is further investigated with respect to the number of users in the cell - edge in figs .",
    "[ uniform_users ] and [ nonuniform_users ] .",
    "obviously , algorithm 1 can consistently improve performance of cell - edge users and at the same time , maintain desirable throughput of each slice regardless of the user deployment density compared to the algorithm 2 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath184 , for the uniform user distribution , the total rate is increased from @xmath185 to @xmath186 bps / hz and from @xmath187 to @xmath188 bps / hz for cell - edge and cell - center users from algorithm 2 to algorithm 1 , i.e. , @xmath0 and @xmath189 , respectively . for the non - uniform case , when @xmath190 , the rate is incremented from @xmath185 to @xmath191 bps / hz and @xmath192 to @xmath193 bps / hz for cell - edge and cell - center users , respectively , which is equal to @xmath1 and @xmath194 increment in total rate from algorithm 2 to algorithm 1 , respectively .",
    "these results show the efficiency of applying algorithm 1 in increasing the coverage over the whole network .      in fig .",
    "[ itn_a ] , the number of iterations required for convergence for algorithms 1.a and 1.b versus the total number of sub - carriers , @xmath149 , is plotted for @xmath195 and @xmath196 bps / hz . similarly , in fig .",
    "[ itn_b ] , the number of iterations required for convergence versus the total number of users , @xmath197 for @xmath198 sub - carriers is plotted in the case of algorithm 1.a and 1.b . according to the computational complexity analysis in section iii.d , as @xmath150 and @xmath149 increase",
    ", the number of iterations required for convergence also increases .",
    "the computational complexity in the case of algorithm 1 . a is more than that of algorithm 1 .",
    "b owing to the fact that the total number of constraints for algorithm 1.a is higher than algorithm 1.b which is also evident from the plots of iterations versus @xmath150 and @xmath149 in fig .",
    "[ itn_a ] and fig .",
    "[ itn_b ] .",

    "we have considered a set of slices ( service providers ) , each has a set of their own users and require a minimum reserved rate .",
