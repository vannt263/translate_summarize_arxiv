    "( [ eq : spin_accumulation_seebeck ] ) generates spin current flowing along the @xmath41-direction through the interface , and produces the electric field @xmath168 along the @xmath38-direction by the inverse spin hall effect , which is proportional to @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "the voltage generated by the transverse spin seebeck effect is given by @xmath170 , where the integral range is over the length of the nonmagnet .",
    "when the center of the nonmagnet along the @xmath38-direction is same with that of the ferromagnet , the integral becomes zero , indicating that the transverse spin seebeck effect does not generates net voltage along the @xmath38-direction .",
    "this is because the electrons having the spin parallel and antiparallel to the magnetization of the ferromagnet equally contributes to the voltage with the opposite sign , and cancel each other .",
    "alternative method to separate the contribution from the transverse spin seebeck effect is to measure the voltages by changing the magnetization direction from @xmath171 to @xmath172 . in this case , the spin current originated from the spin seebeck effect changes the direction of the spin polarization , resulting in the sign change in the voltage through the inverse spin hall effect .",
    "on the other hand , the voltage originated from the anomalous nernst effect does not change the sign because the direction of the electrons flow simultaneously changes its direction .",
    "this difference can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin_current_def ] ) .",
    "the spin current originated from the spin seebeck effect is the vector product between the spin polarization ( @xmath173 ) and the current density , i.e. , @xmath174 , and therefore , changes the sign by the reversal of the magnetization direction from @xmath171 to @xmath172 .",
    "on the other hand , the spin current originated from the anomalous nernst effect is proportional to @xmath175 , which does not change the sign by the magnetization reversal .    in summary , the electric voltage measured in the geometry in fig . [ fig : fig1](a ) consists of three contributions , the voltages generated through the inverse spin hall effect via the anomalous nernst effect @xmath176 and the transverse spin seebeck effect @xmath177 , and the seebeck effect @xmath162 .",
    "the total voltage is @xmath178 .",
    "the contribution from the seebeck effect is separated by subtracting the voltage in the zero thickness limit , @xmath179 .",
    "the transverse spin seebeck effect does not contribute to the voltage when the centers of the nonmagnet and the ferromagnet are same .",
    "even if these centers locate at different positions , the contribution from the transverse spin seebeck effect is separated by comparing the voltages for @xmath180 , i.e. , @xmath181 .",
    "next , we consider the separation of the contribution from the transverse spin seebeck effect to the spin torque switching .",
    "similar to the above discussion , the transverse spin seebeck effect does not contribute to the switching when the nonmagnet locates on the center of the f@xmath59 layer , where the spin accumulation generated by the spin - dependent seebeck effect , eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin_accumulation_seebeck ] ) , is zero . on the other hand ,",
    "when the nonmagnet locates on different position , the transverse spin seebeck effect also excites spin torque on the magnetization in the f@xmath58 layer .",
    "the temperature gradient for the magnetization switching is , in general , sum of the contributions from the anomalous nernst effect @xmath182 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : critical_temperature ] ) and the transverse spin seebeck effect @xmath183 .",
    "we notice that the sign of the temperature gradient for the magnetization switching by the anomalous nernst effect changes its sign by changing the magnetization direction from @xmath184 to @xmath185 .",
    "this is because such change of the magnetization direction changes the flow direction of the electrons having the spin parallel and antiparallel to @xmath136 , and thus , the @xmath41 component of the spin polarization injected into the f@xmath58 layer also changes its sign . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath41 component of the spin polarization in the spin current originated from the transverse spin seebeck effect does not change its sign by such change of the magnetization direction .",
    "therefore , the contribution from the anomalous nernst effect to the magnetization switching is evaluated by comparing the temperature gradients of the switching for @xmath184 and @xmath185 , i.e. , @xmath186 .",
    "in conclusion , we developed a theory of spin transport in metallic ferromagnetic / nonmagnetic multilayer .",
    "we derived the theoretical formulas of the electric voltage via the inverse spin hall effect , eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_ishe ] ) , and the spin torque , eq .",
    "( [ eq : stt ] ) , excited through the anomalous nernst effect by using a phenomenological equation of the spin - dependent current , eq .",
    "( [ eq : current_def ] ) .",
    "the estimated value of the temperature gradient which is necessary to obtain a large voltage or torque for practical application is at least one to two orders of magnitude larger than the experimentally available value using the current technique .",
    "the experimental efforts recently made , such as the material investigation @xcite and structure improvement @xcite , however , will provide possibilities to observe these phenomena experimentally .",
    "the seebeck and transverse spin seebeck effects will also contribute to the experimental measurements .",
    "the contribution from the anomalous nernst effect can be , however , evaluated separately from these effects by measuring the thickness and/or magnetization direction dependences of the generated voltage and the temperature gradient for the magnetization switching .",
