    "the standard model ( sm ) with 45(+3 ) chiral fields is really remarkable .",
    "the big question in particle physics is , @xmath2how does this sm arise ? \" in late 1980s , there were attempts for standard - like models ( which has three families with the gauge group su(3)@xmath3su(2)@xmath3u(1)@xmath4 ) @xcite from the orbifold compactification of heterotic string .",
    "recent attempts have been more ambitious but it is fair to say that a model free of any phenomenological problems has not appeared yet even though partially attractive ones have been proposed in trinification , pati - salam , or just sm@xcite .",
    "so , searches for good supersymmetric ( susy ) standard models ( ssm ) are going on now vigorously .",
    "even some string models are suggested as roots for explaining the pvlas data @xcite . in this talk ,",
    "i follow the compactification route through orbifolds .",
    "orbifolds are manifolds modded by discrete actions .",
    "a nice feature of the orbifold compactification is that it is basically a geometric one .    for an ssm ,",
    "we may obtain it either directly from compactification or through an intermediate step of susy gut . in @xmath0 , we have constructed both kinds @xcite , and here we focus on the direct construction .    in the orbifold construction , there has been the adjoint difficulty that at the kac - moody level @xmath5 there does not appear an adjoint matter representation .",
    "thus , guts su(5 ) , so(10 ) , and e@xmath6 are not good candidates toward ssms simply because the higgs mechanism for breaking the gut group is not present .",
    "this prefers guts with factor groups such as su(3)@xmath7 , su(4)@xmath3su(2)@xmath3su(2 ) and su(5)@xmath3u(1 ) .",
    "the trinification su(3)@xmath7 is possible only in @xmath8 which is nice toward achieving @xcite @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath10 problem , there are several problems to be explained in those models ,    * approximate @xmath1-parity for proton longevity , * exotics problem , * vectorlike pairs problem , * successful fit to quark and lepton masses and mixing angles , * strong cp problem @xcite , etc .    among all these problems ,",
    "the most difficult and urgent one to overcome is the @xmath1-parity problem .",
    "one of the nice features of so(10 ) gut is said to be that it has a scheme to introduce the @xmath1-parity .",
    "noting that so(10 ) has both spinor ( @xmath11 ) and vector ( @xmath12 ) representations , one can assign @xmath13 for @xmath11 and @xmath14 for @xmath12 and then tree level couplings respect the @xmath1-parity",
    ". however , this is true only when gauge singlets are not introduced .",
    "the gauge singlets present in string compactification may behave like a spinor or a vector and the above simple argument of so(10 ) gut is not applicable to ssms from string compactification .",
    "thus , the @xmath1-parity consideration is most important .",
    "only , approximate @xmath1-parity is obtained in string models so far @xcite .",
    "previous ssms from string have not obtained the @xmath1-parity problem properly .",

    "the 3rd family quark masses arise from @xmath87 and @xmath88 which are cubic .",
    "but we need much more couplings to make this model phenomenologically successful .",
    "since there are o(100 ) chiral fields , a computer search may be necessary .",
    "we have shown @xcite that if neutral singlets are allowed to get gut scale vevs then all the needed phenomenology can be met , in particular vectorlike exotics and non - exotic vectorlike pairs obtain large masses .",
    "also , supersymmetric conditions the @xmath89-flatness and @xmath90-flatness have to be checked in a specific model for given singlet vevs @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath1-parity needs a special treatment on which we will comment shortly .    before discussing the @xmath1-parity , we point out that now it is possible to study an approximate global symmetry .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath0 flipped su(5 ) model @xcite , we studied an approximate peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite .",
    "we studied u(1)@xmath91u(1)@xmath92 where u(1)@xmath92 is an approximate one .",
    "we find that the qcd axion is possible and obtained the axion - photon - photon coupling for the first time from string compactification , @xmath93 where 1.93 appears from the qcd chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the decay constant turns out to be at the gut scale and hence it is very difficult to observe the very light axion from the cavity experiments even though we invoke the anthropic principle for the misalignment problem . in fig .",
    "[ axionexp ] , the above axion - photon - photon coupling strength is compared to the recent solar axion search from cast @xcite .    this kind of study on approximate symmetries can be done in a specific model . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath1-parity must be studied in a specific model as performed in the flipped su(5 ) @xcite . a probable failure in obtaining an @xmath1-parity",
    "is that one needs many singlet vevs for other phenomenological reasons .",
    "the approximate @xmath1-parity in ref . [ 8 ] was obtained by studying yukawa couplings up to dimension 7 . but a better way is to embed the @xmath1-parity or matter parity - parity .",
    "so we use both words without distinction . ] in an anomaly free u(1 ) gauge group .",
    "a parity is a @xmath20 operation .",
    "some vevs of the u(1 ) charge carrying fields can break u(1 ) down to @xmath18 if the field carries @xmath94 units of the fundamental u(1 ) charge .",
    "if we normalize the smallest nonvanishing u(1 ) charge as @xmath95 , then a vev of u(1 ) charge @xmath94 field breaks u(1)@xmath96 .",
    "so if only even integer u(1 ) charge fields , including @xmath97 , are given vevs then the final discrete group is @xmath20 , and we succeed in obtaining a matter parity .",
    "however , if some phenomenological reasons dictate some @xmath98 fields develop gut scale vevs , we do not obtain such a matter parity . in this case",
    ", we can resort only to an approximate matter parity .    in the  group space ,",
    "the weights are divided into two classes , the vector type  and the spinor type . in the u sector , the vector type has the form of @xmath44 such as @xmath99 while the spinor type has the form of @xmath44 such as @xmath100 below we will represent @xmath101 simply as @xmath102 . in the t sector , @xmath103 are considered to see whether some components are of the vector type or of the spinor type . if we pick up the u(1)@xmath75 charge of the flipped su(5 ) @xmath104 the vector type weight ( [ vecwt ] ) has an even number for @xmath105 eigenvalue while the spinor type weight ( [ spwt ] ) has an odd number for @xmath105 eigenvalue .",
    "this results because we have an odd number of entries of 2 in eq .",
    "( [ xflip ] ) .",
    "so this u(1)@xmath75 can be a good mother for the matter parity . if we consider three entries of 2 , it is three times u(1)@xmath106 of eq .",
    "( [ bml ] ) which can be another good mother group for the matter parity . @xmath107 and @xmath108 can do the same job . out of these five , only four u(1)s are considered to be independent .",
    "note that all sm particles of table [ tb : sm ] are of  type and some needed higgs doublets are of  type .",
    "so if all the needed vevs of gauge singlets are of  type , then we achieve introducing an exact matter parity in that model .",
    "however , if some  singlet(s ) is required to have a gut scale vev(s ) , then the matter parity introduced is not exact .",
    "the charge of the hypothetical mother u(1)@xmath79 group is given in eq .",
    "( [ u1gamma ] ) which has an odd number of 2 entries .    in table",
    "[ tb : singneutral ] , we list gauge singlets with u(1)@xmath79 charges . here in the @xmath109 column , singlets having odd @xmath109 charges are boxed .",
    "we have to check whether phenomenology needs definitely one of these to develop a large vev or not .",
    "if we can choose a vacuum where it is not necessary for any of these to develop a large vev , then we can introduce an exact matter parity .",
    "but to make all exotics heavy , we need @xmath110 and @xmath111 . so an exact @xmath1-parity is not introduced in the model . however , we note that even if we obtained an exact @xmath1-parity , proton still decays by dimension-5 operators @xmath112 so an exact @xmath1-parity conservation requirement can be considered as an over - requirement with respect to the proton longevity problem .",
    "an approximate @xmath1-parity with proton lifetime comparable to that coming from dimension-5 operators is a good enough parity .",
    "however , if one requires an absolutely stable lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , the exact @xmath1-parity might be a good requirement .",
    "however , here also the lsp with its lifetime much larger than the age of universe can be considered as a good dark matter candidate .",
    "the dimension-4 operator @xmath113 is particularly problematic if there exists a tree level lepton number violating operator also . in our model",
    ", @xmath113 carries @xmath114 , so to have a dimension-4 @xmath113 coupling we need composite singlets carrying @xmath115 : @xmath116 @xmath117 to obtain @xmath118 from @xmath116 , we need for example @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a @xmath121 field and @xmath122 is a @xmath123 field .",
    "other singlets having nonvanishing vevs must belong to @xmath124 .",
    "we can check that with these combinations we can not satisfy the modular invariance condition @xmath125 mod 12 .",
    "this implies that in the vacuum we choose the coupling @xmath113 does not appear at all .",
    "however , the matter parity or the @xmath1-parity is broken by heavy intermediate states , which is nothing but those appearing in gut models .",
    "so we estimate that the lightest neutralino lifetime is around @xmath126 years through @xmath1-parity violating interactions , considering heavy particles , which is long enough to be considered as a dark matter candidate .",
    "we reviewed very briefly the orbifold compactification .",
    "as a definite acceptable example , we constructed a @xmath0 orbifold model with the sm gauge group and three families in which we achieve    * all exotics are removed by singlet vevs , * the 3rd family appears in the u sector , * the weak mixing angle is @xmath9 , and * an effective @xmath1-parity without @xmath113 coupling can be introduced .",
    "still the neutralino can be a dark matter candidate .    in another vacuum",
