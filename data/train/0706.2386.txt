    "the observation and modeling of the spectral line polarization produced by radiatively induced quantum coherences in atomic systems provides a novel diagnostic window to explore the magnetism of the sun and of other stars via the hanle effect ( e.g. , the recent monograph by landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 ) .",
    "for the moment , such scattering polarization signals have been observed without or with poor spatial and/or temporal resolution ( e.g. , stenflo & keller 1997 ; trujillo bueno et al . 2001 ; malherbe et al .",
    "however , as shown in this work , there are important scientific reasons to try to observe them with a spatial resolution significantly better than 1 arcsec , so as to be able to see clearly the details of the solar granulation pattern .    in the apparently quiet regions of the solar atmosphere",
    "there are three main reasons for expecting spatial variability in the linear polarization signals produced by scattering processes .",
    "first , the atmospheric inhomogeneities produced by the solar surface convection lead to horizontal fluctuations in the anisotropy of the radiation field , which must have their impact on the polarization of the emergent radiation ( trujillo bueno 2003 ; trujillo bueno et al .",
    "second , the same atmospheric inhomogeneities should lead to local symmetry breaking effects , so that the radiation field loses the axial symmetry that is characteristic of a plane - parallel or spherically symmetric stellar atmosphere model . as a result , as pointed out by manso sainz & trujillo bueno ( 1999 ) through two - dimensional radiative transfer calculations in simplified solar model atmospheres , one can have scattering line polarization even at the center of the solar disk , without the need of an inclined magnetic field .",
    "third , the scattering polarization signals are sensitive to magnetic fields via the hanle effect , and could therefore show fluctuations across the observed field of view if the statistical properties of the hidden field are not homogeneous , as is indeed indicated by a joint analysis of the hanle effect in atomic and molecular lines ( trujillo bueno et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 ) .",
    "in this letter we present simulated polarimetric observations for the well - known case of the sr i 4607   line , which we have obtained by solving the radiative transfer problem of scattering line polarization in a realistic three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamical model of solar surface convection .",
    "observations of the spatial variations of the scattering polarization in the sr i 4607   line have shown that these variations are very small and next to invisible with the used resolution ( e.g. , stenflo et al . 1997 ; trujillo bueno et al .",
    "2001 ; malherbe et al .",
    "2007 ) , in contrast to the large spatial variations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 seen in much stronger lines like ca i 4227  ( e.g. , fig .",
    "5 in stenflo 2004 ) and ca ii k ( e.g. , fig . 4 in stenflo 2006 ) , which have been tentatively interpreted in terms of largely resolved magnetic fields in the solar chromosphere . while the chromosphere has prominent inhomogeneities on the supergranular scales , which are well resolved in the mentioned observations , the quiet photosphere varies on the scale of the solar granulation , which has so far been below the resolution that has been achieved in combination with high - precision spectro - polarimetry .    in our previous 3d radiative transfer investigations ( shchukina & trujillo bueno 2003 ; trujillo bueno et al .",
    "2004 ) only the influence of the mean intensity and anisotropy of the sr i 4607   line radiation was accounted for .",
    "here we consider the full 3d scattering line polarization problem in the same realistic hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere , including the hanle effect of a microturbulent magnetic field , but taking into account the above - mentioned symmetry breaking effects that we had previously neglected .",
    "as we shall see , we confirm our conclusions concerning the presence of a substantial amount of hidden magnetic energy in the quiet regions of the solar photosphere .",
    "in addition , we report on the new interesting results summarized in the abstract .",
    "we have solved the 3d scattering polarization problem for the sr i 4607   line in a realistic model of the solar photosphere resulting from the hydrodynamical simulations of solar surface convection by asplund et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "first , we calculated the number density of sr i atoms at each grid - point of the 3d photospheric model and the overall population of the lower and upper levels of the 4607   line transition , whose total angular momentum values are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . to this end",
    ", we solved the standard non - lte radiative transfer problem including all the allowed radiative and collisional transitions between the 15 bound levels of a realistic model of sr i and the ensuing ionizing transitions to the ground level of sr ii .",
    "it is important to calculate the ionization balance of strontium without assuming lte and using a realistic atomic model in order to account properly for the uv overionization mechanism by means of which all the sr i levels become significantly underpopulated with respect to the lte case ( shchukina & trujillo bueno 2003 ) .",
    "we point out that with the resulting self - consistently calculated populations , the computed spatialy - averaged emergent intensity profiles ( which take into account the doppler shifts of the convective flow velocities in the 3d model ) turn out to be in excellent agreement with the observations .",
    "our second step consisted in calculating , at each grid - point of the 3d model , the self - consistent values of the six multipolar components of the atomic density - matrix that characterize the excitation state of the upper level of the sr i 4607   line transition , using the previously calculated lower level population values .",
    "such density - matrix elements quantify the overall population of the upper level ( via the @xmath4 component ) , the level s population imbalances ( via the @xmath5 component ) and the quantum coherences between each pair of magnetic sublevels pertaining to the upper level ( via the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 components ) .",
    "to this end , we solved iteratively the set of equations that results from combining the radiative transfer equations for the stokes parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the following statistical equilibrium equations , whose derivation can be found in appendix a of trujillo bueno & manso sainz ( 1999 ) :    @xmath11    and    @xmath12    \\left ( \\begin{array}{l }         { s^2_0 } \\\\         { \\tilde{s}^2_1 } \\\\        { \\hat{s}^2_1 } \\\\         { \\tilde{s}^2_2 } \\\\         { \\hat{s}^2_2 }      \\end{array } \\right ) =      ( 1-\\epsilon ) \\ , w^{(2)}_{j_uj_l } \\ , { \\cal { h}}^{(2 ) }    \\left ( \\begin{array}{r }        { j}^2_0 \\\\        \\tilde{j}{}^{2}_{1 } \\\\        -\\hat{j}{}^{2}_{1 } \\\\",
    "\\tilde{j}{}^{2}_{2 } \\\\",

    "we point out that @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) are complex quantities and that in eq .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath20 and @xmath21 indicate the _ real _ parts , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 the _ imaginary _ parts .",
    "the expressions we have used for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) are those given by eqs .",
    "( 4)-(7 ) in trujillo bueno ( 2001 ) , taking into account the doppler shifts caused by the convective velocities .",
    "note also that @xmath26 is the hanle depolarization factor of a microturbulent magnetic field ( see eq .",
    "a.16 in trujillo bueno & manso sainz 1999 ) , @xmath27 is the collisional destruction probability due to inelastic collisions with electrons ( e.g. , shchukina & trujillo bueno 2001 ) , @xmath28 is the collisional depolarizing rate due to elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms measured in units of the einstein a@xmath29 coefficient ( e.g. , faurobert - scholl et al .",
    "1995 ) , and @xmath30 is a coefficient whose value is unity for the sr i 4607   line under consideration .",
    "the spherical components of the radiation field tensor are given by angular and frequency weighted averages of the stokes parameters .",
    "thus , @xmath31 quantifies the mean intensity of the spectral line radiation , @xmath32 the anisotropy factor , and @xmath33 ( with @xmath19 ) the breaking of the axial symmetry of the radiation field through the complex azimuthal exponentials that appear inside the angular integrals ( i.e. , @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the azimuth of the ray ) .",
    "we point out that while @xmath35 and @xmath37 are zero in a plane - parallel or spherically symmetric model atmosphere in the absence or in the presence of a microturbulent magnetic field , they turn out to fluctuate horizontally at each height in the above - mentioned 3d hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere , with sizable positive and negative values mainly around the boundaries between the granular and intergranular regions .",
    "the statistical equilibrium equations have a clear physical meaning .",
    "in particular , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) describe the transfer of the symmetry properties of the radiation field directly to the atomic system .",
    "therefore , without the need of a magnetic field ( i.e. , for @xmath39 ) optical pumping processes can generate both _ population imbalances _",
    "( if @xmath40 ) and _ coherences _ ( if @xmath41 and/or @xmath42 ) . in the presence of a microturbulent magnetic field",
    "the population imbalances ( @xmath43 ) and the quantum coherences ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) are reduced because @xmath26 varies between 1 ( for @xmath46 g ) and 0.2 ( for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the land factor of the upper level ) .",
    "our numerical solution of this physical problem is based on the iterative methods developed by trujillo bueno & manso sainz ( 1999 ) , which require calculating the radiation field tensors @xmath50 at each iterative step . since the lower - level of the sr i 4607   line has @xmath2 , it can not be polarized .",
    "therefore , the transfer equation for stokes @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 ) is simply given by @xmath53 , which we have solved by applying the 3d formal solver of fabiani bendicho & trujillo bueno ( 1999 ) .",
    "the line contributions to @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the following ( e.g. , manso sainz & trujillo bueno 1999 )    @xmath56    @xmath57 @xmath58 and    @xmath59    @xmath60 where the orientation of the ray is specified by @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 the polar angle ) and by the azimuthal angle @xmath38 . the exact expression for @xmath63 that we have used in our calculations is as complicated as the two previous ones ( see eq . 14 in manso sainz & trujillo bueno 1999 ) , but in a weakly anisotropic medium like the solar photosphere @xmath64 .",
    "note also that at the line center of a significantly strong spectral line an approximate expression for estimating the emergent fractional linear polarization is @xmath65 ( for @xmath66 ) , with the corresponding source function values calculated at the atmospheric height where the line center optical depth is unity along the line of sight .",
    "it is important to point out that the above - mentioned symmetry breaking effects imply non - zero values for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which in turn imply non - zero values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "2 ) . note also from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) that their main observable effects would be non - zero stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 signals at the solar disk center ( @xmath71 ) and non - zero stokes @xmath1 signals at any off - disk - center position .",
    "let us show now how large such fractional polarization signals are expected to be at three on - disk positions ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath71 ) , taking into account the diffraction limit effect of a 1-m telescope ( which we have accounted for through convolution with the airy function ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the center - to - limb variation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 line - center signals of the sr i 4607   line , which we have obtained by solving the scattering line polarization problem in the above - mentioned 3d hydrodynamical model without magnetic fields .",
    "we point out that in each panel of fig . 1 there are some points of the field of view with signals outside the minimum and maximum values that we have chosen to optimize the visualization .    as expected , at @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see the left and middle top panels of fig .",
    "1 ) the @xmath0 signals are almost everywhere positive , because far away from the solar disk center the term of eq .",
    "( 3 ) proportional to @xmath74 makes the dominant contribution , which quantifies the anisotropy factor of the radiation field . in any case",
    ", it is important to point out that the other terms of eq .",
    "( 3 ) ( i.e. , those caused by the symmetry breaking effects quantified by the @xmath67 and @xmath68 tensors ) do influence the local values of @xmath0 . ] . in the absence of magnetic fields",
    "@xmath0 at @xmath72 varies between about @xmath75 and @xmath76 , while the range of variation at @xmath73 lies between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the spatially averaged @xmath0 amplitude is about @xmath79 at @xmath72 and @xmath80 at @xmath73 , which is in agreement with the results of trujillo bueno et al .",
    "the standard deviations ( @xmath81 ) of the @xmath0 fluctuations are approximately @xmath80 at @xmath72 and @xmath82 at @xmath73 . as shown in the corresponding bottom panels of fig .",
    "1 the stokes @xmath1 signals are very significant , with a typical spatial scale of the fluctuation similar to that of @xmath0 , but with positive and negative values lying between about @xmath83 and @xmath75 at @xmath73 ( with a @xmath84 ) and between @xmath85 and @xmath86 at @xmath72 ( with a @xmath87 ) .",
    "such @xmath1 signals are exclusively due to the symmetry breaking effects caused by the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities , which are quantified by the tensors @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the spatially averaged @xmath1 amplitudes are not zero , although they are rather small ( e.g. , @xmath90 at @xmath73 ) .",
    "the right panels of fig . 1 show that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 signals at the solar disk center ( @xmath71 ) are significant and that they have subgranular patterns . in this forward scattering geometry",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 have positive and negative values , which are exclusively due to the symmetry breaking effects ( see eqs . 3 and 4 for @xmath71 ) .",
    "in the unmagnetized case of fig .",
    "1 such values vary between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , approximately , but with most of the @xmath0 signals located between @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( with a @xmath95 ) .",
    "as expected , the spatially averaged @xmath0 and @xmath1 values at the solar disk center are very small that is , of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "figure 2 shows again results for the @xmath73 case , but assuming a particularly interesting magnetized model characterized by a horizontally fluctuating microturbulent field with @xmath97 g at all heights within the solid - line contours of the right panels of fig .",
    "1 ( which delineate the granular upflowing regions ) and @xmath98 g at all heights outside such solid - line contours ( which correspond to the downflowing intergranular regions ) . this model implies saturation of the hanle effect for the sr i 4607   line in the intergranular regions of the photospheric plasma , as suggested by the hanle - effect investigation of trujillo bueno et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2006 ) .",
    "the spatially averaged @xmath0 amplitude is now about @xmath82 ( instead of the @xmath80 value corresponding to the unmagnetized case of fig .",
    "1 ) , while the amplitude of the spatially averaged @xmath1 profile is only @xmath99 ( instead of @xmath100 ) .",
    "the most remarkable point is found when comparing the patterns of fig .",
    "2 with those of the middle panels of fig .",
    "now , in the magnetized case under consideration , the contrast of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluctuations across the field of view is significantly reduced , as a result of having assumed the largest possible hanle depolarization in the intergranular regions .",
    "a similar conclusion is obtained for the other line - of - sights considered in fig . 1",
    ".    the use of a 1-m telescope equipped with adaptive optics should be sufficient to measure with a spatial resolution of 100 km and a temporal resolution shorter than 60 sec the predicted linear polarization signals with a polarimetric sensitivity better than @xmath101 .",
    "a suitable instrument for detecting the reported small - scale fluctuations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 would be a fabry - perot interferometer combined with a modern polarimeter .",
    "particular attention should be given to the spectral resolution of the instrument , since an instrumental profile with a too large full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) value would significantly reduce the amplitudes of the measured @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluctuations .",
    "a fwhm@xmath102 m  seems to be appropiate , given that for 25 m  the minimum and maximum @xmath0 values at @xmath73 would be @xmath103 and @xmath104 , instead of the @xmath77 and @xmath78 values corresponding to the infinite spectral resolution case of fig .",
    "1 . therefore",
    ", a fabry - perot system based on two or three etalons would be advisable .",
    "probably , the most interesting conclusion of this investigation is that the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities caused by the solar surface convection give rise to measurable linear polarization in the emergent radiation of the sr i 4607   line at the solar disk center .",
    "such @xmath0 and @xmath1 disk - center signals have positive and negative values fluctuating horizontally with a sub - granular pattern .",
    "they are exclusively due to the breaking of the axial symmetry of the radiation field that illuminates the atomic system , which induces quantum coherences between the magnetic sublevels of the upper level of the sr i 4607   line without the need of an inclined magnetic field .",
    "actually , such symmetry breaking effects produce sizable @xmath1 signals at any on - disk position , with positive and negative values fluctuating across the field of view with an amplitude that increases towards the solar limb . on the other hand , with the exception of the previously mentioned forward scattering disk - center case ,",
    "the @xmath0 signals far away from the solar disk center are instead dominated by the anisotropy of the radiation field and fluctuate around a non - zero mean value which is the larger the closer to the solar limb .",
    "the local @xmath0 values are influenced by the symmetry breaking effects , but the spatially averaged @xmath0 amplitudes at each @xmath105 position turn out to be similar to those calculated by trujillo bueno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which confirms their conclusion on the presence of a significant amount of hidden magnetic energy and ( unsigned ) magnetic flux in the quiet solar photosphere .",
    "the reported patterns in the fractional linear polarization are of great diagnostic interest because they are sensitive to the thermal , dynamic and magnetic structure of the quiet solar atmosphere .",
    "we urge our solar observer colleagues to carry out the proposed observations as soon as possible . while a 1-m telescope with adaptive optics should be sufficient for the strongly polarizing sr i 4607   line",
    ", the observation of this type of linear polarization signals in most of the other lines of the second solar spectrum would require a larger aperture solar telescope and @xmath1 fluctuations are those of the solar granulation .",
    "the design of the european solar telescope ( est ) and of the advanced technology solar telescope ( atst ) should be done thinking seriously in the scientific case of this letter . to detect and quantify the predicted fluctuations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 across a two - dimensional field of view",
    "would be of fundamental importance to decipher the small - scale magnetic activity of our nearest star ."
