    "one of the outstanding yet most important problems in astrophysics is how and when galaxies formed within the framework of the expanding universe described by the concordance model of cosmology .",
    "massive galaxies at high @xmath2 become more and more important to study .",
    "in fact , the availability of multi - wavelength data from new generations of deep surveys , including wide field panoramic surveys , allowed for searches for such massive galaxy candidates up to @xmath3 @xcite or even @xmath4 @xcite . however , still very few is known about the physical processes underlying the ( putative ) presence of such massive systems at these high redshifts .",
    "in fact , the mere existence of them could seem paradoxical within a direct interpretation of the hierarchical structure formation scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further , such possible contradictions are not necessarily alleviated by the competing monolithic collapse scenario @xcite and hence the question about the existence ( and the properties ) of massive galaxies at high - redshift remains open .",
    "recently , a scenario has emerged to explain massive galaxy formation that shares characterisctics of both the aforementioned classical scenarios , but is nevertheless different .",
    "indeed , analytical models @xcite , as well as n - body simulations @xcite , have shown that two different phases can be distinguished along _ halo _",
    "mass assembly : i ) first , a violent , fast phase , with high mass aggregation ( i.e. , merger ) rates , ii ) later on , a slow phase , where the mass aggregation rates are much lower .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations have confirmed this scenario and its implications for properties of massive galactic objects at low @xmath2 , see @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite . concerning high @xmath2s",
    ", it has been shown that the fast phase has the characteristics of a _ multiclump collapse _",
    ", where mergers involve very low relative angular momentum , and , in fact , they are induced by the collapse of flow convergence regions displaying a web - like morphology @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we investigate the high mass end of galactic stellar objects at high - redshift ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 ) obtained by means of self - consistent cosmological simulations within a volume large enough to account for the proper treatment of the large - scale structure yet simultaneously capturing all the relevant small - scale ( baryonic ) physics .",
    "not only do we investigate their mere presence , we also study whether they had enough time to dynamically relax at such high redshifts . to this end",
    ", we have focused on the intrinsic mass ( as opposed to luminosity ) as well as structural and kinematical properties of these objects at their halo ( i.e. virial radius ) and stellar / galactic scale ( to be defined below ) as fingerprints of the physical processes involved in their assembly .",
    "specifically , we investigate the appearence of samples of high-@xmath2 massive galactic objects with dynamical planes tilted relative to the virial plane , and link their underlying formation physics to the adhesion model @xcite .",
    "our results here are an extension to higher @xmath2s of previous studies on the fundamental plane ( fp ) at @xmath7 @xcite . in these two papers",
    "the different possibilities causing the tilt of the fp relative to the virial plane are analyzed in detail .",
    "it is shown that that if both the virial mass to luminosity ratio , @xmath8 , and the mass structure coefficient @xmath9 ( see eqs . 2 and 4 in @xcite )",
    "are independent of mass , then no fp tilt would be measured . here , because mass is considered instead of luminosity and no projection effects are taken into account , we have instead analyzed the mass dependence of the ratio @xmath10 and the mass structure coefficient @xmath11^{2 }    { r_{\\rm e , bo}^{\\rm star}})$ ] , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the stellar mass and the 3d stellar velocity dispersion at the galactic scale , respectively , and @xmath14 is the 3d stellar mass effective radius also defined at the galactic scale . we need to stress that a mass dependence of either of these quantities automatically implies a tilt of the dynamical plane relative to the virial plane .",
    "the simulations used here are part of the galfobs project . they are @xmath15-body @xmath16 sph simulations that have been performed using an openmp parallel version of the ` deva ` code @xcite and the methods for star formation and cooling described in @xcite .",
    "the ` deva ` code pays particular attention to ensure that conservation laws ( e.g. momentum , energy , angular momentum , and entropy ) hold as accurately as possible .",
    "star formation is implemented through a kennicutt - schmidt - like law with a density threshold @xmath17 and a star formation efficiency of @xmath18 .",
    "the values of these parameters implicitly account for star formation regulation by discrete energy injection processes .",
    "the main simulation was carried out in a periodic cube of 80 mpc side length using @xmath19 baryonic and @xmath19 dark matter particles with a gravitational softening of @xmath20 kpc and a minimum hydrodynamical smoothing length half this value .",
    "the cosmology applied was a @xmath21cdm model whose parameters as well as those of the field of primordial density fluctuations ( i.e. , initial spectrum ) have been taken from cmb anisotropy data @xcite , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , an initial power - law index @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the mass resolution is @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the star formation parameters used were @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    when analyzing galaxy formation in numerical simulations it is desirable to verify that the objects in the simulation are consistent with observations at low @xmath2 s . due to the extreme cpu consumption by hydrodynamical forces ,",
    "this is not yet possible for the main galfobs simulation . as a way out , we ran three sub - volumes of the main cube using a `` zoom approach '' . in this approach the gravitational forces",
    "have been calculated for the full box whereas the hydrodynamical forces ( which are exclusively local ) were only computed in a sub - box of side length 26 mpc .",
    "these three sub - volumes have been analysed at redshift @xmath7 showing that we indeed obtain galaxy populations in agreement with low - redshift observations , as we had also previously shown in @xcite using the same approach yet smaller simulation boxes .",
    "halos in our simulations are identified by the openmp+mpi halo finder ` ahf ` @xcite as well as ` skid ` @xcite , and their respective results have been cross - compared to check for completeness .",
    "the halo scale of these objects is defined by the virial radius ( @xmath32 ) based upon the @xcite fitting function to determine the overdensity threshold .",
    "the so - called galactic scale has been based upon material ( stars ) inside a sphere of radius @xmath33 , a scale separating the baryon from the dark matter domination @xcite .",
    "this automated procedure has been tested by comparing with individually determined limiting stellar sizes of several hundred of objects based upon their 3d visualization as well as their 3d stellar density profiles .",
    "we further asked that our objects are not involved in violent events , either at the halo or at the galactic scale . to exclude this kind of objects at the halo scale",
    ", we have used the form factor , @xmath34 , defined via the virial relation @xmath35^{2 } { r_{\\rm e , h}^{\\rm tot}})$ ] , where @xmath36 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath37 the half - mass radius at the halo scale , and we asked it to be within the expected interval ( 1.9 , 2.5 ) for virialized objects @xcite and of the order of unity if we use @xmath32 instead of @xmath37 .",
    "the same procedure has been employed on the galactic object scale using  in analogy  the parameter @xmath38^{2 } { r_{\\rm e , bo}^{\\rm star}})$ ] .",
    "again , objects outside a certain range ( based upon a manually gauged subsample of 200 objects for each @xmath2 ) have been discarded . putting a mass threshold of @xmath39 , our final samples",
    "consists of 137 , 521 and 1315 galaxies at @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath5 , respectively , not involved in violent events at any scale .",
    "our first result is in fact the mere existence of these samples of high - redshift relaxed massive galaxies . to understand their origin ,",
    "we first quantify the correlation and inter - relation , respectively , between their mass ( @xmath42 and @xmath12 ) , size ( half - mass radii @xmath37 and @xmath14 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath36 and @xmath13 ) both at the halo and at the stellar scale using the following variables : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "we list the average values @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in table  [ tab : pca ] where we can observe a mild increase of @xmath52 alongside a decrease of @xmath53 while @xmath54 remains constant : as the universe expands , the objects become on average less and less compact due to the decrease of the global density @xcite .",
    "we basically observe the same phenomenon on the stellar scale , however , accompanied by a moderate increase in @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , the ratios @xmath56 and @xmath57 show an scaling behaviour as a function of either @xmath42 or @xmath12 ( see table 2 and below ) .",
    "going one step further , we search for planes in the ( @xmath58 ) space by performing a principal component analysis ( pca ) of all samples .",
    "it is made in 3d to circumvent projection effects @xcite .",
    "we have found that at all redshifts one of the eigenvalues of the pca is considerably smaller than the others , so that ( massive ) objects populate a flattened ellipsoid close to two - dimensional , both at the halo scale and at the stellar object scale : @xmath59 where @xmath60 refers to the scale of the object , i.e. halo or star . table  [ tab : pca ] also lists the values of the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 of these planes as well as their bootstrapping errors .",
    "we find that at the halo scale the planes are close to the virial plane ( vp , defined by @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) , as expected for well - defined haloes . at the stellar scale we also find planes to which we refer as the _ intrinsic dynamical planes ( idps ) _ and whose observed manifestation is the fundamental plane .    to better view the idp s , their relation to the vp and any possible evolution we plot them in figure  [ fig1 ] for @xmath40 ( green ) , @xmath41 ( red ) , and @xmath5 ( blue ) .",
    "points are the actual data for all the massive objects , shown in a projection where the @xmath5 data are edge - on .",
    "ellipses stand for the corresponding projections of the 1-sigma 3d ellipsoids ( full lines ) or 3-sigma ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "the centers of the ellipses are the corresponding projections of the ellipsoid centers .",
    "straight lines have the same directions as the major axes of the ellipses resulting from projections of the vps ellipsoids .",
    "two important results arise from this plot and table  [ tab : pca ] .",
    "first , high-@xmath2 massive galaxies are on idp s which are clearly tilted relative to the vp .",
    "second , we observe a mild evolution of the idp between @xmath40 and @xmath5 , primarily driven by changes in the average values @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and not the plane parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "to shed more light onto the tilt of the idp with respect to the vp , and following the discussion in @xmath70[s1:intro ] , we have first checked if there is a mass homology breaking , that is , if the parameter @xmath71 depends on @xmath12 .",
    "we have calculated its trend with stellar mass ( @xmath72 ) and listed the best fit @xmath73 in table  [ tab : directfits ] . within",
    "the error bars the correlation is consistent with zero .",
    "this means that stars accomodate the product of their spatial and velocity dispersion distributions ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) according to @xmath42 .",
    "second , we have checked whether the mass ratio @xmath10 correlates with @xmath12 . and",
    "in fact , we find that this ratio decreases for increasing stellar mass at any given @xmath2 ( cf . table  [ tab : directfits ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect the idp to be tilted against the vp ( as discussed in the introduction and explained in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we further compared our results against a simulation with different star formation parameters and found no difference concerning the idp tilt .    but how can we understand these trends with respect to scenarios of galaxy formation ? in order to answer this question we need to additionally consider the ratio of hot and cold baryon mass inside @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath75 ) as a function of the mass scale .",
    "first we note that mass assembly of the objects we analyze is dominated by cold accretion mode , in consistency with @xcite results with the entropy - conserving gadget-2 code .",
    "now , the best - fit parameters to the scaling relation @xmath76 are given in table  [ tab : directfits ] again .",
    "there we find that the fraction of hot over cold baryons increases very significantly as we go to higher masses .",
    "we can further acknowledge from table  [ tab : directfits ] that the overall baryon fraction @xmath77 does not depend on @xmath12 .",
    "both these results taken together imply that massive haloes have proportionally less cold gas available to be accreted from the halo and transformed into stars than less massive ones .",
    "this explains the trend of @xmath10 with the mass scale found above .",
    "further , it is worth noting that all the @xmath78 slopes in table  [ tab : directfits ] change from one @xmath2 to another only within their errors .",
    "now , why is more hot gas relative to cold gas enclosed within the virial radius as @xmath42 increases ? to answer to this question we have to recall how massive galaxies assemble their mass . very briefly , our simulations show that massive galaxies form from gaseous mass elements enclosed by overdense subvolumes within the simulation box .",
    "as predicted by the adhesion model @xcite we have found that gas is bi - phasic .",
    "indeed , at a given time a distinction can be made between singular gaseous mass elements ( as those that have already been involved in caustic , i.e. , singularity , formation at this time ) and regular ones ( those that have not yet been trapped into a caustic and tend to be of low density ) .",
    "we have also found that , from a global point of view , mass elements are dynamically organized as a hierarchy of _ flow convergence regions _ ( fcrs ) , that is , attraction basins for mass flows . at high @xmath2 fcrs undergo fast contractive deformations , that violently shrink them , transforming most of the cold , densest gaseous mass elements they contain into stars and heating the diffuse component there . due to its low density , this component , once heated tends to keep hot along evolution , and forms shock fronts that expand , in consistency with @xcite results .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more elaborate discussion .    in the simulations analyzed in this letter , we have witnessed events occurring along the fast phase of massive galaxy formation , see @xmath70[s1:intro ] : very fast mass assembly , dissipation and star formation rates ensuing fcr contractive deformations .",
    "these contractions act on dynamical timescales that are short because we have high overdensities where massive galaxies are about to form , therefore explaining the presence of massive objects in a young universe .",
    "additionally , such violent fcr contractions tend to swallow the mass close to them , severely limiting the amount of mass available to be further assembled after they occur .",
    "this would explain why a fraction of the objects we have identified are not dynamically disturbed .",
    "we have also seen in the simulations the gravitational gas heating due to these violent dynamical events , that partially transform the ordered mechanical energy involved in contractions into thermal energy and pressure .",
    "this is a crucial point for understanding the tilt of the idp s at high @xmath2 s . to be quantitative , recall for example that a system must get rid of an amount of energy equal to its binding energy as it collapses from infinity and virializes @xcite",
    "this binding energy per unit virial mass increases with halo mass as @xmath79 , so that at assembling a galaxy , the more massive it is the more energy per unit mass is available to heat and pressurize the gas at the corresponding fcr contraction . otherwise , as explained above , after these violent events most of the heated low density gas elements remain hot .",
    "this implies that more hot gas relative to cold gas is enclosed within @xmath32 as @xmath42 increases , as we have found .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the origin of the idps tilt relative to vps lies in that gravitational gas heating processes are more effective as the mass of the halo increases and that there is not mass homology breaking .",
    "finally , let us stress that the same physical processes act along the fast phase , as the slopes in table  [ tab : directfits ] do not change with zs .",
    "summing up , the processes involved in high-@xmath2 massive galaxy formation are : fcr contractions ( approximatively equivalent to collapse ) acting on a bi - phasic gas , induced by singularity formation in terms of the adhesion model approximation ; the ensuing transformation of the ordered mechanical energy of contraction into velocity dispersion , and then partially into thermal energy and gas pressure , on the same timescales ; and dense gas elements shrinkage , cooling and their transformation into stars .",
    "energy injection is unlikely to substantially change the processes responsible for this high @xmath2 fp tilt , because , as explained , they have to do with caustic ( i.e. singularity ) formation .",
    "we conclude that the violent processes described above are responsible for having : 1 ) massive objects at high redhisft , 2 ) hot gas coronae , 3 ) less cold gas to form stars as the mass scale increases , because we have more gas heated , implying idp s tilted relative to vp s , among other results .",
    "we see that the same processes are responsible for obtaining massive stellar objects shortly after the big bang as well as having them lying on idps : fast fcr contractions at different scales are the engine driving them .",
