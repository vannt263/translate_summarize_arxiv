    "we attempted spectroscopic observations of most tough host candidates with @xmath6mag that did not have a reported reliable redshift .",
    "a total of 19 candidates were spectroscopically observed for an aggregate of nearly 30hr with the aim of acquiring redshift information .",

    "four different grism setups were mainly used : 300v , 300v+gg375 , 600z+og590 , and 600ri+gg435 .",
    "we requested a seeing constraint of 12 for all observations apart from grb060923c for which 08 was required (  [ 060923c.sec ] ) .",

    "their sample is slightly smaller and , by construction , limited to gamma - ray bright events .",
    "the tough sample extends to fainter luminosities ( a factor of around six ) and as such is more suited to test the faint ( and potentially high - redshift ) end of the grb distribution .",
    "indeed , their mean ( median ) redshift is 1.84 ( 1.64 ) , significantly lower than for the whole tough sample .",
    "given the association of long grbs with the deaths of massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "both forms generally underpredict the rate of low - luminosity grbs ( as exemplified by grb980425 ) , suggesting that such bursts may form a separate population @xcite . in our homogeneous and unbiased tough sample ,",
    "only one event ( grb060218 ) is generally regarded as a member of this faint population , though we note this represents a rate of nearby bursts consistent with that predicted from the batse sample by @xcite . for the sake of clarity and simplicity , we restrict ourselves here to the exponentially cutoff single power - law form :    @xmath132    we assume that the grb rate follows the sfr history , and consider two different sfr history parameterizations which we label as follows . _ sfr1 _ is an update @xcite of the sfr history models of @xcite to include recent data from @xcite and @xcite , combined with a low - metallicity modification following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "_ sfr2 _ is model a from @xcite which represents a sfr history which remains constant beyond @xmath133 .",
    "it may , for example , be considered a more extreme low - metallicity correction to the cosmic sfr , or represent a correction @xcite to the high - redshift sfr as estimated from flux - limited surveys ( by the integration of galaxy lfs thus obtained ) due to a large amount of hidden star formation in faint , low - mass , and high specific sfr galaxies of the type that grbs tend to be associated with at lower redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "modeling is performed in the standard manner ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to produce @xmath134-@xmath135 number count distributions for various parameters of the lf , which are then fit by @xmath136 minimization to the observed @xmath134-@xmath135 distribution of all _ swift _ bursts with peak photon flux @xmath137 .",
    "we emphasize that the redshift distribution is not part of this fitting procedure , but is always purely a result . in fig .",
    "[ zdist.fig ] , we plot the redshift distributions from our best fitting models in comparison to the tough redshift data .",
    "the best fit model incorporating the _ sfr1 _ parameterization is a good fit to the number count distribution with a reduced @xmath138 ( 12 dof ) and has parameters @xmath139ergs@xmath8 and @xmath140 .",
    "the resultant redshift distribution is a good fit to the tough redshift distribution up to @xmath141 , but underpredicts bursts at higher redshift .",
    "overall , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test yields a @xmath1420.5% likelihood of the observed and model populations being the same .",
    "the _ sfr2 _",
    "parameterization is a slightly better fit to the number count distribution with a reduced @xmath143 ( 12 dof ) and lf parameters @xmath144ergs@xmath8 and @xmath145 .",
    "the resultant redshift distribution in this case is an improved match to the overall observed tough distribution with a ks likelihood of 42% .    at face value ,",
    "these results seem to imply that grbs follow a cosmic sfr history that is significantly enhanced at high redshift compared to estimates from flux - limited surveys . as previously discussed , given what is known about grb hosts , it is entirely feasible that grbs trace star formation at high redshift that would be undetectable by other means .",
    "it is of course also possible that the simple low - metallicity enhanced sfr parameterization used in the _ sfr1 _ model is inadequate , or that the lf could have a more complex form and/or evolve with redshift .",
    "an alternative approach to the modeling is to directly fit the observed joint peak - luminosity and redshift distribution of the sub - sample of tough grbs with redshifts .",
    "again we take both _",
    "sfr1 _ and _ sfr2 _ , but in this case a broken power - law lf .",
    "we take a threshold flux for detection by the burst alert telescope of @xmath146erg@xmath18s@xmath8 , and apply a @xmath147-correction based on the observed spectral parameters for each burst , to bring the luminosity to a fixed restframe bandpass ( 30300kev ) .",
    "the results are very similar to the conclusions obtained above ; hence we do not plot the inferred redshift distribution in fig .",
    "[ zdist.fig ] .",
    "however , we do note that for _ sfr2 _ the maximum - likelihood solution gives the following lf parameters :    @xmath148",
    "figure  [ zdist.fig ] shows the cumulative redshift distribution of the largest homogeneous and unbiased sample of grbs to date .",
    "it contains redshift information on all the 69 tough bursts , including limits .",
    "the conservative systematic error region ( hatched ) of the tough sample redshift distribution is significantly smaller than for previous samples ( e.g. figure  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "this allows the rejection of various model predictions ( e.g.  compare the dashed and dotted curves in fig .  [ zdist.fig ] ) .",
    "thus , we have been able to confirm previous findings ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the grb rate at high redshift ( @xmath149 ) appears to be in excess of predictions based on the assumption that it should follow conventional determinations of the star - formation history of the universe , combined with an estimate of its likely metallicity dependence @xcite .",
    "it is possible that star formation at high redshifts has been significantly underestimated .",
    "even at @xmath150 it appears that the galaxy lf has a substantially steeper faint - end slope than locally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while recent lf studies in the hubble ultra - deep field have concluded that at @xmath151 so - far undetected galaxies are likely to completely dominate the total star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this picture is supported by previous observations of damped ly@xmath5 absorbers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ly@xmath5 emitting galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as by recent simulation studies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it could be that grb production is substantially enhanced in the conditions of early star formation , beyond the metallicity - dependent rate correction already applied . in the long run",
    ", large complete samples of grb redshifts should shed light on whether the grb rate is proportional to sfr or whether other effects play an important role .    the sampling error and the conservative systematic error region",
    "are shown separately to clearly illustrate that incompleteness dominates the sample , and more is gained by reducing the systematics rather than increasing the sample size .",
    "using both error regions we can set a conservative limit on the maximum number of _ swift _ bursts at @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) : 14% ( 5% ) .",
    "this is fully consistent with the models which predict between 2 ( _ sfr1 _ ) and 13 ( _ sfr2 _ ) bursts per year ( all sky ) at @xmath152 to _ swift_/bat limits .    the average ( median )",
    "redshift of the 53 tough bursts is @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) , significantly lower than the early _ swift _ results indicated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this difference may simply reflect the comparatively small samples analyzed in that paper , but could also be due to an increased success in measuring redshifts @xmath155 using weaker absorption lines in afterglow spectra , and via host galaxies .",
    "the mean redshift could be as low as @xmath156 ( upper boundary of the hatched region ) although it is unlikely that the majority of bursts with unknown redshifts would be located at very small distances .",
    "in fact , it is more probable that @xmath157 since we have only targeted the brightest galaxies in the sample ( @xmath6mag ) for spectroscopic follow - up . in fig .",
    "[ zall.fig ] , we compare the tough redshift distribution to the one obtained from all long - duration _ swift _ bursts .",
    "the agreement is good in general but the tough sample includes relatively more bursts in the range @xmath158 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that ly@xmath5 is located in the blue end of the optical at this redshift range which makes it easy to miss a damped ly@xmath5 absorber . on the other hand ,",
    "emission lines are readily detectable with x - shooter at these redshifts .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , one of the tough selection criteria ( requiring the xrt error circle radius to be less than 2 ) might slightly bias our sample against faint , hence potentially high - redshift , bursts . in total",
    ", only two events were rejected due to a large error radius ( grbs050412 and 061102 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the x - ray afterglows were unusually faint , so this is an estimate of the fraction ( 2/71 ) of _ swift _ grbs that would fail the tough positional accuracy selection criterion which might well be at high redshift .",
    "further to this , a comparable bias is introduced by the exclusion of bursts without a detected x - ray afterglow at all ( 5/180).hr ) repointed . ]",
    "all five grbs are low - significance detections and are thus likely to be spurious . in total , a maximum of 5.5% of _ swift _ long bursts could be at high redshift and not enter the tough sample .",
    "we have now reached a point in grb research where a single burst rarely elucidates and illuminates our general understanding of the field .",
    "it is important to focus on well - defined samples and population studies , where systematics and biases can be minimized .",
