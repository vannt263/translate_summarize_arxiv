    "the continuously increasing huge amount of data and its simplicity have converted meson spectroscopy in an ideal system to learn about the properties of qcd . since gell - man conjecture , most of the meson experimental data were classified as @xmath4 states according to @xmath5 irreducible representations .",
    "nevertheless a number of interesting issues remains still open as for example the understanding of some data recently obtained on the b factories or the structure of the scalar mesons .",
    "the recently measured @xmath6 states are hardly accommodated in a pure @xmath3 description .",
    "they present a mass much lower than the naive prediction of constituent quark models . besides , the underlying structure of the scalar mesons is still not well established theoretically . in a pure @xmath4 scheme the light scalars could be identified with the isoscalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the isodoublet @xmath9 , and the isovector @xmath10 , constituting a @xmath11 flavor nonet .",
    "however such identification immediately faces difficulties to explain for example ( i ) the @xmath8 and @xmath10 mass degeneracy , ( ii ) why @xmath12 and @xmath13 have so a different mass ? , ( iii ) the similar branching ratios of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 decays which clearly indicates the existence of strange and nonstrange content in the @xmath8 .",
    "the theoretical tools to determine the properties of mesons are based to a large extent on phenomenological models .",
    "the study of charmonium and bottomonium made clear that heavy - quark systems are properly described by nonrelativistic potential models reflecting the dynamics expected from qcd @xcite .",
    "for heavy quarks to leading order in @xmath16 it has been demonstrated that the interaction can be derived from the theory @xcite .",
    "the light meson sector has been studied by means of constituent quark models , where quarks are dressed with a phenomenological mass and bound in a nonrelativistic potential , usually a harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "quite surprisingly a large number of properties of hadrons could be reproduced in this way @xcite . in this",
    "talk we present the meson spectra obtained by means of a chiral constituent quark model in a trial to interpret some of the still unclear experimental data in the light scalar and @xmath1 meson sectors .",
    "since the origin of the quark model hadrons have been considered to be built by constituent ( massive ) quarks .",
    "nowadays it is widely recognized that the constituent quark mass appears because of the spontaneous breaking of the original @xmath17 chiral symmetry at some momentum scale . in this domain",
    "a simple lagrangian invariant under the chiral transformation can be derived as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the pseudoscalar fields @xmath21 with i=1, ... ,4 , and @xmath22 is the constituent quark mass .",
    "an expression of the constituent quark mass can be obtained from the theory , but it also can be parametrized as @xmath23 with @xmath24 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 determines the scale at which chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "once a constituent quark mass is generated such particles have to interact through goldstone modes . whereas the lagrangian @xmath26 is not invariant under chiral rotations , the one of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is invariant since the rotation of the quark fields can be compensated renaming the bosons fields .",
    "@xmath27 can be expanded in terms of boson fields as , @xmath28 the first term generates the constituent quark mass and the second one gives rise to a one - boson exchange interaction between quarks .",
    "the main contribution of the third term comes from the two - pion exchange which will be simulated by means of the one - sigma exchange potential .",
    "based on the nonrelativistic reduction of the former lagrangian , one obtains an interaction between quarks mediated by the exchange of different goldstone bosons . among them , the one - pion , one - kaon and one - eta exchanges contribute with a central and a tensor interaction , while the one - sigma exchange gives a central and a spin - orbit term .",
    "explicit expressions of these potentials can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the goldstone boson exchange interaction are fixed assuming that @xmath11 flavor - symmetry is exact , only broken by the different mass of the strange quark . in the heavy quark sector ,",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and therefore these interactions will not appear .    for higher momentum transfer quarks still interact through gluon exchanges . following de rjula _",
    "@xcite the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) interaction is taken as a standard color fermi - breit potential . in order to obtain a unified description of light , strange and heavy mesons",
    "a running strong coupling constant has to be used @xcite .",
    "the perturbative expression for @xmath29 diverges when @xmath30 and therefore the coupling constant has to be frozen at low energies .",
    "we parametrize this behavior by means of an effective scale dependent strong coupling constant @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the reduced mass of the @xmath3 system and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are fitted parameters @xcite .",
    "this equation gives rise to @xmath36 for the light quark sector , a value consistent with the one used in the study of the nonstrange hadron phenomenology @xcite , and it also has an appropriate high @xmath37 behavior , @xmath38 at the @xmath39 mass @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 function appearing in the oge has to be regularized in order to avoid an unbound spectrum from below . taken into account that for a coulombic system the typical size scales with the reduced mass",
    ", we use a flavor - dependent regularization @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "moreover the schrdinger equation can not be solved numerically for potentials containing @xmath42 terms .",
    "this is why we regularize the noncentral terms of the oge with a monopole form factor with parameter @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the other nonperturbative property of qcd is confinement .",
    "lattice qcd studies show that @xmath4 systems are well reproduced at short distances by a linear potential that it is screened at large distances due to pair creation @xcite .",
    "one important question which has not been properly answered is the covariance property of confinement . while the spin - orbit splittings in heavy quark systems suggest a scalar confining potential @xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the dirac structure of confinement is of vector nature in the heavy quark limit of qcd . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant mixture of vector confinement has been used to explain the decay widths of @xmath44-wave @xmath1 mesons @xcite .",
    "such property being irrelevant for the central part of the interaction , determines the sign and strength of the spin - orbit thomas precession term .",
    "therefore , we write the spin - orbit contribution of the confining interaction as an arbitrary combination of scalar and vector terms @xmath45 where @xmath46 $ ] is the vector ( scalar ) spin - orbit contribution .",
    "with the quark - quark interaction described above we have solved the schrdinger equation for the different @xmath4 systems .",
    "let us briefly discuss the parameters of our model .",
    "most of the parameters of the goldstone boson fields are taken from the @xmath47 sector .",
    "the eta and kaon cutoff masses are related with the sigma and pion one as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath48 \\simeq \\lambda(ud)+m_{s}$ ] where @xmath49 is the strange quark current mass .",
    "the confinement parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 are fitted to reproduce the energy difference between the @xmath52 meson and its first radial excitation and the @xmath53 and the @xmath54 .",
    "the parameters involved in the oge are obtained from a global fit to the hyperfine splittings well established in the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "finally , one has to fix the relative strength of the scalar and vector confinement .",
    "using a pure scalar confining potential one obtains 1363 mev and 1142 mev for the @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , in complete disagreement with the order and magnitude of the experimental data . introducing a small mixture of vector confinement , @xmath57=0.777 , the experimental order",
    "is recovered , being now the masses 1198 mev and 1322 mev , respectively , both within the experimental error bars .",
    "this value also allows to obtain a good agreement with the experimental data in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 systems .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show results for the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons and for heavy mesons .",
    "the agreement with experimental data is remarkable .",
    "let us emphasize that with only 11 parameters we are able to describe more than 110 states @xcite .",
    "recently belle and babar collaborations have reported new experimental measurements that immediately prompted different interpretations .",
    "the belle collaboration has reported the following values for the mass of the @xmath60 @xmath62=\\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{c } 3654 \\pm 6 \\pm 8 \\text { mev ref .",
    "\\cite{bel1 } } \\\\   3622 \\pm 6 \\pm 6 \\text { mev ref .",
    "\\cite{bel2 } } \\\\ 3630 \\pm 8 \\text { mev ref .",
    "\\cite{bel3 } }   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] that are significantly larger than most predictions of constituent quark models and the previous experimental value of the pdg : @xmath63=3594 \\pm 5 $ ] mev .",
    "it has been pointed out that these values can not be easily explained in the framework of constituent quark models because the resulting @xmath64 hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) would be smaller than the predicted for the @xmath65 ones .",
    "in fact the predicted ratio of the @xmath64 to @xmath65 hfs in charmonium is @xmath66 whereas the experimental one is r=0.273 if @xmath63=$ ] 3654 mev , r=0.547 for 3622 mev , and r=0.479 for 3630 mev . in view of these differences",
    "some authors have claimed for an @xmath67 coupling constant depending on the radial excitation .",
    "our result is @xmath68=$ ] 3627 mev , within the error bar of the last two belle measurements , the ones obtained with higher statistics .",
    "moreover the ratio 2s to 1s hfs is found to be 0.537 , in perfect agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the reason for this agreement can be found in the shape of the confining potential that also influences the hfs , the linear confinement being not enough flexible to accommodate both excitations @xcite .",
    "the experimental measurement reported by babar is a narrow state near 2317 mev known as @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this state has been confirmed by cleo @xcite together with another possible resonance around 2460 mev .",
    "both experiments interpret these resonances as @xmath70 and @xmath71 states .",
    "this discovery has triggered a series of articles @xcite either supporting this interpretation or presenting alternative hypothesis .",
    "the most striking aspect of these two resonances is that their masses are much lower than expected .",
    "the mass difference between the pdg mass value @xmath72 and the lowest value of @xmath73 reported by the belle collaboration is about 135 mev . using these data and the pdg mass value for the @xmath74 one would expect the @xmath75 mass to be around 2400 mev , almost 100 mev greater than the measured values .",
    "our results are shown in table [ t2 ] .",
    "they agree reasonably well with the values of the pdg for both for the @xmath1 s and @xmath76 s states , but fail to reproduce the two @xmath76 states reported by belle and cleo .",
    "we also agree with the results by focus @xcite for the @xmath77 state but we are far from the result of belle for the same state .",
    "it is still not clear which are the members of the @xmath2 nonet corresponding to @xmath78 @xmath0 multiplets .",
    "there are too many 0@xmath79 mesons observed in the region below 2 gev to be explained as @xmath4 states .",
    "there have been reported in the pdg two isovectors @xmath80 : @xmath12 and @xmath81 ; five isoscalars @xmath82 : @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; and three @xmath85 : @xmath86 , @xmath87 and recently @xmath88 .",
    "the naive quark model predicts the existence of one isovector , two isoscalars and two @xmath89 states .",
    "our results are shown in table [ t1 ] . using this table one can try to assign physical states to @xmath2 nonet members .",
    "we observe that there are no nonstrange states with @xmath90 and mass close to 1 either 1.5 gev , which would correspond to the @xmath91 and the @xmath92 .",
    "the same occurs in the strange sector around 0.8 gev , we do not find a @xmath93 partner for the @xmath88 .",
    "let us discuss each state separately .",
    "with respect to the isovector states , there appears a candidate for the @xmath12 , the @xmath94 member of the lowest @xmath95 isovector multiplet .",
    "the other candidate , the @xmath81 , is predicted to be the scalar member of a @xmath95 excited isovector multiplet .",
    "this reinforces the predictions of the naive quark model , where the @xmath96 force makes lighter the @xmath97 states with respect to the @xmath98 .",
    "the assignment of the @xmath99 as the scalar member of the lowest @xmath95 multiplet would contradict this idea , because the @xmath100 is well established as a @xmath101 pair .",
    "the same behavior is evident in the @xmath58 and the @xmath102 spectra , making impossible to describe the @xmath81 as a member of the lowest @xmath95 isovector multiplet without spoiling the description of heavy - quark multiplets .",
    "however , in spite of the correct description of the mass of the @xmath12 , the model predicts a pure light - quark content , what seems to contradict some experimental evidences .",
    "the @xmath81 is predicted to be also a pure light quark structure obtaining a mass somewhat higher than the experiment .    in the case of the isoscalar states ,",
    "one finds a candidate for the @xmath13 with a mass of 402 mev , in the lower limit of the experimental error bar and with a strangeness content around @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath91 and @xmath92 can not be found for any combination of the parameters of the model .",
    "it seems that a different structure rather than a naive @xmath4 pair is needed to describe these states .",
    "the @xmath104 is a clear candidate for the lightest glueball @xcite and our results support this assumption . concerning the @xmath105 ( which may actually correspond to two different states @xcite ) we obtain two almost degenerate states around this energy , the lower one with a predominantly nonstrange content , and the other with a high @xmath106 content .",
    "finally a state corresponding to the @xmath84 is obtained .",
    "concerning the @xmath89 sector , as a consequence of the larger mass of the strange quark as compared to the light ones , our model always predicts a mass for the lowest @xmath2 state 200 mev greater than the @xmath12 mass .",
    "therefore , being the @xmath10 the member of the lowest isovector scalar multiplet , the @xmath88 can not be explained as a @xmath3 pair .",
    "we find a candidate for the @xmath107 although with a smaller mass .    in conclusion",
    "our results indicate that the light scalar sector can not be described in a pure @xmath4 scheme and more complicated structures or mixing with multiquark states seems to be needed .",
    "our conclusion concerning the @xmath91 and the @xmath88 are very similar to the ones obtained by umekawa @xcite using the extended nambu - jona - lasinio model in an improved ladder approximation of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "this fact seems to indicate that relativistic corrections would not improve the situation and the conclusions remain model independent .",
    "in the naive quark model , to construct a positive parity state requires a unit of angular momentum in a @xmath101 pair .",
    "apparently , this takes an energy around 1 gev since similar meson states ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) lie above 1.2 gev .",
    "however a more complicated structure , like @xmath110 , suggested twenty years ago by jaffe @xcite can couple to @xmath2 without orbital excitation and therefore could be a serious candidate to explain the structure of some light scalar mesons .    in this section",
    "we study tetraquark bound states , focusing our attention in those states with the quantum numbers of the scalar mesons .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation using a variational method where the spatial trial wave function is a linear combination of gaussians the technical details are given in ref .",
    "let us only mention that neglecting the exchange terms in the variational wave function is fully justified for the heavy - light tetraquarks but it may induce some corrections in the present study . due to the presence of the kaon - exchange there is a mixture among different configurations with the same isospin . in particular , in the isoscalar sector the configurations :",
    "@xmath111 $ ] , @xmath112 $ ] , and @xmath113 $ ] are mixed .",
    "the same happens in the isovector case for the configurations : @xmath111 $ ] , and @xmath112 $ ] , and in the @xmath89 case for the configurations : @xmath114 $ ] , and @xmath115 $ ] . in all cases @xmath116 stands for a @xmath117 or @xmath118 quark .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we present the lowest states for the three isospin sectors .",
    "the @xmath119 s show the results obtained within the model described in sect .",
    "as one can see , there appear two states , in the isoscalar and isovector sectors , with almost the same mass , although too high to be identified with the @xmath8 and @xmath10 . in the @xmath89 sector",
    ", there appears a candidate to be identified with the @xmath9 .",
    "it has been recently argued the possible importance of three - body forces arising from the confining interaction for those systems containing at least three quarks @xcite .",
    "we have performed a calculation including a three - body confining term as the one reported in ref .",
    "the strength of this interaction has been chosen to reproduce the mass of the @xmath8 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by @xmath120 s .",
    "as one can see the degeneracy between the isoscalar and isovector states remains , while the lowest state of the isoscalar and @xmath89 sectors are almost not affected . from these results",
    "one could inferred that the scalar sector needs the presence of tetraquark structures to be understood .    as a summary ,",
    "we have obtained candidates for all the light scalar mesons reported in the literature .",
    "our results suggest that there would be some states , as it is the case of the @xmath10 and @xmath7 that would be a mixture of a @xmath3 and tetraquark structure , but it definitively assigns a tetraquark structure to the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 .",
