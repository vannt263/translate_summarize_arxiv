    "<S> we review the theoretical status of the models including the multinucleon emission channel in the calculation of quasielastic neutrino cross sections at miniboone kinematics . </S>",

    "<S> _    the miniboone collaboration has recently measured the neutrino charged current ( cc ) quasielastic ( qe ) cross section on @xmath0c for a neutrino beam with average energy of @xmath1 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of these results with a prediction based on the relativistic fermi gas model using the standard value of the axial cut - off mass @xmath2 gev@xmath3 reveals a substantial discrepancy . in the same model the larger value of @xmath4 gev@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> is needed to account for data . for nuclear physicists accustomed to the complexity of the nuclear system , </S>",
    "<S> this anomaly is likely to reflect the many - body aspect of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> indeed martini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ have pointed out @xcite that , depending on the detection method , certain types of inelastic events can simulate quasielastic ones . as the miniboone experimental set - up defines a `` quasielastic '' event as one in which only a muon is detected , the ejection of a single nucleon ( a genuine quasielastic event ) is only one possibility , and one must in addition consider events involving a correlated nucleon pair from which the partner nucleon is also ejected . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the excitation of 2 particle-2 hole ( 2p-2h ) states ; 3p-3h excitations are also possible . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion in the quasielastic cross section of events in which several nucleons are ejected , leads to an excess over the genuine quasielastic value . </S>",
    "<S> martini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ have argued that this is the likely explanation of the anomaly showing that their evaluation can account for the excess in the cross section without any modification of the axial mass . </S>",
    "<S> after this suggestion , a number of articles have discussed the problem of multinucleon emission and whether it could account for the anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to review the actual theoretical status on this subject .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical studies of 2p-2h in connection with ccqe at miniboone kinematics are actually performed essentially by three groups . </S>",
    "<S> there are the works of martini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the ones of amaro _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite and the ones of nieves _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently it appears also a paper of bodek _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite considering a more phenomenological approach related to electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> two - nucleon emission via two - body currents is not a new idea related to neutrino - nucleus interaction , it was studied since the eighties in connection to the electron scattering , photon and pion absorption . </S>",
    "<S> it is for example well known that the absorption of pions by nuclei is a two - nucleon mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> concerning electron scattering , several theoretical calculations have shown that 2p-2h are needed to reproduce the inclusive cross section . </S>",
    "<S> in particular they contribute to fill the so called `` dip '' region between the quasielastic and the delta peaks . </S>",
    "<S> they affect the isospin spin - transverse ( i.e. the magnetic ) response . </S>",
    "<S> an exhaustive bibliography on these studies is beyond the purposes of this work . in the following we just mention the sources and the references of the calculations of the three groups mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the np - nh contributions in the papers of martini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> are obtained starting from the microscopic calculations of pion absorption at threshold @xcite , of pion and photon absorption @xcite and of the transverse response in electron scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they give two different parametrization of this np - nh contribution ( which leads to practically identical neutrino total `` quasielastic '' cross section ) , one more relates to @xcite , the other to @xcite . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we present the results just obtained with this second parametrization which is characterized by a more satisfactory energy and momentum transfer dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> the 2p-2h contributions considered by amaro _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ are taken from the full relativistic model of @xcite related to the electromagnetic responses . the work of nieves _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ can be considered as a generalization of @xcite , developed for the electron scattering , to the neutrino scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions related to the @xmath5-mec excitations are taken , as in the case of martini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ from @xcite . considering these three different models </S>",
    "<S> , it exists some differences already of level of genuine qe which can be particularly important when one compares the double differential cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> amaro _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> considered the relativistic superscaling approach based on the superscaling behavior exhibited by electron scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> the models of martini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ and nieves _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> are more similar : they start from a local fermi gas picture of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> they consider medium polarization and collective effects through the random phase approximation ( rpa ) including @xmath5-hole degrees of freedom , @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson exchange and @xmath8 landau - migdal parameters in the effective @xmath9 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of nieves _ et al . _ is relativistic while the original one of martini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ was non relativistic . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been improved through relativistic corrections @xcite . concerning the 2p-2h sector </S>",
    "<S> we remind that there exist several contributions to two - body currents , see for example @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are the so called pion - in - flight term , the contact term and the @xmath5-intermediate state or @xmath5-mec term . at level of terminology </S>",
    "<S> , some authors refer just to the first two terms as meson exchange currents contributions , like in @xcite , but actually the most current convention consists into include the @xmath5-term into mec . in order to preserve the gauge invariance of the theory also the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlation contributions </S>",
    "<S> must be taken into account . in an infinite system </S>",
    "<S> they give rise to divergences . </S>",
    "<S> the different prescriptions to regularize them lead to a model dependence of the results . in this connection amaro _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ consider only the mec contributions and not the correlations and the correlations - mec interference terms . </S>",

    "<S> the agreement with the total `` qe '' cross section improves , at least at high neutrino energy , adding to the genuine qe in the susa approach the mec contribution . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the shape of this cross section is somewhat different with respect to the other calculations , maybe owing to the absence of nn correlations contributions . </S>",

    "<S> the effect of np - nh as compared to one nucleon ejection should be somewhat less important for antineutrino because the spin isospin response which is affected by the 2p-2h piece has less weight for antineutrino owing to the negative axial - vector interference . </S>",

    "<S> the absence of nn correlation contributions might be responsible for residual disagreement . </S>",
    "<S> a treatment of these contributions performed by the same group in the electron scattering sector @xcite seems to suggest that they are of the same order of magnitude as the one of 2p-2h mec and that they are supposed to have a greater impact for large neutrino - muon angles . </S>",
