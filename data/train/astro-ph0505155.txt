    "the so - called `` proplyds '' , or protoplanetary disks , and candidate proplyds have been found in the orion nebula ( e.g. , laques & vidal 1979 ; garay et al .",

    "the trifid nebula is a well - known hii region that is estimated to be @xmath1 years old and star formation has taken place at the edge of the region within the last @xmath2 years ( cernicharo et al 1998 ; lefloch and cernicharo 2000 ; hester et al .",
    "it therefore presents us with an opportunity to examine proplyds at an stage of their exposure to the ionizing flux as well as to investigate the type of stars that proplyds can be associated with .",

    "1985 ; see also kohoutek et al .",
    "1999 ) and is centered on a small cluster of hot stars dominated by components a through g of hd 164492 .",
    "the ionizing flux required to maintain the hii region , @xmath4 s@xmath5 , is supplied by the o7.5iii star hd 164492a ( e.g. , walborn 1973 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",

    "radio and infrared studies of the central region of m20 have suggested the presence of circumstellar disks in the vicinity of hd 164492a . in one study ,",

    "wfpc2 observations ( 9104 ) of m20 were completed in june 2002 in order to make a mosaic image of this nebula , to study proper motion of hh 399 jet in the southeast region of the nebula and to search for proplyds in the central region of the nebula .",
    "proper motion study of hh 399 was recently described by yusef - zadeh , biretta and wardle ( 2004 ) .",

    "a detailed account of the large scale mosaic image will be given elsewhere .",
    "here , we concentrate on observations of the central region of the nebula which contains a cluster of stars and a bright ionized rim known to be embedded within the hii region .    to study the center of m20 , a sequence of short and long exposures of the central cluster with two different orientations separated by 160@xmath11 were carried out in h@xmath0 ( f656n , 4@xmath12 s , 4@xmath13 s , 2@xmath14 s ) , [ sii ] ( f673n , 2@xmath15 s ) , [ oiii ] ( f502n , 4@xmath16 s , 4@xmath17 s , 2@xmath18 s ) , f547 m ( 2@xmath19 s ) , [ nii ] ( f658 , 4@xmath16 s , 4@xmath17 s ) and [ oi ] ( f631 , 2@xmath20 s , 4@xmath21 s ) .",
    "we used a range of exposure times to insure non - saturated images for the brighter stars , and used dithering to improve psf sampling and subtractions .",

    "a 1.4 - 2.5  @xmath10 m spectrum of the central star of hst1 , as labeled in figure 1 , was obtained at the united kingdom 3.8 m infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on the night of 2004 aug 29 ( ut ) , using the facility spectrograph uist ( ramsay howat et al .",
    "the 0.24  slit of uist was oriented north - south and observations were made in the standard stare / nod mode .",
    "the total exposure time was 4 minutes .",
    "hipparcos 86814 ( f6v ) was used for rough flux calibration and removal of telluric absorption lines .",

    "the five bright cluster members hd 164492a to e stars at the center of the nebula are labeled in figure 1 .",
    "two stars called hst1 and hst2 are located about 16.86@xmath9 and 9@xmath9 to the southwest of hd 164492a at @xmath22 .",
    "hst1 shows extended h@xmath0 and [ sii ] line emission centered at @xmath23 .",
    "a faint extended emission is also detected from hst2 centered at @xmath24 but the reality of the extended component needs to be confirmed .",
    "geometrical distortion has been removed before the h@xmath0 positions of these stars were measured , and the absolute and relative positions of these stars are accurate to within 0.5@xmath9 and 0.01@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "figures 2a , b show contour and grayscale representations of a close - up h@xmath0 view of hst1 , respectively .",
    "the morphology of the extended emission is reminiscent of proplyds noted in m42 where a crescent - shaped structure is pointing toward the central bright star hd 164492a .",
    "the proplyd structure coincides within 0.22@xmath25 and 0.34@xmath9 in right ascension and declination of a variable star centered at @xmath26 v3791 with its brightness varying between 12.9 and 15.1 magnitudes ( kholopov 1998 ) .",
    "the integrated h@xmath0 and [ sii ] fluxes from the proplyd are estimated to be 4@xmath27 and 2.2@xmath28 erg s@xmath5 @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "these estimates are made after the contribution from the central star and the background emission have been subtracted , but before any correction for extinction has been made . in order to investigate the reality of the extended emission and a dark ring associated with hst1 , a brighter field star was selected in the vicinity of the central cluster .",
    "the comparison of the field star with hst1 showed that the number of counts from the crescent structure is three times higher than the brightness of the diffracted ring detected from the field star .",
    "we also measured the number of counts from the dark ring associated with hst1 and compared it with the background emission .",
    "we found the the brightness of the dark ring is about 2 counts pixel@xmath30 lower than expected from the diffraction of starlight and the background .",
    "the same crescent structure was noted in two different exposures with different orientations as described above .",
    "these measurements suggest strongly that both the crescent structure and the dark ring surrounding hst1 are real .",
    "the outermost and innermost radii of the crescent structure are 0.36@xmath9 and 0.22@xmath9 whereas the innermost radius of the dark ring is @xmath31 .    in order to identify the spectral type of the central star hst1 , ukirt observation of this star",
    "was carried out .",
    "figure 3 shows the 2.0 - 2.5  @xmath10 m portion of the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum has been smoothed to a resolving power of @xmath32600 .",
    "the br  @xmath33 line in the calibration star was removed prior to ratioing ; thus the br  @xmath33 absorption line in hst1 is real ; it is the only clearly identified feature in the spectrum .",
    "its strength , the presence of weaker brackett series lines in the h portion of the spectrum , and the lack of co overtone band absorption at 2.3  @xmath10 m and longward suggest that the star s spectral type is late f - mid g. thus , it is unlikely that the central star hst1 contributes a significant fraction of the ionizing radiation for the proplyd .    in spite of the short pc1 exposures ,",
    "hd 164492b , c and d stars were too bright to bring out any faint extended emission arising from these stars .",
    "however , we noted that both stars c and d show multiple components .",
    "the c star showed two bright peaks in h@xmath0 , [ ni ] and [ oiii ] images separated by 0.1@xmath9 whereas the d star shows two bight peaks in h@xmath0 separated by 0.1@xmath9 , one of which had an [ oiii ] counterpart .",
    "the high - resolution images suggest that hd 164492b , c and d stars are binaries .    based on hst and ukirt observations",
    ", we assume that hst1 has a protoplanetary disk that is being heated and ionized by the fuv ( 6 ev @xmath34 ev ) and euv ( @xmath35 ev ) radiation from hd 164492a . assuming a projected distance of 2.8@xmath36 au ( 16.9@xmath9 at the distance of 1.68 kpc ) between the central star and v3791 , the lyman continuum flux j@xmath37 is estimated to be 2.8@xmath38 photons @xmath29 s@xmath5 .",
    "the morphology of the proplyd shows that the radius of the ionization front r@xmath39 is subtending an angular distance of of 0.2@xmath9 or @xmath40 . the total lyman continuum flux intercepted at the radius of the ionization front",
    "is expected to be @xmath41 ph s@xmath5 assuming that there is no visual extinction between the ionizing source and the proplyd .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 flux is estimated to be 1.5@xmath42 ph s@xmath5 assuming a@xmath6=1.3 magnitudes along the line of sight to the trifid .",
    "a number of factors may contribute to a discrepancy of a factor of 15 between the expected flux intercepted by the protoplanetary disk and the extinction corrected h@xmath0 flux .",
    "the discrepancy could be partly due to the differential extinction toward the central star and the proplyd .",
    "alternatively , this discrepancy could be due to a significant number of recombinations in the gas between the proplyd and the ionizing star .",
    "considering that the proplyd lies in the bath of radiation and is closer to the ionization front of the hii region , it is plausible that the incident ionizing flux is different than that resulting from the r@xmath30 geometrical dilution .    using the emission measure e ( @xmath43 pc ) = 4.9 @xmath44 l",
    "( see bally and reipurth 2001 ) , the electron density n@xmath45 ) at the ionization front can be estimated from the observed h@xmath0 intensity i@xmath46 ergs s@xmath47 .",
    "assuming that l is the radius of the cusp @xmath48 pc or 504 au ( 0.3  at the distance of 1.68 kpc ) , n@xmath49 @xmath50 after accounting for the extinction between us and m20 . given this emission measure ,",
    "the estimated radio continuum flux density is estimated to be @xmath51 0.1 mjy at 8ghz assuming the temperature of 8000 @xmath11k and the conversion factor used by brandner et al .",
    "the total mass of ionized gas is estimated to be m@xmath52 where the mean molecular weight per electron @xmath10 is assumed to be 1.4 @xmath53 . estimating the expansion time to be @xmath54 years , the mass - loss rate is estimated to be @xmath55 .",
    "evidence for the support of photoevaporative process being at work on a large scale comes from the striking distribution of the ionized gas @xmath56 away from hd 164492a .",
    "figure 4 shows an hst mosaic image of the central region of m20 .",
    "the mosaic image is constructed by combining h@xmath0 , [ sii ] and [ oiii ] line images .",
    "two bright ionized rims to the north and southeast delineate the surface of molecular condensations facing the central cluster .",
    "the so - called molecular consdensation tc1 ( the nomenclature used by cernicharo et al .",
    "1998 ) to the north is the closest protostellar condensation to the central cluster in m20 .",
    "figure 5a , b show a close - up view of the head of tc1 with a cometary morphology .",
    "a remarkable complex of elongated structures parallel and perpendicular to the ionized rim is best noted in h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] line images .",
    "these features have no [ sii ] counterparts .",
    "the elongated structures extend up to 12@xmath9 or @xmath320.1 pc , some of which appears to show a helical structure in projection and some sheet - like appearance .",
    "the lack of [ sii ] line emission from the filaments away from the ionized rim may be the result of an ionization stratification noted in the photoionized photoevaporative flow as seen in the hst image of m16 ( e.g. , hester et al . 1996 ) . unlike the photoevaporative flows streaming normal to the surface of the dark cloud toward the ionizing star ,",
    "the features noted in figures 4 and 5 make a large angle with respect to normal to the surface of the molecular condensation .",
    "the evidence for the existence of protoplanetary disks at the center of m20 being illuminated by a bright o7.5 star hd 164492a comes from a number of direct and indirect measurements .",
    "the most conclusive evidence comes from the optical morphology of h@xmath0 and [ sii ] line emission arising from a crescent - shape structure with its cusp pointing toward hd 164492a star .",
    "the proplyd coincides with a late f ",
    "mid g spectral type and an infrared source irs 3 which shows evidence of warm dust emission from the protoplanetary disk . the physical size or the cusp radius of the proplyd",
    "is @xmath57 cm which is larger than the typical size of the proplyds found in the orion nebula .",
    "radio continuum , near - ir and mid - ir measurements suggest dense material in the form of protoplanetary disks being photoevaporated by hd 164492a .",
    "these stars include a massive star hd 164492c or irs 1 and an intermediate mass star hd 164492d or irs 2 .",
    "the evidence of proplyd from irs 3 provides indirect support for the hypotheses that the disks of these massive stars irs 1 and irs 2 are also photoevaporated by hd 164492a but because of their high stellar brightness , their corresponding proplyds were not detected .",
    "one of the key questions is whether or not proplyds survive sufficiently long for planet formation to occur ( churchwell et al .",
    "1987 , henney & odell 1999 ) . to examine the properties of the proplyd in m20",
    ", we estimate the lifetime of the neutral disk using the column density n(hi ) @xmath58 estimated from mid - ir observations ( lefloch et al .",
    "these authors derive a typical column density of hydrogen for the cool component of the dust emission from irs 1 , 2 and 3 , all of which show similar spectral characteristics .",
    "if we assume that this cool column of gas comes from a disk of radius r@xmath59 or 235 au , the total mass of the disk m@xmath60 .",
    "the mass of cold neutral material is estimated to be similar to the mass of ionized gas , thus the emission is argued to be originating from the photon - dominated region pdr of a reservoir of dense circumstellar material exposed to the ionizing radiation of hd 164492a ( yusef - zadeh 2000 ; lefloch 2001 ) .",
    "the lifetime of the pdr in the proplyd associated with irs 3 is estimated to be roughly 500 years . however , this timescale is clearly underestimated since the column density of molecular gas is unknown .",
    "additional evidence for the support of photoevaporative process being at work on a large scale comes from the distribution of a bright rim seen @xmath61 away from hd 164492a .",
    "the bright ionized rim delineates the surface of a molecular condensation ( tc1 ) facing the central cluster .",
    "figures 4 , 5 show a remarkable extended structure projected against the surface of the ionized rim as best noted in h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] lines .",
    "this shock - like filamentary structures with size scale of about 0.1 pc are detected only at the edge of the ionization front where the incident radiation from hd 164492a in non - normal to the surface of the molecular condensation .",
    "we speculate that the origin of such a structure could be due to a number of proplyd outflows distributed in the vicinity of tc1 .",
    "the nature of several stars projected against the filamentary structure needs further investigation to determine their relationship to the filamentary structure . in this picture",
    "the proplyd outflows could be shocked by their interaction with each other and/or with the stellar wind from hd 164492a .",
    "similar processes are known to take place in the orion nebula ( e.g. , garcia - arrendono , henny & arthur 2001 ; henney 2002 ; graham et al .",
    "other effects that could contribute to the production of filamentary [ oiii ] structure at such curious location with respect to the central hd 164492a star is the onset of instability of the ionization front .",
    "recent numerical work suggests that the ionization front can become unstable when the source of radiation makes an inclined angle with respect to the surface of tc1 ( e.g. , williams 2002 ) . obviously , more detailed work is necessary to understnad the nature of these diffuse ionzied features .",
    "acknowledgments : we wish to thank r. odell and mark wardle who were co - investigators on the hst proposal under which these observations were carried out .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee , william henney whose comments improved the manuscript . in particular , his suggestions to account for the origin of the large - scale diffuse features in the vicinity of the protostellar condensation were extremely helpful .",
