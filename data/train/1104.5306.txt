    "the twin ( and apparently disjoint ) topics of quantum phase transition ( qpt ) and quantum dissipation ( qd ) have seen a great upsurge of activity in recent years .",
    "the qpt is of significance in many areas of contemporary interest in the condensed matter , such as metal - insulator transition , quantum magnetism , ferroelectricity , superconductivity and in the general question of coherence and quantum computation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "qd is ubiquitously present because of environmental influences on otherwise unitary evolution of quantum systems@xcite .",
    "dissipation , though considered a pest , needs to be understood ( and tamed ) , in order to tackle decoherence effects in quantum many body systems .",
    "our aim in this paper is to analyze the combined presence of these two seemingly disparate phenomena of qpt and qd via simple model systems .",
    "our hope is to elucidate on the irreversible effects near a quantum critical point(qcp ) because of dissipative interactions with the environment .",
    "the simplest model of a qpt is an ising system of coupled spins ( which are taken to be polarized in one direction only , say the z - axis ) , subjected to an additional ( magnetic ) field @xmath0 along , say the x - axis .",
    "the latter couples to the x - component of the spins which , because of its non - commutativity with the z - component , triggers quantum dynamics in the system . the resultant transverse ising model ( tim) is a prototype for analyzing the conflicting presence of order along z - axis induced by the ising coupling and ` disorder ' , caused by the tilting of the spins to the x - axis by @xmath0 .",
    "the net result is the occurrence of a qcp at temperature @xmath1 in the @xmath2 phase diagram as @xmath0 is increased to a critical value @xmath3 , when the system transits from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase ( see fig.1)@xcite",
    ". we will be interested in analyzing questions such as what is the analogue of ` phase ordering ' in classical systems ( see @xcite ) when the quantum mechanical system of fig.1 is subjected to a sudden quenching along the @xmath0-axis across @xmath4 , maintaining the temperature at @xmath1 . because a change in the value of @xmath0 ( from above @xmath4 to below ) will inevitably lead to an irreversible transition from one equilibrium configuration to another",
    ", dissipation needs to be dovetailed to the discussion .",
    "again , a straightforward and widely studied model of quantum dissipation , popularized in recent years by ford et al @xcite , and caldeira and leggett@xcite , is the one in which the quantum system at hand is linearly coupled to a bosonic bath .",
    "tim is an effective model which has application from solid state materials of rare earth magnets to a coupled josephson arrays@xcite , where dissipation arises in a natural way .",
    "our model hamiltonian can then be written , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total number of spins and @xmath7 is a coupling constant .",
    "when @xmath8 and the ising coupling @xmath9 is treated in the mean field approximation(mfa ) , we obtain the phase diagram , depicted in fig.1 .",
    "several limiting cases of eq([ham - ising ] ) have received attention in recent literature . if @xmath10 and the term @xmath11 in the coupling with the heat bath is replaced by @xmath12 , eq([ham - ising ] )",
    "yields the celebrated spin - boson model of quantum dissipation @xcite .",
    "when the ising interaction is replaced by a zeeman coupling with an external field @xmath13 on a single ( @xmath14 ) spin , the model in eq([ham - ising ] ) describes low - temperature dissipative quantum tunneling in an asymmetric double well @xcite .",
    "additionally , if @xmath15 , one has a symmetric double - well , tunneling in which can be impeded , leading to localization , when the coupling with the bosonic bath exceeds a certain critical value@xcite .",
    "this case is also relevant for a kondo impurity of spin one - half ( described by @xmath16 ) , in interaction with a conduction electron bath , which can be modeled in terms of bosons as far as the electron - hole excitations near the fermi surface are concerned@xcite . for @xmath17",
    ", this model can be viewed as an generalization of the dicke model of ` superradiance ' where the ising term includes an additional atom - atom interaction@xcite .",
    "one other important application of eq([ham - ising ] ) ensues in the case wherein the range of the ising interaction is infinite , i.e , @xmath18 a constant .",
    "this situation is the one in which the mfa to the ising model ( in the absence of the transverse field @xmath0 ) becomes exact and will occupy much of our attention below . writing the total spin components as @xmath19 we have from eq([ham - ising ] ) and eq([coupling ] ) , @xmath20 if we leave aside the coupling term @xmath7 , the spin - hamiltonian in eq([ham - largespin ] ) represents a ` molecular magnet ' characterized by a single - ion anisotropy energy @xmath21 , and subjected further to a transverse field @xmath0@xcite .",
    "this problem has been investigated in great detail in recent years in the context of macroscopic magnetization tunneling when the value of @xmath22 can be pretty large such as @xmath23 .",
    "the additional coupling to the bosonic bath when @xmath7 is switched on , enables us to treat the effect of dissipation on this tunneling behavior@xcite .",
    "the preceding remarks then underscore the versatility and relevance of the model hamiltonian @xmath24 in eq([ham - ising ] ) in a variety of applications to current topics in the condensed matter . in the sequel we shall analyze diverse mean - field and low - temerature properties of @xmath24 , keeping the underlying qpt in mind . with this background to the formalisms developed here ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section",
    "ii we first carry out a unitary transformation on the hamiltonian in eq([ham - ising ] ) , that has been borrowed from the literature on polaron - physics@xcite .",
    "this transformation enables the original coupling constant @xmath7(proportional to a variational parameter @xmath25 ) to be elevated to an exponential function , thus facilitating an analysis that works even in the regime of strong coupling to the bath .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian , rewritten in terms of @xmath25 , is then treated in section iii in the mfa to evaluate the associated density matrix from which the helmholtz free - energy and an equation of state for the magnetization can be calculated . in section",
    "iv we focus our attention to spin wave like excitations near the absolute zero of temerature .",
