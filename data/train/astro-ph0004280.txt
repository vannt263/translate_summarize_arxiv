    "pulse charge ( adc ) and timing ( tdc ) information for each tube is recorded for each event .",

    "4 .   the tube must not have an outlying relative gain value .",
    "tubes with relative gains outside the range 1.0@xmath280.3 contribute significantly to trigger differences across the camera face .",
    "this factor is particularly important when comparing regions over the entire camera face .",
    "the telescope is an altitude - azimuth type , which introduces a rotation of the camera relative to the sky about the tracking position during data collection .",

    "the camera is divided into groups of eight tubes which share common high voltage and other circuitry , and a special cut , _ box _ ( yoshikoshi @xcite ) , is designed to remove images arising from electronic contamination , and are concentrated in only one or two tube boxes , this _ box _ cut , in combination with a total adc sum ( _ adc _ ) cut rejecting events with fewer than 200 adc counts , is very effective at removing such artifacts .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the _ box _ cut does not reduce the power of the image cuts , and that the optimum _ adc _ cut lies at @xmath25200 adc counts .",
    "mirror degradation resulted in an event rate drop by about a factor of two from 1994 to 1995 , indicating a higher energy threshold for the 1995 dataset .",

    "the most interesting question concerns the possibly of enhanced tev gamma - ray emission from regions of high ism density ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , where there is a greater chance for the interaction of cosmic rays from the snr .",
    "the molecular clouds along the northeast and northern remnant boundary have been mapped in detail by arikawa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) at the co j=1 - 0 and j=3 - 2 lines .",
    "the shocked ( region undergone passage and compression by the snr shock ) component of the clouds is distributed along the snr / clouds boundary , has a mean density of @xmath79 @xmath16 , and mass @xmath80m@xmath81 .",
    "the other 4@xmath82m@xmath81 of the unshocked gas has a density of @xmath83@xmath16 and is displaced radially outward from the shocked gas by @xmath251 arcmin .",
    "clearly , any tev gamma - ray flux from @xmath6 decay would be dominated by the shocked gas regions , given that the unshocked regions of the cloud would have a much lower density and lower energy available for cr production , and the mean matter density for regions excluding the molecular cloud is only @xmath251.3 @xmath16 ( esposito et al .",
    "arikawa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) has derived the energy deposited into the shocked gas at @xmath84ergs , a value consistent with the rho et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimate for the total snr energy when considering the volume filling factor @xmath85 , between the clouds and the snr .",
    "@xmath85 is simplistically estimated at @xmath86 , by taking the mass and density of the shocked gas ( given above ) , assuming the cloud consists of h@xmath87 , and a value of 10pc for the snr radius .",
    "we also assume that @xmath2510% of the available snr energy goes into cosmic ray production , a reasonable value for a sedov - phase snr , and also consistent with the measured energetics for the snr and clouds .",
    "thus we adopt values of 3@xmath88ergs for @xmath76 , and @xmath89 @xmath16 for @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxscaling ] ) .",
    "a working band on our flux prediction is obtained if we assume a range of values for @xmath53 from 1.8 to 3.3 kpc , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : egret_naito_w28 ] , we compare the model predictions based on the above scalings to our upper limit obtained from an extended source of radius 0.25@xmath2 encompassing the clouds from 1994 data ( the highest of our upper limits ) .",
    "the flux from 2eg j1801@xmath02312 ( essentially the same as 3eg j1800@xmath02338 ) and its straight extrapolation to tev energies is also included as any @xmath6 gamma - ray flux will be limited by the egret measurement .",
    "our upper limit lies an order of magnitude below the straight extrapolation of the flux from egret ( dashed line of fig  [ fig : egret_naito_w28 ] ) , and is able to place some constraint on the prediction of a @xmath6 gamma - ray flux from the shocked gas region . in order to accommodate our upper limit however a cutoff and/or slighter steeper parent spectrum than -2.1 appears necessary . in assuming an exponential cutoff at 100 tev for the parent spectrum of accelerated hadrons",
    ", we assume that w28 follows the standard picture of particle acceleration in snr , with particle energies limited by radiative losses , finite age of the shock and particle escape .",
    "when the cutoff for electrons is due only to radiative losses however , it can be expected that the hadron spectrum will continue ( reynolds & keohane @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the long - established knee at @xmath90 ev in the all - particle cosmic ray spectrum there is now direct experimental evidence pointing to a continuation of the proton / helium spectra up to at least @xmath91 tev ( asakimori et al .",
    "@xcite ) , implying that strong cutoffs may not be required .",
    "our result here is consistent however , with previous comparisons of upper limits ( from other snrs ) to hadron - induced gamma - ray models ( e.g. buckley et al .",
    "@xcite , allen et al .",
    "@xcite and prosch et al .",
    "@xcite ) which seem to require some cutoff below the knee energy / and or spectra steeper than -2.1 .",
    "further constraints may arise if electronic components are considered .",
    "particularly , electronic bremsstrahlung may dominate over the inverse compton component due to the very high density of target matter in the clouds .    the above discussion aside , the location of 3eg j1800@xmath02338 by itself , makes it s interpretation difficult in terms of simple cr - matter interaction , or as the result of a pulsar - powered process ( proposed by merck et al .",
    "many of the promising sites within w28 for gamma - ray production are now outside the 95% error circle , leaving just the filled x - ray centre , and southern / western portions of the radio shell . at best , we are in a position to rule out the interpretation of the egret source as resulting totally from @xmath6 decay gamma - rays with an unlimited parent spectrum , and to place limits on the parent spectral index / cutoff energy combination .",
    "a search for tev gamma - ray emission from the southern snr w28 was carried out by the cangaroo over two observation seasons ( 1994 and 1995 ) using the atmospheric erenkov imaging technique .",
    "an analysis providing a consistent gamma - ray acceptance and quality factor for extended sources was used .",
    "a number of sites within a search region of @xmath92 were considered as potential point - like and diffuse sources of tev gamma - ray emission .",
    "no evidence was found for the emission of tev gamma - rays at any of these sites which include those from the strongest two masers , an egret source , a radio pulsar ( all as point sources ) and a diffuse region containing the molecular clouds that appear to be interacting with the remnant .",
    "our 3@xmath14 upper limit from this diffuse region at 6.64@xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath5 @xmath93 tev , and the flux of the egret source 3eg j1800@xmath02338 were compared with gamma - ray flux predictions from the model of naito and takahara ( @xcite ) . under this framework , our upper limit rules out a straight extrapolation of the egret flux to tev energies .",
    "it also constrains somewhat the flux expected from the shocked region of gas in the molecular cloud , placing limits on the parent spectra for hadrons and/or cutoff energy .",
    "our results suggest that the egret source probably does not result entirely of @xmath6 gamma - rays .",
    "this fact is supported by it s location in relation to the molecular clouds . in a later paper",
    ", we will consider electronic bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering and discuss the broader implications of our results in relation to the origin of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "further data on w28 will no doubt be taken with the recently completed cangaroo ii telescope ( yoshikoshi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which , at the very least will provide tighter constraints on models of gamma - ray production for this interesting source .",
