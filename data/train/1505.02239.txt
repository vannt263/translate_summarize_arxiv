    "<S> nuclear energy released by splitting uranium and thorium isotopes into two , three , four , up to eight fragments with nearly equal size are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the energy released from equally splitting the @xmath0u and @xmath1th nuclei into to three fragments is largest . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical multifragmentation model is employed to calculate the probability of different breakup channels for the excited nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> weighing the the probability distributions of fragments multiplicity at different excitation energies for the @xmath2u nucleus , we found that an excitation energy between 1.2 and 2 mev / u is optimal for the @xmath3u , @xmath2u , @xmath4th and @xmath5th nuclei to release nuclear energy of about 0.7 - 0.75 mev / u .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear energy is one of the most efficient sources of energy based on the einstein s mass - energy equivalence formula ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it originates in the strong force holding the protons and neutrons together . </S>",
    "<S> the release of nuclear energy happens when nucleons rearrange themselves to form more stable nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in such nuclear reaction processes , a large amount of energy is released in the form of emitted kinetic energy of particles or fragments and electromagnetic radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> there are three ways to release nuclear energy , known as radioactive decay@xcite , fusion @xcite and fission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the radioactive decay is the spontaneous process which occurs in radioactive materials by which the nuclei of unstable parent nuclei , gradually break up and are transformed into more stable isotopes or into nuclei of a different type . </S>",
    "<S> the daughter nuclei , consequently lose energy by emitting radiation in the form of particles ( include @xmath7 , @xmath8 , photons , neutrons particle etc . ) and/or electromagnetic waves . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous fusion reaction happens in the core of stars including our sun . </S>",
    "<S> however in order to harness it to produce power , the fusion process must be controlled . nuclear energy from fusion </S>",
    "<S> is still far from commercially viable even though controllable fusion reaction has been studied for many years through the means of magnetic confinement @xcite and inertial confinement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fission technology has been widely used to generate power by neutron - induced chain reactions . </S>",
    "<S> this fission process occurs when a heavy nucleus such as @xmath3u and @xmath9pu absorbs a thermal neutron and the excited compound nucleus is excited to be near its fission barrier . at low excitation energy , quantum effects in the fission process </S>",
    "<S> are very significant to the dynamical evolution of the system . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear structure effects , such as the shell corrections , directly influence the fission barrier height and the fission path . </S>",
    "<S> most fission modes induced by thermal neutron are binary fissions in which one daughter nucleus has a mass of about 90 to 100 u and the remaining nucleus 130 to 140 u. occasionally ternary fission and quaternary fission occur with relatively probability of 1/300 and 1/3000 per binary fission , respectively @xcite . for each binary event of uranium nucleus </S>",
    "<S> , about 0.1 percent of the mass of the parent nucleus appears as the fission energy which is about 0.85 mev per nucleon . for the nucleus with high excitation energies , </S>",
    "<S> the multifragmentation characterized by the multiple production of intermediate mass fragments is the typical decay mechanisms which is quite different from that at low excitation energies . </S>",
    "<S> it is not yet clear how much energy will be released in the multifragmentation process .    to describe the breakup process of excited nucleus </S>",
    "<S> , statistical models have been proposed , such as the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) , the statistical evaporation model ( hivap ) @xcite and the statistical model ( gemini ) @xcite , among others @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the smm used to describe the breakup of excited nuclei in this work has been successfully applied to describe intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite and spallation reactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic assumption is that , after the most violent stages of the reaction , the source at thermal equilibrium with mass number @xmath10 , charge number @xmath11 , and excitation energy @xmath12 will expand and desintegrate almost simultaneously into a number of small and intermediate mass fragments . for a given excitation energy @xmath12 , especially for highly excited nuclei , </S>",
    "<S> a large number of breakup channels are open . </S>",
    "<S> the different breakup channels are generated by monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of each breakup channel is normally formulated in terms of a statistical partition function @xmath13 which is related to the total energy and the helmholtz free energy through the standard thermodynamic expression . </S>",
    "<S> the relative probability for a breakup channel can be written as @xmath14 . and the average value of a physical observable @xmath15 should be calculated through @xmath16 . for more detailed description of the smm </S>",
    "<S> see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the aftermath of the nuclear reaction , </S>",
    "<S> if the total mass of the final system is lower than the initial mass , the loss in mass which is called mass defect is converted into a large amount of energy given by ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of total binding energy before and after the reactions is defined as :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 denotes the binding energy of @xmath19-th nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> the specific binding energy ( binding energy per nucleon ) reflects the interactions of the nucleons inside the nucleus , especially the short range nuclear force and the long range coulomb forces . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the experimental specific binding energy for 2438 nuclei from the mass table ame2012 published in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20fe is the strongest bound nucleus and the nuclei with mass number around 56 have the largest specific binding energy values which is approximately 8.79 mev / u . in general , for lighter nuclei with mass number less than 56 , the nuclear force which is short range and attractive , </S>",
    "<S> has not reached saturation . except for very light nuclei with increasing mass number , </S>",
    "<S> the average number of nucleons around one nucleon increases gradually , therefore , the specific binding energy also increases gradually . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coulomb force , which is proportional to @xmath21 , is long range and repulsive and become more important with heavier nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the specific binding energy for heavy nuclei decreases gradually with increasing of mass number .    in massive stars , </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear energy in a contracting core can be released through the neon , oxygen and silicon burning processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> complete exhaustion of the nuclear fuel in the stellar nucleosynthesis process happens when final production of the stable isotope @xmath20fe is formed . in a typical fission process , such as the reaction of n+@xmath3u@xmath22ba+@xmath23kr+3n , the total energy released is about 0.85 mev / u which including 0.70 mev / u and 0.15 mev / u corresponds to the energy released in the fission process and decay process of prefragments @xmath24ba and @xmath23kr , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since the mass number of @xmath24ba and @xmath23kr are much larger than that @xmath20fe , the energy released in this fission process is incomplete . </S>",
    "<S> more nuclear energy can be released if such heavy nucleus can split into three or more fragments . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the nuclear energy released for the three - fragments case . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , the decay process of unstable nuclei is not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we split a source with mass number @xmath25 into three fragments @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29where , @xmath30 and each data point a is plotted in a dalitz - type plot . for each set of fragments , </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear energy released by the source is calculated by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) with mass table ame2012 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) is a triangular dalitz - type plot for @xmath2u . in a triangular dalitz - type plot </S>",
    "<S> one can represent each event with fragments mass numbers @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 by a point placed at distances from three sides of the equilateral triangle . </S>",
    "<S> a point located at the corner , on the side and inside the triangle , corresponds to an event with one , two , and three fragments , respectively . in the central region of dalitz - type plot </S>",
    "<S> , the energy emitted by @xmath2u is 0.95 mev / u as compared to 0.7@xmath310.8 mev / u released from splitting @xmath2u into two equal size fragments . </S>",
    "<S> if a heavy source such as @xmath2u splits equally into three fragments , the mass number of each fragments is about 80 . to bring the fragments closer to @xmath20fe , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to split it into four fragments .    </S>",
    "<S> similar to the ternary fragment case , we represent four fragment events with fragments mass numbers @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath32 by a point placed at distances from four surface of the tetrahedron . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ) denotes one of the four surface of the tetrahedron . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) shows a slice of tetrahedron s dalitz plot calculated with the mass table ame2012 with @xmath34 for @xmath2u . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , one can see that 0.80 mev / u is released if the @xmath2u nucleus is splitted into four equal fragments . this is lower than 0.95 mev / u obtained by splitting the nucleus into three equal fragments , despite the mass number of each of the four fragments be about 60 which is closer to 56 . </S>",
    "<S> the fragments splitted from source @xmath2u have larger neutron - proton ratio , the specific binding energy of these fragments is very small as the symmetry energy term plays an important role in nuclear binding energy .    fig . 3 compares the average energy released per nucleon obtained with the mass table ame2012 for splitting @xmath3u , @xmath2u , @xmath4th and @xmath5th into two , three , four , five , six , seven , and eight fragments with nearly equal size . </S>",
    "<S> nearly equal energy is released in the case of the two , four , and five fragments , which is about 0.8 mev / u . </S>",
    "<S> the energy released from three fragments case is larger than in the other cases . </S>",
    "<S> although splitting it into three fragments with nearly equal size is the most efficient way of releasing nuclear energy , the probability of ternary fission for the heavy nucleus at low excitation energies is very small . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to increase the excitation energy of the source to study the nuclear energy released in the multifragmentation process . </S>",
    "<S> however the multifragmentation process for highly excited nuclei is very complex , as a large number of decay channels are simultaneously open @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we employ statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) which is a classical statistical model to calculate the probability of different decay channels for the excited nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 shows the probability as a function of the fragment multiplicity for@xmath2u sources with excitation energy @xmath351 , 2 , 3 and 4 mev / u . </S>",
    "<S> we select events whose multiplicity values lie between 2 - 10 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that many breakup channel are simultaneously open for a given excitation energy . for @xmath36 mev / u , </S>",
    "<S> the probability are approximately 0.6 for binary events and 0.4 for ternary events . as the excitation energy increases , decay channels with larger multiplicities are opened gradually and the position of the maximum probability is moves to higher multiplicity values .    in the framework of smm , </S>",
    "<S> the average energy released is obtained by averaging this quantity in each fragmentaion mode @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the nuclear energy release in the @xmath19-@xmath39 event and @xmath40 is corresponding statistical weight . </S>",
    "<S> the average nuclear energy released per nucleon for the @xmath3u , @xmath2u , @xmath4th , and @xmath5th at different excitation energies are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . as is well known , for a heavy nuclei with low excitation energy , one observes the emission of light particles plus an evaporation residue in the deexcitation process . </S>",
    "<S> fission occurs usually when the excited energy is larger than the fission barrier of the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> multifragmentation often happens in highly excited nuclei . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 one can see that at @xmath351 mev / u , the average nuclear energy release rises up to 0.7 mev / u , as one varies the source nucleus , due to the opening of the binary breakup channel . </S>",
    "<S> between 1.2 and 2 mev / u , the probability of binary , ternary and quaternary breakup channel accounts for the largest proportion of the emitted fragments , and peaks around 0.7@xmath310.75 mev / u . </S>",
    "<S> however as the excitation energy surpasses 2 mev / u , the breakup channels with higher multiplicities dominates the partition function . </S>",
    "<S> the average energy released per nucleon gradually decreases with the increasing of the excitation energy .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , the nuclear energy released has been calculated by splitting @xmath3u , @xmath2u , @xmath4th and @xmath5th sources into two , three , four , five , six , seven , and eight fragments with nearly equal size . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation results demonstrate that fragmentation into three nearly equal fragments is the most efficient mechanism to release the nuclear energy . </S>",
    "<S> we found that 0.95 mev per nucleon is released in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical multifragmentation model has been employed to simulate the breakup process of excitation nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the probability distributions of fragments multiplicity at different excitation energies we find that an excitation energy between 1.2 and 2 mev / u is optimal for the @xmath3u , @xmath2u , @xmath4th and @xmath5th nuclei to release nuclear energy . </S>"
