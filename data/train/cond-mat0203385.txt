    "among the various types of incommensurate systems one of the simplest kind ( the so - called uniaxial composite crystal ) is constructed from two sets of regular inter - penetrating incommensurate chains .",
    "the recurrent interest for these systems is related mainly with the experimental activity on several classes of intergrowth compounds which can be viewed as good physical realizations of the uniaxial composite crystal .",
    "there is a considerable literature ( mainly theoretical but not only ) discussing eigenmodes and related properties of composite systems ( see e.g. the review article @xcite and references therein , and the more recent papers quoted in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although a number of sophisticated calculations have been published over the last 20 years @xcite , there is still a clear need for a simple ( but yet non - trivial ) theoretical model with predictions which can be directly tested experimentally . in previous models all branches of excitations",
    "were simultaneously examined @xcite , and many subtle details of the composite systems were discussed in connection with higher order commensurability effects @xcite , such as the hierarchical nature of gaps arising at commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the results of these investigations , even in the long wavelength limit , are expressed in terms of many unknown parameters , and lead to many different modes , while experimentally it is not clear whether it is possible at all to observe these modes and to determine these parameters .",
    "furthermore , although the basic theory of excitations in incommensurate and composite systems was born long ago @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , many questions of principle remain unsettled , and there is an impressive quantity of unexplained , partially explained or contradictory results . in part",
    "this frustrating situation is just due to the lack of a simple and tractable analytical model .",
    "our motivation for adding one more paper to the topic is precisely to propose such a model .",
    "we do not intend to discuss in the present paper any of the dynamical details connected with the description of discontinuity edges in the vibrational density of states nor do we deal with the many structural properties ( see e.g. @xcite ) related to commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions .",
    "our aim is much more modest and based on the fact that many robust and experimentally testable features of the excitation spectra are not sensitive to the more delicate aspects of commensurability effects .",
    "note that one can consider composite structures as a new state of matter like liquid or solid states .",
    "composite structures differ from modulated crystals insofar as one can not define an average periodic structure for the full system . unlike crystals with incommensurate density waves that are characterized by weak deviations of atoms relative to their regular positions and unlike the adsorption structures with the rigid host and flexible guest sublattices , both subsystems in composites are more or less equivalent and",
    "therefore one can not treat them perturbatively as an external potential acting on its elastic counterpart , nor can one use the classical frenkel - kontorova model @xcite to describe phase diagrams and excitations .",
    "note that composite incommensurate crystals are also different from quasicrystals . according to the traditional classification",
    "@xcite quasicrystals refer to systems where the rotational symmetry corresponds to a forbidden crystal symmetry , which determines the unique ratio of incommensurate length scales that defines the structure , whereas for incommensurate crystals the rotational symmetry corresponds to an allowed crystal symmetry and many different sets of incommensurate length scales are possible .    due to the existence of ( at least ) two length scales , there are twice as many hydrodynamic variables as in conventional crystals .",
    "however in quasicrystals these additional variables can not be interpreted as real displacements of any of the sublattices , and this distinction leads to specific physical consequences .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the physics of composites is the dynamics of their sublattices . in order to formulate the problem ,",
    "let us consider first two inter - penetrating atomic chains with periods @xmath0 and @xmath1 and assume no coupling between them .",
    "then , two independent sets of incommensurate ( in @xmath2-space ) phonon branches with dispersions @xmath3 and @xmath4 should be observed ( fig.[twobranch ] ) . what happens with them , when the inter - chain interaction is properly taken into account ?",
    "different types of coupling are responsible for different effects .     and @xmath1.,width=226 ]    _ the elastic coupling _ results in the renormalization of the sound velocities @xcite .",
    "it leads to repulsion of the crossing branches with formation of intermediate gaps .",
    "the umklapp intersection of branches occurs however for _ any _ @xmath2 since , because of the period incommensurability , the condition @xmath5 can always be satisfied when the integers @xmath6 are chosen properly .",
    "hence a rich hierarchical set of gaps in phonon spectra is expected ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some general features related to breaking of analyticity due to static elastic couplings in the 1d double - chain model were reported recently in @xcite .    _",
    "the electrostatic coupling _ takes place when the chains @xmath0 and @xmath7 are charged .",
    "it leads to nonlocal renormalization of the phonon self - energy , nontrivial retardation effects , and to the plasmon gap formation @xcite , @xcite @xcite .    _",
    "the dynamical dissipative coupling _ originates from the internal friction between the chains . to our knowledge",
    "the dissipative dynamics of composites was studied only by the authors in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in the papers @xcite",
    "the authors have taken into account dynamic resonance processes arising due to the existence of degeneracy points of the subsystem modes which allow the interchange of energy and momentum .",
    "they described these processes by including into the response matrix a finite ( in the limit @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) off - diagonal contribution . for a strictly harmonic lattice",
    "the contribution vanishes identically .",
    "we propose below a microscopic realization of the dissipative dynamical coupling which is always present in real systems even in harmonic approximation .",
    "as it concerns to the paper @xcite the authors took into consideration all possible types of couplings and all degrees of freedom of composite systems , and therefore it is difficult to survey their results ( and all the more to compare the results with experimental data ) because of the large number of hydrodynamic variables involved .",
    "meanwhile the broadening and renormalization of phonon spectra due to the inter - chain friction can easily hide the subtle hierarchical gap structure as well as other minute effects , like the fluctuation - driven destruction of the 1d composite long - range order @xcite or the static and dynamic lock - in effects @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present publication to provide a simple and tractable model that incorporates the dissipative dynamic coupling in composite systems to calculate the experimentally testable features of the excitation spectra .",
    "we put forward a model of a composite system , which can be used to find the eigenmode spectrum ( under relatively weak assumptions ) , and to compute the dynamical structure factor .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate a model description of a composite incommensurate crystal which includes all the basic dynamical equations . in sections iii and iv the calculations of the eigenmodes and dynamical structure factors",
    "are presented .",
    "section v is devoted to a discussion and summary of our main results .",
    "the appendix deals with a very schematic description of a particular microscopic model of a uniaxial composite system .",
    "the simplest composite crystal consists of alternating chains with incommensurate periods @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are located in the @xmath10 plane and are directed along axes parallel to @xmath11 at @xmath12 and at @xmath13 . in this case",
    "even the basic structure is not commensurate .",
    "because of the local differences in environment the @xmath0 chain is modulated with period @xmath1 , and the @xmath1 chain - with period @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the atomic positions can be given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a certain natural offset of one set of chains with respect to its counterpart , @xmath16 are the displacements of the atoms about their average equilibrium positions , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are modulation functions .",
    "in fact just the definitions ( [ ckl1 ] ) allow us to introduce all the degrees of freedom relevant for our model of a composite system ( including therefore - the main branches of excitations ) .",
    "if we neglect for a moment the interchain interaction ( purely hypothetically since in the absence of subsystem @xmath1 subsystem @xmath0 would be generally unstable ) , we get evidently two zero - energy modes for the two chains , each one implying a rigid displacement of one chain with respect to its fixed counterpart .",
    "interchain interactions introduce new ingredients in this scheme . in the incommensurate state",
    "the position of the centre of mass of the atoms relative to the modulation potential can be described by a phase variable . in a rigid chain approximation",
    "the acoustic phonon mode corresponds to a global rigid displacement of the two sets of chains , while the phase mode corresponds to relative rigid displacements of the two chains in opposite directions such that the centre of mass of the composite crystal remains fixed . in a commensurate state",
    "this phase variable is pinned , thus there is one acoustical mode and one optical mode with a gap whose magnitude is determined by the pinning potential and strongly decays with the order of commensurability . in the latter case",
    "our consideration will be still valid for characteristic frequencies higher than the gap .",
    "considering the relative displacements to be rigid means that we neglect the above mentioned intermodulation .",
    "the interchain interaction moves the atoms on both chains away from their regularly distributed positions .",
    "however if the modulation functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are differentiable , then the atomic displacements corresponding to the phase mode are given by the following  dressed ",
    "displacements @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 denote a derivative over the argument .",
    "in order to discuss the long - wavelength , low - frequency excitations one should transform the discrete variables introduced above into continuous ones . for sound modes which consist of equal shifts of @xmath24 and @xmath25 this transformation is evident .",
    "namely in a continuum approximation the discrete variables @xmath26 are substituted by continuous functions @xmath27 .",
    "however it is not the case for the phase mode which consists of inhomogeneous ( on a microscopic scale ) atomic displacements ( corresponding to sliding of one chain system with respect to the other ) .",
    "however when the modulation functions @xmath28 are analytic , one can still use the long - wavelength description but for dressed displacements @xmath29 .",
    "for the benefit of the more skeptical reader the question concerning  dressed ",
    "variables should be clarified in more detail .",
    "in fact the dressed displacements @xmath29 depend on the displacements @xmath30 and @xmath31 as initially defined according to ( [ ckl1 ] ) ( since the modulation functions depend on the difference @xmath32 ) . for weak enough interactions and far enough away from commensurability , the modulation functions @xmath33 are continuous analytic functions and the energy of the system remains unchanged when the phase @xmath32 is varied .",
    "however a uniform shift @xmath32 does not indicate a uniform displacement of the atoms in both chains , since the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not constants .",
    "thus strictly speaking we should write down equations of motion separately for dressed and undressed variables . in our phenomenological approach",
    "it means a certain renormalization of all phenomenological constants entering the equations . in what follows",
    "we neglect the renormalization and will use @xmath27 for both ( acoustical and phase ) modes . in spite of this erroneous assumption ( which is equivalent to @xmath34 ) the approximation correctly identifies the important modes and characteristic scales in the problem .",
    "this sin of omission can be easily corrected when detailed information concerning the values of the parameters becomes available .",
    "the elastic energy can be written as a quadratic form of the strain tensor @xmath35 : @xmath36 the inter - chain interaction is given by the relative displacements along @xmath37 ( the 2nd term in ( [ ckl2 ] ) ) and also by the cross terms in the elasticity tensor @xmath38 .",
    "at the same time the free energy expansion ( [ ckl2 ] ) is invariant with respect to the relative shift of the chains along @xmath11 because of the incommensurability of the two periods , therefore there is no terms depending explicitely on @xmath39 ( only on gradients of the displacements , i.e. on @xmath40 ) .    as a note of caution",
    "we should remark here that there is a fundamental difference between the both kind of soft degrees of freedom in ( [ ckl2 ] ) , i.e. between acoustic and phase modes .",
    "the first one is a true goldstone mode , because it breaks the continuous translational symmetry ( and therefore remains hydrodynamic and gapless even if the modulation functions are not continuous ) .",
    "but the latter is a pseudo - goldstone mode and it loses its hydrodynamic character in the case of discontinuous modulation functions ( since phase variable breaks only countable translational symmetry ) .    to complete the derivation of the dynamical equations we have to know not only the elastic energy ( [ ckl2 ] ) but also the dissipative function @xmath41 . the internal friction produced by the sliding displacement of the chains results in a dynamical inter - chain coupling proportional to the chain velocity difference @xmath42 that contributes to the dissipation function : @xmath43 the second term in ( [ ckl3 ] ) corresponds to the viscous dissipation , and the coefficients @xmath44 entering ( [ ckl3 ] ) have the standard meaning of viscosity tensor elements @xcite .",
    "one new phenomenological coefficient @xmath45 describes a friction proportional to the velocity difference between the two chains .",
    "a few comments to assign physical meanings to the terms in equation ( [ ckl3 ] ) may be helpful to the reader .",
    "the first term in ( [ ckl3 ] ) is the energy dissipation caused by relative motion between the two set of chains . in the framework of our purely phenomenological",
    "approach we are not in a position to determine a dominant microscopic mechanism for the dissipation . a natural estimate for the order of magnitude of the friction coefficient @xmath45 ( based on the assumption that the work produced by the drag force density is completely dissipated in a viscous media ) is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the characteristic viscosity .",
    "it is worth noting that dynamic dissipative , static elastic and lock - in interchain interactions can differ both quantitatively , since there is no simple relation between the coupling coefficients @xmath45 , @xmath48 , and the elastic moduli , and qualitatively , because unlike static interactions , the dynamic dissipative coupling does not necessarily produces intermodulations of the two subsystems .",
    "now we are in a position to write down the equations of motion @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the matrix of densities .",
    "( [ newton ] ) is the second newton law where the forces acting on the component @xmath0 are : ( i ) the friction between the components due to their relative motion , and ( ii ) the elastic forces .",
    "as it is well known @xcite the propagation of elastic waves in anisotropic media is a rather complicated phenomenon .",
    "the directions of polarization and the eigen - frequencies are determined by the dispersion equation which is derived for the monochromatic solutions of ( [ newton ] ) . in a general anisotropic case",
    "however none of the polarization directions correspond either purely longitudinal or purely transverse directions with respect to the direction of the wave vector .",
    "we can look for solutions of the solution of the equations of motion ( [ newton ] ) in the form @xmath51 the dispersion @xmath52 can be found by substitution of ( [ wave ] ) into ( [ newton ] ) and , then , by diagonalization of the corresponding dynamical equations : @xmath53 the four degrees of freedom of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) correspond to the four propagating eigenmodes .",
    "we are interesting in the case when the excited wave is propagating along @xmath57 ( other geometries will be shortly discussed in the conclusion ) .",
    "then , the equation of motion ( [ newton ] ) can be split into a transverse part for @xmath58 and a longitudinal part for @xmath59 . in the transverse case , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ newton ] ) results in the decoupling of the excitations into sound and optical modes .",
    "thus for the polarization perpendicular to the chains we will find the usual optical and acoustical branches . less trivial is the longitudinal case when the last term in eq .",
    "( [ newton ] ) vanishes and the dynamical mode coupling @xmath60 provides the most important contribution to the properties of the propagating excitations . in the next section we consider this case in detail .",
    "the dynamical equation for the longitudinal eigenmode with @xmath61 looks like @xmath62 with    @xmath63    the terms with @xmath45 and @xmath64 provide the dynamical dissipative and elastic coupling between two sound waves propagating in chains @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to pick out the effect of this coupling on the phonon dispersions we neglect the intrinsic phonon attenuation that is given by terms with @xmath47 .    to find the eigenmodes one should solve the characteristic equation : @xmath65=0 \\label{char } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where :    @xmath66    * at small * @xmath2 ( @xmath67 ) the dynamical dissipative coupling substantially renormalizes the dispersions of the two sound modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the first two branches correspond to the time - conjugated sound - like modes @xmath68 with effective velocity and damping : @xmath69 ^{2}}{\\gamma _ { a}c_{b}^{2}+\\gamma _ { b}c_{a}^{2}-2\\left ( \\gamma _ { a}\\gamma _ { b}\\right ) ^{1/2}c_{i}^{2}}.   \\notag\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the third mode corresponds to the over - damped phason - like mode with pure imaginary dispersion ( diffusive mode ) : @xmath70 where the damping factor is given by :    @xmath71    in addition there is a purely relaxational fourth mode : @xmath72 which , however , is hidden by the third mode that relaxes much more slowly .",
    "* at high * @xmath2 : ( @xmath73 ) the elastic coupling leads to the effective renormalization of the velocities of the sound modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of the dynamical ( dissipative ) coupling is manifested by a specific @xmath2 -independent sound attenuation .",
    "the dispersion of these two time - conjugated sound modes reads : @xmath74 the renormalized velocities and attenuation factor are given by :    @xmath75    @xmath76    where the elastic coupling parameter @xmath77 : @xmath78 is larger than one ( weak coupling ) and smaller than @xmath79 ( stability condition ) .    at higher @xmath2 the intrinsic phonon attenuation @xmath80",
    "is superimposed onto the dynamical attenuation @xmath81 , a situation which can lead to a nontrivial @xmath2-dependence of the phonon line - width .",
    "of course it is possible to find the eigenmodes ( at least no problem at all to find the dispersion laws numerically ) in the general case of arbitrary @xmath2 taking into account all phenomenological parameters entering ( [ matr ] ) .",
    "however aiming for a simple model we have chosen the simplest coupling form for the displacement components on both chains , following the principle of minimal requirements . to keep our model tractable ( but yet non - trivial ) and to avoid tedious calculations we drop the intra - mode coupling @xmath82 that does not change the qualitative picture .",
    "as will be discussed further , the intrinsic phonon attenuation expressed by @xmath83 can be also neglected in the low energy region which is relevant to this discussion .",
    "although actually this picture is not entirely correct it correctly identifies the important modes and characteristic scales in the problem .    as a note of caution",
    "we should also keep in mind that there are four types of interactions involved , namely :    * the elastic interaction proportional to gradients of the displacements , and related to off - diagonal terms of the elasticity tensor ; * locking interaction , proportional to sublattice displacement differences ( the last term in ( [ newton ] ) with the coefficient @xmath48 ) ; * two dissipative couplings described by the off - diagonal terms of the viscosity tensor and by the mutual friction coefficient @xmath45 in ( [ newton ] ) .    the most robust phenomena are related to the dissipative couplings which we have taken into account in the derivation of the dispersion laws ( [ x ] - [ x3 ] ) .",
    "however the locking and elastic couplings could lead to appreciable effects , like e.g. a gap at @xmath84 for the sliding mode .",
    "the above discussed distinctive features of the excitation spectrum should be observable in different kinds of scattering experiments : ultrasonic measurements , brillouin light scattering and inelastic coherent scattering of neutrons or x - rays .",
    "the double - differential cross - section gives the probability that say a neutron with initial energy @xmath85 is scattered ( coherently or incoherently ) into a detector subtending a solid angle @xmath86 around a certain direction with spherical coordinates @xmath87 and @xmath88 , with a final energy @xmath89 .",
    "we note @xmath90 , ( @xmath91 is the energy transfer ) , and @xmath92 is the momentum transfer , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 , are the incoming and outgoing neutron momenta .",
    "the scattered intensity is proportional to the differential cross section for inelastic scattering :    @xmath95    where angular brackets denote a thermal average , @xmath96 are the coherent atomic scattering factors i.e. differential cross sections of light , sound , neutrons or x - rays for single atoms of chains @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the integrand in ( [ f ] ) is called the dynamical structure factor @xmath97 which is accessible by scattering techniques , and obeys the so - called detailed balance condition @xmath98 if the sample is in thermal equilibrium .    according to the fluctuation dissipation theorem @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the imaginary part of the generalized susceptibility .",
    "calculations of @xmath100 is a formidable task that can be done only on the basis of an appropriate microscopic model ( see e.g. the appendix to our paper ) . in a general case",
    "the dynamic susceptibility @xmath101 is a matrix with respect to the displacement fields of the two chains and to the respective cartesian components . owing to the lack of discrete translational invariance in the @xmath11 - direction it is non - diagonal also in the wave vectors . since the full investigation of 2d ( all the more 3d ) problem requires an extraordinary amounts of computational work we must defer the investigation of the full problem to the time when experimental results suitable for a quantitative comparison become available ( see also the conclusion section of the paper ) , and present here only the results for the wave vector parallel to the incommensurate direction ( @xmath11 - axis ) .    in the case of longitudinal phonons it can be written in the following form ( we dropped here unessential factors , since we are not interested in the absolute value of @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) : @xmath104 to study the structure factor we need to know the equilibrium positions of the atoms , the amplitude of oscillations , and the dispersion relation .",
    "thus the generalized susceptibility @xmath105 , which is the response function , is proportional to the inverse dynamical matrix @xmath106    we discuss here the cases when the momentum transfer @xmath107 ( parallel to the @xmath11 -axis ) lies close to the bragg peaks of the composite crystal @xmath108 with @xmath109 where @xmath110 are integer numbers .",
    "expression ( [ cur ] ) implies that each observed bragg peak can be classified as follows : main reflections of the @xmath0 subsystem ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) ; main reflections of the @xmath1 subsystem ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) ; common reflections to @xmath0 and @xmath1 subsystems ( @xmath113 , @xmath112 ) ; pure satellite reflections ( @xmath111 , @xmath115 ) . with regard to the general program we do not have the ambition to find the dynamical structure factor in the whole region of parameters .",
    "in fact such a general formulation would not be tractable and in any case it would have little meaning in view of the qualitative nature of our model .",
    "for this reason and only for illustration purposes we consider a few particular cases .",
    "consider first the forward scattering when the momentum transfer @xmath116 is small ( acoustic case ) .",
    "this regime corresponds to brillouin ( light and x - ray ) scattering . on the basis of ( [ sq ] ) the structure factor @xmath117",
    "is reduced to ( aiming at a qualitative description of the dynamics we drop the amplitude factor @xmath118\\left ( 1-\\exp ( \\hbar \\omega /t)\\right ) ^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath119 is the debye - waller factor ) : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is given by ( [ matr ] ) .    as mentioned earlier in order to pick out the effects of the dynamical dissipative coupling we neglect the elastic coupling @xmath64 and assume that both channels @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equally - participating in the scattering process ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "then @xmath123 can be written in a simple form : @xmath124^{2}}{(\\omega ^{2}-c_{a}^{2}q^{2})^{2}(\\omega ^{2}-c_{b}^{2}q^{2})^{2}+(\\gamma _ { a}+\\gamma _ { b})\\omega ^{2}(\\omega ^{2}-c_{+}^{2}q^{2})^{2}}\\ , ,   \\notag\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with : @xmath125    the structure factor in the so - called pseudo acoustic regime ( when @xmath107 is close to a nonzero bragg peak ) is different from the acoustic structure factor ( [ ac ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting also that this feature is different from the case of phonons in conventional crystals .",
    "consider e.g. the pseudo acoustic region close to the bragg peak @xmath126 ( fig .",
    "because of the large energy separation , the modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are decoupled and the structure factor for mode @xmath0 is written as : @xmath127 the matrix element @xmath128 coincides with @xmath129 ( it corresponds to the umklapp coupling processes ) . on one side",
    "the @xmath130 phonon with @xmath131 is decoupled from the @xmath132 phonon with @xmath131 because of the large energy separation . at the same time",
    "the @xmath130 phonon with @xmath131 is equivalent to the @xmath130 phonon with @xmath2 , that in turn , is strongly coupled with the @xmath132 phonon with @xmath133 .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives @xmath134 the results of the calculations of @xmath135 for different values of @xmath136 scanning the structure factor at a fixed value of @xmath2 are shown in fig .",

    "parameters : @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148.,width=321 ]    the picture presented above leads to the following qualitative predictions :    * the maximum in @xmath149 due to the sublattice phonon with the lower frequency disappears at a certain wavevector . *",
    "both @xmath123 and @xmath150 , @xmath151 have asymmetric profiles with  antiresonance ",
    "points where they vanish ( as in the case of the fano resonance , when the interference of a discrete state with a continuum gives rise to characteristically asymmetric peaks in excitation spectra ) ; * although @xmath152 , @xmath153 correspond to  decoupled  phonons , they show traces of mixing between the two phonon branches because of the umklapp process ; * at low @xmath2 we always have a double peak structure with a central peak and a sound - like side peak .",
    "let us sum up the results of our paper . we propose a simple phenomenological model describing a composite crystal , constructed from two sets of periodic inter - penetrating chains having a common direction ( either commensurate or incommensurate ) .",
    "we intentionally restrict ourselves to the simplest case taking into account mainly the dissipative coupling of the two subsystems , since theoretical modelling of composite crystals is often hampered by lack of detailed knowledge concerning the parameters entering more complete and more sophisticated models than the present one .    as incommensurate composites do not possess translational symmetry",
    ", one can not define a brillouin zone . in zero order approximation",
    "if both sublattices are independent , there are two phonon modes ( one for each sublattice ) but only one sound velocity ( in the long - wavelength limit ) .",
    "coupling between sublattices leads ( again in the hydrodynamic , i.e. @xmath8 limit ) to one acoustic mode for the composite , and one sliding mode , as found above . in this limit",
    "the acoustic mode is associated with a global translation of the composite , while the sliding mode describes the relative  dressed  translation of the two sublattices .",
    "we find the eigenmodes of the system and calculate the dynamical structure factor @xmath154 .",
    "we show that at high frequencies there are two longitudinal sound modes with wave vector independent attenuation , while in the low frequency region there is one propagating sound mode and two over - damped phase modes .",
    "the structure factor has a specific profile resembling the fano resonance .",
    "we anticipate that these effects will be observable , and that understanding the physical mechanism will be essential to predict the behaviour of the composite materials .",
    "however a number of remarks related to our results are in order .",
    "first , the separation of high and low frequency regions depends on the natural scale @xmath155 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ x ] - [ x3 ] ) ) , and the large @xmath2 or @xmath136 limit corresponds to the uncoupled case , when both eigenvectors are those of acoustic modes propagating more or less independently , while in the opposite limit the chains are tightly coupled .",
    "of course in real materials the critical wave vector @xmath156 could be so large that the coupled limit is adequate over the whole accessible range of wave vectors .",
    "second , in fact we considered a composite chain system embedded into two dimensional space .",
    "thus one should distinguish between modes propagating along the @xmath11 and @xmath37 directions .",
    "for the modes propagating along @xmath11 we found in the low @xmath2 limit two diffusive and one pair of degenerate sound like modes .",
    "in addition there are transverse modes which are : two time - conjugated optical ones ( i.e. with a gap ) and two time - conjugated acoustic modes ( sound like ) . for the propagation along @xmath37",
    "the situation is inverse : transverse modes give two diffusive modes and two time - conjugated sound like modes , while longitudinal modes are two time - conjugated optical modes and two time - conjugated acoustic modes .",
    "note also that it is to be expected that the forces coupling the two chains are weak for relative displacements along the chain direction but of normal strength for displacements perpendicular to the chains .",
    "it implies that even the smallest wave vectors parallel to the @xmath11 - axis probed e.g. by neutrons ( see below our short survey of experimental data ) may fall within the large @xmath2 uncoupled regime , whereas all wave vectors in the orthogonal directions are in the normal coupled regime .",
    "third , we assumed that atomic motions are not related to charge fluctuations ( therefore we neglected coulomb forces ) .",
    "as a result of coulomb interactions additional @xmath84 gaps ( plasmon gaps ) will open , and in addition long - range coulomb interactions will lead to a renormalization of the short - range elastic constants .",
    "the detailed discussion of all these problems is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "it is worth to compare the predictions of the present model , with results of @xcite where the authors also stressed the relevance of dynamical couplings .",
    "qualitatively ( especially in the low frequency region ) our model leads to the same three longitudinal modes as predicted in @xcite .",
    "however we presented a much simpler derivation which offers a deeper insight into the physical structure of the problem . besides we should stress that we determined as well the dispersion laws for the transverse modes and for the high - frequency region we found an unusual @xmath2-independent contribution to the sound modes attenuation ( due to our dynamical coupling ) superimposed on the conventional ( @xmath157 ) line - width .",
    "note also that for our model there are no universal inequalities between sound mode velocities @xmath158 as reported in @xcite .    in spite of the current research activity in the field of composite crystals",
    ", there are still few experimental results to which model predictions can be compared .",
    "furthermore , the generic aspects of composite crystals which this and other models aim to describe , are often masked in practice by other effects , specific to each particular compound under study .",
    "one of the first composite systems studied with respect to dynamics , is the @xmath159  mercury - chain  compound , which turned out to be a rather complex and unique system with two orthogonal sets of @xmath160 - chains , showing 1d liquid - like behaviour at high temperature ( @xmath161 ) @xcite .",
    "below @xmath162 , the long - range phase - correlation between parallel @xmath160 - chains is established through indirect interchain interactions , mediated by the orthogonal set of @xmath160 - chains ( which order simultaneously ) .",
    "hence the compound is not a good 1d - composite model system .",
    "the alkane - urea compounds @xcite appear a priori as better model systems because of their strongly uniaxial hexagonal structure .",
    "however , the structural transition at @xmath163 , marking the onset of ferroelastic domains , precludes a detailed inelastic neutron or brillouin study at low temperatures , where mode - broadening due to molecular disorder and anharmonic effects could be suppressed .",
    "the report by schmicker et al .",
    ", @xcite of brillouin scattering evidence for a propagating phase mode , has clearly been refuted by subsequent measurements by ollivier et al .",
    "instead , these latter authors report observing essentially normal acoustic dispersions and a quasielastic line polarized in the chain direction , which they ascribe to an overdamped , pinned phase mode . in the limit when the mode damping coefficient @xmath164 exceeds the pinning frequency @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) , the phase - mode response would become quasielastic with a width @xmath167 .",
    "it is indeed quite plausible that , in the @xmath2-range covered by light scattering , neither @xmath165 nor @xmath164 would show much @xmath2-dependence , in which case one would not expect much @xmath2-dependence for the quasielastic linewidth @xmath168 , in agreement with the results in ref .",
    "it conforms as well with our theoretical predictions presented in section iii .",
    "the fact that @xmath168 is also found to be @xmath169-independent between @xmath170 and @xmath171 , is much more puzzling since , over such a wide @xmath169-range , one would expect @xmath165 to soften and @xmath45 to increase with @xmath169 , leading to a significantly narrower quasielastic line at room-@xmath169 , in clear contradiction with the measurements .",
    "hence , the assignment of the observed quasielastic line as a collective excitation must be taken as tentative only .",
    "on the other hand inelastic neutron scattering data on the n=19 alkane - urea compound @xcite , show only one longitudinal acoustic ( la ) mode in the chain direction ( instead of two as would be expected in the high - q limit ) , with an anomalous q - independent linewidth .",
    "the non - observation of the collective modes associated with the alkane sublattice can be ascribed to the strong orientational and translational disorder of the alkane molecules @xcite , @xcite above @xmath162 .",
    "another interesting system is the aperiodic layered crystal @xmath172 , which was recently suggested to belong to the class of composite ( rather than modulated ) incommensurate systems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the mode structure observed by etrillard et al .",
    "@xcite is consistent with the presence of two independent @xmath173 branches along the incommensurate direction , as expected in the @xmath2-range of the neutron experiment .",
    "the relative strength of the two branches is however not understood , nor is the absence of a similar sublattice decoupling for the @xmath174 branches polarised in the incommensurate direction .",
    "it is obvious from the above remarks that the experimental situation still remains very open . to a large extent",
    ", this is due to the difficulty in identifying suitable model systems and in growing single - crystal specimens of appropriate size and quality for light and neutron scattering experiments .",
    "we hope that this work stimulates further efforts in this field .",
    "one of the authors ( e.k ) is indebted to rffr and intas grants for parial support .",
    "the equilibrium positions of the atoms in the incommensurate direction ( @xmath11 ) could be written in a more abridged form than ( [ ckl1 ] ) , namely @xmath175 @xmath176 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "both functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be found from a static microscopic model .",
    "the energy of interaction within the chains is written as usually , the dynamical coupling in the dissipation function can be written as : @xmath177 where @xmath178 can be modelled as : @xmath179 \\ , .\\ ] ] suppose we have a relatively long - range coupling @xmath180 . in the case similar to that considered in the main text of the paper the equations of motion ( after fourier transformation over @xmath181 ) read @xmath182 @xmath183 @xmath184 @xmath185 or , after space fourier transformation in @xmath186 , @xmath187 : @xmath188 , @xmath189 @xmath190 @xmath191",
    "@xmath192 @xmath193 these equations give @xmath194 which we need for the analysis of the neutron scattering ."
