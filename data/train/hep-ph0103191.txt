    "many situations of interest in particle physics and cosmology are close to thermal equilibrium with fields which have slowly varying ensemble averages .",
    "two examples in the early universe are where the time evolution is due to the expansion of the universe or the slow change of an inflaton field . in",
    "is important in such situations to understand both how dissipation affects the dynamics and how the how the dynamics , in turn , reacts back on the thermal ensemble .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "the behaviour of ensemble averages can be usefully encoded in an effective action . for systems in thermal equilibrium an imaginary time formulation",
    "is usually used @xcite , but this is only appropriate for slowly varying spatial fields @xcite . for systems that are not in thermal equilibrium , the effective action can be introduced within the closed time path formalism invented by schwinger which allows ensemble averages to evolve in time @xcite .",
    "the relativistic formulation @xcite allows a full account of the dynamics of nonlinear quantum fields and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the case of slowly varying ensemble averages lends itself to a derivative expansion of the effective action .",
    "terms that are linear in time derivatives are responsible for dissipative effects , where the short wavelength modes behave as a thermal bath damping the long wavelength average .",
    "early work was done on this problem by hosoya et al .",
    "@xcite , who were studying the problem of reheating in the inflationary universe .",
    "the first derivative terms in the closed time path formalism have been studied for a self - interacting scalar field by gleiser et al @xcite .",
    "higher order derivative terms have been obtained by das and hot @xcite , although they restricted themselves to terms quadratic in the fields .",
    "berera et al .",
    "@xcite have further examined the first derivative terms and done some preliminary work on higher derivative terms .",
    "their work has been largely stimulated by the warm inflationary scenario , where the evolution of the inflaton field is damped by thermal interactions @xcite .",
    "the first problem in a derivative expansion is that free field theory is not a good place to begin .",
    "this is because a non - interacting system has no way to re - establish thermal equilibrium after an external disturbance , and so successive disturbances will drive the system further and further from equilibrium .",
    "this problem could be avoided by considering only a small time interval @xcite , but the prefered method is to begin with an equilibrium theory with a dressed propagator which damps down the effects of the external forces @xcite .",
    "a new justification of this approach based on the effective action will be given in appendix a.    we shall see that the propagator has a simple representation in terms of a proper time kernel . unlike the zero temperature case , the kernel is nonvanishing in both forwards and backwards proper time directions .",
    "the use of the proper time kernel simplifies the derivative expansion of the effective action .",
    "application of the derivative expansion to a scalar field coupled to a heat bath confirms that the derivative expansion is an expansion in powers of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 characterises the damping effects of the particles in the heat bath .",
    "resummation of the derivative expansion is possible in the case that the second and higher derivatives of the averaged field vanish .",
    "the results indicate that the resummation introduces logarithmic terms in the high temperature limit .    in an attempt to understand the necessity for including damping terms in the derivative expansion the formalism",
    "is applied to quantum electrodynamics in section v. dissipative effects at non - zero temperatures are well known physical phenomena .",
    "constant electric fields , for example , drive currents through the plasma . these can be calculated from the nonequilibrium effective action .",
    "the current can also be estimated by elementary drude theory and demonstrates how the damping is related to collisions between accellerated electrons and thermal electrons or photons .",

    "the path integral version used here follows calzetta and hu @xcite .    at the initial time @xmath5 the probability distribution of the quantum field is given by a density matrix @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the generating functional is then defined by a path integral over the two fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are given the same values at the final time @xmath9 , @xmath10=\\int d\\mu[\\phi_1]\\int d\\mu[\\phi_2]\\rho[\\phi_1,\\phi_2 ] e^{is[\\phi_1]+i\\int j_1\\phi_1-is^*[\\phi_2]-i\\int j_2\\phi_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 $ ] is the classical action and two sources @xmath12 and @xmath13 have been introduced .",

    "the effective action can be approximated in various ways .",

    "specifically , @xmath32 where @xmath33 contains the interaction terms in the action and ( in momentum space ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sum of equilibrium self - energy corrections to the propagator .    using dressed propagators avoids divergent terms arising in the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is the dissipation introduced by the mass correction @xmath35 which balances the effect of the external sources . a derivation of the corrected one loop approximation ( [ cola ] )",
    "is given in appendix a.    some general statements can be made about the form of the equilibrium propagator @xmath36 .",
    "it will be useful to review these properties of @xmath36 in order to introduce some matrix notation which will be used in subsequent sections .",
    "the propagator can be obtained from the generating functional by @xmath37 the symmetry ( [ symz ] ) of the generating functional implies ( for bosons ) @xmath38 furthermore , there are two physical conditions .",
    "causality implies ( see @xcite ) , @xmath39 thermal equilibrium imposes periodicity in the imaginary time direction , @xmath40 fermion propagators are antiperiodic .    the symmetry and the causality conditions reduce the number of independent functions needed to describe the propagator .",
    "for example , it is possible to write the propagator in terms of functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 .    in thermal equilibrium",
    ", the propagator can also be expressed in terms of the spectral function @xmath45 in momentum space , the symmetries of the propagator imply that it takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the sign function .",
    "the periodicity in imaginary time gives @xmath49 with the upper signs for bosons and the lower signs for fermions .",

    "the general form of the propagator can now be compared with the dressed propagator ( [ dressed ] ) .",

    "the propagator is often written in a hybrid form which depends on spatial momentum and time @xcite .",
    "the inverse transform can be evaluated by using equations ( [ genp ] ) , ( [ nmatrix ] ) and ( [ spectral ] ) , then for @xmath64 , @xmath65 this is a very unwieldy expression to integrate , especially when there two or more propagators involved in a perturbative diagram .",
    "an alternative method for evaluating integrals of propagators is given in the next section .",
    "a new idea will now be introduced to simplify manipulations involving the propagator .",
    "this is the introduction of a proper time kernel , related to the kernel which was introduced into zero temperature field theory by schwinger @xcite .",
    "it is also related to the use feymann parameters for the evaluation of feynman diagrams .    the proper time kernel @xmath66 is a @xmath67 matrix , although the matrix indices will not be written out explicitly . for convenience in switching between configuration and momentum space",
    "the bra and ket notation will be used and the kernel regarded as an operator @xmath68 .",

    "a useful property of the one loop action is that the mass can be shifted by an arbirary function @xmath105 , @xmath106 this follows from the properties of the proper time kernel .",
    "the effective field equations are obtained by differentiating the effective action .",
    "the one loop contribution is therefore @xmath107 with the physical condition @xmath108 , the function @xmath28 is related to the interaction lagrangian @xmath109 , @xmath110 and we use the shifting property ( [ amatrix ] ) to get the main result of this section @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
