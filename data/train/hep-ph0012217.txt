    "the dominant contributions are from the exchange of charged scalars as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this could be well understood since the contributions from the charged scalars , in contrast to the decays studied in 2hdm - ii@xcite , are not suppressed but enhanced by a factor @xmath98 when @xmath93 is large .",
    "the neutral scalars play no important role except for sufficiently large @xmath93 . for the illustrative values in the numerical results ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath183 , the contributions of neutral scalars are still much smaller than those of charged scalars . however , as showed in the analytical expressions , the contributions of neutral scalars in fig .",
    "2 are two orders higher in @xmath93 than those of charged scalars in fig .  1 .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large @xmath93 the contributions of neutral scalars could also be important .",
    "the possible large enhancements over those predicted by the sm might be detectable in future experiments since the sensitivity of the new generation of b experiment to these processes should be quite high .",
    "if such large enhancements are observed in future experiments , they could be interpreted in such a technicolor model although this model might not be the unique one to explain them .",
    "if not observed , further stringent constraints on the model parameter space could be obtained and thus this model would be severely disfavored .",
