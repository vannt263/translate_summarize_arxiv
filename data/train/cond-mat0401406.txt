    "since the latter is a type of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , it should possess the whole spectrum of stationary solutions . in the presence of a trapping potential , the related energy spectrum is , in general , discrete .",
    "stationary solutions to the gpe are , by definition , the topological coherent modes , whose ground state describes the standard bose - einstein condensate , while the higher states correspond to nonground - state bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "it is worth saying a few words recalling where the name _ topological coherent modes _ comes from .",
    "different stationary solutions to the gpe , associated with different energy levels , display principally different spatial shapes , in particular , different number of zeros .",
    "because of their distinct spatial topology , the modes are termed _",
    "topological_. these should not be confused with elementary collective excitations , defined by linear bogolubov - de gennes equations .",
    "such elementary excitations describe small oscillations around a given stationary solution and do not change the topology of the latter .",
    "since the gpe is nonlinear , its solutions can also be named _ nonlinear _ modes , which would stress their principal difference from elementary excitations satisfying the linear bogolubov - de gennes equations .",
    "however , the elementary excitations , produced by strong perturbations , are sometimes also called nonlinear .",
    "therefore the term topological , characterizing dissimilar modes , seems to be more precise .",
    "the topological modes are specified as _",
    "coherent _ due to the fact that the gpe can be interpreted as an exact equation for coherent states @xcite .",
    "the possibility of resonant generation of arbitrary topological coherent modes was advanced in ref .",
    "a particular case of vortex creation was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the properties of such modes were also studied in @xcite  @xcite and a dipole topological mode was excited in experiment @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates with topological coherent modes exhibit a variety of interesting features which could find many applications . among these features",
    ", we could mention the following .",
    "_ mode locking _ : this is the effect under which the fractional mode populations are locked to stay in the vicinity of their initial values @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this effect is analogous to self - trapping occurring for atoms in double - well potentials @xcite .",
    "_ critical dynamics _ : an abrupt qualitative change of dynamics of fractional mode populations under an infinitesimally small variation of the pumping parameters @xcite .",
    "a mathematically similar effect in the case of double - well potentials is the dynamic phase transition between the rabi and josephson regimes @xcite . _ interference patterns _ : specific interference fringes arising because of differing spatial shapes of different topological modes @xcite .",
    "_ interference current _ : fastly oscillating current , existing even inside a single - well trap @xcite .",
    "such a type of current , arising between two interpenetrating populations , not separated by any barrier , is , on occasion , called the internal josephson effect @xcite .",
    "_ atomic squeezing _ : narrowing of the dispersion corresponding to the mode population difference , compared to the dispersion related to dipole transitions @xcite .",
    "a similar feature is illustrated by two - component condensates @xcite .",
    "_ irreducible modes _ : these are the topological modes that have no linear counterparts , so that they can not be considered as analytical continuations , under increasing of nonlinearity , of the related linear modes @xcite .",
    "such modes , in addition to strong nonlinearity , require the presence of multiwell potentials @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the mode spectrum in the case of single - well traps shows that in this case nonlinear modes are reducible and can be treated as analytical continuations of linear counterparts @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we generalize the theory of resonant formation of topological coherent modes and study the features that have not been considered in previous publications .",
    "the most important novel points are as follows :    1 .",
    "the possibility of resonant generation of multiple topological coherent modes is described .",
    "this can be achieved by subjecting a trapped bose - einstein condensate to the action of several alternating fields , whose frequencies are tuned to distinct transition frequencies related to different modes ( sec .  [",
    "sec : resgen ] ) .",
    "a general criterion is derived , showing when nonlinear modes can not be generated even if the applied alternating field is in perfect resonance with the corresponding transition frequency .",
    "this condition relates the spatial dependence of the trapping potential and that of the alternating field ( sec .",
    "[ sec : nogo ] ) .",
    "simultaneous generation of two excited coherent modes is studied in detail .",
    "the resulting dynamical system describes three coexisting nonlinear modes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : threemodes ] ) .",
    "the phase portrait of the three - mode dynamical system is investigated .",
    "all fixed points are found and their stability is analysed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : stabil ] ) .",
    "harmonic generation of topological modes is shown to exist .",
    "this effect is analogous to optical harmonic generation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : harmgen ] ) . 6 .",
    "parametric conversion for topological modes is another effect having its optical counterpart . to realize this effect , it is necessary to subject trapped atoms to the action of several alternating fields ( sec .",
    "[ sec : harmgen ] ) . 7 .",
    "the principal feature of this article is that all consideration has been done in two ways , by applying approximate analytical methods and also by numerically solving the gpe .",
    "numerical solutions confirm all effects described analytically .",

    "the transition frequencies for two distinct modes @xmath18 are @xmath19 the trap modulation is resonant if the frequency of an applied alternating field is tuned close to one of the transition frequencies ( [ org5 ] )",
    ". this resonant field can induce transitions between the considered modes . everywhere in what follows , talking about resonance , we keep in mind the resonant transitions between distinct topological modes .",
    "this should not be confused with parametric resonance , when one considers a single mode , whose width can become divergent under special conditions on the amplitude of a perturbing field @xcite .",
    "previously , the resonant excitation of topological modes has been considered for the case of a sole resonant field coupling two chosen modes @xcite .",
    "now , we turn to the most general case , when there are several alternating fields , so that the modulating potential is a sum @xmath20\\ ] ] of fields with different frequencies @xmath21 . generally , the amplitudes @xmath22 and @xmath23 can also be slow functions of time , whose temporal variation is slow compared to that of @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 if these amplitudes are such slow functions of time , then , varying them adiabatically , one could induce the landau - zener tunneling @xcite .",
    "but here we shall consider only the transitions caused by the fastly oscillating @xmath26 .",
    "each frequency @xmath21 is assumed to be close to one of the transition frequencies ( [ org5 ] ) , so that the _ resonance conditions _",

    "there exist two characteristic quantities , called transition amplitudes ; one is the matrix element @xmath30 ) , and another one is the matrix element @xmath31 related to the amplitude @xmath32 of the modulating potential ( [ org9 ] ) . here , @xmath33 denotes the usual scalar product of schrdinger theory . to avoid intensive power broadening",
    ", these amplitudes ( [ org11 ] ) and ( [ org12 ] ) have to satisfy the inequalities @xmath34 where @xmath18 and whose meaning was explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "conditions ( [ org13 ] ) allow for an effective generation of nonlinear modes by resonant fields .",
    "the first of these restrictions , briefly speaking , can be reduced to the limitation on the number of atoms that can be transferred to an excited coherent mode @xcite .",
    "this limiting number of atoms is close to the critical number of atoms with attractive interactions , for which the bose - einstein condensate preserves its stability @xcite .",
    "therefore the resonant generation of nonlinear modes is feasible for atoms with positive as well as negative scattering lengths .    the topological coherent modes , being the solutions to the nonlinear eigenproblem ( [ org4 ] ) , do not compulsory form a complete orthonormal basis .",
    "however , the modes @xmath35 can always be normalized , so that @xmath36 . and the set @xmath37 of all linearly independent functions forms a total basis @xcite , permitting one to look for the solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ org1 ] ) in terms of the presentation @xmath38 where @xmath39 are unknown functions of time .",
    "note that for some nonlinear eigenproblems , it has been rigorously proved @xcite that the set of the corresponding eigenfunctions forms a complete basis . in our case , it is sufficient to require that the functions @xmath39 are slowly varying , such that @xmath40 and conditions ( [ org13 ] ) hold true . then the expansion ( [ org14 ] ) is uniquely defined by means of the averaging technique @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the presentation ( 14 ) ideally suits for analysing resonant transitions between the coherent topological modes . and it is solely these modes that are the subject of the present paper .",
    "we shall not consider here other possible excitations that could be produced by nonresonant driving fields and studied by means of the known rescaling procedure .",
    "nontopological nonresonant breathing - type oscillations have been considered by many authors in the early days of the bec research ( see reviews @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "therefore there is no reason of extending the paper by repeating similar results .",
    "this is why here we limit ourselves by treating only the resonant generation of topological modes , which have not been studied earlier .",
    "aiming at exciting particular modes , one should keep in mind , in addition to the resonance conditions ( [ org8 ] ) , the symmetry properties of the corresponding wave functions , for which the modulating field has to be such that the transition amplitudes ( [ org12 ] ) be nonzero .",
    "however , even if all above mentioned conditions hold true , there exists a rather general situation when the generation of modes is impossible .",
    "it may happen that the applied modulating field is not able to generate higher nonlinear modes , but can only lead to the oscillation of the initial wave function , without changing its shape .",
    "more precisely , let us start with a wave function @xmath41 .",
    "after a modulating field @xmath42 begins acting on atoms , the function @xmath41 is transferred to a function @xmath6 .",
    "when the _ shape - conservation condition _ @xmath43 , then the shape of the atomic cloud does not change in time , but the cloud oscillates as a whole , with its center of mass moving according to the dependence @xmath44 .",
    "hence , if we start with a mode @xmath41 it can never be transferred to another mode .    by definition ,",
    "the initial function @xmath45 presents a nonlinear mode if it satisfies the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath46\\;\\varphi_0({\\bf r } ) = e_0\\;\\varphi_0({\\bf r } ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] with the nonlinear hamiltonian ( [ org2 ] ) .",
    "we assume that this initial mode is real - valued , i.e. , @xmath47 an example for this would be the ground - state of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "in addition , we are focusing on _ trapped _ atoms , which implies that the confining potential @xmath9 increases towards infinity for @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the _ trapping condition _",
    "@xmath49 is valid for all @xmath50 .    _",
    "theorem_. suppose that atoms in a trapping potential @xmath9 , being initially in a real mode @xmath51 , are subject to the action of a modulating field @xmath42 , so that conditions ( [ org17 ] ) to ( [ org19 ] ) are valid .",
    "then the solution of the temporal gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ org1 ] ) preserves the shape of the initial mode , satisfying condition ( [ org16 ] ) , if and only if the trapping potential is harmonic , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the cartesian indices , while the modulating field is linear with respect to the spatial variables , @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 being arbitrary functions of time . and the center - of - mass motion @xmath58 is described by the equation @xmath59    _ proof_. assume that the shape - conservation condition ( [ org16 ] ) holds true , and let us show that then the trapping and modulating potentials are necessarily such as in eqs .",
    "( [ org20 ] ) and ( [ org21 ] ) . for this purpose , it is useful to invoke the presentation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a real action defining the velocity @xmath62 substituting the presentation ( [ org23 ] ) into the gpe ( [ org1 ] ) yields @xcite@xcite the continuity equation    @xmath63    and the velocity equation @xmath64 in which the effective potential @xmath65 because of the shape - conservation condition ( [ org16 ] ) , one has @xmath66 using this in the continuity equation ( [ org25 ] ) results in @xmath67 = 0 \\ ; , \\ ] ] from where @xmath68 if here the function @xmath69 is not zero , then from the trapping condition ( [ org19 ] ) it follows that @xmath70 as @xmath71 hence , the action @xmath72 as @xmath71 .",
    "but then the limit @xmath71 of the function ( [ org23 ] ) is not defined .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the velocity ( [ org24 ] ) becomes @xmath74 which is a function of time only .",
    "but then the velocity equation ( [ org26 ] ) tells us that @xmath75 is also a function of time only , hence the effective potential is linear in @xmath76 , having the form @xmath77 taking into account that the initial mode is real - valued , as is conditioned by eq .",
    "( [ org18 ] ) , and employing the shape - conservation condition ( [ org16 ] ) , one gets @xmath78 ) can be written as @xmath79 since , according to eq .",
    "( [ org29 ] ) , the effective potential is linear in @xmath76 , @xmath80 is a constant , and @xmath81 is a function of time , then the sum of the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ org31 ] ) should also be linear in @xmath76 , such that @xmath82 thence the effective potential ( [ org31 ] ) takes the form @xmath83 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ org29 ] ) and ( [ org33 ] ) , we have @xmath84 equality ( [ org32 ] ) can be satisfied only if the trapping and modulating potentials are given by eqs .",

    "( [ org22 ] ) for the center - of - mass motion .    now let us show that eqs .",
    "( [ org20 ] ) and ( [ org21 ] ) are sufficient for the validity of the shape - conservation condition ( [ org16 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ org25 ] ) and ( [ org26 ] ) , with the effective potential ( [ org27 ] ) and with the initial conditions @xmath87 are equivalent to the gpe ( [ org1 ] ) with the initial condition ( [ org18 ] ) . the latter equation is a nonlinear schrdinger equation , which , being complimented by the boundary condition ( [ org19 ] ) , possesses a unique solution @xcite",

    "do have a solution satisfying the shape - conservation condition ( [ org16 ] ) , which , according to the aforesaid , is a unique solution .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "one should not confuse the shape - conservation criterion derived here with the known result of the decoupled center - of - mass motion in a harmonic potential .",
    "the criterion of shape conservation shows when the wave function retains its shape under the action of an external alternating field and when the shape is not preserved . the center - of - mass motion is a trivial byproduct of our theorem .",
    "the principal point is the shape conservation .",
    "the derived criterion shows that the trapping potential may be harmonic , but , if the driving field is nonlinear , then , irrespectively of the center - of - mass motion , the shape of the wave function will not be conserved .",
    "this theorem teaches us that if the trapping potential is harmonic , which is a standard situation , then the modulating field , being linear in @xmath76 , is not able to generate topological modes , even if its alternating temporal parts oscillate in an exact resonance with the corresponding transition frequencies .",
    "it is in full agreement with a nonlinear ehrenfest - theorem for the mean position and variance of the collective wavefunction @xcite . to generate such modes ,",
    "at least one of the conditions ( [ org20 ] ) or ( [ org21 ] ) has to be broken .",
    "but if a resonant alternating field is linear and the trapping potential is harmonic , then the real initial mode just moves in space , without changing its shape .",
    "we have checked this conclusion by numerically solving the gpe under conditions ( [ org20 ] ) and ( [ org21 ] ) and found a perfect agreement with the theorem .",
    "several modes can be generated by applying a modulating field ( [ org6 ] ) containing several corresponding resonant terms .",
    "in general , two cases are admissible : when the excited modes are not coupled to each other and when they are coupled . in the former case ,",
    "the overall dynamics consists of the motion of several pairs of modes , each pair being separated in its motion from other modes .",
    "the motion of such separate pairs of resonant modes has been studied in detail earlier @xcite .",
    "therefore we now concentrate on the case of several coupled modes .",
    "we consider the case of three coupled modes , whose transition frequencies ( [ org5 ] ) are enumerated as @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , keeping in mind that the related energy levels are such that @xmath91 . to couple the modes ,",
    "it is sufficient to have two modulating fields of the possible three that would be in resonance with the corresponding transition frequencies . in general",

    "different initial conditions have been considered in the range @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 . for small @xmath145 , the solutions for the population differences @xmath146 and @xmath147 demonstrate a kind of nonlinear rabi oscillations in the mode locked regime , when @xmath148 and @xmath149 do not cross the zero line , being always either above or below it , depending on initial conditions .",
    "this mode locked regime is the same as in the case of two modes , studied earlier @xcite .",
    "the difference with the two - mode case is that the rabi - type oscillations look slightly more complicated , being quasiperiodic but not periodic .",
    "increasing @xmath138 results in the increase of the oscillation amplitudes , and , after a critical value of @xmath138 , the mode unlocked regime arises , when either @xmath148 , or @xmath149 , or both of them , oscillate in the whole interval [ -1,1 ] . to illustrate these two regimes , we present numerical calculations accomplished for equal parameters @xmath150 with the initial conditions @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",

    "however , before turning to this task , we will compare the results of the averaging method described above with those of a direct numerical simulation of the gpe for several special cases .",
    "although the averaging technique is a well grounded mathematical method @xcite , it is interesting to show that the main effects , described above , also appear in a direct numerical simulation of the time evolution described by eq .",
    "( [ org1 ] ) .",

    "the averaging method may break down .",
    "we will demonstrate both situations using the numerical methods and parameter settings which are described in the appendix .",
    "the case of an anharmonic trapping potential is most suited to demonstrate the benefits of the few - mode averaging method .",
