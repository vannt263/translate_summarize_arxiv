    "quantum gravity effects coming from planck scale energies may appear as small violations of fundamental laws in the limit of low energies .",
    "one possibility is the breaking of both lorentz and cpt symmetries .",
    "a comprehensive investigation of this case is made viable , for instance , in the framework known as the standard model extension@xcite , the most general effective model comprising particle lorentz and cpt violation but coordinate invariant .",
    "the minimal extension respects the standard model @xmath0 gauge symmetry and is power - counting renormalizable . in this proceedings contribution",
    "we report our progress in the study of finite one - loop radiative corrections in the minimal lorentz- and cpt - violating qed extension .",
    "the lorentz- and cpt - violating qed extension for one dirac fermion can be described by the lagrange density@xcite @xmath1 where lorentz violation ( lv ) is parameterized by coefficients in the form of constant background fields  see the last two terms of eq .",
    "( [ qedex ] ) and the definitions @xmath2 @xmath3 we also add to ( [ qedex ] ) a photon mass term @xmath4 to control infrared divergences and a gauge - fixing piece @xmath5 .",
    "we follow the guidelines presented in ref .   to deal with",
    "one - loop radiative corrections : evaluations are performed in the so - called concordant frames to avoid issues with the perturbative expansion ; nonlinear lv is disregarded because it could lead to effects comparable to multiloop ones , which we do not consider ; and lv pieces of the lagrange density ( [ qedex ] ) are treated as new interaction vertices , effectively entering as propagator or vertex insertions , as allowed by the experimental smallness of lv .",
    "as a first step , we considered only the @xmath6 and @xmath7 coefficients .",
    "results for the photon self - energy can be found in ref .  , so our goal was first the vertex correction diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "the electron self - energy was used so far only to check the related gauge identity ( more details below ) , and its evaluation will be our next goal .",
    "the lv contribution with one @xmath6 insertion comes from two diagrams , figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) and [ fig : fig1](c ) , with the new feynman rule @xmath8 and the contribution from @xmath7 comes from the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d ) , where @xmath9 these insertions lower the superficial degree of divergence of vertex - correction loop integrals , making them actually finite , avoiding complications related to @xmath10 .",
    "aiming for generality , we computed both cases with fermions and photon off shell , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and we made no use of the dirac equation .",
    "since gordon identities are unavailable to make further simplifications  they are valid only on shell  the final result itself is not very illuminating because of its size and structure , but it is worth mentioning that because we do not use @xmath13 our expressions contain not only pieces symmetric under @xmath14 but also pieces that are antisymmetric . on the other hand , symmetry under @xmath14 is recovered when the fermions go on shell , and the final expressions are greatly simplified .",
    "for instance , the lv correction due to @xmath7 has the structural form @xmath15 and the result from the @xmath16 insertion has the same structure but with the additional form @xmath17 , which vanishes for the @xmath7 contribution .    as a consistency check",
    ", we verified the ward - takashi identity , @xmath18 , for both cases up to order @xmath19 with arbitrary ir regulator @xmath20 , but so far with fermions on shell  the off shell case is still to be done .",
    "the ward - takashi identity demands the evaluation of lv contributions to the electron self energy , which are divergent .",
    "nevertheless , only the finite piece of this integral is momentum dependent and contributes to the right - hand side of the ward - takashi identity .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , different from the conventional qed case , @xmath21 even when the dirac equation is used for the external leg spinors : even in this situation the momentum shift in the electron self energy still contributes to the identity .",
    "the next step is to establish the finite contributions coming also from the divergent piece of the electron self energy , which may require a careful choice of subtraction points .",
    "applications in physical processes will also be envisaged , as well as the analysis for other lv coefficients .",
    "financial support was provided by cnpq ( brazil ) ."
