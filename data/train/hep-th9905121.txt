    "before the recent string duality revolution , most string phenomenology centered on perturbative @xmath0=1 d=4 heterotic string theories . the discovery of string duality and d - branes , however , opened a variety of new approaches to string phenomenology based on type i and type string theories .",
    "for example , much recent work has focussed on the intriguing possibility that our four - dimensional world lies at the intersection of a set of d@xmath4-branes ( 3@xmath5 @xmath4@xmath59 ) embedded in @xmath6-dimensional spacetime .",
    "a well - known problem with the usual perturbative heterotic string phenomenology is that hidden - sector gaugino condensation @xcite gives rise to visible - sector gaugino masses that are much smaller than the scale of supersymmetry breaking @xcite@xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a single dilaton couples to all gauge and matter fields .",
    "gaugino condensation induces a small @xmath7 term for the dilaton field , and the dilaton couplings then give small masses to the gauginos .",
    "in type i models , however , the situation can be very different . in these models",
    ", the hidden and visible sectors can live on different d - branes .",
    "each sector has its own dilaton - like fields @xcite .",
    "the hidden - sector dilatons receive small @xmath7 terms from gaugino condensation . however , these @xmath7 terms are not responsible for the visible - sector gaugino masses , and therefore the gaugino masses are not forced to be small .    inspired by this possibility , in this paper we study the question of supersymmetry breaking by hidden - sector gaugino condensation in @xmath0=1 d=4 supergravity models with multiple dilaton - like fields .",
    "we compute the visible - sector gaugino masses and find that they can indeed be of order the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "we see that type i models offer an appealing solution to the gaugino mass problem associated with heterotic string theories .",
    "we approach this problem in the spirit of effective field theory .",
    "we take our visible sector to be composed of multiple pure @xmath8=1 super yang - mills theories , each coupled to gravity , and each to its own dilaton - like field .",
    "we take our hidden sector to be composed of gaugino condensate fields , one on each set of branes .",
    "the condensate fields are also coupled to gravity , and to their associated dilatons . by construction , this theory describes the low - energy limit of a type i string theory , where each super yang - mills theory lives on its own set of d - branes .",
    "of course , our analysis also applies to other string / m theory vacua with multiple dilaton - like fields .",
    "various @xmath0=1 d=4 type i models have been proposed in the literature @xcite@xcite .",
    "particularly simple examples can be constructed from type i models with d9-branes and d5-branes compactified on @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the radius of the @xmath11th two - torus , @xmath12 .",
    "( d5-branes that wrap on the @xmath11th two - torus are denoted as d5@xmath13-branes . )",
    "these models have one dilaton field @xmath14 , three untwisted moduli fields @xmath15 ( @xmath12 ) and additional twisted moduli fields from the closed string sector .",
    "other d - brane configurations can be obtained from these by t - duality .",
    "one such example is a type i model with two sectors , built from d9-branes and d5@xmath16-branes .",
    "the gauge bosons arise from open strings ending on the d9- and d5@xmath16-branes .",
    "the low - energy effective lagrangian is as follows @xcite@xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the function .",
    "the dots denote possible contributions from other neutral chiral superfields , and @xmath19 0.1 in in these expressions , @xmath20 is the string coupling , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the string scale .",
    "the field strengths @xmath23 and @xmath24 contain gauge fields living on d9- and d5@xmath16-branes , respectively .",
    "note that the moduli @xmath14 , @xmath25 are dilaton - like fields , while @xmath26 , @xmath27 are not .",
    "and @xmath15 moduli agrees with @xcite , but differs from @xcite . ]",
    "a second example contains d9-branes as well as d5@xmath13-branes compactified on all three tori ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it has four sectors , and four dilaton - like fields , @xmath14 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , as defined in ( [ intro2 ] ) .",
    "these fields couple to the gauge fields on the d9- and d5@xmath13-branes and give rise to the effective lagrangian @xmath29    the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ model ] , we define our @xmath0=1 d=4 supergravity model with multiple dilaton - like fields . in section [ gaugino ] , we argue that the extra dilaton - like fields allow gaugino masses to be as large as the gravitino mass .",
    "we also present an explicit example of this scenario .    in appendix",
    "a , we exhibit the linear ",
    "chiral duality for @xmath0=1 d=4 supergravity models with multiple linear supermultiplets . in appendix",
    "b we extract the relevant pieces of the component supergravity lagrangian .",
    "finally , in appendix c we check our results by comparing with the formulation .",
    "in this section we define the @xmath0=1 d=4 supergravity model that we will study .",
    "we start by considering a system with @xmath30 different types of d - branes . of these ,",
    "we take @xmath31 to be d@xmath32-branes ( @xmath33 ) with weakly coupled visible - sector fields on their world volumes .",
    "we take the remaining @xmath34 to be d@xmath35-branes ( @xmath36 ) with strongly coupled hidden - sector fields in the condensation phase .",
    "let us first construct the effective theory of the visible sector .",
    "for each value of @xmath37 , let @xmath38 denote the super yang - mills field strength on the @xmath37-th set of branes , and let @xmath39 be the real superfield which contains the @xmath37-th dilaton - like field @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath39 obeys the constraint @xmath40 this constraint couples the dilatons to the super yang - mills fields .    in superspace",
    "@xcite , the supergravity kinetic terms are given by a lagrangian @xmath41 and a function @xmath42 .",
    "for the visible - sector fields , we take them to be @xmath43 where @xmath44 in these expressions , the leading terms describe the tree - level couplings of the gauge and dilaton - like fields ; the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 contain corrections beyond tree level .",
    "the condition ( [ model6 ] ) guarantees that the einstein gravity term is canonically normalized .",
    "( for simplicity , we do not include mixings between the different @xmath39 s .",
    "such mixings arise at the loop level , but they do not change our conclusions . and d@xmath47 gauge groups ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "these superfields mix the different dilaton - like fields .",
    "our study ignores charged chiral superfields , so it is consistent to ignore mixings between different @xmath39 s . ] )    in the hidden sector , the effective lagrangian is different because the super yang - mills fields are in a strongly - coupled condensation phase .",
    "this leads us to replace the yang - mills fields by chiral condensate superfields @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "these fields are contained within the real superfields @xmath50 @xcite@xcite , where @xmath51 the hidden - sector dilaton - like fields are also contained in the fields @xmath50 .",
    "the effective lagrangian for this sector contains kinetic and superpotential terms .",
    "the kinetic terms are as above , @xmath52 where @xmath53 the leading terms describe the tree - level couplings , while @xmath54 and @xmath55 contain corrections beyond tree level .",
    "the superpotential terms are generated by nonperturbative effects associated with gaugino condensation . in what follows ,",
    "we take the superpotential to be given by @xmath56 & = & \\,{\\int { \\mbox{d}}^{4}\\theta}\\,e\\,\\,b_{a}v_{a}\\ln\\(e^{\\!-k}\\bar{u}_{a}u_{a}\\),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57=@xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the one - loop @xmath60-function coefficient of d@xmath35-sector .",
    "the form of this term is dictated by the anomalies of the underlying super yang - mills theory @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "in rigid supersymmetry , the superpotential is fixed by the chiral and conformal anomalies @xcite .",
    "in local supersymmetry , the anomaly also comes into play @xcite@xcite .",
    "in particular , it fixes the explicit @xmath42 dependence of the superpotential . under an arbitrary transformation , @xmath61 , the fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the superpotential then transforms as follows , @xmath64 this is precisely the right transformation to match the anomaly of the underlying super yang - mills theory @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the full supergravity lagrangian contains contributions from both of these sectors .",
    "it can be written as follows , , @xmath65 . in the context of type",
    "i models , the @xmath66 are twisted or non - dilaton - like untwisted moduli fields . ]",
    "@xmath67 & & \\!\\!\\!+\\,\\sum_{a=1}^{n\\!-\\!\\tn}\\ ; { \\int { \\mbox{d}}^{4}\\theta}\\,e\\,\\,b_{a}v_{a}\\ln\\(e^{\\!-k}\\bar{u}_{a}u_{a}\\ ) , \\label{cond3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function is given by @xmath68 & & \\!\\!\\!+\\,g(\\phi_{1},\\bar{\\phi}_{1},\\cdots,\\phi_{n } , \\bar{\\phi}_{n } ) ,   \\label{cond2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath69 the hidden - sector superpotential couples all sectors through its explicit @xmath42 dependence ; it gives rise to gaugino masses in the visible sector .",
    "to find the gaugino masses , we need certain terms from the component - field lagrangian .",
    "these terms are computed in appendix b.    from ( [ cond29 ] ) we find that the scalar potential takes the following form , @xmath70 in this expression , @xmath71=@xmath72 and @xmath73=@xmath74 are the dilaton - like scalar fields which couple to the visible and hidden sectors , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath75=@xmath76 is the gaugino condensate field on each of the d@xmath35-branes ; it depends on @xmath77 according to ( [ cond34 ] ) .",
    "other notation is as follows , @xmath78 @xmath79    the gaugino mass has its origin in the explicit @xmath42 dependence of the hidden - sector superpotential . we find ( [ cond30 ] ) @xmath80",
    "the gravitino mass is simply @xmath81 to understand these formulae , let us first examine the gaugino mass in a theory with just one dilaton @xcite@xcite@xcite . in this case",
    "the gaugino mass is as follows @xcite , @xmath82 all scalar fields are evaluated at the minimum of the potential , @xmath83 from this we see that any vacuum with zero cosmological constant satisfies @xmath84 . since @xmath85 and @xmath86 are numbers of order one , equation ( [ mag3 ] ) implies that @xmath87 is smaller than @xmath88 by a factor of @xmath89 .",
    "let us compare this to a model in which the visible and hidden sectors couple to different dilaton - like fields .",
    "the scalar potential of ( [ cond40 ] ) receives contributions from both sectors , proportional to @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "however , to leading order , only @xmath92 contributes to the gaugino masses .",
    "as above , minimizing the potential forces @xmath93 to be @xmath94 , but it does not constrain @xmath95 .",
    "this suggests that the gaugino masses can indeed be as large as the gravitino mass .    to see this explicitly ,",
    "let us consider an example with just two types of d - branes ( @xmath31=1 and @xmath30=2 ) .",
    "each has its own dilaton - like field , @xmath96 and @xmath77 .",
    "the scalar potential follows from ( [ cond40 ] ) , with no summation over the indices @xmath97 and @xmath37 : @xmath98 \\;\\rbr \\bar{u}_{a}u_{a}.\\ ] ] the conditions for a nontrivial vacuum with vanishing cosmological constant are @xmath99 \\,+\\,\\co(b_{a}^{3 } ) , \\label{vacuum2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\langle 1+f^{a}-\\l_{a}\\df^{a}\\rangle\\,=\\ , b_{a}^{2}\\langle\\l_{a}^{2 } \\rangle\\[\\,3\\,-\\,\\langle 1+\\tf^{\\ta}-\\tl_{\\ta}\\dtf^{\\ta}\\rangle\\,\\ ] \\,+\\,\\co(b_{a}^{3 } ) , \\label{vacuum3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all @xmath100 terms are suppressed . these equations have a consistent solution if @xmath101 and @xmath102 is @xmath103 . since this latter term fixes the visible - sector gaugino mass , we expect @xmath104 to be of order @xmath105",
    ".    to actually compute the gaugino mass , we need to specify the functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "( the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 are determined via ( [ cond5 ] ) ) .",
    "we choose them to stabilize the runaway vacuum typically associated with dilaton - like fields .",
    "the general procedure is described in @xcite@xcite . for",
    "now , we consider the following simple choice , @xmath110 substituting ( [ vacuum4 ] ) into ( [ vacuum3 ] ) , we find that the potential has an extremum , located at @xmath111 \\ca\\,&=&\\,e^{2}\\,\\,+\\,\\,\\co(b_{a}^{2 } ) , \\label{vacuum7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any value of @xmath112 .",
    "it is , in fact , a global minimum of the potential with vanishing cosmological constant , as illustrated in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "let us now evaluate the gaugino mass in this vacuum .",
    "we find @xmath113 where @xmath114 we see that , for reasonable values of @xmath112 , the gaugino mass is of order the gravitino mass .",
    "the presence of multiple dilaton - like moduli fields is a very important feature of @xmath0=1 d=4 type i string models .",
    "the extra dilaton - like fields can change the resulting phenomenology in many ways . in this paper we examined their effect on supersymmetry breaking by hidden - sector gaugino condensation .",
    "we studied a scenario in which different dilaton - like fields couple to the hidden and visible sectors .",
    "we assumed that supersymmetry is broken by gaugino condensation in the hidden sector .",
    "we found that the visible - sector gaugino masses can be as large as gravitino mass because of the extra dilaton - like fields .",
    "our results stand in contrast to the usual heterotic string phenomenology , where the gaugino masses are typically much smaller .",
    "we would like to thank mary k.  gaillard and gary shiu for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grant no .",
    "in this appendix we prove that a supergravity model with @xmath30 linear supermultiplets is dual to another supergravity model with @xmath30 chiral supermultiplets .",
    "we will show that both models can be obtained from the following lagrangian , @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 in these expressions , the @xmath118 s are _ unconstrained _ real superfields and the @xmath119 s are ordinary chiral supermultiplets , for @xmath120 .",
