    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provides one of the most powerful ways of investigating the physics of the early universe .",
    "the main cmb observable is the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropy , which encodes a large amount of cosmological information . in the last decade ,",
    "important advances in the measurement of the cmb angular power spectrum took place ; this resulted in relevant progress in our understanding of physical cosmology .",
    "cmb temperature anisotropies were first detected by the cobe satellite in 1992 @xcite .",
    "this discovery fuelled a period of intensive experimental activity , focused on measuring the cmb power spectrum on a large range of angular scales .",
    "a major breakthrough was made in the past few years , when the maxima @xcite and boomerang @xcite balloon - borne experiments independently produced the first high - resolution maps of the cmb , allowing a clear measurement of a peak in the power spectrum , as expected from theoretical models and previously detected by the ground based experiment toco @xcite . since then , many other experiments have confirmed and improved on these results : dasi@xcite , boomerang - b98 @xcite , boomerang - b03 @xcite , vsa @xcite , archeops @xcite , cbi @xcite , acbar@xcite , beast @xcite .",
    "most notably , the nasa satellite mission wmap , whose first year data were released in february 2003 ( @xcite and references therein ) , provided the first high - resolution , full sky , multi - frequency cmb maps , and a determination of the angular power spectrum with unprecedented accuracy on a large range of angular scales . much larger and",
    "more accurate data sets are expected in the years to come from esa s planck satellite .    in this paper , we shall concentrate on extracting the cmb power spectrum from full sky maps with foregrounds removed .",
    "we shall focus mainly on techniques for dealing with noise subtraction . in principle , and for gaussian maps , noise subtraction can be performed by implementing maximum likelihood estimates .",
    "it is well known , through @xcite , that maximum likelihood estimates require for their implementations a number of operations that scales as @xmath1 @xmath2 denoting the number of pixels in the map . for current experiments ,",
    "@xmath3 ranges from several hundred thousands to a few millions , and thus the implementation of these procedures is beyond computer power for the near future .",
    "many different methods have been proposed for producing computationally feasible estimates ; here we just mention a few of them , and we refer the reader to @xcite for a more complete discussion on their merits . some authors have introduced special assumptions on the noise properties and symmetry of the sky coverage , to make likelihood estimates feasible ; see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite adopted an entirely different strategy , extracting the power spectrum from the 2-point correlation function of the map .",
    "others have used estimators based on pseudo-@xmath4 statistics and monte carlo techniques @xcite , or based on gabor transforms @xcite .",
    "for multi - detector experiments , an elegant method , based on spectral matching to estimate jointly the angular power spectrum of the signal and of the noise , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "pseudo-@xmath0 estimators were adopted by the wmap team @xcite , which used the cross - power spectrum estimator and discussed the best combination of the cross - power spectrum obtained from single couples of receivers .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to derive some analytic results on the cross - power spectrum estimator , to perform a comparison with standard pseudo-@xmath0 estimators , and to propose some testing procedures on the assumption that any noise bias has been properly removed , which is clearly a crucial step in any estimation approach .",
    "we shall also present some monte carlo evidence on the performance of the methods that we advocate .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : ps ]",
    "we derive the analytic properties for the cross - power spectrum estimator and we compare them with equivalent results on standard pseudo-@xmath0 estimators . in section [ sec : haus ]",
    "we propose a procedure ( the hausman test ) for verifying appropriate noise subtraction in pseudo-@xmath0 estimators , and we derive its analytic properties . in section [ sec : mc ]",
    "we validate our results by using monte carlo simulations , which are also used to test the power of our procedure in the presence of noise which has not been completely removed . in section",
    "[ sec : con ] we review our results and discuss directions for future research .",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuations @xmath5 can be decomposed into spherical harmonic coefficients    @xmath6    if the cmb fluctuations are gaussian distributed and statistically homogeneug , as suggested by the latest experimental results ( see for instance @xcite ) , then each @xmath7 is an independent gaussian complex variable with @xmath8and all the statistical information is contained in the power spectrum @xmath9 .    in the following",
    "we describe two procedures for estimating the cmb angular power spectrum : the standard pseudo-@xmath0 estimator , sometimes labelled the auto - power spectrum @xcite , and the cross - power spectrum . as a first step",
    ", we shall assume handling of full sky maps with isotropic , not necessarily white noise .",
    "pseudo-@xmath0 estimators are very useful in computing the power spectrum because they are fast enough to be used on large data sets such as wmap and planck .",
    "the standard pseudo-@xmath0 estimator has been thoroughly investigated in the literature , taking also into account some important features of realistic experiments such as partial sky coverage and systematic effects @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the raw pseudo - power spectrum @xmath10 defined as @xmath11where @xmath12 are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the map .    in the absence of noise and for a full sky cmb map , @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath15 ( the angular power spectrum of the signal ) with mean equal to @xmath15 and variance equal to @xmath16 ; also , @xmath17 is a @xmath18distributed variable with @xmath19 degrees of freedom .    in the presence of noise ,",
    "it is not difficult to see that this estimator is biased .",
    "if we assume , as usual , that noise is independent from the signal , we have @xmath20 and @xmath21now the common assumption is to take @xmath22 as determined _ a priori _ , for instance by monte carlo simulations and measurements of the properties of the detectors ; we shall discuss later how to test the validity of this assumption and/or make it weaker . under these circumstances ,",
    "the power spectrum estimator is naturally defined as @xmath23of course , if the estimate of the noise power spectrum @xmath22 is not correct , the estimator will be biased . for a multi - channel experiment",
    ", we generalize equation  [ basest ] by averaging the maps from each detector and then computing the power spectrum of the resulting map .",
    "a more sophisticated approach would be to use weighted averages , with weights inversely proportional to the variance of each detector , but we shall not pursue this idea for the sake of brevity . in view of equations  [ eq : dl ] and  [ basest ] , in the presence of @xmath24 channels with uncorrelated noises we can write @xmath25\\]]where @xmath26 is the detector index and @xmath27 are the noise spherical harmonics coefficients . assuming that our noise estimation is correct , we obtain for the expected value and the variance @xmath28and @xmath29 \\right\\ } \\mbox { .}\\label{mastervar}\\]]it should be noted that in equation  [ mastervar ] the value of @xmath22 is taken as fixed , and in this sense we are underestimating the variance by neglecting the additional uncertainty due to the estimation of the noise properties .",
    "the pseudo-@xmath0 estimator presented in the previous subsection is computationally very fast and simple to use , but it is prone to bias if noise has not been appropriately removed .",
    "it is thus natural to look for more robust alternatives , yielding unbiased estimates even in the presence of noise with an unknown angular power spectrum . for this purpose ,",
    "we now focus on the cross - power spectrum , which is defined , for any given couple of channels @xmath30 , as @xmath31it iss easy to show that @xmath32and @xmath33for the details of the calculations see the appendix .",
    "let us now consider the most general case with @xmath24 detectors ; this means that we can construct @xmath34 different couples of channels . for each of them we can calculate the cross - power spectrum and",
    "then take the average ; thus the cross power spectrum becomes @xmath35again , the resulting estimator is clearly unbiased , @xmath36 its covariance is given by @xmath37 \\mbox { . }",
    "\\nonumber \\label{eq : vartot}\\end{aligned}\\]]in order to evaluate this quantity , the first step is to consider the covariances among different pairs @xmath38 for @xmath24 channels we can construct @xmath39 different couples and @xmath40 covariance terms , which are @xmath41    the next step is to consider how many times we have the @xmath42 term , for each @xmath43 .",
    "this term appears when one of the two index of a couple is equal to one of the two index of another couple .",
    "this leaves @xmath44 possible values for the second index in the first couple , and @xmath45 possible values for the second index in the second couple ; finally we have a factor @xmath46 to take into account symmetries , that is , the fact that @xmath47 ( equivalently , we could drop the factor @xmath48 which multiplies the covariance terms in equation  [ eq : vartot ] ) .",
    "the result is that the single term @xmath49 appears @xmath50 times .    by plugging in equation  [ sinter ] into equation  [ eq : vartot ]",
    ", we obtain    @xmath51    it can be verified that for @xmath52 , equation  [ eq : vartot ] reduces to equation  eq : var .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with the variance of the classic pseudo-@xmath0 estimator .",
    "we can write immediately    @xmath53    considering the case where @xmath54 for all the channels , we obtain @xmath55hence , if noise has the same power spectrum over all channels , then the standard estimator is always more efficient , although clearly the difference between the two estimators becomes asymptotically negligible as the number of detectors grows ( it scales as @xmath56 .",
    "we have thus shown that the cross - power spectrum estimator provides a robust alternative to the classical pseudo-@xmath0 procedure , in that it does not require any _ a priori _ knowledge of the noise power spectrum .",
    "we shall argue that cross - power spectrum estimates can be extremely useful even if different procedures are undertaken to estimate the angular power spectrum ; indeed , in the next section we discuss how to test the assumption that noise has been appropriately removed from the data from a multi - channel experiment .",
    "in the previous section , we compared the relative efficiency of the two estimators @xmath57,@xmath58 in the case where the bias term in @xmath57 had been effectively removed . in this section",
    "we propose a testing procedure to verify the latter assumption .",
    "consider the random variable @xmath59 if @xmath57 is unbiased , then it is immediate that @xmath60 has mean zero , with variance @xmath61where @xmath62 in the appendix we show that , for a single couple @xmath63 we have @xmath64now we use equation  [ bef ] in equation  [ eq : hauscov ] and we obtain @xmath65therefore @xmath66the special case @xmath67 gives @xmath68thus , for a fixed @xmath69 we can suggest the statistic @xmath70 ^{-1/2}\\left\\ {   \\widehat{c}_{\\ell } -\\widetilde{c}_{\\ell } \\right\\}\\]]as a feasible test for the presence of bias in @xmath71 by a standard central limit theorem , we obtain that@xmath72where @xmath73 denotes convergence in distribution and @xmath74 represents a standard gaussian random variable . in words , for reasonably large @xmath69",
    "the distribution of @xmath75 is very well approximated by a gaussian , provided that @xmath57 is actually unbiased ; on the other hand , if this is not the case the expected value of @xmath75 will be non - zero .",
    "this observation suggests many possible tests for bias , using for instance the chi - square statistic @xmath76 ( a value of @xmath76 larger than 3.84 , the chi - square quantile at 95% , would suggest that bias has not been removed at that confidence level ) . in practice , however , we have to focus on many different multipoles , @xmath77 where @xmath78 depends on the resolution of the experiment and its signal to noise properties .",
    "it is clearly not enough to consider the whole sequence @xmath79 and check for the values above the threshold , as this does no longer correspond to the 95% confidence level ( it is obvious that , if @xmath80 then @xmath81 the exact value being difficult to determine ) . to combine the information over different multipoles into a single statistic in a rigorous manner , we suggest the process @xmath82}h_{\\ell } , r\\in \\lbrack 0,1]\\]]where @xmath83 $ ] denotes integer part .",
    "of course , other related proposals could be considered ; for instance we might focus on weighted versions of @xmath84 , to highlight the contribution from low multipoles , where it is well known that there are problems with non - maximum likelihood estimators .",
    "this modification , however , would not alter the substance of the discussion that follows .",

    "this means that to determine approximate threshold values for the maximum value of the sum @xmath98}h_{\\ell } $ ] as @xmath89 varies between zero and one , the tables of a standard gaussian variate are sufficient .",
    "likewise , the asymptotic distribution of @xmath99 is given by@xmath100dz \\mbox { .",
    "} \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]monte carlo simulations have confirmed that equation  [ pol1 ] and equation  [ pol2 ] provide accurate approximations of the finite sample distributions , for @xmath78 in the order of @xmath101 .",
    "in order to consider the effect of correlated noise we start discussing the simplest case with two detectors . the presence of correlated noise can be inserted by rewriting equation  [ eq : dl ] as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is independent from @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . under these circumstances , it is clear that both @xmath107 and @xmath108 will be biased ; however , their difference @xmath109 , used in the hausman test , is not affected at all due to cancellations of all the terms involving @xmath103 : @xmath110    in the more general case with @xmath24 detectors with noise correlations which varies from pair to pair , this is no longer true .",
    "in fact , by completely analogous arguments , it can be shown that some extra terms involving cross - products of the form @xmath111 will remain in @xmath109 .",
    "these terms , however , have zero expected value , and thus will affect only the variance of @xmath112 .",
    "in other words , the previous approach can go through unaltered , provided we have available a reliable estimate of the variance of @xmath109 .",

    "we leave for future research some further improvements of this approach , in particular , the use of bootstrap / resampling methods to make even the determination of confidence intervals independent from noise estimation . finally , the optimal combination of polarization power spectra and the application of the hausman test to the planck satellite are currently under investigation .",
