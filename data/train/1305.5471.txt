    "observed galaxies exhibit substantial diversity in their morphological appearances and structure .",
    "early - type , namely elliptical and lenticular , galaxies ( etgs ) are more massive on average among galaxy types and are thought to originate from mergers of late - type galaxies and smaller etgs under the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the empirical properties of etgs hold important clues to the physical processes shaping properties of the most massive galaxies .",
    "etgs also play a crucial role in modern cosmology including dark energy phenomenology .",
    "owing to their large masses and high central densities etgs dominate observed population of strong lenses and are also important for weak lensing which provide both geometric ( through cosmological distances ) and dynamical ( through growth of structures ) probe of dark energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "massive etgs , or similarly luminous red galaxies by colour selection , are also excellent targets of the baryonic acoustic oscillation studies that provide an independent cosmological probe of the distance scale in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for both astrophysical and cosmological studies involving etgs , their density structure , in particular the radial profile ,",
    "is of great importance for several reasons .",
    "first of all , as the radial mass profile encodes the combined distribution of luminous and dark matter , it is a key quantity to constrain galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "an important question is whether there is a simple natural attractor of radial density profile such as the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the isothermal profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , because there is no empirical method to directly measure dark matter ( dm ) distribution in a galaxy , accurate determination of the total mass profile is the crucial first step toward the inference of dm distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the radial mass profile is a crucial factor in gravitational lensing ( both strong and weak ) .",
    "strong lensing image flux ratios depend largely on the radial density slope at the einstein radius .",
    "weak lensing by individual haloes and large - scale structures depend on the global radial profile of galaxies and clusters .",
    "the radial total mass profile of a galaxy can be constrained using dynamic probes such as stellar or gas dynamics , or gravitational lensing . for nearby etgs stellar dynamics",
    "has been the most fruitful probe because detailed stellar kinematic data as well as photometric data are available .",
    "detailed dynamical models based on the observed luminosity distributions and stellar velocity moments have been constructed for tens to hundreds etgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for nearby @xmath9-ray bright massive ellipticals ,",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium equation has been used to infer mass profiles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred mass profiles from these studies in general exhibit significant variation of the logarithmic slope with radius , although the density profiles are close to isothermal around the half - light radius of stellar distribution . nevertheless , the sample sizes of dynamical and lensing studies of mass distribution in the etgs have been fairly small to allow systematic study of profile variation in a wide radial range .",
    "strong lensing studies have been used to constrain the total mass profile of distant galaxies at various redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "strong lensing effectively constrains the density slope ( absolute value ) @xmath10 or , more precisely , the slope of the projected 2-dimensional density @xmath11 , at the einstein radius @xmath12 , which increases with redshift at fixed @xmath2 : e.g. , @xmath13 at @xmath14 but @xmath15 at @xmath16 ( @xcite ) . for systematic analyses of samples of tens of strong lens systems constant-@xmath17 models have usually been adopted and the constrained values of @xmath17 have mean slopes close to the isothermal value @xmath18 for @xmath19 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , recently it was noticed that the value of @xmath17 appeared to evolve significantly with @xmath20 based on combined samples that contain both low @xmath21 lenses and intermediate @xmath22 lenses ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath17 was independent of radius in the optical region , the apparent redshift evolution of @xmath17 was interpreted in terms of galaxy evolution .",
    "notably , the apparent evolution implies @xmath23 at @xmath24 ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , stellar dynamics , strong and weak lensing were combined to infer the total mass profile for a large radial range for several individual systems ( @xcite ) or stacked data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the former work focused on galaxy clusters , while the latter study used only the de  vaucouleurs stellar mass profile and the nfw dm profile without taking into account halo contraction effects by baryonic physics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    from recent dynamical analyses of etgs",
    "it is not clear whether the isothermal model is a good approximation to the average profile for some radial range or whether the average profile is systematically varying with redshift or some other parameter .",
    "here we investigate galaxy mass profile through jeans dynamical analyses based on sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) galactic luminosity distributions and aperture velocity dispersions in conjunction with published velocity dispersion profiles and empirical properties and relations for etgs and their haloes .",
    "sdss photometric data and aperture velocity dispersions have been useful in addressing several issues including estimating dynamical masses and dark matter contents within @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , testing halo contraction / expansion models and stellar initial mass functions ( imfs ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies confirm that non - negligible amount of dark matter is generally required within @xmath2 and suggest that the dm fraction within @xmath2 is correlated with properties such as surface brightness and @xmath2 and galaxies require non - universal imfs or / and non - universal dark halo response to galaxy formation .",
    "our present study of sdss etgs has the following aspects .",
    "first , we select nearly spherical and disk - less galaxies for our analyses by the spherical jeans equation so that any possible systematic errors due to non - spherical shapes , which were ignored in all previous analyses , can be minimized .",
    "second , the main focus of our work is galaxy total mass profile and for that purpose we use an empirical distribution of velocity dispersion profiles ( vps ) within @xmath2 .",
    "third , we use newly measured luminosity profile parameters , sersic index @xmath25 and effective radius @xmath2 .",
    "fourth , we take into account recently published systematic imf variation in early - type galaxies . finally , our analyses are based on real data and auxiliary empirical inputs excluding simulation or theoretical inputs .",
    "our present work has a different focus and is an improvement with updated and more reliable inputs compared with @xcite which considered vps but focused on dm profiles with inputs from n - body simulations .    for our jeans analyses we assume parametric functional forms for the total mass profile .",
    "when a model is fitted to the aperture velocity dispersion , it predicts a velocity dispersion profile .",
    "we then compare the predicted distribution of vps with the empirical distribution to test the model .",
    "our successful models are two - component models in which stellar mass distribution is assumed to follow the photometrically derived luminosity profile and the coupled dm distribution is assumed to follow the gnfw or einasto model , which are motivated from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation , with the constraint that they match weak lensing observations at large radii .",
    "our model set is at least an order of magnitude larger than any previous set of empirical ( as opposed to simulation or semi - empirical ) models for etgs .",
    "in addition , it covers a large radial range extending from @xmath26 to the halo virial radius .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe our data and other empirical results from the literature that are needed for our analyses . in section  3",
    "we describe mass model parametrisation and method of jeans dynamical analyses . in section  4",
    "we describe statistical results for mass profiles based on standard empirical inputs and then in section  5 we consider systematic variations of the statistical results . in section  6",
    "we compare our results with recent results based on sdss photometric data and aperture velocity dispersions . in sections  7 & 8 we discuss implications of our results for galaxy formation and strong lensing .",
    "we conclude in section  9 .",
    "we carefully define a sample of nearly spherical ( projected minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath27 ) and disk - less ( disk mass is within the measurement error of total mass ) galaxies with mean redshift @xmath28 selected from the sdss ( @xcite ) .",
    "this selection excludes all lenticular and later - type galaxies , while retaining galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass ( @xmath29 ) , and was chosen to minimize biases in analyses based on the spherical jeans equation ( see section  3 ) .",
    "therefore , our resulting mass profiles will apply strictly to nearly spherical galaxies only .",
    "however , we will also consider modelling a general sample of etgs to estimate any systematic difference in mass profile between our nearly spherical sample and a general sample .    because each galaxy in our sample has a nearly spherical component only ,",
    "its luminosity profile can generally be well described by a single - component @xcite profile , except possibly for the sub - kiloparsec central region ( see below ) .",
    "each galaxy has the surface brightness srsic - fit effective radius @xmath2 , the srsic index @xmath25 , the luminosity - weighted line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( losvd ) within the sdss aperture of radius 1.5  arcsec @xmath30 and the total stellar mass @xmath31 converted from the measured luminosity using the chabrier(@xcite ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) or equivalently mass - to - light ( @xmath32 ) ratio .",
    "recent observational studies have found that imfs of etgs are not universal but show galaxy - to - galaxy scatter and systematic trends with some parameters such as stellar velocity dispersion ( vd ) @xmath33 . to encompass the current likely range we use three independently inferred @xmath33-dependent imfs ( e.g. , @xcite ; see section  2.3 ) .",
    "it is well - known that the central sub - kiloparsec region of etg light profile exhibits large variation giving rise to either the central missing light due to the shallower core or the central extra light due to the steeper power - law profile compared with the main body profile extrapolation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this central extra or missing light can have non - negligible effects for small @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "however , sdss photometric data do not have enough resolution for the central regions of our @xmath34 galaxies . to allow for the observed deviations in the central regions from the overall srsic profiles for etgs we use the central profile properties , i.e.  the break radius and the slope at a fiducial central radius as a function of stellar mass , extracted from published data including the _ hubble space telescope _ data ( see section  2.8 ) .",
    "each galaxy is further assigned its halo mass @xmath35 within the virial radius @xmath36 , which is defined to be the radius of the sphere within which the mean density is 200 times the cosmic mean matter density ( equation  6 of @xcite ) , @xmath37 assuming a flat @xmath38-dominated universe with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xcite ) .",
    "for this we use the empirical @xmath41-@xmath35 relations from sdss satellite kinematics ( @xcite ) and weak lensing ( @xcite ) , as well as the abundance matching relation ( @xcite ) to encompass the current likely range ( see section  2.4 ) .",
    "the halo assigned to each galaxy is then assigned a mass profile at large radii ( @xmath42 ) using the weak lensing observations of the sdss galaxies , which not only show that the outer halo profile can be well described by the nfw profile but also give the mean halo mass ( @xmath35)-nfw concentration ( @xmath43 ) relation derived from stacked profiles ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use an intrinsic scatter of @xmath44  dex and allow @xmath45 of systematic errors .    to constrain the mass profile in the optical region of each nearly spherical galaxy we need not only the aperture vd @xmath30 but also the vd profile .",
    "we do not have a measured vd profile for each galaxy in our sample .",
    "however , we can use an empirical statistical distribution of vd profiles from the literature ( @xcite ) as described in section  2.6 .    in the following subsections",
    "we describe in detail our data and all empirical results from the literature that are needed for our analyses .      to describe the observed light distribution of an etg we use the srsic model or a two - component ( ` serexp ' ) model that contains a srsic bulge and an exponential disk . from the light distribution we derive the volume distribution of stellar mass using",
    "empirically derived stellar imfs ( see below section  2.3 ) .",
    "the srsic surface brightness distribution on the sky given by @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( @xmath48 being the two dimensional radius ) and @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 ) ( @xcite ) allows a more accurate description of a dispersion - supported system than the traditional de  vaucouleurs model which is the special case of @xmath51 .",
    "more recently it has been recognized that most etgs are better described by a compound model composed of two distinct components , namely a bulge and a disk , although the bulge is dominating ( @xcite ) .",
    "when a two - component system with the non - negligible disk is fitted by a single srsic model , the resulting parameters , in particular galaxy size @xmath2 , can be biased compared with the actual bulge parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bias in @xmath2 is less than 0.05  dex for stellar mass @xmath52 but can be as large as 0.08  dex near the high mass tail ( @xcite ) .    for our jeans analyses",
    "we select nearly spherical and disk - less systems that are well - described by the single - component srsic profiles ( see , however , section  2.8 for the profiles of the central sub - kpc regions ) .",
    "however , we also consider modelling general etgs to estimate possible systematic difference of our results from those for general etgs . in this case",
    "we use the single srsic fit to the total light distribution .",
    "when we use the single srsic fit for a galaxy having a non - negligible disk , we are using a biased @xmath2 as mentioned above .",
    "we select a sample of 28,259 etgs from the sdss main galaxy sample satisfying light concentration @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the ratio of the radius containing 90 percent of the petrosian luminosity in the @xmath56-band to that containing 50 percent ( @xcite ) and @xmath57 is the bulge srsic index in the serexp fit of the total light distribution .",
    "a subsample of 20,210 etgs satisfies @xmath58 .",
    "each galaxy in the sample has aperture velocity dispersion @xmath30 and ellipticity @xmath59 ( @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the projected minor - to - major axis ratio ) as well as fitted parameters of both the srsic and the serexp models along with corresponding stellar masses based on the chabrier imf .",

    "( 16,8)(0,0 ) ( -0.5,10.5 )    based on the observed light distributions and the model fitted parameters we select a @xmath58 subsample of 2,054 nearly spherical and disk - less ellipticals using the criteria @xmath64 ( single srsic - fit ellipticity ) and @xmath65 ( the sum of the estimated measurement errors for @xmath2 in the single srsic fit and @xmath63 in the serexp fit ) .",
    "galaxies in this sample have the following properties @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "( see further section  6 . )",

    "other samples will be used to estimate systematic errors of galaxy sampling . in particular",
    ", we also consider a @xmath53 subsample of 2,607 nearly spherical and disk - less ellipticals to see the effects of varying the etg selection criterion .",

    "furthermore , stellar imfs are not universal as described in section  2.3 .",
    "hence stellar mass is relatively more uncertain than other parameters and should be treated with caution .",
    "the aperture velocity dispersion @xmath30 has the smallest error and is the most reliable parameter out of our measurements .",
    "a number of recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) find that the stellar imfs for etgs show significant galaxy - to - galaxy scatter and are in general different from the imfs inferred for the milky way and other nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the stellar masses derived for our galaxies using the chabrier imf should be corrected .",

    "the important points are as follows :",
    "1 .   _ the spherical symmetry assumption and galaxy sample choice _ : we have a large number of galaxies selected by @xmath55 , but empirical information for each galaxy is relatively limited compared with well - studied local etgs ( e.g.  @xcite ) . because of the limit of our data we have assumed the spherical symmetry .",
    "we have then selected nearly spherical galaxies ( @xmath167 ) to minimize the error arising from the spherical symmetry assumption . in reality ,",
    "even nearly spherical galaxies have in some cases non - negligible disk components in their light distributions .",
    "because the presence of non - negligible disk components can invalidate the spherical symmetry assumption , we have further narrowed our selection by rejecting galaxies that have non - negligible disks .",
    "our final sample of 2,054 nearly spherical , disk - less and @xmath168 galaxies can be legitimately modelled relying on the spherical symmetry assumption .",
    "+ however , there still remain a couple of issues .",
    "first , as we are modelling nearly spherical and disk - less galaxies only , our results may not hold for the general population of etgs .",
    "for example , it is possible that intrinsic shapes of galaxies can increase the intrinsic scatter of the mass profile .",
    "+ second , all auxiliary empirical properties of etgs ( e.g.  the imf distribution , the @xmath169 relation , the distributions of @xmath170 and @xmath103 ) are for general populations of etgs or red galaxies .",
    "if these properties are systematically different for spherical galaxies , then our results will be biased .",
    "however , we do not find any systematic difference between all etgs and nearly spherical etgs based on the literature data ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ vpdist ] for the case of @xmath103 ) . + as a way of estimating the systematic effects of non - spherical shapes we consider two samples of random etgs .",
    "one sample is drawn randomly from the @xmath58 sample and the other sample from a sample with a relaxed criterion of @xmath53 .",
    "we also consider a @xmath171 sample of nearly spherical and disk - less galaxies to see the pure effects of changing the @xmath55 criterion .",
    "the results for the random @xmath58 sample ( fit #  3 in table  2 ) have almost the same mean values of the slopes @xmath103 and @xmath172 compared with the standard nearly spherical and disk - less sample ( fit #  1 ) but have larger scatters in good agreement with the observed scatters for random etgs . the @xmath171 samples ( fit #  4 & #  5 ) have shallower mean slopes and larger scatters .",
    "in particular , the predicted values of the mean vp slope @xmath6 are marginally discrepant with the empirical value @xmath173 . moreover , the random @xmath171 sample ( fit #  5 ) has larger scatter than observed .",
    "the assumption of parametric functional forms for dm distribution _ : one of our underlying assumption is that the unknown dm distribution varies smoothly in radius and can be modelled by parametric functional forms motivated by @xmath94-body simulations combined with baryonic effects . because it is an empirical fact that the outer halo where baryonic effects are negligible follows well the nfw functional form",
    ", we chose the gnfw model with a generalized central slope as our standard model . to see possible systematic errors of this assumption we also consider the einasto model that is equally well motivated .",
    "we have checked that contracted haloes due to baryonic effects produced by state - of - the - art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations can be well approximated by the gnfw or the einasto profile , as can be checked numerically using the contra code ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that if baryon - induced halo contraction effects are real , our models can mimic those effects .",
    "also , note that our models can mimic effects of halo expansion as well if that occurs ( for some galaxies ) .",
    "the result based on the the einasto model ( fit #  6 ) has somewhat shallower mean slopes compared with the standard result ( fit #  1 ) based on the gnfw model and interestingly larger scatter .",
    "although the scatter of @xmath103 is more consistent with the observed scatter than the standard result , the mean @xmath6 is marginally shallower than the observed mean .",
    "3 .   _ various empirical inputs _ : we consider alternative choices of various empirical inputs , fit #  7  #  14 in table  2 .",
    "the largest possible systematic differences are @xmath174-@xmath124 in @xmath6 and @xmath175-@xmath176 in @xmath5 arising from the @xmath88-@xmath35 relation and the @xmath35-@xmath43 relation .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the result using wildly varying vd anisotropies based on equation  [ eq : varbet ] has unchanging mean slopes but have almost twice larger scatter in @xmath103 ( @xmath177 compared with @xmath178 ) while keeping the scatter in @xmath172 nearly unchanged .",
    "this shows that anisotropy shapes can only affect the scatter of @xmath103 but probably not the mean slopes .",
    "_ correlations among empirical input parameters _ :",
    "in our approach each galaxy with measured parameter values ( @xmath30 which is on average closest to @xmath105 , @xmath2 , @xmath25 , @xmath88 ) is assigned various other parameter values [ imf variation with respect to the chabrier imf expressed in terms of @xmath179 , halo mass @xmath35 , outer halo profile concentration expressed using the nfw profile @xmath43 , anisotropy @xmath170 ( and velocity dispersion profile slope @xmath103 for the chi - square approach ) ] using observed two - parameter relations including intrinsic scatter based on a wealth of empirical information . however , we ignored any possible multiple correlations among input parameters . here ,",
    "we examine / discuss possible correlations and investigate how the mass profile results are affected .",

    "our results are also somewhat steeper than , but consistent at a @xmath196 level with , the slacs results ( e.g.  @xcite ) : constant slope @xmath201 with @xmath202 ( @xcite ) . however , unlike the @xcite result quoted above this result is for redshift range of @xmath203 . as is discussed by @xcite and in section  8 below",
    ", the inferred @xmath17 may depend on the redshift range , so that caution should be taken in comparing the slacs results with our result .",
    "sdss aperture velocity dispersions and photometric data have been widely used in the literature to infer dynamical masses and dark matter fractions in the optical region ( e.g.  @xcite ) and to test halo contraction / expansion models and stellar imfs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been found that the sdss data require non - universal imfs and/or non - universal halo response to baryonic physics ( @xcite ) . however ,",
    "none of these studies have tried to predict mass profiles or considered velocity dispersion profiles , although @xcite have used the slacs mass profile slope distribution ( @xmath204 , @xmath205 ; @xcite ) to further study imfs and halo response .",
    "@xcite argue that for massive ellipticals with mean @xmath206 similar to the slacs systems , uncontracted nfw haloes combined with the salpeter imf can reproduce the slacs slope distribution .",
    "however , their argument depends on two assumptions that the slacs slope distribution at higher redshifts can match low-@xmath20 sdss galaxies and the fiducial stellar mass based on the chabrier imf is correct ( remember that @xmath88 itself is uncertain as mentioned in section  2.2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the @xcite result differs by just @xmath99 from our best estimate and is within our systematic errors ( cf .",
    "table  2 ) .",
    "in particular , it appears that if one fully considers realistic systematic errors halo contraction effects are inconclusive yet largely due to uncertainties in stellar masses involving imfs ( in preparation ) .",
    "recently a jeans analysis of etgs has been carried out by @xcite based on abundance matching between sdss etgs and the bolshoi @xmath94-body simulation haloes ( @xcite ) and previously available statistical empirical properties of etgs .",
    "the focus of that analysis was to compare the resulting dm profile ( baryonic effects included ) with the dm - only @xmath94-body simulation profile .",
    "a by - product was that mass profile slope values measured at @xmath207 were on average close to isothermal .",
    "this is in contradiction with our steeper - than - isothermal profiles presented above .",
    "specifically , for the case of using the same abundance matching @xmath88-@xmath35 relation our new result @xmath208 ( fit #  10 , table  2 ) is steeper than @xmath209 ( the lower red point in fig .",
    "[ etagam ] ) for a total of 3,000 etgs ( 1,000 etgs respectively of @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 ) .",
    "several factors can account for this difference .",
    "first of all , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nser ] our newly measured values of srsic index @xmath25 are higher than the previously adopted values ( @xcite ) for @xmath213 .",
    "this is in part due to the difference in sample definitions .",
    "the @xcite sample includes low concentration spheroidal galaxies at low stellar masses while our sample includes only high concentration ( i.e.  @xmath58 ) galaxies . when the semi - empirical approach is carried out with our new distribution of @xmath25 for all etgs ( green curve ) and the atlas@xmath77 imf distribution we have a higher @xmath214 ( the upper red point in fig .",
    "[ etagam ] ) .    the remaining difference of @xmath175 can be attributed to other factors including differences in the posterior distribution of parameters ( in particular @xmath2 ) and their correlations owing to the different modelling procedure . in particular",
    ", in the semi - empirical approach the posterior distribution of @xmath103 always had a mean shallower than @xmath215 and was tried to approximately match @xmath216 .",
    "[ etagam ] shows that the revised semi - empirical result falls right on the empirical @xmath6@xmath5 line while the original result deviates somewhat . in other words",
    ", whatever factors contributed to the difference in @xmath5 it can be explained by the difference in the posterior value of @xmath6 .    despite the large difference in @xmath5 we find that total mass profiles from the semi - empirical analysis show similar curvature in the mean density slope profiles .",
    "the radial systematic pattern of each mass profile ( fig .",
    "[ rhogamex ] , fig .  [ rhogam ] ) and the systematic variation of the characteristic slopes ( fig .  [ gamvar ] ) as a function of some parameters ,",
    "in particular the size and the projected effective surface density , implies that there is no natural attractor or strict conspiracy for total mass profiles of etgs .",
    "the isothermal model is good only as a constant - slope approximation to the mean inner halo of the etg population .",
    "etgs are complex systems of luminous and dark matter and the interplay between them may create super - isothermal and sub - isothermal regions .",
    "when predictions of galaxy formation theories are compared with observed galaxies , the same radial ranges should be used and more importantly radially varying slopes may need to be considered .",
    "the tight correlation between total mass and stellar vd slopes shown in fig .  [ etagam ] is reminiscent of the pseudo phase - space density profile for dm distribution produced by @xmath94-body simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "a universal power - law behaviour of the pseudo - phase - space density of dm ( @xcite ) given by @xmath217 ( @xmath218 ) implies @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the vd in the 3-dimensional physical space , @xmath221 , and @xmath222 .",
    "a different slope of @xmath223 in our relation @xmath224 can be attributed to the fact that @xmath6 is for the losvd . indeed , if we consider radial stellar vd @xmath225 ( cf .",

    "[ etagam ] shows distributions of @xmath172 ( total mass absolute slope within @xmath2 ) and @xmath227 ( @xmath225 slope within @xmath2 ) for our fiducial model .",
    "there is some intrinsic scatter but the least - square fit linear relation is @xmath228 and @xmath229 for the fixed slope of @xmath230 which are very similar to the above relation for dm .",
    "this implies that there may exist a universal profile of pseudo phase - space density - like quantities in any collisionless components in dynamical equilibria ( @xcite ) .",
    "radially varying mass profiles of etgs call for a careful interpretation of gravitational lensing , in particular strong lensing .",
    "strong lensing depends on the projected 2-dimensional density slope @xmath11 at the einstein radius @xmath12 .",
    "the redshift evolution of @xmath12 in conjunction with the radial variation of the density slope ( fig .",
    "[ rhogam ] ) can produce an apparent redshift evolution of a mass profile from an analysis of a strong lensing sample .",
    "let us make a quantitative prediction based on a strong lens sample recently analysed by @xcite .",
    "the observed mean ratio @xmath231 evolves from @xmath232 at @xmath233 to @xmath234 at @xmath235 with a slope @xmath236 while @xmath237 remains nearly unchanged ( @xcite ) . according to our results for etg mass profiles the mean density slope @xmath238 varies as @xmath239 between @xmath240 and @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ rhogam ] ) , which gives @xmath241 .",
    "suppose we are using a constant - slope model for the lensing galaxy to fit the lensed image geometry and magnification ratios , then we would get @xmath242 ( note that for the constant slope profile @xmath243 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this evolution is consistent ( within @xmath99 ) with the reported evolution @xmath244 from a combined analysis of strong lensing and stellar dynamics using a constant - slope model ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is unclear whether this means the reported evolution is an artefact due to the radially varying slope or real because it was also based on stellar dynamics .",
    "however , our results indicate that it is possible that the reported evolution is due , at least in part , to the radially varying slope",

    "assembling statistically significant numbers of mass models of sdss concentration - selected elliptical galaxies we find the following :    * two - component mass models reproduce simultaneously the aperture velocity dispersion and the observed velocity dispersion profile slope distribution , but single - component mass models with constant or monotonically varying slope can not successfully predict the observed velocity dispersion profile slope distribution without biasing the aperture velocity dispersion .",
