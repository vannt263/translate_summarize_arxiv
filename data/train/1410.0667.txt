    "the irregularities in the earth s rotation axis direction and norm originate in various complex phenomena such as interaction with solar system bodies , mass redistribution in the oceans and the atmosphere , as well as interactions between the various internal layers ( see @xcite , figure [ fig : poleyear ] and figure [ fig : j2 ] ) . +    0.45    0.45     in order to take into account these irregularities , classical models of earth s dynamics are constructed on geophysical considerations such as oceans and atmosphere dynamics and the earth s neighborhood like the moon , the planets and the sun ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in these models , the short time ( diurnal and subdiurnal time - scale ) irregularities",
    "are badly modeled due to the complexity of the phenomena ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . with this problem ,",
    "we are led to the following question : _ is an alternative approach of earth s rotation model possible ? _ + the complex mechanisms underlying the irregularities in the earth s rotation strongly suggest modeling the earth s rotation , over short time scales , with random processes .",
    "indeed , the short time variations of the _ rotation speed _ , _ length of the day _ and _ polar motion _ are strongly correlated with the time variations in the dynamics of the ocean and the atmosphere , for periods of order between the day and the year .",
    "it has been observed that these short time variations seem to be of stochastic nature ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this induces strong changes in the modeling process .",
    "an example of such considerations is the two - body problem with a stochastic perturbation studied in @xcite . up to now",
    ", the stochastic behavior has been taken into account using _ filtering theory _ which consists in adding noises governed by constants and adjust them to best estimate the observations ( see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such a method , although effective , can not be used to determine how a given stochastic perturbation impacts the other quantities of interest .",
    "indeed , the form of the stochastic process is not explicitly related to the physical parameters entering in the physical process as the experimental data mix phenomenon of different origins .",
    "+ in this work , we model an oblate homogeneous ellipsoid of revolution , which could represent the earth , whose geometric flattening is varying and contains a stochastic component .",
    "we use the framework of stochastic differential equations in the sense of it .",
    "the major difference with an approach through filtering theory is that we are looking for a physical phenomenon linked to the ellipsoid itself by explicit formula .",
    "this allows us to identify the influence of the stochastic term on the stochastic variation of the flattening , which is responsible of the stochastic behavior observed in the zonal harmonic @xmath0 and the length of the day .",
    "precisely , we obtain explicit formulas relating the stochastic variation of the geometric flattening to the stochastic fluctuation of the dynamical flattening and the second zonal harmonic ( see proposition [ h_drift ] and lemma [ j2_drift ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the expected interactions between these different phenomenon , in particular for what concerns the length of the day .",
    "+ it must be noted that adding a stochastic contribution to a known deterministic model is not easy .",
    "at least two difficulties must be overcome :    * first , one must find expressions of quantities of interest which can be computed in the stochastic setting . in our case",
    ", we are concerned with adding random fluctuations of the ellipsoid shape to an existing deterministic models .",
    "a non exhaustive list of models are given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as a first approach , we restrict our attention to the euler - liouville equation ( see section [ det_eq_motion ] ) . *",
    "second , one must be careful with the stochastic component entering in the geometric flattening .",
    "indeed , without any assumptions , a stochastic process induces unbounded fluctuations leading to unrealistic values .",
    "then , one must construct an `` admissible '' stochastic deformation having bounded variations with probability one ( see section [ adm_stoc_def ] ) .",
    "another difficulty deserves to be mentioned and concerns the numerical study of such kind of models . indeed",
    ", classical numerical schemes do not preserve in general the specific constraints of a model .",
    "for example , the usual euler - maruyama scheme destroys the invariance condition used to construct admissible stochastic deformations , leading to inconsistent results , even for a short time simulation .",
    "this can be overcome using an appropriate time step during the numerical integration ( see section [ num_inv ] and @xcite ) . + the plan of this paper is as follows : + in section 2 , we remind the classical equations of motion for a rigid ellipsoid .",
    "section 3 deals with the case of an ellipsoid with a time variable flattening : deterministic or stochastic .",
    "in particular we discuss the notion of admissible deformations based on the invariance criterion for ( stochastic ) differential equations .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the numerical exploration of a toy - model obtained by a particular deformation equation of the flattening . in section 5",
    "we conclude and give some perspectives .",

    "of course it is possible to adapt all the theoretical and numerical results of this work in such a situation and moreover with a body having a general shape .",
    "+ obviously the hypothesis on the stochastic nature of the deformation which should be a diffusion process seems to be too restrictive . indeed ,",
    "the real data suggest there is sometimes noise coloration ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . of course it is also possible to adapt all the results of this work with colored noise ( see @xcite and @xcite for example for a short introduction to colored noise using the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and its white noise limit ) .",
    "testing such a model with the real data and colored noise and also the actual model of the main perturbation of earth s rotation such as the oceanic and atmospheric excitation will be the subject of a future paper .",
