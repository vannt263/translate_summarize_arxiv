    "the distribution of dark matter in galaxies has been a source of debate in the scientific community , with one of the main sources of uncertainty being the `` disc - halo degeneracy '' ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van albada et al . 1985 ) ) .",
    "this degeneracy arises because rotation curve decompositions depend critically on the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l or @xmath3 ) which is assigned to the stellar disc component .",
    "rotation curves can be fit equally well with barely any disc contribution , or where the disc contributes the maximum amount possible  also known as the `` maximum disc hypothesis '' ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van albada et al . 1985 ) ,",
    "* sackett 1997 ) ) .",
    "there is no conclusive evidence to either prove or disprove the maximum disc hypothesis and in fact there are a number of arguments both for and against it for the milky - way ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * sackett 2003 ) ) as well as for external galaxies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "* kranz et al . 2003 ) ) .",
    "a way to break the degeneracy between the disc and the dark matter halo is by obtaining dynamical estimates of the m / l ratio of the disc .",
    "one way to do this is via the non - axisymmetries induced by the bar , which shocks the gas and leads to the well known `` dust lanes '' observed in barred galaxies ( ( * ? ? ? *",
    "prendergast 1983 ) ) .",
    "these shocks can be reproduced in hydrodynamic simulations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* athanassoula 1992 ) ) , and their morphology is dependent on the m / l of the disc , the bar pattern speed and the height function of the disc .    in this study",
    "we examine the dust lanes present in the nearby galaxy ngc  1291 , and aim to reproduce their morphology using hydrodynamic gas response simulations .",
    "the major assumption of this method for obtaining the m / l is that the halo is axisymmetric , and that all the non - axisymmetry in the potential is due to the stellar component .",
    "there are three main free parameters in the models , and we vary these parameters in order to explore the allowed parameter space .",
    "this leads to more than 300 simulations , from which the best fit models are obtained according to how well the shock loci in the models match those in the observations .",
    "this is done by placing pseudo - slits perpendicular to the shocks , as shown in figure [ fig : mod005_slit ] .",
    "the three free parameters are varied as follows :    . to obtain the potential we use a 3.6@xmath4 image of ngc  1291 from the s@xmath5 g survey ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sheth et al . 2010 ) ) to which we apply a m / l .",
    "we assume a fiducial value of @xmath6=0.6@xmath1 for the 3.6@xmath7 m band ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* meidt et al . 2014 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* roeck et al . 2015 ) ) , colour corrected to account for the presence of dust by combining information from the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath7 m images ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eskew et al . 2012 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* querejeta et al . 2015 ) ) .",
    "we then vary the m / l from 1.5 to 0.25 @xmath6 in steps of 0.25 and add a dark matter halo which maintains the total rotation curve flat at a value of 220km / s ( see figure [ fig : rots ] ) as found from the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mcgaugh et al . 2000 ) ) .    .",
    "by varying the lagrangian radius while keeping all the other parameters of a model constant , we effectively vary the pattern speed of the bar .",
    "the lagrangian radius is varied between 1 and 2 times the bar semi - major axis , in steps of 0.2 .    .",
    "we vary the height function of the disc by assuming two functional forms  isothermal and exponential  and we also vary the scaleheight from @xmath8=0.5 to @xmath8=1.5kpc .",
    ": the best fit models obtained in this study have a m / l in the range of m / l@xmath9=0.6 - 0.75 which falls within the range predicted by stellar population synthesis models and other approaches ( i.e. @xmath6=0.6m@xmath10/l@xmath10 by e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* meidt et al . ( 2014 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* roeck et al . ( 2015 ) ) ) .",
    "it is important to note that our results are independent of systematic uncertainties such as the choice of imf .    :",
    "the best fit models have borderline a maximal disc on average , with the disc contributing ( on average ) 74% of the total rotation velocity .",
    "it is worth noting that we are using the definition of sackett ( 1997 ) for disc maximality , which examines the rotation velocity at 2.2@xmath11 ; in this context , and because the scalelength of ngc  1291 is unusually large ( 5.8kpc ) , we are examining the rotation velocity at a radius of almost 13kpc . therefore , even for cases where the disc is not according to this definition `` maximal '' , the stellar disc dominates the rotation curve in the inner regions of the galaxy .    :",
    "it s furthermore important to note that for this galaxy , models with exponential scaleheights lead to sub maximal discs , while models with an isothermal scaleheight lead to maximal discs .",
    "this indicates that the choice of height function , especially for such borderline cases , can affect whether we obtain a maximal disc or not .",
    "additionally , the scaleheight affects the results , as was already shown in previous works , such as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fragkoudi et al . ( 2015 ) ) , where we showed the important effect a boxy / peanut height function can have on the models .    :",
    "the best fit models have fast rotating bars with @xmath12 @xmath2 1.4 .",

    "* elmegreen 1996 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
