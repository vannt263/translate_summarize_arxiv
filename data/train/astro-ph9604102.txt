    "the origin of lithium and other light elements is still an unsolved problem in astrophysics .",
    "it is widely accepted that @xmath0li isotopes are produced during the big bang and by `` spallation '' reactions in the interstellar medium by galactic cosmic rays or in flares ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "standard big bang nucleosynthesis underproduces @xmath0li with respect to solar by more than an order of magnitude ( see however the recent paper by @xcite ) , whereas spallation reactions by galactic cosmic rays , produce @xmath0li and @xmath1li simultaneously , as well as @xmath2be , @xmath3b and @xmath4b .",
    "these two mechanisms are unable to account alone for the present @xmath0li abundance ( @xmath0li /h @xmath5 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , they are unable to produce neither the high isotopic ratio @xmath0li /@xmath1li observed in the solar system ( @xmath0li /@xmath1li = 12.5 @xmath6 0.2 ) nor the @xmath4b/@xmath3b one ( @xmath4b/@xmath3b@xmath5 4 ) .",
    "recent measurements of the lithium isotopic ratio in the interstellar medium ( @xcite , @xcite ) yield values similar to those found in the solar system , indicating that it has remained nearly constant or even decreased during the last 4.55 gyr . the contribution of a low energy component of the galactic cosmic rays , confined at the source or by stellar flares ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) can account for the boron isotopes but @xmath0li is still underproduced . therefore , an extra stellar source able to produce this @xmath0li without generating @xmath1li has to be invoked",
    ". the interplay of these sources in the galactic evolution of lithium has been extensively studied ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the synthesis of @xmath0li by a stellar source requires the formation of @xmath0be which transforms into @xmath0li by an electron capture , being @xmath0be half ",
    "life 53.3 days .",
    "as @xmath0li is very easily destroyed , @xmath0be has to be transported to zones cooler than those where it was formed with a time scale shorter than its decay time . this _ beryllium transport _ mechanism , as first suggested by @xcite , requires a dynamic situation , like that encountered in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and novae .",
    "another possibility is the production of lithium and boron isotopes by neutrino induced synthesis , during gravitational supernova explosions ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of such a mechanism is still a matter of debate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the production of lithium in agb stars has been extensively studied and these stars represent the unique observational evidence of an autogenic stellar origin , since it has been observed in them ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the huge abundances of lithium found in some agb stars are a clear proof that these stars are currently injecting important quantities of lithium to the interstellar medium .",
    "however it is hard to estimate their total contribution , since it depends on the estimated number of such stars , that are buried by their own wind ( @xcite ) .",
    "the production of @xmath0li in explosive hydrogen burning and , in particular , in accreting white dwarfs exploding as classical novae , was first studied with a parametrized one  zone model by @xcite .",
    "later on @xcite computed the @xmath0li yields by means of a hydrodynamic code .",
    "this code simulated the explosive stage of novae , without considering the accretion phase , i.e. , with an initial envelope already in place .",
    "the conclusion of this work was that , depending on the initial abundance of @xmath7he and on the treatment of convection , @xmath0li could be formed in substantial amounts during explosive hydrogen  burning in novae .",
    "this problem has been revisited by @xcite . on the basis of an extended nuclear reaction network and of updated nuclear reaction rates , but adopting again a parametrized one - zone model , they showed that @xmath0li could only be produced in significant amounts at peak densities lower than 10@xmath7g.@xmath8 , which are lower than those predicted by hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "they argued that the reason of the discrepancy was the neglect of the @xmath9b(p,@xmath10c reaction in the calculations of @xcite .",
    "however , large overproductions of @xmath0be were found by @xcite ( using the semi  analytical model of @xcite to obtain the temperature and density profiles and a complete reaction network that included @xmath9b(p,@xmath10c ) showing that the origin of the different results was not that reaction .",
    "in fact , @xcite also showed by means of a two ",
    "zone approximation that the efficiency of mixing by convection is a very critical parameter , and they stressed the need of a detailed hydrodynamic model to study @xmath0li production more accurately .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to compute the synthesis of @xmath0li in both carbon oxygen ( co ) and oxygen  neon  magnesium ( onemg ) novae by means of an implicit hydrodynamic code , that includes a full reaction network , able to treat both the hydrostatic accretion phase and the explosion stage . an estimation of the contribution of novae to galactic enrichment is made , on the basis of the overproductions and ejected masses obtained .",
    "the importance of the initial chemical composition of the envelope is analyzed .",
    "the detection of @xmath0li in novae would confirm our theoretical predicition .",
    "furthermore , the detection of gamma  ray emission at 478 kev , corresponding to the decay of @xmath0be to @xmath0li ( half  life 53.3 days ) in the early phases of novae by the future mission integral would also confirm the thermonuclear runaway model for novae and the nucleosynthesis related to it .",
    "a one  dimensional , lagrangian , implicit hydrodynamic code has been developed following the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "the code has been built in such a way as to enable the study of both the hydrostatic accretion phase and the fully hydrodynamic explosion .",
    "detailed nucleosynthesis is obtained by means of an extended reaction network , including 100 nuclei , ranging from @xmath11h to @xmath12ca , linked through an up to date network including more than 370 nuclear reactions ( see @xcite and @xcite for the details ) . concerning the reactions involved in @xmath0be synthesis ,",
    "rates are taken from the @xcite compilation , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "dependent convection is included in the code , since the hypothesis that the convection time scale is always shorter than the nuclear time scale , inherent to time ",
    "independent convection , is not always fulfilled . with this method , partial mixing in the convective region",
    "is included .",
    "complete evolution of the accretion and explosion stages of white dwarfs with masses ranging from 1 to 1.25 m@xmath13 , accreting at a rate of 2m@xmath13.yr@xmath14 , with initial luminosity 10@xmath15l@xmath16 has been computed .",
    "we assume that the infalling material is of solar composition , but that some mixing process ( diffusion , shear mixing ) mixes it with the underlying co ( for m=1 and 1.15 m@xmath13 ) or onemg ( for m=1.15 and 1.25 m@xmath13 ) core .",
    "this assumption is based on the current prediction that enhanced cno ( or onemg ) abundances are required in order to produce a nova outburst and to explain some observed abundances ( see @xcite for a recent review , and @xcite and @xcite , for recent calculations of co and onemg novae , respectively ) .",
    "we want to stress that the problem of the initial composition of nova envelopes is rather complicated and that it is far from being understood in a self  consistent way .",
    "studies of diffusion during accretion onto co white dwarfs have been carried out ( @xcite and @xcite ) , but it is not clear if enough enhancements of heavy elements are obtained in the ejecta . for the onemg white dwarfs , these studies are still lacking .",
    "therefore , a compromise is to adopt some percentage of mixing with core abundances .",
    "we have adopted a 50% of mixing by mass with core abundances , as was done in the work by @xcite .",
    "the chain of reactions leading to the formation of @xmath0be has been extensively discussed in @xcite . during hydrogen burning",
    ", the formation of @xmath0be  proceeds through @xmath17he(@xmath18be from the initial @xmath7he as ( p,@xmath19 ) reactions can not bridge the a=5 gap .",
    "it is destroyed by @xmath20be(p,@xmath21b , followed by either @xmath22b(@xmath23he or @xmath22b(p,@xmath24c(@xmath25,p)2@xmath26he . however , at high temperature the photodisintegration of @xmath22b , @xmath22b(@xmath19,p)@xmath20be , becomes faster than proton capture on @xmath20be . in these conditions ,",
    "the effective lifetime of @xmath0be  can become larger than the time scale of the outburst ( @xcite ) . for typical densities at the base of the envelope at the onset of explosion",
    ", this would happen only above t@xmath27 .",
    "below this temperature destruction by @xmath20be(p,@xmath21b is efficient .",
    "other destruction mechanisms are @xmath20be(@xmath28c and beta decay to @xmath0li .",
    "radiative alpha capture on @xmath0be  is always slower than proton capture as long as photodisintegration of @xmath22b is not efficient .",
    "the half - life of @xmath0be  ( 53.3 days ) would allow the formation of @xmath0li  long after the outburst when the cooler envelope would prevent the rapid destruction of this fragile isotope .",
    "since @xmath0be  is more efficiently destroyed than produced below t@xmath291 and since it originates only from initial @xmath7he , it can only be formed during the outburst if enough @xmath7he  survives the initial phase when the hydrodynamic time scale is much longer than in the explosive phase .",
    "the @xmath7he  found in the envelope originates from the accreted material and from the reaction @xmath30h(p,@xmath31h followed immediately by @xmath32h(p,@xmath33he , which increases slightly the @xmath7he  abundance in the initial phase of accretion .",
    "the two major modes of @xmath7he  destruction are through @xmath17he(@xmath17he,2p)@xmath26he and @xmath17he(@xmath26he,@xmath34be .",
    "@xmath17he(@xmath26he,@xmath34be is always slower than @xmath17he(@xmath17he,2p)@xmath26he , except at lower @xmath7he  abundances .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the latter reaction is responsible for the logarithmic dependence of the @xmath0be yield with respect to the initial @xmath7he abundance above x(@xmath17he)@xmath13 .",
    "this means that hypothetical higher than solar initial @xmath7he abundances , related to enriched secondary star envelopes , do not alter dramatically the final @xmath0be yields .",
    "the results presented in this paper are little affected by nuclear uncertainties as the rates of the reactions of @xmath7he destruction are precisely known .",
    "for the onemg model with m=1.15 m@xmath13 , hereafter called one model since magnesium is almost absent ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , we show the profiles of @xmath7he and @xmath0be abundances along the envelope for different times starting at the beginning of the accretion phase in figure [ f : hydro2 ] .",
    "the corresponding temperatures at the base of the envelope are 10@xmath20k , 2k , 3k , 5k , 10@xmath22k , and the maximum temperature ( 2k ) .",
    "an additional model , for which a considerable expansion has already occurred ( r@xmath35 cm ) , is also shown .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath7he is destroyed down to abundances between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , by mass , at the end of the accretion phase .",
    "more specifically , these abundances correspond to the phase during which temperatures are around @xmath38 k , allowing the photodisintegration of @xmath22b to prevent @xmath0be destruction ( see discussion above ) .",
    "therefore , the final @xmath0be abundances are similar to the @xmath7he ones at this critical phase .",
    "it is important to notice that these values are much higher than those at the burning shell ( @xmath39 by mass , see figure [ f : hydro2 ] ) , indicating that one  zone models are unable to provide correct yields .",
    "the average mass fraction of @xmath0be in the shells that will be ejected and , thus , will contribute to interstellar medium enrichment , is around @xmath36 .",
    "since all the @xmath0li finally produced comes from the decay of @xmath0be and as temperatures of our last model are low enough to prevent @xmath0li destruction , the final @xmath0li yield corresponds to the addition of @xmath0be and @xmath0li mass fractions in the ejected shells .",
    "the final ejected mass is 1.9m@xmath16 , with a mean abundance of @xmath0li by mass of 6.0 .",
    "thus , 1.1 m@xmath16 of @xmath0li would be ejected ( see table1 ) .",
    "concerning the co cases , @xmath7he destruction is less pronounced , at the same critical phase , and this allows the synthesis of a larger amount of @xmath0be .",
    "the corresponding profiles of @xmath7he and @xmath0be are shown in figure [ f : hydro3 ] , for the m=1.15 m@xmath13 case .",
    "the mean mass fraction of @xmath0li is 8.2 ( the ejected mass of @xmath0li is 1.1m@xmath16 and the total ejected mass is 1.3m@xmath16 ) .",
    "the main reason for the different nucleosynthesis in both cases is that for co novae the presence of @xmath40c implies that the fast reaction @xmath40c(p,@xmath41n(@xmath42c is dominant during the late accretion phase ( whereas the energy production through this reaction is lower in one novae , as they almost lack from @xmath40c ) .",
    "consequently , the duration of the phase prior to maximum temperature is shorter in co novae , preventing an efficient @xmath7he destruction and thus leading to a larger final amount of @xmath0be synthesized .    as a summary of our results",
    "( see table 1 , where additional cases are shown ) , overproductions of @xmath0li with respect to the solar abundances between 100 and 2000 are obtained , depending mainly on the chemical composition of the envelope , which is related to that of the underlying core .",
    "it is hard to estimate its real contribution to the @xmath0li enrichment in the galaxy , since theoretical models systematically produce ejected masses smaller than the observed ones .",
    "for instance , our models typically eject @xmath43 m@xmath13 while the estimated mass of qu vul 1984 ( which has been invoked as a true  neon nova  ) is around 10@xmath44 m@xmath13 ( @xcite ) . for an overproduction factor",
    "as large as 2000 and a total ejected masses of @xmath43 m@xmath13 ( two orders of magnitude lower than observed for qu vul 1984 ) , a nova event would produce @xmath45 m@xmath13 of @xmath0li .",
    "if we adopt the galactic nova rate of @xcite ( 20 yr@xmath14 ) and an age of the galaxy of @xmath46 years , novae should produce at least 20 m@xmath13 of @xmath0li .",
    "this quantity is clearly smaller than the estimated present content of @xmath0li in the galaxy , @xmath47 150 m@xmath13 , but , given the uncertainties in the ejected mass per event the contribution of novae to the galactic content of @xmath0li can not be ruled out yet .",
    "a complete analysis of @xmath0li yields by novae and their inclusion in a model of galactic evolution is out of the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our results confirm that nova explosions can produce significant amounts of @xmath0li .",
    "overproduction factors as large as 2000 are obtained .",
    "our results are quite different from those obtained from one  zone models ( @xcite ) , as the most important contribution to @xmath0li enrichment comes from the external shells , where this element has been transported by convection from the burning shell .",
    "comparison with the results of @xcite and @xcite shows that the behavior of @xmath0be abundances can only be correctly predicted if the evolution of @xmath7he during the accretion phase is accurately followed .",
    "it is also necessary to stress that the final results strongly depend on the chemical composition at the onset of the explosion . if the underlying white dwarf is a co one , the @xmath0li abundances are about one order of magnitude larger than if the white dwarf is an one one .",
    "since the decay of @xmath0be to @xmath0li emits a photon with energy 478 kev , during a phase in which the envelope is very transparent , this transition could be detected by the future integral mission ( with a sensitivity around 6 at this energy ) .",
    "the flux of the @xmath0be decay line is :      for an ejected mass of 10@xmath49 m@xmath13 , with an abundance by mass of x(@xmath0be)=8 , the @xmath0be decay line would be detectable just after the outburst only for a nova closer than 0.5 kpc .",
    "but for an ejected mass of 10@xmath50 or 10@xmath44 m@xmath13 , more in accordance with observations , the lower limit for the distance would be 1.7 or 5.4 kpc , respectively . this detection would provide a confirmation of the theoretical models of novae and also ensure that @xmath0li is produced in these scenarios , encouraging a deep search of this element in novae .",
