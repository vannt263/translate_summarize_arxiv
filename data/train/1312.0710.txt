    "thin film solar cells have become a potential alternative to traditional crystalline silicon solar cells due to lower manufacturing costs , better flexibility , durability and shorter energy payback period . a better understanding of the underlying physics and the availability of mature fabrication technology makes amorphous silicon the preferred choice for thin film photovoltaic cells .",
    "but the widespread adoption of thin film solar cells is limited by its relatively poor absorption efficiency owing to the indirect band gap of silicon  @xcite .",
    "in general , the efficiency of solar cells can be improved either by increasing the light absorption efficiency or by increasing the minority carrier life time . in order to increase the light absorption ,",
    "it becomes necessary to incorporate light trapping mechanisms in solar cells .",
    "recent advancements in the field of plasmonics have opened up the possibility of using metallic nanoparticles to increase the absorption of thin film solar cells  @xcite .",
    "nanoparticles exhibit the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance when illuminated with light of suitable frequency  @xcite . near the plasmon resonance frequency , metallic nanoparticles",
    "strongly scatter light incident on it .",
    "this scattering effect is the result of the collective oscillations of electrons to re - radiate electromagnetic radiation  @xcite .",
    "when placed on the surface of silicon substrate , metallic nanoparticles scatter light preferentially into it due to the high refractive index of silicon  @xcite .",
    "the particles also scatter the incident light at an angle , thereby increasing the path length of photons within the silicon substrate . as a result , the optical thickness of the active region increases , thereby allowing the semiconductor substrate to absorb higher levels of electromagnetic radiation  @xcite .",
    "researchers have explored the possibility of placing nanoparticles on the surface  @xcite , rear  @xcite and within the active region  @xcite of thin film solar cells .",
    "multiple arrays of nano - structures placed either on the front , rear or both are used to further enhance the absorption efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of energy transfer between discrete nano - structures located at the surface and active region of a solar cell is used to control the flow of energy and improve absorption efficiency  @xcite . in these cases , enhancing the quantum efficiency has been considered over limited bands of wavelengths .",
    "also , a loss in performance is possible if the metallic nanoparticles are introduced in the bulk due to increased recombination  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to prevent the metallic nanoparticles from acting as recombination centers either by using room temperature processes such as microcontact printing  @xcite or by passivating it with a dielectric coating  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these facts , in this paper , we enhance the light absorption efficiency of a thin film a - si solar cell by placing periodic arrays of silver nanoparticles at the surface and within the active region of the cell .",
    "the surface and bulk layer of nanoparticles enhances the absorption of lower and higher wavelengths respectively .",
    "in addition the absorption of light within the substrate is further enhanced by the simultaneous resonance from the surface and bulk layers at intermediate wavelengths . due to the multiple and high - angle scattering from both the layers of nanoparticles , the effective optical path length of light increases inside the cell .",
    "this results in several fold increase in the optical thickness of the active region without increasing the physical thickness  @xcite .",
    "understanding the basic mechanism of localized surface plasmon resonance and various parameters affecting it is necessary to engineer the nanoparticles for light trapping applications in solar cells .",
    "the resonant behavior of localized surface plasmons are restricted to a limited range of frequencies determined by the size and shape of the particles , dielectric functions of the involved media , and the electromagnetic interaction between them  @xcite . when the frequency of light incident on the nanoparticles match the natural frequency of the oscillating surface electrons , the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance",
    "is established  @xcite .",
    "the collective response of the electrons in spherical metallic nanoparticles with dimension much lesser than the wavelength of light is described by the dipolar polarizability @xmath2 ;  @xcite    @xmath3    where v is the particle volume , @xmath4 is the dielectric function of the embedding medium and @xmath5 is the dielectric function of the metallic nanoparticle . the size dependent dielectric function the particle @xmath6 is given by ,  @xcite    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the diameter of the particle and @xmath9 .",
    "the size independent first term @xmath10 is due to interband transitions .",
    "the second term is the drude - sommerfeld free electron term which contains the bulk plasmon frequency @xmath11 , given by @xmath12 where n is the density of free electrons , e is the electronic charge , m is the effective mass of an electron and @xmath13 is the free - space dielectric constant , and the size - dependent damping constant @xmath14;@xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the bulk damping rate and @xmath17 is the fermi velocity of the electrons .",
    "a is a dimensionless size parameter which accounts for the additional surface damping terms , such as the inelastic collisions between electrons and chemical interface damping .",
    "inelastic collisions shorten the mean free path of the electrons when nanoparticle size decreases .",
    "chemical interface damping occurs in embedded nanoparticles , where the fast energy transfer between the particle and its surroundings results in the loss of phase coherence of the collective electron oscillation .",
    "the particle polarizability becomes large when @xmath18 , and this effect is called surface plasmon resonance . at resonance the particle scattering cross - section area , @xmath19 , a parameter that determines the extent to which scattering of light occurs , is several times the geometric cross section of the particle  @xcite .",
    "@xmath20    where @xmath21 is the wavelength of the incident light .",
    "for particles with diameter in the range of a few nanometers , scattering is also accompanied by absorption . as particle diameter increases to around 100 nanometers , the scattering effect strongly outweighs the absorption by the particle  @xcite .",
    "also , the resonance is accompanied by another process , namely dynamic depolarization  @xcite . as size increases",
    ", the oscillation of the conduction electrons at resonance goes out of phase , resulting in a red shift of the particle resonance .",
    "the increase in size also results in higher radiation damping , which results in the broadening of the range of frequencies at which resonance occurs  @xcite .",
    "the surface plasmon resonance can be tuned to a large extent either by coating or sandwiching the nanostructure with a dielectric medium .",
    "the medium can markedly enhance the red shift of the central wavelength and consequently obtain a wide tunable range at higher wavelengths  @xcite . both red shifting and broadening of resonance frequencies",
    "are advantageous for the solar cell  @xcite .",
    "in our thin film solar cell design , the active region is made of amorphous silicon having a thickness of @xmath22 .",
    "spherically shaped silver nanoparticles are placed periodically in rectangular arrays on the surface as well as inside the active region of the substrate .",

    "the magnitude of the absorption peak increases when the @xmath23 increases from @xmath47 to @xmath50 .",

    "it is also observed that the @xmath51 curve broadens as @xmath23 increases .",
    "the red - shift and broadening of @xmath51 with increase in @xmath23 is because of dynamic depolarization and radiation damping  @xcite .",
    "the field experienced by the nanoparticles can be considered as spatially constant but with time varying phase when the size of the homogeneous particle is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light .",
    "this is known as the quasistatic limit@xcite . for smaller values of @xmath23",
    "the displacement of charges is homogeneous which result in a dipolar charge distribution on the surface .",

    "as @xmath23 increases , the displacement of electronic cloud loses its homogeneity . as a result of this multipolar charge distributions",

    "in addition to this , an additional polarization field is produced by the accelerated electrons  @xcite .",
    "this field reacts against the quasistatic polarization field and shifts the position of the resonant modes to larger wavelengths .",
    "also the electrons lose energy due to this secondary radiation and experience a damping effect which results in the widening of the range of frequencies over which surface plasmon resonance occurs  @xcite .",
    "thus the increase in particle size makes broader and asymmetric surface plasmon resonance peaks which are red - shifted and reduced in intensity .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows that the particles in the bulk layer do not significantly affect the absorption at lower wavelengths but have a notable effect at higher wavelengths . the frequencies and intensities of localized surface plasmon resonances are known to be sensitive to the dielectric properties of the medium@xcite and in particular , to the refractive index of matter close to the particle surface@xcite .",

    "it is evident from the graph that the surface layer radius variation affects the absorption to a higher extend .",
    "an initial increase in the radius of the surface layer nanoparticles causes an increment in @xmath34 but decreases when the particle radii exceeds @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , @xmath34 increases with increase in @xmath24 upto @xmath54 and then decreases with further increment in @xmath24 .",
    "the proposed design contains vertically aligned nanoparticle arrays in the surface as well as in the bulk of the a - si substrate .",
    "but perfect vertical alignment is difficult to attain practically . in order to understand the extend to which the alignment of two nanoparticle layers affect the light absorption in the proposed design",
    ", the bulk array is moved in the horizontal direction while keeping the position of the surface array unaltered as shown in fig .",
    "the horizontal distance @xmath55 between the centers of nanoparticles in both the layers is a measure of misalignment between the particle layers .",
    "the variation in absorption when the bulk array is moved away from the normal is shown in fig . 8 .",

    "a slight mismatch in vertical alignment of nanoparticle arrays does not affect the overall absorption .",
    "therefore the constraint of perfect vertical alignment can be relaxed while placing nanoparticle arrays in the solar cell .",
    "the performance of the solar cell can be improved by tuning the parameters of the cell , namely the radii of the nanoparticles in both arrays(@xmath56 ) , the period of the rectangular array of particles ( @xmath25 ) and the vertical distance between the two particle layers ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "the quantum efficiency of the optimized design is compared with plain a - si substrate in fig .",
    "the absorption efficiency of the substrate is improved for all wavelengths ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath66 in the proposed design .",

    "we studied the effect of dielectric coating thickness on @xmath34 and found that the variation is minimal if the thickness is below @xmath67 .",
    "if the a - si film thickness is thin , the recombination in the bulk of a - si can be neglected  @xcite .",

    ", the theoretical study shows that the thin film amorphous silicon solar cell with nanoparticle arrays placed on the surface and in the semiconductor layer showed significant improvement in absorption efficiency .",
    "the metallic nanoparticles at the surface contributes to the enhancement at lower wavelengths and those embedded within the absorber layer contributes to the enhancement at higher wavelengths .",
