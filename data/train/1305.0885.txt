    "quantum entanglement apart from being central to the investigations of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics , has also been used as a resource enabling efficient quantum information processing protocols like quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , cryptography @xcite , quantum cloning @xcite etc .",
    "the question of usefulness of states for quantum teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite have also been studied in detail .",
    "although most of the information processing protocols put emphasis on the use of two level systems as the fundamental units of quantum information transfer , there is a growing interest among the quantum information community to study multi - level or higher dimensional systems for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "this attributes to the fact that in the higher dimensions quantum information processes are supposed to be more efficient in certain situations .",
    "for example , a quantum state in a large dimensional space contains more information than one in small dimensional space @xcite .",
    "moreover , the present experimental context also makes it reasonable to consider the manipulation of more - than - two - level quantum information carriers .    in this article",
    ", we address the problem of using higher dimensional systems for quantum information processing .",
    "central to our investigation is the usefulness of mixed states of two qutrits , obtained as an output from buzek - hillery universal quantum cloning machine @xcite , as resources for quantum teleportation and dense coding protocols .",
    "our analysis of teleportation and dense coding using higher dimensional systems provides some interesting aspects about the outputs obtained from the cloning machine when used as resources in quantum information processing .",
    "we show that the non - optimal output state obtained from the buzek - hillery cloning machine can be used more efficiently as a resource for quantum information processing in comparison to the optimal output state obtained from the buzek - hillery cloning machine .",
    "surprisingly , our results show that the optimal teleportation fidelity for a distilled non - optimal output state as a resource is more than the optimal teleportation fidelity for a distilled optimal output state as a resource for a certain range of machine parameters .",
    "for dense coding one can successfully use only a distilled non - optimal output state as a resource and not the distilled optimal output state .",
    "we believe that the results obtained in this article would add another important dimension to the applicability of quantum cloning machines to quantum information processing @xcite .    in section @xmath1 , we give a brief review of buzek hillery universal quantum cloning machine and discuss the entanglement properties of the output states obtained from the cloning machine .",
    "section @xmath2 and section @xmath3 , deal with the analysis of the optimal and non - optimal output state , respectively for quantum information processing .",
    "we conclude the article with results and discussions in section @xmath4 .",
    "in order to facilitate the discussion of our analysis and results , we briefly describe v. buzek and m. hillery s universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) for arbitrary higher dimensional hilbert space@xcite .",
    "if we consider the initial state of the cloning machine as @xmath5 , then the cloning transformation is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the initial state to be cloned and @xmath8 is the blank copy on which the input state has to be cloned with real parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the unitarity of the transformation ensures the following relation between the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; @xmath11 the values of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 which guarantee the universality and optimality of the transformation is given by @xmath12 and @xmath13@xcite .",

    "therefore , the state ( [ rhoout ] ) is a npt state for @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the fact that the cloned two - qutrit system generated from the uqcm is a npt state motivates us to analyse its utility for quantum information processing tasks such as teleportation and dense coding .",
    "the output two - qutrit state obtained from the cloning machine will be an optimal state @xmath26 for @xmath27 . from ( [ rhoout ] ) , it is easy to show that such an output state would be an npt state according to @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fully entangled fraction for any arbitrary state @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 where maximum is taken over all the maximally entangled basis states @xmath30 .",
    "further , we know that a qutrit system can be used as a teleportation channel , if its fully entangled fraction i.e. @xmath31 is greater than @xmath32 @xcite . in order to confirm the utility of the two qutrit optimal output state @xmath33 in teleportation , we now proceed to calculate its fully entangled fraction .",
    "+ the maximally entangled orthonormal basis for two - qutrit system can be represented as @xcite @xmath34 where , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is an orthonormal basis for the space of one qutrit .",
    "therefore , considering the optimal output state @xmath26 and using ( [ fef ] ) , ( [ qutbas ] ) and @xmath37 we find that , @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the state @xmath26 can not be used as a resource for quantum teleportation .",
    "quantum dense coding is the simplest example where one can utilize a shared entangled system to efficiently transfer the information between the users . for any @xmath0 dimensional system",
    ", the capacity of dense coding for any given shared state @xmath39 can be defined as , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the von - neumann entropy of the reduced system @xmath42 and @xmath43 is von - neumann entropy for the joint state @xmath39 .",
    "a shared quantum state is thus said to be useful for dense coding , if the corresponding capacity @xmath44 is more than @xmath45 . from ( [ densecodeability ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that such states are precisely those for which @xmath46 .",
    "+ for the state @xmath26 , we find that @xmath47 and hence the state @xmath48 is not useful for the dense coding protocol .",
    "+      in section 3 , we have seen that the optimal output state @xmath26 is not useful for teleportation and dense coding protocols . for @xmath49 dimensional systems ,",
    "any state can be made useful for teleportation @xcite .",
    "however , for qutrit systems and other higher dimensional systems such possibilities have not been explored .    in this section ,",
    "we try to distill the optimal output state using an appropriate filter to check the suitability of the filtered state for the teleportation and dense coding protocols .",
    "_ showed that any state violating the reduction criteria is distillable @xcite . using the above criteria , it is easy to find that the state @xmath26 violates the reduction criteria and hence is also distillable . + the distilled @xmath26 can be obtained by calculating the eigenvector corresponding to the suitable negative eigenvalue of the state @xmath50 and subjecting the state to the appropriate filter .",
    "further , we know that if @xmath28 is any state and @xmath51 is a filter then a new state @xmath52 can be found as @xmath53 where @xmath51 is the filter @xcite . following the procedures described in @xcite , we construct the filter for the optimal state @xmath26 .",
    "the filter is denoted by @xmath54 and is given by @xmath55 using ( [ filteredform ] ) , we find the filtered form of @xmath26 denoted by @xmath56 such that @xmath57 interestingly , the filtered optimal state ( [ filteredoptrhoout ] ) is found to be suitable for teleportation since the fully entangled fraction of @xmath56 = @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , the optimal teleportation fidelity for any arbitrary state @xmath28 in @xmath2 dimensional system is defined as @xmath59therefore , in our case the optimal teleportation fidelity of the state @xmath56 is given by @xmath60similarly for the dense coding protocol using ( [ densecodeability ] ) and ( [ filteredoptrhoout ] ) , we see that @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the filtered optimal state is still not useful for dense coding .",
    "the output state generated from the cloning machine depends on the machine parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for all the values of the parameter @xmath10 ( except for @xmath62 ) in the range @xmath19 $ ] , the output state @xmath63 is a non - optimal state .",
    "although we have shown that the state @xmath63 is always a npt state in this range , i.e. when @xmath19 $ ] , the fully entangled fraction ( [ fef ] ) of the state @xmath63 is @xmath64 which never exceeds @xmath32 . hence",
    ", the non - optimal state @xmath63 is also not useful to be used as a resource for teleportation process .    in order to see whether the state @xmath63 is useful in dense coding or not",
    ", we plot a graph between @xmath65 and the machine parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath66 is the reduced density operator of the two qutrit output state @xmath67 and is given by @xmath68 it is clear from the fig .",
    "( 1 ) that the two qutrit non optimal state @xmath63 is not useful for dense coding when @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "as the non optimal output state also can not be used for information transfer , we try to find out whether it is possible to distill the non optimal output state using an appropriate filter so that the distilled system can be used for quantum information protocols .",
    "similar to the optimal state output , the non optimal state ( [ rhoout ] ) also violates the reduction criteria @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to distill the non optimal output state @xmath33 of two qutrits . for this , we calculate the eigenvector corresponding to the suitable negative eigenvalue of the state @xmath69 and by subjecting the state to an appropriate filter . in this case , the obtained eigenvalue is expressed as @xmath70 which is always negative for @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "hence , following @xcite , we construct the filter @xmath72 to distill the state @xmath63 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "this filter thus transforms @xmath63 to its filtered form @xmath75 given by @xmath76 therefore , fully entangled fraction of the distilled state @xmath75 is @xmath77}{3[(1-k)+ t_{2}(6 - 68\\mu^{2}+94\\mu^{4}-4t_{1}+12t_{1}\\mu^{2})+\\mu^{2}(6t_{1}-9 - 5\\mu^{2}+23t_{1}\\mu^{2 } ) ] } \\label{feffilnonopt1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "evidently , for @xmath80 $ ] , the states @xmath81 are always suitable for teleportation since @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , the optimal teleportation fidelity of @xmath81 is given by @xmath83 the plot between the optimal teleportation fidelity and @xmath10 in fig .",
    "( 2 ) also confirms the utility of @xmath75 as an entangled resource for teleportation protocol .    in order to check the usefulness of the state @xmath84 for dense coding",
    ", we show that @xmath85 , for @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "hence , the state @xmath75 can also be used as a resource in dense coding protocol asalso evident from the fig .",
    "interestingly , the optimal fidelity obtained in case of teleportation using the distilled non - optimal output state as an entangled resource is greater than the optimal fidelity obtained in case of teleportation using the distilled optimal output state .",
    "moreover , the distilled optimal output state can not be used for dense coding but the distilled non - optimal output state can be successfully used as a resourse for dense coding .",
    "we have studied the entanglement properties and the usefulness of a two qutrit output state generated through buzek - hillery quantum cloning machine for quantum information processing .",
    "although we found that the optimal as well as non - optimal output states are not useful for information processing protocols such as teleportation and dense coding , the distilled output states using appropriate filters can be used as a entangled resource for information processing for certain range of machine parameters .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the distilled optimal output state can only be used for teleportation , the distilled non - optimal output state can be used for teleportation as well as dense coding .",
    "surprisingly , the optimal teleportation fidelity obtained using the distilled non - optimal output state exceeds the optimal teleportation fidelity obtained using the distilled optimal output state for certain values of machine parameter @xmath10 .",
