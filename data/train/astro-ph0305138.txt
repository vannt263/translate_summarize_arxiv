    "note that the mean free path actually increases with density between @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xmath106 because of the rapid decrease of @xmath114 with density .",

    "unfortunately , the parameter @xmath73 which was used in @xcite to include short range correlations may have some density dependence .",
    "this should be investigated in future work .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the significant differences between neutrino and antineutrino mean free paths to persist in calculations using more sophisticated interactions . at lower densities ,",
    "the rpa mean free path becomes shorter than that in a hartree approximation because of coupling to density fluctuations related to the transition to a nonuniform phase .",
    "this was previously discussed .",
    "increasing the temperature to 10 mev , as shown in figure ( [ fig6 ] ) , increases the average neutrino energy .",
    "weak magnetism effects grow with energy so the difference between neutrino and antineutrino mean free paths is now larger than at t=5 mev .",
    "this difference continues to grow as the temperature is increased further to 25 mev in figure ( [ fig7 ] ) and 50 mev in figure ( [ fig8 ] ) . at these higher temperatures",
    "there is no longer a significant reduction in the rpa relative to hartree mean free paths at low densities .",
    "this is because the system is now far from any phase transition .",

    "this is important because of the very large energy radiated in neutrinos .",

    "this is especially true at high temperatures where neutrino energies are large .",
    "this difference , between @xmath18 and @xmath117 mean free paths , depends only weakly on density and could produce @xmath1 and @xmath4 spectra that are somewhat colder than those of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",

    "however , we do not include any residual interaction from pion exchange or short range correlations .",
    "these could increase the mean free path further .",
    "therefore our results represent a minimum calculation that is consistent with the equation of state .",
    "future work studying the role of short range correlations and the density dependence of the effective interaction would be very useful .    at low density ,",
    "correlations reduce the mean free path because of excitation of low energy collective density oscillations . these are related to the eventual transition of neutron rich matter to a nonuniform phase .",
    "our rpa calculations can only describe very small amplitude density fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless we expect neutrinos will couple very effectively to the large amplitude density fluctuations present in the nonuniform phase .",
