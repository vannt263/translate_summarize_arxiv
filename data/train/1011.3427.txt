    "a study of the characteristic changes in spectral and variability properties of x - ray binaries has proven to be a valuable source of information on the physics governing the accretion processes and on the fundamental parameters of black hole ( bh ) sources .",
    "bh observational appearance is conventionally described in terms of bh state classification ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for different definitions of bh states ) .",
    "we adopt the following bh state classification for five major bh states : the _ quiescent _ , _ low - hard _ ( lhs ) , _ intermediate _ ( is ) , _ high - soft _ ( hss ) and _ very soft _ states ( vss ) .",
    "when a bh transient goes into outburst , it leaves the quiescent state and enters the lhs , a low luminosity state with the energy spectrum dominated by a comptonization component combined ( convolved ) with a weak thermal component .",
    "the photon spectrum in the lhs is presumably a result of comptonization ( upscattering ) of soft photons , originating from a relatively weak accretion disk , off electrons of the hot ambient plasma [ see e.g. @xcite , hereafter st80 ] .",
    "the hss photon spectrum is characterized by a prominent thermal component which is probably a signature of a strong emission coming from a geometrically thin accretion disk .",
    "a weak power - law component is also present at the level of not more than 20% of the total source flux .",
    "timing and spectral properties of an accreting bh are tightly correlated for a number of bh sources [ see @xcite and a comprehensive study of these correlations was done by @xcite , @xcite , hereafter st09 and ts09 , respectively ] .",
    "correlations between the spectral hardness ( photon index ) and the characteristic frequencies of the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in the lightcurves of bh sources has been proposed to use as a tool to determine a bh mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tf04 ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated and then st09 confirmed that there is a correlation between values qpo frequencies and the disk flux , namely mass accretion rate @xmath4 in the disk , for a number of bh candidates ( bhcs ) .",
    "moreover , st09 , ts09 and @xcite , hereafter st10 , also found strong correlations between spectral index and @xmath0 , where @xmath5 is dimensionless mass accretion rate in units of critical mass accretion rate @xmath6 , in 19 spectral transition episodes from 10 bh sources observed with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_. st09 combine these index - qpo and index-@xmath0 correlations to measure bh masses in 7 bh sources .",
    "for some of these sources , ( i.e. h 1743 - 322 , cyg x-1 , xte 1650 - 500 , gx 339 - 4 and xte j1859 - 226 ) this new st09 method provides a much better precision than conventional dynamical methods ( see st09 ) .",
    "in addition ts09 and st10 using index-@xmath0 correlations evaluate bh masses in grs 1915 + 105 and ss 433 respectively .",
    "the index - qpo and index-@xmath0 correlation has a specific shape characterized by a rise part followed by the saturation plateau .",
    "the st09 method is based on scaling ( sliding ) the correlation pattern related to a reference source vs that of a given source for which a bh mass is determined .",
    "this determination can be only done for this pair of the sources if the saturation values of index and inclination of the rising part are the same for both .",
    "thus , the correlation patterns need to be self - similar to implement this scaling and , finally , to obtain a bh mass for a given source . using results from @xcite , hereafter lt99",
    ", tf04 who were the first to suggest a model for the index-@xmath0 correlation observed in bhcs , we further explore the model of index-@xmath0 correlation and present a thorough modeling of this correlation using monte carlo simulations for a wide range of basic model parameters .",
    "we also investigate the possibility that the shape of the correlation pattern provides a direct signature of the bulk motion ( converging ) flow onto a black hole , which _ would _ be the signature of the black hole [ see @xcite , @xcite and lt99 for more details on this subject ] .",
    "we present theoretical arguments based on the monte - carlo simulation and analytic consideration that the index - mass accretion rate saturation effect observed in a number of bhcs is a signature of a bh converging flow .",
    "this saturation effect should occur when the mass accretion rate @xmath4 exceeds the eddington limit @xmath7 , which can only exist in bh sources , see @xcite .",
    "the origin of the spectral state transition and its final end as a steep power - law in the high soft states is still debated in the literature [ see e.g. @xcite , hereafter ct95 , lt99 , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , hereafter rm06 ]",
    ". however , there is agreement within the community that the spectral transition is driven by mass accretion in the system ( see e.g. ct95 , rm06 ) such that , when @xmath0 increases a bh source goes from the lhs to soft states ( hss or vss ) through the intermediate state ( is ) , but a detailed scenario for this transition is still missing .",
    "a natural question to ask is : why does the source go to either the hss or the vss and what physical processes are behind of each of these transitions ?",
    "the soft component of the observed x - ray spectra is usually fitted by a blackbody ( bb ) shape modified by comptonization for which the comptonization parameter @xmath8 decreases , or the energy index of the comptonization green s function @xmath9 increases towards a softer state [ see details in ts09 ] .",
    "furthermore , when the mass accretion rate increases up to some critical value photon index @xmath10 starts to saturate to a value of about 4.2 .",
    "what mechanism is responsible for the behavior of @xmath11 vs @xmath0 and for the saturation level of the index ?",
    "in contrast , st09 and ts09 show that the index of the hard component of the x - ray spectrum @xmath12 saturates to different levels that varies between 2 to 3 for different sources and for different outbursts in a given source .",
    "for example , @xmath12 saturates to 3 in grs 1915 + 105 ( ts09 ) and to 2.3 in ss 433 ( st10 ) and it varies from 2 to 2.6 for different outbursts in gx 339 - 4 ( see st09 ) .    another phenomenon revealed in x - ray observations of compact objects [ neutron stars ( nss ) and bhs ] is related to the evolution of a high energy efold ( cutoff ) energy @xmath1 of the spectra during the spectral evolution . for nss",
    ", @xmath2 steadily decreases from the hard state to the soft state [ @xcite , @xcite ] but , in bhs , the observational pattern of @xmath1 vs @xmath0 is such that @xmath2 begins to decrease with @xmath0 , which is then followed by a shift of @xmath1 to higher values when @xmath0 increases @xcite .",
    "we present our picture of accretion in the innermost part of source , the comptonization region [ compton cloud ( cc ) ] and a model to calculate the cc plasma temperature in  [ model ] .",
    "we provide the details of the monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations in  [ mc ] .",
    "we present a combined effect of thermal and bulk motion comptonization and bh spectral evolution in  [ thermal+bulk ] .",
    "we show and discuss our mc simulation results and their theoretical explanation related to the index - mass accretion rate correlation in ",
    "[ mc_index - mdot ] .",
    "specifically , we discuss the signature of bulk motion comptonization ( bmc ) and its relation to the index evolution during state transition .",
    "also , we show that the index saturation effect is a direct consequence of the existence of the innermost bulk motion region and , therefore , can be considered to be an observational signature of a bh .",
    "@xmath1-@xmath0 correlations results and their interpretation are shown in  [ e_cf - mdot ] .",
    "conclusions follow in  [ summary ] .",
    "we illustrate our accretion scenario in figure [ geometry ] , which we suggest taking place in the innermost part of a black hole source .",
    "we assume that an accretion flow onto a black hole ( bh ) consists of three parts : a geometrically thin accretion disk [ standard shakura - sunyaev disk , see @xcite ] , a transition layer ( tl ) , which is an intermediate link between the accretion disk , and a converging ( bulk ) flow region ( see tf04 ) , that is assumed to exist , at least , below 3 schwarzschild radii , @xmath13 .",
    "there is substantial observational evidence for this three component model for accretion flows onto black holes [ see @xcite , hereafter tsa07 , st09 , ts09 and st10 ] .",
    "in addition , power density spectra ( pdss ) during the transition from the low - hard to high - soft states indicate low and high frequency white - red noise ( wrn ) components , with discrete lorentzian qpo features superposed .",
    "the low frequency wrn component dominates in the high - soft state pdss while the high frequency pds component dominates in the low - hard state , with the interpretation that these two components represent the diffusion of perturbations in an outer accretion disk and an inner compton corona ( transition layer ) , respectively .",
    "these two regions are probably separated by an accretion shock , which moves to smaller radii in the high - soft state and to larger radii in the low - hard state ( tsa07 ) .",
    "this accretion shock represents a location in the disk where the outer keplerian flow begins to transition to the inner sub - keplerian motion of the compact object and its inner corona .",
    "we assume that the plasma temperature of the converging flow is near that of the tl ( or corona ) .",
    "the tl temperature can be presented in the analytical form using eq .",
    "( 12 ) in tf04 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is tl optical depth and @xmath16 is a ratio of the energy releases in the disk and transition layer , respectively .",
    "we relate @xmath15 to optical depth of the converging flow @xmath17 region by using the flow continuity equation @xmath18 where the free - fall velocity @xmath19 @xmath20 is the speed of light , @xmath21 is an outer radius of the converging flow and @xmath22 is a tl magneto - acoustic velocity averaged over the layer @xmath22 and approximately equals to radial velocity of the tl flow .    the optical depth of the converging flow , as evaluated by an observer at rest ,",
    "is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a dimensionless mass accretion rate in units of the critical mass accretion rate @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the dimensionless outer radius of the converging flow in units of schwarzschild radius @xmath27 .",
    "note , if the dimensionless bh spin @xmath28 is less than 0.8 then @xmath29 [ see @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite , hereafter tbw01 , estimated the _",
    "b_-field around neutron stars ( ns ) based on observed kilohertz and viscous quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequencies .",
    "they found that the best - fit values of @xmath30 in the transition layer related to the _ b_-field of ns and plasma density is in the range of @xmath31 cm s@xmath32 , where + @xmath33 cm s@xmath32 and @xmath34 is tl plasma density which is of order of @xmath35 g @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no estimate of @xmath30 for the innermost part of a bh that is based on observations .",
    "@xcite introduced the reynolds number @xmath37 ( @xmath38 in their notation ) where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are an average radial velocity , an average viscosity over a given configuration , respectively and @xmath41 is a configuration scale .",
    "they demonstrated that the size of the transition layer ( cc ) between the fast rotating accretion disk and the relatively slow rotating central object ( either bh or ns ) strongly depends on the reynolds number @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , @xcite infer , by analyzing x - ray data for cyg x-1 , that the reynolds number @xmath42 of accretion flow in the transition layer increases from 10 to 100 when the source evolves from the low / hard state to the high / soft state .",
    "this is possible when an increase of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) leads to the @xmath42 rise .    because @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath43 ( and @xmath44 )",

    "it is also worthwhile to emphasize that the index saturation of the soft component of x - ray spectra is detected in _ rxte",

    "this idea of advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , first introduced by @xcite , is very popular in the astrophysical community .",
    "to illustrate this , we use cyg x-1 , where it has been shown [ see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ] that the x - ray source is powered mainly by accretion from the strong stellar wind of the supergiant star .",
    "there is a strong observational indication of the presence of sub - keplerian flow in this source .",
    "the temperature of this flow @xmath142 can be dictated by the photons comptonized in the transition layer .",

    "dynamical ( bulk ) comptonization spectra can be distinguished from thermal comptonization spectra when there is information about the evolution of @xmath1 with @xmath0 .",
    "this information is inferred from x - ray observations of spectral transitions in bhcs , where the evolution patterns are drastically different between the two comptonizations . in figure",
    "[ fig11 ] , we plot how the high energy efold @xmath1 energy varies with the mass accretion rate @xmath0 . in the _ bulk motion comptonization _",
    "case the efold energy @xmath1 decreases and then increases when mass accretion rate @xmath150 ( see figure [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "note that in the thermal comptonization spectra @xmath1 is proportional to the plasma temperature @xmath52 ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "given that @xmath152 saturates to constant value of 2 kev for @xmath150 ( see fig .",

    "we have studied , using monte carlo simulations , the evolution of x - ray energy spectra from the low - hard state to the high - soft state , and found that a hard spectrum should be observed at relatively low values of mass accretion rate independently of the velocity profile ( see fig .",

    "further , for low velocities of the accretion flow in the transition layer ( tl ) @xmath154 , there is plasma accumulation at high mass accretion rates that produces high optical depth and thus one can barely see the high energy tail .",
    "an emergent spectrum is characterized by a blackbody like shape of temperature on order of 1 kev and the relatively weak hard tail ( see the green spectral histogram in the upper panel in fig .",

    "our results predict index saturation vs mass accretion rate ( see figs . [ fig7]-[fig8 ] ) .",
    "finally , we showed that the efold energy @xmath1 of the emergent spectra decreases and then increases as the mass accretion rate increases ( see fig .",

    "this is a specific property of bh spectra .",
    "this type of behavior of @xmath1 vs @xmath0 ( or vs photon index ) has been recently discovered by @xcite in _ rxte _ observations of xte j1550 - 564 .",
    "note the decrease of the spectral efold energy vs mass accretion rate occurs when the high energy photons formed in the converging flow are not seen in the resulting spectrum . in this case , the spectral shape is only determined by thermal comptonization taking place in the outer parts of compton cloud .",
