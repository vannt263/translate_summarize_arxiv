    "the electric dipole ( e1 ) response of quantum dots has deserved much attention in recent years , mainly motivated by the measurements of far - infrared absorption in these systems @xcite .",
    "the manifestation of the so called _ magnetoplasmons _ in a perpendicularly applied magnetic field constitutes an example of collective oscillation in finite fermi systems , physically analogous to those existing in metal clusters , atoms or nuclei . in",
    "parabolically confined dots magnetoplasmons are understood as rigid motions of the electronic center of mass , a result that stems from the generalized kohn s theorem @xcite .",
    "however , deviations from parabolicity , such as angular deformations or non - quadratic radial behaviour , may result in more complicated absorption patterns which are currently being much investigated @xcite .",
    "the understanding of other excitation modes of quantum dots are also essential for a proper characterization of these systems .",
    "techniques based on resonant inelastic light scattering have already proved extremely useful to this purpose @xcite .",
    "in fact , using polarization selection rules they permit to disentangle charge - density from spin - density and single - particle excitations , as well as to discern different multipolarity peaks in each channel . the momentum transfer and magnetic field dependence of the different excitations of a single sample have been recently reported using this technique @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that theoretical analysis of the raman spectra in circularly symmetric quantum dots have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for elliptical quantum dots",
    "orbital - current modes and their relationship with the quadrupole response were analysed by us in ref .",
    "a characteristic low energy mode , depending on deformation and with a conspicuous signal in the magnetic dipole ( m1 ) channel was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the relevance of orbital excitations in the build - up of the electronic moment of inertia was discussed in ref .  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the magnetic field dependence of the orbital and quadrupole modes , a necessary step to understand the m1 and e2 responses in deformed dots and towards the description of raman scattering in symmetry unrestricted nanostructures .",
    "it will be shown that four excitation modes with @xmath0-dependent energies and strengths characterize both m1 and e2 reponses in elliptic dots .",
    "this result follows from analytical calculations in the so - called non - interacting deformed - harmonic - oscillator ( nidho ) model , as well as for interacting electrons in the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "therefore , it constitutes a robust picture against interactions in a somewhat similar way as kohn s modes are .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii is devoted to the nidho model for m1 and e2 responses ; in sec .",
    "iii we present the time - dependent lsda results for the same channels ; finally , sec .",
    "iv presents the conclusions .",
    "we consider a system of non - interacting electrons , confined to the @xmath1 plane by an anisotropic parabola @xcite @xmath2 the mean parabola coefficient @xmath3 is parametrized as usual , in terms of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath4 and electron number @xmath5 as @xmath6 . in the following",
    "we shall label the dot deformation with the parameter @xmath7 ( ranging from 0 to 1 ) . taking into account a uniform magnetic field @xmath8",

    "the last piece is the zeeman term , depending on the total spin @xmath12 and the effective gyromagnetic factor @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "obviously this is a one - electron picture , in which the relevant one - electron hamiltonian is @xmath14 .",
    "because of the magnetic field , the spatial part @xmath15 deviates from a simple harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "namely @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the new parabola coefficients , given in terms of the cyclotron frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the nontrivial problem posed by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) has been elegantly solved in an analytical way , by dippel _",
    "_ @xcite and madhav and chakraborty @xcite in the context of atomic physics and quantum dots , respectively . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the derivation by dippel _",
    "et al._. they introduce a similarity transformation to a new hamiltonian @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are chosen in order to obtain two decoupled oscillators in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions @xmath26 the reader is addressed to ref .",
    "@xcite for the detailed expressions of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in terms of the original hamiltonian parameters .",
    "most importantly , we can now express the eigenstates of @xmath15 in terms of those of @xmath31 .",
    "the latter are simply products of one - dimensional oscillator functions with a given number of quanta , i.e. , @xmath32 while the eigenstates of @xmath15 are given by @xmath33 notice that the energy eigenvalues of @xmath15 coincide with those of @xmath31 and that they are @xmath34 having the one - electron states it is then a simple matter to obtain the @xmath5 electron ground state of the nidho model just by filling the @xmath5 lower energy orbitals .      the excitations within the nidho model will correspond to independent particle - hole ( ph ) transitions in the level scheme of the ground state . taking the orbital angular momentum @xmath35 as excitation operator the m1 strength function will be given by @xmath36 where we have denoted the electron states @xmath37 as @xmath38 and the occupation numbers are given by the @xmath39 factors .    to evaluate the matrix element in eq",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) we first need to obtain the transformed operator .",
    "this can be accomplished by using the baker - haussdorf lemma for unitary transformations @xcite , which introduces a nested conmutators expansion",
    ". a straightforward calculation yields @xmath40 position and momentum operators may now be transformed to creation and anihilation ones @xmath41 with similar relations for @xmath25 and @xmath42 in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the matrix elements are therefore written in terms of the creation and anihilation operator ones @xmath45    from the calculation",
    "it emerges that there are only four allowed transition energies : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 whose m1 strengths are @xmath50 result ( [ eq12 ] ) provides a clear interpretation of the different modes : @xmath51 corresponds to the absorption of two @xmath24-oscillator quanta , @xmath52 absorbs two @xmath25 quanta while @xmath53 takes one quantum in each oscillator .",
    "by contrast , @xmath54 is associated with the absorption of one @xmath24 quantum accompanied with the emission of a @xmath25 quantum .",
    "we remind the reader that our convention ( @xmath55 ) renders the absorption of a @xmath25 quantum accompanied by the emission of an @xmath24 quantum energetically forbidden .",
    "figure 1 depicts the absorption energies and associated intensities @xmath56 as a function of the magnetic field for different deformations in a quantum dot with @xmath57 electrons and @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , when the system is just slightly deformed ( @xmath60 corresponds to the circular case ) ,",
    "only the @xmath53 mode is active at low @xmath0 s . as the magnetic field",
    "is increased , very rapidly the @xmath51 and @xmath52 modes gain strength and disperse in energy .",
    "eventually , for very large magnetic fields @xmath52 becomes the lowest energy mode and carries most of the strength .",
    "the @xmath54 mode deserves a special discussion .",
    "deformed dots at low deformation and magnetic field are characterized by the same oscillator occupancy numbers of the corresponding circular limit . in the case of magic number dots ( @xmath61 with @xmath62 an integer number specifying the last occuppied shell ) the @xmath63 , @xmath64 ph transitions",
    "are pauli - blocked thus completely inhibiting the @xmath54 mode .",
    "this excitation is switched on ( with a sudden increase in strength ) only when the deformation or @xmath0 are high enough to break the closed shell structure , which takes place in first instance when @xmath65 figure 2 displays the regions in the @xmath66 plane in which the @xmath54 mode is active , for different dot sizes .",
    "this effect is absent for non - magic electron numbers since there is no pauli blocking for these systems and , as a consequence , @xmath54 is active at all @xmath67 and @xmath0 . for @xmath68 , 20 ,  , subsequent changes in the ground state level structure give also rise to enhancements of the @xmath54 strength by allowing an increasing number of ph transitions .",
    "the mechanism discussed here is also responsible for strong enhancements of the moment of inertia in these systems @xcite .    the general situation in fig .",
    "1 is qualitatively very similar for the deformations @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we remark however that for @xmath71 the _ splitting _ @xmath72 is higher at low @xmath0 and the @xmath54 mode switches on at a smaller magnetic field . for large deformations ( @xmath73 )",
    "the @xmath54 mode is active even at @xmath74 .",
    "notice also that the splitting @xmath72 is so high that @xmath52 approaches @xmath54 at vanishing magnetic fields .",
    "a common feature to all deformations is that @xmath52 dominates the response at high @xmath0 s .",
    "altogether , the nidho model provides a quite interesting scenario of the m1 channel , with the emergence of novel modes and big strength transfers between them as a function of the magnetic field and deformation .",
    "the e2 strength is given in terms of the quadrupole operator @xmath1 by @xmath75 in a way similar to the m1 analysis we may obtain the e2 matrix elements . after a straightforward calculation one finds the same four modes of the m1 channel manisfesting in the e2 spectra , although with different strengths ( see third column in fig  1 ) .",
    "the detailed expressions are @xmath76    we notice that the share of strength as a function of the magnetic field and deformation is similar to the magnetic dipole case .",
    "several differences may , however , be remarked .",
    "firstly , the @xmath53 mode is relatively enhanced for all @xmath67 and @xmath0 as compared to the results for the m1 channel .",
    "for instance the intensity ratio @xmath77 is enhanced by a factor @xmath78 at @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is also worth to point out that the @xmath51 and @xmath52 intensities are reverted with respect to the m1 result .",
    "finally , at large magnetic fields the low energy @xmath52 mode is no longer the dominant one since both @xmath51 and @xmath54 show a higher intensity .    as remarked above the number of electrons in fig .",
    "1 ( @xmath57 ) corresponds at low deformations @xmath79 to a closed shell quantum dot .",
    "when analysing the m1 and e2 responses of dots that correspond to open shells in the circular limit the results are quite similar to those in this figure , but with the important difference that the @xmath54 mode is already active at @xmath74 since pauli blocking is not effective in this case .",
    "to analyze the role of electron - electron interactions in a microscopic formalism we resort to the lsda version of density functional theory .",
    "this theory provides a practical way to include electronic exchange and correlation effects by relying on exact calculations for the uniform electron gas . at different levels ,",
    "density functional theory has been applied by many authors to describe the ground state @xcite and excitations of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the most refined version is the so - called current - density functional , first applied to quantum dots by ferconi and vignale @xcite , that was recently used to describe the edge reconstruction in these systems for large magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , current terms are known to be rather small for moderate magnetic fields and will be neglected in this work in which we shall resort to the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , developed for the treatment of noncircular nanostructures .",
    "the description of excitations in deformed nanostructures constitutes a highly nontrivial task , mainly because of the lack of symmetry not allowing the analytic integration of angular variables as in circular systems . for this reason we shall use the time - dependent lsda to obtain the time evolution , following an initial perturbation , of relevant expectation values .",
    "the set of single - particle orbitals @xmath80 evolves in time as @xmath81\\ , \\varphi_{i\\eta}({\\bf r},t)\\ ; ,    \\label{eqh}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the spin index , and total density and magnetization are given in terms of the spin densities @xmath83 , by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath86 in equation ( [ eqh ] ) contains , besides of kinetic energy , the confining @xmath87 , hartree @xmath88 and exchange - correlation @xmath89 potentials . the exchange - correlation energy density @xmath90 has been described as in refs .",
    "this technique was already used by us in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe orbital ( @xmath54 ) excitations in quantum dots at zero magnetic field .",
    "an initial perturbation of the orbitals @xmath91 models the interaction with the external field .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath92 is given in terms of a displacement field @xmath93 as @xmath94 } \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq16}\\ ] ] the appropriate fields for the m1 and e2 channels are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a small parameter that guarantees the linear regime . actually , these operators correspond to a rigid rotation ( m1 ) and a quadrupole distortion ( e2 ) of the electronic orbitals . after the initial distortion we keep track of @xmath98 or @xmath99 and",
    "a subsequent frequency analysis of the signal provides the absorption energies and their associated strengths @xcite .",
    "figure 3 summarizes the m1 and e2 spectra of the @xmath57 electron dot within time - dependent lsda .",
    "quite remarkably many features of the nidho model are also present in the lsda spectra .",
    "in fact we can identify the four modes , labeled in fig .  3 by analogy with the nidho results ,",
    "although in general they lie at different energies because of the interactions .    focusing on the m1 channel , we notice for @xmath69 the emergence of the low energy mode @xmath54 and its crossing with the @xmath52 mode .",
    "this crossing takes place at @xmath100  t for both @xmath69 and @xmath71 and at @xmath101  t for @xmath73 .",
    "the dominance of @xmath52 at large @xmath0 s is also in very good agreement with the nidho prediction .",
    "quite remarkably , for @xmath71 the @xmath54 mode is switched on even at @xmath74 as a result of the interactions . at @xmath73 the closeness of @xmath52 and @xmath54 at low magnetic fields predicted in the non - interacting case is nicely seen in fig .",
    "it is also worth to mention the strong quenching of the @xmath51 mode within lsda .",
    "the e2 results also reflect to a great extent the systematics predicted by the nidho model . in general the high energy modes @xmath53 and @xmath51 are more important in the e2 spectra than in the m1 ones , especially at large magnetic fields . in some cases",
    "the lsda strengths show some small fragmentations that we attribute to ph effects ( landau damping ) .",
    "for instance , this is quite clear in the @xmath51 mode at 3 and 4 teslas .",
    "the m1 and e2 channels of elliptic quantum dots are characterized by four modes whose energies and strengths vary with magnetic field and deformation .",
    "their main characteristics are already seen in a non - interacting model , although interactions shift the mode energies and introduce several minor differences .",
    "the main trends seen in figs .  1 - 3 may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "three modes @xmath51 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 have a positive dispersion relation with @xmath0 while the other @xmath52 exhibits a negative one . at low magnetic fields and deformations @xmath51 , @xmath53 and @xmath52",
    "are very close , while @xmath54 lies at a much lower energy . as the deformation",
    "is increased the three upper modes separate in energy ( at @xmath102 ) , the lower of them @xmath52 coming close to @xmath54 .",
    "2 .   at low @xmath0",
    "s the m1 strength of closed shell dots is exhausted by @xmath53 while , when increasing the deformation @xmath54 is also active .",
    "this mode is also switched on when increasing the magnetic field for a fixed deformation as a consequence of the pauli blocking mechanism .",
    "generally , a crossing between @xmath54 and @xmath52 occurs for intermediate magnetic fields . at large magnetic fields the low energy @xmath52 mode eventually takes all the strength .",
    "the e2 spectra are similar to the m1 ones , although an important amount of strength shifts to the high energy modes @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath51 as compared to the magnetic dipole channel .",
    "contrary to the m1 case the e2 absorption does not show a clear dominant peak at high @xmath0 s .",
    "unless stated otherwise , we shall use effective atomic units ( for which @xmath103 , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 the dielectric constant and electron effective mas , respectively ) corresponding to gaas values , i.e. , h@xmath106 mev , @xmath107  and @xmath108 fs , as energy , length and time units ."
