    "the gravitational role of vacuum fluctuations is a challenging problem in field theory and cosmology , as vacuum is in general not uniquely defined in curved spacetimes and its energy density usually depends on the renormalization procedure . in the case of",
    "free ( conformal ) fields in de sitter spacetime , the renormalized vacuum density is @xmath3 @xcite . in a low - energy universe",
    "this leads to a too tiny cosmological term . in the high energy limit",
    "it can be used to obtain a non - singular model , with an initial quasi - de sitter universe giving origin to a radiation era , through a phase transition in which vacuum decays into relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "the primordial perturbations generated in this process are not scale invariant and a subsequent inflation is still needed @xcite .    in order to see how this non - singular scenario emerges , let us take @xmath4 , which is valid in de sitter space - time owing to its maximal symmetry .",
    "the conservation equation @xmath5 assumes the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the total energy and pressure , respectively , and the dot means derivative w.r.t .",
    "the cosmological time @xmath9 .",
    "we see that a time - varying vacuum density is concomitant with particle production .",
    "let us now take @xmath10 and the relativistic equation of state @xmath11 for matter .",
    "( [ noconservation ] ) and the friedmann equation @xmath12 lead to @xmath13 apart from the trivial solution @xmath14 , this equation has the solution @xmath15 where a constant of integration was conveniently chosen .",
    "this solution , which tends to de sitter in the asymptotic past , is plotted in fig .",
    "we then see that de sitter solution is not stable in the high energy limit , evolving to a radiation dominated universe , with vacuum decaying into relativistic matter ( it is easy to see from ( [ h4 ] ) that , when @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 , which characterises a radiation phase ) .",
    "as we will see , this process involves a backreaction that eventually changes the solution ( [ h4 ] ) , leading to a subsequent inflation era .    .",
    "]    to clarify these results , let us revisit the seminal work by gibbons and hawking @xcite on the thermodynamics of de sitter spacetime .",
    "they show that an observer in a de sitter background experience a thermal bath of temperature @xmath18 , which they have interpreted as a thermal radiation emitted from the observer event horizon .",
    "the absortion of this radiation by the observer detector leads to a shrinking in the horizon area , which is interpreted as resulting from a decrease in the entropy beyond the horizon .",
    "nevertheless , that original analysis does not consider the backreaction associated to the particle creation .",
    "as discussed above , the corresponding energy density and pressure obey , owing to the symmetry of de sitter space , the equation of state @xmath4 , where @xmath19 is the effective cosmological term which defines the de sitter horizon . leading this into the conservation equation for the total energy ( [ conservation ] ) , we obtain equation ( [ noconservation ] ) .",
    "as already said , it shows that the particle creation ( that is , its absortion from the thermal bath ) is only possible if @xmath19 decays with time , with a consequent increase in the horizon area .",
    "this may be understood on the light of a reinterpretation of the gibbons - hawking thermal bath as resulting from the vacuum quantum fluctuations which originate the cosmological term .",
    "the horizon entropy gives the number of degrees of freedom ( inside the horizon ) associated to those fluctuations , and its increase just means that the extraction of particles from vacuum is an irreversible process .",
    "this interpretation is in better accordance with modern formulations of the holographic principle , as we will see below .    in this paper",
    "we shall explore the effect of the particle creation backreaction on the solution ( [ h4 ] ) presented above .",
    "we will show that it leads to an inflation solution with a scale invariant primordial spectrum .",
    "furthermore , by assuming that inflation lasts for approximately @xmath1 e - folds , we will be able to obtain the scalar spectral index currently observed , @xmath2 .",
    "however , before doing that , let us consider in the next section the role of particle creation in the opposite , low - energy limit of late times .",
    "we will see that it may also be responsible for the present cosmic acceleration , giving origin to a decaying vacuum term as well .",
    "in the case we consider the vacuum energy of interacting fields , it has been suggested that in a low energy , approximately de sitter background the vacuum condensate originated from the qcd phase transition leads to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 mev is the energy scale of the transition @xcite .",
    "this result is in fact intuitive . in a de sitter background",
    "the energy per observable degree of freedom is given by the temperature of the horizon , @xmath22 .",
    "for a massless free field this energy is disbributed in a volume @xmath23 , leading to a density @xmath3 , as above . for a strongly interacting field in a low energy space - time ,",
    "on the other hand , the occupied volume is @xmath24 , owing to confinement , and the expected density is @xmath20 .",
    "such a late - time variation law for the vacuum term can also be derived as a backreaction of non - relativistic , light dark particles production in the expanding spacetime . indeed ,",
    "vacuum fluctuations of a particle of mass @xmath25 have a lifetime @xmath26 , longer than the hubble time , being then observed as real particles irreversibly produced at a constant rate @xmath27 .",
    "we can also describe this process by saying that , as the wavelength of the fluctuations is greater than the horizon radius @xmath28 , one of the particles in the pair scapes to the zone beyond the horizon , while the other appears as a created particle .",
    "if @xmath29 , the produced particles are non - relativistic ( photons are not produced in the low - energy regime , because there exist no one - loop photon fluctuations ) , and the boltzmann equation for this process is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the particle number density . by taking @xmath32 ,",
    "it can also be written as @xmath33    the particle production necessarily involves a backreaction .",
    "let us take , in addition to ( [ conservacao1 ] ) , the friedmann equation @xmath34 if our background is approximately de sitter , the vacuum pressure is @xmath4 . using ( [ conservacao1 ] ) and ( [ friedmann ] ) we obtain the conservation equation for the total energy , @xmath35 provided we take @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant of integration . since there is no natural scale for this constant , let us make it zero .",
    "then we have @xmath38 .",
    "this is the time - variation law predicted for the vacuum density of the qcd condensate , with @xmath39 . dividing it by @xmath40",
    ", we obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the relative matter density ( for simplicity , we are considering only the spatially flat case ) . in the de sitter limit ( @xmath43 )",
    ", we have @xmath44 , that is , the creation rate is equal ( apart from a numerical factor ) to the thermal bath temperature predicted by gibbons and hawking .",
    "it also means that the scale of the future de sitter horizon is determined , through @xmath45 , by the energy scale of the qcd phase transition , the last cosmological transition we have .    for the present time we have from ( [ winfried ] )",
    "( with @xmath46 ) @xmath47 , and hence @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the current hubble parameter .",
    "the former result is an expression of the eddington - dirac large number coincidence @xcite .",
    "the later - also known as zeldovich s relation @xcite - gives the correct order of magnitude for @xmath19 .",
    "we also have @xmath50ev .",
    "note that this is the quantum of mass expected on the basis of the holography conjecture applied to de sitter spacetime . according to the holographic principle @xcite , the number of states inside the de sitter horizon is given by the horizon area , @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy inside the horizon is @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the energy per degree of freedom is @xmath53 .",
    "as we have seen , in the de sitter limit this quantum of energy is equal to the horizont temperature . by the way ,",
    "let us remark that this tiny value for @xmath54 suggests that dark particles may be associated to pseudo - goldstone bosons of the qcd condensate , with a dynamically generated mass given by the inverse of the scale of the de sitter horizon .",
    "( the cosmological role of an ultra - light pseudo nambu - goldstone boson with mass @xmath55 was already considered before , in another context @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding cosmological model has a simple analytical solution , which reduces to the cdm model for early times and to a de sitter universe for @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "it has the same free parameters of the standard model and presents good concordance when tested against type ia supernovas , baryonic acoustic oscillations , the position of the first peak of cmb and the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in @xcite , the coincidence problem is alleviated , because the matter density contrast is suppressed in the asymptotic future , owing to the matter production . in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 we show the concordance in the @xmath57 space for those four observations . we consider the sdss compilation of supernovas ia calibrated with the mlcs2k2 fitter , since it is less dependent on a fiducial @xmath19cdm model than other supernovae samples . for the large scale structure ( lss )",
    "distribution we use the 2dfgrs data .",
    "we obtain for the present hubble parameter @xmath58 km / s - mpc , and marginalizing over it does not alter the matter density concordance value , @xmath59 .",
    "the best - fit universe age is @xmath60 gyr .",
    "these results do not change if we use for supernovas ia the constitution sample compilated with mlcs2k2 @xcite .    for the sake of comparison we show in the left panel the concordance region ( with lss excluded ) for the spatially flat @xmath19cdm model with the sdss ( mlcs2k2 ) supernovae sample .",
    "the best - fit hubble parameter is the same as in the @xmath19(t ) model .",
    "however , as already pointed out in the literature , in this case there is a tension between the sdss best - fit value for the matter density ( @xmath61 ) and the value obtained from the lss analysis ( @xmath62 ) @xcite .",
    "concordance region .",
    "sne ia , bao and cmb @xmath63 confidence regions for the spatially flat @xmath19cdm model @xcite . ]",
    "concordance region .",
    "sne ia , bao and cmb @xmath63 confidence regions for the spatially flat @xmath19cdm model @xcite . ]",
    "let us return to the early - time limit of high energy densities . in this case",
    "the particles are relativistic , with an average energy @xmath64 . that this is the typical energy of any degree of freedom , including vacuum fluctuations ,",
    "can be seen by applying again the holographic principle @xcite to a de sitter ( or quasi - de sitter ) spacetime .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom inside the de sitter horizon is proportional to its surface , @xmath65 , while the total energy inside the horizon is @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the energy per degree of freedom is @xmath67 .",
    "another way to support this result is remembering that a temperature @xmath18 can be associated to the de sitter background .",
    "the lifetime of a vacuum fluctuation is now given by @xmath68 . if it is a bit longer than @xmath28 , we have relativistic particles production at a rate @xmath69 .",
    "the boltzmann equation has now the form @xmath70 where @xmath31 is the particle number density and @xmath71 is a constant of the order of unity . in an approximately de sitter spacetime ( where @xmath72 constant ) ,",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath73 where @xmath11 .",
    "equations ( [ conservacao ] ) and ( [ conservacao1 ] ) are characteristic of models with interaction in the dark sector @xcite .",
    "again , the particle production involves a backreaction . from eq .",
    "( [ conservacao ] ) ( with @xmath74 ) and the friedmann equation @xmath75 we derive the conservation of the total energy , @xmath35 provided we take @xmath76 since there is no natural scale for the integration constant @xmath77 , we take it equals to zero .",
    "let us remark that a quadratic dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath0 was already considered in other contexts .",
    "for example , it can be obtained on the basis of renormalization group results @xcite .",
    "the solution for ( [ conservacao ] ) , ( [ friedmann2 ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath49 is now an integration constant .",
    "for @xmath80 we have @xmath81 .",
    "hence , for @xmath82 we have @xmath83 , that is , an approximately de sitter solution , as assumed above",
    ".    we can verify from ( [ h ] ) that @xmath84 is the slow - roll inflation parameter defined by @xmath85 . as it is constant ,",
    "the second slow - roll parameter is @xmath86 , and the scalar spectral index is @xcite @xmath87    from ( [ h ] ) we define the time when inflation ends by @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , assuming that inflation lasts for about @xmath1 e - folds , as required to solve the horizon problem , we have @xmath89 , leading to @xmath90 .",
    "this is approximately the current value obtained for the scalar spectral index from cmb observations , @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) @xcite .",
    "note that such a relation between the number of e - folds and @xmath93 is not general , holding only for models with constant @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easy to show from ( [ friedmann2 ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) that the matter relative density is @xmath94 .",
    "that is , during inflation radiation and matter represented around @xmath95 of the energy content .    up to now",
    "we have been considering @xmath71 as a constant in ( [ boltzmann ] ) .",
    "however , it actually decreases as long as @xmath0 decreases , because the production of a particle species stops when @xmath0 crosses the threshold of the particle mass .",
    "eventually @xmath71 goes to zero , hence we have @xmath96 and , for @xmath97 , it follows from ( [ h ] ) that @xmath17 , which characterises a radiation phase , with @xmath98 . as for the ultra - light dark particles considered above ,",
    "their production starts after the qcd phase transition , but they are subdominant during the radiation phase @xcite .",
    "the energy scale of inflation ( given by the integration constant @xmath49 in ( [ h ] ) ) is not determined in this model .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that it is above the electroweak scale , in which case all the observed particles are produced .",
    "the planck scale ( @xmath99 ) is a natural superior limit , at which the ansatz @xmath3 discussed at the beginning is valid . in this case inflation",
    "would take place at the end of the non - singular quasi - de sitter phase .    as in this model",
    "we have two interacting fluids , namely the vacuum term and relativistic matter , the presence of entropic perturbations must be investigated .",
    "supposing that both components have no intrinsic non - adiabatic perturbations , the only entropic contribution is given by @xcite @xmath100 where a hat means perturbation of a given quantity .",
    "owing to its equation of state , @xmath74 , the vacuum component perturbation is negligible for scales inside the horizon @xcite . therefore , the relative entropic perturbation ( [ nadtot1 ] ) reduces to @xmath101 where in the last approximation we have used the fact that , during the inflationary phase , @xmath102 .",
    "the non - adiabatic perturbations are then proportional to @xmath103 , and their presence does not affect the scale - invariance of the primordial espectrum .    in reference",
    "@xcite , both the planck limit @xmath3 and the low - energy result @xmath104 were also modeled , alternatively , by a self - interacting scalar field , with the interaction potential @xmath105 playing the role of a decaying vacuum term , and the kinetic term @xmath106 representing produced stiff matter .",
    "let us show that we can do the same here , that is , we can model this inflationary scenario by introducing an equivalent inflaton field .",
    "the field equations are @xcite @xmath107 @xmath108 where the prime means derivative with respect to @xmath109 . from equation ( [ lambda ] ) we see that , in this case , @xmath110 . the solution is then given by @xmath111 @xmath112 where now @xmath113 .",
    "the first equation is , apart a re - scaling of time , the same solution ( [ h ] ) obtained before .",
    "the second equation gives , for @xmath81 ( that is , @xmath80 ) , an approximately constant potential @xmath114 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath115 .",
    "this guarantees that we have a slow - roll inflation , with a scale - invariant spectrum @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "it also means that , as asserted above , the perturbations in the potential ( i.e. , in the vacuum term ) are negligible , since @xmath117 .",
    "the potential ( [ potential ] ) was also considered by @xcite in the context of a model with particle creation .",
    "particle creation is something expected in expanding spacetimes @xcite . in spite of the difficulty in deriving the production rate and backreaction in general , this phenomenon may in principle be related with inflation and the present cosmic acceleration , a possibility already considered in different ways by some authors @xcite .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the production of non - relativistic , ultra - light dark particles at late times leads to a concordance model in which the vacuum density decays with time . in the limit of high energies , on the other hand",
    ", we have shown that the production of relativistic particles from the vacuum leads to a viable inflationary solution .",
