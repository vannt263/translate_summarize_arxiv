    ", we have learned that a large fraction of cosmic star formation is hidden by dust ( e.g. , barger et al .",

    "2005 ; chapman et al .  2005 ; wang et al .",
    "2006 ; serjeant et al .",
    "2008 ) , and hence that the construction of a complete picture of galaxy evolution also requires an understanding of fir and submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "however , the challenge in studying the properties of this important population of galaxies in detail has always been the low resolution of the fir / submillimeter / millimeter data , which makes it difficult to identify the correct counterparts and to carry out follow - up observations .",
    "one popular approach for pinpointing smgs has been to use deep radio interferometric images .",
    "this approach takes advantage of the well - known tight empirical correlation between non - thermal radio emission and thermal dust emission ( e.g. , helou et al .  1985 ; condon 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , about 60%@xmath1270% of bright ( @xmath13  mjy ) smgs are found to have radio counterparts above 20  cm flux limits of @xmath14jy ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "2000 ; ivison et al .",
    "2002 ; chapman et al .",
    "2003b ) . with the subarcsec positional accuracy of the radio data , it has been possible to follow up a number of these bright smgs spectroscopically .",
    "chapman et al .",
    "( 2003a , 2005 ) found a redshift distribution between @xmath15 for these sources .",
    "we note in passing that mid - infrared ( mir ) data from _",
    "spitzer _ are also commonly used to identify counterparts to smgs ( e.g. , pope et al .",
    "2006 ) , but the resolution of these data is lower ( @xmath16 resolution for irac ; the 24  @xmath0 m mips catalogs usually require irac source positions as priors ) than in the radio . more recently , _ herschel_-pacs data ( beam sizes of @xmath17 and @xmath18 at 100  @xmath0 m and 160  @xmath0 m , respectively ) have been used ( e.g. , dannerbauer et al .",
    "finally , hard x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ can also identify dusty active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( e.g. , bautz et al .",
    "2000 ; severgnini et al .",
    "2000 ; barger et al .",
    "2001a , b ; alexander et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are several drawbacks to using radio emission to identify smgs .",
    "first , with the current sensitivity of radio interferometers ( @xmath19 of @xmath20jy at 20  cm prior to the upgrade of the karl g. jansky very large array or vla , e.g. , fomalont et al .",
    "2006 ; owen & morrison 2008 ; morrison et al .",
    "2010 ; wold et al .",
    "2012 ; and now @xmath19 of @xmath21jy with the upgrade , e.g. , f. owen et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ; hereafter , owen13 ) ,",
    "the radio - identified smgs are mostly bright in the submillimeter , so their properties may not be representative of smgs as a whole .",
    "second , the radio flux drops at high redshifts due to the positive @xmath22-correction of the radio synchrotron emission , while the submillimeter flux remains almost invariant over the redshift range @xmath23 ( blain & longair 1993 ) due to the negative @xmath22-correction of the submillimeter thermal dust emission .",
    "compton cooling on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation may also significantly reduce the 20  cm emission in the highest redshift sources ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "thus , the radio identification technique is biased against high - redshift sources .",
    "finally , a number of smgs have been found to have more than one candidate radio counterpart ( e.g. , ivison et al .",
    "2002 , 2007 ; pope et al .  2006 ) , making identifying the correct counterpart to the smg or determining whether there may be multiple counterparts difficult .",
    "high - resolution interferometric imaging at the wavelength of the original detection is clearly a more reliable way to identify the correct counterparts to smgs .",
    "it is also a way to confirm that an smg is real rather than a false positive .",
    "this is particularly important when counterparts at other wavelengths can not be found , since then the source could be interpreted as being at a very high redshift when it is in fact not real .",
    "observations with the submillimeter array ( sma ; ho et al .",
    "2004 ) have proven to be very useful for localizing the submillimeter emission from scuba sources ( e.g. , iono et al .",
    "2006 ; wang et al .  2007 , 2011 ; younger et al .  2008 ; cowie et al .  2009 ; hatsukade et al .  2010 ; knudsen et al .  2010 ; chen et al .  2011 ) , as have millimeter observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) using either continuum emission ( e.g. , downes et al .  1999 ; dannerbauer et al .",
    "2008 ) or co molecular line emission ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "2009a , b ; walter et al .  2012 ) . indeed , through the above studies of the scuba sources and other studies made using various telescope and instrument combinations ( e.g. , capak et al .  2008 , 2011 ; schinnerer et al .  2008 ; coppin et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; riechers et al .  2010 ; smoli et al .  2011 ) , the redshift distribution of smgs has now been extended to @xmath24 .    moreover , the sma observations have successfully discriminated between multiple plausible counterparts identified at other wavebands .",
    "for example , in several cases , only one of the multiple candidate radio counterparts was found to be the source of the submillimeter emission ( younger et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , 2009 ; hatsukade et al .  2010 ) .    however , perhaps the most interesting and important result to come out of the limited number of existing sma interferometric localizations is the discovery that some of the brighter scuba sources resolve into multiple , physically unrelated smgs ( wang et al .",
    "the wang et al .",
    "results reinforce the notion that cross - identifications of the dusty galaxies at any wavelength other than the submillimeter can be misleading , since such identifications are typically based on only one of the real counterparts .",
    "thus , the redshift distribution of the dusty star formation may need to be revised .",
    "for the last few years , we have been observing with the sma the @xmath1 sample of scuba - identified smgs with 850  @xmath0 m fluxes @xmath2  mjy in the great observatories origins deep survey - north ( goods - n ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) presented by wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter , w04 ; see their table  1 ) .",
    "there are 16 such sources listed in the w04 table .",
    "most of these sources are also in the scuba super - map catalog of pope et al .",
    "( 2005 ; see their table  a1 ) .",
    "w04 used the naming convention ( prefix ) goods  850 , while p05 used the naming convention ( prefix ) gn for goods - n .",
    "in addition , some of the sources in the hubble deep field - north proper ( hdf - n ; williams et al .",
    "1996 ) appeared in the hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discovery paper , where they used the naming convention ( prefix ) hdf  850 . for clarity and ease of comparison with the literature , where there are overlaps",
    ", we always give all relevant names .",
    "note that the reason we imposed the @xmath2  mjy flux limit is because anything fainter than this is too hard to do with the sensitivity of the sma .",
    "applying this flux limit only removed goods 850 - 10 ( gn  13 or hdf  850.4 ) from the @xmath3 sample of w04 , where it is listed as having a scuba flux of @xmath25  mjy .",
    "many recent analyses have focused on large samples of submillimeter or millimeter galaxies , which usually come at the expense of being heterogeneously selected , not uniformly of high significance , and often without high - resolution submillimeter or millimeter imaging . as a consequence , some of the sources may not be real or may have overestimated submillimeter fluxes , while others may be multiples and/or have their counterparts misidentified .",
    "it is well - known in the literature that using lower significance thresholds is very dangerous due to the increased contamination from flux boosting ( e.g. , eddington 1913 ; eales et al .",
    "2000 ; scott et al .  2002 ; wang et al .",
    "moreover , as shown by wang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , multiple sources can blend in single - dish observations to form a single , apparently more luminous source , the components of which may not even be physically related .",
    "these recent analyses are orthogonal to the philosophy of the present paper , which is to concentrate on an extremely well - understood sample of uniformly selected smgs at the expense of the sample being relatively small . here",
    "we analyze our targeted sma sample as a whole .",
    "we have already published a few of our sma sources in previous work . in wang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we presented goods  850 - 11 ( gn  12 ) and goods  850 - 13 ( gn  21 ) , which we found to be composed of two and three distinct and unrelated sources , respectively . in cowie",

    "scuba-2 is the most powerful camera for observing light at submillimeter wavelengths .",

    ". there may be some extremely compton - thick agns that are not picked up by the x - ray selection .",
    "however , of the 10 sources that are not x - ray agns in the sma sample , 3 are extended radio sources ( table  [ tab5 ] lists 3 ; momjian et al .",
    "2010 has goods  850 - 3 in common with table  [ tab5 ] ) , suggesting that at least in these cases the fir luminosities are primarily powered by star formation .",
    "we can now compare our sfr density history with that of hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ; we scaled their modified salpeter imf to our salpeter imf ) , a compilation that is often used as a reference ( black curve ) . at the redshifts of interest ( @xmath292 ) ,",
    "the hopkins & beacom results are based on extinction corrected ultraviolet samples using a common extinction correction .",
    "we find that the contribution of our smg sample is about 30% ( red dashed curve ) of the hopkins & beacom sfr density .",
    "our sfr density is strictly a lower limit to the contribution from the overall smg population , since we have not corrected for incompleteness in the original sample ( both missing sources in the observed flux range and sources that lie below the 3  mjy flux limit ) .",
    "however , even the present results show that over the redshift range @xmath34 , a large and relatively invariant fraction of the overall sfr density is contained in these massively star - forming galaxies .",
    "it should be emphasized that the present star - forming galaxies will only be partly included in an extinction - corrected ultraviolet selected sample , such as that of hopkins & beacom . excluding goods  850 - 17 , where the neighboring bright galaxy contaminates the photometry , 7 of the 15 sources have f850lp magnitudes fainter than 26 , 4 of which are not detected at all in the goods acs data .",
    "thus , roughly half of the star formation seen in this sma sample would not have been included in an ultraviolet star formation estimate .",
    "thus , determinations of the star formation history from extinction - corrected ultraviolet selected populations and from smg - selected populations are only partially overlapping and need to be combined , allowing for the overlap .",
    "in this paper , we presented our extremely sensitive ( sub - mjy rms ) sma 860  @xmath0 m continuum imaging survey of a complete sample of highly significant ( @xmath1 ) scuba 850  @xmath0 m sources with fluxes above 3  mjy that were detected in the w04 survey of the goods - n . using our sma observations , as well as scuba-2 observations of the field obtained by c13",
    ", we did not detect 4 of the sources in the sample , and we ruled out the original scuba fluxes for those sources at the @xmath3 level . using the scuba-2 data , we also did not detect a similar number of highly significant sources in the p05 scuba sample .",
    "it is quite common in the literature to see studies that include smgs detected at significances lower than @xmath3 ; however , our study illustrates the dangers of including such sources and emphasizes the need for caution even when analyzing highly significant scuba samples , if there are are no confirming submillimeter data available .",
    "more intriguingly , we found that 3 of the scuba sources in the sample resolved into multiple , fainter smgs .",
    "we concluded that the positional accuracy that one obtains from interferometric submillimeter or millimeter observations is absolutely critical for making correct counterpart identifications and that those identifications made at wavebands far from the detection waveband or using low spatial resolution data may be highly misleading .",
    "we used new ultradeep 20  cm data of the field obtained by owen13 with the upgraded vla to find @xmath5 radio counterparts to all of the sources in our sma sample .",
    "we used these data to estimate millimetric redshifts , though we found that the bulk of the sources in our sample ( 10/16 ) already had spectroscopic redshifts in the literature .",
    "we constructed seds for a clean sample of 5 smgs that were isolated ( so accurate flux measurements could be made ) and had _ herschel _ data , which provided the critical measurements at the peak of the thermal dust spectrum .",
    "we found these seds to be very similar to that of the local ulirg arp  220 .    using the seds , we measured fir luminosities for the 5 smgs over the wavelength range 42.5 - 122.5  @xmath0 m covered by the data .",
    "we used these fir luminosities together with the radio power of the sources to determine @xmath33 , the usual parameterization of the fir - radio correlation , for each source .",
    "we included one additional source at @xmath26 , whose 860  @xmath0 m flux is close enough to the peak of the thermal dust spectrum to be strongly constraining of @xmath33 , even without _ herschel _ data , and saw it was also consistent with no evolution in the fir - radio correlation with redshift .",
    "our sample is not subject to the radio bias that has plagued many earlier studies on this topic .",
    "we found that our sources had @xmath33 values consistent with the local range out to redshifts beyond 5 .    with the detection of our entire sma sample in the radio and the advantage of having a high fraction of spectroscopic redshifts",
    ", we were able to measure the evolution of the sfr density with redshift for our sample and compare it with that determined from ultraviolet - selected populations .",
    "these are the first reliable measurements at high redshifts , since previous results have been highly biased against such objects due to the radio selection needed to localize the sources .",
    "we found that the contribution from our sample to the overall sfr density is a substantial and fairly invariant fraction of about 30% of the hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) extinction - corrected ultraviolet selected compilation over the redshift range @xmath34 . we emphasize that determinations of the star formation history from extinction - corrected ultraviolet selected populations and from smg - selected populations are only partially overlapping , due to the extreme ultraviolet faintness of some of the smgs .",
