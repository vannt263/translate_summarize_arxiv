    "the idea to use scintillating fibers for charged - particle tracking is not new .",
    "several experiments have already successfully built and used scintillating fiber trackers in high - energy and astro - particle physics .",
    "d  _ experiment @xcite for example chose to use a scintillating fiber tracker built from @xmath3 thick , multi - clad scintillating fibers , read out by _ visible - light photon counters _ ( vlpc ) .",
    "the mice experiment took the idea of a scintillating fiber tracker one step further , using @xmath4 thin multiclad fibers , also read out by vlpcs .",
    "the use of vlpcs requires a significant overhead , because they have to be operated in cryostats at temperatures of around @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore propose a new detector design , using @xmath6 thin fibers , read out by _ silicon photomultipliers ( sipm ) _ that can be used very effectively with only moderate cooling .",
    "a sipm is a relatively new kind of multipixel semiconductor photodiode that achieves a high intrinsic gain by being operated above its breakdown voltage@xcite .",
    "sipms have a high photodetection efficiency of up to @xmath7 , exceeding that of regular photomultiplier tubes .",
    "in addition , they scale to small dimensions , allowing for a compact readout of thin scintillating fibers .    major distributors of sipm are hamamatsu@xcite , japan and photonique@xcite , switzerland .",
    "photonique sipm of type sspm-0606exp and sspm-050701gr were used during the beamtest of a scifi / sipm tracker prototype .",
    "sipm from photonique reach the peak sensitivity at around @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the type sspm-050701gr has a very high internal gain greater than @xmath9 while showing a dark count rate of around @xmath10 at room temperature and about @xmath11 at @xmath12 at the recommended operating voltage of typically @xmath13 .",
    "its photodetection efficiency at @xmath14 is @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the type photonique sspm-0606exp , which does not have any protective epoxy layers on top of the device , exhibits a photodetection efficiency of about @xmath16 at a pixel density of 556 pixels per @xmath17 .",
    "the gain of the sspm-0606exp device is about @xmath18 .",
    "the noise of this device is about 5 times higher than that of the sspm-050701gr device .",
    "the hamamatsu model mppc s10361 - 025u has an extremely high pixel density of @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting low geometrical fill factor of @xmath20 significantly limits the photodetection efficiency to about @xmath15 at @xmath14 .",
    "hamamatsu also offers a model s10361 - 100u with only 100 pixels per @xmath17 and a geometrical fill factor close to @xmath21 that offers a photodetection efficiency of @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the dark noise rate of the tested hamamatsu mppc s10361 - 025u is @xmath22 at @xmath23 and around @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "the prototype ( see fig .",
    "3 ) consisted of @xmath26 square , multiclad fibers of type bicron@xcite bcf-20 with white ema coating and photonique sipms of type sspm-050701gr and of type sspm-0606exp .",
    "the peak emission wavelength of bcf-20 fibers is at @xmath27 , matching the peak sensitivity of photonique sspm-0606exp sipm ( see fig .",
    "the scintillating fibers were arranged in two ribbons of @xmath28 fibers .",
    "the fiber ribbons were stabilized using glue as an adhesive .",
    "both ends of the 3-fiber ribbons were glued into a plastic connector and polished .",
    "one end was connected to a sipm by mounting it into a copper block and held in place by a aluminum frame and a spring .",
    "the sipm s were mounted into the copper - block to allow for a temperature control .",
    "part of the beam test the opposing end of the fibers was covered by a reflective foil to increase the light output for the sipms .",
    "a beam telescope with four silicon strip modules from the cms tracker project was used to measure the position of the incident particles .",
    "the silicon modules had a strip pitch of @xmath29 and an intrinsic resolution of about @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "four scintillator counters , two in front of and two behind the prototype provided the trigger with a halo counter as a veto .",
    "the beamtest of the prototype took place in a 10gev proton beam at ps , cern . during the beamtest ,",
    "1.5 million events were recorded and about 800,000 particle tracks were reconstructed with the beam telescope .",
    "the position of each fiber column was determined by reconstructing the position of particles that produced a high signal within the fiber ( see fig .",
    "the average measured distance between two fiber columns was @xmath31 with a precision of @xmath32 .",
    "the spatial resolution for particles of perpendicular incidence that pass through all three fibers of one fiber column was about @xmath33 which matches the expected intrinsic resolution of @xmath34 where d is the fiber pitch .     for the sipm signal.,width=302 ]    knowing the positions of the fibers , we determined the average photoelectron yield for particles that passed through one of the fiber columns . for particles with perpendicular incidence",
    "the average photoelectron yield for both types of sipm with and without reflective foil on the opposing fiber end was measured .",
    "the sspm-050701gr signal was about @xmath35 photoelectrons without and @xmath36 photoelectrons with reflective foil ( see fig .",
    "the sspm-0606exp achieved an average photoelectron yield of @xmath37 without reflective foil and @xmath38 with reflective foil ( omitting one sipm that actually showed a reduced photoelectron yield after adding the reflective foil ) .",
    "the measured signal - to - noise ratio was about 20 for the sspm-0606exp with reflective foil and about 100 for the sspm-050701gr with reflective foil .",
    "the mean efficiency for perpendicular incidence , setting a cut at 0.5 photoelectrons , was @xmath39 for the ribbon read out by the sspm 0606exp and @xmath40 for the sspm 050701gr .",
    "the tracker design is modular .",
    "it consists of several layers of tracker modules , each module consisting of 8 layers of scintillating fibers with 128 fibers in every layer .",
    "4 layers of fibers are glued to each side of a module core that consists of @xmath41 thick rohacell foam covered by @xmath42 thin carbon fiber skins on either side of the module ( see fig .",
    "neighboring layers are shifted by one half of the fiber pitch with respect to each other to improve the spatial resolution .",
    "sipm arrays with a sensitive area of @xmath43 and 32 readout channels , each channel covering an area of @xmath44 are used for column - wise fiber readout .",
    "the sipm arrays are mounted on alternating ends of the fiber modules along with an integrated preamplifier and digitization solution .",
    "the opposing ends of the fibers are covered by a reflective coating .",
    "width from testbeam data and monte carlo simulations .",
    "testbeam data obtained with a fiber bundle without reflective foil and photonique sspm-050701gr sipm readout are plotted using square markers .",
    "results from monte carlo simulations are added to study the behavior for improved photo electron yields .",
    "a yield of @xmath38 photo electrons was reached in the testbeam with sspm-0606exp sipms and reflective foil , but only data at @xmath45 were taken in this configuration.,width=302 ]    a dedicated monte carlo simulation , again using the geant4 package , has been developed for comparison to and generalization of the testbeam results . a key question to be answered was the spatial resolution obtained with a fiber module as a function of the mean photo electron yield @xmath46 of the fibre - sipm chain .",
    "figure  7 shows the result .",
    "the spatial resolution @xmath47 is plotted for different values of @xmath46 and depending on the angle @xmath48 of incidence of a particle , projected into the bending plane of the magnet .",
    "@xmath47 is the resolution along the axis perpendicular to the fibers .",
    "since the beam telescope used in the testbeam measured the coordinate @xmath49 perpendicular the direction of incidence @xmath50 , @xmath47 is calculated from the measured @xmath51 and the positioning accuracy @xmath52 as follows : @xmath53 for the photo electron yield achieved in the testbeam , a spatial resolution of @xmath54 is obtained at the mean projected angle of incidence , which is @xmath55 for the pebs geometry .",
    "the testbeam results indicate that this concept for a high - resolution scifi / sipm tracker is technical feasible .",
    "the average yield of 6 photoelectrons with a reflective foil on one fiber end and the sspm-0606exp sipm matched our requirements .",
    "sipms with a reduced pixel density and a @xmath56 higher pde are already commercially available from hamamatsu .",
    "furthermore the light output from scintillating fibers can be improved by @xmath57 using fibers without white coating as measurements with different fiber coatings conducted for the cream experiment have shown@xcite . up to now we have not engineered the optical coupling between fibers and sipm s at all .    a spatial resolution as good as @xmath30 is in principle possible , depending on the granularity of the readout , the quality of the sipm s , the qualtity of the optical coupling of the fibers to the sipm s and the type of fibers used . with the understanding and technology we have today , an average spatial resolution of @xmath58 is expected .",
