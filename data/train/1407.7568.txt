    "richard stanley has been a pioneer in modern combinatorics , and a key figure in the development of both enumerative combinatorics and algebraic combinatorics .",
    "in enumerative combinatorics two crucial building blocks are * ( a ) * the generating series for a set of combinatorial objects , and * ( b ) *  the relationship between algebraic operations on types of generating series and combinatorial operations on the set .",
    "the enumerative significance of a generating series is , of course , that the normalized coefficient of each of its monomials counts the objects in the set of combinatorial objects indexed by the monomial .",
    "stanley contributed early to these important building blocks in his paper with doubilet and rota  @xcite  part of gian - carlo rota s seminal series _",
    "`` on the foundations of combinatorial theory''_. further early work appeared in paper  @xcite .",
    "the power of algebraic combinatorics often seems to depend on the efficacy of the analogue relationship between algebra and the combinatorics , in which methods from one may assist in solving questions raised in the other .",
    "stanley has been particularly attracted by combinatorics that has made an impact in other branches of mathematics , and was himself an early developer of many of these analogue relationships .",
    "our own work has been inspired by these early developments . in an essential way",
    ", they have influenced our work in enumerative combinatorics , both together and separately , which has , in its turn , contributed to the further study of the connection between combinatorial structure and algebraic structure , and its application to other parts of mathematics and the mathematical sciences .",
    "in this article , we describe our longtime work on transitive factorizations of permutations .",
    "the themes that it illustrates include :    * the fundamental underlying combinatorial problem is very simple to state ; * the contexts in which instances of this combinatorial problem arise are diverse within mathematics and mathematical physics ; * the interplay between algebra and combinatorics is exhibited in both directions , with methods from other parts of mathematics applied to combinatorial problems , as well as combinatorial methods applied within other parts of mathematics ; * work in this area continues to be the subject of intense research activity both in algebraic combinatorics and in other parts of mathematics ; * stanley s work has made an important contribution in a number of places .",
    "we now describe the fundamental factorization problem that we consider in this article , with two variations .",
    "the following notation will be used : @xmath0 is the symmetric group acting on the symbols @xmath1 ; we write @xmath2 , or equivalently @xmath3 , to indicate that @xmath4 is a partition of @xmath5 ; the number of parts in @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is used to denote the conjugacy class of @xmath0 with natural index @xmath4 . if @xmath8 is the number of parts of @xmath4 equal to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , then @xmath11 .",
    "[ pfp ] for fixed partitions @xmath12 of @xmath5 , find the number of permutations @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 we shall call @xmath17 a _ factorization _ of @xmath18 .    [ tpfp ] for fixed partitions @xmath12 of @xmath5 , find the number of permutations @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , that satisfy equation  ( [ permfactn ] ) , and such that @xmath19 , the group generated by the factors @xmath20 , acts transitively on the underlying symbols @xmath21 .",
    "in this case we shall call @xmath17 a _ transitive factorization _ of @xmath18 .",
    "there were a number of papers in the combinatorics literature on permutation factorization problems in the 70 s by various authors .",
    "these relied on elementary methods only ; see , for example , walkup  @xcite . in his 1981 paper",
    "@xcite , stanley applied the powerful mathematical methodology of symmetric group characters to solve the problem in the case in which all factors are @xmath5-cycles ( in the conjugacy class @xmath22 ) .",
    "as part of this , he was able to prove a conjecture from  @xcite .",
    "a convenient way of describing the method of symmetric group characters is to work in the centre of the group algebra of @xmath23 .",
    "one basis of the centre is the set @xmath24 of classes , and another is the set @xmath25 of orthogonal idempotents .",
    "these bases are related by the linear relations @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the character @xmath28 of the ( ordinary ) irreducible representation of @xmath23 indexed by @xmath4 , and evaluated on the class @xmath29 .",
    "encoded in this way , the answer to the permutation factorization problem is given by @xmath30y$ ] denotes the coefficient of @xmath31 in the expansion of @xmath32 .",
    "the factor @xmath33 appears in  ( [ classsoln ] ) since each element of the class @xmath34 is created in the product with the same frequency ; the factor @xmath33 would be removed if in  ( [ permfactn ] ) we were considering permutation factorizations of a fixed and arbitrary element @xmath18 of the class @xmath34 .",
    "of course , to apply  ( [ classsoln ] ) , one simply applies  ( [ classidem ] ) , and uses the fact that @xmath35 if @xmath36 , and @xmath37 otherwise .",
    "thus , one has changed bases to one in which multiplication is `` trivial '' , before changing back to the basis of conjugacy classes . in general , the resulting expression is a sum over partitions of @xmath5 involving arbitrary characters of the symmetric group .",
    "such summations are generally regarded as intractable , but significant simplification occurs in the case considered by stanley  @xcite , where all factors are @xmath5-cycles ( so @xmath38 for @xmath15 ) . in this case",
    ", the characters have explicit evaluations , almost always equal to @xmath39 .",
    "since the group generated by any single @xmath5-cycle acts transitively on @xmath1 , the factorizations that stanley considered in that paper were in fact transitive , though this condition is not caused by any particularly `` natural '' mathematical reason .",
    "the remainder of the paper deals with applications of transitive permutation factorization in which the transitivity condition is quite natural , and involve factors in arbitrary conjugacy classes , not simply @xmath5-cycles .",
    "a _ rooted map _ is a graph embedded in a surface so that all faces are two - cells ( homeomorphic to a disc ) . in the case of orientable surfaces ,",
    "one vertex is distinguished , called the root vertex , and one edge incident with the root vertex is distinguished , called the root edge . in order to construct permutation factorizations corresponding to a rooted map in an orientable surface with @xmath5 edges ,",
    "assign labels to the two ends of the edges with the integers @xmath40 subject only to the restriction that the end of the root edge incident with the root vertex is assigned the label @xmath41 .",
    "we call the resulting object a _ decorated rooted map _ , and of course , there are @xmath42 decorated rooted maps corresponding to every rooted map with @xmath5 edges .",
    "an example with @xmath43 edges using the standard polygonal representation of the torus is given in figure  [ otblefig ] .",
    "[ mapperms ] ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , tutte  @xcite for full details ) given a decorated rooted map with @xmath5 edges , construct three permutations @xmath44 in @xmath45 as follows :    * the disjoint cycles of @xmath46 , the _ vertex permutation _",
    ", are the clockwise circular lists of end labels of edges incident with each vertex ; * the disjoint cycles of @xmath47 , the _ edge permutation _ , are the pairs of labels on the two ends of each edge ; * the disjoint cycles of @xmath48 , the _ face permutation _ , are the counterclockwise circular lists of the second label on each edge encountered when traversing the interior of the faces .    as an example of construction  [ mapperms ] ,",
    "the three permutations that we construct from the decorated rooted map given in figure  [ otblefig ] are : @xmath49    from the description in construction  [ mapperms ] , it is clear that in general , as in the above example ,    * the lengths of the cycles of @xmath46 specify the vertex - degrees of the underlying rooted map , * all cycles of @xmath47 have length @xmath50 , * the lengths of the cycles of @xmath48 specify the face - degrees of the underlying map",
    ".    moreover , by construction we have @xmath51 , and the fact that @xmath52 acts transitively on the symbols @xmath40 follows immediately from the fact that the embedded graph is connected . finally , the genus of the embedding surface can be obtained from @xmath53 by euler s formula .",
    "consequently , the enumeration of rooted maps embedded in orientable surfaces is , up to scaling , a special case of the transitive permutation factorization problem ( problem  [ tpfp ] ) , in which there are precisely two factors . when we solve this enumerative question in terms of group characters by means of  ( [ classsoln ] ) , and form the generating series",
    ", we find that symmetric functions are introduced in a natural way because the linear relations  ( [ classidem ] ) are scale equivalent to the linear relations @xmath54 between the schur functions @xmath55 and power sums @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for @xmath57 , @xmath58 partitions of @xmath59 , if @xmath60 is the number of rooted maps in orientable surfaces with @xmath5 edges , vertex degrees given by the parts of @xmath57 , and face degrees given by the parts of @xmath58 , then we obtain @xmath61 h_o\\left ( p({\\mathbf{x } } ) , p({\\mathbf{y } } ) , p({\\mathbf{z } } ) , t \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the set of all ( integer ) partitions , @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the degree @xmath66 power sum symmetric function in the indeterminates @xmath67 . full details of this was developed with visentin in @xcite , so we make only a few technical remarks here : * ( a ) * the generating series @xmath68 is actually an _ exponential _ generating series in the indeterminate @xmath69 , but for the number of _ decorated _ rooted maps , * ( b * ) the `` @xmath70 '' appears in  ( [ gseriesorient ] ) to restrict to the connected objects in the usual way for exponential generating series , * ( c * ) the effect of @xmath71 in  ( [ gseriesorient ] ) is to multiply the coefficient of @xmath72 by @xmath59 , thus adjusting the exponential monomial @xmath73 to @xmath74 ; this division by @xmath42 is the correct scaling between decorated rooted maps and rooted maps , * ( d ) * the coefficient of arbitrary monomials @xmath75 in @xmath68 also has combinatorial meaning ; it accounts for rooted _",
    "this enumerative approach to rooted maps was extended in  @xcite from orientable surfaces to all surfaces ( includes non - orientable surfaces ) .",
    "for all surfaces , the class algebra of the symmetric group  products of conjugacy classes , was replaced by the hecke algebra associated with the hyperoctahdedral group  products of double cosets of the symmetric group multiplied by the hyperoctahedral subgroup on both sides .",
    "stanley s paper with hanlon and stembridge  @xcite was an essential source , describing completely the character theory of this algebra , and the relationship with symmetric functions , in this case the zonal polynomials @xmath76 . for the generating series , again with @xmath57 , @xmath58 partitions of @xmath59 , let @xmath77 be the number of rooted maps in locally orientable surfaces with @xmath5 edges , vertex degrees given by the parts of @xmath57 , and face degrees given by the parts of @xmath58 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath78 h\\left ( p({\\mathbf{x } } ) , p({\\mathbf{y } } ) , p({\\mathbf{z } } ) , t \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "again , the coefficient of arbitrary monomials @xmath75 in @xmath82 accounts for rooted _ hypermaps_.    but there is more that we can say .",
    "we showed in  @xcite that @xmath68 and @xmath82 have a common generalization as the cases @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , of @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the jack symmetric function with parameter @xmath4 and @xmath87 is the standard inner product on the ring of symmetric functions . in this work ,",
    "our source for the necessary results on jack symmetric functions was again a paper of stanley , in this case  @xcite .",
    "following extensive computer algebra computations with the generating series @xmath88 , we conjectured the following :    [ bconjecture ] the series @xmath89 has coefficients that are _ polynomial _ in @xmath90 with _ non - negative integer coefficients_. in this polynomial , the constant term , obtained with @xmath91 ( so @xmath83 ) , accounts for rooted hypermaps embedded in orientable surfaces , and the sum of all terms , obtained with @xmath92 ( so @xmath84 ) , accounts for rooted hypermaps embedded in all surfaces .",
    "accordingly , the indeterminate @xmath90 marks a _ statistic of nonorientability _ associated with rooted hypermaps .",
    "the @xmath90-conjecture has not yet been resolved , but some progress towards determining a suitable statistic of nonorientabilty has been made , and work is ongoing .",
    "recent progress with la croix  @xcite has involved providing combinatorial interpretations , in terms of maps and hypermaps ( or of transformations of the series in terms of polynomial glueings ) , for sums of coefficients rather than for individual coefficients . despite success with these marginal sums ,",
    "a complete understanding of the @xmath90-conjecture for maps and hypermaps continues to elude us .",
    "there is a closely related @xmath90-conjecture for _ matchings _ that we conjectured in @xcite .",
    "previously , progress on the matching version has appeared in  dolega and fray  @xcite and dolega , fray and niady  @xcite .",
    "stanley s paper with hanlon and stembridge  @xcite also contained matrix integral results associated with symmetric functions . especially due to the influence of mathematical physics ,",
    "such results are important in algebraic combinatorics , and this continues to be an area of active research interest . the generating series for maps , whose",
    "symmetric function expressions have been discussed in the previous two sections , also have matrix integral forms , and we present a brief discussion of these in this section .    for @xmath93 ,",
    "let @xmath94 denote the number of rooted maps in orientable surfaces with @xmath95 vertices of degree @xmath66 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 faces , and @xmath5 edges , and let @xmath98 denote the corresponding number in all surfaces . define the generating series @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "a matrix integral , over hermitian complex matrices , was given in @xcite for @xmath101 .",
    "using a different argument , a matrix integral over real symmetric matrices was given in @xcite for @xmath102 .",
    "these integrals can be transformed by the weyl integration theorems ( the diagonalizing groups are the unitary group and the orthogonal group , respectively ; the measure may be factored into haar measure for the manifold of the groups , and an @xmath103 integral over the spectra @xmath57 ) , and with harer  @xcite we obtained a common generalization @xmath104 of the diagonalized integrals , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the vandermonde determinant . for combinatorial reasons ,",
    "the coefficients of @xmath109 are polynomials in @xmath110 ; we may formally replace @xmath110 by @xmath111 to obtain @xmath112 from @xmath113 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath4 in  ( [ rnalphaintegral ] ) specializes in the same way as the jack parameter in  ( [ jacksum ] ) or conjecture  [ bconjecture ] , but we do not have a matrix integral ( undiagonalized ) that involves the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "an immediate application in  @xcite was to obtain @xmath114 , the virtual euler characteristic of the moduli spaces of real curves of genus @xmath115 , with @xmath116 marked points and a fixed topological type of orientation reversing involution @xmath117 .",
    "harer and zagier  @xcite had earlier obtained @xmath118 , the virtual euler characteristic for the case of complex curves , using the fact that it can be obtained from a sum over rooted _",
    "monopoles _  maps with a single face . a further application in @xcite , of the common generalization  ( [ rnalphaintegral ] ) , was to determine a common generalization @xmath119 of these virtual euler characteristics , that gave the complex case when @xmath83 and the real case when @xmath84",
    "comparing this with the @xmath90-conjecture ( conjecture  [ bconjecture ] ) suggests that the coefficients of @xmath90 in the polynomial @xmath120 have a geometric interpretation in the context of the moduli spaces of curves , but this has not been resolved to date .",
    "there are applications of @xmath119 to string theory .",
    "for example , the expressions for the virtual euler characteristics for real and complex curve confirm the case @xmath121 determined by ooguri and vafa  @xcite associated with the @xmath122 and @xmath123 gauge groups .",
    "we conclude this section with the following observation . by comparing the symmetric function and matrix integral expressions for the map generating series",

    "this conjecture was subsequently proved by okounkov  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ maporient ] , we showed that the special case of the transitive factorization problem ( problem  [ tpfp ] ) with two factors has a geometric interpretation in terms of rooted maps , or embedded graphs , in orientable surfaces . in that case the genus of the embedding surface could be determined from the factors by euler s polyhedral formula . in this section",
    ", we consider a second geometric interpretation of the transitive factorization problem , in this case in terms of _ branched covers _ from algebraic geometry .",
    "consider branched covers of the sphere by an @xmath5-sheeted riemann surface of genus @xmath115 .",
    "suppose that the branch points are @xmath126 , with branching at @xmath127 specified by permutation @xmath128 , for @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "( this means that if one walks in a small neighbourhood , counterclockwise , around @xmath127 , starting at sheet @xmath97 , then one ends at sheet @xmath131 . )",
    "hurwitz  @xcite proved that , up to homeomorphism , each @xmath132 as defined above determines a unique branched cover precisely when , in the language of problem  [ tpfp ] , @xmath133 is a transitive factorization of @xmath134 .",
    "note the following points :    * the fact that the permutations form a factorization is a _ monodromy _",
    "condition on the sheets ; * the transitivity condition on the factorization means that the cover is connected ; * we say that the _ branching type _ of @xmath135 is @xmath4 , and of @xmath127 is @xmath136 , @xmath15 ; * the genus of the surface @xmath115 is obtained from the branching types of the permutations by the _ riemann - hurwitz _ formula , which gives @xmath137 * the minimum number of factors in such a transitive factorization , from  ( [ riehur ] ) , is @xmath138 which are obtained with genus @xmath139 .",
    "we call such factorizations _ minimal _ transitive factorizations ; * if branching at a branch point is a transposition then it is called _",
    "our own work on the enumeration of branched covers was initiated through richard stanley .",
    "arising from joint work with crescimanno @xcite , washington taylor ( dept .",
    "of physics , mit ) had asked stanley about a particular transitive factorization problem for permutations , that turned out to be a special case of _ hurwitz numbers _ in genus @xmath39 .",
    "stanley suggested he should contact me ( dmj ) .",
    "taylor s e - mail languished unanswered for three months on an old main frame computer at waterloo .",
    "it was only through stanley s well - known and encyclopdic grasp of progress on active questions that i became aware of the oversight , after he e - mailed asking about progress .",
    "the hurwitz number @xmath140 is the number of topologically distinct branched covers in genus @xmath115 , in which branching is of type @xmath4 at one specified branch point , and branching is simple at @xmath141 remaining branch points . _",
    "topologically distinct _",
    "means that we divide the number of branched covers by @xmath142 , for geometric reasons .",
    "thus @xmath140 equals @xmath143 times the number of transitive factorizations of an element of @xmath34 into @xmath141 transpositions , where :    * from  ( [ riehur ] ) , the number of transpositions is given by @xmath144 ; * the group generated by the @xmath145 transpositions acts transitively on @xmath21 .",
    "equivalently , the multigraph with vertex - set @xmath21 , and @xmath141 edges , one edge @xmath146 for each transposition @xmath147 , is connected .    in this language",
    ", taylor was asking about the number of transitive factorizations of the identity permutation into @xmath148 transpositions .",
    "these are minimal transitive factorizations , with genus @xmath139 , and hence are given by the hurwitz number @xmath149 .",
    "in our first attempts to solve taylor s problem , we applied group characters , to obtain a generating series in the form of a logarithm of a schur function summation , analogous to the map generating series given in  ( [ gseriesorient ] ) .",
    "we were not able to obtain an explicit formula for taylor s problem from this symmetric function form of the generating series , so we moved on to the following more indirect analysis : form the generating series @xmath150 in the indeterminates @xmath151 , and suppose that the last transposition in the factorization is @xmath147 . then",
    "when we multiply a permutation by @xmath147 , there are two possibilities :    * @xmath152 and @xmath90 occur on _ different _ cycles of lengths @xmath9 and @xmath97 , and the cycles are _ joined _ to form a single cycle of length @xmath153 ; * @xmath152 and @xmath90 occur on the _ same _ cycle , of length @xmath153 , and this cycle is _ cut _ into a cycle of length @xmath9 and a cycle of length @xmath97 .",
    "this analysis ( which we call a join - cut analysis ) leads immediately to the formal partial differential equation @xmath154 which we call the _ join - cut equation _ for the series @xmath155 . together with the initial condition @xmath156h^0=0 $ ]",
    ", this uniquely determines @xmath155 .",
    "it turns out that working with equation  ( [ jcutpde ] ) is greatly simplified by changing variables from @xmath157 to @xmath116 by means of the functional equation @xmath158 this change of variables is pefectly natural within algebraic combinatorics , and is quite tractable by means of lagrange s implicit function theorem .",
    "for example , we can express the series @xmath155 in terms of @xmath116 in the simple form @xmath159 and it follows immediately from lagrange s theorem that the hurwitz number for genus @xmath39 has the explicit form @xmath160 where @xmath2 and @xmath161 ( see @xcite for full details ) . in this notation ,",
    "dnes  @xcite and crescimanno and taylor  @xcite had previously obtained the results for @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "we were unaware when writing the paper that this explicit form for all @xmath4 had been obtained much earlier by hurwitz  @xcite .",
    "the join - cut analysis can be extended to hurwitz numbers in arbitrary genus . again",
    "the change of variables in  ( [ szeqn ] ) helps to simplify , and in  @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) we were led to conjecture the existence of a polynomial @xmath164 , for each @xmath165 and @xmath166 , such that for all partitions @xmath167 with @xmath168 parts , @xmath169 for example , from  ( [ h0alpha ] ) , since @xmath2 , we have @xmath170",
    "hurwitz numbers have been the subject of much research interest over the last couple of decades , with a variety of mathematical areas making substantial contributions , including mathematical physics , algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics .",
    "for example , soon after we conjectured the existence of the polynomial @xmath171 in  ( [ hgalpha ] ) , ekedahl , lando , shapiro and vainshtein @xcite proved it by constructing an explicit expression for the polynomial as a _",

    "earlier , and perhaps most notably , witten  @xcite had initiated much of this work by his conjecture that a transform of the generating series for hurwitz numbers is a @xmath117-function for the kdv hierarchy from integrable systems .",
    "witten s motivation for the conjecture was that two different models of two - dimensional quantum gravity have the same partition function .",
    "for one of these models , the partition function can be described in terms of intersection numbers on moduli space , but also in terms of hurwitz numbers .",
    "conjecture @xcite was proved soon after by kontsevich @xcite , and a number of proofs have appeared since , for example kazarian and lando @xcite .    a variant of hurwitz numbers called _",
    "double _ hurwitz numbers have also been the subject of recent research interest .",
    "they were introduced by okounkov @xcite , motivated by a conjecture of pandharipande @xcite in gromow - witten theory .",
    "okounkov showed that a particular generating series for double hurwitz numbers is a @xmath117-function for the toda lattice hierarchy from integrable systems .",
    "the double hurwitz number @xmath180 is the number of topologically distinct branched covers in genus @xmath115 , where branching is of type @xmath4 at one specified branch point , type @xmath181 at another specified branch point , and branching is simple at @xmath141 remaining branch points .",
    "thus @xmath180 equals @xmath182 ( this factor is chosen for geometric reasons ) times the number of transitive factorizations of an element of @xmath34 into an element of @xmath183 together with @xmath141 transpositions , where :      in joint work with vakil @xcite , we used both group characters and a join - cut analysis to obtain various results for double hurwitz numbers .",
    "one of these was the following conjectured elsv - type formula for double hurwitz numbers where one of the partitions has a single part :      a second result we obtained for double hurwitz numbers , reminiscent of the polynomiality result given in  ( [ hgalpha ] ) for hurwitz numbers , was a _",
