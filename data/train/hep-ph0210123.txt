    "<S> the origin of highest energy cosmic rays is yet unknown . </S>",
    "<S> an appealing possibility is the so - called z - burst scenario , in which a large fraction of these cosmic rays are decay products of z bosons produced in the scattering of ultrahigh energy neutrinos on cosmological relic neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the observed and predicted spectra constrains the mass of the heaviest neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> the required neutrino mass is fairly robust against variations of the presently unknown quantities , such as the amount of relic neutrino clustering , the universal photon radio background and the extragalactic magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> considering different possibilities for the ordinary cosmic rays the required neutrino masses are determined . in the most plausible case that the ordinary cosmic rays are of extragalactic origin and the universal radio background is strong enough to suppress high energy photons , the required neutrino mass is @xmath0  ev  @xmath1  ev  . the required ultrahigh energy neutrino flux should be detected in the near future by experiments such as amanda , rice or the pierre auger observatory .     </S>"
