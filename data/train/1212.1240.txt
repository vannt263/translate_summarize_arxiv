    "recent progress in the engineering and fabrication of well - defined artificial systems - quantum dots ( qds ) , leads to the possibility of ultra small electronic devices formation with a relatively high control of system parameters ( size , shape and energy spectrum ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the qds potential industrial applications , these nanoscale objects provide an ideal test ground for the study of basic physics including , many - body interaction effects , electron transport and time - dependent effects . moreover ,",
    "qds integration in a little quantum circuits deals with careful analysis of non - equilibrium charge distribution , relaxation processes and non - stationary effects .",
    "these processes influence strongly on the electron transport through the system of qds @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "electron transport in such systems is governed not only by the coulomb interaction between localized electrons @xcite,@xcite,@xcite but also by the electron - phonon interaction @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical works devoted to the problem of electron transport through the coupled qds in the presence of electron - phonon interaction deal with the tunneling current and current - current correlations ( shot noise ) investigations @xcite,@xcite . only a few attempts have been made to analyze phonon assisted localized charge relaxation @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it was found theoretically that lateral confinement influence on the single - electron relaxation rates in parabolic qds @xcite .",
    "author considered the deformation potential coupling between electrons and longitudinal acoustic phonons , while neglecting piezoelectric coupling on the grounds of it s weaker contribution in two dimensional structures . on the other hand further theoretical and experimental works suggested that electron - acoustic phonon scattering due to the piezoelectric field interaction is relevant for momentum and spin relaxation processes @xcite,@xcite and may even provide charge decoherence in laterally coupled qds @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite authors analyzed phonon induced single electron relaxation rates in the models of weakly confined single and vertically coupled qds taking into account both mentioned above mechanisms .",
    "the regimes where each coupling mechanism prevails were found .    in this paper",
    "we use the keldysh diagram technique @xcite to analyze charge relaxation in a double qds due to the coupling with the continuous spectrum states in the presence of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "tunneling to the reservoir is possible only from one of the dots .",
    "we have found that electron - phonon interaction results in the increasing of localized charge relaxation rate and also leads to the formation of well resolved oscillations .",
    "in the present paper we consider a system of coupled qds with the single particle levels @xmath0 and @xmath1 connected with the continuous spectrum states . at the initial time two electrons with opposite spins are localized in the first qd on the energy level @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the second qd with the energy level @xmath1 is connected with the reservoir ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "relaxation of the localized charge is governed by the hamiltonian :    @xmath4    the hamiltonian @xmath5 of interacting qds    @xmath6    contains the spin - degenerate levels @xmath7 ( indexes @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the first and to the second qd ) and electron - phonon interaction .",

    "the interaction between the dots is described by the tunneling transfer amplitude @xmath16 which is considered to be independent of momentum and spin .",
    "the coupling between the second dot and the continuous spectrum states is described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the tunneling amplitude , which we assume to be independent on momentum and spin . by considering a constant density of states in the reservoir @xmath19 , the tunnel rate @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the continuous spectrum states are modeled by the hamiltonian :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 creates / annihilates an electron with spin @xmath24 and momentum @xmath25 in the lead .",
    "we shall use keldysh diagram technique to describe charge density relaxation processes in the considered system .",
    "time evolution of the electron density in the qd is determined by the keldysh green function @xmath26 which is connected with the localized state filling numbers in the following way :    @xmath27    integro - differential equations for green function @xmath28 without electron - phonon interaction has the form :    @xmath29    in the case when initial charge is localized in the first qd and the second dot is empty , the third term in the eq.([g_0 ] ) can be neglected .",

    "it is clearly evident that electron - phonon interaction leads to the increasing of localized charge relaxation rate .",
    "the growth of the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath15 for a given set of system parameters results in the increasing of filling numbers relaxation rate . with the increasing of the initial detuning the influence of electron - phonon interaction on the charge time evolution",

    "see grey and black - dashed lines on the fig.[fig.1]b ) and in the absence of electron - phonon interaction ( see black line on the fig.[fig.1]b ) . the typical time scale which determines the localized charge relaxation is close to the value @xmath94 . for the larger values of detuning",
    "than the critical one , localized charge time evolution reveals two typical time intervals with different values of the relaxation rates ( see fig.[fig.1]a ) .",
    "the first time interval relaxation rate exceeds the relaxation rate of the second time interval both in the presence and in the absence of electron - phonon coupling . without electron - phonon interaction",
    "the first time interval reveals charge relaxation with the typical rate @xmath95 .",
    "the second time interval demonstrates charge time evolution with relaxation rate close to @xmath96 .",
    "when electron phonon - coupling is involved , the filling numbers time evolution in the first time interval has the value @xmath97 and in the second time interval - @xmath98 .",
    "consequently , electron - phonon interaction results in the two times increasing of localized charge relaxation rate .",
    "let us now focus on the charge relaxation processes in the case of negative initial detuning between energy levels in the qds ( @xmath99 ) ( see fig.[fig.2 ] ) .",
    "one can clearly see that in the case of negative detuning electron - phonon interaction also results in the increasing of localized charge relaxation rate , but this effect is less pronounced .",
    "charge time evolution changes slightly in comparison with the situation when positive detuning occurs . in the case of negative detuning always exist several time intervals with different values of the relaxation rates ( see fig.[fig.2 ] ) .",
    "for the small value of initial detuning ( see fig.[fig.2]b ) relaxation rates on the both time intervals are very close to each other and to the value @xmath95 both in the presence and in the absence of electron - phonon interaction . for the larger value of initial detuning in the case",
    "when electron - phonon coupling is absent the first time interval reveals charge relaxation with the typical rate @xmath95 and the second time interval corresponds to the relaxation rate @xmath100 .",
    "when electron - phonon coupling is considered , relaxation rates increase slightly and they are continue being very close o the values @xmath95 and @xmath100 for the first and second time intervals correspondingly .",
    "the most interesting effect in this energy levels configuration is the formation of oscillations in the filling numbers time evolution , caused by the emission and adsorption of phonons by the energy levels when detuning is close to the phonon frequency .",
    "oscillations are well pronounced for the large value of initial detuning ( see fig.[fig.2]a and the inset ) . for a given set of system parameters the oscillations amplitude",
    "is determined by the value of the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath15 ( see fig.[fig.2 ] ) .",
    "the presence of oscillations may even lead to the decreasing of filling numbers relaxation rate in comparison with the case when electron - phonon interaction is absent ( see black - dashed and black lines on the fig.[fig.2]a ) for a given set of system parameters in the particular time intervals .",
    "we investigated filling numbers time evolution in the system of two interacting qds weakly coupled to the reservoir in the presence of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "it was shown that electron - phonon interaction results in the increasing of localized charge relaxation rate .",
    "the value of extantion is determined by the system parameters such as energy levels detuning , optical phonon frequency and the ratio between electron - phonon coupling constant and tunneling transfer amplitudes .",
    "we revealed that in the case of positive initial detuning between energy levels in the dots the influence of electron - phonon interaction is mostly pronounced and the relaxation rate increases with the growth of the initial detuning value .",
    "we found that when negative initial detuning is considered , the influence of electron - phonon interaction leads to the formation of oscillations in the filling numbers time evolution .",
    "these oscillations are the result of phonons emission and adsorption between the energy levels .",
