    "as will be demonstrated in section [ se : motivation ] , the study of @xmath3 is motivated by its appeareance in a variety of situations .",

    "furthermore , a fundamental result due to bjrner and wachs @xcite asserts that ( the order complex of ) every ( open ) interval in @xmath19 is a pl sphere .",
    "recent results on @xmath21 produce a similar picture .",

    "* describe the topology of the intervals of @xmath14 .",
    "we do not know the complete solution to either of the problems .",
    "our main results on @xmath14 are these partial answers :    * in theorem [ th : graded ] it is shown that if @xmath5 never is of odd order for @xmath4 unless @xmath24 is a fixed point of @xmath1 , then @xmath14 is graded with rank function @xmath7 . for example",
