    "despite recent observational and theoretical progress , the initial conditions of star formation and the first phases of protostellar collapse remain poorly known .",
    "it is reasonably well established that low - mass stars form from the collapse of centrally - condensed cloud cores initially supported against gravity by a combination of thermal , magnetic , and turbulent pressures ( e.g. shu et al .",
    "1987 , 1993 for reviews ) . however , the critical conditions beyond which a cloud core becomes unstable and starts to collapse are uncertain and still a matter of debate ( e.g. shu 1977 , mouschovias 1991 , boss 1995 , whitworth et al .",
    "in particular , they depend on yet unmeasured factors such as the strengths of the static and fluctuating components of the magnetic field .",
    "+ once fast cloud collapse sets in , the main _ theoretical _ features of the dynamical evolution that follows have been known since the pioneering work of larson ( 1969 ) . during a probably brief first phase ,",
    "the released gravitational energy is freely radiated away and the cloud stays isothermal . this initial collapse phase , which tends to produce a strong central concentration of matter , ends with the formation of an opaque , hydrostatic stellar object ( cf .",
    "larson 1969 ; boss & yorke 1995 ) . this time is often denoted @xmath5 and referred to as ( stellar ) ` core formation ' in the literature ( e.g. hunter 1977 ) .",
    "when the stellar core has fully formed , one enters the _ accretion phase _ during which the central protostar builds up its mass ( @xmath6 ) from a surrounding infalling envelope ( of mass @xmath7 ) while progressively warming up .",
    "the infalling gas is arrested and thermalized in an accretion shock at the surface of the stellar core , generating an infall luminosity l@xmath8 . in the ` standard '",
    "theory of shu et al .",
    "( 1993 ) which uses singular isothermal spheres as initial conditions , the accretion rate @xmath9 is constant and equal to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the effective sound speed . the singular isothermal sphere , which has @xmath12 , is a physically meaningful starting point for the ` self - initiated ' collapse of an isolated cloud core because it represents the ( unstable ) limit of infinite central concentration in equilibrium models for self - gravitating isothermal spheres ( e.g. shu 1977  hereafter shu77 ) .",
    "furthermore , lizano & shu ( 1989 ) have shown that magnetically - supported cloud cores undergoing ambipolar diffusion evolve naturally toward a singular configuration reminiscent of a singular isothermal sphere ( see also ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "however , it is likely that actual cloud cores become unstable and start to collapse before reaching the asymptotic singular state , especially when they are perturbed by an external agent such as a shock wave ( e.g. boss 1995 , whitworth et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this case",
    ", the initial conditions will be effectively non - singular , and @xmath9 is expected to be time - dependent ( e.g. zinnecker & tscharnuter 1984 , henriksen 1994 , foster & chevalier 1993 , mclaughlin & pudritz 1997 ) .",
    "it is this possibility that we explore further and compare with relevant observations in the present paper .",
    "+ an unsettled related issue concerns the manner in which the central hydrostatic stellar core develops . while in some models",
    "core formation occurs in a dynamical , _ supersonic _ fashion ( e.g. larson 1969 , foster & chevalier 1993 , present paper ) , this formation is achieved by slow , _ subsonic _ evolution of the gas in the scenario advocated by shu and co - workers ( see also ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "an important observational consequence is that while the dynamical models predict the existence of ` isothermal protostars ' ( in the sense of the initial collapse phase outlined above ) , these _ do not exist _ in the standard shu theory .",
    "as we will see , in practice both situations probably occur in nature .",
    "observationally , one distinguishes various empirical stages in the evolution of young stellar objects ( ysos ) from cloud core to ( low - mass ) main sequence star ( e.g. lada 1987 , andr 1994 ) .",
    "the youngest observed ysos are the class  0 sources identified by andr , ward - thompson , & barsony ( 1993  hereafter awb93 ) , which are characterized by very strong emission in the submillimeter continuum , virtually no emission below @xmath13 m , and powerful jet - like outflows .",
    "their very high ratio of submillimeter to bolometric luminosity suggests they have @xmath14 .",
    "thus , class  0 ysos are excellent candidates for being very young protostars ( estimated age @xmath15  yr ) in which the hydrostatic core has formed but not yet accreted the bulk of its final mass ( awb93 ) .",
    "the next , still deeply embedded , yso stage corresponds to the class  i sources of lada ( 1987 ) , which are detected in the near - infrared ( @xmath16 m ) and have only moderate submillimeter continuum emission ( andr & montmerle 1994 ; hereafter am94 ) .",
    "they are interpreted as more evolved protostars ( typical age @xmath17 10@xmath18  yr ) surrounded by both a disk and a residual circumstellar envelope of substellar mass ( @xmath17 0.1 - 0.3  @xmath19 at most in @xmath4 ophiuchi ; cf .",
    "am94 ) . finally , the most evolved ( class  ii and class  iii ) yso stages correspond to pre - main sequence stars ( e.g. , t  tauri stars ) surrounded by a circumstellar disk ( optically thick and optically thin at @xmath20 m , respectively ) , but lacking a dense circumstellar envelope .",
    "+ many examples of pre - collapse , pre - stellar cloud cores are known .",
    "in particular , myers and co - workers have studied a large number of ammonia dense cores without @xmath21 sources ( e.g. benson & myers 1989 ) which are traditionally associated with ( future ) sites of _ isolated _ low - mass star formation ( see myers 1994 for a recent review ) .",
    "these starless dense cores , which are gravitationally bound and close to virial equilibrium , are believed to be magnetically supported and to progressively evolve towards higher degrees of central concentration through ambipolar diffusion ( e.g. mouschovias 1991 ) . + more compact starless condensations have been identified in regions of _ multiple _ star formation such as the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud ( e.g. loren , wootten , & wilking 1990 , mezger et al .",
    "1992b , awb93 ) . in these regions ,",
    "the weakness of the static magnetic field ( troland et al .",
    "1996 ) and the complexity of its geometry ( goodman & heiles 1994 and references therein ) suggest that gravitational forces overpower magnetic ones and that an external trigger rather than ambipolar diffusion is responsible for cloud fragmentation and core formation ( e.g. loren & wootten 1986 ) .    in the present paper , we bring together two independent sets of observational results recently obtained on the density structure of pre - stellar dense cores ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) and on the evolution of protostellar outflows ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) , and interpret them by means of a simple analytical theory ( sect .  3.3 ) which sheds light on the accretion histories found in the numerical work of foster & chevalier ( 1993  hereafter fc93 ) .",
    "we compare our theoretical predictions with observations in sect .",
    "4 and we conclude in sect .  5 .",
    "recent submillimetre dust continuum mapping shows that the radial density profiles of pre - stellar cores are relatively steep towards their edges ( i.e. , sometimes steeper than @xmath0 ) but _ flatten out _ near their centres , becoming less steep than @xmath22 ( ward - thompson et al . 1994  hereafter wsha ; andr , ward - thompson , & motte 1996  hereafter awm96 ; ward - thompson et al .",
    "1997 ) . a representative , well - documented example of an isolated pre - stellar core is provided by l1689b , which is located in the @xmath4  ophiuchi complex but outside the main cloud . in this case",
    ", the radial density profile approaches @xmath0 between @xmath23  au and @xmath24  au , and is as flat as @xmath25 or @xmath26 ( depending on the deprojection hypothesis ) at radii less than @xmath23  au ( awm96 ) .",
    "the mass and density of the relatively flat central region are estimated to be @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "+ by contrast , _ protostellar _ envelopes are always found to be strongly centrally peaked and do _ not _ exhibit the inner flattening seen in _ pre - stellar _ cores . in particular , isolated protostellar envelopes have estimated radial density profiles which range from @xmath30 to @xmath0 over more than 0.1  pc in radius ( e.g. , ladd et al . 1991 ; motte et al .",
    "this difference of structure between the pre - collapse stage and the protostellar stage is illustrated in fig .  1 which compares the radial intensity profiles of the pre - stellar core l1689b and the candidate class  0 object l1527 .",
    "+ we also note that recent large - scale , high - angular resolution imaging of the @xmath4 ophiuchi cloud with the mid - infrared camera isocam on board the iso satellite ( abergel et al . 1996 ) suggests dense cores in clusters are often characterized by very sharp edges ( i.e. , steeper than @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) , possibly produced by external pressure .",
    "( the @xmath4  oph dense cores are seen as deep absorption structures by isocam . )",
    "these results on the structure of dense cores set constraints on the initial conditions for gravitational collapse .",
    "the starless cores detected in the submillimeter continuum are thought to be descendants of cores without detectable submillimeter emission ( which have lower densities ) and precursors of cores with embedded low - mass protostars . based on the numbers of sources observed in the three groups of cores ,",
    "the lifetime of starless cores with submillimeter emission was estimated to be @xmath33  yr by wsha .",
    "so far a dozen pre - stellar cores have been studied in detail in the submillimeter , and an inner flattening of the radial density profile has been found for _ all _ of them .",
    "therefore , the statistics indicate that the transition from flat to steep inner density profile occurs on a timescale shorter than @xmath34  yr , consistent with a phase of fast , possibly supersonic collapse ( ward - thompson et al . 1997 ) . + ambipolar diffusion models of core formation do predict that the time spent from the critical to the singular state is relatively short ( typically @xmath35  yr in the models of mouschovias and co - workers ) .",
    "thus , in itself , the fact that most starless cores are observed in the more long - lived state when the central density profile is fairly flat does not contradict these models .",
    "however , close comparison with the parameter study presented by basu & mouschovias ( 1995 ) shows that the above timescale estimates agree roughly with the magnetically - supported core models _ only if _ the initial cloud is highly subcritical ( ward - thompson et al . 1997 ) , which implies rather high values of the ( static ) core magnetic field ( @xmath36 g in the case of l1689b ",
    "see awm96 ) .",
    "upper limits to the field in cloud cores obtained through zeeman observations are typically lower than that ( e.g. crutcher et al .",
    "1996 , troland et al .",
    "1996 ) , which suggests the observed dense cores can not all be supported by a static magnetic field and can not all have formed by ambipolar diffusion alone .",
    "the same conclusion is independently supported by a statistical analysis of the observed core shapes which indicates that the overall morphology is prolate for most cores ( myers et al .",
    "1991 ; ryden 1996 ) .",
    "this tends to go against ambipolar diffusion models which produce oblate cores , flattened in the direction of the mean magnetic field .",
    "+ therefore , although a more complete study of the structure of starless cores would be desirable , we take the present observational evidence to suggest that , in some cases at least , the initial conditions for rapid protostellar collapse are characterized by a centrally flattened density profile and differ significantly from a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "class  0 protostars tend to drive highly collimated or `` jet  like '' co molecular outflows ( see review by bachiller 1996 ) .",
    "the mechanical luminosities of these outflows are often of the same order as the bolometric luminosities of the central sources ( e.g. , awb93 ) . in contrast",
    ", while there is growing evidence that some outflow activity exists throughout the embedded phase , the co outflows from class  i sources tend to be poorly collimated and much less powerful than those from class  0 sources .    in an effort to quantify this evolution of molecular outflows during the protostellar phase , bontemps et al .",
    "( 1996  batc ) have recently obtained and analyzed a homogeneous set of co(21 ) data around a large sample of low - luminosity ( @xmath37 ) , nearby ( @xmath38  pc ) embedded ysos , including 36 class  i sources and 9 class  0 sources .",
    "the results show that essentially _ all _ embedded ysos have some degree of outflow activity , suggesting the outflow phase and the infall / accretion phase coincide .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that accretion can not proceed without ejection and that outflows are directly powered by accretion ( e.g. , ferreira & pelletier 1995 ) .",
    "+ in addition , class  0 objects are found to lie an order of magnitude above the well - known correlation between outflow momentum flux and bolometric luminosity holding for class  i sources .",
    "this confirms that class  0 objects differ qualitatively from class  i sources , independently of inclination effects .",
    "on the other hand , as can be seen in fig .  2 ,",
    "outflow momentum flux is roughly proportional to circumstellar envelope mass in the _ entire _ batc sample ( i.e. , including both class  i and class  0 sources ) .",
    "bontemps et al .",
    "argue that this new correlation is independent of the @xmath39@xmath40 correlation and most likely results from a progressive decrease of outflow power with time during the accretion phase .    since many theoretical models of bipolar outflows ( e.g. shu et al .",
    "1994 , ferreira & pelletier 1995 , fiege & henriksen 1996a , b ) predict a direct proportionality between accretion and ejection , batc further suggest that the observed decline in outflow power reflects a corresponding decrease in the mass accretion / infall rate : in this view , @xmath41 would decline from @xmath42 for the youngest class  0 protostars to @xmath43 for the most evolved class  i sources and most active t tauri stars .",
    "we propose that the decrease of accretion rate seen by batc during the protostellar phase ( see sect .  2.2 above )",
    "is a direct consequence of the non - singular initial conditions indicated by the pre - stellar core observations summarized in sect .  2.1 .",
    "our fundamental thesis in this article is that supersonic core formation and a subsequent core accretion flow may be adequately described as a zero pressure flow that evolves from a more general density profile than the @xmath44 profile at a pre - core formation epoch ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we use analytical methods to elucidate the physical origin of a sharp decrease of @xmath41 during the early accretion phase ( i.e. , just after the completion of stellar core formation ) .",
    "we show that the key to such a decrease is the existence of a transition between a flat inner region and an outer inverse square ` envelope ' in the initial density profile : the inner region collapses first to form a hydrostatic stellar core , and the remaining cloud material then accretes supersonically onto a non - zero point mass .      here , we assemble some relevant non - linear studies of isothermal protostellar collapse in spherical geometry .",
    "the isothermality seems justified physically at early ( e.g. , pre - stellar ) stages ( note this does _ not _ imply the dynamical importance of pressure ) , but the assumption of spherical symmetry implies the neglect of rotation , magnetic fields and dynamical turbulence .    mathematically , the paper by whitworth & summers ( 1985  ws85 ) concludes the series of original studies on isothermal , self - similar accretion flows by larson ( 1969 ) , penston ( 1969 ) , shu77 and hunter ( 1977 ) .",
    "however physically the debate continues , based essentially on the failure of either the larson - penston solution or the shu solution to describe the accretion rate as found in numerical simulations ( e.g. hunter 1977 , fc93 ) after the core - formation epoch .",
    "the shu solution describes the asymptotic behaviour satisfactorily , while the larson - penston solution seems more relevant near core formation although it is not perfectly so .    the major contribution of ws85 was to show that a parametrically stable infinity of ` acceptable ' similarity solutions exist rather than merely the previously known larson - penston ( l / p ) infall and the shu ( s ) implosion behind an outward going expansion wave . `",
    "acceptable ' in this context implies that the solutions have reasonable initial conditions inside an inward going compression wave in general ( that may be initiated by an external disturbance ) and describe supersonic infall after the passage of this wave .",
    "true free - fall accretion is established only after this wave has reached the centre of the system at @xmath46 .",
    "it develops behind the rebounding expansion wave .",
    "ws85 classified all possible isothermal similarity solutions in a bounded two - dimensional space .",
    "briefly , this continuum of solutions spans a wide range from ` gravity dominated ' solutions ( corresponding to the ` band  0/band  1 ' of ws85 ) to ` sound - wave ' dominated solutions ( corresponding to high ` band ' numbers in ws85 ) . the sound - wave ( or pressure )",
    "dominated solutions are those usually studied , which depend on the classical similarity variable @xmath47 ( e.g. , shu77 ) .",
    "the s solution is itself a limiting sound - wave dominated case ( ` band @xmath48 ' in ws85 ) that develops from an initial high density singular isothermal equilibrium .",
    "one might think that the gravity dominated solutions should be determined in general by the form of the density or mass profile at some epoch in the region of supersonic flow , rather than by the isothermality as in the above family .",
    "we propose a more general type of similarity ( see appendix a and below ) that arises from a given density profile in a region of supersonic flow .",
    "this idea was also hinted at in hunter ( 1977 ) in the course of his explanation of the absence of shocks in the supersonic region prior to the arrival of the compression wave at @xmath49 .",
    "hunter observes that gravity provides a non - propagating local acceleration by ` action at a distance ' .",
    "formally , the flow ceases to be hyperbolic in its causal structure , becoming elliptic instead .",
    "such a dynamical change in self - similar symmetry was considered by henriksen ( 1994  hereafter h94 ) to argue , on the basis of pressure - free , analytical calculations that non - constant accretion rates might be expected .",
    "we shall exploit this idea in the present paper after an assessment of the pressure dominated self - similar solutions .",
    "it is difficult to isolate precisely the epoch at which the change in self - similarity type occurs .",
    "we know from the simulations by hunter ( 1977 ) and recently by fc93 that classical self - similarity arises in the course of the collapse .",
    "the flow is generally found to agree best with the l / p type solution , but the agreement is not perfect , since the accretion rate found by these numerical studies is _ not _ the constant value to be expected if the self - similar solutions persist at the supersonic core formation epoch ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "in fact the accretion rate passes through a peak and then settles only gradually ( if the cloud is sufficiently large ) to the shu value ( see fig .",
    "3 of fc93 ) .",
    "the nature of this transitory peak was left somewhat unclear by fc93 due to their problems of numerical resolution at @xmath46 , but we believe its nature to be vital to the understanding of the outflow observations summarized in sect .  2.2 .",
    "we neglect both magnetic field and rotation in our discussion .",
    "mouschovias and co - workers ( mouschovias 1995 and references therein ) have demonstrated that a magnetically - supported , subcritical cloud evolves naturally to a centrally peaked , flattened density profile during a quasi - static phase of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this mechanism can successfully account for the formation and structure of some isolated pre - stellar cores .",
    "the quasi - static phase ends with the formation of a magnetically supercritical core that collapses in a dynamical but magnetically - controlled fashion , while the bulk of the cloud remains magnetically supported . in mouschovias models ,",
    "the ` dynamical ' contraction of the supercritical core is almost always subsonic and evolves only gradually towards free fall , which is not attained up to densities as large as @xmath50@xmath51  @xmath52 ( see basu & mouschovias 1995 and fig .",
    "2d of ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a rather gentle process of hydrostatic stellar core formation taking significantly longer than a free - fall time , i.e. , typically on the order of @xmath53  yr in published models from the time the parent pre - stellar core becomes magnetically supercritical at a central density @xmath34  @xmath52 .",
    "+ however , as pointed out in sect .  1 and sect .  2.1 ,",
    "some cloud cores are apparently not magnetically supported and appear to evolve faster than predicted by ambipolar diffusion models .",
    "furthermore , even in the case of initial magnetic support , superalfvnic implosion of cloud fragments is possible , for instance induced by a shock ( e.g. mouschovias 1989 , tomisaka , ikeuchi , & nakamura 1988 , tomisaka 1996 ) .",
    "this may well be a dominant process in regions of multiple star formation .",
    "thus , we believe the collapse can become vigorous and supersonic ( superalfvnic as the case may be ) relatively early on , at least in a small central mass ( see the next section ) .",
    "this is the hypothesis we will make in the remainder of the paper .",
    "rotation and magnetic fields are thought to be essential to the launching of the bipolar outflows that are invariably found to be associated with protostars ( e.g. knigl & ruden 1993 , henriksen & valls - gabaud 1994 ) .",
    "this argues in favour of their importance , at least when the outer parts of the initial cloud core fall in .",
    "it is likely that they are also important to the formation and evolution of the flattened inner parts .",
    "thus we can not expect to include the whole picture self - consistently in our subsequent arguments which ignore magnetic fields . however if gravity is the main player in the core after a ` point of no return '",
    "is passed , then our present approach remains crudely justified , if incomplete .",
    "as discussed by henriksen ( 1989  h89 ) , spherically symmetric , isothermal , self - similar collapse can be very conveniently treated when one uses a lagrangian formalism .",
    "this is recalled briefly in appendix  a for the simplest cases . here , we merely want to show that such a formalism provides continuity with the supersonic treatment to be found in sect .",
    "the advantage of the lagrangian formulation is that self - similar solutions are fully described by the generalized ` friedmann , lematre , robertson - walker ' ( flrw ) differential equation ( eq .  a2 in the limit of eqs .",
    "a4 and a5 ) :    @xmath54 which expresses the conservation of energy . in this equation",
    ", @xmath55 is the self - similar variable , where @xmath56 is the mass distribution ( i.e. , the mass contained within the sphere of radius @xmath57 as a function of @xmath57 ) at some reference epoch @xmath58 ( the reason for this time offset will become apparent later ) .",
    "the function @xmath59 gives the normalized position at time @xmath60 of the shell that was initially ( @xmath61 ) at @xmath57 .",
    "finally , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the density profile at @xmath66 , and @xmath67 or 0 is the normalized total energy ( @xmath68 being the specific total energy of the shell initially at @xmath57 ) . the solutions describing a collapse from rest have @xmath69 , and those with zero total energy have @xmath70 ( we omit other cases for simplicity ) .",
    "the present formulation is unique in that it allows for a transition to a purely self - gravitating flow wherein the pressure is negligible ( formally @xmath71 ) _ before _ the ingoing compression wave establishes the @xmath44 ` attractor ' at @xmath46 [ blottiau , bouquet , & chize ( 1988 ) were the first to use this terminology ] . in order",
    "that @xmath72 at @xmath45 in an isothermal flow , it is clear that @xmath73 must tend to a large value as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the lagrangian radius of this core or nuclear region",
    ". this can happen _ if a sufficiently dense mass with a flattened density profile forms at the centre of the system at @xmath45_. this region should eventually collapse nearly homologously to form a central point mass so long as the inflow is supersonic ( or super fast - alfvnic as the case may be ) and pressure support is negligible .",
    "assuming that some fraction of the core does collapse in the free - fall time @xmath76 , we begin our zero pressure calculations at the onset of this rapid collapse .",
    "we define this starting point as being @xmath77 , for consistency with the standard pressure wave connected solutions .",
    "( with this definition , stellar core formation is complete at @xmath46 , which also marks the beginning of the accretion phase . )",
    "when the parameter @xmath72 , one has made the transition of course from an hyperbolic system to an elliptic one . in other words , there is a wave - mitigated causality when pressure is important , and action at a distance ( in newtonian gravity ) in the zero pressure limit ( see also hunter 1977 ) .",
    "this is discussed briefly in appendix a.      the density profiles observed in pre - stellar clouds ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) are not as centrally flat as are some of the self - similar solutions of ws85 , nor indeed of the magneto - static cores of basu & mouschovias ( 1995 ) .",
    "this is not very surprising since a flat profile indicates a relatively low pressure gradient so that the hydrostatic equilibrium required for long lived clouds is not possible . in this state",
    "the cloud is in fact approaching the super - critical state .",
    "the real question then is whether the collapse proceeds in general by some part of the material passing through a phase of nearly zero pressure gradient and collapsing homologously , as the band  0 sound wave dominated self - similar solutions suggest ( see figs . 5 , 6 , 7 of ws85 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the numerical calculations by fc93 that begin from non self - similar conditions show a velocity distribution in the critical bonnor - ebert sphere at early times that would tend to _ flatten _ the density profile ( see e.g. the discussion in the second paragraph of their sect .",
    "2.3 ) while mildly sub - critical cases show oscillations as are found in the bound ( band 1 and higher ) self - similar solutions .",
    "fc93 interpret their maximum velocity peak in terms of a flat interior density distribution that passes abruptly to a @xmath44 profile .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show by linearizing the equations that an initially flattened density profile will first tend to evolve towards a still more flattened configuration on a free - fall timescale set by the cloud central density .",
    "physically this is due once again to the velocity profile of the fastest growing linear mode that is consistent with zero velocity at the cloud edge and at the cloud centre , since this is such that the outer layers overtake the inner ones .",
    "the linear calculation can only be suggestive , but in the generalized solutions of blottiau et al .",
    "( 1988 ) as well as in the band  0 solutions of ws85 , flattened centres and shells ( which would also collapse to give a point mass ) appear . moreover during the ` quasi - static ' evolution followed by basu & mouschovias ( 1995 ) , flattened supercritical cores appear .",
    "that a portion of this core collapses homologously is however less clear from their calculations ( depending on the ion - neutral collision time ) .      for the reasons given in sect .",
    "3.2 above , because of the nature of the abundant non - linear self - similar solutions ( ws85 ) , and because of the suggestive numerical study of fc93 , we now proceed to calculate an accretion history for a self - similar cloud based on the following hypothesis of pre - collapse evolution .",
    "+ in agreement with the observations , we suppose that the pre - collapse cloud core evolves quasi - statically , and develops a dense central region with a nearly flat density profile , until an external disturbance initiates the collapse .",
    "we further suppose that , after a transitional period ( leading to , e.g. , magnetic decoupling ) , the flat region is free to collapse suddenly , essentially homologously due to the absence of a pressure gradient .",
    "it is possible that further flattening of the profile occurs during the collapse . in any case",
    "the beginning of this free collapse is taken once again to be at @xmath78 , so that the completion of the core collapse is at @xmath46 , where @xmath76 is the free - fall time of a uniform sphere from rest , defined explicitly below .",
    "for all times @xmath79 we shall assume that the evolution is of the gravity - dominated self - similar form , given uniquely by the density profile at the @xmath58 epoch ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this is all that is required for the purposes of our calculation , but the flow has probably ceased to be pressure dominated even before @xmath80 . + an important point to realize is that the accretion rate at @xmath46 will not yet be that appropriate to the exterior of the cloud , since this will be for some time dominated by the collapsed core mass rather than by the self - gravity appropriate to the outer density profile .",
    "the subsequent transition to a constant asymptotic accretion rate happens as sufficient mass from the outer cloud is accreted to dominate the initial core mass .",
    "the equations include eq .",
    "( 1 ) above , plus those of appendix a and of h89 , h94 but with @xmath81 .",

    "+ the phase of enhanced accretion is thus apparently observable in @xmath4  oph but not in taurus .",
    "we suggest this is related to the fact that core collapse is probably induced by the impact of a weak interstellar shock wave in the first case ( e.g. vrba 1977 , loren & wootten 1986 ) and self - initiated by ambipolar diffusion in the second case ( e.g. lizano & shu 1989 , mouschovias 1991 ) .",
    "+ we conclude that the standard theory of shu and co - workers is roughly adequate in taurus but incomplete in @xmath4 oph . in the latter cloud",
    ", the accretion scenario advocated here provides a better fit to the data .",
    "further support to this view comes from the fact that the only candidate ` isothermal protostars ' known to date have precisely been found in regions of multiple star formation like @xmath4 oph , in the form of very dense compact clumps only seen at submillimeter wavelengths ( mezger et al .",
    "1992a , b ; chini et al .",
    "1997 ) . indeed , while the initial isothermal collapse phase is vanishingly short in the standard shu picture ( see sect .  1 ) , it should last for a significant fraction of the total collapse / accretion time if @xmath297 is large and if the scenario proposed in this paper is approximately correct ( see , e.g. , sect .",
    "the main points of our paper may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the radial density gradient of pre - stellar cores is typically flatter than @xmath298 near their centers and approach @xmath0 only beyond a few thousand au ( wsha , awm96 , fig .  1 ) . in some cases , sharp outer boundaries , much steeper than @xmath0 ,",
    "are observed at a finite core radius ( e.g. abergel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this raises the possibility that , in some instances at least , the initial conditions for protostellar collapse depart significantly from a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "the outflow momentum flux of embedded protostellar sources correlates very well with their circumstellar envelope mass ( see fig .  2 and fig .",
    "this suggests that the mass ejection and mass accretion rates of protostars both decline with time during protostellar evolution from class  0 to class  i sources ( batc ) .",
    "recent self - consistent hydrodynamical calculations of protostellar collapse indicate that initial conditions characterized by centrally flattened density profiles lead to a transitory phase of enhanced accretion immediately following the formation of the central hydrostatic protostar . this behavior is found regardless of whether the influence of magnetic fields is ignored ( fc93 ) or fully accounted for ( tomisaka 1996 ) .",
    "the nature of the transitory accretion peak is , however , left somewhat unclear by these numerical simulations .",
    "4 .   on the basis of ( 3 )",
    ", we propose that ( 2 ) is a direct consequence of ( 1 ) .",
    "5 .   in order to elucidate the physical origin of ( 3 ) , we analytically follow the history of protostellar accretion , using lagrangian calculations based on a new type of self - similar ` gravity - dominated ' collapse solutions ( sect .  3.2 , sect .  3.3 , and",
    "appendix  a ) .",
    "we claim that these new solutions provide a better description of the collapse than the usual ` pressure - dominated ' self - similar solutions ( e.g. shu77 , ws85 ) , when pressure becomes negligible in the self - gravitating flow sometime after the onset of collapse , prior to stellar core formation .",
    "comparison with the numerical simulations shows that the gravity - dominated solutions are adequate , at least qualitatively , in the supersonic region .",
    "6 .   in agreement with ( 1 ) , we start our supersonic calculations at @xmath299 from an idealized pre - stellar core consisting of a strictly flat inner plateau up to a radius @xmath75 , an @xmath44 ` envelope ' up to @xmath276 , and a steeper power - law ` environment ' farther out ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "in our gravity - dominated description , the central plateau region first collapses homologously to form a _ finite - mass _ hydrostatic stellar core at @xmath5 .",
    "observationally , this initial phase , which does not exist in the standard shu picture , should correspond to ` isothermal protostars ' , i.e. , supersonically collapsing cloud fragments with no central ysos .",
    "it is followed at @xmath294 by the main accretion / ejection phase , during which the non - zero central point mass accretes the surrounding envelope . as long",
    "as the gravitational influence of the initial point mass is significant , the accretion rate remains higher than the shu value , @xmath10 .",
    "it then quickly converges towards @xmath10 . at late times ,",
    "accretion of the outer environment leads to a terminal phase of residual accretion / ejection , during which the accretion rate declines below the shu value ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "we use our analytical model to fit the diagram of outflow efficiency @xmath180 versus normalized envelope mass @xmath181 obtained by batc ( see fig .",
    "to the extent that there is a direct proportionality between accretion and ejection , this diagram should provide an empirical measure of the accretion history of the sampled protostellar objects .",
    "a good overall fit is found when the model boundary radius @xmath276 , is not much larger than the radius @xmath75 of the flat inner plateau , i.e. , @xmath300 .",
    "this requires that the fraction of cloud mass in the central plateau region be relatively large , @xmath301  % .",
    "( however , since the collapse is in fact less violent than in our pressure - less calculations , these values of @xmath276 and @xmath85 should be taken as indicative , and are likely to represent only a lower limit and an upper limit , respectively . )",
    "8 .   based on ( 7 )",
    ", we tentatively associate the short period of energetic accretion / ejection predicted by our model at the beginning of the accretion phase with the observationally - defined class  0 stage ( sect .  4.1 and fig .  7 ) .",
    "in this view , class  i objects are more evolved and correspond to the longer period of moderate accretion / ejection when the accretion rate approaches the shu value .",
    "( see , however , point 10 below . )",
    "we also find that the ophiuchus @xmath180 versus @xmath181 diagram differs markedly from the corresponding diagram in taurus : a clear contrast between class  0 and class  i objects is observed in ophiuchus ( fig .",
    "9 ) which is not seen in taurus ( fig .",
    "this points to different accretion histories in these two nearby star - forming clouds , which we interpret as arising from differences in initial conditions ( sect .",
    "both outflow and dense core observations suggest that the relative importance of the central plateau region in the initial density profile is significantly larger in ophiuchus ( @xmath302 , @xmath303  % according to our approximate model ) than in taurus ( @xmath304 , @xmath305  % ) .",
    "10 . according to our model fit of the ophiuchus @xmath180 versus @xmath181 diagram",
    ", most of the @xmath4  oph class  i ysos should be in their terminal accretion phase ( see fig .",
    "this is not surprising since the relatively small fragmentation length scale observed in @xmath4  oph implies that only a finite reservoir of mass is effectively available for the formation of any given protostar .",
    "11 . in conclusion ,",
    "the ` standard ' theory of shu and co - workers appears to describe protostellar evolution quite satisfactorily in regions of isolated star formation like taurus . in our view , this is because in these regions most stars probably form following the _ self - initiated _ contraction / collapse of dense cores due to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "+ however , in star - forming clusters such as @xmath4  ophiuchi , the standard shu theory is less appopriate since it does not account for fragmentation and multiple star formation . in these regions ,",
    "star formation may be _ induced _ by the impact of ( slow ) shock waves ( e.g. boss 1995 ) , and protostellar cores may form by supersonic ( or superalfvnic ) implosion of dense clumps , rather than slow ( subsonic ) ambipolar evolution . in this case , the collapse / accretion history advocated in the present paper ( sect .",
    "3.3 ) and summarized in ( 6 ) is likely to provide a better description ( see fig .  9 and sect .  4.3 ) .",
    "in henriksen ( 1989  h89 ) it was shown in effect that in terms of a lagrangian label @xmath57 defined as the radial position of an isothermal spherical shell at a fiducial instant @xmath66 _ when the sphere is at rest _ , and a variable @xmath306 ( @xmath56 is the mass initially inside the radius @xmath57 ) , the subsequent position of the shell @xmath307 can be written as @xmath308 the ` scale factor ' @xmath309 obeys the equation @xmath310    here , we have defined @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the sound speed , and @xmath311 .",
    "the function @xmath65 is the initial density ( at @xmath80 ) that is related to @xmath56 through @xmath312 .",
    "we shall discuss the possible forms of this function further below .",
    "these equations are equivalent to the equations used previously in eulerian form by most other authors ( e.g. fc93 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath315 is one boundary condition and @xmath316 is another , but in addition we must impose an equilibrium condition if this is to be a ` natural ' starting point .",
    "the equilibrium condition consists in requiring @xmath65 to satisfy the lane - emden equation for an isothermal gas sphere .",
    "consequently it is either the general function @xmath317 discussed for example in chandrasekhar ( 1939 ) and used in the bonnor - ebert discussion of instability ( e.g. bonnor 1956 ) , or it is @xmath318 everywhere , which is the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) . in the latter event",
    "@xmath319 is constant and          the sis is exceptional in that eqs .",
    "( a2 ) and ( a3 ) show that the development can be immediately ` self - similar ' ; that is @xmath322 , and @xmath323 since @xmath324 for all @xmath57 .",
    "this is the initial condition and collapse first studied by shu77 and subsequently developed by shu and co - workers into the ` standard model ' of protostar formation .",
    "however , a closer inspection of eqs .",
    "( a2 ) and ( a3 ) combined with our knowledge of the expected parametric collapse instability discovered by bonnor and ebert reveals that there are several other possible lines of development .",
    "these are all based on the assumption that the initial equilibrium is _ not _ that of the sis , but rather a classical bonnor - ebert solution with a flattened core ( @xmath325 is finite and @xmath326 for small @xmath327 ) and a @xmath44 halo .    in general , if we ignore the somewhat artificial means of launching the collapse by a sudden cooling of the gas so that @xmath328 , the development from the bonnor - ebert sphere is clearly _ not _ self - similar since @xmath329 and @xmath330 are complicated functions or @xmath57 .",
    "but our fundamental theoretical remark in this paper is that a self - similarity in terms of the general variable @xmath331 ( as in ( a1 ) ) can develop dynamically if @xmath71 as the collapse develops . for then @xmath332 by eq .",
    "( a2 ) and the density tends to @xmath333 as used in the text .",
    "to place this idea in context it is worth remarking that none of the entire ` hyperbolic ' ( that is characterized by a wave propagation speed ) family of self - similar solutions found by ws85 can begin exactly from the bonnor - ebert initial condition either .",
    "they must then arise dynamically in the same way that we suggest occurs for the zero pressure flow .",
    "the ` band zero ' solutions may represent an intermediate stage however because of their flattened , dis - equilibrium , central peaks , as discussed in the text .",
    "such solutions are all constrained to pass through an instant where @xmath334 because of their assumption of the strict self - similar symmetry ( see e.g. carter & henriksen 1991 ) expressed in eq .",
    "( a5 ) ( normally authors set @xmath335 ) .",
    "this instant occurs at @xmath336 ( see e.g. eq .  1 of hunter 1977 ) which is normally taken to coincide with @xmath46 .",
    "this family of solutions may be discussed elegantly in terms of the lagrangian formulation as discussed in h89 .",
    "however since these solutions are well known ( ws85 ) , we pursue the novel idea in this paper as noted above , that the self - similar symmetry itself may change dynamically from that of ( a5 ) to that determined by @xmath95 where a more general mass or density profile is allowed .",
    "essentially we suppose that the symmetry changes from being ` hyperbolic ' to ` elliptic ' , which is the symmetry appropriate to the local acceleration that is present in a spherical flow dominated by gravity .",
    "this requires that the flow evolve away from the initial equilibrium under the influence of a bonnor - ebert - tomisaka type instability towards a density profile where @xmath329 is small compared to @xmath337 ( eq .",
    "a2 ) , at least in some finite region . at this instant , which we designate as @xmath338 in the text , where the gas will no longer be in equilibrium but rather in supersonic flow ( @xmath339 )",
    ", the current position of the mass shells becomes the new comoving variable @xmath57 .",
    "moreover @xmath332 becomes determined by the pressure - free version of eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the text , for which we take the bound solution that becomes eq .",
    "( 4 ) of the text near @xmath105 . here",
    "we distinguish between @xmath340 and @xmath338 to allow for an uncertain duration between the actual initiation of collapse and the onset of supersonic flow ( in the text the formulae are simplified by taking @xmath341 ) .",
    "this scenario will be realized in the vicinity of @xmath75 for example if at @xmath338 the density profile is roughly as in fig .",
    "3 of the text , _ and _ if @xmath342 .",
    "we assume that this condition is attained during the evolution between @xmath80 and @xmath343 . from this point on we describe the flow as possessing the elliptic self - similar symmetry of zero - pressure self - gravitating flow .",
    "one may note that the l / p solution , which seems to be a better ( although not perfect ) fit to the simulation results than is the s solution ( fc93 ) , also develops with @xmath329 small .",
    "in fact such a band  0 solution ( ws85 ) is described by eqs .",
    "( a2 ) ( with @xmath70 ) , ( a3 ) and ( a4 ) , and so we may calculate the radial velocity near the singularity as        however , the main message of this appendix is really the passage to the elliptic zero pressure self - similarity at @xmath343 , that we are advocating based on observational arguments and the theoretical arguments outlined above .",
    "we may make contact with the accretion rates found by shu77 and by fc93 by modifying slightly the argument of h94 .",
    "if as above @xmath75 is the initial radius at which the profile becomes sufficiently flat to initiate the homologous nuclear collapse then @xmath352 moreover we define here the equivalent of the ` virial ' radius used in h94 by referring to the dimensionless variable @xmath353 .",
    "this gives in the present context @xmath354 if the initial sphere were exactly bonnor - ebert , then the difference of density from @xmath83 at @xmath355 is @xmath356 ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1939 ) .",
    "thus @xmath357 to satisfy the flatness criterion .",
    "however we have detected a tendency for the density profile to flatten on the outside so it is possible that @xmath358 at the initiation of homologous collapse .",
    "thus we retain @xmath355 here as a parameter .",
    "as remarked in h94 , the preceding two relations can be rearranged into the useful forms @xmath359    and @xmath360 the units in terms of which we have calculated our accretion rate now follow as @xmath361 since moreover the asymptotic value of the accretion rate in these units was found above to be @xmath362 , we predict for the accretion plateau that is established as the @xmath44 outer region falls in the rate @xmath363 the numerical factor is @xmath364 so that @xmath365 in order to yield the asymptotic accretion rate predicted by the shu solution ( a numerical factor of @xmath366 in eq .",
    "this value of @xmath355 seems quite possible in view of the expected flattening .",

    "<S> 1996 ) suggests that mass ejection _ and _ mass accretion both decline significantly with time during protostellar evolution . in the present paper , we propose that this rapid decay of accretion / ejection activity is a direct result of the non - singular density profiles characterizing pre - collapse clouds . </S>",
    "<S> submillimeter dust continuum mapping indicates that the radial profiles of pre - stellar cores flatten out near their centers , being much flatter than @xmath0 at radii less than a few thousand au ( ward - thompson et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1994 ) . in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> sharp edges are observed at a finite core radius . </S>",
    "<S> here we show , through lagrangian analytical calculations , that the supersonic gravitational collapse of pre - stellar cloud cores with such centrally peaked , but flattened density profiles leads to a transitory phase of energetic accretion immediately following the formation of the central hydrostatic protostar . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the collapse occurs in various stages . </S>",
    "<S> the first stage corresponds to the nearly isothermal , dynamical collapse of the pre - stellar flat inner region , which ends with the formation of a finite - mass stellar nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is essentially non - existent in the ` standard ' singular model developed by shu and co - workers . in a second stage , the remaining cloud core material accretes supersonically onto a non - zero point mass . because of the significant infall velocity field achieved during the first collapse stage , the accretion rate is initially higher than in the shu model . </S>",
    "<S> this enhanced accretion persists as long as the gravitational pull of the initial point mass remains significant . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion rate then quickly converges towards the characteristic value @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the sound speed ) , which is also the constant rate found by shu ( 1977 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the model pre - stellar core has a finite outer boundary , there is a terminal decline of the accretion rate at late times due to the finite reservoir of mass . </S>",
    "<S> + we suggest that the initial epoch of vigorous accretion predicted by our non - singular model coincides with class  @xmath3 protostars , which would explain their unusually powerful jets compared to the more evolved class  i ysos . </S>",
    "<S> we use a simple two - component power - law model to fit the diagrams of outflow power versus envelope mass observed by bontemps et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1996 ) , and suggest that taurus and @xmath4 ophiuchi ysos follow different accretion histories because of differing initial conditions . while the isolated class  i </S>",
    "<S> sources of taurus are relatively well explained by the standard shu model , most of the class  i objects of the @xmath4 oph cluster may be effectively in their terminal accretion phase .    2 3 _ 13 13 800 _ </S>"
