    "semiconductor nanostructures have attracted increasing interest over the last couple of years .",
    "especially quantum dots ( qd ) are proposed as possible candidates in applications like single photon sources and quantum information devices .",
    "improved growth techniques nowadays enable the fabrication of small qds with a narrow size distribution .",
    "single , isolated qds embedded in a semiconductor matrix or in solution are of high interest for basic research .",
    "since their electronic properties are inevitable connected to the underlying lattice and its vibrations ( phonons ) they offer the possibility to study these fundamental interactions . while the theory for electron - phonon interaction in bulk systems is well established , the inhomogeneous nature of nanostructures leads to strong modifications of the electronic properties as well as the phonon spectrum .",
    "usually , qds are designed such that at least the energetically lowest state is spatially confined .",
    "the existence of boundaries between the constituting materials and/or to the vacuum introduces a coupling of the longitudinal and transverse phonon modes even for isotropic media .",
    "additionally , new types of confined interface and surfaces modes can occur .",
    "especially the electron - acoustic phonon interaction is of high interest since it is the source of so - called pure dephasing of optical excitations in qds , as detailed in recent articles  @xcite .",
    "the electron - acoustic phonon interaction is usually treated by deformation potential coupling , and acoustic phonons are described as bulk phonons .",
    "only recently some progress has been made to include phonons in inhomogeneous media in the treatment of electron - phonon interaction in slab and half space geometries  @xcite .",
    "so far to the best of our knowledge no investigations exist treating the modified phonons of the nanostructure itself in the interaction .",
    "the present article provides insights into the role of the phonon modification due to the nanostructure , including strain .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest case  a spherical qd  in order to describe the qualitative effect on the electron - acoustic phonon coupling .",
    "the details of the model and the corresponding theory are developed in sec .",
    "[ secmodel ] .",
    "calculations of strain dependent acoustic phonons on the basis of _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations are given in sec .",
    "[ secdft ] which serve as input for the calculation of the electron - phonon coupling function .",

    "epitaxial growth methods enable the fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures with sizes of a few nanometers only .",
    "the different materials are connected pseudomorphically , i.e. without structural defects .",
    "defects would lead to partial relaxation of intrinsic strain which results from different lattice constants of the constituents .",
    "the strain itself causes the change of physical properties compared to relaxed bulk materials .",
    "this includes the electronic ( band structure ) as well as the lattice properties ( phonons ) .",
    "the system we study in this article is a spherical shape inclusion ( quantum dot ) in an infinite matrix ( barrier ) .",
    "this artificial system should serve as test model for the relevance of non - bulk phonon modes in the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "for the material parameters we choose the prototype inas / gaas system . the first part is devoted to the description of the acoustic phonons within continuum elasticity theory followed by the description of the electron - acoustic phonon coupling .      in elastic continuum theory ,",
    "acoustic phonons follow from the wave equation of the displacement field @xmath0 @xmath1 here written in cartesian coordinates @xmath2 .",
    "both the mass density @xmath3 and the stress tensor @xmath4 are in general spatially dependent . in linear",
    "elasticity theory the stress tensor @xmath5 is proportional to the strain tensor @xmath6 defined by the spatial derivatives of the displacement fields , both quantities being related by the fourth order tensor of elastic constants @xmath7 ( hooke s law ) . for isotropic systems",
    "there are only two independent elastic constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are related to the well - known lam coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the stress tensor elements are then given by @xmath12 the restriction to isotropic media allows to treat the phonons in large part analytically .    for our spherical model system",
    "it is convenient to transform to spherical coordinates . for the specific electron - phonon coupling considered below",
    ", the only relevant phonon mode has angular momentum zero ( breathing mode ) , @xmath13 , which fulfills the equation @xmath14 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with elastic constants and mass density having an arbitrary radial dependence .",
    "this one - dimensional second - order differential equation contains the boundary conditions for a stepwise constant medium as well , which are @xmath15 we solve eq.([diff ] ) numerically , starting with a regular solution @xmath16 at the origin .",
    "the general normalization condition of the displacement within a large volume @xmath17 reads @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the discrete mode index .",
    "this normalization is converted into a matching condition at large distances with an outgoing wave containing a phase shift , as standard in scattering theory . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath19 is replaced by a ( continuous ) energy variable @xmath20 .",
    "the elastic constants in eq.([diff ] ) are not to be taken as the usual tabulated bulk values for the dot and the barrier material : the phonon calculation has to start from the reference state where the crystal is locally under finite strain .",
    "therefore the spatial dependency is not only due to the change in material but also due to the spatially varying strain .",
    "the usual treatment of continuum elasticity assumes fixed elastic constants . in our case , however , the system contains spatial regions where the material is strained .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that a material under compression would become harder due to the presence of anharmonic terms in the expansion of the free energy density around the equilibrium position , @xmath21 the equilibrium density is written as @xmath22 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to hydrostatic compressions in the following .",
    "an extension to general deformations is straightforward but numerically a far more complex task . allowing only small distorsions of the lattice ( an expansion up to second order is sufficient ) ,",
    "only the bulk modulus @xmath23 would be a constant quantity . including up to third order in the expansion an analytical derivation gives a linear dependence on the strength of the hydrostatic lattice distortion  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of elastic constants is possible directly by employing dft .",
    "starting from a relaxed unit cell under the application of finite deformations within density functional perturbation theory one can calculate the fourth order tensor of elastic constants .",
    "the density functional calculations are carried out with the abinit computer code  @xcite .",
    "the local density approximation is applied for the exchange - correlation .",

    "wave functions are expanded into plane waves with converged monkhorst - pack meshes of @xmath24 per @xmath25 unit cell and a cutoff energy of @xmath26ev .",
    "the dependence of the calculated elastic constants on the ( variable ) lattice constant , which corresponds to hydrostatic deformation , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] . in the range from -7% to + 7%",
    "lattice constant variation we find a nearly linear reduction of @xmath8 and @xmath27 with increasing the lattice constant , which is expected from a third order expansion  @xcite , showing that even for small distorsions the assumption of constant elasticity does not hold .",
    "the deviation from the linear behavior , especially for @xmath9 , is a clear indication that even higher orders than the third one influence significantly the effective elastic constants .",
    "numerical deviations from the experimental values are mainly due to the known underestimation of the lattice constant in lda for iii - v semiconductors ( see tab .",
    "[ tab01 ] ) . given a local static lattice distortion ,",
    "it is now possible to implement these elastic constants in the phonon calculation , which depend on the spatial position due to change in material and strain as well .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction has two main contributions : deformation potential coupling and piezo - electric coupling .",
    "the second contribution will not be considered here , although some of the following discussions apply also to this part .    for conduction electrons at the @xmath28-point in iii - v semiconductors the deformation potential couples only to a volume deformation ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath30 \\label{mainep}\\ ] ] with the ( material - dependent ) deformation potential constant for the conduction band @xmath31 and the phonon creation operator @xmath32 . in a qd with confinement functions @xmath33 of the electron , the relevant electron - phonon matrix elements are then @xmath34 the spherical symmetry of the qd leads to well - defined angular quantum numbers of the confinement levels , which select an appropriate symmetry of the lattice displacement .",
    "for electronic s - s - transitions , only the azimuthal quantum number @xmath35 is needed ( breathing mode ) . for the polaronic modification of a single electronic transition within the independent boson model  @xcite , the diagonal element in eq.([elphon ] ) is of central importance . concentrating on the lowest ( s - type ) confinement state @xmath36 , we need to calculate the following coupling function  @xcite @xmath37 for instance , the so - called broad band around the zero - phonon line at @xmath38 has a shape close to @xmath39 at elevated temperatures ( strictly speaking , the hole confinement state participating in the transition has to be included as well ) .",
    "in the following we present results for a spherical qd consisting of pure inas embedded in infinitely extended gaas . under hydrostatic compression",
    "the coordinates change according to @xmath40 .",
    "the deformation @xmath41 can be determined from the static solution ( @xmath42 ) of eq .",
    "[ diff ] . applying the boundary conditions from eq .",
    "[ boundary ] accordingly leads to @xmath43 with the lattice mismatch @xmath44 . for the present inas / gaas model system , it is @xmath45% using the experimental values given in tab .",
    "[ tab01 ] .",
    "the relaxed lattice constant @xmath46 of the dot material ( inas ) , which is compressed hydrostatically , is therefore @xmath47 ( last row of tab .",
    "[ tab01 ] , and indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] as dashed line . )    outside the dot , the material is compressed in radial direction but dilated laterally resulting in a zero net volume change .",
    "since we consider only hydrostatic compression the elastic properties are taken unchanged for the barrier material .",
    "we start by looking at the common approximation of using bulk phonons of the barrier material ( index b ) throughout .",
    "the solution of eq.([diff ] ) gives simply @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the spherical bessel function of the first kind , and the wave number is related to the energy via @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the longitudinal sound velocity ) .",
    "insertion into eq.([coupling ] ) leads to @xmath52 in this approximation , the coupling function ( divided by @xmath53 ) follows the ( squared ) fourier transform of the electron charge density , which decays on a scale of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the qd radius ) .    for the full problem",
    ", the displacement inside the dot ( index d ) is getting a prefactor , @xmath56 which has to be determined from solving eq .",
    "[ diff ] numerically .",
    "although the integration in the matrix element extends into the barrier material as well , it is mainly the variation of @xmath57 which modifies the coupling function . in order to implement the change in wave number ( sound velocity ) as well , we found it convenient to define a phonon amplitude as @xmath58 by definition , for bulk barrier phonons , @xmath59 which is the normalization used in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .    whereas for a free standing sphere as well as for a rigidly clamped sphere ,",
    "only discrete phonon energies are allowed , the qd embedded in an _ infinite _ elastic medium allows for a continuous manifold of phonon energies .",
    "however , the oscillating behavior of the phonon amplitude shown in fig .  [ fig02 ] resembles the eigenmodes of an isolated sphere .",
    "a specific feature is the reduction of the phonon amplitude at small energies : including the strain , its overall strength is reduced even further . doubling the size of the embedded dot from @xmath60 nm to @xmath61 nm leads to halve the energetic spacing between maxima , while the overall amplitude remains the same .",
    "this can be understood by noting that within the applied approximation , neither the static strain field nor the material density depends on the size of the qd .",
    ".parameters used in the calculation for the unstrained material  @xcite . given",
    "are also the theoretical lattice constants @xmath62 ( dft ) .",
    "last row : resulting values for the embedded strained inas quantum dot ( s - inas ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the calculation of the electron confinement wave function is done within the effective mass approximation including mass discontinuities .",
    "all relevant input variables are taken from existing literature  @xcite and given in tab.[tab01 ] .",
    "the compressive strain in the inas dot reduces the conduction band offset ( cbo ) significantly .",
    "the resulting electron confinement potential is plotted in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] together with the charge density in the lowest confinement state , @xmath63 . in the strained case ( fig .",
    "[ fig03]b ) , a larger tunneling of the wave function into the barrier can be seen .",
    "however , this change in the electronic wave function affects the electron - phonon coupling only marginal .    the coupling function eq.([coupling ] ) of electrons with acoustic phonons",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] comparing the strain free case ( a ) with the improved description including the strain present in the nanostructure ( b ) . within each panel",
    "the approximation of bulk phonons using either barrier ( gaas ) or dot ( inas ) material parameter are displayed , too .",
    "compared to dot - bulk phonons , a strong reduction is found , whereas barrier - bulk phonons are much closer to the full solution , although missing the existing structure in the coupling function .    the compressive strain results in an increased mass density ( see tab .",
    "[ tab01 ] ) , increased elastic constants in the dot and to a reduction of the coupling strength @xmath64 .",
    "the shape of the coupling function , however , is not much changed when including strain since the maximum positions in the phonon amplitude are only slightly shifted .",
    "the coupling is reduced further by increasing the size of the qd , see fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] . here ,",
    "the coupling function is even more structured ( sharp drop at around 1 mev ) which has its origin in the oscillatory variation of the phonon amplitude discussed before .",
    "including the details of the phonon characteristics in semiconductor nanostructures is essential for a quantitative description of the electron - acoustic phonon coupling .",
    "material parameters , i.e. mass density and elastic constants , are changed due to intrinsic strain in pseudomorphically grown heterostructures and are therefore spatially dependent . within continuum",

    "compared to the assumption of bulk phonons , an overall reduction of the electron - acoustic phonon coupling is found due to the nanostructure as well as due to strain .",
