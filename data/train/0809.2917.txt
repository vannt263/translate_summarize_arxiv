    "same approach ( with only minor modifications ) has been used since 2005 to demonstrate physics capabilities of the @xmath1 upgrade option of the lhc .",
    "results presented here were obtained assuming four different running scenarios for lehc :    * lepton beam energy of 70 gev , integrated luminosities of @xmath2 or @xmath3 fb@xmath4 , * lepton beam energy of 140 gev , integrated luminosities of @xmath5 or @xmath2 fb@xmath4 .    for details of the analysis method and the considered models",

    "if leptoquark yukawa coupling , @xmath7 , is of the order of the electroweak coupling or smaller , the resonance width is small compared to the expected precision of mass reconstruction . in such a case the narrow - width approximation ( nwa ) can be used to describe the cross - section for single leptoquark production in electron - proton ( for leptoquarks with fermion number @xmath8 ) or positron - proton ( for @xmath9 ) scattering : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the quark momentum distribution in the proton and @xmath12 .",
