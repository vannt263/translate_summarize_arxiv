    "nuclear collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies are aimed at creating a thermalized state of quarks and gluons called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . the weakly interacting picture of the qgp stems from the perception of asymptotic freedom of qcd at high temperatures and densities .",
    "however , the experimental data from rhic  @xcite , especially the measured elliptic flow of hadrons indicate that the matter produced in au+au collisions exhibit properties which are more like a strongly interacting liquid than a weakly interacting gas . the magnitude of the transport coefficients can be used to understand the strength of the interaction within the qgp .",
    "therefore , the study of the transport properties of qgp and hot hadrons is of paramount importance in characterizing the matter formed in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) at relativistic energies .",
    "for example , the shear viscosity or the internal friction of the fluid symbolizes the ability to transfer momentum over a distance of about a mean free path .",
    "therefore , in a system where the constituents interact strongly the transfer of momentum is performed easily - resulting in lower values of @xmath1 .",
    "consequently such a system may be characterized by a small value of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the entropy density . on the other hand , for a weakly interacting system the momentum transfer between the constituents become strenuous which gives rise to large @xmath1 .",
    "the importance of viscosity also lies in the fact that it damps out the variation in the velocity and makes the fluid flow laminar . a very small viscosity ( large reynold number )",
    "may make the flow turbulent .",
    "a lower bound on the value of @xmath2 has been found using ads / cft  @xcite ( see also  @xcite )",
    ".    collisions between nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies produce charged particles - either in the hadronic or in the partonic state , depending on the collision energy .",
    "interactions among these charged particles produce real photons .",
    "because of their nature of interaction , the mean free path of photons in the medium ( hadronic or partonic ) is large compared to the size of the system formed in hic .",
    "therefore , photons emanating from such a system brings out the information of the source point very efficiently  @xcite ( see  @xcite for review ) and hence electromagnetic probes ( photons and lepton pairs ) may play crucial role in extracting the transport coefficients .",
    "the effects of viscosity on the photon spectra resulting from hic enter through two main factors : ( i ) the modification of the phase space factor due to the deviation of the system from equilibrium and ( ii ) the space time evolution of the matter governed by dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "one more important issue deserves to be mentioned here .",
    "normally , the initial temperature ( @xmath4 ) and the thermalization time ( @xmath5 ) are constrained by the measured hadron multiplicity ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this approach is valid for a system where there is no viscous loss and the time reversal symmetry is valid .",
    "however , for a viscous system the entropy at the freeze - out point ( which is proportional to the multiplicity ) contains the initially produced entropy as well as the entropy produced during the space time evolution due to non - zero shear and bulk viscosity .",
    "therefore , the amount of entropy generated during the evolution has to be subtracted from the total entropy at the freeze - out point and the remaining part which is produced initially should be used to estimate the initial temperature .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath6 ( which is associated with the freeze - out point ) and @xmath5 the magnitude of @xmath4 will be lower in case of viscous dynamics compared to ideal flow .",
    "effects of viscosity on the transverse momentum distribution of photons was earlier considered in  @xcite and recently the interest in this field is renewed  @xcite . beyond a certain threshold in collision energy the system",
    "is expected to be formed in qgp phase which will inevitably make a transition to the hadronic matter later .",
    "the measured spectra contain contributions from both qgp and hadronic phases .",
    "therefore , it becomes imperative to estimate the photon emission with viscous effects from qgp as well as hadrons and identify a kinematic window where photons from qgp dominate .",
    "while in some of the earlier works  @xcite contributions from hadrons were ignored , in others  @xcite the effects of dissipation on the phase space factors were omitted . in the present work we study the effects of viscosity on the thermal photon spectra originating from qgp and hadronic matter and argue that photons can be used as a very useful tool to estimate @xmath2 and hence characterize the matter .",
    "the paper is planned as follows . in the next section the kinetic theory formalism for evaluating the photon emission rate in the independent particle approximation  @xcite",
    "is discussed . in section iii",
    "we discuss the viscous effects on the phase space distributions of the partons or hadrons participating in the photon production processes .",
    "hydrodynamical evolution with viscous effects has been mentioned in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to results and section vi is dedicated to the summary and discussion .",
    "the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution of photons from a reaction of the type : @xmath7 taking place in a thermal bath at a temperature , @xmath8 is given by  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the rate of photon production per unit four - volume , @xmath11 is the over all degeneracy for the reaction under consideration , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the three momentum , energy and thermal phase space factor of the particle @xmath15 ( either parton or hadron ) .",
    "@xmath16 is the square of the invariant amplitude for the process under consideration . after some straight forward algebra eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] can be simplified to ( see appendix a ) : @xmath17    the collision of nuclei at rhic and lhc energies is expected to produce qgp .",
    "this state of matter , once created with high internal pressure will undergo rapid expansion and consequently will cool down to the temperature , @xmath18 for qgp to hadron transition . in a first order phase transition scenario",
    "the system remains in a mixed phase of qgp and hadrons at @xmath18 until a time where the entire qgp converts to hadrons .",
    "the thermal equilibrium may also be maintained in the hot hadronic phase till the freeze - out point ( achieved at a temperature , @xmath19 ) where the mean free path of the hadrons is too large for collisions to take place .",
    "the measured photon spectra ( @xmath20 ) is the yield obtained after performing the space time integration over the entire evolution history - from the initial state to the freeze - out point .",
    "therefore , eq .  [ eq2 ] needs to be integrated over the four volume to connect the theoretical results with experiments : @xmath21_{i } \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 represents qgp , mixed ( coexisting phase of qgp and hadrons ) and hadronic phases respectively .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) that initial temperature for system which evolves with non - zero viscous effects is lower compared to the ideal case for a fixed @xmath6 . because for a non - viscous isentropic evolution scenario the multiplicity ( measured at the freeze - out point ) is fixed by the initial entropy",
    ". however , for a viscous evolution scenario the generation of entropy due to dissipative effects contributes to the multiplicity .",
    "therefore , for a given multiplicity ( which is proportional to the entropy ) at the freeze - out point one requires lower initial entropy , hence initial temperature will be lower .",
    "it is also seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) that the cooling of the system is slower for viscous dynamics because of the extra heat generated during the evolution .      in this section",

[ eq10 ] ) and scenario ( ii ) where the effects of @xmath115 are taken into account in the phase space factors as well as in the evolution dynamics . the space time integrated photon yield originating from the qgp in scenario ( i ) is displayed in fig .",

    "the enhancement in the photon production due to change in phase space factor , @xmath113 is partially compensated by the reduction in @xmath4 for non - zero @xmath1 , which is clearly seen in the results displayed in figs .  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] .    in figs .",

    "we have studied the effects of viscosity on the evolving qgp produced in nuclear collisions at rhic energies .",
    "the generation of entropy due to dissipation on the final ( experimentally measured ) multiplicity has been taken into account .",
    "the initial temperature has been constrained by the multiplicity ( entropy ) at the freeze - out point .",
    "the viscous effects on the photon spectra has been introduced consistently through the evolution dynamics and phase space factors of the particles participating in the production processes .",
    "it has been noticed that the effects of viscosity on the photons from qgp is stronger than those originating from hadrons .",
    "the qgp expected to be formed in pb+pb collisions at lhc energy will have longer life time and larger volume than that of rhic _",
    "i.e. _ the evolution dynamics at lhc will be dominated by qgp phase .",
    "therefore , the chance of estimating the value of @xmath2 from photon at lhc is brighter . in view of the fact that the future experiments are progressing toward precision measurement",
    "the shift in the @xmath0 distribution of photons due to dissipative effects at lhc and rhic may be detectable .    before closing this section two comments are in order here .",
    "first , as mentioned before for the photon production rate from qgp we have used the compton and annihilation processes .",
    "we have checked that the contribution from these two processes is down by a factor of 3 - 4 compared to the production rate obtained from the complete calculation of order @xmath31 done in ref .",
    "@xcite . taking these",
    "higher order processes into consideration in the present scenario involves a reevaluation of the photon production rates with thermal distribution factors containing viscous corrections .",
    "secondly , we have confined only to the longitudinal flow of the matter in the present work ignoring the transverse kick ( blue shift ) received by the photons from radial flow  @xcite . however , both these factors will affect the photon spectra from ideal as well as dissipative scenarios in a similar fashion .",
    "therefore , we expect the shift in the transverse momentum spectra of thermal photons in the presence of dissipative effects which is the main focus of the present work , will be detectable even when a more rigorous photon production rate along with transverse expansion is employed  @xcite",
