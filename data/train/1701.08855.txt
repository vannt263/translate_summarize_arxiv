    "many porous media related practical problems lead to the numerical approximation of the pressure equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the part of the boundary of the domain @xmath2 ( denoted by @xmath3 ) where the dirichlet boundary condition is imposed . in case",
    "the measure of @xmath1 ( denoted by @xmath4 ) is zero , we assume the compatibility condition @xmath5 . on the above equation",
    "we have assumed without loss of generality homogenous boundary conditions since we can always reduce the problem to that case .",
    "the domain @xmath2 is assumed to be a convex polygonal region .",
    "we note however that this convexity is not required for the discretization , it is required only when regularity theory of partial differential equations ( pdes ) is considered for establishing the a priori error estimates .",
    "in multi - phase immiscible incompressible flow , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the unknown pressure and the given phase mobitity of one of the phases in consideration ( water , oil or gas ) ; ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in general",
    ", the forcing term @xmath8 is due to gravity , phase transitions , sources and sinks , or when we transform a nonhomogeneous boundary condition problem to a homogeneous one .",
    "the mobility phase in consideration is defined by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the absolute ( intrinsic ) permeability of the porous media , @xmath11 is the relative phase permeability and @xmath12 the phase viscosity of the fluid .    efficiently and accurately solving the equations like ( [ eq : problem1 ] ) governing fluid flow in oil reservoirs as well as in groundwater modeling and simulation of flow linked to advective / convective transport phenomena ( e.g. , @xcite ) is very challenging because of the complex porous media environment and the intricate properties of fluid phases .",
    "a key ingredient on the transport phenomena in porous media and related real - life applications is precisely the well - known darcy law in which linked to equations in ( [ eq : problem1 ] ) is a fundamental pde with a wide spectrum of relevance .",
    "it is fundamental in applied mathematics @xcite and for modeling fluid flow through porous media @xcite as well as of a benchmark prototype model for proof - of - concept , efficient implementation and rigorous analysis for the design and development of new finite element approaches , as the one discussed here , but also for other novel procedures , for instance msfem @xcite , virtual finite elements @xcite , classical mixed finite elements @xcite . indeed , discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) formulations have become an increasingly popular way to discretize the darcy flow equations , either in the mixed finite element dg @xcite or in the stabilized mixed dg @xcite framework , just to name a few of the relevance of model problem ( [ eq : problem1 ] ) from different perspectives .",
    "the field of fluid flow simulation in petroleum reservoirs @xcite as well as the groundwater modeling and simulation of flow @xcite linked to several transport phenomena have seen significant advances in the last few decades ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) due to novel discretizations associated do darcy problem ( [ eq : problem1 ] ) , along with the challenges in modeling : flow and transport .",
    "we emphasize the challenges in the construction of new methodologies into a reservoir simulation should have into account the following issues :    * local mass conservation properties ; * stable - fast solver , and ; * the flexibility of re - use of the novel technique into more complex models ( such as to nonlinear time - dependent equations ) .",
    "also , the convergence of the method should be studied for various kinds of heterogeneities linked to flow in porous media transport problems , as such incompressible immiscible two - phase flow @xcite and incompressible immiscible three - phase flow @xcite ; see also the references cited therein .",
    "the impact of porous media heterogeneity on darcy flow is very relevant .",
    "a review of studies on such topic over the recent past decades can be found in @xcite .",
    "even with modern novel techniques simulation of darcy flows through a heterogeneous porous medium with fine - scale features can be computationally expensive if the flow is fully resolved . moreover , the unstable displacement of fluids with different viscosities , or viscous fingering provides a powerful mechanism to increase fluid - fluid interfacial area and enhance mixing that in linked to the mobility phase in consideration ; ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , fast multiscale reservoir simulations using darcy flow reduced - order models based on the model problem ( [ eq : problem1 ] ) is still up to date @xcite .",
    "the main goal of our work is to obtain conservative solution of the equations above when they are discretized by high order continuous piecewise polynomial spaces .",
    "the obtained solution satisfies some given set of linear restrictions ( may be related to subdomains of interest ) .",
    "our motivations come from the fact that in some applications it is to have some conservative properties represented as conservations of total flux in control volumes .",
    "for instance , if @xmath13 represents the approximation to the flux ( in our case @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the approximation of the pressure ) , it is required that @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a control volume that does not cross @xmath1 from a set of controls volumes of interest , and here and after @xmath18 is the normal vector pointing out the control volume in consideration .",
    "if some appropriate version of the total flux restriction written above holds , the method that produces such an approximation is said to be a conservative discretization .",
    "several schemes offer conservative discrete solutions .",
    "these schemes depend on the formulation to be approximated numerically . among the conservative discretizations for the second the order formulation the elliptic problem we mention the finite volume ( fv ) method , some finite difference methods and some discontinuous galerkin methods . on the other hand , for the first order formulation or the darcy system we have the mixed finite element methods and some hybridizable discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) methods .    in this paper , we consider methods that discretize the second order formulation .",
    "working with the second order formulation makes sense especially for cases where some form or high regularity holds .",
    "usually in these cases the equality in the second order formulation is an equality in @xmath19 so that , in principle , there will be no need to weaken the equality by introducing less regular spaces for the pressure as it is done in mixed formulation with @xmath19 pressure .    among the method mentioned above , and especially for second order problems ,",
    "a very popular conservative discretization is the fv method .",
    "the classical fv discretization provides and approximation of the solution in the space of piecewise linear functions with respect to a triangulation while satisfying conservation of mass on elements of a dual triangulation .",
    "when the approximation of the piecewise linear space is not enough for the problem at hand , advance approximation spaces need to be used ( e.g. , for problems with smooth solutions some high order approximation may be of interest ) .",
    "however , in some cases , this requires a sacrifice of the conservation properties of the fv method . here in this paper , we design and analyze conservative solution in spaces of high order piecewise polynomials .",
    "we follow the methodology @xcite that imposes the total flux restrictions by employing lagrange multiplier technique .",
    "we note that fv methods that use higher degree piecewise polynomials have been introduced in the literature .",
    "the fact that the dimension of the approximation spaces is larger than the number of restrictions led the researchers to design some method to select solutions : for instance , in @xcite to introduce additional control volumes to match the number of restrictions to the number of unknowns .",
    "it is also possible to consider a petrov - galerkin formulation with additional test functions rather that only piecewise constant functions on the dual grid .",
    "another approaches have been also introduced , see for instance @xcite and references therein .    here in this paper",
    ", we consider a ritz formulation and construct a solution procedure that combines a continuous galerkin - type formulation that concurrently satisfies mass conservation restrictions .",
    "we impose finite volume restrictions by using a scalar lagrange multiplier for each restriction .",
    "this is equivalently to a constraint minimization problem where we minimize the energy functional of the equation restricted to the subspace of functions that satisfy the conservation of mass restrictions .",
    "then , in the ritz sense , the obtained solution is the best among all functions that satisfy the mass conservation restriction .",
    "another advantage of our formulation is that the analysis can be carried out with classical tools for analyzing approximations to saddle point problems @xcite .",
    "we carried out and abstract analysis and present a detailed example for the case of second order piecewise polynomials .",
    "an important finding of these paper is that we where able to obtain optimal error estimates in the @xmath20 norm as well as the @xmath19 norm .",
    "as far as we are informed , optimal @xmath19 approximation is obtained only for specially collocated dual meshes .",
    "the optimal @xmath19 approximation is obtained adding the lagrange to the approximation @xmath21 by an aubin - nitsche trick ; ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath19 bound is a theoretical advantage of using a symmetric formulation for a conservative method .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "we impose it as a restriction ( by using lagrange multipliers ) in each control volume @xmath44 .",
    "we mention that our formulation allows for a more general case where only few control volumes , not necessarily related to the primal triangulation , are selected .",
    "let us define the linear functional @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "we first note @xmath47 is not well defined for @xmath48 . to fix that , note that @xmath49 , therefore , let us define the hilbert space @xmath50 with norm @xmath51 .",

    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "then , in case an approximation of @xmath6 , say @xmath21 is required to satisfy the constraints @xmath60 , @xmath61 , we can do that by discretizing directly the formulation . in particular",
    ", we can apply this approach to a set of mass conservation restrictions used in finite volume discretizations .    in order to proceed with the associate lagrange formulation ,",
    "we define @xmath62 to be the space of piecewise constant functions on the dual mesh @xmath63 .",

    "as we previously announced , we have emphasized the challenges in the construction of new methodologies into a reservoir simulation should have into account the following issues : 1 ) local mass conservation properties , 2 ) stable - fast solver and 3 ) the flexibility of re - use of the novel technique into more complex models ( such as to nonlinear time - dependent transport equations equation for the convection dominated transport equation ) . for darcy - like model problems with very high contrasts in heterogeneity , the discretization of model ( [ eq : problem1 ] ) alone may be very hard to solve numerically due to a large condition number of the arising stiffness matrix .",
    "moreover , the situation in even more intricate for modeling non trivial two- @xcite and three - phase @xcite transport convection dominated phenomena problems for flow through porous media ( see also other relevant works @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , existence , uniqueness and regularity issues for such problems at a fine level out of reach .",
    "thus , numerical simulation of fluid dynamics provide insight into the numerical simulation of fluid flow linked to theory , numerics and applications .    with this in mind , as a future perspective is to plug our novel high - order conservative finite element method in a numerical simulator . for the purpose of such study",
    "it is necessary to describe a coupled pressure - velocity ( elliptic ) and convection dominated transport ( parabolic with a strong hyperbolic character ) conservative solution and stable - fast algorithm to model essentially the interface capturing problems for multiphase flows where neither of the phases can be regarded as dominant .",
    "while the volume fractions ( or saturation ) are gained by solving the pertinent transport equations , fluid flow velocity is solved by solving the darcy pressure problem ; although the need of the pressure as primary unknown , is just the darcy velocity that we need to plug into the convection dominated transport system .",
    "thus , to achieve a sufficiently coupling between the volume fractions ( or saturation ) and the pressure - velocity , the full problem can be treated along with a fractional - step numerical procedure @xcite ; we point out that we are aware about the very delicate issues linked to the discontinuous capillary - pressure ( see @xcite and the references therein ) ; such issues must be considered no matter how is the time discretization of the convection dominated transport , namely , explicitly or implicitly . before continuing , remember that figure [ figure1 ] illustrates a primal @xmath236 and dual @xmath63 mesh made of squares .",
    "thus , a feasible time marching algorithm ( see , e.g. @xcite ) to the full set of nonlinear differential model saturation - pressure - velocity equations is given by solving for the saturation , in hyperbolic -parabolic sub - steps , and the total darcy velocity , in the velocity - pressure sub - steps . the approximation of elliptic pressure equation will take advantage of our high - order conservative finite element method while the transport equation can be handle by fast - accurate finite - volume method , by combining primal and dual meshes as we are using here .    indeed",
    ", the fluxes ( darcy velocities ) are smooth at the vertices of the cell defining the integration volume in the dual triangularization , since these vertices are located at the centers of non - staggered cells , away from the jump discontinuities along the edges .",
    "this facilitates the construction of second - order and high - order approximations linked to the hyperbolic - parabolic model problem .",
    "this also means that the pertinent spatial integrals can be approximated in a straightforward manner .",
    "for instance , the finite volume differencing @xcite , unlike upwind differencing , bypasses the need for riemann solvers , yielding simplicity , avoiding dimensional splitting in multi - dimensional problems .",
    "in particular , such framework also allows for the extension of the scheme to hyperbolic systems by component - wise application of the scalar framework ( for more details see @xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "moreover , at the same vertices of the integration volume , the novel high - order conservative finite element method gives the best accurate velocity field even in the presence of highly variable permeability fields , providing useful insights into the numerical simulation of fluid flow .",
    "this gives some of the benefits of staggering between primal and dual mesh triangulation by combining our novel high - order conservative finite element method with finite volume for hyperbolic - parabolic conservation laws modeling fluid flow in oil reservoirs and groundwater modeling as well as associated hazards of contamination and transport by ground water , co2 geological sequestration and storage , acid mine drainage remediation , just to name a few up to date subsurface hydrology and groundwater modeling , and geothermal energy associated to petroleum science and engineering .",
