    ", the measurements of any two cp - violating experiments must be related through cp - conserving quantities . in principle , this makes the sm a very predictive theory of cp violation . in practice , however , the cp - conserving quantities required to extract weak interaction parameters from experiment usually involve the strong interaction , are difficult to calculate , and the interpretations of the experiments in terms of parameters of the original lagrangian are plagued by hadronic uncertainties .",
    "one notable exception occurs with the determination of @xmath6 from the time dependent asymmetry in @xmath2 . in the sm , and with the usual phase convention , @xmath7 is the phase of @xmath8 .",
    "the current world average is @xcite @xmath9 based on the very precise measurements by babar @xcite and belle @xcite . in this article , we will also consider the possibility that there might be new physics contributions affecting the phase of @xmath5 mixing @xcite . in that case",

    "the current measurement of @xmath11 is in agreement with measurements based on @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and cp violation in the @xmath15 system , although each of these is plagued by hadronic uncertainties .",
    "so , we would like to constrain the ckm source of cp violation in as many ways as possible , in the hope of uncovering new physics effects .",
    "one possibility arises in the time - dependent asymmetry in @xmath1 decays .",
    "if there were only contributions from tree level diagrams , this would provide a clean measurement of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of penguin contributions with a different weak phase imply that this measurement is plagued by hadronic uncertainties .",
    "one way out of this problem consists in estimating this penguin pollution in some way ( see section  [ sec : exptheor ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : l+- ] ) , and this sign can not be determined from the usual experiments with @xmath2 decays @xcite .",

    "the bound from @xmath130 is much tighter than the bound from @xmath127 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 is constrained by the bound from @xmath127 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] that our assumption of positive @xmath94 plays a crucial role . indeed",

    "this occurs for @xmath138 as can be seen in the figure and understood from eq .",
