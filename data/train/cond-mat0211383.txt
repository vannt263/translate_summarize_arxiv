    "<S> we establish a relationship between the small - world behavior found in complex networks and a family of random walks trajectories using , as a linking bridge , a maze iconography . </S>",
    "<S> simple methods to generate mazes using random walks are discussed along with related issues and it is explained how to interpret mazes as graphs and loops as shortcuts . </S>",
    "<S> small - world behavior was found to be non - logarithmic but power - law in this model , we discuss the reason for this peculiar scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> small world ( sw ) graphs efficiently interpolate between regular and random graphs thanks to a small number @xmath0 of _ shortcuts _ ( long - range connections ) which are superimposed on a regular graph formed by @xmath1 nodes . in random graphs , the mean minimal distance or diameter between all pairs of nodes in </S>",
    "<S> the system scales logarithmically with the system size , while it does it linearly in regular graphs . </S>",
    "<S> much attention has been devoted recently to the topological properties of such graphs and to the effects that a sw - like connectivity may have on the properties of dynamical systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a number of papers relating random walks ( rw ) and sw phenomenon @xcite . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the authors examine rw on sw networks , in particular the probability of a random walker of being at the original site at a later time . </S>",
    "<S> their interest stem from the motion of excitons over polymer chains , where steps between spatially close sites can connect regions far apart along the chemical backbone . </S>",
    "<S> however his model follows a standard sw network building @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later the same authors @xcite , considering self - avoiding constrains , assume that the probability that two sites far apart along the backbone come close together in space is approximately an inverse power law of their mutual distance . </S>",
    "<S> in other studies rw have been employed as dynamical nodes to study dynamical sw effects @xcite . furthermore and in another context , </S>",
    "<S> rw on the family of sw networks have been addressed where rw correspond to random spread of information over the network @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated that the average access time between nodes for a sw geometry shows a crossover from regular to random behavior with increasing distance from the starting point of the rw . </S>",
    "<S> average access time is important in any markov process and is very relevant for the exploring and navigation of the www @xcite that , as a scale - free network , it also shows the sw effect .     </S>",
    "<S> an illustrative example of short - cut by loop in the rw path or maze : ( a ) the path * 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 12 - 13 - 14 - 15 - 16 - 17 - 18 - 19 - 20 - 21 * of @xmath2 steps traced by a rw , can be interpreted as a maze of length @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) to solve the maze is : to travel starting at * 1 * , and ending at * 21*. one non - optimal solution is a travel of length @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) at step @xmath4 the path has a self - intersection with step 8 , a loop * 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 12 - 13 - 14 - 15 - 16 - 17 - 18*.(d ) we can avoid this loop to solve optimally the maze . </S>",
    "<S> then , the loop acts as a short - cut in the graph version of the maze : the node * 8 * is connected with the node * 9 * and * 19*.(e ) to solve efficiently the maze we use the minimal distance @xmath5 between nodes * 1 * and * 21 * : * 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 19 - 20 - 21*. ( f ) then , the length of the maze is @xmath2 , but using the short - cut , it is solved in @xmath6 . ]     </S>",
    "<S> upper figures : three examples of mazes generated by rws with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 with a proper choice of the scale . </S>",
    "<S> main figure : the effect of growth @xmath10 on the minimal distance @xmath11 normalized by @xmath1 in the path graph for several sizes @xmath1 and log - lineal axes . for all simulations in this article , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 points separated logarithmically between @xmath13 and @xmath14 were considered . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> each point represents the mean of @xmath15 numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the path sizes ( or graph sizes ) of the rw are : @xmath16 ( filled circles ) , @xmath17 ( triangles ) , @xmath18 ( squares ) , and @xmath19 ( empty circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> we notice a size - effect in @xmath11 similar to the one in the classic sw model that predicts a transition at @xmath20 and @xmath21 . ]    in this paper we study the properties of two dimensional complex mazes from the point of view of the sw theory . for this </S>",
    "<S> , it is important to explore new methods ( such as the use of the properties of excitable media @xcite ) to find minimum - length paths in complex labyrinths . </S>",
    "<S> navigational methods for solving mazes are widely applied in computer sciences for searching through data structures and the so - called depth - first search method is an example @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we use non - reversing rw in two dimensions for generating mazes @xcite . we may interpret the trajectory of the non - reversing rw in a plane as a directed graph in the following sense : each site reached at step @xmath22 by the rw , is a node labeled by @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the nodes are connected in the step sequence , i. e. : @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> but if a loop exists , for example @xmath22-step intersect with @xmath24-step then we connect @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> . therefore the loops act as shortcuts in the graph . in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we show an example : a path traced by one of this non - reversing rw . </S>",
    "<S> the path is the maze and solving it consist in discovering the minimum number of steps , the minimum path from the first site to the last site traced by the rw . as we can see self - intersections are no avoided and so loops are permitted . thus jumping the loops </S>",
    "<S> is a way for quickly reaching the exit .    to generate a specific maze we fix the number @xmath1 of steps of the non - reversing rw and the probability @xmath26 $ ] </S>",
    "<S> in each step the rw will vary his direction with probability @xmath10 : at right with probability @xmath27 or at left with the same probability . and </S>",
    "<S> with probability @xmath28 the rw will not turn . in this manner </S>",
    "<S> we can construct a variety of mazes . from @xmath29 that produces linear trajectories to @xmath30 that gives intricate trajectories with equal probability to continue straight , turn right or </S>",
    "<S> turn left . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the number of self - interactions grows with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> each time a self - interaction occurs , there is a new loop .    in the upper insets of figure 2 we shown three cases , with a proper choice of the scale , for non - reversing rws with @xmath18 steps . </S>",
    "<S> a very little value of @xmath10 such as @xmath7 produces a maze without loops . </S>",
    "<S> a value of @xmath8 generates mazes with a moderate number of loops . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a value of @xmath9 generates very intricate mazes . </S>",
    "<S> because increasing @xmath10 imply an increase in the number of loops or equivalent short - cuts on a lineal trajectory or regular graph , we expect sw behavior in the model . </S>",
    "<S> we point out two differences with standard sw model : here the links are direct and the shortcuts are self - created by the system dynamics .    in the present work , the sw effect is used in the sense that the maze can be solved , walked from the start to the end , within few steps on the average , in spite of the relatively low number of loops present in the system . in the main plot at figure 2 , </S>",
    "<S> the sw effect is evident . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 represents the number of steps taken by the rw and so the maximum number of steps that takes going from the start to the end of the maze . if the number of path - intersections are regarded as shortcuts , then the minimal distance @xmath11 is dramatically reduced with small increments of @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> log - log graph showing the scaling of the number of rw steps @xmath31 that takes to reach the first short - cut or the first loop as a function of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the line with slope @xmath32 is a guide for the eye . </S>",
    "<S> the linear fitting on the scaling region gives @xmath33 . ]    similarly to the sw standard model , it is possible to determine a persistence length @xmath31 , that is the mean number of steps needed for producing the first loop or shortcut . in figure 3 , it is depicted the simple dependence regarding @xmath10 : @xmath34 , that is equivalent to the average number of steps that a rw must take before turning for the first time .    on figure 4 </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that the following scaling relationship is satisfied :    @xmath35    if @xmath36 is proportional to the mean number of rw steps for producing one loop , @xmath37 can be interpreted as the mean number of loops in a system with size @xmath1 and probability @xmath10 in its building . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling function @xmath38 behaves linearly for values of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , while @xmath0 -the average number of turnings- is less than one there are no shortcuts in the maze and the value of @xmath1 matches @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath40 the presence of shortcuts has an impact and the distance @xmath11 is reduced following a power - law with an exponent value @xmath41 equal to @xmath42 when the size of the maze is increase .    </S>",
    "<S> we depict in figure 5 a collapse plot of the scaling function @xmath43 :    @xmath44    @xmath43 may be interpreted as the reduction factor in the start - end maze distance as a function of the size and the turning rate on the system given by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> again , for values of @xmath39 , @xmath11 and @xmath1 take the same value . however , as @xmath1 or @xmath10 are increase in such a way that @xmath45 the ratio @xmath46 decreases as a power law with an exponent value @xmath47 equal to @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> both results confirm that : @xmath49 for no loops or @xmath50 . on the other hand : @xmath51 for @xmath52 , when loops appears . </S>",
    "<S> this result is particular for the present model , because in the classic sw model the mean distance scales as @xmath53 and in the present system it scales as a power - law with exponent @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> why the model presents this sw effect in a power - law form ? </S>",
    "<S> for our numerical experiments we have computed the euclidian distance @xmath54 in the two dimensional plane of the line linking the start with the end of the maze , the classical end - to - end distance for a rw . for a typical rw in two dimensions @xmath54 scales with @xmath1 as @xmath55 . in figure 6 </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how @xmath56 scales with @xmath0 as a power - law with exponent @xmath57 : @xmath58 +    scaling relation between the end - to - end distance @xmath54 and @xmath1 , the number of the rw steps rescaled both by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the line with slope @xmath57 is a guide for the eye . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling exponent obtained by fitting on the scaling region is @xmath59 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this result shows that the maze model acts as a typical rw model of @xmath1 steps in two dimensions where @xmath1 and @xmath54 are scaled by @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> self - avoiding random walks ( saw ) are rw where trajectories self - intersections are avoided . in our model </S>",
    "<S> once the rw trajectory is finished , deleting the loops produces a saw of length @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> its known that in a typical saw model in two dimensions of @xmath11 steps we can expected @xmath60 @xcite as scaling relation . </S>",
    "<S> this imply in our model , that after rescaled @xmath54 and @xmath11 as @xmath56 and @xmath61 :    @xmath62    in figure ( 7 ) the above scaling relationship is confirmed .    </S>",
    "<S> then , after combining equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we can recover equation ( 4 ) . the sw effect in the two dimensional model as a power - law scaling between @xmath1 and @xmath11 with exponent @xmath42 for values @xmath0 , is a direct consequence of the well - known scaling relations in classical rw and saw models .     scaling relation between the end - to - end distance @xmath54 and @xmath11 scaled both by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the line with slope @xmath63 is a guide for the eye . </S>",
    "<S> scaling exponent obtained on the scaling region by fitting is @xmath64 . ] </S>"
