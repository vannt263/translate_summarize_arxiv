    "the several - variable case is much harder and there are only a few examples of polynomials whose mahler measure has been found .",
    "the simplest formula for the mahler measure of a polynomial in more than one variable was found by smyth @xcite : @xmath8 which expresses the mahler measure as a special value of the derivative of the l - series in the character @xmath9 , the nontrivial dirichlet character of conductor 3 .",
    "later boyd and rodriguez villegas @xcite studied the polynomials @xmath10 .",
    "they found that when @xmath11 and @xmath12 are cyclotomic , @xmath13 can be expressed as a sum of values of the bloch  wigner dilogarithm at certain algebraic arguments .",
    "the bloch  wigner dilogarithm is defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 for @xmath16 is the classical dilogarithm .",
    "@xmath17 can be extended as a real analytic function in @xmath18 and continuous in @xmath19 .",
    "let us point out that @xmath20 @xmath21 an account of the properties of the bloch  wigner dilogarithm can be found in zagier s work @xcite .",
    "one of these amazing properties is that @xmath17 is equal to the volume of the ideal hyperbolic tetrahedron of shape @xmath22 , with @xmath23 ( denoted by @xmath24 ) . in other words , a tetrahedron in @xmath1",
    "whose vertices are @xmath25 ( and in particular they belong to @xmath26 ) .",
    "see milnor @xcite , and zagier @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of a relation between mahler measure and dilogarithm ( and hence hyperbolic volumes ) is given by cassaigne and maillot , @xcite : for @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the statement that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the lengths of the sides of a triangle , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the angles opposite to the sides of lengths @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "see figure [ maillot ] .",
    "we see that the dilogarithm term in this formula corresponds to the volume of the ideal tetrahedron that can be built over the triangle of sides @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    [ maillot ]",
    "another example was considered by vandervelde @xcite .",
    "he studied the mahler measure of @xmath36 and found a formula , which in the case of @xmath37 , is very similar to the formula above .",
    "the mahler measure ( in the nontrivial case ) turns out to be the sum of some logarithmic terms and two values of the dilogarithm , which can be interpreted as the hyperbolic volume of an ideal polyhedron that is built over a cyclic quadrilateral .",

    "we have studied the mahler measure of @xmath41 whose zero set is described by the rational function @xmath42 we find that the mahler measure of the polynomial @xmath43 has to do with volumes of ideal polyhedra built over polygons with @xmath7 sides of length 1 and @xmath44 sides of length @xmath45 .",
    "in fact ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and the @xmath48 are all the admissible polygons of type @xmath49 .    here @xmath50 is the polynomial ( [ poly ] ) and admissible polygons are , roughly speaking , all the possible cyclic polygons that can be built with @xmath7 sides of length 1 and @xmath44 sides of length @xmath45",
    ". we will give a precise definition later .    this formula with hyperbolic volumes",
    "is similar to certain formulas that occur for some cases of the @xmath3-polynomial of one - cusped manifolds .",
    "this situation was studied by boyd @xcite , @xcite , and boyd and rodriguez villegas @xcite .",
    "we have divided this paper as follows . in section 2",
    "we compute the mahler measure of the family of polynomials @xmath51 . in section 3",

    "* this proposition is very similar to proposition 1 in @xcite ( when @xmath59 ) , but we prove it here so we can provide more details .",
    "we may suppose that @xmath60 , since multiplication of @xmath61 by numbers of absolute value 1 does not affect the mahler measure ( an easy property that can be deduced from the definition of mahler measure ) .",

    "the extreme points of the @xmath65 must be roots of @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to see that we only need to consider the roots of odd multiplicity , indeed , @xmath68 crosses the unit circle only on those roots .",
    "see figure [ f : prop ] .",
    "are the sets where @xmath69 .",
    "the extremes of these arcs occur in points where @xmath61 crosses the unit circle . ]",
    "it is also clear that for each root of @xmath67 , its inverse is also a root ( in other words , @xmath70 is reciprocal ) , so the roots with absolute value one come in conjugated pairs , except , maybe , for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we need to analyze what happens with these two cases .",
    "case @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath44 and @xmath7 are coprime , they can not be even at the same time and the only meaningful case in which @xmath72 may be a root is when both are odd . in that case ,",
    "@xmath73 , and @xmath59 .",
    "studying the multiplicity of @xmath72 in this case is equivalent to studying the multiplicity of @xmath72 as a root of @xmath74 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , hence @xmath72 is a root of multiplicity two .",
    "case @xmath71 .",
    "we have @xmath77 .",
    "hence @xmath71 is root of @xmath67 if and only if @xmath78 .",
    "as before , it is enough to study the parity of the multiplicity of @xmath71 as a root of @xmath79 .",
    "again we see that @xmath80 but @xmath81 .",
    "hence @xmath71 is a root of even multiplicity .",
    "thus we do not need to take @xmath71 or @xmath72 into account and the extremes of the @xmath65 will lie in the @xmath82 and their conjugates .",
    "we have @xmath83 by equation([eq : prop2d ] ) . using this in formula ( [ eq : prop ] ) , and with the previous observations about the roots of @xmath70",
    ", we obtain formula ( [ eq : prop1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath84    there is another way of performing this computation , which was suggested by rodriguez villegas .",
    "the idea is to start with the case of @xmath59 and obtain the general case as a deformation .    in order to do this ,",
    "let us compute the initial case is a slightly different way . recall that @xmath85 following @xcite , let @xmath86 be the smooth projective completion of the complex zero locus of @xmath87 and let @xmath88 the set of points where either @xmath89 or @xmath61 have a zero or a pole .",
    "consider the following differential 1-form in @xmath90 : @xmath91 observe that @xmath92 where @xmath93 is , as before , the set in the unit circle where @xmath69 .",
    "because of jensen s formula , the identity above is true for any polynomial in two variables such that the `` coefficient '' of the highest power of @xmath61 ( a polynomial in @xmath89 ) has mahler measure zero ( i.e. , product of cyclotomic polynomials and powers of @xmath89 ) .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath94 is closed .",
    "when the polynomial is tempered ( see @xcite ) @xmath94 extends to the whole @xmath86 .",
    "if in addition @xmath95 in @xmath96 , then the form is exact and in fact , @xmath97 the above conditions are easily verified by @xmath87 . using the above equation",
    ", we recover the statement for @xmath59 : @xmath98    now in order to treat the general case , we write @xmath99 and @xmath100 then if @xmath101 where @xmath93 , we also have @xmath102 where @xmath103 . now @xmath35 is the set of the circle where @xmath104 , i.e. , where @xmath105 .",
    "see figure [ f : fer ] .",
    "are the sets where @xmath69 , the arcs @xmath106 are the sets where @xmath105 . ]    observe that @xmath107 then    @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath84    the moral of this last procedure is that we can compute the mahler measure of the polynomial with general coefficient @xmath2 by altering the mahler measure of the polynomial with @xmath59 .",
    "this concept of smooth deformation will appear in the main result of this paper , when we interpret this formula as volumes in hyperbolic space .",
    "we see that in order to compute the general mahler measure , we need to integrate in a different path , i.e. , in the set where @xmath105 .",
    "there is no reason to think that this integration is harder to perform than the one over the set @xmath69 .",
    "however , determining the new arcs @xmath35 as functions of @xmath2 might be hard .",
    "nevertheless , this method should be useful to compute other examples , but we will not go on into this direction in this paper .    in general , it seems difficult to interpret the intersection points ( i.e. , the starting and ending points for the arcs @xmath35 ) geometrically .",
    "the main point of this paper is to show such an interpretation for the particular example that we have studied .",
    "we will need some notation .",
    "the following definition is not standard .",
    "a cyclic plane polygon @xmath110 will be called admissible of type @xmath49 if the following conditions are true :    * @xmath110 has @xmath111 sides , @xmath44 of length @xmath2 ( with @xmath60 ) and @xmath7 of length 1 . *",
    "all the sides of length @xmath2 wind around the center of the circle in the same direction , ( say counterclockwise ) , and all the sides of length 1 wind around the center of the circle in the same direction , which may be opposite from the direction of the sides of length @xmath2 ( so they all wind counterclockwise or clockwise ) .    in order to build such a polygon @xmath110",
    ", we need to define two angles , @xmath94 and @xmath112 , which are the central angles subtended by the chords of lengths @xmath71 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "see figure [ thm1 ] .",
    "the polygon does not need to be convex or to wind exactly once around the center of the circle .",
    "figure [ thm1].a shows an ordinary convex polygon winding once .",
    "observe that in this picture the two families of sides wind in the same direction . in figure",
    "[ thm1].b , the polygon does not wind around the center . in this picture",
    "the two families of sides wind in opposite directions .",
    "let us remark that there are finitely many admissible polygons for given @xmath44 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 . given a polygon , the radius of the circle is fixed .",
    "conversely , for each radius , there is at most one admissible polygon of type @xmath49 that can be inscribed in the circle for @xmath2 fixed .",
    "it is easy to see that the radius @xmath113 and the parameter @xmath2 satisfy an algebraic equation .",
    "so for given @xmath2 there are only finitely many solutions @xmath113 .    , which are opposite to angles measuring @xmath112 .",
    "the ordinary segments indicate sides of length @xmath71 , opposite to angles measuring @xmath94 .",
    "the circles in the pictures may seem to have the same radius , but that is not true .",
    "the radius is determined by the size polygon that is inscribed in the circle . ]",
    "given an admissible polygon @xmath110 , we think of @xmath114 , then @xmath115 denotes the ideal polyhedron whose vertices are @xmath116 and those of @xmath110 ( see figure [ f : thm ] ) .",
    "we use the model @xmath117 for the hyperbolic space .",
    "now , it makes sense to speak of the hyperbolic volume @xmath118 ( up to a sign ) .",
    "we consider @xmath110 to be subdivided into @xmath111 triangles , as can be seen in figure [ thm1 ] , all of the triangles sharing a vertex at the center of the circle , and the opposite side to this vertex being one of the @xmath111 chords .",
    "hence we get @xmath44 isosceles triangles of basis @xmath2 and @xmath7 isosceles triangles of basis @xmath71 .",
    "we consider the orthoschemes over each of these triangles and the total volume will be the sum of the volumes of these tetrahedra , but we take the tetrahedra over the sides of length @xmath2 to be negatively oriented if the two families of sides wind in opposite directions .",
    "compare with the definition of dilogarithm of an oriented cyclic quadrilateral given by vandervelde , @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to state our main result .",
    "[ theo ] the dilogarithm term of the mahler measure in formula ( [ eq : prop1 ] ) is equal to the sum of the volumes of certain ideal polyhedra in the hyperbolic space @xmath1 : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and the @xmath48 are all the admissible polygons of type @xmath49 .    * proof . *",
    "first , we will see that for each @xmath121 , there exists an admissible polygon @xmath110 as in the statement such that @xmath122    suppose @xmath123 is such that @xmath124    \\bigcap   \\left(\\frac{l \\pi}{n } , \\frac{(l+1 ) \\pi}{n } \\right ]   \\qquad 0 \\leq k < m , \\quad   0 \\leq l < n\\ ] ]    we choose @xmath94 and @xmath112 according to the rules given by the following tables :    cc    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     ( @xmath125 ) & @xmath126 +    we can see that we get different kinds of stars , and that all the sides wind around the center of the circle in the same direction for the @xmath127 and that the two families of sides wind in different directions for the @xmath128 . for this simple relation to hold ,",

    "boyd @xcite , @xcite and boyd and rodriguez villegas @xcite found several examples where the mahler measure of the @xmath3-polynomial of a compact , orientable , complete , one - cusped , hyperbolic manifold @xmath130 is related to the volume of the manifold .",

    "consider the case of @xmath59 .",
    "then the terms with @xmath133 vanish and formulas ( [ eq : prop1 ] ) and ( [ eq : thm ] ) become @xmath134    let us first mention a few words about @xmath3-polynomials .",
    "the @xmath3-polynomial is a certain invariant from the space of representations @xmath135 , more precisely , it is the minimal , nontrivial algebraic relation between two parameters @xmath89 and @xmath61 which have to do with @xmath136 and @xmath137 , where @xmath138 are the longitude and the meridian of the boundary torus . for details about this definition",
    "see for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "assume the manifold @xmath130 can be decomposed as a finite union of ideal tetrahedra : @xmath139 then @xmath140    for this collection of tetrahedra to be a triangulation of @xmath130 , their parameters must satisfy certain equations , which may be classified in two groups :    * _",
    "gluing equations_. these reflect the fact that the tetrahedra all fit well around each edge of the triangulation : @xmath141 where @xmath142 , @xmath143 are some integers depending on @xmath130 . * _ completeness equations_. these have to do with the triangulation fitting properly at the cusps .",
    "if there is one cusp , there will be two of them : + @xmath144 + where @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 are some integers depending on @xmath130 .",
    "one possible solution to this system of equations is the geometric solution , when all the @xmath149 .",
    "there are other possible solutions . for the geometric solution ,",
    "@xmath150 is the volume of @xmath130 . following boyd @xcite",
    ", @xmath150 will be called a pseudovolume of @xmath130 for the other solutions .",
    "hence , pseudovolumes correspond to sums where at least one of the terms is the dilogarithm of a number @xmath22 with @xmath151 . one way to understand this is that some of the tetrahedra may be degenerate ( when @xmath152 ) or negatively oriented ( when @xmath153 ) .",
    "boyd shows some examples where @xmath154 where @xmath155 and the other @xmath156 are pseudovolumes . at this point ,",
    "the analogy of our situation with boyd s results should be clear .",
    "we would like to say that @xmath87 is some sort of @xmath3-polynomial for some hyperbolic object .",
    "back to the construction of the @xmath3-polynomial , introduce `` deformation parameters '' @xmath89 and @xmath61 and replace the completeness relations by    @xmath157    for our purposes , the @xmath3-polynomial is obtained by eliminating @xmath158 from the system formed by the gluing equations ( [ eq : glue ] ) and the equations ( [ eq : l ] ) and ( [ eq : m ] ) .",
    "this construction is slightly different form the original definition , since it parameterizes representations in @xmath159 instead of @xmath160 . for a detailed discussion about the relationship between this definition and the original one ,",
    "we refer the reader to champanerkar s thesis @xcite .",
    "see also dunfield s appendix to @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we form the matrix @xmath161    one of the main results in @xcite is    ( neumann  zagier)[thm : nz ] @xmath162 where @xmath163    back to our problem , we recall that each term in the right side of equation ( [ eq : a ] ) corresponds to the volume of an orthoscheme that is built over an admissible polygon . each of these polygons is naturally divided into @xmath111 triangles .",
    "this division yields a division of the corresponding orthoscheme in @xmath111 hyperbolic tetrahedra .",
    "these tetrahedra are not ideal .",
    "however , we can redo the whole process by pushing this common vertex that lies over the center of the circle to the base plane @xmath164 and all the tetrahedra become ideal .",
    "the new orthoscheme will be denoted by @xmath165 .",
    "the volumes of the tetrahedra get multiplied by 2 . formula ( [ eq : a ] ) becomes    @xmath166    inspired by the above situation , it is natural for us to take these tetrahedra as a triangulation for our hyperbolic object .",
    "so we would like to choose the shape parameters to be @xmath167 and @xmath168 . here",
    "we actually mean that we have @xmath169 tetrahedra , @xmath44 of them have parameter @xmath170 and @xmath7 of them have parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we choose the parameters to be @xmath171 and @xmath172 and impose the additional condition that @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the fact that the tetrahedra wind around the axis through the center of the circle which is orthogonal to the base plane @xmath164 , can be expressed by the gluing equation @xmath175 .",
    "further , we need two additional completeness equations , which will be chosen ad hoc for the final result to fit our needs .    it is easy to see that the system @xmath176 for @xmath177 , satisfies the conditions of theorem [ thm : nz ] .",
    "the system reduces easily to    @xmath178    replace the first equation by its @xmath179th - power ,    @xmath180    eliminate @xmath89 and @xmath61 .",
    "one of the branches ( the one with @xmath181 ) , is @xmath182 consider @xmath183 ( we have chosen a particular branch again ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath184 hence @xmath185    we can think of @xmath186 as the @xmath3-polynomial of some hyperbolic object that has a triangulation that can be described by the system of equations ( [ eq : tri ] ) .",
    "we do not expect this object to be a manifold .",
    "for instance , this object can not be the complement of a knot , since the @xmath3-polynomial of a knot has a number of properties such as being reciprocal ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    also note that the objects whose volumes we are adding , correspond to solutions of the system of equations ( [ eq : tri3 ] ) with @xmath187 , in other words , we are able to recover the @xmath82 for the case of @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , we need to solve the system @xmath188 from the third equation we write @xmath189 , @xmath190 . substituting this into the first equation",
    ", we see that @xmath191 . from this",
    "we conclude that @xmath192 .",
    "now look at the second equation , which says that @xmath193 if we take into account that @xmath192 , we see that we are actually computing the @xmath194  power of an absolute value , then @xmath195 concluding that the only possible solutions are @xmath111 and @xmath196 - roots of unity is now an easy exercise .    note that we generally get more than one `` geometric solution '' , in the sense that there is more than one solution where all the parameters lie in @xmath197 .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath198 , we get the two solutions described in the example . in the case of @xmath199 , we get two `` geometric solutions '' and one that corresponds to @xmath200 with @xmath59 ( the triangle in figure [ polygon_exb3].b ) which is not `` geometric '' since @xmath112 must be taken to wind in the opposite direction ( which is equivalent to @xmath201 ) .",
    "let us also observe that , if @xmath86 is the smooth projective completion of the curve defined by @xmath202 , then @xmath203 in @xmath204 .",

    "finally , we should point out that we could have done the whole process starting from the family of polynomials @xmath211 .",
    "the reason we started with the polynomials @xmath212 is that they are easier to analyze and that they seem a natural choice in order to generalize previous works as it is explained in the introduction .",
    "to conclude , let us mention that it would be interesting to generalize these examples to cases involving @xmath213 parameters @xmath214 instead of just one parameter . in these general examples we would have to consider admisible polygons with some sides of length @xmath215 , some sides of length @xmath216 and so on , thus generalizing completely the examples considered by cassaigne  maillot and vandervelde .",
