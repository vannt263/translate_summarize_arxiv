    "the shapes of the observed seds of nls1s seem like that of flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , and the contributions of inverse compton ( ic ) by the external field photons from their broad line regions ( blrs ) need to be considered . the radiation from a blr is assumed to be a blackbody spectrum and the corresponding energy densities seen in the comoving frame are simply assumed as @xmath5 erg @xmath6 ( ( * ? ? ?",
