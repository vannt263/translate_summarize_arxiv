    "the casimir effect is one of the most interesting macroscopic manifestations of the nontrivial structure of the vacuum state in quantum field theory .",
    "the effect is a phenomenon common to all systems characterized by fluctuating quantities and results from changes in the vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field that occur because of the imposition of boundary conditions or the choice of topology .",
    "it may have important implications on all scales , from cosmological to subnuclear , and has become in recent decades an increasingly popular topic in quantum field theory .",
    "in addition to its fundamental interest the casimir effect also plays an important role in the fabrication and operation of nano- and micro - scale mechanical systems .",
    "the imposition of boundary conditions on a quantum field leads to the modification of the spectrum for the zero - point fluctuations and results in the shift in the vacuum expectation values for physical quantities such as the energy density and stresses .",
    "in particular , the confinement of quantum fluctuations causes forces that act on constraining boundaries .",
    "the particular features of the resulting vacuum forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold , the boundary geometries and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field . since the original work by casimir casi48 many theoretical and experimental works",

    "an interesting property of the casimir effect has always been the geometry dependence .",

    "this provides a possibility for the stabilization of the radii by vacuum forces .",
    "however , it should be noted that for the reliable predictions regarding quantum stabilization , the renormalized single shell parts also should be taken into account . in section [ sec : toten ] we consider the total vacuum energy in the region between the cylindrical surfaces , evaluated as the sum of the zero - point energies for elementary oscillators . it is argued that this energy differs from the energy , obtained by the integration of the volume energy density over the region between the boundaries .",
