    "the extreme luminosity and relatively low space density of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) might be taken to imply that they constitute an unusual subset of all galaxies , and that the study of agn gives us a lopsided view of cosmological processes .",
    "on the contrary , recent findings indicate that activity on the small scales surrounding the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and its accretion disk may have a significant bearing on the agn s environment on galactic scales or even larger , playing an important role in the evolution of the host galaxy and the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "the ubiquity of smbhs within galactic nuclei suggests that a phase of agn activity is the rule rather than the exception .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of a correlation between the mass of the smbh and the velocity dispersion of stars in the bulge of the host ( ferrarese & merritt , 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) hints that the evolution of each component smbh and stars must , at some level , be linked .",
    "feedback from the agn itself has been suggested as one mechanism by which the @xmath2 relation could be established ( silk & rees , 1998 ; fabian , 1999 ; granato et al .",
    "2004 ) , wherein outflows from an agn - driven wind can unbind gas from the host galaxy , halting star formation and further black hole growth .",
    "the effect of agn feedback ( in the form of jets or of accretion disk winds ) on the evolution of the host galaxy has also been posited as a solution to the mismatch between @xmath3cdm hierarchical galaxy formation models and observed galaxy luminosity functions ( e.g. benson et al .",
    "the study of the evolution of agn , their host galaxies and their outflows , is therefore of great significance to cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "evidence for outflows is found in about 15 percent ( reichard et al . , 2003 ) of luminous ,",
    "optically selected quasars , in the form of broad absorption lines ( bals ) .",
    "bals , characteristically in the c iv ( 1549 ) line , exhibit broad absorption troughs with high blueshifts , pointing to an origin in high velocity ( @xmath40.1c ) , radiation - driven outflows .",
    "broadly speaking , three scenarios have been proposed to account for the bal effect in quasars : ( 1 ) balqs form a distinct class of agn in their own right ( disfavoured by the observed similarity between balq and non - balq optical / uv continua and emission lines : weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) ( 2 ) bal winds are a generic feature of _ all _ agn , but an orientation dependence restricts the visibility of lines to only @xmath41020 percent of the population ( weymann et al . , 1991 ; murray et al .",
    "1995 ) ( 3 ) the bal phenomenon represents a short - lived phase in the life - cycle of every agn , during which the active nucleus is still enshrouded by gas and dust which covers a large fraction of the sky ( hazard et al . 1984 ; voit , weymann & korista , 1993 ) .",
    "either of the latter two interpretations ( characterised by becker et al .",
    "2000 as `` unification by orientation '' as opposed to `` unification by time '' ) would have important implications for understanding the nature and evolution of agn , and their relationship with their host galaxies .",
    "observations in the submillimetre ( submm ) band have opened an important window on the formation of massive galaxies ( for a small cross - section of the work in this area , see e.g. smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; scott et al . 2002 ; borys et al . 2003 ; mortier et al . 2005 ) .",
    "models of the coevolution of smbhs and spheroids ( e.g. granato et al .",
    "2004 ) predict that a substantial portion of the star formation within the hosts of luminous agn ought to take place in a dust - enshrouded , submm - luminous mode ; there could therefore be a direct link between the population of high - redshift submm galaxies and agn .",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations of fields surveyed by the submm common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) indicate that agn are present in a high fraction of submm galaxies , even when their bolometric luminosity is dominated by a starburst ( alexander et al . 2005 ) , consistent with a smbh gradually growing within a massive , star - forming galaxy .",
    "it could be , then , that submm galaxies and quasars represent similar populations observed at different points during their life cycle . within this scenario",
    ", it has been speculated that balqs or some subclass of balqs such as _ low ionization bal quasars _ ( lobals : balqs that exhibit absorption in lines such as mg ii in addition to the usual c iv) represent a youthful transitionary phase during which the agn , initially embedded within a region of high star formation , expels its obscuring shroud of gas and dust ( voit , weymann & korista , 1993 ) and emerges to become a classical , optically selected quasar , as in the evolutionary scheme of sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .    to seek observational evidence of star formation - powered submm emission in high - redshift agn ,",
    "we and other groups have carried out a sequence of surveys of optically selected quasars at submm / mm wavelengths ( e.g. radio - quiet quasars at @xmath52 : priddey et al .",
    "2003a and omont et al .",
    "2003 ; at @xmath6 : carilli et al .",

    "2001 , isaak et al . 2002 ; and @xmath7 : priddey et al . 2003b ; petric et al . 2003 ; robson et al .",
    "a handful of balqs were incidentally observed during these studies , exhibiting marginally higher detection rates compared with non - bal quasars .",
    "in addition , a number of the most spectacular high - redshift submm sources were also known to be balqs : for example , the lensed @xmath8=2.55 ( low ionization ) bal quasar h1413 + 117 known as the `` cloverleaf '' ( hughes et al . 1997 for submm data ) , or the luminous , lensed @xmath8=3.91 quasar apm08279 + 5255 ( lewis et al .",
    "the implied link between bals and large submm luminosity ( hence possibly star formation ) could , if verified , provide support for the evolutionary , `` unification by time '' model , but the sample sizes were inadequate to confirm or refute this suggestion with statistical confidence .    here",
    "we present a study of a sample of bal quasars undertaken with the scuba submm bolometer array on the jcmt .",
    "as described below ( section 2.1 ) , the sample has been selected to facilitate comparison with the benchmark sample of optically luminous , @xmath9 quasars observed by priddey et al",
    ". 2003a ( hereafter p03 ) .",
    "explicitly , we wish to test the null hypothesis that the submm properties of balqs and non - bal quasars are identical ( strictly , in this instance , that balqs and non - bals quasars have the same 850@xmath0 m flux distribution ) . ancillary goals of this work are : to determine accurately the typical submm properties of a well - selected , widely studied sample of bal quasars , to establish the submm contribution to their broadband seds , and to search for dependence of submm flux on other observed properties .",
    "our parent sample is derived from the catalogue of balqs in the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs : hewett et al .",
    "1995 ) identified by weymann et al .",
    "this is a well suited sample for a number of reasons .",
    "the lbqs is a homogeneous , rigorously selected survey , and the balq subset has formed the target of several detailed , multiwavelength studies ( e.g. optical : weymann et al .",
    "1991 , x - ray ( _ chandra _ ) : gallagher et al . 2006a",
    "; mid - infrared ( _ spitzer _ ) : gallagher et al .",
    "also , the sample is well matched , in optical luminosity and redshift , to the scuba bright quasar survey ( sbqs ) @xmath8=2 sample ( p03 ) .",
    "the lbqs was one of the sources for the @xmath8=2 sbqs ; note that all the balqs in our sample meet the sbqs selection criteria .",
    "( indeed , some of them were incidentally observed during that project , but will be removed from the p03 sample for the purposes of defining a non - bal quasar comparison sample . ) the correspondence in ( @xmath8,@xmath10 ) between the two samples is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "absolute @xmath11 band magnitudes ( @xmath10 ) for the balqs were extrapolated ( assuming a spectral index @xmath120.5 ) from measurements of the monochromatic continuum flux at rest wavelength @xmath132000  measured by weymann et al .",
    "the definition of the original scuba ( non - bal ) quasar surveys ( optical luminosity criterion @xmath14 ) ( mcmahon et al . 1999 , isaak et al . 2002 ) employed an einstein  de sitter cosmology with @xmath15=0 , @xmath16=1 , @xmath17=50 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "however , in figure 1 and table 1 , we have transformed @xmath10 into a flat cosmology with @xmath15=0.73 and @xmath17=70 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the equivalent selection criterion is shown as the dotted curve . over the redshift range @xmath19 , the offset between the cosmologies is small ( indeed , their distance moduli are equal at @xmath20 ) .",

    "( 1992 ) , who report 5ghz fluxes / upper limits for the majority of the sample .",
    "1.4ghz fluxes for the remainder were obtained from the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres : white et al . ,",
    "1997 ) and nvss ( nrao vla sky survey : condon et al . 1998 ) catalogues .",
    "only one object , lbqs b2211@xmath121915 has a nearby ( 1.5 arcsec ) radio source , with a 1.4ghz flux of 64mjy .",
    "however , this quasar was not detected at 850@xmath0 m so its radio - loudness does not affect our analysis .",
    "for the remainder , the radio upper limits predict a negligible ( @xmath210.1mjy ) synchrotron component when extrapolated to the submm ( e.g. using a spectral index of @xmath120.7 , as in mcmahon et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the final selection of observed sources was determined by largely uncontrollable factors such as telescope scheduling , etc .    in previous scuba surveys of high - redshift quasars",
    ", we adopted a two - pronged strategy .",
    "for example in mcmahon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , a small @xmath6 sample was observed to a sensitive rms @xmath1311.5mjy in order to establish accurately the 850 and 450@xmath0 m properties of high - redshift quasars .",

    "( 2002 ) and p03 ( sbqs ) pursued the complementary course of observing larger samples ( @xmath1340 and 60 respectively ) to a shallower limit , 1@xmath223mjy , with the primary aim of sifting out the bright detections as targets for future follow - up .",
    "since , however , the detection fraction at the limit of the sbqs was only @xmath425 percent , the `` typical '' submm flux of the majority of @xmath8=2 quasars is clearly much fainter than this limit .",
    "the aims of the present balq programme ( measure characteristic flux of balqs , and precision photometry to constrain seds ) thus require high sensitivity , and so an rms of 1.5mjy at 850@xmath0 m was adopted . in parallel with , and complementary",
    "to , the survey of p03 , a set of more sensitive data ( 1@xmath221mjy ) was also obtained for a small number ( 5 ) of ( non - bal ) @xmath8=2 targets .",

    "scuba experienced intermittent technical problems involving a 3-day warm - up cycle in the cryogen unit .",
    "a number of the observations reported in this paper were taken during this period , however the bulk of these data were obtained during a spell of stable behaviour .",
    "we have carefully inspected the affected observations nevertheless , to verify that the data appear to be of good quality .",
    "the zenith opacity was monitored constantly via the jcmt water vapour monitor ( wvm ) , and regularly through skydips .",
    "these measurements were compared with each other and with the `` tau meter '' operated by the neighbouring caltech submm observatory ( cso ) .",
    "flux calibration was carried out , where possible , against the planets uranus and mars , and when planets were not visible , by using standard secondary flux calibrators .",
    "data reduction was performed using the automated orac - dr ( jenness et al . , 2002 ) pipeline and , independently , using the surf ( jenness & lightfoot , 1998 ) package .",
    "standard procedures were followed , involving : flatfielding , correction for atmospheric extinction , sky removal and clipping at the 3@xmath24 level to remove spikes .",
    "an independent survey of the submm properties of bal quasars ( with similar scientific motivation ) was carried out by willott , rawlings & grimes ( 2003 ; hereafter wrg03 ) .",
    "their strategy was complementary to the one pursued here , aiming for a large ( 30 targets ) sample observed to a relatively shallow ( typically 2.5mjy rms ) flux limit .",
    "they found no statistically significant difference between their balq sample , and the sample of p03 .",
    "however , these two samples are not well matched , the sdss - derived sample of wrg03 lying @xmath132 magnitudes fainter in the optical than the sample of p03 ( e.g. figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , a comparison between their balq sample and the non - bal quasars sample of p03 involves making additional , poorly constrained assumptions about the relation of submm with optical luminosity .",
    "moreover , their larger observational uncertainty in principle precludes detailed study of the detected sources ( for example accurate measurement of seds ) .",
    "850@xmath0 m and 450@xmath0 m fluxes for the sample are shown in table 1 .",
    "15 balqs were observed in total , for all but one of which ( lbqs b2211@xmath121915 ) our completeness criteria were met , i.e. an 850@xmath0 m rms better than 1.5mjy or a detection better than 3@xmath24 .",
    "note that only one of the observed sample , lbqs b1231 + 1320 , is a known low - ionization bal quasar ( lobal ) ; the others are all high - ionization bal quasars ( hibals ) .",
    "this is by happenstance rather than by design , the distinction between the classes not having formed part of our selection criteria .",

    "in addition , a further three targets are tentatively detected at the 23@xmath24 level of significance .",
    "if we also include data from p03 , then the total coadded 850@xmath0 m flux density for one of these marginal sources , lbqs b0025@xmath120151 , becomes 3.8@xmath231.2mjy confirming its detection at @xmath253@xmath24 significance .",
    "note , however , that its flux lies below the formal detection limit of the complete sample , 4.5mjy ( 3@xmath24 ) , so it will not be taken into account in , for example , the detection rate estimate ( below ) .",

    "figure 2 shows the constraints placed on an isothermal dust sed parametrized by temperature and greybody index @xmath26 .",

    "the plotted model distribution does _ not _ directly represent the _ underlying _ distribution , but has been smoothed so as to represent the _ observed _ distribution that would be obtained if all observations had the same rms flux ( equal in this case to the mean rms of the sample ) .",
    "note , however , that the parameter estimation method is more subtle than this , taking full account of individual rms values ( i.e. it is not as simple as deconvolving an observed histogram with a constant rms ) .",
    "as noted above ( section 3.2 ) , we can also apply the same analysis to the benchmark @xmath8=2 quasars and to the wrg03 samples ( table 4 ) .",
    "although the datasets employ complementary strategies ( e.g. broad - but - shallow versus deep - but - narrow ) , the bayesian method takes account of the differing rms values , making it possible to combine the two balq samples within a single analysis .",

    "however , we have demonstrated ( for example by our bayesian derivation of the flux density distribution ) that @xmath8=2 quasars , bal and non - bal alike , are typically very faint in the submm ( @xmath423mjy ) .",
    "the differences between balqs and non - bal quasars , if any , presumably lie further down the luminosity function than current ( single aperture ) submm surveys , with relatively bright confusion limits , can reach .",
    "on the other hand , our tentative finding of a submm dependence on c iv ew ( a large ew seems to be a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for submm detectability , since two high ew balqs are nevertheless not detected : figure 3 ) suggests that yet more rigorous selection criteria would yield substantially higher submm detection rates compared with non - bal quasars .",
    "it is of course possible that this effect results from selection biases , for example due to reddening .",
    "the most reddened quasars must be intrinsically more luminous to meet the @xmath68 selection criterion of the lbqs .",
    "if the c iv ew were , for whatever reason , correlated with reddening , this bias could induce the apparent correlation with submm flux . nevertheless , assuming that our sample is homogeneous in terms of intrinsic luminosity , and that our submm  c iv ew relation is valid , what are its implications ?    it is well known that balqs are weaker in x - rays , relative to the optical , than non - bal quasars an effect believed to be due to absorption rather than an unusual intrinsic spectrum ( e.g. green et al .",
    "1995 ; gallagher et al .",
    "indeed , brandt , laor & wills ( 2000 ) discovered , for a sample of low - redshift ( @xmath69 ) quasars , a correlation between their c iv ew and soft x - ray weakness as measured by the optical  x - ray continuum ( 25002 kev ) spectral index ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this connection between uv and x - ray absorption does not hold so straightforwardly for @xmath9 lbqs quasars ( gallagher et al . 2006 : fig .",
    "nevertheless , if our @xmath71c iv ew connection is real , it could loosely be interpreted to advocate a link between submm activity , uv absorption and x - ray absorption .",
    "the link need not be direct , however , since the components responsible for each effect are likely to be distinct ( this could account for the findings of gallagher et al .",
    "for example , x - ray absorption is an important feature of radiation - driven wind models , in which a `` shielding gas '' component is proposed , without which the outflow would become overionized by soft x - rays , and uv resonance - line - driven radiation pressure would become ineffective .",
    "the submm - emitting region , in contrast , is likely to be much more extended , lying within for example a dust torus or the host galaxy .",
    "a possible analogy could be drawn with narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies .",
    "agn of this class are believed to result from smbhs with an accretion rate that is a high fraction of the maximal eddington - limited rate , and high velocity outflows have been observed in some ( e.g. pounds et al .",
    "it is possible that every young agn either freshly formed or recently refuelled following a merger passes through such a high - eddington state , launching an outflow , when gas supply to the nucleus is plentiful . accompanying star formation could also result from , or play an active role in ( e.g. thompson , quataert & murray , 2005 ) , the processes that drive gas into the nucleus . as the agn luminosity increases",
    "as the smbh grows , radiation pressure can generate bal outflows of sufficient magnitude to terminate both star formation and further smbh accretion .",
    "page et al .",
    "( e.g. 2004 ) found a similar submm dependence on x - ray absorption for a sample of @xmath52 quasars .",
    "in contrast with the canonical geometric unified schemes for agn ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) , this is interpreted as evidence of an evolutionary sequence , rather like the schemes outlined above , between an initial , obscured , agn  starburst phase , and a final unobscured phase , in which star formation has ceased .",
    "a bal wind could act as the transitionary mechanism between these two phases .",
    "an emerging point of view is that it is in fact the _ low - ionization _ balqs that form a class distinct from other quasars ( and from the more common hibals ) , perhaps a manifestation of youthful agn , with a high covering factor of absorbing gas and perhaps dust ( boroson & meyers , 1992 ; voit , weymann & korista , 1993 ) , and , indeed , the optical continua of lobals seem redder than those of other classes ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; reichard et al .",
    "one might expect a high detection fraction in the submm and infrared if that were the case , particularly if this youthful phase were accompanied by a starburst .",
    "the distinction between low- and high - ionization balqs did not form part of our selection criteria .",
    "the single ( known ) lobal in our sample , lbqs b1231 + 1320 , was not detected ( @xmath71=@xmath120.1@xmath231.4mjy ) .",
    "however , it would still be of interest to obtain submm / mm observations of a sample of lobals , or the third , rarer subclass known as felobals ( e.g. becker et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in contrast to a starburst power source for the dust , the submm component could derive from optical / uv agn emission reprocessed by nuclear dust . in this case , ( i ) larger c iv ew may merely be indicative of an intrinsically more luminous central engine . in support of this idea , brandt ,",
    "laor & wills ( 2000 ) found tentative evidence for a correlation between absolute visual magnitude ( @xmath72 ) and c iv ew , though scuba and mambo samples ( omont et al .",
    "2001 ; isaak et al . 2002 ; priddey et al .",
    "2003 ; omont et al .",
    "2003 ) do _ not _ show , over the limited range of optical luminosities investigated in the present balq sample , such a strong correlation between optical and submm .",
    "alternatively , ( ii ) if all agn exhibited a _ distribution _ of wind covering fractions , then those that fill a larger solid angle of the sky would be more likely both to show high far - infrared luminosity ( dust in the wind reprocesses a larger fraction of the agn s uv / optical output ) and to exhibit bal outflows ( since a greater proportion of lines of sight intersect the wind ) .",
    "comparison of the submm fluxes and limits with the full seds ( particularly x - ray and mid - infrared ) will help constrain such speculation by casting light on the starburst versus agn origin of the submm emission .",
    "but in either case , the implication of a dependence of submm flux on the properties of uv absorption lines provides support for the idea that the bal phenomenon is not a _",
    "simple _ geometric effect arising from a wind with a fixed covering fraction : since the x - ray- and uv - absorbing components are optically thin to submm radiation , the submm properties would not , _ all other factors being equal _ , be expected to depend on the observer s viewing angle relative to the wind .",
    "it is , of course , quite possible that a non - trivial combination of variables ( a range of lifetimes , covering factors and intrinsic luminosities ) must be invoked to unify the balq class within the diverse ensemble of agn types .",
    "we have observed a sample of @xmath8=2 , optically luminous broad absorption line quasars at submm wavelengths , using the scuba bolometer camera on the jcmt .",
    "our goals were twofold :    \\(i ) to test the null hypothesis @xmath73 : _ balqs and non - bal quasars have identical submm properties _    \\(ii ) to determine the 850@xmath0 m flux distribution , the submm ( 850 + 450@xmath0 m ) contribution to the seds , and the relation between submm and other properties , of a well - selected , well - studied sample of balqs .",
    "the sample was selected so as to match , in redshift and optical luminosity , the `` benchmark '' submm sample of optically luminous , radio - quiet quasars observed by priddey et al .",
    "( 2003a ) ( supplemented with a small amount of additional data presented here ) .",
    "a direct comparison between balq and non - bal quasars is thus possible .",
    "we have carried out this comparison in a number of different ways : 1 . simple non - parametric statistics such as means and medians ; 2 .",
    "survival analysis ; 3 . a bayesian method to disentangle the underlying flux distribution ( once a suitable functional form is assumed ) from the observed distribution .",
    "all these methods indicate that the submm properties of the bal and non - bal samples appear to be similar : @xmath73 can not be rejected with confidence .",
    "this conclusion is true for the luminosity - matched lbqs sample presented in this paper , as well as for the combined lbqs sample and that of wrg03 which , overall , spans a much larger range in optical luminosity .",
    "note , however , that the lbqs sample generally shows larger deviations from the benchmark than the sample of wrg03 ( though at best this effect is present at the @xmath410 percent level ) . there is , moreover , some indication that optically fainter , non - bal quasars at @xmath52 are also fainter in the submm ( priddey , isaak & mcmahon , in prep . ) . a comparison between the wrg03 sample and the optically faint @xmath8=2 sample would tentatively indicate that balqs were systematically _ brighter _ in the submm than non - bal quasars , but detailed characterisation and intercomparison of these two samples is limited by their large number of high rms , low - significance measurements .",
    "the `` typical '' 850@xmath0 m flux density of an optically luminous , @xmath8=2 balq is @xmath1323mjy ( estimated by non - parametric methods and via the bayesian fit to the flux distribution ) .",
    "thus only with very deep submm / mm observations will it be possible to detect the majority of the balq population ( when the difficulty will be encountering the confusion limit of current - generation , single - dish submm telescopes ) , and to carry out fully indicative tests of their submm properties relative to the general quasar population .",
    "some 450@xmath0 m detections / upper limits enable crude estimates of the dust temperature . for a fuller discussion of the broadband seds ( x - ray , optical , mid - infrared ) of the lbqs balq sample , see gallagher et al .",
    "( 2006a ) and gallagher et al .",
    "( 2006b ) . in principle , observations with _ spitzer _ could discriminate spectrally between nuclear ( e.g. agn torus ) and extended ( e.g. star formation in host ) dust components ( for example by fitting template seds appropriate for each component ) .",
    "finally , we find tentative evidence for a dependence of submm flux on the equivalent width of the c iv broad absorption line .",
    "although difficult to establish definitively with the present data , this finding would be easy to test by carrying out mm / submm observations of samples selected according to the ew criterion ( specifically it would predict a high detection rate above ews of @xmath1325 ) .",
    "if this finding is correct and whether the dust is heated by starburst or agn it suggests that the bal phenomenon is not a simple geometric effect arising from an orientation - dependence on a wind with a fixed covering fraction , but that other variables , such as evolutionary phase , absorber covering fraction or intrinsic luminosity , must be invoked in order to unify balqs with other classes of agn .",

    "the so - called bayesian interpretation of probability ( that probabilities are a _ subjective _ measure of the plausibility of uncertain states of affairs ) contrasts with the traditional , frequentist interpretation ( probabilities describe the relative frequencies of the outcomes of particular experiments ) . by adopting this point of view , and by using bayes theorem of conditional probabilities",
    ", one can develop a powerful method of deductive reasoning that tempers the idealised binary ( `` true '' vs. `` false '' ) certainty of classical logic , to a formalism that is better adapted to cope with the uncertainties inherent in scientific experimentation : a form of `` quantitative epistemology '' ( loredo , 1990 ) .",
    "bayesian techniques and philosophies are rapidly gaining ground in many areas of astrophysics .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the numerous reviews of the subject : see , in particular , loredo ( 1990 , 1992 ) , or an introductory statistical text such as wall & jenkins ( 2003 ) .",
    "first , we must assume a functional form for the underlying submm flux distribution . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated three common functions , each characterised by a single pair of parameters , a characteristic flux @xmath36 and a width or a slope ( @xmath38 , @xmath37 or @xmath57 ) : ( i ) a lognormal distribution @xmath74        ( the gaussian distribution is unphysical in the sense that it attributes _ negative _ luminosities to submm sources .",
    "we include it here as a diagnostic of the method . )",
    "all are normalised so to give the correct total number of observed sources .",
    "our objective is to estimate the probability distribution our subjective knowledge over the parameter pairs ( @xmath36 ; @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath57 ) , by deriving the observational outcomes of each distribution and comparing with each data point in turn .",
    "the bayesian method provides a way of updating this knowledge in the light of new data .",
    "first , for each function separately , we have to adopt a prior probability distribution over the parameters call this @xmath77 , where each model @xmath78 ( described by pairs of ( @xmath36 ; @xmath57 , @xmath38 or @xmath37 ) is denoted by the index j. in this paper , we have adopted uniform prior probability distributions , but in general one is free to take into account information from other sources in constructing the prior .",
    "next ( again , separately for each functional form ) we iteratively update the probabilities in the light of each successive data point denoted by index i ( having flux density @xmath79 and rms @xmath80 ) by applying bayes theorem :      where @xmath82 is the probability that , assuming model @xmath83 to be true , we would have measured a flux @xmath79 for the @xmath84th target in this case , given by a convolution of the underlying flux distribution ( given by @xmath83 ) with the error distribution describing the scatter of each data point ( assumed to be gaussian , with rms @xmath80 ) .",
    "the denominator acts as a normalising factor .",
    "@xmath85 now replaces @xmath77 as our estimate of the probability function over the parameters .",
    "we iterate the procedure with the next data point , using this new estimate of @xmath77 on the right hand side , and repeat until all data points have been taken into account .",
    "note that for this purpose , all data are taken at face value , regardless of significance : their measurement error is taken into account in estimating @xmath82 , alleviating the need to draw a sharp distinction between detection and non - detection .",
    "if we are interested in the value of one parameter in particular such as the characteristic flux , @xmath36 we can use the technique of _ bayesian marginalization _ to integrate the final joint probability distribution ( @xmath86 ) with respect to the remaining parameters ( dubbed `` nuisance parameters '' in bayesian analysis ) .",
    "the resulting marginal distribution ( @xmath87 ) is the probability density function describing our subjective knowledge concerning the true value of the parameter ( @xmath36 ) .",
    ", this marginal distribution e.g. top right panel of figure 4 should _ not _ be confused with the `` best guess '' flux distribution ( e.g. bottom panels of figure 4 ) obtained by inserting the most likely values of the parameters into the function .",
    "the former is a measure of our subjective knowledge ( or ignorance ) , the latter our best estimate of the real , objective distribution exhibited by the sample . )",
    "the strength of the bayesian approach is that we can take into account _ all _ the data , without making any distinction between `` detection '' and `` non - detection '' .",
    "this is particularly useful for treating low signal - to - noise data , for combining datasets which have a wide range of errors , or non - gaussian errors , or which suffer from different observational biases ( such bias could in principle be taken into account in estimating @xmath82 for each data point ) .",
    "its weakness is its reliance upon our making an assumption about the functional form of the underlying distribution ( the final @xmath88 is , strictly , a _ conditional _",
    "probability , the probability of the parameters taking particular values assuming the underlying form of the distribution to be true ) .",
    "this assumption may , in general , be motivated by a particular physical model , if independent evidence makes the model _ a priori _ more likely .",
    "for the present purposes , it is sufficient that the fit provide an adequate phenomological description of the data , in order that the key quantities can be estimated ."
