    "of the billion neutron stars in the galaxy , we shall be mainly concerned with the evolution of two distinct populations : the millisecond pulsars and the isolated neutron stars both aging , the first in low mass binaries , the second as field stars moving in the interstellar medium of our milky way .",
    "we will show that the interaction with their surroundings may profoundly alter their spin and magnetic field .",
    "the extent of these changes and the modes vary in the two scenarios .",
    "it is in exploring this diversity that we wish to infer the nature of the equation of state and to provide a unified view of field decay . in particular ,",
    "the existence of `` unconventional '' sources , such as _ sub - millisecond pulsars _ , stars rotating close to their break up limit , and as _ solitary neutron stars accreting the interstellar medium , _ is a crucial test for our studies .",

    "we trace the evolution of a neutron star in the ejector , propeller and accretion phases , described briefly using simple background arguments .",
    "section 3 surveys the physical models for the evolution of the magnetic field both in isolated and accreting systems . in section 4 we explore possible individual pathways that may lead to the formation , in low mass binaries , of neutron stars spinning very close to their mass shedding threshold , a limit sensitive to the equation of state for nuclear matter",
    ". pathways of isolated neutron stars follow .",
    "the first four sections set the general background used to construct , in sections 5 and 6 , statistical models aimed at determining the presence and abundance of sub - millisecond pulsars in the galaxy , and of solitary neutron stars shining in the x - rays .",
    "specifically , in section 5 we explore , within the recycling scenario , the star s spin and magnetic evolution using physical models and the role played by disc instabilities in affecting the latest phases of binary evolution toward the ejector state of sub - millisecond pulsars . in section 6",
    "we carry out the first stellar census .",
    "we then establish how elusive neutron stars can be as accreting sources from the interstellar medium due to their large velocities and to magnetic field decay .",
    "over the stellar lifetime , magnetic and hydrodynamic torques acting on the neutron star ( ns hereafter ) induce secular changes in its spin rate .",
    "four physical parameters determine the extent of the torques : the magnetic field strength @xmath0 the rotational period @xmath1 the density of the surrounding ( interstellar ) medium @xmath2 and the rate of mass inflow @xmath3 toward the ns . according to the magnitude of these quantities , a ns experiences three different evolutionary paths : ejector ( @xmath4 ) , propeller ( @xmath5 ) , and accretion ( @xmath6 ) @xcite . in phase",

    "the outflowing pulsar momentum flux is unable to balance the ram pressure of the gravitationally captured matter at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "matter initiates its infall and approaches the _ magnetospheric radius _ ( or alfven radius )    @xmath26    here the magnetic pressure of the dipolar stellar field ( @xmath27 ) balances the ram pressure of the infalling material ( @xmath28 ) , accreting at a rate @xmath3 . at @xmath29",
    "the steeply rising magnetic field would thread the flow , enforcing it to corotation .",
    "however , not always can matter pass this edge : penetration is prevented whenever the rotational speed @xmath30 of the uniformly rotating magnetosphere exceeds the local keplerian velocity @xmath31 ( @xmath32^{1/2}$ ] ) at @xmath33 this condition translates into a comparison between the _ corotation radius _    @xmath34    and @xmath29 . when @xmath35 lies inside @xmath29 the magnetosphere centrifugally lifts the plasma above its escape velocity , inhibiting its further infall toward the ns surface : this is the propeller phase @xmath5 .",

    "the effectiveness of the propeller in spinning down the ns and in ejecting matter far out from the magnetosphere is still largely model dependent @xcite .",
    "recently , evidence that this mechanism is at work in binaries of high @xcite and low mass @xcite has come from x - ray observations .",
    "phase @xmath5 terminates only when the corotation radius @xmath35 increases above @xmath29 ; thereon the ns is able to accept matter directly onto its surface : this is the accretion phase @xmath6 .",

    "the first term in the rhs of equation ( [ accspin ] ) describes the advection of angular momentum by accretion .",
    "magnetic torques are instead non - local , resulting from an integral that extends over the whole disc : different regions can give either positive ( spin - up ) or negative contributions ( spin - down ) .",
    "when @xmath51 the integrand in ( [ accspin ] ) is negative yielding a spin - down magnetic torque . on the other hand ,",
    "if the star rotates very slowly ( @xmath52 ) the overall magnetic torque is positive , leading to a secular spin - up : when the total torque is positive the spin - up process is termed _",
    "recycling_. at a critical ( intermediate ) value of @xmath30 , termed _ equilibrium angular velocity _",
    "@xmath53 , the magnetic torque is negative , and its value exactly offsets the ( positive ) advective torque . in this regime",
    "the ns accretes matter from the disc without exchanging angular momentum at all .",
    "the precise value of @xmath53 is rather uncertain , but it ought to lie between @xmath54 times the critical frequency @xmath55 in the mid of the propeller and accretor regimes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "there is a narrow range for @xmath30 between @xmath53 and @xmath56 within which the ns accretes mass but spins down .",
    "once the star has reached its equilibrium period @xmath57 , further changes in the spin period @xmath12 are possible only if the magnetic field and/or @xmath37 vary .",
    "generally , field decay causes the star to slide along the so called _ spin - up line _ where the period @xmath12 takes the value @xmath58 at the current values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 a large increase in the mass transfer rate can induce further spin - up since the magnetosphere at @xmath29 is squeezed in a region of higher keplerian velocity . a decrease in @xmath37",
    "has the opposite effect and if there is a decline in the mass transfer rate ( due to disc instabilities and/or perturbations in the atmosphere of the donor star ) , the ns can transit from @xmath61 . the critical period for the last transition does not coincide with equation ( [ ep ] ) , but occurs when the alfven radius @xmath29 ( function of the mass transfer rate @xmath3 ) exceeds the light cylinder radius @xmath62 ( eqs .",
    "[ lcyl ] and [ alf ] ) , i.e. , when @xmath63 ( note that this transition is not symmetric relative to @xmath64 ) . over the stellar lifetime , nss can trace loops moving through the various phases ( @xmath65 or / and @xmath66 ) .",
    "it may happen that @xmath29 increases above @xmath25 when @xmath37 is very low ( as in the ism ) : in this case the star is in the so called georotator state ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the major drivers of the ns evolution are magnetic field decay ( though amplification is an interesting possibility ) and variations in the mass transfer rate : their study is thus the subject of @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "in the @xmath59 versus @xmath12 diagram of pulsars ( psrs ) we clearly find nss endowed with intense magnetic fields ( the canonical pulsars ) and nss with a much lower magnetic moment , the `` millisecond '' pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "the first are isolated objects and largely outnumber the millisecond pulsars often living in binaries with degenerate companion stars .",
    "the origin of this observational dichotomy seems understood but the physical mechanisms driving the field evolution remain still uncertain .",
    "we review here current ideas for the evolution of the @xmath70 field .",
    "they are applied later when investigating ( i ) the existence of sub - millisecond pulsars , and ( ii ) the nature of the six isolated nss discovered by _",
    "rosat_.      soon after the discovery of psrs , ostriker & gunn @xcite proposed that their surface magnetic field should not remain constant but decay . under this assumption",
    "they explained the absence of psrs with periods much longer than one second ( the decay of @xmath59 would bring the objects below the death line , turning off the active radio emission @xcite ) and the claimed dimming of the radio luminosity @xmath71 proportional to @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "their pioneering statistical study suggested that the nss at birth have very high magnetic moments @xmath73 g  @xmath74 , whose values decay exponentially due to ohmic dissipation in the ns interior , on a typical time - scale @xcite    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the conductivity , taken as uniform .",
    "ostriker & gunn evaluated @xmath77 using the electrical conductivity for the crystallized crust ( @xmath78 sec@xmath79 @xcite ) , thereby assuming implicitly that the magnetic field resides in the outer layers ( @xmath80 g @xmath81 ) of the star , and obtained @xmath82 but in the same year , baym , pethick & pines @xcite argued that the magnetic field pervades the entire star and so one had to adopt the much higher @xmath76 of the core , thus predicting a very long @xmath83 exceeding the hubble time , a result confirmed @xcite in 1971 when different conductivities in the ns interior were taken into account .",
    "when a larger number of pulsars became available for statistics , many authors compared the observations with population synthesis monte carlo models . at first @xcite data seemed to support evidence for field decay , but subsequent investigations @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite",
    "have indicated that the observed psr population is compatible with no decay or with decay on time - scales @xmath84 yr longer than the pulsar phase , beyond which the nss become practically invisible .",
    "there is a way to probe indirectly the possible decay of the field by searching for those old nss moving with low speed ( @xmath85 km s@xmath79 ) that can gravitationally capture the interstellar medium and shine as dim accreting sources . as discussed in @xmath86 , their presence in the galaxy",
    "depends on the evolution of the field .",
    "as far as the old msps are concerned , these sources possess very low values of @xmath87 @xcite when they appear as pulsars .",
    "the observations are again consistent with no field decay over their radio active phase , a result inferred from the old age of the dwarf companion stars , that implies a @xmath83 at least comparable to their true galactic age @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this does not preclude from the possibility that field decay has occurred during their previous evolution : this is discussed and described in @xmath88 .    in the next sections we survey the models for the decay of the magnetic field both for isolated nss and for the nss in binaries .",
    "models for magnetic field decay in isolated nss flourished over the last decade .",
    "a first improvement was to abandon the hypothesis of a uniform conductivity in the stellar crust and core ; @xmath76 increases when moving from the outer liquid layers to the deeper crystallized crust @xcite",
    ". sang & chanmugam @xcite noticed that the decay of a field residing only in the crust is not strictly exponential because of its inward diffusion toward regions of higher @xmath89 moreover , the decay rate depends on the ( highly uncertain ) depth penetrated by the initial field : the decay is more rapid if , at birth , the field resides in the outer lower density regions of the crust both because @xmath76 is lower and because @xmath83 depends on the length scale of field gradients ( less than a tenth of the stellar radius @xmath50 if @xmath59 is confined in the crust ) .",
    "the inclusion , in the calculation , of the cooling history of the ns was a second major improvement @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "it confirmed the non exponential behavior of the decay , showing in addition that a slower cooling would accelerate the decay ( as a warmer star has a lower conductivity ) . a first short phase ( @xmath90 yr ) of comparatively rapid decay was found , during which @xmath59 drops from values @xmath91 g@xmath74 , typical of young pulsars in supernova remnants , to more canonical values @xmath92 g @xmath74 typical of normal psrs . ( during this phase the electron - phonon interaction dominates @xmath76 ) . a second phase of no decay was found lasting @xmath93 myr , followed by a power - law decay ( dominated by the interaction of the electron upon the impurities ) and eventually an exponential decay .",
    "if the field penetrates the whole star , the core ohmic decay time - scale would be too long to allow decay @xcite .",
    "thus , an alternative scenario was proposed on the hypothesis that nss have superfluid and superconducting cores .",
    "the angular momentum of the core is believed to be carried by @xcite @xmath94 neutron vortex lines , parallel to the spin axis ; the magnetic flux should be confined in @xmath95 quantized proton flux tubes , where @xmath96 , with @xmath97 the average field strength in the core , expressed in units of @xmath98 g. in 1990 , srinivasan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested that the inter - pinning @xcite between these quantized entities causes the fluxoids to be carried and deposited in the crust as the ns spins down .",
    "the magnetic flux penetrated into the crust will then decay due to ohmic dissipation and the surface magnetic field of the ns keeps decreasing until it relaxes at the value of the residual field in the core . in this framework",
    "the _ spin history _ of the star drives and controls the changes of the magnetic field . assuming the same radial velocity for both the fluxoids and the vortices this model implies a time - evolution    @xmath99    occurring on a spin down time @xmath100    where index @xmath101 denotes values at the onset of phase @xmath4 , and @xmath102 the ns moment of inertia in units of @xmath103 g @xmath104 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_sif_simple ] ) models the simplest version of the _ spin down driven _",
    "( sdd ) decay of @xmath59 in isolated nss .",
    "it can be refined , accounting for the non instantaneous relaxation of the surface magnetic field to the value in the core @xcite .",
    "disappointedly , until now it has not been possible to perform a reliable statistical test of all the models .",
    "they predict clearly distinct evolutionary pathways only during the early stage of the pulsar life , namely during the first @xmath105 yr after birth .",
    "therefore a large sample of young nss is requested for a comparison . up to now , the pulsar catalog lists only an handful of such objects , as the observed psr population is dominated by elder sources , with characteristic time of few @xmath106 yr .",
    "in such situation , there is no statistical clue for rejecting the hypothesis of a non decaying field .",
    "some of the surveys in progress , as the one running at parkes @xcite , dedicated to the search of young psrs , could ultimately solve this problem .",
    "none of the models for spontaneous decay , proposed so far for the isolated objects , can explain magnetic moments of @xmath107 g @xmath74 , which are typical of the millisecond psrs . in order to attain these values of @xmath59 over a hubble time",
    ", the crustal models would require currents located only in a narrow layer below a density @xmath108 g@xmath81 , a very unlikely possibility .",
    "on the other hand , the `` sdd '' models would predict only a modest decrease of @xmath109 at most of two orders of magnitude with respect to the initial values .",
    "however , one common feature groups the low-@xmath59 objects , i.e. , that _ all the psrs with low magnetic moment spent a part of their life in a multiple stellar system_. guided by this fact , many authors have tried to relate the low values of @xmath59 with the interaction between the ns and its companion star(s ) .",
    "two different scenarios have been proposed so far : ( i ) the _ accretion driven scenario _",
    "developed under the hypothesis of a _ crustal magnetic field _ ; ( ii ) the _ spin driven scenario _ lying on the hypothesis of a _ core magnetic field_.    in this section we consider scenario ( i ) taking the hypothesis that the currents generating the field are located deep in the crust . a first observational suggestion about the effects of the accretion on a ( crustal ) magnetic field was given in 1986 by taam & van den heuvel @xcite : they noticed an approximate dependence of the surface magnetic field on the amount of mass accreted onto the neutron star .",
    "@xcite later presented an empirical formula for the decay in presence of accretion :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 represents the magnetic moment at the onset of accretion , @xmath112 is the amount of accreted mass and @xmath113 a parameter to be fitted with the observations .",
    "these authors claimed that @xmath114 could reproduce the taam & van den heuvel s correlation .",
    "zhang , wu & yang @xcite @xcite gave physical foundation to ( [ eq_shibazaki ] ) assuming that the compressed accreted matter has ferromagnetic permeability .",
    "however , using a larger database wijers @xcite showed that these models are not fully consistent with the available data both on x - ray binaries and recycled pulsars .",
    "romani @xcite first introduced the accretion rate @xmath115 as a second parameter in driving the magnetic moment decay in addition to @xmath116 .",
    "he pointed out that the accretion produces two major effects : ( i ) heating of the crust ( depending on @xmath115 ) , which determines a reduction of the conductivity ( and in turn the hastening of ohmic decay ) and ( ii ) advection of the field screened by the diamagnetic accreted material .",
    "moreover , the advection of the field lines stops when @xmath117 g @xmath74 , resulting in an asymptotic value for the magnetic moment ( in agreement with the observations ) .",
    "the existence of a bottom field ( with a predicted scaling @xmath118 ) is also possible if the currents sustaining the surface magnetic field of the ns are neutralized by the currents developed in the diamagnetic blobs of accreted matter @xcite . in this case",
    "the decay of @xmath59 typically ends when the accretion disc skims the ns surface @xcite .",
    "the first fully consistent theoretical calculations of the accretion - induced - decay of the crustal magnetic field of a ns was performed by urpin , geppert & konenkov @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the basic physical mechanism is the diffusion ( ohmic decay of currents ) and advection of the magnetic field sustained by currents circulating in the non superconducting crust .",
    "the magnetic field evolution is calculated according to the induction equation : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the magnetic induction and @xmath121 is the velocity of the moving fluid ( @xmath122 in a non accreting ns , @xmath123 for a radial approximation of the accreted fluid flow ) . in their calculation , the superconducting ns core is assumed to expel the magnetic field ( in the following we will refer to this boundary condition for the field at the crust - core interface as bci ) ; the induction equation is solved for a dipolar field and @xmath76 is given as in @xcite .",

    "phase iv lasts @xmath133 yr . the inserted panel enlarges the spin evolution during the very short phase at the boundary between phase iii and iv , that is when disc accretion sets in .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    accretion affects the ohmic decay in two ways : ( i ) _ heating the crust , _ so reducing @xmath76 ; ( ii ) _ transporting matter and currents _ toward the core - crust boundary .",
    "the relative importance of these two effects depends on other physical parameters , such as the initial depth penetrated by the currents , the impurity content ( @xmath134 ) , the accretion rate , the duration of the accretion phase and the equation of state of the nuclear matter . in coupling the magnetic history of the star to its spin evolution ( through @xmath13 to @xmath128 ) , urpin , geppert & konenkov @xcite found that _ neutron stars born with standard magnetic moments and spin periods can evolve to low - field rapidly rotating objects",
    "_ , as illustrated in figure [ fig_gepp_dec ] .    the behavior of currents and the response of nuclear matter to an interior field , at the interface between the crust and the core of a ns ( typical density @xmath135 g @xmath81 ) , is still an open issue for the theorists",
    "in view of these uncertainties , konar & bhattacharya @xcite chose a different boundary condition at the crust - core interface for solving the equation ( [ eq_induction2 ] ) .",
    "they noticed that the deposition of accreted matter on top of the crust can imply the assimilation of original current - carrying crustal layers into the superconducting core of the ns .",
    "in particular they assumed @xcite the _ newly formed superconducting material to retain the magnetic flux _ in the form of abrikosov fluxoids @xcite rather than to expel it through the meissner effect ( in the following this boundary condition will be labeled as bcii ) . within this model , accretion produces a third effect on the evolution of @xmath59 : ( iii ) the _ assimilation of material into the core _",

    "however , in this case the higher the accretion rate is , the stronger is the pull of crustal material into the core resulting in an earlier freezing of the decay . in a subsequent paper @xcite",

    "other refinements of the accretion - induced decay scenario include the effects of a non spherical symmetric accretion @xcite , the evolution of multipoles at the ns surface @xcite , the post - accretion increase of @xmath59 due to the re - diffusion of the buried field towards the surface @xcite , and the relativistic corrections to the decaying history @xcite .",
    "all together , they produce only slight changes to the aforementioned results .      both the simple idea of the flux conservation during the gravitational collapse and the action of a dynamo in the convective proto - neutron star @xcite lead to the existence of a magnetic field penetrating the whole ns . due to the huge conductivity of the core matter ,",
    "no ohmic decay occurs during a hubble time and so other effects have been invoked to account for the low field nss .",
    "besides magneto - dipole braking , a ns experiences a longer and more significant phase of spin - down , phase @xmath5 ( described in @xmath140 ) which enhances the effect of the spin - down driven scenario sketched in  [ subsec : sdd ] .",
    "this is particularly important when the ns lives in a binary system .",
    "miri & bhattacharya @xcite and miri @xcite explored the case of low mass systems showing that at the end of @xmath5 and @xmath6 phases the magnetic moment @xmath59 has decayed , relative to its initial value @xmath111 , by a factor scaling with @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the initial rotational period and @xmath143 the longest period attained during the phase where @xmath5 is active ( @xmath5 results from the interaction of the companion wind with the ns ) . assuming that the star spins - down to @xmath144 sec , a residual magnetic moment is    @xmath145    compatible with the values observed for msp population .",
    "recently , konar & bhattacharya @xcite re - examined this scenario in the case of accreting nss , incorporating the microphysics of the crust and the material movements due to the accretion .",
    "they concluded that the model can reproduce the values of @xmath59 observed in the low - mass systems only for large values of the unknown impurity parameter @xmath146 ( in contrast with accretion driven decay models demanding for values of @xmath147 ) .",
    "if the wind accretion phase is short or absent , @xmath134 should even exceed unity . a more serious objection to this model",
    "was risen by konenkov & geppert @xcite who pointed out that the motion of the proton flux tubes in the core leads to a distortion of the field structure near the crust - core interface and this in turn creates a back - reaction of the crust on the fluxoids expulsion : it results that ( i ) the sdd can be adequate for describing the @xmath59-evolution only for weak initial magnetic moments ( @xmath148 g @xmath74 ) and ( ii ) the predicted correlation @xmath149 is no more justified .",
    "finally , we have to mention another class of models in which the magnetic evolution is strictly related with the spin history of the star : in 1991 ruderman @xcite @xcite proposed that the coupling among @xmath12 and @xmath59 could take place via crustal plate tectonics .",
    "the rotational torques acting on the neutron star cause the crustal plates to migrate , thus dragging the magnetic poles anchored in them . as a consequence the effective magnetic dipole moment can strongly vary , either in intensity ( decreasing or growing ) and in direction , suggesting a tendency to produce an overabundance of both orthogonal ( spin axis @xmath150 magnetic axis ) and nearly aligned rotators ( spin axis @xmath151 magnetic axis ) .",
    "current observation of disc population msps seem compatible with this feature @xcite .",
    "moreover the crust - cracking events could account for the glitches seen in young psrs @xcite .",
    "a more extended description of the variety of the spin driven decay models can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "we here describe shortly possible ns pathways driven by the changes in the field and in the accretion rate , over phases @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath152 in low mass binaries and in the ism .",
    "the nss in binaries experience a complex evolution which is tightly coupled to the orbital and internal evolution of the companion star @xcite .",
    "the powerful pulsar wind initially sweeps the stellar wind away and the ns spends its lifetime in the @xmath4 phase . with the weakening of the electro - magnetic pressure with increasing period , an extended @xmath5 phase establishes ( lasting @xmath153 yr ) during which the ns is spun down further to periods of @xmath154 seconds in its interaction with the stellar wind of the companion star . when the period @xmath42 is attained , accretion sets in down to the ns surface and we could possibly trace this phase identifying the x - ray emission from the wind fed ns . here",
    "the ns can accrete with no exchange of angular momentum with the incoming matter unless the magnetic field decreases due to either accretion induced or spin induced decay .",
    "the ns can slide along the corresponding equilibrium spin - up line .",

    "<S> the thermal , spin and magnetic evolution of neutron stars in the old low mass binaries is first explored . </S>",
    "<S> recycled to very short periods via accretion torques , the neutron stars lose their magnetism progressively . if accretion proceeds undisturbed for 100 myrs these stars can rotate close to break up with periods far below the minimum observed of 1.558 ms . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate their histories using population synthesis models to show that a tail should exist in the period distribution below 1.558 ms . </S>",
    "<S> the search of these ultrafastly spinning neutron stars as pulsars can help discriminating among the various equations of state for nuclear matter , and can shed light into the physics of binary evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of isolated neutron stars in the galaxy is explored beyond the pulsar phase . </S>",
    "<S> moving through the tenuous interstellar medium , these old solitary neutron stars lose their rotational energy . </S>",
    "<S> whether also their magnetism fades is still a mystery . </S>",
    "<S> a population synthesis model has revealed that only a tiny fraction of them is able to accrete from the interstellar medium , shining in the x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> there is the hope that these solitary stars will eventually appear as faint sources in the _ chandra _ sky survey </S>",
    "<S> . this might give insight on the long term evolution of the magnetic field in isolated objects . </S>"
