    "in the near future , a large part of the high energy experimental program will be devoted to testing the cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa ( ckm ) picture of quark mixing and @xmath5 violation by directly measuring the sides and ( some ) angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "if the value of @xmath6 , the @xmath5 asymmetry in @xmath7 , is not too far from the cdf central value  @xcite , then searching for new physics at the @xmath0 factories will require a combination of several precision measurements .",
    "particularly important are @xmath1 and @xmath8 , which are the least precisely known elements of the ckm matrix .",
    "the latter will be measured hopefully in the upcoming run of the tevatron from the ratio of @xmath9 and @xmath10 mixing , and will not be discussed here .",
    "this talk is motivated by trying to understand what the chances are to    *  reduce ( conservative ) error in @xmath2 below @xmath11 ?",
    "although sometimes a smaller error is quoted already ( e.g. , by the particle data group ) , it is hard to bound model independently the possible quark - hadron duality violation in the inclusive , and the size of @xmath12 corrections in the exclusive determination .",

    " reduce the theoretical uncertainties in the @xmath14 photon spectrum ?",
    "the effect of the experimental cut on the photon energy needs to be better understood , and there are subtleties in the ope beyond leading order .",
    "the theoretical reliablility of inclusive measurements can be competitive with the exclusive ones ( or even better in some cases ) .",
    "for example , for the determination of @xmath2 model dependence enters at the same order of @xmath15 corrections from both the inclusive semileptonic @xmath16 width and the @xmath17 rate near zero recoil .",

    "for most quantities of interest , this result is known including the order @xmath21 and the dominant part of the order @xmath22 corrections .",
    "observables which do not depend on the four - momentum of the hadronic final state ( e.g. , total decay rate and lepton spectra ) receive no correction at order @xmath18 when written in terms of @xmath23 , whereas differential rates with respect to hadronic variables ( e.g. , hadronic energy and invariant mass spectra ) also depend on @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 mass difference in the @xmath19 limit . at order @xmath27",
    ", the corrections are parameterized by two hadronic matrix elements , usually denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the value @xmath30 is known from the @xmath31 mass splitting .    for inclusive @xmath32 decay , corrections to the @xmath19 limit",
    "are expected to be under control in parts of phase space where several hadronic final states are allowed to contribute with invariant masses satisfying @xmath33 .",
    "decay in the small velocity limit can be computed reliably , even though it is saturated by @xmath34 and @xmath35 only  @xcite .",
    "] such observables which  average \" sufficiently over different hadronic final states may be predicted reliably .",
    "( we are just beginning to learn quantitatively what sufficient averaging is . )",
    "the major uncertainty in these predictions is from the values of the quark masses and @xmath28 , or equivalently , the values of @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "these quantities can be extracted from heavy meson decay spectra , which is the subject of a large part of this talk .",
    "an important theoretical subtlety is related to the fact that @xmath25 can not be defined unambiguously beyond perturbation theory  @xcite , and its value extracted from data using theoretical expressions valid to different orders in the @xmath21 may vary by order @xmath36",
    ". however , these ambiguities cancel  @xcite when one relates consistently physical observables to one another , i.e. , the formulae used to determine @xmath25 and @xmath28 contain the same orders in the @xmath21 perturbation series as those in which the so extracted values are applied to make predictions .",
    "the shape of the lepton energy  @xcite or hadronic invariant mass  @xcite spectrum in semileptonic @xmath37 decay , and the photon spectrum in @xmath38  @xcite can be used to measure the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) parameters @xmath25 and @xmath28 . testing our understanding of the @xmath16 spectra is important to assess the reliability of the inclusive determination of @xmath2 , and especially that of @xmath1 .",
    "understanding the photon spectrum in @xmath4 is important to evaluate how precisely the total rate can be predicted in the presence of an experimental cut on the photon energy  @xcite .",
    "studying these distributions is also useful to establish the limitations of models which were built to fit the lepton energy spectrum in semileptonic decay .",
    "the theoretical predictions are known to order @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the coefficient of the one - loop @xmath41-function .",
    "this part of the order @xmath22 piece usually provides a reliable estimate of the full order @xmath22 correction , and it is straightforward to compute using the method of smith and voloshin  @xcite . in some cases",
    "the full @xmath22 correction is known . the order @xmath42 terms have also been studied  @xcite , and are used to estimate the uncertainties .    the ope for semileptonic ( or radiative ) @xmath0 decay does not reproduce the physical spectrum point - by - point in regions of phase space where the hadronic invariant mass of the final state is restricted .",
    "for example , the maximum electron energy for a particular hadronic final state @xmath43 is @xmath44 , so comparison with experimental data near the endpoint can only be made after sufficient smearing , or after integrating over a large enough region .",
    "the minimal size of this region was estimated to be around @xmath45mev @xcite .",
    "the hadron mass spectrum can not be predicted point - by - point without additional assumptions , but moments of it are calculable . in general , higher moments of a distribution or moments over smaller regions are less reliable than lower moments or moments over larger regions .",
    "the strategy is to find observables which are sensitive to @xmath25 and @xmath28 , but the deviations from @xmath20 quark decay are small , so that the contributions from operators with dimension greater than 5 are not too important .",
    "last year the cleo collaboration measured the first two moments of the hadronic invariant mass - squared ( @xmath47 ) distribution , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , subject to the constraint @xmath50gev  @xcite . here",
    "each of these measurements give an allowed band on the @xmath52 plane .",
    "these bands are almost perpendicular , so they give the fairly small intersection region shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the central values at order @xmath21 are @xcite @xmath53 the unknown order @xmath42 corrections not included in this result introduce a large uncertainty , especially for the second moment . as a result , the allowed range is much longer in the direction of the first moment band than perpendicular to it ; see fig .  2 .",
    "similar information on @xmath25 and @xmath28 can be obtained from the lepton energy spectrum , @xmath54 .",
    "it has been measured both by demanding only one charged lepton tag , and using a double tagged data sample where the charge of a high momentum lepton determines whether the other lepton in the event comes directly from semileptonic @xmath0 decay ( primary ) or from the semileptonic decay of a @xmath0 decay product charmed hadron ( secondary ) .",
    "the single tagged data has smaller statistical errors , but it is significantly contaminated by secondary leptons below about @xmath55gev",
    ". therefore , ref .",

    "the result of this analysis is also plotted in fig .  1 , and yields quite improbable values for @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath62gev introduces unnecessary model dependence , so this result may be less reliable than the hadronic invariant mass analysis .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath25 and @xmath28 are very sensitive to small systematic effects ; and it seems problematic for the exclusive models used for the extrapolation to simultaneously reproduce the inclusive lepton spectrum and the @xmath0 semileptonic branching fraction  @xcite .",

    "significantly \" but  consistently \" ) .",
    "can the theoretical uncertainties be reduced by combining the exclusive and inclusive determinations of @xmath2 ?",

    "however , for the electron endpoint region the contribution of states with masses nearer to @xmath172 is strongly suppressed kinematically .",
    "in fact , in the isgw model  @xcite the electron endpoint region is dominated by the @xmath173 and the @xmath174 with higher mass states making a small contribution , and this region includes only of order 10% of the @xmath175 rate .",
    "the situation is very different for the low invariant mass region , @xmath170 . now all states with invariant masses up to @xmath172 contribute without any preferential weighting towards the lowest mass ones . in this case",

    "consequently , it is much more likely that the first few terms in the ope provide an accurate description of @xmath0 semileptonic decay in the region @xmath170 than in the region @xmath177 .",
    "combining the invariant mass constraint with a modest cut on the electron energy will not destroy this conclusion .",

    "these shape functions depend on the same infinite set of matrix elements .",

    "( need : experimental cut on hadron mass as close to @xmath172 as possible , and a precise determination of @xmath25 . ) * the upsilon expansion is equivalent to using a short distance @xmath20 quark mass , but it eliminates @xmath23 altogether from the theoretical predictions in favor of @xmath224 in a simple and consistent manner .",
