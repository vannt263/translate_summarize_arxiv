    "b - meson light - cone distribution amplitudes ( das ) are the main nonperturbative input to the qcd description of weak decays involving light hadrons in the final state  @xcite . in particular the leading - twist da gives a dominant contribution in the heavy quark expansion and it received considerable attention already  @xcite .",
    "utility of the qcd factorization techniques depends , however , on the possibility to control , or at least estimate , the corrections suppressed by powers of the @xmath4-quark mass that involve higher - twist das .",
    "this task is attracting increasing attention and in the last years there have been several efforts to combine light - cone sum rules with the expansion in terms of b - meson das  @xcite .",
    "this technique allows one to tame infrared divergences which appear power - suppressed contributions in the purely perturbative framework and to calculate the so - called soft or end - point nonfactorizable contributions in terms of the das of increasing twist .",
    "one of the problems on this way is that higher - twist b - meson das involve contributions of multiparton states and are practically unknown .    in this letter",
    "we point out that the structure of subleading twist das is simpler as compared to what one may assume from their general partonic decomposition  @xcite .",
    "this structure is revealed by considering the scale dependence of the das in the limit of large number of colors , @xmath5 , i.e. neglecting the @xmath6 corrections to the renormalization group equations .",
    "it turns out that the evolution equation for the three - particle da in this approximation is completely integrable and can be solved exactly .",
    "the lowest anomalous dimension is separated from the rest , continuous , spectrum by a finite gap .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction defines what can be called the `` asymptotic '' three - particle b - meson da and has a relatively simple form .",
    "most remarkably , it turns out that the higher - twist contribution to the two - particle b - meson da @xmath1 that is related to the three - particle da by qcd equations of motion ( eom ) , is expressed entirely in terms of this `` asymptotic '' state , the states that belong to the continuous spectrum do not contribute . as the result",
    "the da @xmath1 evolves autonomously and does not mix with `` genuine '' three - particle contributions .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath1 is the same as for the leading - twist da @xmath2 up to a constant shift in the anomalous dimension .",
    "finally , we discuss the evolution of the three - particle da itself and its asymptotic behavior at small and large quark / gluon momenta which turns out to be nontrivial .",
    "this behavior is illustrated on the example of a simple model that can be used in phenomenological applications .",
    "following the established conventions  @xcite we define the b - meson das as matrix elements of the renormalized nonlocal operators built of an effective heavy quark field @xmath7 , a light ( anti)quark and gluons at a light - like separation : @xmath8 and @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the heavy quark velocity , @xmath11 is the light - like vector , @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 stands for an arbitrary dirac structure , @xmath15 is the @xmath16-meson state , @xmath17 is the factorization scale and @xmath18 is the b - meson decay constant in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "wilson lines connecting the fields are not shown for brevity ; they are always implied .",
    "the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the leading- and subleading - twist two - particle b - meson das  @xcite , and @xmath21 is the ( lowest twist ) three - particle da that is the only one relevant for the present study . in notations of @xcite @xmath22 .",
    "these three das are related by an eom  @xcite @xmath23 that can be solved to obtain @xmath24 as a sum of the so - called wandzura - wilczek ( ww ) term expressed in terms of @xmath19  @xcite , and a certain integral of the quark - gluon da @xmath21 .",
    "the latter contribution is nontrivial because it involves a function of two variables .",
    "we will demonstrate , however , that this complication is to a large extent illusory as the integral appearing in the eom essentially decouples from `` genuine '' quark - gluon correlations .",
    "this simplification is exactly analogous to what has been observed before  @xcite for the structure function @xmath25 in polarized deep - inelastic lepton - proton scattering .",
    "the following discussion is based on properties of the renormalization group equations for heavy - light operators under collinear conformal transformations .",

    "$ ] we distinguish the generators acting on quark and gluon coordinates by the subscript @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the starting observation is that both the one - loop renormalization group equations ( rge ) for the das and the eom relations are invariant under special conformal transformations  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to expand the das in terms of the eigenfunctions of the corresponding generator  @xcite @xmath34 they form a complete orthonormal set @xmath35 with respect to the @xmath30 invariant scalar product  @xcite @xmath36 where the integration goes over the complex coordinates @xmath37 in the lower half - plane @xmath38 and the integration measure is defined as @xmath39^{2j-2}.\\ ] ] going over from quark / gluon coordinates to the corresponding momenta @xmath40 can be done easily making use of the following expressions  @xcite : @xmath41 \\langle e^{-ikz}|q_s^{(j)}\\rangle_j & = \\gamma(2j)\\,(ks)^{1/2-j}\\ , j_{2j-1}(2\\sqrt{ks})\\ , .",

    "<S> we find that the evolution equation for the three - particle quark - gluon b - meson light - cone distribution amplitude ( da ) of subleading twist is completely integrable in the large @xmath0 limit and can be solved exactly . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest anomalous dimension is separated from the rest , continuous , spectrum by a finite gap . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding eigenfunction coincides with the contribution of quark - gluon states to the two - particle da @xmath1 so that the evolution equation for the latter is the same as for the leading - twist da @xmath2 up to a constant shift in the anomalous dimension . </S>",
    "<S> thus `` genuine '' three - particle states that belong to the continuous spectrum effectively decouple from @xmath1 to the leading - order accuracy . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the scale dependence of the full three - particle da turns out to be nontrivial so that the contribution with the lowest anomalous dimension does not become leading at any scales . </S>",
    "<S> the results are illustrated on a simple model that can be used in studies of @xmath3 corrections to heavy - meson decays in the framework of qcd factorization or light - cone sum rules . </S>"
