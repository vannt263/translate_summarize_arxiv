    "according to quark models , nucleons ( baryons ) are bound states of three constituent quarks .",
    "the excited states of these quarks give rise to the baryon resonance spectrum .",
    "there are many models @xcite that describe the interactions between the quarks in baryons . in spite of all these different approaches ,",
    "they pose the same common scenario : a greater number of predicted states as compared to the experimentally verified states . as an example , only nine @xmath4 resonances have been confirmed by experimental analyses ( as listed by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite ) whereas at least 21 states are predicted in the same energy range @xcite .",
    "the possible reason for the discrepancy is either the models are based on wrong assumptions or the analyses for the extraction of resonance information are incomplete . in this work we focus on the second possibility .",
    "almost all analyses @xcite use the study of @xmath0 elastic scattering as the main source for the extraction of @xmath4 resonance parameters .",
    "information on the coupling of resonances to other channels has come mainly from analyses of @xmath0 inelastic scattering .",
    "this might be the reason for the missing states as the @xmath0 channel is predicted to decouple from many resonances with masses above 1.7 gev @xcite .",
    "it is thus logical to look for resonances in other inelastic channels including photoproduction channels at the higher energies .",
    "an analysis that incorporates all possible channels simultaneously is highly desirable",
    ".    currently , other groups working on analyses of @xmath0 scattering are the ebac ( jlab ) group @xcite , the bonn - gatchina group @xcite , and the gwu / said @xcite group .",

    "currently , they have started to use a multichannel pwa giving equal importance to the inelastic channels .",
    "our approach is different and unique in the sense that it uses a generalized energy - dependent breit - wigner parametrization of amplitudes treating all the channels on an equal footing and taking full account of non - resonant backgrounds .",

    "interestingly we find all resonances listed in their analysis with masses below about 2100 mev .",
    "moreover , we find two additional resonances @xmath234 and @xmath254 . the other difference is we obtain both @xmath255 and @xmath256 helicity couplings while their analysis gives only @xmath255 couplings .",
    "we have good agreement with their results for @xmath257 , @xmath174 , @xmath124 , and @xmath258 , which strengthens the evidence for these newly proposed states .",
