    "ultracold atomic gases provide a unique environment to observe many body quantum phenomena on a mesoscopic scale , allowing microscopically derived field theories to be readily compared with experiments @xcite . for a bose gas at zero temperature a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) forms in which essentially all the atoms occupy a single spatial mode whose equilibrium and dynamics is well - described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite . a growing number of experiments have been performed in the _ finite temperature regime _ ,",
    "i.e.  at temperatures of order the critical temperature where many atoms are thermally excited out of the condensate , e.g.  studies of collective modes @xcite , vortex nucleation and decay @xcite , condensate growth  @xcite , phase transition dynamics @xcite , and superfluid turbulence @xcite . a quantitative description applicable to simulating many of these experiments , where thermal fluctuations and dynamics are important , remains a major technical challenge @xcite",
    ".    a promising direction of investigation for the finite temperature regime has been the generalization of gross - pitaevskii theory to describe the entire low energy part of the system .",
    "one approach , typically referred to as the _ classical field method _ @xcite , involves propagating the gpe with many suitably randomized modes .",
    "an alternative approach , central to the focus of this paper , is to extend the gpe with noise and damping terms that represent the coupling to a thermal reservoir of high energy atoms .",
    "recently such _ stochastic _ gpes have been applied to a broad range of problems , including defect formation across phase transitions @xcite , the decay of vortices  @xcite and solitons  @xcite , and polariton @xcite and spinor @xcite condensates .",
    "the technique has seen quite extensive applications to low dimensional systems where thermal fluctuations can prevent a true condensate from forming @xcite .    while phenomenological arguments can be used to obtain a generic stochastic gpe , it is possible to derive such a description from the microscopic theory of a bose gas .",
    "such formal derivations have been carried out by the groups of stoof @xcite and gardiner @xcite validating this approach as an _ ab initio _ description of non - equilibrium dynamics .    in this work we present the first complete implementation of the stochastic projected gross - pitaevskii equation ( spgpe ) , first introduced by gardiner and davis in 2003 @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the spgpe is to sub - divide the system modes into two regions : ( i ) a high energy region , referred to as the _ incoherent _ @xmath0-region , consisting of sparingly occupied modes ; ( ii ) a low energy region , the @xmath1-region , of appreciably occupied modes , i.e  not only the condensate , but all other highly bose - degenerate modes .",
    "the use of projection operators to define these regions is a key aspect in the derivation of the spgpe theory , and lead to an explicit projection operator in the equation of motion for the @xmath1-region .",
    "the thermal effects upon the @xmath1-region are described by two distinct processes : ( i ) _ growth processes _ where collisions between two @xmath0-region atoms leads to a change in population of the @xmath1-region ; ( ii ) _ scattering processes _ corresponding to collision between atoms in the @xmath1- and @xmath0-regions in which energy is transferred but particles are conserved .",
    "simulations including the growth process are relatively straightforward to carry out as the noise is additive and uncorrelated , and the damping term is proportional to the gross - pitaevskii evolution operator . implementing the scattering process is more technically challenging , as the noise is multiplicative and spatially correlated , and the associated damping term involves an intricate calculation of current in the @xmath1-region . to date all simulations of the spgpe have only included growth processes .",
    "the neglect of the scattering process has been argued as a reasonable approximation for systems near equilibrium , but is expected to play an important role in non - equilibrium regimes @xcite .",
    "indeed , work on condensate growth within quantum kinetic theory @xcite has shown that an analogous scattering reservoir interaction has a large effect on condensation dynamics @xcite .",
    "the broad outline of our paper is as follows :    in sec .",
    "[ sec : spgpeformalism ] we briefly review the spgpe formalism and introduce the full equation of motion . we also discuss the formal properties of the various parts of the spgpe formalism individually , since it has been reasonably common to neglect various terms and noises in the equations of motion to arrive at simpler theories ( e.g.  damped gpes ) . while the growth process gives rise to a grand canonical description of the @xmath1-region , we show that scattering processes ( without growth ) realize a canonical description . by only including the scattering process damping term ( i.e.  neglecting the associated noise ) we arrive at an _ energetically damped _ gpe that evolves any initial field to the zero temperature ground state by removing energy , but not population .",
    "we also evaluate the coefficients of the scattering term and compare it to that of the growth term in the experimental regime , showing the coefficients to be comparable in size .    in sec .",
    "[ secbreathingmode ] we present our main tests of the formalism , and study the evolution of a condensate initial excited into a large amplitude breathing mode .",
    "we give a number of analytic results that we have used to calibrate our numerical algorithm , and provide some insight into the effects of scattering processes .",
    "finally we present a study of the breathing mode in an experimentally realistic regime and demonstrate that the inclusion of scattering processes causes the system dynamics to change in a very significant manner .    after concluding and surveying the prospects for the full spgpe we provide a detailed overview of our numerical algorithm in the appendix .",

    "we see the damping of @xmath152 for all methods is broadly consistent with that of @xmath61 .",
    "however @xmath152 for the simple growth spgpe simulations shows an interesting difference : the oscillations decay within 10 trap cycles , despite @xmath152 ( as well as @xmath57 and @xmath61 ) being far from equilibrium . after this time @xmath152 decays slowly ( without oscillation ) towards the equilibrium value .      to understand the marked difference between the simple growth evolution and the other two theories it is useful to consider the behavior of the condensate , which we examine in fig .",
    "[ fig : condensate ] .",
    "we determine the condensate number from @xmath1-region field using the penrose - onsager definition @xcite : we form the one - body density matrix @xmath157 where angle - brackets denote an ensemble average over trajectories at a given time @xmath158 .",
    "the condensate number @xmath159 is defined as the largest eigenvalue of @xmath160 , and in our calculations always greatly exceeds the next largest eigenvalue .",
    "our initial state for the @xmath1-region is essentially a pure condensate , with @xmath161 at @xmath128 .",
    "similar to the observations made of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we see that @xmath162 reaches equilibrium far more rapidly for the full and scattering spgpes compared with the simple growth spgpe .",
    "our results show that in the simple growth spgpe the condensate fraction rapidly drops ( over a time period consistent with the rapid decay in @xmath163 ) to a minimum condensate number of @xmath164 at @xmath165 cycles . the very slow approach to equilibrium observed after this time corresponds to a re - condensation process , as can be seen in the long - time evolution of @xmath163 in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison](c ) .",
    "the scattering term ( i.e.  full and scattering spgpes ) allows a different and very effective route to rapidly dissipate the energy of the breathing mode without drastically reducing the condensate fraction .    .",
    "the spgpe ( black ) and scattering spgpe ( red ) simulations are shown in the inset , and the simple growth ( blue ) simulations are shown in the main figure . ]",
    "when the full spgpe theory was derived by gardiner and davis in 2003 they touted that  this approach is distinguished by the control of the approximations made in its derivation , and by the feasibility of its numerical implementation \" @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have finally realized a numerical implementation of this theory , and demonstrated practical simulations in the experimental regime .",
    "to date all applications of the spgpe have been made within the simple growth approximation in which the scattering terms are neglected . using our algorithm",
    "we are able to assess the effects of the scattering terms .",
    "we have verified that , when growth terms are neglected , the scattering terms evolve the system to an equilibrium state that is independent of the scattering amplitude coefficient ( @xmath77 ) , and that samples the canonical ensemble for the @xmath1-field region .",
    "the latter property is distinct to the simple growth and full spgpe descriptions that exchange both energy and particles with the reservoir , and hence sample the grand canonical ensemble in equilibrium .",
    "we have applied our theory to study the evolution of a finite temperature condensate excited into a large amplitude breathing mode in a physically realizable regime .",
    "an important , and somewhat surprising observation , is that the spgpe with the scattering terms predicts a qualitatively different evolution to the simple growth spgpe : with the inclusion of scattering , the breathing oscillation is efficiently damped without greatly depleting the condensate , allowing equilibrium to be established on a much shorter time scale .",
    "the energy damping is due to the scattering effective potential that precisely opposes superfluid motion , and the results suggest that the scattering describes coherent energy exchange with the reservoir , a striking consequence of bose - enhancement .",
    "our results indicate that scattering terms may be important in highly non - equilibrium regimes encountered in ultra - cold gases , and that quantitative evidence for the dominance of scattering over growth might be easily measured in experiments",
    ".    future work with the full spgpe will be to advance our understanding of non - equilibrium dynamics in the finite temperature regime .",
