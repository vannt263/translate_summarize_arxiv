    "<S> the original version of einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox is discussed to show the completeness of quantum mechanics ( qm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the unique solution leads to the wave function of antiparticle unambiguously , which implies the essential conformity between qm and special relativity ( sr ) .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 03.65.bz    einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) in their famous paper in 1935 @xcite insisted on querying that `` is the description of physical reality in quantum mechanics ( qm ) complete ? '' </S>",
    "<S> what epr were discussing is a system composing of two spinless particles . </S>",
    "<S> it was a very strange example@xcite , see below . </S>",
    "<S> so quite naturally , beginning from bohm @xcite , physicists have been turning to other experiments involving particle spin or photons . </S>",
    "<S> the investigations on these epr experiments together with the analysis of bell s inequality @xcite have been revealing that the prediction of qm is correct while the existence of local hidden variable ( lhv ) is incompatible with the outcome of experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a recent experiment @xcite even showed that the quantum correlation in an entangled state of two - photon system can be maintained over long distance exceeding 10 km . </S>",
    "<S> however , it seems to us that the original version of epr paradox still remains to be answered .    </S>",
    "<S> the question epr raised is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known in qm , the position of a particle , @xmath0 , and its momentum ( in one dimensional space ) operator    @xmath1    have a commutation relation : @xmath2=i\\hbar   \\label{e2}\\ ] ]    consider a two - particle system . </S>",
    "<S> then the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 will commute : @xmath5=0   \\label{e3}\\ ] ] which means that they have a common eigenstate with eigenvalues @xmath6 and @xmath7    now question arises : what strange the state is ! ? </S>",
    "<S> two particles are moving in opposite momentum directions while keeping their distance unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> incredible ! as stressed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : `` no one can figure out how to realize it '' . </S>",
    "<S> `` so there is no surprise that many people regarded the debate ( between epr and bohr ) as an idle talk leading only to empty result '' . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we believe in the basic principles of qm , any difficulty must have its root . </S>",
    "<S> is this implying something overlooked or unfinished in qm ?    in this letter , we wish to propose an answer to this epr paradox , which essentially prescribes the necessity of introducing the antiparticle state in qm and even dictates the form of its wave function ( wf ) unambiguously .    </S>",
    "<S> if the wf of particle 1 is written as usual :    @xmath8    with momentum @xmath9 and energy @xmath10 , then the particle 2 must be an antiparticle described by the following wf :    @xmath11    with @xmath12 , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> but as proposed by schwinger ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) and stressed by one of the present authors , ni ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we should view the wf of `` negative energy state '' of particle directly as the wf of its antiparticle with the corresponding antiparticle operators : @xmath14    so the observed momentum and energy of antiparticle in state ( [ e7 ] ) are @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , precisely the same as that of the particle state ( [ e6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the epr state @xmath17 is composed of a particle - antiparticle pair with parallel momentum ( @xmath15 ) and invariant distance @xmath3 between them . </S>",
    "<S> now every thing is reasonable .    in most text books on qm </S>",
    "<S> , there is nearly no clear explanation for wf of antiparticle . some times ( and often implicitly ) , it is said that the wf of antiparticle with momentum @xmath15 is the same as that of particle , i.e. , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e6 ] ) , one has to distinguish a positron from electron by adding some words . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one often said that in the vacuum all the negative energy states of electron are filled . </S>",
    "<S> once a `` hole '' is created in the `` sea '' , it would correspond to a positron .    in accompanying with the historic discovery of parity ( p ) violation by lee - yang @xcite and wu et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in 1956 , it was verified that the charge conjugate transformation ( c ) which brings an electron ( with charge @xmath18 ) to a positron ( with charge @xmath19 ) is also violated @xcite . in 1964 </S>",
    "<S> , the combined cp violation was discovered in @xmath20 system whereas the cpt theorem remains valid . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experiment by cplear collaboration at cern provides further direct observation of time - reversal ( t ) non - invariance in the neutral - kaon system @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> what do all the above discoveries mean ?    in our point of view , all the above discoveries imply that the individual definition of p , c or t inversion ceases to be meaningful as an observable transformation in physics . </S>",
    "<S> of course , their definitions are still clearcut in mathematics . </S>",
    "<S> let us perform the combined cpt transformation on the wf of a particle , either with or without spin . </S>",
    "<S> ( see , e.g. in @xcite ) . because the c or t transformation contains a complex conjugation respectively , they cancel each other in the cpt transformation </S>",
    "<S> . then what we obtain is essentially a transformation @xmath21 while at the same time we should look at the wf describing an antiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> this is nothing but a statement of transforming eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e6 ] ) to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e7 ] ) . and </S>",
    "<S> this is why physicists have been gradually accepting the relation of a particle @xmath22 with respect to its antiparticle @xmath23 being @xcite    @xmath24    the reason why the observation eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e6])-([e8 ] ) had not attracted enough attention in physics community for so long a time is of two fold . </S>",
    "<S> first , the inertia of concept in physics proves its strength once again as witnessed in the history of science from time to time . </S>",
    "<S> second , the importance of the above observation has not fully explored until its evolving into the following postulate : `` the space - time reversal @xmath25 transformation is equivalent to the transformation between particle and antiparticle . '' this is a basic symmetry which should be respected in constructing the theory for all particles and fields . </S>",
    "<S> thus a particle is always not pure . </S>",
    "<S> a particle state @xmath26 is always accompanied by its antiparticle state @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> they have the simple relation :    @xmath28    the coupled equations should be invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath29 together with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e10 ] ) .    based on this symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the essence of special relativity ( sr ) is explored and the one - body relativistic equation , i.e. , the dirac equation and klein - gordon equation , are derived @xcite . moreover , even to our surprise , we began to realize that the stationary schrdinger equation ( sse ) for many - body system is essentially relativistic as long as the eigenvalue in sse    @xmath30    ( say for two - body case , @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the reduced mass ) is related to the binding energy @xmath33 ( @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 being the rest mass and energy of whole system , @xmath37 ) as follows ( @xcite , @xcite ) :    @xmath38   \\label{e12}\\ ] ]    it is interesting to see that the relativistic correction in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e12 ] ) for hydrogenlike atom is a small downward energy shift    @xmath39    which only accounts for ( @xmath40 ) , or ( @xmath41 ) in the magnitude of the so - called absolute lamb shift ( upward ) @xmath42 of 1s state in hydrogen atom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on the new understanding of sse , eq ( [ e11 ] ) , a simple noncovariant calculation on lamb shift is performed in ref @xcite with high accuracy ( @xmath43 ) .    in summary , some discussions are in order :    \\(a ) the original version of epr paradox was a simple but acute problem querying on whether the qm is complete . if instead of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e3 ] ) we consider    @xmath44=0   \\label{e14}\\ ] ]    then the correct answer turns out to be a particle and its antiparticle ( @xmath45 ) moving in opposite direction with momentum @xmath15 and @xmath46 and position @xmath47 and @xmath48 . such kind of experiments have been performed for many times . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the @xmath49 and @xmath50 pair can be created by a high energy photon in the vicinity of heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath51 excited state of @xmath52 nuclei lies higher @xmath53 than the ground @xmath51 state , so it can also give rise to pair creation of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the experiment at cern again demonstrated the quantum correlation at a distance for kaon and antikaon system . they are entwined . </S>",
    "<S> only until the measurement on @xmath15 direction to see a particle ( or antiparticle ) , can one predict with 100 percent probability that an antiparticle ( or particle ) appearing in the @xmath54 direction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all epr experiments in the past 64 years have been proving the validity and completeness of qm , excluding the existence of lhv . </S>",
    "<S> what we add in this letter is that some times the including of antiparticle is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the correct answer to the original version of epr paradox is a unique solution . </S>",
    "<S> there is no other alternative .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(b ) the cognition of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e6])-([e9 ] ) is in total conformity with the long investigation on the problem of c , p and t reversal since the discovery of parity violation in 1956 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the cpt theorem already exhibits itself as a basic postulate . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation of a particle to its antiparticle is not some thing which can be defined independently but a direct consequence of ( newly defined ) space - time reversal @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(c ) the above basic symmetry should be pushed forward into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e10 ] ) , forming a starting point to construct the sr , the relativistic qm and the quantum field theory ( qft ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xcite , @xcite see also @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(d ) what we are discussing is the essential conformity between qm and sr . in some sense </S>",
    "<S> the subtle relationship between them lies in the essential equivalence of `` @xmath55 '' and `` @xmath56 '' . indeed , at the very elementary level of physics , `` that not forbidden is allowed '' ( m. gell - mann ) . </S>"
