    "magnets play a central role in different types of devices and motors , which are at the heart of modern technology .",
    "there is an increasing need of permanent magnetic materials for energy conversion and power generation  @xcite .",
    "magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( ma ) is one of the most important properties of permanent magnets  @xcite .",
    "large ma is achieved in existing strong magnets by using rare - earth transition - metal intermetallic compounds , such as smco@xmath0 and nd@xmath1fe@xmath2b , which are of direct technological use .",
    "however , the shortage of rare - earth elements has triggered the search for rare - earth - free magnetic materials harnessing sources of magnetic anisotropy other than that provided by the rare - earth components  @xcite . in order to guide this search ,",
    "it is necessary to develop theoretical methods that can estimate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 transition metals , which are the natural candidates for replacing rare - earth elements .",
    "the contribution of itinerant ferromagnetic electrons to ma arises from the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction that couples the spin and orbital components of the magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "ma results from the orbital component of the moment , which is sensitive to the lattice anisotropy .",
    "the very first electronic structure analysis of mae for ni was conducted by kondorskii and straub  @xcite .",
    "while a band picture may provide a mae of the right order of magnitude for certain transition metal ferromagnets  @xcite , accurate electronic structure calculations of the mae of 3@xmath6 metals , such as fe , co and ni , give numbers that are in disagreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the wrong easy - axis is obtained for ni .",
    "this failure has been attributed to either the omission of the orbital correlation induced by the intra - atomic coulomb interaction between electrons  @xcite or the limitation of band structure calculations for calculating energy differences of the order of 0.1  mev  @xcite .",
    "yco@xmath0 has one of the largest maes among ferromagnets that do not include @xmath7-electron ( actinide or lanthanide ) ions .",
    "the mae is more than 50 times larger than in the pure cobalt metal .",
    "like smco@xmath0 , it has an easy - axis parallel to the @xmath8-axis of its hexagonal lattice structure .",
    "the primitive unit cell contains six atoms with two different cobalt sites , co@xmath9 ( 2c ) and co@xmath10 ( 3 g )  @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering experiments by schweizer _",
    "et al . _ have reported unusually large orbital moments on these co sites  @xcite : m@xmath11(co(2c))=0.46@xmath12 and m@xmath11(co(3g))=0.28@xmath12 .",
    "however , our x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) measurements indicate that the average orbital moment of co is @xmath13  @xmath12 , in better agreement with the value of @xmath14  @xmath12 reported by heidemann _",
    "et al . _",
    "these measurements suggest that the rather large orbital magnetic moments of the co atoms are partially responsible for the strong mae of yco@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , reliable estimates of the mae require an accurate calculation of these orbital moments .",
    "this is not only true for yco@xmath0 , but also for any other strong magnet based on transition metals .",
    "we will then use yco@xmath0 as a prototype compound for developing and testing methods for calculating the orbital moments and the mae of strong magnets .",
    "nordstrm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have applied the force theorem to compute the mae of yco@xmath0 from first - principles calculations .",
    "it was found that , in the absence of atomic orbital correlation , the mae is too small and it even has the incorrect sign , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite . after including the orbital polarization ( op ) scheme suggested by brooks",
    "@xcite , they were able to obtain a mae that has the correct sign .",
    "however , the mae value of about 50@xmath15ryd , when extrapolated to the infinitesimal grid in the momentum space although , is still too small in comparison with the experimental value of 292 @xmath15ryd  @xcite .",
    "a similar improvement is obtained for estimations of the orbital magnetic moments of both co sites . in absence of orbital correlation , the result is m@xmath11(co(2c))=0.1@xmath12 and m@xmath11(co(3g))=0.13@xmath12  @xcite , while the inclusion of op leads to m@xmath11(co(2c))=0.27@xmath12 and m@xmath11(co(3g))=0.20@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the op scheme is taken from the theory of open shell atoms within the russel - saunders coupling .",
    "the ground state energy gain , that is obtained by maximizing the orbital angular momentum @xmath16 , is approximated by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the racah parameter for @xmath6 sates .",
    "this effect is just a consequence of the coulomb interaction between @xmath6-electrons that occupy the same ion and it must influence the final value of the orbital magnetic moment and the mae .",
    "however , it is well known that the on - site electron - electron coulomb interaction also renormalize the band states ( electrons tend to avoid each other ) , for which heavy fermion behavior in @xmath7-electron systems is a prototypical example  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that this second consequence of the coulomb interaction will also affect the magnitude of the orbital magnetic moment and the mae .",
    "here we propose a method for including these additional correlations .",
    "the effect of electron - electron interaction is to reduce the bandwidth of the quasi - particles and produce an incoherent component in their spectral weight .",
    "the most dramatic effect of this coulomb repulsion is the emergence of mott insulators in half - filled bands via localization of individual electrons in their atomic orbitals .",
    "the electronic localization is accompanied by the formation of a local magnetic moment , whose spin and orbital components can be of the order of a bohr magneton ( @xmath12 )  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that coulomb interaction can not localize the electronic charge away from half - filling .",
    "however , the band narrowing effect can be interpreted as a tendency towards localization that favors local moment formation .",
    "this simple reasoning suggest that the inclusion of electronic correlations should lead to more realistic values of the effective mass of the quasiparticles , orbital magnetic moments and mae .",
    "standard lda calculations lead to orbital magnetic moments of order 0.1@xmath12 .",
    "this result can be understood in the following way .",
    "the typical bandwidths , @xmath19 , of @xmath3 metals like fe or co are of the order of a few electron volts . the so interaction is about @xmath20 ev . in the absence of so coupling",
    ", the ground state has zero orbital angular momentum , even if it has a net spin magnetization , because single - particle states with opposite values of the orbital magnetic moment are degenerate and therefore equally occupied .",
    "a finite so coupling term splits states with opposite values of orbital moment by an amount that is of order @xmath21 .",
    "this observation implies that only the electronic states that are within a distance @xmath21 from the fermi level contribute to orbital polarization .",
    "the fraction of electrons occupying these states is of order @xmath22 .",
    "because the maximum possible value of the orbital moment per atom is of order @xmath23 , this rough estimate indicates that @xmath24 in agreement with previous results from standard band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out in the introduction , the orbital magnetic moment of strong magnets , such as yco@xmath0 , can be higher than this rough estimate .",
    "it is natural to assume that the discrepancy arises from the effects of rather strong intra and inter - atomic electronic correlations induced by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the improvement that is obtained after including the intra - atomic op effect provides empirical support for this assumption .",
    "however , the most basic and general argument in favor of this assumption is that intra - atomic coulomb repulsion favors local moment formation by suppressing double occupancy of single atomic orbitals .",
    "the importance of correlation effects on the magnetic anisotropy of fe and ni was already recognized more than ten years ago by yang _",
    "et al . _",
    "this problem is now timely because of the increasing need of finding strong magnets that are free of rare earth elements .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to propose new methods that can incorporate the subtle effects of correlations in solids ( the op effect that we discussed above is already captured at the level of single - atom physics ) . for this purpose",
    "we propose a method based on the combination of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) and the lda  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach has been successfully applied to the calculation of neutron magnetic form factors of actinides by applying an external magnetic field  @xcite , as well as the bulk and surface quasiparticle spectra  @xcite and the orbital magnetism  @xcite in fe , co , and ni metals .",
    "the basic idea is to treat each co ion as an effective impurity that is embedded into the bath generated by the rest of the ions .",
    "the single - ion interactions ( including the op ) are captured by the single - impurity hamiltonian .",
    "the correlations developed via the interplay between the single - ion terms and the interaction with the bath ( solid ) are captured by a self - consistent treatment of the full hamiltonian that we describe in the next section .",
    "to study the role of electronic correlations on the orbital moment of the magnetic @xmath3 ions by combining the lda with dynamical mean - field theory ( lda+dmft )  @xcite we start with a generalized many - body hamiltonian : @xmath25_{l m_l \\sigma , l^{\\prime } m_l^{\\prime}\\sigma^{\\prime } } c_{\\mathbf{k}lm_l\\sigma}^{\\dagger } c_{\\mathbf{k}l^{\\prime } m_l^{\\prime } \\sigma^{\\prime }   } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2 }   \\!\\!\\!\\ ! \\sum_{\\begin{subarray } i , l=2(3),m_l m^{\\prime}_l , \\\\",

    "the first term of @xmath36 contains the single - particle contribution , which is determined by solving the kohn - sham quasi - particle equations  @xcite within lda .",
    "we note that the so coupling can be included in a second variational way in the lda hamiltonian . in the second term of @xmath36",
    "we restrict the coulomb repulsion to the correlated orbitals ( e.g. , open shell co 3@xmath6 orbitals @xmath37 or ce 4@xmath7 orbitals @xmath38 ) to reduce the complexity of the problem  @xcite . the coulomb matrix elements are obtained from atomic physics : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the slater integrals and the corresponding expansion coefficients  @xcite . for solids , we identify the atomic slater integral @xmath42 with the screened effective coulomb interaction parameter @xmath43 of the correlated orbitals . as a common practice , higher order slater integrals are reduced by 20% from the atomic hartree - fock calculations due to screening effects  @xcite .",

    "because we have added the on - site coulomb terms to the correlated valence orbitals only , it is evident that the self - energy @xmath50 matrix has nonzero elements only within the @xmath51 @xmath6-@xmath6 block for the case of valence @xmath6-orbitals , or the @xmath52 @xmath7-@xmath7 block for the case of valence @xmath7-orbitals .",
    "this self - energy matrix is a function of the matsubara frequency : @xmath53 .",
    "correspondingly , the local green s function for the correlated orbitals has the same structure @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that the dominant contributions to the spin and orbital components of the magnetic moments come from the correlated orbitals ( co 3@xmath6-orbitals for the case of yco@xmath0 ) . after obtaining the local green s function for the correlated orbitals through the full self - consistency",
    ", we can evaluate the spin and orbital moments by computing @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively , in the spherical harmonics basis . here the density matrix is related to the local green s function as @xmath57 where @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 the boltzmann constant and temperature , respectively .    in earlier applications of the lda+dmft method ,",
    "it is common use to rotate the local green s function and the corresponding self - energy into a basis in which the diagonal matrix elements are dominant in order to neglect the off - diagonal elements . for example , for actinide based materials , the correlated 5@xmath7 orbitals are rotated into the @xmath61-@xmath61 basis because of the dominant so coupling  @xcite . in contrast , so coupling is subdominant for @xmath6-electron materials , like transition metal oxides , and the self - energy and local green s function matrices are diagonal in the crystal field basis when the so coupling is neglected  @xcite .",
    "however , the off - diagonal matrix elements can not be neglected if our goal is to compute the mae ( the so coupling must be included to obtain a finite mae and the orbital magnetic moment has only off - diagonal contributions in this basis ) .",
    "this situation requires a further development of quantum impurity solvers to meet this challenge and similar challenges posed by other correlated electron materials , such as the inclusion of crystal field terms in 4@xmath7 and 5@xmath7 compounds .",

    "note that some additional contribution to the electronic renormalization arising from the electron - phonon coupling is not included in our calculations . because @xmath91 is equal to @xmath84",

    "this observation confirms the relevant role of @xmath43 on the formation of a strong orbital moment .",

    "this dramatic increase not only explains the reason why lda calculations systematically underestimate the mae of strong magnets , but also shows the crucial role played by electronic correlations in the development of large magnetic coercivity .",
    "in addition , the mae obtained from our lda+dmft calculations for @xmath43 between 3 and 3.5 ev is in good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "the fact that the strongest magnets are rare - earth based compounds , suggests that the large magnitude of the so coupling plays a crucial role in the development of high coercivity .",
    "one would then expect that the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy of nd@xmath1fe@xmath2b or smco@xmath0 originates in the crystal field splitting of the rare - earth 4@xmath7 levels .",
    "there is experimental evidence , however , indicating that substantial magnetocrystalline anisotropy may be associated with the transitional metal sublattice itself .",
    "for instance , the coercive field of magnetically hardened gd@xmath1fe@xmath2b is  2.5 koe  @xcite , but the gd@xmath100 ion has no significant contribution from 4@xmath7-electrons to the orbital moment , suggesting an increasing role of gd @xmath5-orbital electrons  @xcite . in addition , the mae of smco@xmath0 is only three times higher than the mae of yco@xmath0 and y is non - magnetic .",
    "our results indicate that the mae of a magnet is dramatically modified by the presence of strong on - site coulomb interaction @xmath43 that tends to localize the electrons .",
    "we note that enhanced correlations could also be playing a role in rare - earth based compounds ( rare - earths have large ionic radii ) .",
    "this may explain why rare - earth based compounds , in which the rare - earth has no orbital moment , still have very high mae .    by a close comparison of our lda+dmft calculations with different key experimental measurements",
    ", we have shown that electronic correlation effects play an essential role in determining the mae of yco@xmath0 .",
    "these calculations suggest that the figure of merit of strong magnets can be greatly optimized by tuning the electron coulomb repulsion @xmath43 .",
    "our analysis has natural implications for the search of rare - earth free strong magnets .",
    "while it may be important to retain a large so coupling , it is equally or even more important to find strongly correlated ferromagnets in order to induce a large enough orbital moment on the transition metal .",
    "developing predictive tools for the mae of strong magnets is an essential precondition for guiding the search for new materials .",
    "our results indicate that lda+dmft techniques are very promising because they incorporate the relevant interplay between kinetic and coulomb energies .",

    "<S> the new challenges posed by the need of finding strong rare - earth - free magnets demand methods that can predict magnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that correlated electron effects , which are normally underestimated in band structure calculations , play a crucial role in the development of the orbital component of the magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> because magnetic anisotropy arises from this orbital component , the ability to include correlation effects has profound consequences on our predictive power of the mae of strong magnets . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that incorporating the local effects of electronic correlations with dynamical mean - field theory provides reliable estimates of the orbital moment , the mass enhancement and the mae of yco@xmath0 . </S>"
