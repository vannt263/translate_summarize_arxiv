    "very significant resources are being invested in large surveys of the stellar content of our galaxy .",
    "we clearly are under an obligation to make every effort to extract as much science from these expensive data as we can .",
    "a survey catalogue is always dominated by selection effects : it contains stars that are nearby and luminous .",
    "moreover several of the quantities measured for stars , for example parallax @xmath2 , proper motion @xmath3 , @xmath4 enhancement @xmath5 $ ] , contain non - negligible errors , and the quantities of physical interest that we derive from them , such as distance @xmath6 , luminosity @xmath7 and velocity @xmath8 , have correlated errors with highly non - gaussian error distributions .",
    "models play a vital role in extracting science from surveys by taking into account ( i ) selection effects ( ii ) measurement errors and ( iii ) combining constraints on the properties of the galaxy from different surveys . here",
    "we illustrate these principles .",
    "there is a long tradition of extracting science from surveys with kinematic models such as the besanon model @xcite .",
    "these models are constructed by assigning to each spatial point a velocity ellipsoid , generally assumed to be gaussian .",
    "equilibrium dynamical models are superior to kinematic models in several ways .    *",
    "although the galaxy can not be in dynamical equilibrium , equilibrium models are of fundamental importance because an estimate of the galaxy s gravitational potential @xmath9 is key for any modelling enterprise and we can constrain @xmath10 only to the extent that the galaxy is in dynamical equilibrium : if it is allowed to be out of equilibrium , _ any _ distribution of stars in phase space is consistent with _ any _ gravitational potential ",
    "we constrain @xmath10 by assuming that the potential is deep enough to prevent stars flying apart in the next dynamical time but not so deep as to cause them to slump into the centre in the same period . * equilibrium dynamical models have much less freedom than kinematic or non - equilibrium models because their velocity structure is firmly tied to the density structure by the assumed potential",
    ". consequently a small number of parameters suffices to specify a realistic dynamical model , and optimising the model by adjusting these parameters is reasonably straightforward .",
    "* observed velocity distributions are far from gaussian but are well reproduced by quasi - isothermal s. * a properly constructed equilibrium dynamical model can be used as the foundation for the construction of non - equilibrium models via perturbation theory . in this way",
    "the model can be extended to include non - equilibrium phenomena such as spiral structure and the warp .",
    "we have known since the numerical experiments of the 1960s that most orbits in galaxy - like flattened , axisymmetric potentials admit three integrals of motion , and by the strong jeans theorem the distribution function ( ) of an equilibrium model can be assumed to be a function @xmath11 of these integrals . since any function @xmath12 of the integrals is obviously itself an integral of motion , there is considerable choice in what we use for arguments of the .",
    "one choice stands out above all others : the action integrals @xmath13 .",
    "the special properties enjoyed by the actions include : ( i ) they alone can be complemented by canonically conjugate variables @xmath14 to form a complete set of canonical coordinates @xmath15 for phase space ; ( ii ) the space in which the actions are cartesian coordinates , action space , provides an undistorted compression of six - dimensional phase space in the sense that the volume of phase space occupied by orbits with actions in @xmath16 is @xmath17 ; ( iii ) actions are adiabatic invariants so when the galaxy s potential is slowly deepened , for example by the accretion of gas to form the disc , the orbits of stars change but their actions do not .",
    "the property of adiabatic invariance enables us to compute the effects of accretion without knowing precisely how the accretion occurred  we need to know only the initial and final potentials , not the intermediate potentials .",
    "the ability to embed the actions in a complete system of canonical coordinates is the key handling non - equilibrium aspects of the galaxy through perturbation theory ",
    "angle - action coordinates were invented in the 19th century in order to compute the dynamics of the solar system using perturbation theory .",
    "particle physics , condensed - matter physics , plasma physics , and celestial mechanics are all built around perturbation theory , which is not merely the means by which we compute the implications of models but provides the concepts ",
    "feynman diagrams , phonons , spin - waves , mean - motion resonances , etc .",
    ",  with which we understand the phenomena .",
    "galactic dynamics will remain a primitive branch of physics until it too makes extensive use of perturbation theory , and our first step towards that goal must be expressing equilibrium models in terms of angle - action coordinates .",
    "the angular momentum around the galaxy s approximate symmetry axis @xmath18 is one of the three actions .",
    "the best expressions we have @xcite for the integral of motion that controls the extent of a star s excursions perpendicular to the galactic plane are for the vertical action @xmath19 .",
    "consequently the only real temptation to employ an integral that is not an action is the temptation to use the energy @xmath20 as the third integral rather than the radial action @xmath21 , which controls the extent of a star s radial oscillation .",
    "for some the arguments advanced above for choosing @xmath21 over @xmath20 do not suffice to wean them off @xmath20 , and to these people we say that if your  has the form @xmath22 it is quite tricky to find the self - consistent gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "indeed , the search for @xmath10 proceeds iteratively  one guesses @xmath10 , evaluates the density @xmath23 then implied , solves poisson s equation for the corresponding potential @xmath24 and repeats the process until convergence . at each iteration the central potential changes , with the result that the density depends upon a different range of values of @xmath20 , and the iterations converge only if some subtle scalings are employed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ( b ) ) .",
    "since actions always range from 0 for a star that rests at the bottom of the potential well to @xmath25 for marginally bound stars , when we adopt @xmath26 the iterations converge automatically .    in the following",
    "we take the  to have the form @xmath26 and not waste time on more traditional formulations .",
    "@xcite showed that superpositions of quasi - isothermal s give good fits to the geneva - copenhagen catalogue and successfully predict data from the sdss and rave surveys . a quasi - isothermal  has the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is essentially the radial scale length of the disc , @xmath29 is the radius of a circular orbit of angular momentum @xmath18 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the radial and vertical epicycle frequencies of this orbit , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are approximately equal to the radial and vertical velocity dispersions of the disc at @xmath34 .",
    "the name `` quasi - isothermal '' for this  derives from the observation that in the epicycle approximation @xmath35 is the in - plane epicycle energy and @xmath36 is the energy of vertical oscillations , so the  becomes an exponential function of these energies like the gibbs distribution of standard statistical mechanics .",
    "the hipparcos data showed that the velocity dispersions of thin - disc stars grow with age @xmath37 roughly as @xmath38 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , so @xcite set @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a parameter that controls the velocity dispersion of the stars at birth , @xmath41 is the age of the oldest thin - disc stars and @xmath42 is essentially the present velocity dispersion at @xmath34 .",
    "this dispersion is expected to decrease outwards through the disc , and an appropriate functional form is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a number , @xmath45 is the radius over which the velocity dispersion falls by a factor @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite showed that the hipparcos data are consistent with the hypothesis that the star formation rate ( sfr ) near the sun has varied with time as @xmath47 so a reasonable form for the  of the thin disc is @xmath48 that is , the thin disc is modelled as a superposition of quasi - isothermal discs , one for each coeval cohort of stars , with the velocity dispersion of each cohort increasing with age .",
    "b12 took the thick disc to be a single quasi - isothermal comprising exclusively old stars .",
    "the  of the complete disc is then @xmath49 where the individual s are normalised such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the fraction of the mass of the disk contributed by the thick disc .      in principle",
    "every observationally distinguishable class of star can have its own .",
    "kinematics and chemistry are highly correlated , so stars with different metallicities must have different s. we can model this situation by extending the  above to an extended distribution function ( ) , which is a function of chemical composition in addition to actions .",
    "we start by supposing that the chemical composition of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is at any given time a function of galactocentric radius @xmath52 only , and that the chemical composition of a star is the same as that of the ism at the coordinates @xmath53 of its birth .",

    "[ jjbfig : zhist ] shows the time dependence of metallicity at several radii in the model of @xcite .",

    "to test a model by comparing it with a catalogue , we have to `` observe '' the model in in the same way that the survey observes the galaxy .",
    "most of the major surveys now underway make strenuous efforts to be photometrically complete in some well - defined way .",
    "nevertheless this completeness is achieved , if at all , only in the final data release because a host of complex constraints and considerations affect the order in which targets are selected  bright stars are likely to be selected ahead of faint ones , and in crowded fields it may be impossible to sweep up adjacent targets in the first visit to the field . fortunately , these considerations are almost always velocity - blind in the sense that the probability that a given star is included in a particular data release is rigorously independent of its velocity . in these circumstances",
    "it is easy to test a model with a catalogue for which we have estimates of distance and chemical composition as follows .",
    "we bin the stars spatially and chemically in any convenient way . for each star in a bin",
    "we choose a hypothetical true distance @xmath77 using either a simple gaussian distribution in @xmath77 or , more rigorously , using the a posteriori probability distribution of @xmath77 for each star that is returned by a bayesian distance - determination algorithm @xcite .",
    "the probability distributions from a bayesian algorithm are clearly to be preferred because they take into account the higher density of stars near us than further away and also distance ambiguities associated with uncertainty as to whether a star is a dwarf or some type of giant . in the same spirit",
    "we select a hypothetical true metallicity @xmath78 by sampling the product of the model s metallicity distribution along that line of sight and the probability distribution of measurement errors in @xmath59 .",
    "once hypothetical true values of all relevant observables have been selected in this way , we sample the model s velocity distribution at the hypothesised location @xmath79 we convert @xmath8 into the line of sight velocity @xmath80 and proper motion @xmath81 using the hypothesised distance @xmath77 .",
    "next we add to @xmath80 and @xmath81 appropriate measurement errors before converting them back to a space velocity @xmath8 using the measured distance @xmath6 .",
    "these velocities constitute the model s predictions for the distribution of velocities of catalogued stars in the given spatial bin .",
    "these predictions take fully into account all measurement errors , no matter how gross , in distances , velocities and metal abundances .",
    "if the measurement errors have been correctly assessed , any statistically significant discrepancy between this theoretical velocity distribution and the observed one must reflect a shortcoming of the model .",
    "b12 fitted a  @xmath26 to the geneva - copenhagen catalogue ( gcs ) of f and g stars @xcite as follows .",
    "first the thin - disc  was fitted to the histograms of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 velocity components .",
