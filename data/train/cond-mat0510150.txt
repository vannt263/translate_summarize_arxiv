    "recently the question whether a mott insulator and a band insulator are fundamentally different has been raised @xcite . to study this question , we consider the simplest model which allows , by tuning one parameter , to obtain a mott insulator as well as a band insulator phase .",
    "the model consists of two hubbard systems with strong on - site coulomb repulsion which are connected by single particle hopping .",
    "this model can be viewed as a model for two planes of strongly correlated electrons on a square lattice with on - site interaction and a hopping connecting corresponding sites of the two planes . at half filling with no interaction the metal - to - band insulator transition is driven by increasing the hopping between the two subsystems , i.  e. , the splitting of the bonding and antibonding bands produces a gap . in the case of no hopping between the planes , a mott transition is driven by increasing the on - site coulomb repulsion which localizes the electrons by suppressing the hopping between different sites .",
    "the overall scale of the problem is set by the hopping matrix element @xmath0 within the plane ( which we set to unity ) and the parameter differentiating between the mott and band insulator is the ratio of the hopping matrix element between the planes , @xmath1 , and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 .",
    "the approximation used in this work consists of letting the coordination number of the sites in each plane ( 4 ) to go to infinity .",
    "this model has been studied with dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approximation using iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "we study this model at finite temperature using qmc @xcite as impurity solver .",
    "also , first successful attempts to apply a more demanding continuous - time qmc algorithm to a simplified two - impurity problem already exist@xcite . here , the focus is on the nature of the transition from the mott insulator to the band insulator phase .",
    "we calculate the optical conductivity for direct comparison with experimental data . for other theoretical studies of low - dimensional coupled strongly correlated systems",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : first , we introduce the hamiltonian and present the solution method using dmft and the quantum monte carlo algorithm .",
    "we use these methods to determine the metal - to - insulator transition and calculate the phase diagram of the model at finite temperature . then we consider and analyze the numerical results , in particular the analytic continuation of the imaginary - time qmc data .",
    "we present detailed results for the single - particle spectral function and the optical conductivity close to the transition and analyze the behavior of these properties close to the transition .",
    "finally , we state our conclusions .",
    "the two - plane hubbard model with interplane hopping @xmath1 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 with @xmath4 denoting the annihilation operator for an electron / hole with spin component @xmath5 on site @xmath6 of the plane @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "this means electrons can move inside the planes as well as between corresponding sites on the two planes .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the coordination number of the lattice ( @xmath10 for two dimensions ) , ensuring a constant band width as the coordination number is taken towards infinity . using dynamical mean - field theory @xcite ,",
    "the two - plane system is reduced to two impurities self - consistently embedded in a bath : in order to calculate on - site ( local ) properties of the sites @xmath11 ( site @xmath6 of each of the planes ) , the self - energy @xmath12 is replaced by the local self - energy @xmath13 , leading to a two - impurity ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) problem given by the `` effective '' action    @xmath16\\nonumber\\\\ * & & = \\int{\\rm d}\\tau\\,{\\rm d}\\tau'\\,\\sum_{\\sigma\\alpha\\alpha ' } c^+_{0\\sigma\\alpha } ( \\tau){\\cal g}_{\\alpha\\alpha'}(\\tau,\\tau')^{-1 } c_{0\\sigma\\alpha'}(\\tau ' ) \\nonumber\\\\ * & & \\quad+u\\int{\\rm d}\\tau\\sum_\\alpha n_{0\\alpha\\uparrow}(\\tau ) n_{0\\alpha\\downarrow}(\\tau ) .",

    "@xmath17 is a @xmath18 matrix ; since the system is symmetric under exchange of the planes , we use @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; the properties of the system can be described by the symmetric / antisymmetric ( bonding / antibonding ) combinations of the two planes .",
    "this impurity problem is defined by the self - consistency equation @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the density of states ( dos ) for a free ( @xmath24 ) single - plane system , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the self - energy for the impurity problem , which can be calculated from the effective impurity action via the impurity green s function ( the mean - field approximation for the on - site lattice green s function ) .",
    "the self - sonsistency equation can be derived exactly following the lines given in the work by @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 is the only place where the detailed lattice structure enters the calculations , so the results are essentially independent of those details .",
    "the dmft equations are usually solved using an iteration algorithm consisting of two parts : by solving an impurity - like problem ( [ effectiveaction ] ) , the on - site green s function is determined , then , using the dmft self - consistency equation ( [ sce ] ) , a new impurity problem is defined .",
    "this is repeated until convergence has apparently been reached .",
    "we solve the two impurity problem using the quantum monte carlo algorithm developed by hirsch and fye @xcite . in order to use the monte carlo algorithm with",
    "the dmft effective action which is non - local with respect to imaginary time @xmath28 , the action @xmath29 has to be rewritten@xcite using a lattice hamiltonian consisting of auxiliary `` bath '' orbitals , replacing the `` bath '' green s function @xmath17 .    for initialization",
    ", we use a guess for the weiss fields , @xmath30 ( diagonal , i.  e. , connecting one site to itself ) and @xmath31 ( off - diagonal , i.  e. , connecting one site to the corresponding site on the other plane ) , determining the green s function of the lattice . using the qmc algorithm , the local imaginary - time green s functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are calculated , @xmath34 being the on - site green s function , whereas @xmath35 is again connecting two corresponding sites on different planes .",
    "use of the dyson equation then yields the self - energies @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "now , in order to use the self - consistency equation , we switch to the symmetric / antisymmetric combinations of the two planes , so the self - energy , the green s function , and the weiss field become diagonal @xmath18 matrices .",
    "since the kinetic energy is then diagonal as well , the free green s functions are the hilbert transforms of the density of states for the symmetric / antisymmetric combinations of the real - space planes without interaction : @xmath38 therefore the self - energy can be easily calculated using @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "now we can calculate the new weiss fields for the next iteration using the self - consistency equation ( [ sce ] ) .      using the electron spectral densities",
    "@xmath41 , we calculate the electron self - energy at real frequencies , @xmath42 . the spectral function for a non - vanishing momentum",
    "is then given to be @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the free - particle kinetic energy .",
    "the optical conductivity is , up to a constant , defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the current - current correlation function . as a function of the bosonic matsubara frequencies @xmath47 , in dmft for a hypercubic lattice , it is @xcite @xmath48 after continuation to real frequencies @xmath49 , the real ( non - dissipative ) part of the optical conductivity is , up to the constant @xcite @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 denoting the fermi function , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the inverse temperature .",
    "finally , the weight of the drude peak was determined by fitting a lorentz curve to the central peak ( the first five data points , corresponding to @xmath55 ) .",
    "the reason for the summation over symmetric and antisymmetric planes in eqns .",
    "( [ optcondbubble ] ) and ( [ optcond ] ) is the following : since the optical conductivity is defined as a long - wavelength limit , the momentum transferred by the optical conductivity has to vanish , viz .",
    "the in - plane component as well as the component perpendicular to the planes . the perpendicular component can assume just two values , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric orbitals , respectively .",
    "therefore , the optical conductivity at vanishing ( also perpendicular ) momentum is given by the product of green s functions both symmetric or both antisymmetric .",
    " in the limit of high dimension , inter - band transitions do not contribute to the optical conductivity , as they may only arise from interaction vertices .",
    "however , in that limit , the interaction only contributes to the optical conductivity via self - energy insertions in the single - particle green s function@xcite , quite regardless of the detailed band - index structure of the interaction vertex .",
    "the replacement of the gaussian free dos of the hypercubic lattice by a semicircular one ( which is the exact dos for an infinite - coordination bethe lattice ) is an ad - hoc approximation , which may be justified by the low weight of the gaussian tails and their unphysicality .",
    "however , eq . ( [ optcondbubble ] )",
    "was derived for a hypercubic lattice with gaussian dos , so , although we assume our results to be realistic , they still are based on a substantial approximation .",
    " for a detailed discussion of possible transport properties on a bethe lattice , please refer to @xcite .",
    "we consider the half - filled model ( @xmath58 ) at a temperature @xmath59 , using @xmath60 time slices of @xmath61 . as the density of states of the free ( @xmath24 ) uncoupled ( @xmath62 ) lattice",
    ", we use a semicircular @xmath63 , which becomes exact for electrons on a bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "this is more convenient than a gaussian dos for a hypercubic lattice , because the extended unphysical tails of the gauss distribution render it impossible to clearly define the metal - to - band insulator transition .    from the imaginary - time green s functions produced by the qmc algorithm ,",
    "the corresponding spectral densities for the symmetric / antisymmetric planes are extracted using the maximum - entropy method @xcite .",
    "we use a default model consisting of normalized semi - ellipses of half - width @xmath64 centered at @xmath65 for the symmetric and antisymmetric plane , resp . , plus a small flat `` background '' in order to keep the possibility to extract features outside this area .",

    "however , the latter one is usually smeared too strongly to be seen clearly@xcite , only for low values of @xmath1 , some traces of this peak might be recognized . with increasing @xmath1 ,",

    "the system is in a mott insulating state ; the metallic and insulating solutions are both locally stable within a coexistence region .",
    "as discussed below , no clear separation between the mott and the band insulating states were found .    in order to get some impression of the transition between the band insulating and the mott insulating phase",

    "the evolution of the lhb weight along the dotted line is shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] . for half filling ,",
    "the weight of the lhb for a purely band insulating phase is unity , for a purely mott insulating phase , it is close to @xmath100 .",
    "as can be seen the weight of the lhb does neither show some distinct kink nor vanish from a well - defined point .",
    "thus , this quantity does not yield any evidence for a phase transition between the mott - hubbard and the band insulating phase .",
    "we find a phase diagram which is clearly compatible to the zero - temperature phase diagram in @xcite , keeping in mind that @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "however , some differences ought to be noticed : the coexistence region is found at a lower @xmath2 value due to the finite temperature ( see , for comparison , the phase diagram in @xcite , where the same scale of @xmath2 is used as by @xcite ) ; the coexistence region has become smaller as well .",
    "a coexistence region thus clearly exists at a temperature of @xmath96 ; in contrast , at @xmath103 , no coexistence region was found any more .",
    " this behavior suggests that the critical temperature of the mott transition decreases as @xmath1 is increasing , see the sketch in fig .",
    "[ coexistence3d ] .",
    "the other clear difference is the slope of the transition line at low interaction @xmath2 , close to the band transition .",
    "we find , for low @xmath2 , the transition line to be at almost constant @xmath1 , whereas moeller et al .",
    "find a clear dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "we assume this is due to the temperature : as a finite temperature always smoothens a metal - to - band insulator transition , a small interaction driving the system to an insulating state can be compensated by thermal fluctuations . the re - entrance behavior seen in the ipt@xcite can not be resolved accurately in our calculation .",
    "the general shape of the phase boundary however suggests that a re - entrance behavior does not exist at the temperature considered . to resolve this issue definitely , lower temperatures have to be considered which are inaccessible to the hirsch - fye algorithm for the large-@xmath2 case .",
    "the comparatively@xcite high upper bound of the coexistence region may be due to the non - negligible trotter error in this region .",
    "the insulating solution will be much less sensitive to an increase in the @xmath104 term neglected by the trotter decomposition of the path integral than the metallic solution , which is why the upper bound shifts due to the truncation error , but not so much the lower bound , which is also at a lower @xmath2 value , so the second - order @xmath2 term neglected by the time discretization is smaller .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the spectral densities , the optical conductivities , and the drude weights of a two - plane hubbard model at low temperature for different values of the inter - plane coupling .",
    "we have located the different metal - to - insulator transitions ; however , no clear transition between the mott insulating phase and the band insulating phase could be found ; as well , the corresponding spectral weights show a continuous behavior .",
    "this observation is consistent with the assumption that there exists only a crossover between those two insulating phases , but no clear phase transition .",
    "the phase diagram is slightly different from the one found in @xcite , which comes as no surprise as we are considering a finite temperature shifting transition values and decreasing the coexistence region .",
    "three - dimensional phase diagram of the two - plane hubbard model , composed of the data in @xcite ( @xmath105 ) , @xcite ( @xmath62 ) , and this work .",
    "the dashed line indicates the shape of the coexistence region suggested by the data , which are indicated by the full lines ; thin lines indicate the metal - to - insulator transitions.,width=325 ]    we have discussed in detail spectral properties like , e.  g. , the optical conductivity , which is of some use to experimentalists .",
    "also , the use of a quantum monte carlo method means a serious technical improvement with respect to earlier studies , as it is a numerically exact method without the use of uncontrolled approximations .",
    "even though the use of a quantum mc algorithm @xcite means a technical advantage , the behavior of the system for very low temperatures could not be considered in this work .",
    "we plan to investigate lower temperatures using a very recently developed continuous - time quantum monte carlo algorithm @xcite , yielding the phase diagram at much lower temperatures and clarifying the evolution towards zero temperature .",
