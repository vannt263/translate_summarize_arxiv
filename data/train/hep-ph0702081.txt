    "radiative corrections to the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) vertex have long received considerable attention . apart from its sensitivity to new physics effects , this vertex has theoretical interest by its own as it may serve as a probe of the gauge sector of the standard model ( sm ) . in this context , the one - loop contributions to the @xmath6 vertex , which defines the static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath7 boson have been calculated in the sm @xcite and several of is extensions such as two - higgs doublet models ( thdms ) @xcite , supersymmetric models @xcite , 331 models @xcite , etc .",
    "similar attention has been paid to the study of the @xmath8 vertex . despite the attention",
    "has focused mainly on the static properties of the @xmath7 boson , a more comprehensive study of the @xmath7 boson properties requires the analysis of the off - shell @xmath4 vertex , particularly when the neutral @xmath9 boson is off - shell and the @xmath7 bosons are on - shell as the resulting vertex could be tested with high precision at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) or the planned future linear colliders .",
    "it is well known that although the on - shell @xmath4 vertex renders a gauge independent amplitude by itself , gauge independence is lost once any external particle goes off - shell , thereby requiring the use of a nonconventional calculation scheme .",
    "the difficulties to obtain a gauge independent green function for the @xmath0 vertex have long been known . in particular",
    ", a careless calculation of the radiative corrections to the @xmath0 vertex via a conventional gauge - fixing procedure irremediably leads to an ill - behaved gauge dependent green function .",
    "for instance , one - loop corrections to the @xmath0 vertex were first calculated in the sm by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite using the feynman-t hooft gauge via a conventional gauge - fixing scheme .",
    "the result was an infrared divergent green function that violates unitarity .",
    "aware of the fact that an off - shell green function is generally gauge dependent , authors of ref .",
    "@xcite invoked a diagrammatic method known as the pinch technique ( pt ) @xcite to obtain a gauge independent @xmath0 green function satisfying the requirements of gauge invariance and infrared finiteness .",
    "the pt exploits the fact that although the off - shell green functions are gauge dependent , the @xmath10-matrix elements to which they contribute are gauge independent . in this way ,",
    "order by order in perturbation theory , one can construct a gauge independent green function for an off - shell vertex by combining its contribution with all other feynman diagrams that also contribute to a particular physical process , thereby getting rid of any @xmath11 dependent terms . in this respect , while the @xmath0 vertex does not represent a physical process by its own , it can contribute to a gauge invariant physical process such as @xmath12 scattering . by this method , a gauge invariant and gauge independent @xmath0 green function can be constructed .",
    "the pt was also used in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the one - loop contributions to the @xmath0 vertex from the unconstrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the pt is thus a diagrammatic method that allows one to remove any unphysical gauge dependent term from an off - shell @xmath13-point function at the level of the feynman graphs contributing to a certain physical process , thereby yielding a well - behaved gauge - independent and gauge - invariant green function .",
    "the pt may turn itself , however , into a somewhat cumbersome task .",
    "there is also the alternative of removing any gauge dependent term at the level of the generating functional . in this respect , although the background field method ( bfm ) @xcite renders a gauge invariant quantum action , no mechanism has been found yet that allows one to obtain both gauge - invariant and gauge - independent green functions from the generating functional .",
    "eventually , a connection between the pt and the bfm has been found @xcite : it turns out that the gauge - invariant and gauge - independent green function obtained via the pt is exactly reproduced if it is calculated through the bfm using the feynman rules given in the feynman-t hooft gauge ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "although such a correspondence , which so far remains a puzzle , was first established at the one - loop level @xcite , it has been shown that it persists at all orders of perturbation theory @xcite . therefore , instead of using the pt",
    ", one can use the bfm feynman-t hooft gauge ( bfmfg ) to calculate gauge - independent off - shell amplitudes .",
    "along these lines , in ref .",
    "@xcite we calculated the one - loop contributions to the @xmath0 vertex from the gauge sector of the so called minimal 331 model @xcite . in order to construct a well - behaved gauge independent green function , rather than using the pt , we invoked an alternative method inspired in the bfm and brst symmetry @xcite , which is well suited to study the sensitivity of the @xmath0 vertex to the virtual effects of the new gauge bosons predicted by 331 models .",
    "we will follow a similar approach here to calculate the one - loop contributions from the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "although we will shortly describe the calculation scheme below , for more details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "331 models have been the source of great interest lately .",
    "recent studies within the framework of this class of theories have focused on neutrino physics @xcite , @xmath15 physics @xcite , higgs boson physics @xcite , bilepton physics @xcite , supersymmetric extensions @xcite , dark matter @xcite , cp violation @xcite , and theoretical aspects @xcite .",
    "models of this kind are based on the @xmath16 gauge symmetry @xcite and are unique in the sense that they require that all the 3 fermion families be summed up in order to cancel anomalies , in contrast with other models in which anomaly cancelation is achieved family by family . as a consequence ,",
    "331 models require that the number of fermion families be a multiple of 3 , the quark color number .",
    "this may suggest a solution to the family replication problem .",
    "apart from this feature , 331 models are interesting as they predict a pair of massive gauge bosons arranged in a doublet of the electroweak group .",
    "while the minimal 331 model predicts a pair of singly - charged @xmath17 and a pair of doubly - charged @xmath18 gauge bosons , the model with right - handed neutrinos predicts a pair of neutral no self - conjugate gauge bosons @xmath19 instead of the doubly - charged ones .",
    "these new gauge bosons are called bileptons since they carry two units of lepton number , thereby being responsible for lepton - number violating interactions @xcite .",
    "the neutral bilepton has been deemed a promising candidate in accelerator experiments since it may be the source of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the reason why the effects of the bileptons on the @xmath0 vertex are worth studying is because their couplings to the sm gauge bosons are rather similar to the sm gauge boson couplings .",
    "current bounds put the bilepton masses in the range of a few hundred gevs @xcite , which means that the bileptons may show up via their virtual effects in low - energy observables .",
    "this is an important reason to investigate the effect of these particles on the @xmath0 vertex .",
    "furthermore , due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) hierarchy , the splitting between the charged and neutral bilepton masses is bounded by @xmath20 , so the bilepton masses might be almost degenerate since they are expected to be heavier than @xmath20 .",
    "we will see below that this is particularly suited for our calculation method .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present a brief introduction to the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "a survey of the quantization method is presented in sec .",
    "iii along with a detailed discussion on the gauge fixing procedure for the bileptons , whereas sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the analytical results and the analysis .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a previous paper , we worked in the context of this model and calculated the static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath7 boson @xcite . also , the one - loop contributions to the static electromagnetic properties of the neutral no self - conjugate @xmath19 boson were calculated in ref .",
    "it was shown that the main contributions to the @xmath6 vertex arise from the gauge sector , i.e. from the bileptons , as the fermion sector does not contribute and the higgs sector gives a negligibly contribution quite similar to that arisen in a thdm @xcite . therefore , although for completeness we will present a short description of the main features of the model , the following discussion will be mainly focused on the gauge sector as it is the one which is expected to give the dominant contributions to the @xmath0 vertex .",
    "furthermore , we will see that our calculation scheme is suited to analyze the effects of the bileptons on the @xmath0 green function .    in the fermion sector of the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos ,",
    "leptons of the same generation are arranged in left - handed triplets and right - handed singlets , the same being true for each quark generation .",
    "apart from the introduction of right - handed neutrinos , there are three new quarks @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , which have the following electric charge @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in order to cancel the @xmath26 anomaly ,",
    "two quark families transform as @xmath26 antitriplets and the remaining one as a triplet . at the first stage of ssb , when the @xmath27 group is spontaneously broken into @xmath3 ,",
    "the new quarks get their masses and emerge as singlets of the electroweak group",
    ". consequently , they can not interact with the @xmath7 boson at the tree level .",
    "it follows that there is no contribution from the new quarks to the @xmath0 vertex at the one - loop level .",
    "as far as the scalar sector is concerned , several higgs sectors have been proposed in the literature to achieve the ssb in 331 models @xcite . as for the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos",
    ", it requires the simplest higgs sector of this class of theories @xcite , i.e. only three triplets of @xmath26 are required to reproduce the sm physics at the fermi scale :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath3 doublets with hypercharge -1 , 1 and -1 respectively .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the triplet @xmath35 breaks the @xmath27 group into @xmath3 at the @xmath36 scale , whereas @xmath37 and @xmath38 are meant to break @xmath3 into @xmath39 .    in the gauge sector",
    ", the model predicts the existence of five new gauge bosons : two singly charged @xmath17 , two neutral no self - conjugate @xmath19 , and a neutral self - conjugate @xmath15 .",
    "all these new gauge bosons and the new quarks as well acquire their masses at the @xmath36 scale . at this stage of ssb ,",
    "the @xmath15 boson emerges as a singlet of the electroweak group and so no interaction between the @xmath15 boson and the @xmath7 boson arises .",
    "however , in the following stage of ssb , at the fermi scale , the @xmath15 boson couples with the @xmath7 boson via the @xmath40 mixing angle . as a consequence , the @xmath15 contribution to the @xmath0 vertex will be proportional to the square of the @xmath40 mixing angle , which is highly suppressed according to the most recent experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "we will thus ignore this contribution in this work .",
    "in sharp contrast , the bileptons arise as a doublet of the electroweak group at the @xmath36 scale , which means that they couple to the sm gauge bosons in a rather peculiar way : due to the fact that the @xmath41 group is completely embedded in @xmath26 , the bileptons couplings to the sm gauge bosons have similar strength and lorentz structure than those of the sm gauge boson couplings themselves . these new interactions , which arise solely from the yang - mills sector , do not involve any mixing angle and are entirely determined by the @xmath41 coupling constant and the weak angle @xmath42 .    in the first stage of ssb ,",
    "the bilepton masses are degenerate : @xmath43 .",
    "however , when @xmath3 is broken down to @xmath39 , the bilepton masses degeneration is also broken .",
    "once the higgs kinetic - energy sector is diagonalized , there emerge the following mass - eigenstate fields :    @xmath44    with masses @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . the remaining three gauge fields @xmath48 , @xmath49,and @xmath50 define the self - conjugate mass eigenstates . from the above expressions ,",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the following upper bound on the bilepton masses splitting @xcite : @xmath51    therefore , the bilepton masses become nearly degenerate when they are much larger than @xmath52 . while in the minimal 331 model an upper bound on the bilepton masses of the order of 1 tev can be derived from the theoretical constraint @xmath53 @xcite , which is obtained from matching the gauge couplings constants at the @xmath54 breaking scale , in the version with right - handed neutrinos the corresponding bound is highly relaxed as the theoretical constraint is @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the yang - mills sector induces all the couplings we need to compute the bilepton contribution to the @xmath0 vertex , so we will devote particular attention to it .",
    "the respective lagrangian can be written as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 , being @xmath59 the structure constants associated with @xmath26 .",
    "when the mass eigenstate fields are introduced , the above lagrangian can be split into three @xmath3-invariant terms @xcite : @xmath60 while @xmath61 stands for the usual sm yang - mills lagrangian , @xmath62 comprises the interactions between the new gauge bosons and the sm ones .",
    "the latter lagrangian is the only one relevant for the present discussion and we will get back to it later . as for the last term , @xmath63 , it induces the couplings of the @xmath15 boson to the bileptons . at the one - loop level",
    "there are no contributions to the @xmath0 vertex induced by this lagrangian .    in order to calculate the one - loop correction to the @xmath0 vertex",
    ", we will introduce a @xmath3-covariant gauge - fixing procedure for the bileptons .",
    "this will be discussed in the following section .",
    "we now turn to present an overview of the quantization method used to obtain a gauge invariant and gauge independent green function for the @xmath0 vertex in the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this method , which is inspired in the bfm and brst formalism , was comprehensively discussed in our previous work @xcite and we refrain from presenting a detailed discussion here .    the bfm @xcite is a powerful tool that allows one to construct a gauge invariant quantum action out of which gauge invariant green functions can be obtained that are free of pathologies and satisfy simple ward identities . in a conventional quantization formalism , all the fields appearing in the action are quantized . in the bfm",
    ", the gauge fields are decomposed into a quantum field and a classical ( background ) field .",
    "while the quantum fields are integrated out , the background fields are treated as sources . as a result",
    ", the quantum fields can only appear as internal lines in loop diagrams , whereas the background fields appear as external lines . in principle , it is necessary to gauge - fix both the quantum and the classical fields in order to define @xmath10-matrix elements , but it is enough to gauge - fix the former to obtain off - shell green functions . in this respect , while gauge invariance with respect to the quantum fields is broken when they are gauge - fixed , this process leaves unaltered the gauge invariance with respect to the classical fields .",
    "the resulting green functions will be gauge invariant but they will still maintain the dependence on the gauge parameter that characterizes the gauge - fixing scheme used for the quantum fields .",
    "however , we can exploit the connection between the bfm and the pt to obtain a gauge invariant and gauge independent green function .",
    "we just need to use the bfm feynman rules given in the feynman-t hooft gauge .",
    "we will see below that our quantization method incorporates some features of the bfm .",
    "although gauge invariance with respect to the full theory is broken when a conventional quantization scheme is applied , one can still preserve the gauge invariance under a subgroup of the theory .",
    "this approach is well suited when the virtual effects of the gauge fields associated with the subgroup are expected to be considerably small . in this context ,",
    "following the philosophy of the effective lagrangian approach , where a @xmath3 effective lagrangian is constructed out of the light ( sm ) fields to assess the effects of the heavy fields on a low - energy observable , it would be convenient to analyze the virtual effects of the bileptons on the @xmath0 green function in a @xmath3-covariant manner .",
    "a quantization scheme for the bileptons would only be required since the sm gauge fields would only appear as external lines .",
    "thus , a @xmath3-invariant effective lagrangian can be constructed by introducing a @xmath3-covariant gauge - fixing procedure for the bileptons , which then can be integrated out .",
    "the gauge - fixing procedure must involve the @xmath3-covariant derivative given in the representation in which the heavy fields transform under this group , which is the reason why such gauges are known as nonlinear or covariant .",
    "this class of gauges have proved to be very useful for the calculation of radiative corrections in the sm and beyond @xcite .",
    "since we want to introduce a nonlinear gauge fixing procedure for the bileptons , we need to be careful as the difficulties to implement the faddeev - popov method ( fpm ) @xcite in such a case have long been known .",
    "more specifically , it is known that renormalizability becomes ruined when the fpm is applied to a nonlinear gauge .",
    "we can invoke instead the brst formalism @xcite to construct the most general renormalizable nonlinear gauge - fixing term @xcite .",
    "we will thus introduce a @xmath3-covariant gauge - fixing term for the bileptons , which will lead to an invariant quantum action out of which a gauge invariant @xmath0 green function will be obtained . invoking the connection between the pt and the bfm",
    ", the use of the feynman-t hooft feynman rules will render a gauge independent green function .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that both our quantization method and the bfm are meant to construct gauge - invariant quantum actions .",
    "the main difference resides in the fact that while the bfm allows one to analyze any new physics effects regardless the energy scale , ours is only appropriate to study heavy physics effects on low - energy ( sm ) green functions .",
    "this stems from the fact that while in the bfm gauge - invariance would be preserved with respect to the gauge group of a complete theory , in our quantization method there is only invariance under a subgroup of such a theory . in the case of the present paper ,",
    "our quantization method preserves gauge invariance under the @xmath3 group rather than @xmath27 .",
    "while the calculation will be greatly simplified because of electroweak invariance , the price to be paid is that our result will only be approximate as it will only account for the bilepton effects on the @xmath0 vertex at the @xmath36 scale , when the bilepton masses are still degenerate .",
    "we will see below that this is indeed a good approximation .",
    "the procedure to gauge - fix the yang - mills lagrangian of the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos is similar to that described in the case of the minimal 331 model .",
    "so , we refrain from presenting a detailed discussion here and refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .    after introducing the most general action for a yang - mills system consistent with brst symmetry and renormalization theory @xcite",
    ", we integrate out the auxiliary fields to obtain an action defined by the following gauge - fixed @xmath64-invariant lagrangian @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the gauge - fixing term and the ghost sector lagrangian , respectively . as for the yang - mills lagrangian @xmath68 , which is given in eq .",
    "( [ l_ym ] ) , for our calculation we only need the @xmath62 term as it is the only one that induces the interactions between the bileptons and the sm gauge bosons .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a doublet of the electroweak group with hypercharge @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the electroweak covariant derivative .",
    "we have also introduced the definitions @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the pauli matrices .    as for the gauge - fixing term @xmath66 and the ghost sector lagrangian @xmath67 , they can be written as @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the gauge - fixing functions and @xmath80 stands for the antighost fields . in addition , @xmath81 are the ghost fields associated with the @xmath82 fields , @xmath59 are the @xmath26 structure constants , and @xmath11 is the gauge parameter .",

    "the covariant structure of the gauge - fixing term becomes manifest when the mass eigenstates @xmath84 and @xmath85 are introduced in an @xmath3 doublet @xmath86 we will now decompose the gauge - fixing lagrangian into three terms in order to analyze the dynamics it induces : @xmath87 where each term is separately @xmath3 invariant : @xmath88\\nonumber \\\\ % & & -\\frac{g^2\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{1 - 4s^2_w}}{2\\sqrt{2}c_w}z'_\\mu(\\chi^{'0*}y^{\\mu % \\dag}\\phi_y+\\chi^{'0 } \\phi^\\dag_y y^\\mu)\\nonumber \\\\ % & & -\\frac{3g^2(1 - 4s^2_w)}{4c^2_w\\xi}z'_\\mu z'_\\nu y^{\\mu % \\dag}y^\\nu.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas the third term , denoted by @xmath89 , involves the @xmath15 boson and is irrelevant here .",
    "we note that the first term of @xmath90 defines the bilepton propagators and gives new contributions to the trilinear and quartic couplings involving the bileptons and the sm gauge bosons , which originally arise from the @xmath62 lagrangian .",

    "feynman diagrams for the @xmath4 vertex in the @xmath3-covariant gauge . the pseudo - goldstone bosons and ghosts contribute through an identical set of diagrams , but only the triangle ones give a nonvanishing contribution to @xmath155 and @xmath156.,width=384 ]    we emphasize that the above expressions account for the bilepton effects on the @xmath0 vertex at the @xmath36 scale , when the bilepton masses are degenerate and equal to @xmath191 .",

    "we now would like to analyze the behavior of @xmath156 and @xmath169 as functions of @xmath192 and the bilepton mass , which are the only free parameters which they depend on .",
    "as far as @xmath192 is concerned , we will focus on the values that can be at the reach of the future planned linear colliders as this vertex has the chance of being studied through @xmath193 scattering .",
    "we thus consider the range 200 gev @xmath194 2 tev @xcite .    as for the bilepton mass , it is convenient to give a short account on the existing bounds from both the theoretical and experimental sides",
    ". first of all , we already mentioned that in the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos the matching of the gauge couplings constants at the @xmath16 breaking scale requires that @xmath195 @xcite , from which an upper bound on the bilepton mass can be derived after considering radiative corrections to @xmath196 and the most recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "the respective bounds is somewhat weak and contrasts with the case of the minimal 331 model , which requires that @xmath197 tev @xcite for consistency with the theoretical bound @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , whereas the bileptons predicted by the minimal 331 model could be searched for via collider experiments in a near future , thereby confirming or ruling out the model , the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos would still leave open the door . we have also mentioned that because of the symmetry breaking hierarchy , the bilepton mass splitting is bounded by @xmath199 .",
    "this means that @xmath200 and @xmath201 can not be arbitrarily different .",
    "in fact , the heavier the bilepton masses , the closer its degeneracy .",
    "our approximation of mass degeneracy has thus much sense .",
    "we now would like to examine the lower bounds on the bilepton masses . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the data from neutrino neutral current elastic scattering give a lower bound on the mass of the new neutral gauge boson @xmath202 in the range of 300 gev , which along with the symmetry - breaking hierarchy yield @xmath203 gev .",
    "a similar bound was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the observed limit on the wrong muon decay @xmath204 , which leads to @xmath205 gev at 90% c.l .",
    "these lower bounds on @xmath206 are in agreement with that obtained from the latest bnl measurement on the muon anomaly @xcite .",
    "it is then reasonable to consider the range 200 gev @xmath207 2000 gev for our numerical analysis",
    ". this will allow us to assess the behavior of the form factors and get an estimate of their order of magnitude .",
    "a word of caution is in order here : it has been pointed out that some of the existing bounds on the bilepton masses are too model dependent and thus can be relaxed by considering extra assumptions @xcite , so a relatively light bilepton can not be ruled out yet .    in fig .",
    "[ figffqd ] we show the @xmath7 form factors @xmath169 and @xmath156 vs the center - of - mass energy @xmath208 , i.e. the momentum carried by the virtual @xmath9 boson , for the bilepton mass values @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of the @xmath7 form factors on the bilepton mass is shown in fig .",

    "[ figffqd ] it is clear that both @xmath156 and @xmath155 are of the order of about @xmath215 for a relatively light bilepton with a mass of 200 gev and a center - of - mass energy around the energy threshold @xmath216 , where the form factors reach their extremum values and develop an imaginary part . below this threshold ,",
    "the form factors are purely real , which reflects the fact that the bileptons that couple to the @xmath9 boson are necessarily virtual , whereas the direct production of a bilepton pair becomes possible for energies @xmath217 .",
    "although the direct production of a bilepton pair would be preferred over the search for their virtual effects , the latter would be useful for a high precision test of the @xmath4 vertex .",
    "we can also see that the form factors decrease by one order of magnitude when @xmath218 gev and by two orders of magnitude when @xmath219 gev , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figffmd ] .",
    "for very high energies , the form factors have a good behavior as they approach zero asymptotically after reaching an extremum value above @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , unitarity is respected , which stems from the fact that the @xmath4 green function that we have obtained is gauge invariant . in fig .",
    "[ figffqd ] we can also observe that , except for the reversed sign , the curves for @xmath156 and @xmath169 are very similar . for a relatively light bilepton both form factors are of about the same order of magnitude , but the magnitude of @xmath156 decreases more quickly as @xmath191 increases .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those obtained in the sm and some of its extensions .",
    "as far as the sm is concerned , the gauge boson contribution to the @xmath156 form factor is of the order of @xmath220 for @xmath214 in the range @xmath221 gev , whereas @xmath156 is about one order of magnitude below @xcite .",
    "these contributions are of the same order of magnitude than those of the fermion and scalar sectors of the theory @xcite .",
    "as far as supersymmetric models are concerned , the total contribution from the unconstrained mssm is about the same order of magnitude or larger than the sm total contribution for some set of the values of the parameters of the model @xcite .",
    "our results in the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos and relatively light bileptons , with a mass around 200 gev , is of the same order of magnitude than the sm contribution .",
    "these results are similar to those obtained in the minimal 331 model @xcite and other weakly coupled theories .",
    "unless a very high precision is achieved in future particle colliders , it would be very hard to discriminate the contributions form different models to the @xmath4 vertex .",
    "however , testing this vertex would still be useful for probing some particular model once it has been confirmed by experimental data .",
    "we have used a nonconventional quantization method inspired on the bfm and brst symmetry to analyze the effects of the new gauge bosons ( bileptons ) predicted by the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos on the of - shell @xmath0 vertex .",
    "hopefully , this class of effects might be searched for at a future linear collider through @xmath222 scattering . in particular , it has been pointed out that clic would reach a sensitivity of about @xmath215 in the measurement of the so called form factors , @xmath156 and @xmath169 , characterizing the @xmath0 vertex @xcite . following the philosophy of the bfm",
    ", our method considers the bileptons as quantum fields and the sm gauge bosons as classical fields .",
    "a nonlinear @xmath3 invariant gauge - fixing is then introduced for the bileptons , which are integrated out in the generating functional .",
    "the result is a quantum action defined by a @xmath3 invariant lagrangian effective lagrangian is constructed out of the sm fields to analyze the virtual effects of the heavy fields , which have been integrated out . ] out of which a gauge invariant and gauge independent green function can be obtained . to this end , we made use of the link between the diagrammatic method known as the pt and the bfm , which establishes that the gauge invariant and gauge independent green function obtained via the pt coincides with that obtained via the bfm as long as the feynman-t hooft gauge feynman rules are used when calculating the latter .",
    "we emphasize that our method is only approximate as the quantum action is only invariant under @xmath3 rather than @xmath27 .",
    "this method is suited to analyze the bilepton effects at the @xmath27 breaking scale , when their masses are still degenerate .",
    "the advantages of our calculation scheme are twofold : the introduced nonlinear gauge - fixing term for the bileptons allows one to remove several unphysical vertices , which in turn allows one to get rid of several feynman diagrams ; on the other hand , preserving the electroweak invariance turn the calculation into a simple task as each sector of the theory gives a gauge invariant contribution satisfying simple ward identities by its own .",
    "once our method was applied , we obtained the form factors @xmath156 and @xmath169 , which were analyzed for several values of the bilepton mass and convenient values of the momentum carried by the virtual @xmath9 boson .",
    "it was found that the bilepton effects on the @xmath0 vertex are of the same order of magnitude than the sm and the minimal 331 model contributions , provided that the bilepton mass is of the order of a few hundred of gevs .",
    "for very heavy bileptons , the respective contribution to the @xmath0 is negligibly small .",
    "this indicates that it will be very hard to discriminate between different class of effects on the @xmath0 vertex arising from distinct models .",
    "however , if a high precision is achieved in future linear colliders , the @xmath0 vertex might serve as a probe to some particular model by then confirmed by other experimental data .",
    "the good behavior of the form factors at high energies was also discussed , for it is a reflect of the gauge invariance and gauge independence of the @xmath0 green function obtained via our quantization method .",

    "<S> in a recent paper @xcite , we investigated the effects of the massive charged gauge bosons ( bileptons ) predicted by the minimal 331 model on the off - shell vertex @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) using a @xmath3 covariant gauge - fixing term for the bileptons . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed along the same lines and calculate the effects of the gauge bosons predicted by the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the bilepton effects on the @xmath0 vertex are of the same order of magnitude than those arising from the sm and several of its extensions , provided that the bilepton mass is of the order of a few hundred of gevs . for heavier bileptons , </S>",
    "<S> their effects on the @xmath0 vertex are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the form factors at high energies is also discussed as it is a reflect of the gauge invariance and gauge independence of the @xmath0 green function obtained via our quantization method . </S>"
