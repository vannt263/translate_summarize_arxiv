    "this immediately leads to a number of relations @xmath14 with those one can derive @xmath15    the two - point functions @xmath16 are themselves not directly observable .",
    "however , the vector current two - point function in qcd satisfies a once subtracted dispersion relation @xmath17 the imaginary part can be measured in hadron production if there exists an external vector boson like @xmath18 or the photon coupling to the current .",

    "@xmath20 depends on the precise definitions used in regularizing the product of two currents in the same space - time point .",
    "the two - point functions for the electromagnetic current can be determined in @xmath21 collisions and @xmath22 in @xmath23-decays .",

    "if we only add the singlet vector current , in addition to simply extending the external vector field to include the singlet part , there are two extra terms relevant at order @xmath4 : @xmath31 since we are only interested in two - point functions of vector currents these will always appear in the combination @xmath32 .",
    "for the two - flavour case we get @xmath33 and @xmath34 but otherwise similar terms .",
    "it should be noted that none of the terms in the extended @xmath4 lagrangian contains couplings of the singlet vector - field to the gb .",
    "the singlet appearing in commutators vanishes and the terms involving field strengths vanish , except for the combinations above which do not contain gb fields .    at order @xmath3",
    "there are many more terms , specifically there are terms appearing that contain interactions of the singlet vector field with the gbs .",
    "two examples are @xmath35 the extra terms that contribute to the vector two - point function at order @xmath3 always contain two field strengths and the extra @xmath30 needed can come from either two derivatives or quark masses .",
    "setting all gb fields to zero , the only possible extra terms have a structure with @xmath36 the vector - field field strength and @xmath37 the quark mass part of @xmath38 .",

    "in addition there are also extra counterterms for the singlet current appearing .",
    "the results are @xmath58",
    "if we look at the flavour content of the two - point functions in the isospin limit , it is clear that @xmath22 only contains connected contributions while @xmath59 only contains disconnected contributions .",
    "this is derived by thinking of which quark contractions can contribute as shown in fig .",

    "their result is in our terms expressed via @xmath67 which is clearly satisfied for the results shown in ( [ resultnf2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath20 , via the part coming from the lecs , does not satisfy a similar relation due to the extra terms possible for the singlet current .",
    "inspection of ( [ resultnf2 ] ) shows that the loop part at order @xmath3 also satisfies ( [ relnf2 ] ) but due to the part of the lecs , the relation is no longer satisfied even for the subtracted functions @xmath24 .",
    "the relation ( [ relnf2 ] ) can be derived in more general way . as noted in sect .",
    "[ chpt ] the singlet current @xmath68 only couples to gbs at order @xmath3 or at order @xmath4 via the wzw term and we need at least two of the latter for the vector two - point function . for the contributions where those couplings are not present , denoted by a tilde , we get @xmath69 the relation ( [ relprimenf2 ] ) if written for @xmath24 has corrections at order @xmath70 .",
    "( [ relprimenf2 ] ) together with ( [ relpiu ] ) immediately leads to ( [ relnf2 ] ) but for many more contributions .",
    "the ratio of disconnected to connected is @xmath2 for all loop - diagrams only involving vertices from the lowest - order lagrangian or from the normal nlo lagrangian .",
    "so the ratio is true for a large part of all higher order loop diagrams and corrections start appearing only in loop diagrams at order @xmath70 with one insertion from the @xmath3-lagrangian or at @xmath71 with two insertions of a wzw vertex .",
    "the argument includes diagrams with four or more pions .    using the isospin relations",
    "we can derive that @xmath72 looking at ( [ reliso ] ) , one can see that the ratio @xmath73 is exact for all contributions with isospin @xmath74 and only broken due to @xmath75 contributions .",
    "this can be used as well to estimate the size of the ratio , see below and @xcite .",
    "a corollary is that two - pion intermediate state contributions obey ( [ relnf2 ] ) to all orders .    the contributions to order @xmath3 for @xmath24 satisfy the relation ( [ relprimenf2 ] ) up to the lec contributions .",
    "using resonance saturation , the lecs can be estimated from @xmath76 and @xmath77 exchange . in the large @xmath78 limit that combination will only contribute to the connected contribution .",
    "since the @xmath76-@xmath77 mass splitting and coupling differences are rather small , we expect that the disconnected contribution from this source will be rather small .",
    "this will lower the ratio of disconnected to connected contributions compared to ( [ relnf2 ] ) .    in @xcite",
    "it was also noticed that the ratio of @xmath2 is valid for all two - pion intermediate states in the isospin limit .",
    "they used the slow turn - on of the three - pion channel where the singlet starts contributing to argue for the validity of the one - loop estimate . that slow turn - on follows from the three - pion contribution being @xmath71 in our way of looking at it . in @xcite the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 measured masses and couplings were used to obtain an estimate of the disconnected contribution of about @xmath79 .",
    "we consider that contribution to be within the error of our estimate given in sect .",
    "[ estimatedisconnected ] .",
    "it was already noted in @xcite that kaon loops violate the relation ( [ relnf2 ] ) in nlo three - flavour chpt and the same is rather visible in the results ( [ resultp4 ] ) and ( [ resultp6 ] ) .",
    "the argument for the singlet current coupling to mesons is just as true in three- as in two - flavour chpt .",
    "however here one needs to use the three - flavour singlet current , @xmath80 , instead .",
    "again denoting with a tilde the contributions from loop diagrams involving only lowest order vertices or nlo vertices not from the wzw term , we have ( after using isospin ) two relations similar to ( [ relprimenf2 ] ) @xmath81 note that in this subsection we talk about the three - flavour chpt expressions . inspection of the expressions in ( [ resultp4 ] ) and ( [ resultp6 ] ) show that the relations ( [ relprimenf3 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "note that the relation ( [ relprimenf3 ] ) if written for @xmath24 has corrections at order @xmath70 .",
    "in general we can write using ( [ relprimenf3 ] ) @xmath82 this indicates that corrections to the @xmath2 are expected to be small due to the strange quark being much heavier than the up and down quarks .",
    "the second relation in ( [ relprimenf3 ] ) allows a relation involving two - point functions with the strange quark current .",
    "note that a consequence of ( [ relprimenf3 ] ) in the equal mass limit is @xmath83 in this case the disconnected contribution to the electromagnetic two - point function vanishes identically since the charge matrix is traceless .",
    "in order to estimate the ratio of disconnected to connected contributions in chpt the inputs that appear must be determined . for the plots shown below we use @xmath84 the values for the decay constant and masses",
    "are standard ones .",
    "the values for the @xmath85 were recently reviewed in @xcite and we have taken the values for @xmath86 from @xcite quoted in @xcite .",
    "if we only consider @xmath24 , the only other lecs we need are @xmath87 and @xmath88 . as first suggested in @xcite lecs",
    "are expected to be saturated by resonances . for @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "the main contribution will be from the vector resonance multiplet . here",
    "a nonet approach typically works well and that would suggest that @xmath89",
    ". we will set it to zero in our estimates .",
    "the value for @xmath87 was first determined using resonance saturation in @xcite with a value of @xmath90 if we use resonance saturation for the nonet and the constraints from short - distance as used in @xcite we obtain for the two - point function @xmath91 assuming that the pure lec parts reproduce ( [ pivmd ] ) , leads to the value @xmath92 with @xmath93  mev . finally fitting the expression for @xmath94 to a phenomenological form of the two - point function @xcite",
