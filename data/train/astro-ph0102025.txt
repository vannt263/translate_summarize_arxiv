    "with the advent of numerous 10m - class telescopes , adaptive optics , and high-@xmath2 galaxy surveys , it is becoming possible to learn about the detailed properties of galaxies at high @xmath2 . in the future , we may expect improved ir sensitivity with ngst and 30 m or even 100 m telescopes , and this should usher in an era of high - precision kinematic and photometric studies of high-@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "disk galaxies are particularly important to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , as they are believed to undergo a relatively smooth formation process , and possibly serve as building blocks in the formation of other galactic systems through mergers .",
    "many authors have investigated galactosynthesis models ( e.g. , ) in which the properties of disk galaxies are determined primarily by the mass , size , and angular momenta of the halos in which they form , and which may contain the effects of supernova feedback , adiabatic disk contraction , cooling , merging , and a variety of star - formation ( sf ) recipes . in an earlier paper , we (; hereafter bjk ) , investigated a variety of galactosynthesis models with realistic stellar populations and made multi - wavelength predictions for the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation . with reasonable values for various cosmological parameters ,",
    "spin ( @xmath3 ) distributions , formation - redshift ( @xmath4 ) distributions , and no supernova feedback , we could produce an excellent fit to the local tf relation at all investigated wavelengths ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) , as well as to @xmath5-band tf data at @xmath9 , and to the surface - brightness  magnitude ( @xmath10-@xmath11 ) relation locally and at @xmath12 .",
    "these successes suggest that our simplified approach captures the essential phenomenology , even if it leaves out some of the details of more sophisticated models .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the high-@xmath2 tf predictions for our model .",
    "we examine the key factors impacting the tf relation at high @xmath2 , and demonstrate that degeneracies among parameters in galactosynthesis models at @xmath1 can be disentangled at high @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , information about the @xmath4 and @xmath3 distributions , as well as the sf history and baryon fraction in the disk , can be gleaned from the high-@xmath2 tf relation .",
    "here , we briefly review the main ingredients of our model and refer the interested reader to bjk for a comprehensive description . we use the spherical - collapse model for halos , the distribution of halo - formation times from the merger - tree formalism @xcite , and a joint distribution in @xmath3 and @xmath13 , the peak height @xcite .",
    "halos are treated as isothermal spheres with a fixed baryon fraction and specific angular momentum , and their embedded gaseous disks , assumed to form at virialization , have an exponential density profile .",
    "we implicitly assume that the halos of spiral galaxies form smoothly , rather than from major mergers ( bjk ; ) .",
    "an empirical schmidt law relates the star - formation rate ( sfr ) to the disk surface density @xcite . a salpeter initial mass function , a prescription for chemical evolution , and a synthetic stellar - population code @xcite provide the photometric properties of disks at any @xmath2 .",
    "the model is defined by cosmological parameters and by the time when the most massive progenitor contains a fraction @xmath14 of the present - day mass , when a halo is defined to form .",
    "we found that excellent agreement with current data was obtained by our model a , a cobe - normalized @xmath15cdm cosmogony ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) with @xmath19 .",
    "the tf relation in this model relied on both halo properties and sf in the disk .",
    "the local tf scatter arose primarily from the @xmath4 distribution , and secondarily from chemical evolution and the @xmath13-@xmath3 anticorrelation . in this model ,",
    "disk formation occurs primarily at @xmath20 and the tf slope steepens and the zero points get fainter from @xmath1 to @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the amount of gas expelled from or poured into a disk galaxy in this model is relatively small and the disk and halo specific angular momenta are equal .",
    "a suite of other models that give good fits to the observations at low @xmath2 , can also be found .",
    "to illustrate , we examine two alternatives that yield comparably good fits to the slope , zero - point , _ and _ scatter of the tf relation at @xmath1 in @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the first is a cdm model with @xmath21 , @xmath17 , constant metallicity given by the solar value , @xmath22 for all disks , a power - spectrum amplitude @xmath23 , an empirical shape parameter @xmath24 , and @xmath19 .",
    "high-@xmath25 models generally produce disk galaxies too faint to lie on the local tf relation . to compensate for this , we assume @xmath26 , and thus term this the high-@xmath27 model .",
    "our second alternative is a @xmath15cdm cosmogony like model a , but with metallicity held constant at the solar value , @xmath22 for all disks , and @xmath28 .",
    "this results in a narrow distribution of formation times peaked around @xmath29 ( for @xmath30-type disks ) , with appreciable ongoing formation today and almost no halos forming earlier than @xmath9 ( cf .",
    ", figure 1 of bjk ) .",
    "we thus denote this the low-@xmath4 model .",
    "this model will produce extremely young and bright disks ( cf .",
    ", figure 5 of bjk ) . ] . to compensate for this ,",
    "we reduce the efficiency of sf in our schmidt - law prescription by 50% [ see equations ( 2)(4 ) in bjk ] .",
    "this lower sf efficiency is plausible given a possible inconsistency between the model - a predictions for the absolute disk gas fractions and those observed ( see bjk for details ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] depicts the @xmath1 predictions for the a , high-@xmath27 , and low-@xmath4 models , in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 bands .",
    "the open symbols represent extinction - corrected data from . in each plot , the data are fit to the corresponding model , and @xmath31 gives the probability for the data given the model . since the data have excluded spirals that show evidence of merger activity or disruption , we exclude from our predictions those galaxies with @xmath32 .",
    "each of the three models yields a reasonable fit to the slope and normalization of the tf relation in all wavebands .",
    "moreover , the predicted scatter in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 bands roughly agrees with the observed values of 0.50 , 0.41 , 0.40 , and 0.41 , respectively , with the largest discrepancies occurring in the bluer bands , for reasons discussed in bjk .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows predictions for our a and high-@xmath27 models at @xmath0 . at this @xmath2 , the low-@xmath4 model fails to form disks . in the left - hand panels ,",
    "the points for a given mass scatter in a nearly vertical direction in contrast to the more horizontal scatter in the @xmath1 results ( see bjk figure 13 ) , particularly in redder bands . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the tf scatter arises primarily from the spread in @xmath4 , with the earliest - forming objects of a fixed mass having higher circular velocities .",
    "this is because for an evolved galaxy that has converted most of its gas to stars , the light from giants serves as a faithful tracer of the total mass , regardless of the precise age of the galaxy .",
    "as one goes either to higher masses in a given waveband , or to bluer bands at a fixed mass , the scatter in the local tf relation for a fixed mass does begin to curve upward ( i.e. , later - forming disks appear brighter ) to form a magnitude peak, since in both cases one becomes increasingly biased towards younger , brighter systems .    at @xmath0 ,",
    "the scatter still owes mainly to the spread in @xmath4 , and figure [ fig2 ] still indicates that at @xmath0 , the very earliest - forming objects do possess somewhat higher circular velocities for a given mass .",
    "( note in the left panels the peak of points formed at the high-@xmath34 end of the four scatter plots for the different masses . ) the galaxies that populate the tf relation at @xmath35 , however , are the small minority that constitute the exponentially decaying high-@xmath2 tail of the adopted @xmath4 distribution ( bjk figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , the formation of these halos spans a very short epoch , so that halos of a given mass will have roughly the same @xmath34 , resulting in the tight horizontal scatter for each mass .",
    "the large vertical scatter arises from the fact that , though these galaxies will eventually form the lower envelope of the present - day tf relation , comprising the oldest and ( in bluer bands ) faintest objects of a given mass , at @xmath0 even the least massive of these galaxies are typically no older than a few hundred million years , and the more massive systems younger still .",
    "thus , systems on the young side of the @xmath11 peak have formed so close to the epoch of observation that they simply have not had sufficient time to build up appreciable stellar populations ; given their high gas fractions and sfrs , even a small increase in their age results in a substantial increase in their stellar luminosity .    at high @xmath2 , disks with circular velocities 200500 km s@xmath36 ( masses @xmath37 @xmath38 )",
    "correspond to rare fluctuations .",
    "still , at these @xmath2 , one does expect to find several such objects within the horizon in a @xmath15cdm cosmogony , and since these will be the brightest objects in the sample , we include them in the discussion here .",
    "we also reiterate that the disks that form at @xmath35 are not the dominant population of disks at @xmath1 , as most disks at @xmath1 probably formed at @xmath20 ( see , e.g. , bjk ) .",
    "disks forming at higher @xmath2 will delineate the lower envelope of the tf relation at @xmath1 ; for a given mass , these older , higher-@xmath34 systems will be fainter since they will be the first to run out of fuel .",
    "the trend of steeper tf slopes and fainter zero - points in going from @xmath1 to @xmath9 is seen to continue here out to @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , in the @xmath5 band , the @xmath0 tf relation goes from @xmath39 mag brighter than its local counterpart at @xmath40 to less than 1 mag brighter at @xmath41 . in @xmath8 ,",
    "the high-@xmath2 prediction is about 1 mag fainter at @xmath41 and comparable to the local prediction at @xmath42 .",
    "this is because for fixed @xmath34 , halos at high @xmath2 will be younger , smaller , and have lower @xmath3 than halos today . in massive systems",
    "most of the sf activity takes place at early times .",
    "thus , younger systems will be significantly brighter , particularly in bluer bands , even though much of their gas remains unprocessed .",
    "smaller , low-@xmath34 systems , on the other hand , do not convert gas to stars as rapidly and are thus fainter than their local counterparts .",
    "the _ overall _ a - model @xmath5-band scatter in the high-@xmath2 tf relation is comparable to that at @xmath1 . in @xmath8 , however , the scatter at @xmath0 has increased by a factor of two .",
    "moreover , the variation in the tf scatter among different wavebands is not as great at high @xmath2 as was seen in the local case .",
    "this is because ( a ) disks at @xmath43 are likely to be in a starburst - dominated phase since there is very little cosmological time for even single stellar populations to decay ; ( b ) at such early times the spread in mass of gas turned into stars is very large for different @xmath4 and @xmath3 [ see eq . ( 7 ) of ] .",
    "therefore , it seems natural that all bands reflect the maximum possible spread .",
    "by contrast , there is little change in tf scatter from @xmath1 to @xmath9 , as the majority of galaxies are sufficiently evolved by @xmath9 ( figures 13 and 14 in bjk ) .",
    "furthermore , the scatter obtained here should be considered as an upper limit since , in practice , @xmath11-limited surveys may not detect arbitrarily young , and therefore faint , objects , particularly at lower masses .",
    "yr  corresponding to the timescale for giant - molecular cloud destruction ( e.g. , ) that effectively dictates the faintest objects at a given mass , and therefore the maximum possible scatter .",
    "] however , different realizations of a given model can generally produce results that vary by @xmath44 mag in the tf scatter .",
    "given the simplifying assumptions of the model , attention should be paid to the overall magnitudes of and relative differences between the slopes , normalizations , and scatters , rather than their precise values .",
    "in bjk , we also noted the slight reduction in tf scatter at @xmath1 in model a arising from the existence of a weak anticorrelation of @xmath3 with @xmath13 , and thus with @xmath4 .",
    "this reduction in tf scatter was only about 0.15 mag in @xmath5 and @xmath45 mag in @xmath8 for model a , and lesser or no effect was seen in some other possibly viable models . to investigate the effect of the joint @xmath3-@xmath13 distribution",
    ", we re - ran the models in figure [ fig2 ] with @xmath22 for all halos .",
    "this produces tf predictions with shallower slopes and brighter zero - points .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath22 value is higher ( lower ) than the full model would typically assign to high - mass ( lower - mass ) galaxies , which thus become correspondingly fainter ( brighter ) in the fixed-@xmath3 model . more interestingly , using a fixed @xmath3 at high @xmath2 _ reduced _ the overall tf scatter by about 0.2 mag in all bands at @xmath0 , as compared with using the joint distribution in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this is in direct contrast to the @xmath1 case , where a fixed @xmath3 produced a comparable or larger scatter , as described above .",
    "this is due to the vertical nature of the scatter in the tf for a fixed mass at high @xmath2 . in this case , higher-@xmath3 systems are still fainter , but their lower @xmath4 ( already confined to only a narrow range ) can only further scatter them to lower luminosities , not to lower @xmath34 as is in the local case , thereby increasing the scatter .",
    "this suggests that the scatter in the tf relation at high @xmath2 could be used to gauge the strength of the actual @xmath3-@xmath4 anticorrelation .",
    "figure  [ sb ] shows the surface - brightness  magnitude relation at @xmath12 and @xmath0 for the a and high-@xmath27 models , the dots are from 2df @xcite , and the open triangles from the hdf @xcite ; the latter have @xmath46 .",
    "since our model does not include a bulge component , the predicted @xmath10 may underestimate observed values if the disk and bulge components can not be resolved .    for model a , the slope of the relation at @xmath0 is slightly shallower than the local relation , with @xmath10 nearly identical to the low-@xmath2 case for @xmath47 and fainter by about 1 mag for @xmath48 .",
    "thus , at these scales , the trend towards higher luminosities and smaller disk scale lengths is offset by cosmological @xmath10 dimming .",
    "a more drastic contrast is seen in the high-@xmath27 model , where the predicted @xmath10 at the bright end varies by almost 4 magnitudes .",
    "this owes largely to substantial brightening that occurs at late times as the high baryon fraction is converted into starlight .    for both models , we find that the scatter at @xmath49 is much tighter than for the local case because the spread in the radii of disks at @xmath43 is smaller than at low @xmath2 .",
    "for example , at @xmath50 , disk sizes span a range roughly between 1 and 100 kpc , while at @xmath51 they range only from about 0.5 to 15 kpc in size . on the other hand ,",
    "the respective spreads in @xmath11 differ by no more than a factor of two .",
    "the small spread in the relation then reflects the small spread in disk sizes predicted in our adopted structure - formation scenario .",
    "thus , it will be interesting to learn whether this narrow spread is in fact observed at high @xmath2 .",
    "if a much wider spread is observed , this might indicate that either disks at @xmath43 are more substantially affected by merger activity or that they are simply larger ; i.e. , the spread in sizes predicted by our simple isothermal spherical - collapse model with angular - momentum conservation is simply too narrow .",
    "note that the @xmath10 predictions in general are more sensitive to assumptions regarding @xmath3 than are tf predictions , thus providing a strong complementary constraint on this aspect of the model .",
    "we now address how high-@xmath2 predictions can be used to distinguish among galactosynthesis models that are degenerate at @xmath1 .",
    "the right panels of figure [ fig2 ] show tf predictions for the high-@xmath27 model . at these mass scales ,",
    "the low-@xmath4 model predicts essentially no disks ( and thus no tf relation ) to be present at @xmath0 , certainly a drastically different prediction than that of the other models , despite their close agreement at @xmath1 .",
    "the precise slopes and zero - points for the a and high-@xmath27 models differ more appreciably than in the @xmath1 case , with the latter model yielding predictions that are significantly fainter at these scales .",
    "this owes both to the different normalizations of the fluctuation spectrum in the two models , and to the fact that the lower sf efficiency in the high-@xmath27 model results in fainter disks at early times .",
    "more importantly , the predicted tf scatter in the high-@xmath27 model is substantially less than that of the a model . this is because ( a ) a higher value of @xmath25 implies a narrower age range for disks forming at @xmath49 ; and ( b ) the scatter due to a spread in @xmath3 is excluded in this model .",
    "alternatively , one could envision a high-@xmath4 model in which disks were somehow brightened at later times , perhaps through late infall of fresh gas . in this case",
    ", there might be galaxies that are reasonably evolved , even at these high @xmath2 , so that many galaxies would be found on the old side of the @xmath11 peak .",
    "thus , the tf scatter for a fixed mass for such objects would more closely resemble that of figure [ fig1 ] , rather than the more vertically - oriented scatter of figure [ fig2 ] , and presumably also lead to a smaller overall tf scatter . the differences among the high-@xmath2 predictions explored here for the tf relation and its scatter amount to about 12 mag , and 0.20.4 mag , respectively , so these models should be distinguishable with high significance given data of the type in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the model predictions for the @xmath10-@xmath11 relation can also be used to address the degeneracy . in figure  [ sb ]",
    ", we see that , owing to the large scatter , the two models are difficult to distinguish on the basis of low-@xmath2 predictions , but the tightness of the predicted relation at higher @xmath2 , if in fact observed , would make this test a much more powerful discriminator .",
    "we have presented high-@xmath2 predictions for the tf relation , which may help to discriminate among different scenarios for galaxy formation .",
    "the evolution of the spread in the tf relation can probe the spread in halo @xmath4 , as well as sf processes in the disk . specifically , for observations of evolved systems at redder wavelengths , the scatter essentially decouples from the luminosity axis , while observations at high @xmath2 and/or in bluer bands are more sensitive to the disk s age , resulting in a scatter that couples more closely to the luminosity axis of the tf relation . the predicted @xmath10 for a given @xmath11 are fainter and tighter at high @xmath2 than at low @xmath2 .",
    "our models assume that galaxies in the high-@xmath2 universe are those in the high-@xmath4 tail of the present - day distribution .",
    "the circular speeds we predict are those for the disk , and so far it has proven difficult to extract these reliably from general sf population at @xmath9 .",
    "recent data seem to suggest that beyond the local universe , `` normal '' galaxies actively form stars primarily in their small cores ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "linewidth measurements of sf galaxies at @xmath9 and @xmath0 are found to effectively sample only the core dispersion , yielding typical values of roughly 80 km s@xmath36 with a scatter of about 2030 km s@xmath36 over a range of several magnitudes . unless improved measurements can succeed in sampling the disk at larger radii ( or at some other means of tracing the potential ) , a proper tf relation may not be easily defined .",
    "progress might be made by focusing on the lower , red envelope of the tf relation , rather than attempting to fill in the tf plane .",
    "the locus of the oldest and reddest points in the tf plane generally lie themselves on a well - defined line that serves as the high-@xmath4 envelope to the relation .",
    "samples of these old , red objects might be easier to construct than complete tf samples , which include young , starbursting objects that may have arbitrarily low luminosities falling off on the younger side of the @xmath11 peak .",
    "sirtf and ngst will have the sensitivity to detect some of the reddest objects in the sky , even out to high @xmath2 .",
    "if so , a comparison of the red envelope formed by these old objects with predictions , could suffice to constrain many of the key aspects of galactosynthesis models without needing to populate the entire tf plane .",
    "of course , the effects of dust will need to be taken into account to so that young , dusty systems are distinguished from old galaxies .",
