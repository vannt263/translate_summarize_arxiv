    "[ sec : introduction ]    spiral waves are a type of self - organization observed in a large variety of spatially extended , thermodynamically non - equilibrium systems of physical , chemical and biological nature  @xcite , where wave propagation is supported by a source of energy stored in the medium . if the system can be considered spatially uniform and isotropic and its properties do not depend on time , the corresponding mathematical models possess corresponding symmetries . for many practical applications ,",
    "a considerable interest is in non - stationary dynamics of spiral waves , which is usually defined separately either as drift , which is displacement of the average position of the core of the spiral with time due to external symmetry - breaking perturbations , or meandering , which is spontaneous symmetry breaking due to internal instability rather than external forces and which is manifested by complicated movement of the spiral with the average position of the core typically unmoved .",
    "the numerical simulation of drift and meander of spiral waves , particularly when models are complicated and high accuracy is required , can be challenging .",
    "there are some theoretical considerations which suggest some way of dealing with this challenge .",
    "so it has been observed that as far as drift is concerned , spiral waves behave like particle - like objects , which results from effective localization of the critical eigenfunctions of the adjoint linearized operator  @xcite , so it should be sufficient to do the computations only around the core of the spiral to predict its drift . on the other hand , in the absence of external symmetry breaking perturbations , meandering of spirals can be understood by explicitly referring to the euclidean symmetry of the unperturbed problem  @xcite .",
    "specifically , an idea of dynamics in the space of symmetry group orbits  @xcite , when applied to a reaction - diffusion system of equations and the euclidean symmetry group , leads to a description which is formally equivalent to considering the solution in a moving frame of reference ( for ) such that the spiral wave maintains a certain position and orientation in this frame  @xcite .",
    "we shall call it comoving for for short .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present a computational approach based on these considerations .",
    "we calculate the dynamics of the spiral wave in a comoving for ; as a result , the core of the spiral never approaches the boundaries of the computation box , which allows computations of drift and meandering of large spatial extent using small numerical grids .",
    "a simple software implementation of this approach , which is based on the popular spiral wave simulator ` ez - spiral '  @xcite , and which we called ezride , is provided on the authors website  @xcite .",
    "our approach can be compared to the approach proposed by beyn and thummler  @xcite and further developed by hermann and gottwald  @xcite .",
    "their approach also exploits symmetry group orbits , but is different in some essential details .",
    "we shall discuss the similarities and differences when we will have introduced our method .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : maths ] we lay out mathematical basics of the approach  and briefly compare it with @xcite . in section  [ sec : numerics ] we describe the numerical method itself . in section  [ sec : examples ] we illustrate the work of the method by simple and quick examples .",
    "the potential for numerical accuracy is demonstrated in section  [ sec : convergence ] .",
    "the subsequent three section are dedicated to examples of applications of the methods to problems where the conventional methods would be struggling : section  [ sec : resonance ] for the degenerate case of meandering which results in `` spontaneous drift '' of spirals ; section  [ sec : largecore ] for the dynamics near to , and beyond , the parametric boundary at which the core radius of the spiral becomes infinite ; and section  [ sec : drift ] for drift caused by a symmetry breaking perturbation .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "[ sec : maths ]    following @xcite , we start from a perturbed reaction - diffusion system of equations in a plane , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a column - vector of reagent concentrations varying in space and time , @xmath2 is a column - vector of reaction rates , @xmath3 is the matrix of diffusion coefficients , @xmath4 represents symmetry - breaking perturbations , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , then equation  ( [ eq : rdeu ] ) is equivariant with respect to euclidean transformations of the spatial coordinates @xmath9 .",
    "the following technical discussion is necessary to place our method in the context of other works in the field .",
    "readers not interested in technical details may skip down to system ( [ eq : ezfnum ] ) .",
    "the idea of the symmetry group reduction is convenient to describe if we view ( [ eq : rdeu ] ) as an ordinary differential equation in a suitably chosen functional space @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the dynamic field @xmath13 , @xmath14 represents the unperturbed right - hand side @xmath15 , and @xmath16 represents the perturbation @xmath17 .    let us suppose that equation ( [ eq : rdeu ] ) at @xmath8 is equivariant with respect to a representation @xmath18 of a lie group @xmath19 in @xmath10 .",
    "this means that for any @xmath20 and any @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 in our case , @xmath23 , the special euclidean transformations of the plane @xmath24 ( including translations and rotations ) , and @xmath18 is its representation in the space of functions @xmath25 defined on this plane , acting as @xmath26    we consider a subset @xmath27 such that @xmath19 acts freely on @xmath28 ,  for a @xmath29 , any nontrivial transformation @xmath20 changes @xmath30 , in other words , @xmath31 . in the terminology of @xcite , @xmath28 is the principal stratum of @xmath10 , corresponding to the trivial isotropy subgroups . in our case",
    ", this means that the graph of the function @xmath32 is devoid of any rotational or translational symmetry , which is of course true for functions describing single - armed spiral waves .",
    "it is straightforward that at @xmath33 , the set @xmath28 is an invariant set of ( [ eq : rdeu ] ) .",
    "moreover , we shall restrict our consideration to such perturbations @xmath34 that resulting solutions @xmath35 remain in @xmath28 for all @xmath36 .",
    "this means , that the perturbations are supposed to be so small they can not impose incidental symmetry on the otherwise unsymmetric spiral wave solutions .",
    "a group orbit of a given @xmath30 is defined as the set @xmath37 .",
    "that is , it is a set of all such functions @xmath25 that can be obtained from one another by applying an appropriate euclidean transformation to @xmath9 .",
    "a group orbit is a manifold in @xmath28 , of a dimensionality equal to @xmath38 less the dimensionality of the isotropy group . in our case ,",
    "@xmath39 , the isotropy group is trivial and the orbits are smooth three - dimensional manifolds .    from the definition of the set @xmath28 it follows that this set is foliated by group orbits .",
    "the principal assumption for the following analysis is that there exists an open subset @xmath40 , also invariant with respect to @xmath19 , in which the foliation has a global transversal section ,  we can select one representative from each orbit in @xmath41 , such that all such representatives form a smooth manifold @xmath42 , which is everywhere transversal to the group orbits .",
    "we call this manifold a _ representative manifold _ ( rm )",
    ". that would mean that any orbit in @xmath41 crosses @xmath43 transversally and exactly once .",
    "hence @xmath44 the rm has co - dimensionality equal to the dimensionality of the group orbits ,  in our case @xmath45 .",
    "it is assumed to be smooth and we expect that it can locally be described by equations @xmath46 , @xmath47 , where functions @xmath48 ,  are functionals when interpreted in terms of the original reaction - diffusion equation ( [ eq : rdeu ] ) .",
    "a convenient pictorial interpretation for our case is in terms of spiral wave solutions and their tips .",
    "suppose the conditions @xmath49 , @xmath50 determine that the tip of the spiral wave is located at the origin , and condition @xmath51 fixes its orientation , so @xmath43 consists of such functions that look like spiral waves @xmath52 which have the tip exactly at the origin and in a standard orientation .",
    "then equation ( [ eq : manifold ] ) states that any spiral wave solution @xmath25 , considered at a fixed moment of time , can be transformed by a euclidean transformation , in a unique way , to a solution @xmath53 which has its tip at the origin and in the standard orientation .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that @xmath53 is the same as @xmath25 only considered in a different system of coordinates , with the origin at the tip of @xmath25 and oriented accordingly to the orientation of that tip .",
    "we shall say this is the system of coordinates _ attached to the tip_. an example of @xmath54 , as used  in @xcite , is    [ eq : mus ] @xmath55=v^{(l_1)}({\\vec{0}})-{u _ * } ,                    { \\label{eq : mu1}}\\\\    \\mu_2[{{\\mathbf{v}}}({{\\vec r}})]=v^{(l_2)}({\\vec{0}})-{v _ * } ,                     { \\label{eq : mu2}}\\\\    \\mu_3[{{\\mathbf{v}}}({{\\vec r}})]=\\partial_xv^{(l_3)}({\\vec{0 } } ) ,                 { \\label{eq : mu3}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 are suitably chosen components , and @xmath57 .",
    "this means that the tip of @xmath25 is defined as the point of intersection of isolines of the components @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the field @xmath13 at appropriately chosen levels @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively , and the orientation of the attached coordinate system is such that gradient of component @xmath62 ( which may or may not coincide with @xmath58 or @xmath59 ) is along the @xmath63-axis in that system .",
    "this choice of @xmath54 is of course not prescriptive , and later in this paper we shall consider some variations .    regardless of the exact definition of the tip ,  choice of functionals @xmath54 , an essential assumption that we have to make",
    "is that our spiral waves have one tip only , otherwise there would be more than one way to transform them to the standard position or to chose the attached system of coordinates .",
    "hence the reason for a further constraint to the subset @xmath40 , which we now can define as consisting of such one - tip spiral wave solutions , or functions that look like it : without such constraint , the whole set @xmath28 includes solutions with no tips or more than one tip , for which the decomposition ( [ eq : manifold ] ) would not hold . as before , we assume that set @xmath41 is invariant with respect to the dynamic equation ( [ eq : rdeu ] ) for not too big @xmath64 , that is , if @xmath65 , then @xmath66 for all @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "a further restriction is on the manifold @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that equations like ( [ eq : mus ] ) may not be sufficient to define the manifold with the required property that any orbit crosses it only once .",
    "for instance , if @xmath53 satisfies ( [ eq : mus ] ) , then @xmath69 also satisfies it , so a rotation by @xmath70 around the origin transfers a point on @xmath41 to another point on @xmath41 .",
    "so to make the representation ( [ eq : manifold ] ) unique , rather than just requiring that the gradient of the @xmath62-component of @xmath53 is along the @xmath63 axis , one would need to specify in which direction it is , say add to the definition of @xmath43 by the equations @xmath71=0 $ ] a further inequality @xmath72>0 ,     \\quad \\textrm{where } \\quad    \\mu_4[{{\\mathbf{v}}}({{\\vec r}})]=\\partial_yv^{(l_3)}.                                                              { \\label{eq : mu4}}\\ ] ]    this comment extends to the variations of ( [ eq : mus ] ) which we consider later .    by performing the decomposition ( [ eq : manifold ] ) for every @xmath73 , we decompose motion in @xmath41 to motion along the rm and motion along group orbits which are transversal to the rm ( see illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory - banach ] ) .    , which has exactly one transversal intersection with evey group orbit @xmath74 within the relevant stratum of the phase space @xmath10 and is diffeomorphic to the orbit manifold .",
    "trajectory @xmath75 of an equivariant flow in @xmath10 is a relative periodic orbit , since it projects onto the trajectory @xmath76 on @xmath43 which is periodic .",
    "the flow on @xmath43 is devoid of symmetry @xmath19 . ]",
    "[ fig : theory - banach ]    so for all @xmath73 , we have @xmath77 substituting ( [ eq : utv ] ) into ( [ eq : rdeu ] ) and applying @xmath78 to both sides , we get @xmath79 where @xmath80 we note that if @xmath33 , the right - hand side of ( [ eq : rdev ] ) is independent of @xmath81 .    by the assumptions made , intersection of the group orbit",
    "@xmath82 with the manifold @xmath43 at the point @xmath52 is transversal .",
    "this means that the vectors @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be uniquely decomposed into the sums of the components along the group and along the manifold ,    @xmath85    [ eq : fhsplit ]    hence equation ( [ eq : rdev ] ) splits into two components , along the rm and along the group orbit ( go ) :    @xmath86    [ eq : decomposed ]    note that equation ( [ eq : mani ] ) is the equation on the infinite - dimensional manifold @xmath43 ,  corresponds to a partial differential equation , whereas the left- and right - hand sides of the equation ( [ eq : group ] ) are in the tangent space to the finite - dimensional group orbits , and the dynamic variable @xmath81 is an element of the finite - dimensional manifold @xmath19 , so ( [ eq : group ] ) is in fact a system of ordinary differential equations of order @xmath38 .    at this point",
    "we comment on what we see as a significant difference between our approach and that proposed by beyn and thummler  @xcite ( bt ) . using our notation , in place of our `` pinning '' conditions @xmath46 , @xmath87",
    ", they defined `` phase conditions '' of the form @xmath88 ( see equation ( 2.22 ) in @xcite ) , subsequently further generalized to @xmath89 ( , equation ( 2.33 ) ) .",
    "this means that their decomposition @xmath90 is not uniquely determined by the current state @xmath30 , but depends on history .",
    "such generalization may have its advantages and , apparently , works well for relative equilibria ,  steadily rotating spirals  @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is different if the solution is a meandering spiral ,  is periodic with period @xmath91 in the orbit space ( as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : theory - banach ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath92 is equivalent to @xmath35 up to some euclidean transformation . in our approach , it is then guaranteed , that @xmath93 , as by ( [ eq : manifold ] ) , @xmath94 has a unique solution for @xmath81 at a given @xmath30 . however , in the bt approach , typically @xmath95 , since @xmath96 does not uniquely define @xmath81 , as @xmath97 is not fixed .",
    "so in our approach , study of meandering spirals reduces to study of periodic solutions for @xmath98 , but it does not do so in the bt approach .",
    "a practical approach to the problem of decomposing the vector fields as in ( [ eq : fhsplit ] ) is as follows .",
    "equations ( [ eq : decomposed ] ) together with the definition of the rm via functionals @xmath54 can be re - written in an equivalent form    [ eq : man ] @xmath99    where @xmath100 is a vector belonging to the three - dimensional tangent space of the group orbit @xmath101 at @xmath52 . in this formulation , at any given moment of time , equations ( [ eq : along - man ] ) and ( [ eq : on - man ] ) together define the evolution of @xmath52 and the current value of the vector @xmath102 , whereas equation ( [ eq : across - man ] ) defines the evolution of @xmath81 .    by definition ,",

    "this is the `` skew - product '' decomposition , the upper part describing the dynamics in the space of group orbits , so called `` quotient system '' , and the lower part the `` symmetry group extension '' ,   dynamics along the group , which depends on but does not affect the quotient dynamic .",
    "the connection between the quotient system and the group extension is via the dynamic variables @xmath127 ; in the following , we refer to these three quantities as `` quotient data '' for brevity .",
    "the skew - product representation has been useful for the analysis of various types of meander of spiral waves @xcite .",
    "note that the approach used in @xcite ( also see references therein ) is based on the assumption that the meandering pattern in question is considered in the vicinity of a bifurcation from the rigidly rotating spiral wave solution , so that the quotient dynamics can be reduced to the centre manifold , hence instead of equations ( [ eq : ezfnum - rda ] ) , ( [ eq : ezfnum - pina ] ) and ( [ eq : ezfnum - pinb ] ) , these studies considered normal forms on the corresponding centre manifolds . however , as noted in @xcite , the centre manfold theorem is not applicable for spiral waves , so this approach seems to be fundamentally flawed .",
    "this technical difficulty of course does not in any way affect the validity of system ( [ eq : ezfnum ] ) , which , as we have just demonstrated , is derived by elementary means without recourse to any bifurcations .    in the rest of the paper , we consider system ( [ eq : ezfnum ] ) as a computational tool , rather than an instrument of theoretical analysis .",
    "the disadvantage of the original system ( [ eq : rdeu ] ) as a computational tool is that it requires a big computational grid to simulate dynamics of a spiral in an infinite medium , particularly when the tip of the spiral performs excursions to large distances .",
    "this is actually not necessary , as the dynamics of the spiral is mostly determined by the events in some finite vicinity of its tip @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ eq : ezfnum ] ) takes advantage of this property so that the pde calculations are done always in some fixed vicinity of the spiral wave , whereas the movement of the tip is described by the ode part .",

    "[ fig : fhndr ] we see that although , as we know from figures  [ fig : clips ] and [ fig : mean ] , the discretization is too crude to give quantitative agreement between laboratory and comoving calculations in detail , the drift velocities obtained in these two ways are very similar .",
    "we illustrate the relative advantages of the two methods of calculation by comparing the computation costs .",
    "the laboratory for simulation , for @xmath218 and @xmath282 $ ] has taken 325  sec ( the spiral has annihilated at the left at @xmath283 ) .",
    "the time taken by the comoving for simulation for the same boxsize @xmath238 and the same @xmath36 interval is 462  sec ,  is naturally somewhat longer due to the extra effort required for the advection term calculations .",
    "however , the comoving for calculation proceeded unabated where the laboratory for calculation failed due to annihilation with the border .",
    "to continue the laboratory for calculation to the same extent we would have to increase the box size @xmath238 with a corresponding increase in computation cost .",
    "moreover , virtually the same result , as far as drift velocity is concerned , can be obtained by comoving for calculation with @xmath208 , and it takes only 202  sec .",
    "of course the drift in the laboratory for with @xmath208 would terminate even earlier .",
    "[ sec : discussion ]    we have described a numerical method of solving a reaction - diffusion system of equations describing a spiral wave , in a frame of reference which is moving with the tip of that wave .    we have shown the method can provide accurate solutions , and that there are applications where the computational cost of our method can be considerably lower than that of the conventional approach , or the conventional approach is just inapplicable .   as always , the computational advantages are particularly essential in case of parametric studies , for which the method is well suited . although the applications were chosen just to provide some meaningful examples of use of the method , the results obtained there can be of scientific value themselves .",
    "so , we have investigated the vicinity of the `` 1:1 resonance '' manifold in the parametric space , which corresponds to spontaneous drift of spirals , and which separates meandering patterns with outward petals and inward petals .",
    "henry  @xcite has proposed a theory which implies that this manifold coincides or is an analytical continuation of the manifold where the filament tension of scroll waves vanishes .",
    "there are reports in literature confirming that change of sign of filament tension is associated with change from outward to inward petals in meandering patterns , but also examples where there are no such correlation ,  @xcite and references therein .",
    "our simulations indicate that as far as orbit manifold dynamics of the spiral is concerned , the 1:1 resonance is not characterized by any special features .",
    "hence any special features of this resonance ought to be due to the euclidean extension of the orbifold dynamics .",
    "since scroll filament tension can also be defined via properties of the spiral wave solutions within the comoving for , any genetic and generic relationship between the two manifolds seems unlikely ( but , of course , can not exclude the possibility of such relationship in some special cases ) .",
    "we have also investigated the vicinity of the `` @xmath253 '' manifold in the parametric space , which has provided a strong evidence towards one of the two theoretical possible asymptotics , namely elkin  @xcite asymptotics as opposed to hakim - karma  @xcite asymptotics .",
    "it should be noted here that while hakim - karma asymptotic theory was based on assumptions which have been well established , the elkin  asymptotic theory was using assumptions , validity of which could not be asserted at that moment .",
    "here we have presented firm evidence that elkin  asymptotis is not a mere theoretical possibility but is indeed observed in reality ( see also  @xcite and a discussion below ) .",
    "a direct confirmation would be via calculation of the `` response functions '' ,  critical eigenfunctions of the adjoint linearized operator of the critical finger solution .",
    "this would require obtaining first a good quality critical finger solution , so the method described here can be a significant step towards this goal , too .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that calculations in the comoving for can be efficiently used to study perturbation - caused drift of spirals , including meandering spirals .",
    "although the asymptotic theory of drift of meandering spirals is yet to be developed ( see , however , a preliminary draft of such theory in  @xcite ) , we can expect , for instance , that scroll waves in the fitzhugh - nagumo model with the parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fhn - movie ] , [ fig : fhndr ] will have `` positive tension '' ,  tend to collapse , rather than develop a scroll wave turbulence .",
    "the advantage of calculating drift in the comoving for , apart from computation cost , is absence of `` pinning '' effects of spatial discretization , both in terms of discrete space steps and discrete spatial directions , on the drift .",
    "our approach can be compared to the approach proposed by beyn and thummler ( bt )  @xcite .",
    "bt use a similar mathematical idea of decomposing the evolution of the nonlinear wave into the motion of the wave and evolution of its shape , which in the functional space appears as decomposition into motion along and across the euclidean symmetry group orbits .",
    "but there are also differences .",
    "there are technical details of implementations which are probably of lesser importance , such as choice of polar vs cartesian grid , central vs upwind discretization of spatial derivatives and explicit vs semi - implicit discretization in time .",
    "more significant differences are in the `` phase conditions '' they use , which play the same role as , but are qualitatively different in nature from , our `` pinning conditions '' .",
    "one aspect is that the phase conditions involve integral functionals .",
    "we show here that this is not necessary , and local conditions like  ( [ eq : musteps ] ) are simpler .",
    "the other aspect is the one we discussed in section  [ sec : maths ] : the bt phase conditions appear to be well suited for calculation of relative equilibria ( rigidly rotating spirals ) but not necessarily for relative periodic solutions ( meandering spirals ) .",
    "further , the phase conditions proposed by bt were not intended for use with symmetry breaking perturbations that produce drift of spirals . and",
    "indeed , bt comment in their paper that `` it seems quite a challenging task to freeze drifting spirals or recognize meandering spirals as periodic orbits . '' as we have demonstrated , our approach works both for meandering spirals and for drifting spirals .    after completing this study",
    "we became aware of a work by hermann and gottwald ( hg ) @xcite who also investigated the large core limit , using a further development of the bt method .",
    "hg have paid a great deal of attention to refining the boundary conditions so as to minimize the effect of boundaries onto the quotient dynamics .",
    "this has allowed them , in particular , to verify the linear scaling law ( [ eq : ebhlaw ] ) for seven decades of variation of @xmath203 , compared to mere one decade as shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : lc - curves ] . notice that as shown in the same figure , our progress towards smaller values of @xmath203 is limited precisely by the influence of boundaries .",
    "hg also have explicitly addressed the issue of the numerical stability of the computations , which we treat in this study purely empirically .",
    "we believe that combining the advantageous features of the approach developed by bt and hg , and the one proposed here , is an interesting topic for future work , which may yield further results about spiral wave dynamics , that are not possible , or very difficult , to obtain by direct numerical simulations .",
    "this study has been supported in part by a ph.d studentship from the university of liverpool and by epsrc grant  ep / d074789/1 .",
    "the preliminary stage for this study was done in collaboration with b.n .",
    "vasiev , who proposed the idea of solving for quotient data simultaneously with the advection substep .",
    "vnb is also grateful to a.m.  pertsov and g.a .",
    "gottwald for inspiring discussions , and to g.a .",
    "gottwald also for informing us about the results of  @xcite prior to publication ."
