    "in the standard model of particle physics , charge - parity - time reversal ( cpt ) symmetry is a fundamental symmetry .",
    "probing its violation is an important way to search for the new physics beyond the standard model . up to now , cpt symmetry has passed a number of high - precision experimental tests and no definite signal of its violation has been observed in the laboratory .",
    "so , the present cpt violating effects , if they exist , should be very small to be amenable to the experimental limits .",
    "however , the cpt symmetry could be dynamically violated in the expanding universe . in the literature @xcite",
    ", the cosmological cpt violation mechanism has an interesting feature , which is that the cpt violating effects at present are too small to be detected by the laboratory experiments , but large enough in the early universe to account for the generation of matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "more importantly , these types of cpt violating effects could be accumulated to be observable in the cosmological experiments @xcite . with the accumulation of high - quality observational data , especially those from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments ,",
    "cosmological observation becomes a powerful way to test the cpt symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we firstly consider the cosmological cpt violation in the photon sector where the electrodynamics is modified by a chern - simons term @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 is an external vector and @xmath10 is the dual of the electromagnetic tensor .",
    "this term violates the lorentz and cpt symmetries if @xmath9 is treated as an external field .",
    "one of the physical consequences of this electromagnetic chern - simons ( ecs ) term is the rotation of the polarization direction of electromagnetic waves propagating over large distances @xcite , which is known as `` cosmological birefringence '' .",
    "this rotation angle @xmath5 can be obtained by observing polarized radiation from distant sources such as radio galaxies , quasars , and cmb . for the standard theory of cmb , the tb and eb cross - correlation power spectra vanish . in the presence of the non - zero rotation angle @xmath5 , one expects to observe non - zero tb and eb power spectra , even if they are zero at the last scattering surface . denoting the rotated quantities with a prime ,",
    "one gets @xcite @xmath11 while the cmb temperature power spectrum remains unchanged .",
    "hence we can use the cmb polarization measurements to test the lorentz and cpt symmetries in this ecs model ( see refs.@xcite , and references within ) . with homogeneous and isotropic rotation angle ,",
    "ref.@xcite used the newly released cmb observations and found that a non - zero rotation angle @xmath12 deg ( @xmath1 ) is favored by the cmb polarization data from the seven - year wmap ( wmap7 ) @xcite , boomerang 2003 ( b03 ) @xcite and bicep @xcite observations .",
    "besides the ecs term , the gravitational chern - simons ( gcs ) term could also generate the non - zero cmb tb and eb cross - correlation power spectra .",
    "following refs.@xcite , here we consider a lorentz and cpt violating term in the gravity sector @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the riemann tensor .",
    "this gcs term does not affect the evolution of background and scalar perturbations .",
    "therefore , the effect of gcs term only appears in the evolution of tensor perturbations , if we neglect the vector perturbations .",
    "as we know , the gravitational wave has two independent polarized components denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we usually use the right- and left - handed circular polarized components : @xmath17 the power spectra for different handedness are defined as : @xmath18 , where superscripts @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for the circular polarized state , @xmath21 . due to the presence of this gcs term ,",
    "the produced power spectra @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not equal . similarly with refs.@xcite",
    ", we use a parameter @xmath4 to characterize this discrepancy : @xmath24 we can see that @xmath25 denote purely right - handed polarized , unpolarized and purely left - handed polarized gravitational wave , respectively . in this paper",
    "we only consider the scale - independent @xmath4 simply .",
    "the cmb power spectra generated by the tensor perturbations are given by : @xmath26\\delta^{\\rm x}_\\ell(k)\\delta^{\\rm x'}_\\ell(k)=(4\\pi)^2\\int k^2dkp_h(k)\\delta^{\\rm x}_\\ell(k)\\delta^{\\rm x'}_\\ell(k)~,\\nonumber\\\\ c_\\ell^{\\rm yy'}&=&(4\\pi)^2\\int k^2dk[p^{\\rm r}_h(k)-p^{\\rm l}_h(k)]\\delta^{\\rm y}_\\ell(k)\\delta^{\\rm y'}_\\ell(k)=-(4\\pi)^2\\epsilon\\int k^2dkp_h(k)\\delta^{\\rm y}_\\ell(k)\\delta^{\\rm y'}_\\ell(k)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote tt , te , ee , bb and tb , eb , respectively , and @xmath29 are the transfer functions .",
    "these equations show that the tt , te , ee and bb power spectra only depend on the sum of the primordial power spectra of gravitational waves , while the tb and eb power spectra rely on the difference between the power spectra of right- and left - handed polarized components @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , in the presence of the gcs term , the non - zero tb and eb correlations will be generated and other four power spectra are unchanged .    in this paper we will study the effects of ecs and gcs terms on the cmb power spectra in detail and perform a global analysis on them by using the latest cmb polarization measurements , as well as the future simulated cmb data .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ data ] we describe the current and future simulated datasets we use .",
    "section [ result ] contains our main results from the current observations and future measurements , while section [ summary ] is dedicated to the conclusions and discussion .",
    "in our calculations we mainly use the full data of wmap7 temperature and polarization power spectra @xcite .",
    "the wmap7 polarization data are composed of te / tb / ee / bb / eb power spectra on large scales ( @xmath31 ) and te / tb power spectra on small scales ( @xmath32 ) , while the wmap7 temperature data are only used to set the underlying cosmology . for the systematic error",
    ", the wmap instrument can measure the polarization angle to within @xmath33 deg of the design orientation @xcite . in the computation we use the routines for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team .",
    "besides the wmap7 information , we also use some small - scale cmb observations .",
    "the _ boomerang dated january 2003 antarctic flight _ @xcite measures the small - scale cmb polarization power spectra in the range of @xmath34 .",
    "recently , the boomerang collaboration re - analyzed the cmb power spectra and took into account the effect of systematic errors rotating the polarization angle by @xmath35 deg @xcite .",
    "recently , the _ background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization _ ( bicep ) @xcite and _ qu extragalactic survey telescope at dasi _ ( quad ) @xcite collaborations released their high precision data of the cmb temperature and polarization including the tb and eb power spectra .",
    "these two experiments , locating at the south pole , are the bolometric polarimeters designed to capture the cmb information at two different frequency bands of @xmath36ghz and @xmath37ghz , and on small scales  the released first two - year bicep data are in the range of @xmath38 @xcite ; whereas the quad team measures the polarization spectra at @xmath39 , based on an analysis of the observation in the second and third season @xcite .",
    "they also provide the systematic errors of measuring the polarization angle , @xmath40 deg and @xmath41 deg , for bicep and quad observations , respectively .",
    ".assumed experimental specifications .",
    "we use the cmb power spectra only at @xmath42 .",
    "the noise parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given in units of @xmath45k - arcmin . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "probing the violation of fundamental symmetries is an important way to search for the new physics beyond the standard model . in this paper we present constraints on the ecs and gcs models using the latest cmb polarization data , as well as the future simulated mock data .    in the constraints of rotation angle , induced by the ecs model , we extend our previous works by including the systematic errors of cmb polarization measurements .",
    "we consider two rotation angles , @xmath5 and @xmath46 , in order to take into account the real rotation signal and a systematic error for each cmb polarization measurement , and impose priors on the systematic errors . adding the systematic effects of cmb polarization data",
    ", we do not find significant change on the constraints of @xmath5 , except the error bars become slightly larger .",
    "wmap7+b03+bicep data combination still favors a non - zero rotation angle about @xmath2 confidence level , namely @xmath47 , no matter whether the systematic effects are included .",
    "we still find a @xmath48 tension between quad and wmap7+b03+bicep observations .",
    "when combining all cmb polarization data together , we obtain the tight constraint on the rotation angle at 95% confidence level : @xmath3 ( deg ) , which is consistent with a cpt - conserving universe .",
    "since the current constraints on the rotation angle are not conclusive , we simulate the future planck polarization data .",
    "we find that the future cmb data could significantly improve the constraint of @xmath5 by a factor of @xmath6 ( @xmath49 deg ) . because a non - zero rotation angle will generate the bb power spectrum , we need to take this effect into account properly in the future data analysis .",
    "otherwise the constraints of cosmological parameters will be apparently biased .",
    "we also give the constraint on the parameter @xmath4 , which is induced by the gcs term and denotes the difference between the right- and left - handed polarized components .",
    "since the effects of non - zero @xmath4 on the tb and eb power spectra are very small , the parameter @xmath4 is almost unconstrained from the current polarization data .",
    "therefore , we simulate the future planck and cmbpol data to constrain @xmath4 further .",
    "we find that the future planck data is very difficult to constrain @xmath4 , if the primordial tensor perturbations are small , @xmath50 .",
    "using the future cmbpol data , the constraint of @xmath4 can be improved to @xmath51 , if the fiducial value @xmath52 .",
    "we could use the future cmbpol data to verify the gcs model .",
    "we acknowledge the use of the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) . support for lambda is provided by the nasa office of space science .                                        c.  q.  geng , s.  h.  ho , j.  n.  ng , jcap * 0709 * , 010 ( 2007 ) ;",
