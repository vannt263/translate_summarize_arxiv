    "power - law distributions have been observed in all domains of the natural sciences as well as in economics , linguistics and many other fields .",
    "widely studied examples of power law distributions include the energy distribution between scales in turbulence @xcite , distribution of earthquake magnitudes @xcite , diameter distribution of craters and asteroids @xcite , the distribution of city populations @xcite , the distributions of income and of wealth @xcite , the size - distribution of business firms @xcite and the distribution of the frequency of appearance of words in texts @xcite . a related phenomenon is the fact that in a variety of systems the temporal fluctuations exhibit a scale invariant behavior in the form of ( truncated ) lvy - stable distributions .",
    "well known examples are the fluctuations in stock markets @xcite .",
    "although systems which exhibit power - law distributions have been studied extensively in recent years there is no universally accepted framework which can explain the origin of the abundance and diversity of power - law distributions .",
    "one context in which the emergence of scaling laws and long range correlations in space and time is well understood is equilibrium statistical physics at the critical point @xcite . by contrast , scaling behavior , power law distributions as well as spatial and temporal power law correlations in * generic * natural systems is still the subject of intense study @xcite .",
    "an approach that proved to be useful in the study of complex systems is to identify for each system the relevant elementary degrees of freedom and their interactions and to follow - up ( by monitoring their computer simulation ) the emergence in the system of the macroscopic collective phenomena @xcite .",
    "this approach was applied to the study of multiscale dynamics in spin glasses @xcite and stock market dynamics @xcite . using a generic class of models with a large number of interacting degrees of freedom",
    ", it was shown that macroscopic dynamics emerges under rather general conditions .",
    "this dynamics exhibits power law scaling as well as intermittency @xcite .",
    "these models turn out to be particularly suitable to describe systems such as stock market dynamics with many individual investors @xcite where each system component describes a single investor ( or stock @xcite ) .",
    "such systems involve complex temporal dynamics of many degrees of freedom but no spatial structure .",
    "the models introduced in @xcite can also describe systems such as population dynamics @xcite , spatial domains in magnetic @xcite or turbulence models @xcite or regions in generic phase spaces @xcite , which have spatial dependence .    in this paper we present numerical studies of generic stochastic lotka - volterra systems .",
    "these systems @xcite basically consist of coupled dynamic equations which describe the discrete time evolution of the basic system components @xmath1 , @xmath11 .",
    "the structure of these equations resembles the logistic map and they are coupled through the average value @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamics includes autocatalysis both at the individual level and at the community level as well as a saturation term .",
    "we find that under very general conditions , the system components spontaneously evolve into a power - law distribution @xmath8 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath9 presents intermittent fluctuations parametrized by a ( truncated ) lvy - stable distribution with the same index @xmath10 , showing an intricate relation between the instantaneous distribution of the system components and the temporal fluctuations of their average .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the generalized logistic model introduced in @xcite .",
    "simulations and results are reported in sec .",
    "iii . discussion of previous results as well as of our findings is given in sec .",
    "iv , and a summary in sec . v.",
    "the generalized logistic system @xcite describes the evolution in discrete time of @xmath12 dynamic variables @xmath1 , @xmath11 . at each time step @xmath13 , an integer @xmath14",
    "is chosen randomly in the range @xmath15 , which is the index of the dynamic variable @xmath1 to be updated at that time step . a random multiplicative factor @xmath6 is then drawn from a given distribution @xmath16 , which is independent of @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "this can be , for example , a uniform distribution in the range @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are predefined limits .",
    "the system is then updated according to    @xmath20    this is an asynchronous update mechanism .",
    "the average value of the system components at time t , is given by    @xmath21    in general , using instead of the average , a weighted average of the @xmath1 s would lead to similar results . the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 may , in general , be slowly varying functions of time , however we will now consider them as constants .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gedilo ] ) , describes the effect of auto - catalysis at the individual level .",
    "for instance , in a stock - market system it represents the increase ( or decrease ) by a random factor @xmath6 of the capital of the investor @xmath14 between time @xmath13 and @xmath22 .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ gedilo ] ) , describes the effect of auto - catalysis at the community level . in an economic model , this term",
    "can be related to the social security policy or to general publicly funded services which every individual receives . in molecular or magnetic systems",
    ", this term may represent the mean - field approximation to the effect of diffusion or convection @xcite . the third term in eq .",
    "( [ gedilo ] ) , describes saturation or the competition for limited resources . in an ecological model",
    ", this term implies that for large enough densities , the population starts to exhaust the available resources and each sub - population loses from the competition over resources a term proportional to the product between the average density population and its own size .",
    "we refer to eq .",
    "( [ gedilo ] ) as the generalized discrete logistic ( gl ) system because when averaged over @xmath14 , this system gives the well known discrete logistic ( lotka - volterra ) equation @xcite    @xmath23    in the general case , the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the distribution @xmath24 may depend on time .",
    "consequently , even the solution of the asymptotic stationarity condition @xmath25 may depend on time according to @xmath26 in fact , the typical dynamics of microscopic market models @xcite is generically _ not _ in a steady state . as will be shown below , systems which exhibit an effective gl dynamics [ eq . ( 1 ) ]",
    "lead @xcite , under very general conditions , to a power law distribution of the values @xmath1 :    @xmath27    moreover , the time evolution of @xmath9 presents intermittent fluctuations following a ( truncated ) lvy - stable distribution with the same index @xmath10 ,",
    "to examine the behavior of the gl model introduced in @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ gedilo ] ) we performed extensive computer simulations .",
    "most simulations were done with @xmath28 system components , using various values of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 and different distributions @xmath16 of the multiplicative factor @xmath29 .",
    "we focused on the power law distribution of the system components @xmath1 as well as on the fluctuations of @xmath30 .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] shows the distribution of @xmath1 , @xmath11 , obtained for @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath29 uniformly distributed in the range @xmath33 .",
    "a power law distribution is found within the range    @xmath34    which is bounded from below by the average wealth and from above by the total wealth , and spans nearly three decades .",
    "the robust nature of the power - law distribution is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bzero ] for @xmath35 . in this case",
    "@xmath36 does not reach a steady state and keeps increasing ( or decreasing ) indefinitely .",
    "however , the power - law behavior is maintained .",
    "moreover we find that the the exponent @xmath10 is insensitive to variations in @xmath5 : even for values of @xmath5 differing by an order of magnitude ( corresponding to @xmath30 varying by an order of magnitude ) , the power law exponent @xmath10 is virtually unchanged .    at each time",
    "step the system component to be updated is chosen randomly . since the system components @xmath1",
    "exhibit a power - law distribution , given by eq .",
    "( [ pareto ] ) , the impact of the update move on @xmath36 exhibits a broad distribution .",
    "the dynamics involves , according eq .",
    "( [ gedilo ] ) , a generalized random walk with steps sizes distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ pareto ] ) .",
    "therefore , the stochastic fluctuations    @xmath37    of @xmath38 after @xmath39 time steps , are governed by a truncated lvy stable distribution @xmath40 .",
    "this means that rather than shrinking like @xmath41 the fluctuations of @xmath42 have infinite variance in the thermodynamic limit ( modulo the truncation ) .",
    "the truncation in the lvy - stable distribution corresponds to the cutoffs in the power - law distribution , given in eq .",
    "( [ trunk ] ) .",
    "typically , the truncation in @xmath43 is bounded by the relative width of @xmath29 times the largest @xmath44 value .",
    "[ fig : levy ] shows the distribution p@xmath45 of the stochastic fluctuations @xmath46 , for @xmath47 , which is given by a lvy - stable distribution @xmath48 .",
    "we find indeed that all the values of @xmath43 are smaller than the relative width of @xmath29 ( 0.1 ) times the maximal value of @xmath44 from fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] .",
    "the cut - off in the distribution of the temporal fluctuations originates therefore in the cut - off in the pareto power law in fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] . in the absence of this cut - off",
    "the variance of the distribution of fluctuations would be infinite .",
    "the divergence of the variance modulo finite size effects is analogous to the divergence of the susceptibility in ordinary statistical mechanics systems at criticality .",
    "the peak of the ( truncated ) lvy - stable distribution scales with @xmath39 according to    @xmath49    where @xmath10 is the index of the distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : levyzero ] we show the height of the peak p@xmath50 of the distribution of fluctuations in @xmath30 as a function of @xmath39 for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] , which give rise to a power - law distribution of the @xmath1 s with @xmath51 .",
    "it is found that the slope of the fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : levyzero ] is @xmath52 which is equal to @xmath53 , following the scaling relation of eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) .",
    "this is a further indication that the fluctuations of @xmath30 follow a lvy - stable distribution with the index @xmath10 which equals the exponent of the pareto power law in fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] .",
    "it is gratifying that an explanation of the 100 years old pareto power law in these non - equilibrium systems which we have studied is provided by a straightforward explicitation of the almost as old lotka - volterra equation @xcite .    to provide more intuition about the dynamics leading to the power law distribution of @xmath1",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "( [ fig : timeevolution ] ) the time evolution of a gl system starting from a uniform distribution of @xmath1 , @xmath54 .",
    "we observe that the distribution gradually broadens .",
    "in the first stages it becomes of log - normal form and then it evolves into a power - law as the non - multiplicative effects in the vicinity of the lower bound become significant .",
    "the numerical results of the previous section show convincingly that generic ( even non - stationary ) systems with effective dynamics governed by the gl system of eq.([gedilo ] ) , lead to ( truncated ) pareto distributions of the system components .",
    "they also lead to ( truncated ) lvy - stable laws of the fluctuations of the average .",
    "let us now explain intuitively why this is the case .",
    "consider first the kesten system which is well known to present power laws @xcite    @xmath55    where the random numbers @xmath29 and @xmath56 are extracted from two positive distributions independent of @xmath13 .",
    "the kesten system has a number of shortcomings which makes it unfit for most practical applications in natural systems :    * in eq .",
    "( [ kesten ] ) , there is only one variable , ( no index @xmath14 ) .",
    "it describes a non - interacting investor ( animal , city ) in a market ( ecology , country ) which induces effectively to him the return ( growth ) @xmath57 after each trade ( reproduction / replication / multiplication ) period @xmath13 . * in order for this system to exhibit a power law distribution , @xmath29 has to be predominantly less than 1 such that it causes @xmath58 to be on average smaller than @xmath59 .",
    "otherwise , the resulting @xmath59 distribution is a log - normal with width expanding in time .",
    "this would correspond in the infinite time limit to a power law of the form @xmath60 .",
    "the dependence of the kesten model on a * shrinking * dynamics is incompatible with most of the natural systems in which the growth is positive .",
    "for instance , the shrinking multiplicative dynamics is certainly not a good model for a stock market where the investors @xmath14 expect their wealth to increase on average ( otherwise they just stay out of the market ) . * in realistic markets ( ecologies , societies ) , the average wealth ( population )",
    "@xmath30 varies significantly in time . in the kesten model",
    "this can be realized only by varying the distributions of @xmath29 and @xmath56 which in turn would significantly affect the exponent @xmath10 of the power law [ eq . ( [ pareto ] ) ] . in the gl system , on the other hand ,",
    "changes in the environment are represented by changes in the coefficient @xmath5 of the resources limitation / competition term .",
    "this can lead to changes by orders of magnitude in the total wealth / population @xmath61 without affecting the exponent @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the exponent @xmath10 , in the distribution of wealth , has been stable for the last one hundred years and across most western ( capitalist ) countries .",
    "we will see later how the gl system solves the shortcomings of the kesten model .",
    "meantime let us give an intuitive explanation of why the kesten system leads to a power law given by eq .",
    "( [ pareto ] ) .",
    "first one should realize that due to the @xmath62 term in eq .",
    "( [ kesten ] ) , the values of @xmath63 are typically kept above a certain minimal value of order @xmath64 .",
    "let us therefore effectively substitute the @xmath56 term in the kesten equation [ eq.([kesten ] ) ] with the condition that @xmath65 .",
    "more precisely , each time @xmath66 becomes smaller than @xmath64 , it is reposed `` by hand '' to the value @xmath64 .    in the resulting system : @xmath67 , with @xmath68 one can take the logarithm : @xmath69 .",
    "the lower bound condition becomes then @xmath70 .",
    "this represents a system in which @xmath71 undergoes a random walk with a drift towards smaller values and with a reflecting barrier at @xmath72 .",
    "one can compare this with a molecule in gravitational field submitted to the collisions with the rest of the gas ( resulting in friction and brownian motion ) and bounded from below by the ground level .",
    "it is not surprising therefore that ( by analogy to the barometric equation ) the resulting probability distribution for @xmath71 is an exponential :    @xmath73    which written in terms of @xmath59 itself gives :    @xmath74    the particular value of @xmath75 depends in the kesten system on the details of the distribution @xmath24 and is such that the drift towards lower values induced by @xmath29 is balanced by the drift to larger values induced by @xmath56 . as a consequence , this model , if ( mistakenly ) applied to the stock market ( ecology , society etc . ) , would predict not only * negative * average returns ( growth ) but also an exponent @xmath10 in the power law that is highly sensitive to the parameters @xcite . on top of all these shortcomings ,",
    "the kesten system does not predict a ( truncated ) lvy - stable distribution of the @xmath30 fluctuations ( as repeatedly measured in nature @xcite ) . to get the ( truncated ) lvy - stable distribution",
    "the following conditions should be satisfied : the index @xmath14 , of the component @xmath1 to be updated at time @xmath13 , is chosen randomly , the @xmath1 s satisfy a power - law distribution and the update step is multiplicative , namely , the change in @xmath1 is proportional to its current value .",
    "for example , even if the dynamics leads to a power - law distribution of @xmath1 , the fluctuation may not be described by lvy - stable distribution if the magnitude of the update of @xmath1 is not proportional to @xmath1 itself .",
    "let us now see how the gl model @xcite solves the problems with the kesten system .",
    "the main new ingredients in the gl model are the appearance of @xmath30 and the appearance of an index @xmath14 in @xmath1 .",
    "these two objects allow the introduction of a crucial ingredient which was absent in the kesten system : the interaction between the investors ( sub - ecologies , sub - systems ) . while the interaction in the stock market ( ecology , society )",
    "is represented in the kesten system only implicitly by the stock returns ( growth ) @xmath76 we introduce now additional interactions between the investors ( individuals , families ) @xmath14 which are mediated by the average @xmath38 and are crucial for the dynamics of the system .",
    "obviously , such terms , containing @xmath38 could not appear in an equation like kesten which considers only the dynamics of one variable at a time . in order to introduce the crucial terms including @xmath30 one has to give up the picture of a single random investor and to embrace the picture of a macroscopic set of microscopic investors , interacting among themselves through the market mechanisms .",
    "the result is the system of nonlinear gl equations which are coupled through @xmath36 [ eq .",
    "( [ gedilo ] ) ] . in order to gain insight into the emergence of the power law and lvy - stable intermittency in the gl system ,",
    "one can express it formally as : @xmath77 w_i ( t ) + a(t)\\bar w(t ) \\label{tuning}\\ ] ] if one ignores for the moment the effect of the changes of @xmath1 s on the value of @xmath30 , the system [ eq . ( [ tuning ] ) ] is of the kesten type [ eq .",
    "( [ kesten ] ) ] and we expect therefore the emergence of a scaling law , given by eq .",
    "( [ pareto ] ) .",
    "if the effect of the changes in @xmath1 on @xmath30 is considered , then one sees that ( for non - vanishing @xmath5 ) the system is self - tuning towards the value of @xmath30 given by eq .",
    "( [ equil ] ) .",
    "this self - tuning is realized by the dynamics of the average in eq .",
    "( [ tuning ] ) . if @xmath38 is small , then according the first term in eq .",
    "( [ tuning ] ) , @xmath1 will typically increase and will make @xmath38 increase too . if @xmath38 is large , then according the first term in eq .",
    "( [ tuning ] ) , @xmath1 will typically decrease and will make @xmath38 decrease . while in the synchronous lotka - volterra [ with a global time step updating based on eq .",
    "( 3 ) ] the system may have large steps and get into behavior alternating chaotically between large and small @xmath63 values , in the case of the sequential updating [ eq . ( 1 ) ] of the @xmath1 s , the average will eventually self tune to a value of @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ equil ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations around this value will be dominated by the first term in eq.([tuning ] ) and will consist of a random walk with steps proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath1 are distributed by a power law , the fluctuations will be distributed by a lvy - stable distribution of corresponding index @xcite . in order to understand why the @xmath1 distribution is only weakly dependent on @xmath78",
    ", one can substitute eq .",
    "( [ equil ] ) in to eq .",
    "( [ tuning ] ) and use the normalized variables @xmath79 .",
    "one then obtains an equation of the kesten form : @xmath80 v_i ( t ) + a(t ) \\label{tun}\\ ] ] note that we used here the approximation that the dynamics of @xmath30 is much slower than the dynamics of @xmath1 .",
    "one observes that both @xmath78 and @xmath38 are absent from eq .",
    "( [ tun ] ) : their respective effects cancel .",
    "in fact , one finds in simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bzero ] ) that the distribution of @xmath81 ( and therefore of @xmath82 ) fulfills a power law of eq .",
    "( [ pareto ] ) with exponent @xmath10 independent on the variations of @xmath36 .",
    "one also sees from eq .",
    "( [ tun ] ) that the dynamics is invariant to an overall shift in the distribution @xmath24 .",
    "this means that in particular the gl multiplicative factors @xmath29 can be significantly ( and generically ) larger than unity allowing ( in contrast to the kesten system ) for expanding ( growing ) dynamics . eq .",
    "( [ tuning ] ) implies time correlations in the _ amplitude _ of the fluctuations of @xmath30 .",
    "it was brought to our attention by d. sornette that our data seem consistent with the log - periodic corrections due to complex exponents discussed in @xcite as well as other the other data collected in the stock market @xcite .",
    "our mechanism relates the emergence of power - laws and macroscopic fluctuations to the existence of auto - catalyzing sub - sets in systems composed of many microscopic entities .",
    "in particular , the use of the @xmath30 is not mandatory : generic systems of the type @xmath83 may also present similar properties . at a more conceptual level , the challenge is to identify , in an as wide as possible range of natural systems , the elementary objects @xmath14 , the degrees of freedom @xmath1 associated with them and the gl interactions explaining in each case the emergence of scaling and intermittency .",
    "in summary , we have studied the dynamics of a generic class of stochastic lotka - volterra ( discrete logistic ) systems introduced in @xcite using computer simulations .",
    "these systems consist of a large number of interacting degrees of freedom @xmath82 , @xmath2 , which are updated asynchronously .",
    "the time evolution of each system component is dominated by a stochastic individual autocatalytic dynamics , in addition to a global autocatalytic interaction mediated by the average @xmath36 , and a saturation term .",
    "these models describe a large variety of systems such as stock markets and city populations .",
    "we find that the distribution @xmath7 of the system components @xmath1 , fulfills a pareto power - law @xmath84 .",
    "the average @xmath9 exhibits intermittent fluctuations following a ( truncated ) lvy - stable distribution with the same index @xmath10 .",
    "this intricate relation between the distribution of system components and the temporal fluctuations resembles the behavior of a variety of empirical systems .",
    "for example , it provides a connection between the power - law distribution of wealth in society and the fluctuations in the stock market which follow a ( truncated ) lvy - stable distribution ."
