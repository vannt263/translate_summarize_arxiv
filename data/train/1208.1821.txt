    "the inner parts of barred galaxies contain interesting gaseous substructures that include dust lanes , nuclear rings , and nuclear spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these substructures are thought to form as a result of gas redistribution in galaxies initiated by non - axisymmetric bar torque ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "understanding their formation and evolution is therefore of crucial importance to understand how the interstellar gas in barred galaxies is driven inward to affect star formation activities in the nuclear regions and potentially fueling of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "since their spatial locations and shapes are likely to be determined by the bar strength as well as the underlying rotation curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they may also be used to probe the mass distributions in barred galaxies that are not directly observable .    while the bar substructures have been observed for a long time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is during recent years that high - quality data on their physical properties have been compiled and compared with bar characteristics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is increasing observational evidence that the shape and size of the bar substructures are determined primarily by the bar strength @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , @xcite measured the curvature angles @xmath14 of dust lanes for a sample of 9 barred - spiral galaxies , and found that stronger bars favor more straight dust lanes , confirming a theoretical prediction of @xcite .",
    "by extending the sample size to 55 galaxies , @xcite confirmed the results of @xcite , although they also found that a large scatter in the fit of the @xmath14@xmath3 relationship can be reduced if the bar ellipticity is also considered in the fit .",
    "more recently , @xcite measured the sizes and shapes of nuclear rings in a sample of 107 galaxies , finding that ` stronger bars host smaller rings ' and that the ring ellipticity is in the range of 00.4 .",
    "@xcite reported from the analysis of 13 nuclear rings that the ring size is well correlated with the compactness of the galaxy mass distribution such that higher mass concentration implies a smaller ring . on the other hand , by analyzing dust morphology in the nuclear regions of 75 galaxies , @xcite found that tightly - would nuclear spirals are preferentially found in galaxies with a weak bar .    on the theoretical side",
    ", the formation and evolution of bar substructure has been extensively studied using numerical simulations on hydrodynamical models ( e.g. @xcite ) and magnetized models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", @xcite confirmed the early notion of @xcite that dust lanes are shocks in the gas flows .",
    "she also showed that dust lanes are more straight when the bar potential is stronger . due to lack of numerical resolution and/or large numerical viscosity , however , early numerical works published before the middle of 1990s were unable to capture the formation of nuclear rings and spirals accurately .",
    "@xcite was the first who focused on the ring formation using a grid - based code with negligible numerical viscosity .",
    "unfortunately , however , their numerical results were , at least quantitatively , contaminated by a trivial sign error in the evaluation of the bar forces , as identified by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite used sph simulations to study gas dynamics in the central regions of barred galaxies , but they were unable to resolve nuclear spirals because most particles in their simulations are captured into a ring , leaving only a small number of particles inside the ring .    very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) corrected the error in @xcite and revisited the issue of the bar - substructure formation using high - resolution simulations by varying the gas sound speed @xmath15 and the mass of a central black hole ( bh ) .",
    "paper i found that the corrected bar force naturally allows the development of nuclear spirals inside a ring , which was unseen in @xcite .",
    "in addition , paper i showed that the ring size and the mass inflow rate @xmath16 toward the galaxy center depend rather sensitively on @xmath15 . in models with small @xmath15 , the rings are narrow and located away from the center .",
    "this prevents further inflows of the gas to the central regions , making @xmath16 smaller than @xmath17 .",
    "on the the other hand , models with large @xmath15 have a small and broad ring , resulting in @xmath18 .",
    "paper i further confirmed that the prediction of @xcite that the shape of nuclear spirals depend on the sign of the @xmath19 curve such that they are trailing ( leading ) where @xmath19 is negative ( positive ) .",
    "this suggests that nuclear spirals , if exist , are likely to be trailing in galaxies with supermassive bhs .    since the models studied in paper i were restricted to a particular set of the bar parameters , namely , with the bar mass @xmath20 of the spheroidal component ( i.e. , bulge plus bar ) and the aspect ratio @xmath21 , they were unable to study the variations in the size and shape of bar substructures with differing bar strength .",
    "in addition , the models in paper i are all non - self - gravitating , so that the effects of self - gravity on bar substructures have yet to be explored . although @xcite considered diverse bar models with different aspect ratio and bar quadrupole moment @xmath22 , her models were unable to resolve nuclear rings and spirals due to insufficient resolution .",
    "while @xcite also ran a large number of numerical simulations with varying @xmath22 and @xmath2 , their numerical results were compromised by the incorrect bar forces of @xcite , as mentioned above .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a series of hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the properties of bar substructures that form .",
    "this work extends paper i in two ways : ( 1 ) by considering various bar models with differing mass and aspect ratio and ( 2 ) by including gaseous self - gravity , while fixing the sound speed and the bh mass .",
    "we measure the curvatures of dust lanes , sizes of nuclear ring , shapes of nuclear spirals , and mass inflow rates in simulations , and study their relationships with the bar parameters .",
    "our main objective is to explore the parametric dependence of the properties of bar substructures on the bar strength and self - gravity .",
    "this will allow us to provide physical explanations for the formation of bar substructures especially for nuclear rings and spirals , which was previously uncertain .",
    "we also compare our numerical results with observations of barred - spiral galaxies that are currently available .",
    "our models with varying bar strength are useful to address an important question as to what determines the position of nuclear rings .",
    "observations indicates that nuclear rings are typically located near the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) when there is a single ilr , or between the ilrs when there are two ilrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this has often been interpreted as an indication that nuclear rings form as a consequence of the resonant interactions of the gas with the ilrs ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this idea was motivated by the notion that the bar torque changes its sign whenever crossing each ilr such that in the case of a single ilr , for example , the gas inside ( outside ) the ilr receives a positive ( negative ) torque and thus moves outward ( inward ) .",
    "this idea of the resonance - driven ring formation requires that the bar torque dominates thermal and ram pressures of the gas in governing the gas motions both inside and outside the ilr .",
    "it is clear that the bar torque dominates outside the ilr , inducing dust - lane shocks and initiating radial gas inflows .",
    "however , it is uncertain if that is also the case inside the ilr .",
    "the bar potential becomes increasingly axisymmetric toward the galaxy center , while the inflowing gas usually has large momentum and is thus unlikely to stall at the ilr . by measuring the ring positions and comparing them with the ilr radii in our models",
    ", we directly test whether the ilr is really responsible for the formation of nuclear rings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe our model parameters and numerical methods . in section 3 ,",
    "we define and evaluate the bar strength @xmath3 of our galaxy models as well as the radius @xmath4 where the maximum bar torque occurs .",
    "we provide algebraic expressions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 for various bar models . in section 4",
    ", we quantify the properties of bar substructures and explore their correlations with the bar strength .",
    "we also measure the mass inflows rates . finally , in section 5 , we summarize our results and discuss them in comparison with observations .",
    "we study gas responses to an imposed non - axisymmetric bar potential using hydrodynamic simulations with and without self - gravity , focusing on the effects of the bar strength on gaseous structures that form .",
    "we consider an initially - uniform , rotating gaseous disk with surface density @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that the disk is infinitesimally thin , isothermal , and unmagnetized .",
    "the simulations setups and numerical methods are identical to those in paper i , except that some models in the present work include self - gravitational potential of the gas . here",
    "we briefly summarize our numerical models and highlight the differences between the current models and those studied in paper i.    lcccccccc m08r15n & 0.08 & 1.5 & 2.2 & 0.02 & 3.60 & 70.5 @xmath24 0.5 & 35.8 @xmath24 0.9 & 64.2 @xmath24 2.5 + m08r20n & 0.08 & 2.0 & 2.2 & 0.05 & 3.30 & 74.4 @xmath24 5.8 & 35.8 @xmath24 2.9 & 63.4 @xmath24 12.6 + m08r25n & 0.08 & 2.5 & 2.2 & 0.07 & 3.12 & 74.1 @xmath24 2.6 & 44.2 @xmath24 2.3 & 46.3 @xmath24 3.4 + m08r30n & 0.08 & 3.0 & 2.2 & 0.09 & 3.04 & 72.8 @xmath24 3.0 & 53.3 @xmath24 4.0 & 30.1 @xmath24 6.6 + m08r35n & 0.08 & 3.5 & 2.2 & 0.12 & 2.98 & 74.3 @xmath24 1.7 & 59.6 @xmath24 5.2 & 22.2 @xmath24 6.7 + m15r15n & 0.15 & 1.5 & 2.1 & 0.04 & 3.58 & 75.1 @xmath24 1.4 & 34.5 @xmath24 1.6 & 81.6 @xmath24 2.9 + m15r20n & 0.15 & 2.0 & 2.1 & 0.08 & 3.28 & 71.7 @xmath24 3.2 & 49.6 @xmath24 4.3 & 36.3 @xmath24 9.0 + m15r25n & 0.15 & 2.5 & 2.2 & 0.13 & 3.12 & 75.3 @xmath24 2.5 & 63.4 @xmath24 2.3 & 19.6 @xmath24 4.2 + m15r30n & 0.15 & 3.0 & 2.2 & 0.17 & 3.04 & 73.4 @xmath24 2.5 & 68.3 @xmath24 2.4 & 8.2 @xmath24 4.4 + m15r35n & 0.15 & 3.5 & 2.2 & 0.21 & 2.98 & 74.3 @xmath24 5.1 & 71.1 @xmath24 5.4 & 5.0 @xmath24 3.6 + m30r15n & 0.30 & 1.5 & 1.8 & 0.08 & 3.56 & 70.7 @xmath24 3.4 & 38.9 @xmath24 3.9 & 63.4 @xmath24 10.0 + m30r20n & 0.30 & 2.0 & 1.8 & 0.16 & 3.26 & 78.8 @xmath24 3.1 & 60.6 @xmath24 4.5 & 33.4 @xmath24 9.6 + m30r25n & 0.30 & 2.5 & 2.1 & 0.23 & 3.10 & 79.8 @xmath24 1.5 & 68.5 @xmath24 1.4 & 16.8 @xmath24 2.8 + m30r30n & 0.30 & 3.0 & 2.1 & 0.31 & 3.02 & 78.4 @xmath24 2.8 & 75.1 @xmath24 0.9 & 4.7 @xmath24 3.9 + m30r35n & 0.30 & 3.5 & 2.1 & 0.39 & 2.90 & 80.8 @xmath24 0.3 & 79.3 @xmath24 0.5 & 2.2 @xmath24 0.2 + m60r15n & 0.60 & 1.5 & 1.4 & 0.14 & 3.42 & 81.0 @xmath24 3.3 & 52.6 @xmath24 11.1 & 53.4 @xmath24 23.1 + m60r20n & 0.60 & 2.0 & 1.3 & 0.28 & 3.18 & 79.2 @xmath24 3.1 & 70.7 @xmath24 1.1 & 12.8 @xmath24 5.7 + m60r25n & 0.60 & 2.5 & 1.3 & 0.41 & 3.02 & 79.3 @xmath24 3.4 & 74.8 @xmath24 1.9 & 6.9 @xmath24 5.0 + m60r30n & 0.60 & 3.0 & 1.9 & 0.54 & 2.92 & @xmath25 & @xmath25 & @xmath25 + m60r35n & 0.60 & 3.5 & 1.9 & 0.67 & 2.88 & @xmath25 & @xmath25 & @xmath25    the gaseous disk is placed under the external gravitational potential @xmath26 consisting of four components : a stellar disk , a stellar bulge , a non - axisymmetric stellar bar , and a central bh .",

    "note that @xmath14 decreases with increasing @xmath3 in both numerical and observational results , although @xmath14 in the simulations corresponds roughly to the lower envelope of the observational results .",
    "note also that our numerical results are unable to reproduce the scatter seen in the observations .",
    "these quantitative differences of @xmath14 between our numerical work and the work of @xcite are likely due to the differences in the spatial ranges of dust lanes where @xmath14 is measured .",
    "@xcite considered a constant - curvature range that varies from galaxy to galaxy , while we fix the position angles of both ends of the range .",
    "also , the fact that the parameter space covered by our models is very limited ( i.e. , fixed sound speed , @xmath37 ferrers bar potential , no magnetic field , etc . ) may also be partly responsible for the differences between our numerical results and the observations .",
    "@xcite further noted that there is a large spread of @xmath14 for given @xmath3 . to find the origin of the spread , they ran a large number of numerical simulations with differing bar and bulge parameters , and found that the spread in @xmath14 can be reduced if the aspect ratio @xmath2 is considered together with @xmath3 when fitting the curvatures .",
    "we similarly found that a linear combination of @xmath3 and @xmath2 provides a better fit than @xmath3 alone , although @xmath14 decreases with increasing @xmath2 in our fit ( eq . ) , while @xmath14 is an increasing function of @xmath2 in their fit ( eq .  [ 3 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy is again thought of as arising from the differences in the ranges of dust lanes where @xmath14 is measured and from the limited range of the parameter space in our models , as mentioned above .",
    "_ 3 . nuclear rings : size _  the shocked gas moving in toward the central regions along the dust lanes has so large a speed that the bar torque can not stop its motion across the ilr .",
    "the inflowing gas keeps moving in and eventually forms a nuclear ring at the location where the centrifugal force balances the external gravitational force .",
    "the mean radius of a ring in our models is generally smaller than the ilr location , and decreases systematically with increasing @xmath3 ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : rring_a ] ] and [ [ eq : rring_ilr ] ] ) . by making the total gravitatioal potential deeper",
    ", self - gravity makes the ring larger in size by @xmath304 , with larger values corresponding to lager @xmath3 .",
    "combined with the results of paper i that showed that the ring position is insensitive to the mass of a central bh ( and thus to the number and locations of ilrs ) , this clearly evidences that the ring position is not determined by the resonant interactions of gas with the underlying gravitational potential but rather by the amount of angular momentum loss at the dust - lane shocks .",
    "@xcite also presented the sizes of nuclear rings in their sample of barred spiral galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_ring]b compares their results ( star symbols ) with our simulation outcomes ( squares with errorbars ) on the @xmath305@xmath3 plane .",
    "both observational and numerical results show that @xmath305 becomes smaller with increasing @xmath3 , indicating that stronger bars can possess smaller rings . for @xmath306 , the agreement between observational and numerical results",
    "is quite good . for @xmath82 , on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath305 in our models corresponds roughly to the upper envelope of the observational results for given @xmath3 .",
    "this is presumably because our numerical models are unmagnetized : inclusion of magnetic fields efficiently removes angular momentum further at dust - lane shocks , which makes the ring size smaller by a factor of @xmath307 when magnetic fields have an equipartition strength with the thermal energy @xcite .",
    "a larger effective sound speed can additionally make the rings smaller ( paper i ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite measured the ring radii for a sample of 13 barred / unbarred galaxies that contain star - forming nuclear rings : their results for 8 galaxies whose bar sizes are given in @xcite are plotted in figure [ fig : comp_ring]b as triangles .",
    "@xcite argued that the ring size is well correlated with the compactness @xmath308 , where @xmath309 is the turnover radius of the rotation curve that has the velocity @xmath310 at the flat part , such that more compact ( with smaller turnover radius ) galaxies have a smaller ring . in our galaxy models , however , @xmath311 and @xmath312 , insensitive to @xmath3 and @xmath2 , while the variation of the ring size with @xmath3 is about by a factor of @xmath307@xmath313 .",
    "since the sample galaxies in @xcite also exhibit a positive correlation between @xmath314 and @xmath3 , the negative correlation between @xmath314 and @xmath152 in their results may simply be a reflection of a more intrinsic negative correlation between @xmath152 and @xmath3 .",
    "of course , our current models with a limited range of the parameters can not address the effects of @xmath314 on the ring size .",
    "_ 4 . nuclear rings : shape _  not all the rings have a conventional shape similar to @xmath9-orbits in our models unless self - gravity is included . in non - self - gravitating models with @xmath315 and @xmath316",
    ", the inflowing gas can not settle on @xmath9-orbits since they have too small kinetic energy .",
    "the ring material instead takes on an inclined orbit in between @xmath8- and @xmath9-families .",
    "an inclined ring in these models becomes smaller and more eccentric as low angular - momentum gas is added from outside .",
    "it loses much of its mass through the inner boundary when its short axis moves close to the center . due to the bar torque , the inclined ring precesses slowly to align its long axis parallel to the bar major axis , eventually forming an @xmath8-type ring",
    ". strong self - gravity of an inclined ring provides additional non - axisymmetric torque that prevents the precession of an inclined ring , leading instead to an @xmath9-type ring in self - gravitating models .    when @xmath104 or @xmath317 , on the other hand , the @xmath9-family of closed orbits near the center have sufficiently large kinetic energy that the inflowing gas along the dust lanes can transit easily to one of them in both non - self - gravitating and self - gravitating models .",
    "these rings are eccentric with an ellipticity of @xmath205@xmath206 insensitive to @xmath3 , which is within the range of the observed ring ellipticities , @xmath318@xmath319 , reported by @xcite and @xcite . again",
    ", magnetic fields are expected to circularize nuclear rings @xcite .",
    "nuclear spirals _  well - defined twin - armed nuclear spirals grow only in models in which the nuclear ring is of the @xmath9-type and sufficiently large in size : they would otherwise be destroyed by the ring material on highly eccentric orbits . even in models with an @xmath9-type ring ,",
    "nuclear spirals are absent if the ring is so small to limit their spatial extent .",
    "all nuclear spirals in our models are trailing and logarithmic in shape .",
    "while the shapes of dust lanes and nuclear rings do not change much with time after the potential is fully turned on , nuclear spirals are not stationary over the course of the entire evolution .",
    "they initially start out as being tightly wound and weak , and then gradually unwind and become stronger until turning into shocks .",
    "this unwinding and growth of nuclear spirals appears to be a generic property of nonlinear waves that become more nonlinear as they propagate inward @xcite .",
    "the unwinding rate is lower in self - gravitating models than in non - self - gravitating models . since nuclear spirals",
    "grow and unwind faster as @xmath3 increases , the probability of having more tightly - wound and weaker spirals is larger for galaxies with a weaker bar torque .",
    "this is consistent with the observational results of @xcite who found that tightly wound spirals are found primarily in weakly barred galaxies , while loosely wound spirals are more common in strongly barred galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also found that grand - design nuclear spirals in strongly barred galaxies does not extend all the way into the nucleus , which is consistent with our numerical results that show that nuclear spirals cease to exist by turning into shocks , and this happens earlier in higher-@xmath3 models .",
    "mass inflow rates _  in our models , the mass inflow rate to through the inner boundary is found to be @xmath320 for models with @xmath11 regardless of the presence of self - gravity . without self - gravity ,",
    "models with @xmath13 but with an @xmath9-type ring still have @xmath321 , since most of the inflowing gas is trapped in the ring . if the inflowing gas moves all the way to a central bh , these values of @xmath16 correspond to the eddington ratio @xmath322@xmath323 ( paper i ) , potentially explaining low - luminosity seyfert 1 agns .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . here ,",
    "@xmath324 and @xmath325 denote the bolometric and eddington luminosities of an agn , respectively , and 10% of the mass - to - energy conversion efficiency of the accreted material is assumed .",
    "some of our numerical models exhibit unrealistically large mass inflow rates .",
    "non - self - gravitating models in which the central regions are dominated by the gas on @xmath8-orbits are found to have @xmath326 and sometimes as large as @xmath291 when the ring gas on eccentric orbits is accreted directly to the inner boundary . in self - gravitating models with @xmath13 , on the other hand , rings are unstable to form high - density clumps with mass @xmath185",
    ". these clumps sometimes plunge into the central hole , causing the mass inflow rate to fluctuate with large amplitudes .",
    "we finally remark some caveats associated with @xmath16 obtained in our simulations and in interpreting it as a mass accretion rate to a central bh .",
    "first , @xmath16 from self - gravitating models are definitely more realistic that that from non - self0gravitating models .",
    "still , models m60r30 g and m60r35 g can not be applied to real galaxies since they do not posses well - defined nuclear rings : the bar in these models is perhaps too massive or too elongated , or the ferrers prolate bar is not a good representation of realistic bars .",
    "second , as mentioned earlier , @xmath16 measured is the rate of gas mass that goes in through the inner boundary .",
    "this is likely to be an upper limit to the real accretion rate to the bh since some of the inflowing mass changes its orbit before reaching the bh and can possibly come out of the inner boundary .",
    "third , high - density clumps produced by gravitational instability of nuclear rings would undergo star formation , reducing gas content in the rings .",
    "ensuing feedback would destroy them , so that the accretion of dense clumps in real situations would much less frequent than in our simulations .",
    "fourth , a circumnuclear disk with starburst activities can make the accretion rate to the bh much smaller than @xmath16 ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "fifth , while magnetic fields are known to enhance @xmath16 considerably @xcite , they would suppress or reduce gravitational instability of nuclear rings , which tends to reduce @xmath16 . in order to properly evaluate the mass accretion rates , therefore , it is required to run more realistic models of barred galaxies including star formation , feedback , magnetic fields , and other physical processes that affect gaseous features and gas inflows in the nuclear regions .",
    "we acknowledge helpful and stimulating comments from s.  comern , j.  knapen , and p.  martini , and a thoughtful report from the referee .",
    "we are also grateful to r.  shetty and e.ostriker for sharing their self - gravity solver based on the kalnajs method .",
    "this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korean government ( mest ) , no.2010 - 0000712 .",
    "in this appendix , we provide analytic expressions for the bar strength @xmath3 and the radius @xmath4 of the maximum bar torque for a galaxy with an @xmath37 prolate ferrer bar , whose density distribution is given by equation ( [ eq : bar ] ) .",
    "the eccentricity of the bar is @xmath327 .",
    "since the maximum bar torque always occurs inside the bar , it is sufficient to consider the interior ( i.e. , @xmath328 ) gravitational potential of the bar .    following the procedures presented by @xcite for triaxial ellipsoids and by @xcite for prolate spheroids , one can show that the interior potential of a ferrers bar with @xmath37 at the @xmath35 plane is given by @xmath329 with the coefficients @xmath330 @xmath331 = \\frac{a_3}{ab^2},\\ ] ] @xmath332 = \\frac{a_1}{ab^2},\\ ] ] @xmath333 @xmath334 and @xmath335 note that @xmath336 , @xmath337 , and @xmath338 in equations ( [ eq:00 ] )  ( [ eq:01 ] ) are identical to the dimensionless coefficients for the gravitational potential of uniform spheroids tabulated in table 2.1 of @xcite .    the gravitational force in the azimuthal direction due to the @xmath37 prolate",
    "is then given by @xmath339 where @xmath340 it can be easily verified that @xmath341 and @xmath342 for @xmath343 . in the limit of @xmath344 , @xmath345 , while @xmath346 .      for galaxies with a constant rotational velocity @xmath310 ,",
    "the radial gravitational force is @xmath351 .",
    "therefore , the bar strength parameter defined in equation ( [ eq : qb ] ) becomes @xmath352 which is attained at @xmath353 and @xmath354 , or at the radius @xmath355 let @xmath356 denote the total galaxy mass within @xmath357 .",
    "assuming that the galaxy mass is dominated by the bulge and the bar inside @xmath358 , it then follows that @xmath359 figure [ fig : qb_rmax ] plots @xmath3 and @xmath4 in equations ( [ eq : qbana ] ) and ( [ eq : rmax ] ) as dotted lines , which is not much different from the true bar strength that does not assume flat rotation .",
