    "spin glasses are prototypical models for disordered systems , which provide a rich source of challenging theoretical and computational problems . despite ongoing research over the last two to three decades",
    "little is known about the nature of the spin - glass state , in particular at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "hence numerical studies at low and zero temperature are of paramount importance .",
    "one of the most interesting but also most numerically challenging spin - glass models is the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) spin glass  @xcite , in which interactions between spins have infinite range .",
    "the model has the advantage that analytical solutions exist @xcite for certain low - temperature properties .",
    "still , certain properties of the model are poorly understood .",
    "for example , the behavior of the ground - state energy fluctuations as a function of the number of spins is still a source of controversy : crisanti _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found @xmath0 , whereas bouchaud _",
    "_ @xcite and aspelmeier _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found @xmath1 .",
    "numerically , for small system sizes , katzgraber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have found @xmath2 in agreement with results of palassini.@xcite the aforementioned results by katzgraber _",
    "_  have recently been criticized by billoire @xcite due to the use of too small system sizes .",
    "therefore , it would be of interest to estimate the ground - state energy fluctuations for large system sizes using reliable ground - state instances .    in optimization ,",
    "even spin glasses arranged on finite - dimensional lattices have proven to represent an interesting class of challenging problems and various evolutionary algorithms have been shown to locate ground states of large finite - dimensional spin - glass instances efficiently and reliably @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , only little work has been done in solving instances of the general sk model , which is inherently more complex than spin - glass models arranged on finite - dimensional lattices , such as the two - dimensional ( 2d ) or three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice .",
    "this paper applies the hierarchical bayesian optimization ( hboa ) and the genetic algorithm ( ga ) to the problem of finding ground states of random instances of the sk spin glass with ising spins and gaussian couplings .",
    "nonetheless , the proposed approach can be readily applied to other variants of the sk spin - glass model .",
    "several approaches based on hboa to solving large sk spin - glass instances are proposed and empirically analyzed .",
    "while the paper only presents the results on systems of up to @xmath3 spins , we argue that the proposed approach can be scaled to much larger systems , especially with the use of additional efficiency enhancement techniques .",
    "performance of hboa is compared to that of ga with several common variation operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ section - algorithms ] outlines the evolutionary algorithms discussed in this paper . section  [ section - spin - glass ] describes the problem of finding ground states of sk spin glasses and the branch - and - bound algorithm , which can be used for finding ground states of small sk instances .",
    "section  [ section - initial - experiments ] presents initial experimental results obtained with hboa on spin glasses of up to @xmath4 spins .",
    "section  [ section - how - to - bigger ] describes several approaches to reliably identifying ground states of sk spin - glass instances intractable with branch and bound .",
    "section  [ section - experiments - larger ] presents and discusses experimental results obtained with hboa on spin glasses of @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "section  [ section - experiments - comparison ] compares performance of hboa and ga with common variation operators on sk instances of @xmath6 spins .",
    "section  [ section - future - work ] outlines future work .",
    "finally , section  [ section - conclusions ] summarizes and concludes the paper .",
    "this section outlines the optimization algorithms discussed in this paper : ( 1 ) the hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm ( hboa )  @xcite and ( 2 ) the genetic algorithm ( ga )  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the section describes the deterministic hill climber ( dhc )  @xcite , which is incorporated into both algorithms to improve their performance .",
    "candidate solutions are assumed to be represented by binary strings of @xmath7 bits , although all presented methods can be easily applied to problems with candidate solutions represented by fixed - length strings over any finite alphabet .",
    "the hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm ( hboa )  @xcite evolves a population of candidate solutions .",
    "the population is initially generated at random according to the uniform distribution over all @xmath7-bit strings .",
    "each iteration starts by selecting a population of promising solutions using any common selection method of genetic and evolutionary algorithms ; in this paper , we use binary tournament selection .",
    "binary tournament selection selects one solution at a time by first choosing two random candidate solutions from the current population and then selecting the best solution out of this subset .",
    "random tournaments are repeated until the selected population has the same size as the original population and thus each candidate solution is expected to participate in two tournaments .",
    "new solutions are generated by building a bayesian network with local structures  @xcite for the selected solutions and sampling from the probability distribution encoded by the built bayesian network .",
    "to ensure useful - diversity maintenance , the new candidate solutions are incorporated into the original population using restricted tournament replacement ( rtr )  @xcite .",
    "the run is terminated when some user - defined termination criteria are met ; for example , the run may be terminated when a previously specified maximum number of iterations has been executed .",
    "hboa is an estimation of distribution algorithm ( eda )  @xcite .",
    "edas  also called probabilistic model - building genetic algorithms ( pmbgas )  @xcite and iterated density estimation algorithms ( ideas )  @xcite  differ from genetic algorithms by replacing standard variation operators of genetic algorithms such as crossover and mutation by building a probabilistic model of promising solutions and sampling the built model to generate new candidate solutions .",
    "the genetic algorithm ( ga )  @xcite also evolves a population of candidate solutions typically represented by fixed - length binary strings .",
    "the first population is generated at random .",
    "each iteration starts by selecting promising solutions from the current population ; also in ga we use binary tournament selection .",
    "new solutions are created by applying variation operators to the population of selected solutions .",
    "specifically , crossover is used to exchange bits and pieces between pairs of candidate solutions and mutation is used to perturb the resulting solutions .",
    "here we use two - point crossover or uniform crossover , and bit - flip mutation  @xcite .",
    "the new candidate solutions are incorporated into the original population using restricted tournament replacement ( rtr )  @xcite .",
    "the run is terminated when termination criteria are met .    the only difference between the hboa and ga variants discussed in this paper is the way in which the selected solutions are processed to generate new candidate solutions .      incorporating local search often improves efficiency of evolutionary algorithms .",
    "for example , in the problem of finding ground states of instances of the 2d spin glass , incorporating a simple deterministic hill climber ( dhc ) into hboa leads to a speedup of approximately a factor 10 with respect to the number of evaluations until optimum  @xcite .",
    "that is why we decided to incorporate dhc into both hboa and ga also in this study .",
    "dhc takes a candidate solution represented by an @xmath7-bit binary string on input .",
    "then , it performs one - bit changes on the solution that lead to the maximum improvement of solution quality .",
    "dhc is terminated when no single - bit flip improves solution quality and the solution is thus locally optimal with respect to single - bit flips . here",
    ", dhc is used to improve every solution in the population before the evaluation is performed .",
    "this section describes the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) spin glass and the branch - and - bound algorithm , which can be used to find ground states of sk spin - glass instances of relatively small size .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick spin glass  @xcite is described by a set of spins @xmath8 and a set of couplings @xmath9 between all pairs of spins .",
    "thus , unlike in finite - dimensional spin - glass models , the sk model does not limit the range of spin - spin interactions to only neighbors in a lattice . for the classical ising model",
    ", each spin @xmath10 can be in one of two states : @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "note that this simplification corresponds to highly anisotropic physical magnetic systems ; nevertheless , the two - state ising model comprises all basic effects also found in more realistic models of magnetic systems with more degrees of freedom .",
    "for a set of coupling constants @xmath9 , and a configuration of spins @xmath13 , the energy can be computed as @xmath14 the usual task in statistical physics is to integrate a known function over all possible configurations of spins for given coupling constants , assuming the boltzmann distribution of spin configurations . from the physics point of view",
    ", it is also interesting to know the ground states ( spin configurations associated with the minimum possible energy ) . finding extremal energies then corresponds to sampling the boltzmann distribution with temperature approaching @xmath15 .",
    "the problem of finding ground states is np - complete even when the interactions are limited only to neighbors in a 3d lattice  @xcite ; the sk spin glass is thus certainly np - complete ( unless we severely restrict couplings , making the problem simpler ) .    in order to obtain thermodynamically",
    "relevant quantities , all measurements of a spin - glass system have to be averaged over many disorder instances of random spin - spin couplings . here",
    "we consider random instances of the sk model with couplings generated from the gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance , @xmath16 .",
    "the branch - and - bound algorithm for finding ground states of sk spin - glass instances is based on a total enumeration of the space of all spin configurations .",
    "the space of spin configurations is explored by parsing a tree in which each level corresponds to one spin and the subtrees below the nodes at this level correspond to the different values this spin can obtain ( for example , the left subtree sets the spin to @xmath17 and the right subtree sets the spin to @xmath18 ) . to make the enumeration more efficient , branch and bound uses bounds on the energy to cut large parts of the tree , which can be proved to not lead to better solutions than the best solution found .",
    "we have tried two versions of the branch - and - bound algorithm for finding ground states of sk spin glasses . here",
    "we outline the basic principle of the branch and bound that performed best , which was adopted from references  @xcite .    to understand the energy bounds and the basic procedure of the branch - and - bound strategy employed in this paper , let us define a reduced problem which considers only the first @xmath19 spins and all couplings between these spins .",
    "let us denote the minimum energy for this reduced system by @xmath20 .",
    "let us now consider the problem of setting the last spin , @xmath21 , which was excluded in the reduced system .",
    "we know that the optimal energy @xmath22 of the full problem has to satisfy the following inequality : @xmath23 because @xmath20 is the minimum energy for the reduced system of only the first @xmath19 spins and the largest decrease of energy by adding @xmath21 into the reduced system is given by the sum of the absolute values of all the couplings between @xmath21 and other spins .",
    "analogously , we can define a reduced system with only the first @xmath24 spins for any @xmath25 , and denote the minimum energy for such a system by @xmath26 .",
    "then , the bound from equation  [ eq - bound - fn ] can be generalized as @xmath27    the branch - and - bound algorithm for an sk spin glass of @xmath7 spins @xmath28 proceeds by iteratively finding the best configurations for the first @xmath29 to @xmath7 spins . for each value of @xmath24 ,",
    "the result for @xmath30 is used to provide the bounds . whenever the current branch can be shown to provide at most as good solutions as the best solution so far",
    ", the branch is cut ( and not explored ) .    while it is somewhat surprising that solving @xmath19 problems is faster than a direct solution of the entire problem , the iterative branch - and - bound strategy is clearly superior to other alternatives and allows feasible solutions for much larger sk instances . with the described approach",
    ", ground states of sk instances of up to approximately 90 spins can be found in practical time on a reasonable sequential computer .    to make the branch - and - bound algorithm slightly faster",
    ", we first execute several runs of a stochastic hill climbing to provide a relatively good spin configurations for each reduced problem .",
    "the best result of these runs allows the branch - and - bound technique to cut more branches .",
    "this section describes initial experiments . as the first step",
    ", we generated a large number of random problem instances of the sk spin - glass model of sizes up to @xmath4 spins and applied the branch - and - bound algorithm to find the ground states of these instances .",
    "next , hboa was applied to all these problem instances and the performance and parameters of hboa were analyzed .",
    "first , we have generated @xmath32 sk ground - state instances for each problem size from @xmath33 spins to @xmath4 spins with step 2 .",
    "branch and bound has been applied to each of these instances to determine the true ground state , providing us with a set of 310,000 unique problem instances of different sizes with known ground states .",
    "the motivation for using so many instances for each problem size and for increasing the problem size with the step of only 2 was that the problem difficulty varies significantly across the different instances and we wanted to obtain accurate statistical information about the performance of hboa and its parameters ; as a result , it was desirable to obtain as many different problem instances as possible . since both branch and bound as well as",
    "hboa can solve such small sk instances very fast , generating and testing 10,000 instances for each problem size was feasible with the computational resources available .      to represent spin configurations of @xmath7 spins",
    ", hboa uses an @xmath7-bit binary string where the @xmath34-th bit determines the state of the spin @xmath10 ; @xmath17 is represented with a  @xmath35 , @xmath18 is represented with a  @xmath36 .",
    "each candidate solution is assigned fitness according to the energy of the spin configuration it encodes ; specifically , the fitness is equal to the negative energy of the configuration . in this manner",
    ", maximizing fitness corresponds to minimizing energy and the maximal fitness corresponds to the ground - state energy of the system .",
    "some hboa parameters do not depend much on the problem instance being solved , and that is why they are typically set to some default values , which were shown to perform well across a broad range of problems .",
    "to select promising solutions , we use binary tournament selection .",
    "new solutions are incorporated into the original population using restricted tournament replacement with window size @xmath37 where @xmath7 is the number of bits in a candidate solution and @xmath38 is the population size .",
    "bayesian networks are selected based on the bayesian - dirichlet metric with likelihood equivalence  @xcite , which is extended with a penalty term to punish overly complex models  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of bayesian networks used in hboa was not restricted directly and it only depends on the scoring metric and the training data .",
    "the best values of two hboa parameters critically depend on the problem being solved : ( 1 )  the population size and ( 2 )  the maximum number of iterations .",
    "the maximum number of iterations is typically set to be proportional to the number of bits in the problem , which is supported by the domino convergence model for exponentially scaled problems  @xcite . since from some preliminary experiments it was clear that the number of iterations would be very small for all problems of @xmath31 , typically less than @xmath39 even for @xmath4 , we set the number of iterations to the number of bits in the problem . experiments confirmed that the used bound on the number of iterations was certainly sufficient .    to set the population size ,",
    "we have used the bisection method  @xcite , which automatically determines the necessary population size for reliable convergence to the optimum in @xmath39 out of @xmath39 independent runs .",
    "this is done for each problem instance so that the resulting population sizes are as small as possible , which typically minimizes the execution time .",
    "each run in the bisection is terminated either when the global optimum ( ground state ) has been reached ( success ) , or when the maximum number of iterations has been exceeded without finding the global optimum ( failure ) .",
    "for each problem instance , after determining an adequate population size with bisection and making 10 independent runs of hboa with that population size , we record four important statistics for these 10 successful runs : ( 1 ) the population size , ( 2 ) the number of iterations , ( 3 ) the number of evaluations , and ( 4 ) the number of single - bit flips of the local searcher . for each problem size , we thus consider 100,000 successful hboa runs , yielding a total of 3,100,000 successful hboa runs for problems of sizes from @xmath33 to @xmath4 . in order to solve larger problems , especially the results for the population size and the number of iterations",
    "are useful . on the other hand , to analyze the time complexity of hboa , the number of evaluations and the number of flips are most important .    the first step in analyzing the results of hboa is to identify the probability distribution that the different observed statistics follow . by identifying a specific distribution type",
    ", the results of the analysis should be much more accurate and practically useful . based on our prior work in spin glasses and preliminary experiments , there are two distributions that might be applicable : ( 1 ) the log - normal distribution and ( 2 ) the generalized extreme value distribution . for",
    "all aforementioned statistics we first estimate the parameters of both the distributions and then compare these estimates to the underlying data .",
    "the most stable results are obtained with the log - normal distribution and that is why we have decided to use log - normal distributions in this and further analyses .",
    "figure  [ fig - distributions - small ] illustrates the match between the estimated log - normal distribution and the experimental data for the population size , the number of iterations , the number of evaluations , and the number of flips for @xmath4 .",
    "analogous matches were found for smaller problem sizes .",
    "figure  [ fig - mean - stdev - small ] shows the mean and standard deviation of the distribution estimates for the entire range of sk instances from @xmath33 to @xmath4 with step 2 .",
    "the results indicate that while the population size appears to grow only polynomially fast , the remaining quantities appear to grow exponentially fast , which is mirrored by the estimates of the number of iterations .",
    "nonetheless , for the number of iterations , a significant factor influencing the rate of growth is that the average number of iterations for small problems is close to @xmath36 and the number of iterations has to be always at least @xmath36 ; therefore , only the results for larger problems will provide a clear indication of how fast the number of iterations actually grows on average . furthermore , it is important to not only study the mean statistics , but also to analyze the tails of the estimated distributions .",
    "this is especially necessary for problems like mean - field sk spin glasses for which the difficulty of problem instances varies significantly and , as a result , while many instances are relatively easy , solving the most difficult instances becomes especially challenging .     +   +   +     +   +   +",
    "to make sure that hboa finds a ground state reliably , it is necessary to set the population size and the maximum number of iterations to sufficiently large values .",
    "the larger the population size and the number of iterations , the more likely hboa finds the optimum . of course",
    ", as the problem size increases , the population - sizing and time - to - convergence requirements will increase as well , just like was indicated by the initial results presented in the previous section .",
    "in this section we present three approaches to reliably locate the ground states of sk spin - glass instances unsolvable with the branch - and - bound algorithm .",
    "the first two approaches are based on the statistical models of the population size and the number of iterations for smaller problem instances , such as those developed in the previous section . on the other hand",
    ", the last approach does not require any statistical model or prior experiments , although it still requires an estimate of the upper bound on the maximum number of iterations .",
    "the proposed approaches are not limited to the sk spin - glass model and can thus be used to reliably identify the global optima of other difficult problems .",
    "the first approach is based on modeling the growth of the percentiles of the estimated probability distributions . as the input , we use the estimated distributions of the population size and the number of iterations for spin - glass instances of sizes @xmath31 .    for each problem size",
    "@xmath7 , we first compute the @xmath40 percentile of the population - size model so that it is ensured that the resulting population sizes will be sufficiently large for all but the @xmath41 most difficult instances . then , we approximate the growth of the @xmath40 percentile and use this approximation to predict sufficient population sizes for larger problems . since the estimation of the growth function is also subject to error , we can use a @xmath42 confidence bound for the new predictions and choose the upper bound given by this confidence bound .",
    "an analogous approach can then be used for the number of iterations .",
    "of course , the two confidence bounds involved in this approach can be changed and the estimation should be applicable regardless of the model used to fit the distribution of the population size and the number of iterations ; nonetheless , it is important to build an accurate approximation of the true distribution of the population sizes in order to have an accurate enough approximation of the chosen percentile .",
    "furthermore , it is important to use an appropriate growth function to predict the percentiles in order to minimize the errors for predicting the parameters for bigger problems .",
    "the same approach can be used to predict the population size and the number of iterations for any population - based evolutionary algorithm , such as the genetic algorithm and evolution strategies .",
    "furthermore , when applied to other types of stochastic optimization algorithms , other parameters may be modeled accordingly .",
    "for example , if we were using simulated annealing , we could model the rate of the temperature decrease .",
    "the left - hand side of figure  [ fig - modeling - percentiles-80 ] shows the percentiles for the population size and the number of iterations obtained from the log - normal distribution estimates for @xmath31 presented in the previous section , and the best - fit curves estimating the growth of these percentiles created with the matlab curve - fitting toolbox .",
    "best approximation of the growth of both the quantities is obtained with a power - law fit of the form @xmath43 where @xmath7 is the number of bits ( spins ) .",
    "the estimated parameters of the best power - law fit of the population - size percentiles are shown below ( adjusted @xmath44 of the estimate is @xmath45 ) :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we use the above model to predict adequate values of the population size and the number of iterations for @xmath3 , @xmath46 for the population size and @xmath47 for the number of iterations , respectively .",
    "the predictions for problems @xmath48 are shown in figure  [ fig - modeling - percentiles-200 ] ( right - hand side ) .",
    "+      to solve even larger problem instances , we generate @xmath50 random instances of the sk spin glass of @xmath3 bits .",
    "these instances are then solved using hboa with the population size set according to the upper limit estimated in the previous section from problems of sizes @xmath6 .",
    "similarly as in the experiments for @xmath51 $ ] , hboa is run 10 times on each problem instance and the best solution found in these 10 runs is recorded .",
    "then , we run bisection 10 times on each problem instance , resulting in 100 successful runs for each problem instance ( 10 successful hboa runs for each of the 10 bisection runs ) .    after analyzing the distribution of the various statistics collected from hboa runs on spin - glass instances of @xmath3 spins , it became clear that while for smaller problems , the log - normal distribution provided an accurate and stable model of the true distribution , for @xmath3 , the fit with the log - normal distribution does no longer seem to be the best option and the distribution is more accurately reflected by the generalized extremal value distribution .",
    "this is surprising , since the log - normal fits for smaller problems are very accurate and they provide more stable results than the generalized extreme value fits . as presented in reference  @xcite the thermodynamic limiting behavior of the sk model is only probed for @xmath52 spins .",
    "interestingly , this threshold agrees qualitatively with the change of the fitting functions .",
    "to verify our previous estimates based on the log - normal distribution , we repeated the same procedure with the generalized extreme value distribution .",
    "this resulted in somewhat larger upper bounds on the population size .",
    "we are currently verifying all problem instances with these new estimates for @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , we are running the approach based on population doubling ( see section  [ section - population - doubling ] ) for all instances with @xmath5 $ ] so that we have further support for the global optimality of the spin configurations found with the initial approach .",
    "so far , we havent found any instances for which a better solution would be found with larger populations or the population - doubling approach .",
    "this section compares the performance of hboa , ga with two - point crossover and bit - flip mutation , and ga with uniform crossover and bit - flip mutation .",
    "all algorithms are configured in the same way except for the population size , which is obtained separately for each problem instance and each algorithm using the bisection method described earlier in the paper .    to compare algorithms ` @xmath53 ' and ` @xmath54 , ' we first compute the ratio of the number of evaluations required by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , separately for each problem instance .",
    "then , we average these ratios over all instances of the same problem size . if the ratio is greater than @xmath36 , the algorithm @xmath54 requires fewer evaluations than the algorithm @xmath53 ; therefore , with respect to the number of fitness evaluations , we can conclude that @xmath54 is better than @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , if the ratio is smaller than @xmath36 , then we can conclude that with respect to the number of evaluations , @xmath53 performs better than @xmath54 .",
    "analogous ratios are also computed for the number of flips required until the optimum has been reached , which provides us with an even more important measure of computational complexity than the number of evaluations .",
    "the results of pair - wise comparisons between all three algorithms are shown in figure  [ fig - comparison ] .",
    "the results clearly indicate that hboa outperforms both ga variants and the gap between hboa and the ga variants increases with problem size .",
    "therefore , for larger problems , the performance differences can be expected to grow further . from the comparison of the two ga variants",
    ", it is clear that while with respect to the number of evaluations , two - point crossover performs better , with respect to the number of flips , uniform crossover performs better with increasing problem size .",
    "while the differences between hboa and ga are not as significant for problem sizes considered in this work , since the gap between these algorithms grows with problem size , for much larger problem , the differences can be expected to become significant enough to make ga variants intractable on problems solvable with hboa in practical time .",
    "the most immediate milestone to tackle is to further increase the size of the systems for which we can reliably identify ground states with the ultimate goal of obtaining global optima for sk instances significantly larger than @xmath55 spins .",
    "one approach is to directly use the methods discussed in this paper and incrementally increase problem size .",
    "although hboa performs very well on the systems we have tested so far , since the problem of finding ground states of sk spin - glass instances is np - complete , the time complexity is expected to grow very fast , especially on the most difficult problem instances .",
    "that is why one of the important precursors of future success in achieving this goal is to incorporate existing efficiency enhancement techniques  @xcite into hboa and design new efficiency enhancement techniques tailored to the sk spin - glass model .",
    "one of the most promising directions for improving hboa performance is hybridization , where instead of the simple deterministic hill climber , more advanced techniques can be incorporated ; this can significantly increase the size of problems solvable by hboa with practical time complexity , done similarly for 2d and 3d spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "another interesting topic for future work is to use problem instances obtained in this research to test other optimization algorithms and compare their performance with that of hboa and ga .",
    "good candidates for such a comparison are exchange monte carlo ( parallel tempering ) @xcite adapted for the ground - state search @xcite , genetic algorithm with triadic crossover  @xcite , extremal optimization  @xcite , and hysteric optimization  @xcite .",
    "while some of these algorithms were argued to solve relatively large sk spin - glass instances , there is no guarantee that the results obtained represent true ground states and the performance of these methods on certain classes of the sk spin - glass model is relatively poor .",
    "nonetheless , a rigorous comparison of these algorithms with the techniques studied in this paper remains an important topic for future work .",
    "finally , this work can be extended to other interesting types of instances of the sk spin - glass model and other difficult combinatorial problems .",
    "one of the extensions is to consider other distributions of couplings , where in particular , bimodal distributions are of interest due to the high degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "testing hboa to see if the method delivers all possible configurations for a given ground - state energy with the same probability is of paramount importance @xcite .",
    "another interesting extension of the model is to impose a distance metric between pairs of spins and modify the coupling distribution based on the distance between the two connected spins  @xcite .",
    "the latter has the advantage that , while the connectivity of the model is kept constant , the range of the interactions can be tuned continuously between a system in a mean - field universality class to a short - range nearest - neighbor model .",
    "this provides an ideal benchmark for optimization algorithms in general .",
    "this paper applied the hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm ( hboa ) and the genetic algorithm ( ga ) to the problem of finding ground states of instances of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) spin - glass model with ising spins and gaussian couplings , and analyzed performance of these algorithms on a large set of instances of the sk model .",
    "first , 10,000 random problem instances were generated for each problem size from @xmath33 to @xmath4 with step @xmath56 and ground states of all generated instances were determined using the branch - and - bound algorithm .",
    "then , hboa was applied to these instances , and its parameters and performance were analyzed in detail . since problems of @xmath57 spins are intractable with branch and bound , we proposed several approaches to reliably identifying ground states of such problem instances with hboa .",
    "one of the proposed approaches was applied to problem instances of sizes @xmath5 $ ] ( 1000 random instances for each problem size ) .",
    "analogous experiments as with hboa were also performed with the genetic algorithm ( ga ) with bit - flip mutation and two common crossover operators .",
    "performance of hboa and the two ga variants was compared , indicating that hboa outperforms both ga variants and the gap between these two algorithms increases with problem size .",
    "our study presents for the first time a detailed study of genetic and evolutionary algorithms applied to the problem of finding ground states of the sk spin - glass model .",

    "<S> this study focuses on the problem of finding ground states of random instances of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) spin - glass model with gaussian couplings . while the ground states of sk spin - glass instances can be obtained with branch and bound , the computational complexity of branch and bound yields instances of not more than about 90 spins . </S>",
    "<S> we describe several approaches based on the hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm ( hboa ) to reliably identifying ground states of sk instances intractable with branch and bound , and present a broad range of empirical results on such problem instances . </S>",
