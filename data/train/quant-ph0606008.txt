    "the combination of the principles in quantum mechanics and the theory of information produces some novel applications , such as quantum computer and quantum communication @xcite . quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite provides a secure way for two remote parties , bob and charlie to create a private key with which they can communicate securely by using vernam one - time pad crypto - system .",
    "the non - cloning theorem and the quantum correlation of an entangled quantum system ensure the security of qkd . in 1984 ,",
    "bennett and brassard ( bb84 ) @xcite proposed an original point - to - point qkd scheme based on the non - cloning theorem .",
    "as the state of each single photon is produced by choosing randomly one of the two measuring bases ( mbs ) , the rectilinear basis @xmath1 and the diagonal basis @xmath2 , a vicious eavesdropper , eve will inevitably disturb the quantum systems and leave a mark in the results if she eavesdrops the quantum line .",
    "moreover , she can not obtain all the information about the single - photon state because an unknown quantum state can not be cloned .",
    "now , there have been some point - to - point qkd schemes proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel concept , quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) was prosed and actively pursued by some groups @xcite . with qsdc",
    ", the two authorized users , say the sender bob and the receiver charlie can exchange their secret message directly without creating a private key to encrypting the message .",
    "there are two types of qsdc schemes .",
    "one is based on entangled states , such as those in refs @xcite .",
    "the other is based on single photons .",
    "typical such qsdc protocols are the ones presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . obviously , the ones with single photons are more convenient for the users at the aspect of measurements than those with entangled states .",
    "the message in the two point - to - point qsdc protocols proposed by schimizu and imoto @xcite and beige _",
    "_ @xcite can not be read out until an additional classical bit is transmitted for each qubit .",
    "we @xcite proposed a qsdc scheme with a sequence of single photons , and cai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a qsdc protocol with a single photon following some ideas in bennett 1992 qkd protocol @xcite .",
    "a general case of practical applications of qsdc requires that an authorized user on a network can exchange the secret message directly with another one .",
    "that is , qsdc network schemes are useful in practical .",
    "there are some servers who provide the service for preparing and measuring the quantum signal for the legitimate users ( the number is much lager than that of the servers ) , which will make the quantum communication between the legitimate users more convenient than those in point - to - point qsdc protocols @xcite as it reduces the setups for the normal users , the same as that in a classical communication network .",
    "although there are a few qsdc network schemes existing based on entanglements @xcite , none with single photons . certainly , an ideal single - photon source is not available for a practical application at present , but people believe that it can be produce without difficulty in a nearly future with the development of technology @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting , in theory , to study the model for qsdc network with single photons .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an economical qsdc network scheme with single photons .",
    "the server provides the service for preparing and measuring the quantum signals , a sequence of single photons @xmath3 , which will simplify the authorized users setups for secret communication largely .",
    "different from qkd network protocols , the server first sends the quantum signals to the receiver who encrypts them with local unitary operations and then sends them to the sender .",
    "the secret message is encoded directly on the single photons after confirming their security .",
    "all the parties , including the servers , agree that the initial states of the single photons are @xmath0 , which will reduce the difficulty for the users to check eavesdropping .",
    "this qsdc network protocol is an optimal one .",
    ", @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the measurements done by alice , bob and charlie , respectively ; @xmath6-@xmath7 represent the eavesdropping done by eve in different processes . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the codes done by bob and charlie , respectively . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ f1 ]",
    "although a qsdc network is a composite system , its subsystem can be simplified to three parts , the server ( alice ) , the sender ( bob ) and the receiver ( charlie ) , similar to qkd network @xcite .",
    "that is , a great number of these subsystems compose of the whole network .",
    "similar to the classical network communication , for each request of the legitimate users , the server analyzes it and then performs a relevant operation , for example , connecting the user to another one on the network or sending a sequence of single photons to the user .",
    "moreover , all the users and the servers agree that the server of the branch with the receiver provides the service for preparing and measuring the quantum signal , and all other servers only provide the service for connecting the quantum line for these two legitimate users in a certain time slot if the sender and the receiver do not exist in a branch of the network .",
    "thus , a qsdc network scheme is explicit if the principle of its subsystem is described clearly .",
    "the subsystem in our qsdc network scheme is shown in fig.1 .",
    "alice provides the service for preparing and measuring the polarized single photons .",
    "the single photons @xmath10 are prepared initially in the same states @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is an eigenvector of the mb @xmath1 .",
    "alice sends the photons @xmath10 first to the receiver charlie who stores them and checks the security of the transmission .",
    "the procedure for checking eavesdropping includes two parts .",
    "one is used to check whether the sample photons are in the same state @xmath0 or not , which can be completed by measuring half the samples with the mb @xmath1 .",
    "the other is used to check whether there are more than one photon in each signal .",
    "that is , charlie should forbid others eavesdrop the quantum communication with a multi - photon fake signal attack @xcite .",
    "this task can be accomplished with some photon beam splitters ( pbss ) , similar to ref .",
    "@xcite . in detail , charlie splits each signal in the half of the samples remaining with three pbss , shown in fig.2 , and then measures each signal with a single - photon detector . if there is only one photon in the initial signal , only one detector will be clicked in theory . otherwise , the number of the detectors clicked is more than one with a large probability .",
    "( @xmath13 ) are four single - photon detectors .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] [ f2 ]    if the receiver charlie confirms that there is no eavesdropper monitoring the quantum line between the server and him , he operates each photon in the sequence @xmath10 with one of the two local operations @xmath14 and @xmath15 randomly .",
    "he keeps the secret about his operations @xmath9 . in order to check eavesdropping efficiently ,",
    "he should also insert some decoy photons in the sequence @xmath10 .",
    "that is , charlie picks up randomly some sample photons ( the number is not very large , just enough for doing the error rate analysis , about the number of samples for eavesdropping check in bb84 qkd protocol ) , say @xmath16 from the sequence @xmath10 after his operations with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and performs a hadamard ( @xmath19 ) operation on each one .",
    "the @xmath19 operation will make the photons in @xmath20 in the state @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "that is , the states of the photons in the sequence @xmath10 are nonorthogonal , which will forbid the eavesdroppers to eavesdrop the information on the states freely .",
    "after these operations , charlie sends the sequence @xmath23 ( the sequence @xmath10 after charlie s operations ) to the sender bob .",
    "after bob receives the sequence @xmath23 , charlie chooses randomly some photons from the sequence @xmath23 as the samples for checking eavesdropping and tells their positions to bob .",
    "the samples include all the photons operated with a @xmath19 operation @xmath20 and some other photons with only the operation @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "charlie tells bob the mbs of the samples and requires him to announce his outcomes obtained by measuring the samples with the same mbs as those of charlie s .",
    "simultaneously , bob can also use the same way as charlie s to determine whether there are more than one photons in each sample .",
    "the error rate analysis on the samples can be accomplished by the receiver charlie . that is",
    ", he compares the outcomes published by bob with his own operations on the samples . if they believe that the quantum line is secure , bob codes his secret message @xmath8 on the photons remaining in the sequence @xmath23 by choosing the operation @xmath17 or @xmath18 according to the bit is 0 or 1 , respectively .",
    "certainly , bob should add a small trick in the sequence @xmath23 before he sends it out .",
    "that is , he should select some of the photons in the sequence @xmath23 as the samples for checking the security of the transmission between him and the server alice , and operates them with @xmath17 or @xmath18 randomly .",
    "then he sends the photons encoded , say @xmath24 to alice who measures them with the mb @xmath1 .",
    "alice announces the outcomes of her measurements in public , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "after bob and charlie check eavesdropping with the photons operated by bob using @xmath17 and @xmath18 randomly , charlie can read out the secret message @xmath26 directly if the transmission of whole quantum communication is secure .",
    "in this qsdc network scheme , there are three processes for checking eavesdropping , i.e. , one for the transmission between the server alice and the receiver charlie , one between charlie and the sender bob , and the other one between bob and alice .",
    "although an eavesdropper , say eve ( including a dishonest server alice ) , can eavesdrop the quantum communication between the two parties of the transmission in each process , say @xmath6 , @xmath27 and @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the eavesdropping checks can forbid her to monitor the quantum line freely , as the process of each transmission is similar to that in bb84 qkd protocol @xcite which is proven unconditionally secure with error correction and privacy amplification @xcite .",
    "that is , eve s action will be detected by charlie and bob before bob encodes his message on the photons .    in detail , with the eavesdropping @xmath6 , eve can only obtain the information about the initial states of the photons , which is known to every one , not a secret . if eve wants to steal the information about the operations @xmath9 , she should insert some trojan - horse photons in the original signal or intercept the photons operated by charlie and measure them .",
    "obviously , her actions will inevitably leave a trace in the first or second process for eavesdropping check .",
    "the reason is that the trojan - horse photons will be found out when charlie measures the samples with some pbss as there are more than one detector clicked for each original signal received from alice .",
    "if eve exploits the intercept - resending attack to steal the information about charlie s operations @xmath9 , her action will introduce some errors in the outcomes of the measurements on the samples in the second process for eavesdropping check , the same as that in bb84 protocol @xcite .",
    "the eavesdropping on the last stage @xmath7 ( the transmission between bob and alice ) will give eve nothing about the message @xmath8 as it is encrypted by the operations @xmath9 @xcite . in a word ,",
    "eve can not steal the information about the secret message @xmath8 freely in an ideal condition .",
    "if the noise in the quantum line is not very small , the case is different .",
    "we discuss it as follows .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we can also use the relation of the error rate and the correspondent maximal amount of information obtainable for an eavesdropper from a photon with @xmath27 to demonstrate the security of the quantum channel between charlie and bob . as bob checks eavesdropping by choosing the two mbs @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the samples , the same as the bb84 qkd protocol @xcite",
    ", the eavesdropping done by eve can be realized by a unitary operation , say , @xmath28 on a larger hilbert space .",
    "that is , eve can perform the unitary transformation @xmath28 on the photon sent by charlie ( say photon @xmath29 ) and the ancilla whose state is initially in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xmath30,\\\\ \\hat{e}\\vert -x\\rangle_{c } \\vert 0\\rangle & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\sqrt{f}(\\vert 0\\rangle \\vert e_{00}\\rangle + \\vert 1\\rangle \\vert e_{11}\\rangle)\\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\sqrt{d}(\\vert 1\\rangle \\vert e_{01}\\rangle + \\vert 0\\rangle \\vert e_{10}\\rangle)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the fidelity of the state of the photon @xmath29 after the eavesdropping , @xmath32 is the probability that bob and charlie can detect eve s action . as the operation",
    "@xmath28 is a unitary one , we have the relations as follows @xmath33    after the eavesdropping check , bob encodes his message on the photons in the eigenvectors of the mb @xmath1 with the operations @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as",
    "the states of the samples are random for any eavesdropper , the photon @xmath29 is in the state @xmath34 . after the unitary operation @xmath28 , the final state of the photon @xmath35 and the ancilla @xmath36 is described as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the probabilities encoded with the operation @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are quantum operations describing the evolution of the initial state @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 the accessible information extracted from the state @xmath44 is no more than the holevo bound @xcite , i.e. , @xmath45\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & i_{max},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the von - neumann entropy of the state @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the roots of the characteristic polynomial det@xmath50 @xcite .",
    "suppose that bob chooses the same probability for choosing the two operations @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath51 , we can obtain the relation between @xmath52 and the probability @xmath32 as follows when eve measures the composite system with the basis @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 which spans the generic subspace of the hilbert space @xmath57 support of @xmath58 @xmath59 that is , the probability of being detected @xmath32 will increase if eve wants to steal more information about the secret message .",
    "if the error rate introduced by noise is not zero , bob should exploit the single - photon quantum privacy amplification method @xcite to reduce the leakage largely .      in brief",
    ", the principle of the quantum privacy amplification for two single photons can be described as follows @xcite .",
    "it includes two controlled - not ( cnot ) gates and an @xmath19 gate , shown in fig.3 .",
    "suppose the original states of the photon 1 and photon 2 are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "after the operation , the qubit 2 is measured with the mb @xmath1 and the information of its original state is incorporated into photon 1 as @xmath62 this means that the state of the control qubit @xmath63 will contain the information of the state of the original target qubit no matter what the result obtained by bob is . in this way",
    ", the probability that eve gets the complete information about the output state is reduced to @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 is the original probability that eve obtains the information about the qubits in a noisy channel .",
    "[ f3 ]    if the noise in the quantum line somewhat depolarizes the single photons , the legitimate users can purify the polarized single photons @xcite and then perform quantum privacy amplification on them for eliminating the information leaked to eve @xcite .",
    "these two operations will eliminate the effect of the noise . in this way",
    ", the security of this qsdc network scheme is as the same as that with an ideal quantum line .",
    "of course , if the noise or the loss in the quantum line is not small , this scheme is not good for transmitting the secret message directly , but for creating a private key efficiently .",
    "it is of interest to point out the advantage that the sequence @xmath10 is first sent to the receiver charlie , not the sender bob . as the secret message @xmath8",
    "can not be discarded , different from the outcomes in qkd , the users have to confirm whether the quantum line between them is secure or not @xcite .",
    "only when the quantum line is secure , the sender bob would encode his message on the quantum information carriers , a sequence of polarized single photons .",
    "the operations done by charlie @xmath9 carry nothing about the message before bob codes the photons .",
    "that is , @xmath9 is just a raw key , same as that in qkd before bob and charlie confirm the security of the transmission between them , and can be discarded .",
    "but after the confirmation is done by bob and charlie , the operations @xmath9 become the unique private key for decrypting the message @xmath8 .",
    "this order of the transmissions ensures that the message @xmath8 are not revealed to eve even though she monitors the quantum lines .",
    "moreover , the two users , in this time , can exploit quantum privacy amplification to reduce the leakage to a low level as the photons do not carry the secret message .",
    "another character of this qsdc network scheme is that the initial states prepared by the server alice are all @xmath0 .",
    "it will reduce the difficulty for the parties to check eavesdropping . in detail , bob and charlie can complete their eavesdropping check without the help of alice s , which can prevent alice from attacking the communication with a fake signal and cheating @xcite .",
    "moreover , charlie can use an @xmath19 operation to change a photon into a decoy one efficiently .",
    "compared with the qsdc network schemes existing @xcite , a sequence of polarized single photons is enough , not entanglements .",
    "the users on the network need only have the capability of performing single - photon measurement and local unitary operations , not multipartite joint measurements .",
    "moreover , it is unnecessary for the users to have an ideal single - photon source as the quantum signals are prepared by the server , which will simplify the devices of the users on the network .",
    "same as the point - to - point qsdc scheme @xcite , almost all the photons can be used to carry the useful information in theory .",
    "that is , the efficiency for qubits @xmath66 approaches 100% . except for checking eavesdropping",
    ", it is unnecessary for the users to exchange the classical information .",
    "thus this qsdc network scheme is an economical one .",
    "certainly , on the one hand , if the sender bob has a perfect device for measuring a sequence of single photons , he can send no photon to the server alice and he measures them himself in this network scheme .",
    "in this way , the server alice has more space for dealing with the request of other users. in essence , the server alice only provides the service for preparing a sequence of single photons in this modified network scheme . on the other hand ,",
    "if a perfect device for measuring single photons is very expensive in a practical application , the sender bob can send the photon sequence to the sever alice for determining their states .",
    "this structure will reduce the requirements on the users devices largely at the expense of alice s resource .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a new qsdc network scheme with a sequence of polarized single photons @xmath3 . in this scheme",
    ", the server prepares all the quantum signals initially in the same state @xmath67 , which will reduce the difficulty for the parties to check eavesdropping . after confirming the security of the single photons encrypted by the receiver",
    ", the sender encodes his secret message directly on them .",
    "after the server announces the combined operations on the photons , the receiver can read out the message directly .",
    "this scheme is an economical one as it is the easiest way for qsdc network communication securely .",
    "if the noise or the loss in the quantum line is not small , the parties can use this model for creating a private key efficiently , not exchanging the secret message .",
