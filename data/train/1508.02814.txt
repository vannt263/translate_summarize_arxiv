    "the ground state of a quantum many - body system changes drastically as parameters in the hamiltonian are driven across a quantum transition point .",
    "this phenomenon is preceded in a finite - size system by closing of the energy gap between the ground and first excited states as a function of the system size growing toward the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the rate of the gap closing is an important measure characterizing a quantum phase transition .    according to the finite - size scaling theory , when applied to a second order phase transition with a divergent correlation length , physical quantities generally behave polynomially as a function of the system size @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the gap is expected to close exponentially fast at the first order quantum phase transition : the two ground states at opposite sides of the first order transition point have significantly different properties and consequently their overlap in a finite - size system is very  typically exponentially  small .",
    "the overlap of the two states determines the energy gap since the overlap corresponds to the off - diagonal elements of the effective two - level hamiltonian describing the system around the transition point and the gap is directly related to the magnitude of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "it is therefore expected that the order of quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit is generally in one - to - one correspondence with the rate of the gap closing toward the thermodynamic limit , polynomially for the second order transition and exponentially for the first order transition @xcite .",
    "studies of the energy gap are also important from the viewpoint of quantum annealing @xcite , in which parameters of the system are controlled in time and driven across a quantum critical point .",
    "the rate of the gap closing directly affects the efficiency of quantum annealing .",
    "an exponential closing of the gap implies an exponentially long computation time whereas a polynomial gap leads to a polynomial time @xcite .",
    "although the above - mentioned correspondence between the order of quantum phase transition and the rate of the gap closing generally holds true in most systems , an interesting counterexample has been found by cabrera and jullien @xcite who showed that the first order quantum phase transition in the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model with antiperiodic boundary condition is accompanied by a polynomial closing of the energy gap .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for essentially the same result .",
    "furthermore , another very anomalous example has been given for the infinite - range quantum @xmath0 model , where the energy gap behaves in many different ways at first order quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown there that many types of the gap closing : polynomial , exponential , and even factorial closing coexist along a critical line in the phase diagram .",
    "this example suggests that we should be very careful while relating the type of quantum phase transition to the rate of the gap closing .    in the present paper ,",
    "we first analyze the one - dimensional quantum isotropic @xmath0 model with @xmath2 , which exhibits he second order phase transition , and show that this model is another example of the anomalous gap behavior . although the properties of one - dimensional quantum spin systems have been studied from a number of different perspectives @xcite , our focus is on the anomalous system - size dependence of the gap , at variance from most of the previous studies .",
    "we conclude that the energy gap behaves quite peculiarly ( highly oscillatory ) as a function of the system size , in a very similar way to the case of the infinite - range quantum @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "this observation should be taken seriously from the perspective of efficiency of quantum annealing .    next , we analyze the anisotropic @xmath0 model and",
    "show that the energy gap also behaves anomalously as a function of the system size in some regions of the parameters . finally , we observe that a direct relation holds between the energy gap and the correlation function in the ground state .",
    "for instance , the anomalous oscillatory behavior of the gap precisely coincides with the oscillations of the correlation functions .",

    "there are several important points to notice in these results .",
    "firstly , a slight change in @xmath3 can lead to drastically different behavior . in order to illustrate this , it is useful to reduce the exact formulas for the gap in eqs .",
    "( [ kekka1 ] ) and ( [ kekka2 ] ) for some specific values of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and hence @xmath97 .",

    "( [ nx2pi ] ) and the gap takes a simple form @xmath100 on the other hand , when @xmath101 , @xmath102 and for @xmath103 , @xmath104 and the gap becomes respectively @xmath105    for large @xmath10 , eqs .",
    "( [ 3l+1]-[3l+2 ] ) have the same system - size dependence since @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the gap follows essentially two separate curves as a function of the system size , given by eqs .",
    "( [ simple delta ] ) and ( [ 3l+1 ] ) ( or ( [ 3l+2 ] ) ) , as can indeed be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : initial ] for @xmath89 .",
    "a similar argument applies to @xmath107 with @xmath108 satisfying @xmath109 , the latter condition coming from @xmath22 . in such a case @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    "assumes a fixed value for selected series of system sizes .",
    "for instance , for @xmath112 , @xmath99 or @xmath113 , and for @xmath114 , @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "each of the series @xmath117 and @xmath114 gives a smooth curve describing @xmath118 .",
    "similar argument applies to other series of the form @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , for some rational values of @xmath120 , the gap , as a function of the system size , follows a finite number of different curves . for irrational @xmath120 this argument does not apply and the gap behaves less regularly .",
    "secondly , the _ envelope _ of the gap as a function of the system size is proportional to its inverse .",
    "this is apparent when looking at the asymptotic expression in eq .  , and we show it as well in fig .",
    "[ ndelta ] by plotting @xmath121 as a function of @xmath10 for @xmath122 .     and @xmath123 .",

    "one can easily construct the series of the system sizes which exhibits such a behavior by sticking to @xmath10 s for which the oscillating term in eq .",
    "is of the order of one .",
    "this would be a _",
    "typical _ behavior as well .",
    "note however , that we may be able to choose such a series of system sizes that the gap closes very rapidly .",
    "the reason is that the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ kekka1 ] ) and ( [ kekka2 ] ) oscillate between positive and negative values as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : initial ] and in the asymptotic formula in eq .  .",
    "this implies that the gap is crossing zero if @xmath10 is allowed to take continuous values .",
    "then , it may be possible to choose appropriate values of @xmath10 close to those zeros which give very small , possibly exponentially small , values of the gap . if this is correct , which we failed to prove rigorously ( unlike the case of the infinite - range quantum @xmath0 model @xcite ) , the rate of the gap closing could be tuned to behave exponentially by an appropriate choice of the series of system size , or be outright zero for some specific system size and magnetic field @xmath3 .",
