    "the recent observation of a near - threshold narrow enhancement in the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum from radiative decay @xmath9 by the bes collaboration @xcite has renewed interest in the @xmath10 interaction and its possible baryonium bound states .",
    "in fact the enhancement in the @xmath8 invariant mass distribution near the threshold has been observed by the belle collaboration in the decays @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite . besides",
    ", the belle collaboration also observed a near - threshold enhancement in the @xmath0 invariant - mass spectrum in @xmath13 decays  @xcite .",
    "then , the same enhancement near the @xmath0 mass threshold was observed in the combined @xmath0 and @xmath14 invariant - mass spectrum from @xmath15 decays by bes collaboration and it can be fitted with an @xmath5-wave breit - wigner resonance with a mass @xmath16 mev and a width of @xmath17 mev or with a @xmath18-wave breit - wigner resonance  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no significant signal in @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , of special interest to search for possible resonant structures in other baryon - antibaryon states . in ref.@xcite , fermi - yang - sakata - like",
    "scheme was used to classify the possible baryon - antibaryon su(3 ) nonets .",
    "a systematic search of baryon - antibaryon states in color - magnetic interaction model was also performed and several interesting states were proposed  @xcite .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is widely accepted as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , so it is naturally to expect to understand hadron - hadron interaction from qcd . however , the direct use of qcd on the hadron - hadron interaction is too difficult because of the non - perturbative complications of qcd in the low energy region .",
    "recently , lattice qcd , dyson - schwinger approach and other non - perturbative methods have made impressive progresses  @xcite , but it is still far from satisfactory .",
    "qcd - inspired quark models are the main tool for detailed studies of the hadron - hadron interaction and multiquark systems at the moment .",
    "the commonly used quark model is the constituent quark model , where the complicated interactions between current quarks are approximately transformed into dynamic properties of quasi - particles ( constituent quarks ) and the residual interactions between these quasi - particles .",
    "the multi - gluon effect and other nonperturbative properties of qcd are attributed to the phenomenological confinement potential between constituent quarks .",
    "the residue interactions include effective one gluon exchange and one - goldstone - boson exchange  @xcite .",
    "the constituent quark model gives a good description of properties of hadrons : meson ( @xmath20 ) and baryon ( @xmath21 ) , because of their unique color structures .",
    "applying to nucleon - nucleon scattering , a reasonable agreement with experimental data is still possible after including the @xmath22-meson exchange for the chiral quark model ( chqm )  @xcite , although there is a controversy about its effect when taking @xmath22 meson as a @xmath23 @xmath3-wave resonance  @xcite .",
    "another constituent quark model approach is the quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm ) @xcite , which has been developed with the aim of understanding the well - known similarities between nuclear and molecular forces despite the obvious energy and length scale differences . in this model ,",
    "two ingredients : quarks delocalization and color screening are introduced to enlarge the hilbert space and to change the interaction between quarks resident in different baryons and the delocalization parameter that appears is determined by the dynamics of the interacting quark system .",
    "thus the quark system can reach its more favorable configuration through its own dynamics .",
    "the main difference between the chqm and the qdcsm is the mechanism of intermediate - range attraction .",
    "the recent calculations showed that both models can give a good description of the low - energy nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon scattering  @xcite , although they gave a little different dibaryon resonance structures  @xcite . for @xmath10 interaction ,",
    "almost the same results are also obtained in both models  @xcite , and there is no bound states as indicated by a strong enhancement at threshold of @xmath8 in @xmath24 and @xmath25 radiative decay .",
    "therefore , extending the calculations to @xmath0 study is an interesting practice .    in this paper",
    ", we study the @xmath0 system by using both chqm and qdcsm .",
    "it is quite meaningful to investigate the difference of these two models in baryon - antibaryon interaction .",
    "a brief description of these two quark models of the baryon - antibaryon interaction is given in section 2 .",
    "the calculated results and discussions are given in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains a brief summery .",
    ".parameters of the two quark models used .",
    "the masses of @xmath40 take their experimental values , @xmath41 @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath42 , @xmath44 @xmath42 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 5.5 in    = 5.5 in    the single channel ( sc ) calculations of @xmath4 states show that @xmath4 states are bound states if the annihilation interactions are not included in both models .",
    "the state with spin 0 is more bound than the one with spin 1 , even it is still bound with the inclusion of the annihilation interactions in qdcsm . after including the annihilation interactions , the state with spin 1 becomes unbound in both models , the state with spin 0 is also unbound in chqm , while it is still bound state in qdcsm .",
    "when the state @xmath4 couples to the open channel @xmath0 , the bound state will change into an elastic resonance in the @xmath45 scattering .",
    "the @xmath3-wave phase shifts of @xmath46 are calculated , and the effect of channel - coupling with @xmath4 are taken into account .",
    "the @xmath5-wave phase shifts of @xmath46 are illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . from the fig .",
    "2 , we can see that the phase shifts of @xmath0 rise though @xmath47 at resonance masses , which listed in tables ii and iii , for @xmath1 ( set i and ii ) and @xmath2 ( set i ) in qdcsm .",
    "the resonance masses are a little larger or smaller than the energies obtained from single - channel calculations .",
    "generally , if there is a bound state of @xmath0 , then the resonance mass of @xmath4 will be pushed up comparing with its stand alone mass , otherwise the resonance mass will be pulled down . from the table",
    "ii , the resonance mass for set i is pushed up , so it may infer that there is a bound state of @xmath0 . however ,",
    "from the single - channel and channel coupling calculations , we do not find a bound state for @xmath0 .",
    "maybe there is a zero - energy resonance of @xmath0 .",
    "further study is needed . comparing the results with set i and ii",
    ", it is clear that the annihilation interactions play an non - negligible role in the baryon - antibaryon systems .",
    "the inclusion of annihilation interactions pushes the state @xmath4 with spin 0 up about 40 mev and pushes the state @xmath4 state with spin 1 above the threshold .",
    "so from our calculation , there is a @xmath48 resonance state with resonance mass @xmath49 mev and decay width @xmath50 mev in qdcsm in the @xmath51 scattering phase shifts .",
    "the small width comes from the fact that only @xmath52-exchange contributes and the effect of @xmath52-exchange is greatly reduced due to no exchange term between particle and antiparticle . for example , for nucleon - hyperon system , the @xmath53 transition potential at separation 0.5 fm is about 1800 mev , the direct term contributes 90 mev only .",
    "3 shows the transition potential for @xmath54 .",
    "clearly , the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath4 is larger if the annihilation interactions are not taken into account .",
    "including the annihilation interactions , the transition potential will be reduced .",
    "so the decay width in the case i is larger .",
    "however the repulsive nature of the annihilation interaction will push the energies of @xmath4 high in the case ii , so the energy of @xmath4 is higher in the case of ii than that in case i. therefore we have a paradox : the state with larger binding energy has a larger decay width .",
    "in fact , these are two different calculations , where different interactions are used .",
    "no @xmath4 resonance will appear in @xmath55 scattering phase shifts .",
    "however , in the chqm , no resonance can be found if the annihilation interactions are included .",
    "in summary , we perform a dynamical study of @xmath0 systems with @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the framework of the chqm and the qdcsm by solving the rgm equation .",
    "all the model parameters are taken from our previous work , which gave a good description of the proton - antiproton @xmath3-wave elastic scattering cross section experimental data .",
    "the numerical results show that the @xmath0 systems with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are bound states in these two quark models if the annihilation interaction is neglected . when the annihilation interaction is considered , the @xmath0 systems become unbound . at the same time , the @xmath0 elastic scattering processes with coupling to @xmath4 state are also investigated . the calculated phase shifts are qualitatively similar in these two quark models .",
    "the results show that , there is no @xmath3-wave bound state of @xmath0 as indicated by an enhancement near the threshold of @xmath0 in @xmath6 .",
    "however , it is worthy of notice that qdcsm gives a @xmath7 @xmath4 resonance state , and the state become unbound in chqm if a single effective scalar exchange is used in the strange system to replace the @xmath22 meson used in the study of @xmath8 .",
    "it is generally believed that to describe the nucleon - nucleon interaction , the effect of one - gluon - exchange in quark model can be mimiced by the vector - meson exchanges in one - boson exchange model  @xcite . however , for nucleon - antihyperon conversion process , @xmath56 , one - gluon - exchange gives null contribution , while @xmath57-meson has nonzero contribution .",
    "so this conversion process is a good place to test the two mechanisms of baryon - antibaryon interaction in the short - range part .",
    "obviously our conclusion is based on the assumption that both chqm and qdcsm , which gave a good description of the proton - antiproton @xmath3-wave elastic scattering cross section experimental data , are suitable for @xmath0 system .",
    "in addition we assume that the @xmath0 system is in a @xmath58 configuration .",
    "more elaborating study of @xmath0 system is worth doing in the future .",
