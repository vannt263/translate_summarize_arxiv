    "due to long coherence time of some specific hyperfine states , high controllability of operations and high efficiency of state detection , the trapped atomic ion system has been considered as a promising candidate for quantum information processing . in particular , since they could be nearly perfectly prepared in some entangled states , the trapped ions have attracted considerable attention for high - precision quantum metrology  @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the measurement precision can be enhanced from the standard quantum limit ( sql ) or shot noise limit to the heisenberg limit by utilizing multipartite entanglement  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has demonstrated that the measurement precision may reach the heisenberg limit by using a noon state @xmath0 , which is a superposition of n particles in mode @xmath1 with zero particle in mode @xmath2 and vice versa .",
    "however , most of the relevant proposals on high - precision interferometry of trapped ions are subject to limited numbers of ions or to the requirement for individual addressing of ions , which restricts the scalability of those interferometry schemes .    in this article , we consider a mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometry using large numbers of entangled trapped ions .",
    "the mz interferometry consists of a beam splitter for splitting the incoming state and another beam splitter for state recombination .",
    "it has been shown that the adiabatic mz interferometry is an optimal candidate for high - precision measurement  @xcite .",
    "to achieve such an interferometry with trapped ions , we have to realize a nonlinear giant - spin hamiltonian with anisotropic interaction .",
    "the key point is how to generate the nonlinear interactions and then achieve the beam splitting and recombination . by applying a pair of lasers to manipulate independently their center - of - mass ( com ) modes ( either transverse or longitudinal vibrational modes ) ,",
    "the nonlinear giant - spin hamiltonian with anisotropic interaction could be simulated bases upon an array of trapped ions in a linear trap . by adjusting the coupling strength ( i.e. the rabi frequency ) between the two involved hyperfine states ,",
    "the mz interferometry could be carried out adiabatically . with current techniques for manipulating trapped ions",
    ", we discuss the experimental feasibility of our scheme and the difficulty due to decoherence in realistic experimental environment .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the physical system and derive its effective hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "iii , we show how to realize the mz interferometer by using quantum adiabatic processes through dynamical bifurcations .",
    "then , we discuss the experimental feasibility in sec .",
    "iv and analyze the undesired uncertainty due to decoherence in sec .",
    "v. in the last section , we briefly summarize our results .",
    "we consider n identical ions confined in a linear trap , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the three ionic states under our consideration are denoted by two hyperfine ground spin states ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and an excited state @xmath5 , respectively . in our scheme , all the ions are irradiated simultaneously by two traveling - wave laser beams with different frequencies , which coherently couple the hyperfine ground states through the optically stimulated raman transitions by adiabatically eliminating the excited state @xmath6 . here",
    "we assume the detuning of the optical fields from the electronic resonance to be much larger than the excited state linewidth and the corresponding coupling strength .",
    "as indicated in fig .",
    "1(a ) , under an usual rotating wave approximation to the laser frequencies , the interaction hamiltonian between the fields and the ions is written as ( @xmath7 )  @xcite @xmath8,\\]]where @xmath9 is the population inversion operator for the @xmath10-th ion , @xmath11 @xmath12 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the center - of - mass ( com ) mode and @xmath13 is the uniform effective rabi frequency .",
    "@xmath14 is the vibrational frequency of the com mode and @xmath15 is the detuning from the vibrational frequency .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath17 with the ion mass @xmath18 and the laser wavevector difference @xmath19 .    by tuning frequency differences and radiation directions of the pair of lasers along with independent manipulation of transverse or longitudinal com modes ,",
    "we may obtain following effective hamiltonian under some approximations and canonical transformations , @xmath20 where the collective angular momentum for all the ions are defined as @xmath21 with @xmath22 , the longitudinal field @xmath23 is the internal energy gap between the two spin states ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , and the transverse field @xmath26 corresponds to the effective rabi frequency , and the effective spin - spin nonlinear interaction is given as @xmath27 .",
    "more details of our derivation are given in appendix a. these parameters @xmath23 , @xmath26 , and @xmath28 could be controlled by rabi frequencies , wavevector differences of the lasers and the detunings .",
    "the mz interferometry consists of a beam splitter for splitting input states and another beam splitter for recombining output states .",
    "based upon the trapped - ion system ( 2 ) , the two beam splitters for a mz interferometry could be achieved by adiabatic quantum evolution through dynamical bifurcations .    in the collective spin representation ,",
    "the trapped - ion system is regarded as an ensemble of @xmath29 spin-@xmath30 particles .",
    "let @xmath31 stand for the joint eigenstate of the su(2 ) casimir operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which satisfy the relations @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36  dicke .",
    "@xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) means all ions in the hyperfine state @xmath24 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath40 . in the strong coupling limit @xmath41 , the ground state @xmath42 and the first excited state @xmath43 for the hamiltonian @xmath44",
    "are non - degenerated , where @xmath45 is a spin coherent state , and @xmath46 is a superposition of different states @xmath47 . when we adiabatically tune @xmath26 from the strong coupling limit ( @xmath48 ) to the weak coupling limit ( @xmath49 ) , the ground state @xmath42 and the first excited state @xmath43 evolve into the states @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath52 , the two lowest states turn to be degenerated .",
    "so in such an adiabatic passage , there exists a transition from non - degeneracy to degeneracy between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which can be regarded as a bifurcation  lee2004,ex - bifurcation , as shown in ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "2 . similar to a single - particle mz interferometry , where the ground state @xmath42 and the first exited state @xmath43 are utilized as two paths , the two states of maximum spin @xmath55 and @xmath56 can also be used as two paths for an n - particle mz interferometry .",
    "therefore , the achievement of the maximally path - entangled state @xmath57 implies accomplishment of the beam splitting .",
    "then we turn off the lasers for a duration @xmath58 so that the maximally path - entangled state @xmath59 evolves into @xmath60where @xmath61 is the frequency difference between the two hyperfine spin states @xmath3 and @xmath62 .",
    "there are two different methods for extracting the relative phase information between the two paths of the n - particle mz interferometry . in the case of few trapped ions , this",
    "could be carried out using controlled - not gates @xmath63 with the first ion being the control qubit and the rest ions being the target ones , followed by a hadamard operation ( @xmath64 ) on the first ion  @xcite .",
    "the relative phase information can be obtained by measuring the population of the first ion in the state @xmath65 or @xmath39 .",
    "taking @xmath66 as an example , this individually addressing method can be summarized briefly as follows , @xmath67    however , for systems of large numbers of ions , individual addressing becomes challenging and it becomes very difficult to extract the relative phase with the controlled - not gate @xmath63 .",
    "if we apply the inverse process of the first beam splitter for recombing the two paths , the relatives phase information indeed could be transferred into the population information of the two lowest states for the limit of @xmath68 . however , it is not easy to directly distinguish these two lowest states .",
    "fortunately , the two lowest states for symmetric ( @xmath40 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath69 ) systems of @xmath70 are almost identical and the two lowest states ( @xmath50 , @xmath71 ) become non - degenerate for an asymmetric system ( @xmath72 ) , see fig .",
    "2 ( c ) and ( d ) . therefore , to extract the relative phase , after applying the inverse process of the beam splitting process , we suddenly apply a proper nonzero @xmath73 ( @xmath72 ) and then adiabatically decrease @xmath26 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 . this recombination procedure for extracting the relative phase with two adiabatic processes could be summarized as ,    @xmath76    obviously , by measuring the population with all the ions in the state @xmath3 or @xmath62 , the relative phase between the two paths could be obtained .",
    "our scheme is feasible with current ion trap technology .",
    "if we employ a line of trapped @xmath77ca@xmath78 , the states @xmath3 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are denoted by s@xmath81 , s@xmath82 , and p@xmath83  @xcite . to adiabatically eliminate the ionic excited state @xmath80",
    ", the detuning of the optical fields from electronic resonance should be much larger than the excited state linewidth and the corresponding coupling strength , e.g. @xmath84 ghz .",
    "on the other hand , generation of the nonlinear term @xmath85 in the hamiltonian ( 2 ) requires that the detuning @xmath15 should be much smaller than the frequency @xmath14 of the longitudinal com mode . as a result , in our case we may take @xmath86mhz and @xmath87 . besides",
    ", the coherence time of the motional states has reached 100 ms @xcite . to change the effective coupling @xmath88 adiabatically ,",
    "we may set @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are nonnegative parameters , for example , @xmath92 khz and @xmath93 khz / ms with @xmath94 @xmath95 in the case of @xmath96 . consider the system in a free evolution by @xmath97 ms .",
    "after a duration for about 35 ms including three adiabatic processes plus the free evolution , we could obtain the relative phase by measuring the population of all the ions in state @xmath37 or @xmath98 .",
    "higher measurement precision for the trapped - ion mz interferometer requires more ions involved . with more ions involved , however , besides",
    "more attentions should be paid to larger coupling strength , we also need to consider the detrimental influence from decoherence . fortunately , currently available technologies enable the effective coupling strength to be on the order of mhz , which meets the requirement of our proposal .",
    "therefore , we focus below on the influence from decoherence .",
    "there are several sources of decoherence . here , as an example , we only consider the depasing decoherence influence on the estimation of the ionic zeeman splitting @xmath61 .",
    "the maximally entangled state of @xmath29 trapped ions undertaking mz interferometry decreases the measurement uncertainty of @xmath99 by @xmath100 times compared to the trapped ions in product states  @xcite .",
    "if decoherence due to environment is involved , the measurement precision would be seriously affected  estimation1,estimation2 because entangled states are more sensitive to decoherence than product states .",
    "a recent experiment  @xcite has reported that the noon state with 8 to 14 trapped ions subjects to correlated dephasing noise mostly because of magnetic field fluctuation and shows super - decoherence , where the coherence decays quadratically with the number of qubits .",
    "this correlated dephasing could be modeled by the lindblad equation in the free evolution , @xmath101+\\gamma ( 2j_{z}\\rho j_{z}-j_{z}^{2}\\rho -\\rho j_{z}^{2})\\]]where @xmath102 is the correlated dephasing rate , which is @xmath103 with @xmath104 the dephasing rate of a single qubit . here ,",
    "we consider @xmath105 @xmath106 to be the effective two - level dephasing rate  @xcite due to the two - photon raman process , where @xmath107 is the spontaneous decay rate of the excited state @xmath80 for a single qubit .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath108 shown in fig .",
    "3 is calculated in the equivalent spin representation , where the details are given in appendix b.    repeating the implementation of our proposal by one hundred times , we find that the correlated dephasing seriously spoils the measurement precision of the entangled state , yielding the precision even lower than the sql . by setting @xmath109 mhz , @xmath110 khz , and @xmath111 ghz , and considering free evolution by @xmath97 ms in each implementation , we have @xmath112 and the uncertainty of @xmath113 in the case of three - ion entanglement is larger than the sql , see fig .",
    "3 . in order to enhance the precision",
    ", we have to reduce @xmath114 .",
    "a possible way is to enlarge @xmath115 by ten times , which leads to @xmath116 to be about 0.001 , and thereby the measurement precision would approach the heisenberg limit",
    ". further improvement could be made by using refocusing pulses during the adiabatic operations to suppress the decay from @xmath117 .",
    "in summary , we have shown how to adiabatically carry out a mz interferometer based upon multiple trapped ions with artificial nonlinear interactions . influence from decoherence has also been discussed in our treatment . since our interferometry proposal involves large numbers of trapped ions and works by global operations , we argue that the proposal would be useful for high - precision quantum metrology with trapped ions toward the heisenberg limit  @xcite .",
    "we should also emphasize that , although our discussion above has only focused on the case of @xmath118 0 and @xmath119 0 for a trapped - ion mz interferometer , our model enables to study spin squeezing in an ion trap by setting @xmath120 0 for @xmath121 0 , which could be done by changing the directions of the laser beams @xmath122  and @xmath123 to make @xmath124  @xcite .",

    "1(a ) , irradiating the ions to the longitudinal com mode by applying two non - copropagating laser beams with the wavevector difference @xmath125 along the @xmath126-axis , we have the hamiltonian below in the rotating frame regarding @xmath127 under the rotating - wave approximation , @xmath128 then applying a canonical transformation @xmath129 with @xmath130  @xcite , we obtain @xmath131    cooling the com motion of the ions to its ground states , we obtain an effective spin - spin interaction in the hamiltonian , @xmath132 with @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the generation of the transverse - field term @xmath135 requires additional lasers . as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we set @xmath136 , implying a resonant raman process with respect to the two ground spin states of the ions .",
