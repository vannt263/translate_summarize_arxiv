    "an optical source associated with gamma - ray burst ( grb ) 970508 has recently been detected ( bond 1997 ) .",
    "absorption features seen in a spectrum from the keck 10 m telescope indicate that it is at or beyond @xmath6 and the lack of a prominent lyman-@xmath7 absorption suggests @xmath8 ( metzger et al .  1997 ) . presuming that the source is indeed the optical afterglow of the burst ,",
    "then grbs have only just been confirmed to be cosmological . as no emission lines have been detected from the transient and it is unclear whether the burst is at the redshift of the absorption system at @xmath6 ( see  2 ) , an alternative way to get a limit on the redshift is by looking for a lyman-@xmath7 forest or lyman limit absorption .",
    "lyman limit absorption arises from neutral hydrogen ( hi ) which is optically thick to lyman - continuum radiation for wavelengths @xmath9   in the rest frame of the absorbing system . since both redshifted lyman-@xmath7 absorption ( 1216  ) and the lyman limit ( @xmath10  ) remain in the uv passband for @xmath11 , currently only the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) can detect a lyman limit .",
    "as expected from theoretical models , both optical transients detected thus far have started fading soon after discovery , and thus a stis spectrum must be obtained as soon as possible after the burst so as to maximise signal  to  noise ( s / n ) .",
    "the distance inferred from a lyman limit in the continuum would provide knowledge of the luminosities and energies involved in the explosion  two vital parameters for constraining grb models . in section 2",
    "we discuss the possibilities of the grb afterglow undergoing lyman limit absorption .",
    "then , in section 3 we discuss the instrumentation and calculate the integration time required to infer the redshift of a grb .",
    "lyman limit absorption systems , which are generally hi clouds opaque ( @xmath12 ) to the lyman  continuum , are believed to concentrate in the disk and halo of most galaxies .",
    "steidel ( 1993 ) has found that the density of lyman limit systems is high enough out to impact parameter of @xmath13 kpc in the galactic disk that continuum radiation passing through the plane of the disk will always be subjected to lyman limit absorption .",
    "thus , if grbs occur at offsets @xmath0 kpc from the centres of their host galaxy , it is expected that roughly 50 percent ( half in front of the disk , half behind the disk ) of grb afterglow will have a lyman limit break in the spectrum ; this lyman limit will correspond to the precise redshift of the burst since the limit system will be local to the grb .",
    "intervening galaxies , not associated with the grb but in the line  of  sight of the afterglow , may also absorb the continuum ; thus a redshift inferred from a lyman limit will not necessarily be the redshift of the grb .",
    "what effect will this have on the determination of grb redshifts ?",
    "storrie - lombardi et al .  (",
    "1994 ) survey qso absorption spectra and find that for any random line  of  sight , the density of intervening lyman limit systems is @xmath14 for redshifts @xmath15 .",
    "thus at redshifts @xmath16 it is expected that most grb afterglows will be subjected to at least one lyman limit in their continuum that does not necessarily correspond to the intrinsic redshift of the grb .    if grbs are ejected to distances comparable to the scale length of the lyman limit absorption systems in the disk , then the probability that the host galaxy will absorb the spectrum shortward of the lyman limit is reduced .",
    "the top portion of figure ( [ fig : lls ] ) shows the expected probability of the existence of a lyman limit ( @xmath17 ) in the spectrum of a grb afterglow as a function of redshift and the offset scale length of grbs from their host galaxy .",
    "the relationship between the frequency of absorption from the host galaxy and the offset scale is computed by assuming that absorption only occurs if the grb is seen through the 40 kpc absorbing disk and that the disk has random viewing inclination . as seen",
    ", the frequency of lyman limit absorption in the spectrum of grbs at low redshifts ( @xmath18 ) may be used to determine the intrinsic offset of grbs from their host galaxies since most lyman limit absorption at low redshifts is expected to come the host galaxy .",
    "the bottom half of figure ( [ fig : lls ] ) shows , as a function of offset scale and redshift , the probability that the inferred redshift is within 20 percent of the redshift of the grb afterglow .",
    "if grbs occur with about 60 kpc of their host galaxy ( solid line ) , then more than 60 percent of the redshifts inferred from the lyman limit in the spectrum will be a moderately accurate ( @xmath19 percent ) measure of the redshift of the grb .",
    "absorption from mg ii , with a galactic impact parameter of @xmath20 kpc ( bergeron et al .",
    "1994 ) , and c iv is expected , but not required , to accompany a lyman limit system ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "thus , figure ( [ fig : lls ] ) could also be seen as a prediction of the frequency of absorption lines in grb afterglows .",
    "indeed for grb 970508 , both mg ii and fe ii absorption was detected using keck ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) ; arav & hogg ( 1997 ) have found that the absence of detectable c iv in the spectrum of the afterglow limits the redshift of the grb to @xmath21 ( 95 percent confidence ) .",
    "the stis ccd instrument onboard hst with a g230 lb low ",
    "resolution grating gives complete spectral coverage over the wavelength range 16853065  .",
    "this would be sufficient to detect the lyman limit over the redshift range ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the preferred instrument for obtaining redshifts from uv spectra , however , are the near uv ( nuv ) and far uv ( fuv ) multi - anode microchannel array ( mama ) detectors which is more sensitive and has much wider spectral range ( fuv : 11501736  ; nuv : 15703180  ) corresponding to a broad redshift range ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ) .",
    "temporal fits to the broadband spectra of the optical transients grb 970228 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ) and grb 970508 ( bond 1997 ) indicate that the grb afterglow may follow a power - law both in flux and spectral shape in optical wavelengths . it should be noted that the later transient had an observed rising phase of optical emission ( e.g.  galama et al .",
    "although individual cases may vary , in calculating the expected signal as a function of wavelength and time , we adopt the functional form of the flux as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 properly normalises the spectrum at @xmath27 , the time at which the decay begins .",
    "wijers , rees , & mszros ( 1997 ) find that the afterglow adequately fits the early light curve with @xmath28 and @xmath29 for grb 970228 .",
    "our preliminary fits to the data from grb 970508 indicate that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the afterglow is observed as a target of opportunity @xmath32 weeks after the burst ( e.g.  @xmath33 for grb 970508 ) , a redshift could be obtained in less than 10 hst orbits ( see fig .  [ 2 ] ) using the either fuv or nuv mama detectors .    unless _ hst _ is able to observe the afterglow of a grb while it is still bright ( @xmath34 ) , detection of damped lyman @xmath7 absorption at low redshift ( @xmath35 ) will require a very large integration time on stis .",
    "however , a significant detection of a lyman limit requires far less s / n per unit wavelength and thus improves the chance of determining a redshift of grbs from fewer orbits .",
    "although the lyman break occurs at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath36  ) than the lyman @xmath7 forest ( @xmath37 ) where the detectors are less sensitive , the distinct cut - off of this spectral feature is unambiguous and does not require good spectral resolution , making this the most effective and clearcut way to limit the redshift of faint sources .",
    "figure ( [ fig : int ] ) shows the expected integration time required to achieve a s / n=3 in a 100   bin as a function of @xmath38 magnitude of the afterglow and redshift of the lyman limit source for both the ccd and mama detector on stis . as seen in the figure ,",
    "if the afterglow is observed while it is still reasonably bright ( @xmath39 ) , detection of a redshift @xmath40 would require less than 1 hst orbit .",
    "figure ( [ fig : mama ] ) shows a simulated spectrum of an afterglow obtained with mama with @xmath41 hst orbits ( 5400 sec ) where the source is a magnitude @xmath42 and the spectral shape is @xmath43 ( eq .  1 ) .",
    "we have removed the contribution of the source to the observed spectrum for wavelengths @xmath44 corresponding to a lyman limit at a maximum redshift of @xmath45 .",
    "the clear break in the spectrum implies that a fairly accurate redshift is obtainable .",
    "in general , given the efficiency of stis and the spectral shape of the afterglow , the s / n increases with higher redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ [ fig : int ] ] ) for the nuv mama detector .",
    "if the burst occurs at a redshift @xmath16 then , with only a few orbits , one could determine the position of the lyman break well enough to determine its redshift to an accuracy of better than 5 percent ; it may even be possible to detect a lyman-@xmath7 forest at high @xmath46 with only a few orbits .",
    "as it is easier to detect a redshift for bursts that originate from a higher @xmath46 with the nuv mama detector , the absence of a lyman limit in the spectrum would , in general , always provide an upper limit to the redshift . from figure ( [ fig : int ] ) , it is clear that use of the mama detectors onboard the hst , given their very low internal countrates , are preferable to the ccd .",
    "the disadvantage of using hst to infer a redshift is the difficulty of altering its scheduled observations even on the timescale of weeks .",
    "certainly the advantage is that there are very few available ground - based telescopes that can resolve mg ii and c iv absorption lines from faint objects ; even then , such telescopes may not have the proper viewing conditions to the source and detected lines may place different limits in the redshift . in addition , there may be important emission ( e.g.  lines ) in the uv spectrum of grbs that would not be observable from the ground .    as the ensemble of optical counterparts begins to grow in size",
    ", it will be possible to infer both their redshift distribution and the distribution of grbs with respect to observable galaxies by noting the frequency of absorption lines and detected lyman limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lls ] ) .",
    "if no lyman limit is detected in the spectra of the optical transients ( especially at low - redshifts ) , the conclusion would be that either grbs do not originate near galaxies ( @xmath47 ) kpc or they are galactic in origin .",
    "a precise redshift of a gamma - ray burst would greatly further the field by providing an accurate understanding of the energies involved in the burst .",
    "assuming the extrapolation of the spectral index ( @xmath48 ) from the optical to uv passband is correct , we find that a mama detector observation of the bright afterglow of a grb by stis over @xmath49 orbit could reveal a lyman limit in the spectrum and hence , if the grb occurs behind a region of neutral hydrogen of its host galaxy , provide a direct redshift to a gamma - ray burst . given that lyman limit absorption may come from galaxies along the line  of  sight , we predict the expected frequency of lyman limits in the spectrum as a function of grb redshift and the distance from their host galaxy .",
