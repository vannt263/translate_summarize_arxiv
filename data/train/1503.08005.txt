    "we consider a time - homogeneous stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a lipschitz , @xmath3-valued function and where @xmath4 is an @xmath3-valued function that is allowed to have discontinuities .",
    "it is well - known that the problem of existence and uniqueness of a solution to is readily settled by picard iteration , if @xmath4 is lipschitz , too . in the case where the diffusion coefficient is bounded ,",
    "lipschitz , and ( partly ) uniformly elliptic , and the drift coefficient @xmath4 is only bounded and measurable , the pioneering work by @xcite and @xcite yields existence and uniqueness of the solution . there",
    "the result is achieved by applying a transform that removes the drift .",
    "this transform can in principle be computed by solving a non - degenerate elliptic partial differential equation . in the one - dimensional case",
    "this reduces to solving an ordinary differential equation .",
    "nevertheless , from the point of view of numerical treatment of this transformation method is impractical .    in @xcite one",
    "can find an existence and uniqueness result for multi - dimensional sdes , for the case where the drift is allowed to be discontinuous at a hyperplane , or at a hypersurface , but is well behaved everywhere else . instead of removing the whole drift by a transformation ,",
    "only the discontinuity is removed by using a different transformation method . for computing this",
    "transform one only needs to solve a parametrized family of odes which can be done by iterated integration .",
    "this transform is therefore much less costly from a computational point of view .",
    "+ in this paper , we prove another existence and uniqueness result for under conditions weaker than those in @xcite .",
    "the transform constructed here is explicit and thus gives rise to a numerical method that does not require solving any ( partial ) differential equation .",
    "+ in setups with non - globally lipschitz drift coefficient , various authors have studied convergence of numerical schemes .",
    "@xcite proves strong convergence of the euler - maruyama scheme for @xmath5 drift . @xcite",
    "present an explicit numerical method for which they are able to prove strong convergence in case of an sde with non - globally lipschitz coefficient .",
    "@xcite proves almost sure convergence of the euler - maruyama scheme in the case where the drift satisfies a monotonicity condition .",
    "@xcite show that the euler - maruyama scheme converges strongly in case of a discontinuous monotone drift coefficient , e.g. , in the case where the drift is a heaviside function .",

    "+ in contrast to that , we allow the drift to have a finite number of jumps , but require it to be lipschitz otherwise . the transformation method and the scheme based on it are the main contributions of this paper .",
    "the transformation itself is presented in a constructive way .",
    "moreover , it is chosen such that all the involved functions can be computed efficiently .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ex ] we introduce a transformation method different to those from @xcite and show that this also leads to an existence and uniqueness result .",

    "however , the form of the discontinuities is a special one : we allow only discontinuities in a finite number @xmath10 of distinct points @xmath11 and we assume that @xmath4 is lipschitz otherwise .",
