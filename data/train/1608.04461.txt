    "quantum mechanics has existed for about 100 years now , but despite its enormous success in experiment and application , the meaning and origin of its counterintuitive formalism is still widely considered to be difficult to grasp .",
    "many attempts to put quantum mechanics on a more intuitive footing have been made over the decades , which includes the development of a variety of interpretations of quantum physics ( such as the many - worlds interpretation  @xcite , bohmian mechanics  @xcite , qbism  @xcite , and many others  @xcite ) , and a thorough analysis of its departure from classical physics ( as in bell s theorem  @xcite or in careful definitions of notions of contextuality  @xcite ) . in more recent years",
    ", researchers , mostly coming from and inspired by the field of quantum information processing ( early examples include  @xcite ) , have taken as a starting point the set of all probabilistic theories .",
    "quantum theory is one of them and can be uniquely determined by specifying some of its characteristic properties  @xcite ( as in e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "while the origins of this framework date back at least to the 1960s  @xcite , it was the development of quantum information theory with its emphasis on simple operational setups that led to a new wave of interest in `` generalized probabilistic theories '' ( gpts )  @xcite .",
    "this framework turned out to be very fruitful for fundamental investigations of quantum theory s information - theoretic and operational properties .",
    "for example , gpts make it possible to contrast quantum information theory with other possible theories of information processing , and in this way to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristic properties in terms of computation or communication .    in a complementary approach",
    ", there has been a wave of attempts to find simple physical principles that single out quantum correlations from the set of all non - signalling correlations in the device - independent formalism  @xcite .",
    "these include non - trivial communication complexity  @xcite , macroscopic locality  @xcite , or information causality  @xcite .",
    "however , none of these principles so far turns out to yield the set of quantum correlations exactly .",
    "this led to the discovery of `` almost quantum correlations ''  @xcite which are more general than those allowed by quantum theory , but satisfy all the aforementioned principles .",
    "almost quantum correlations seem to appear naturally in the context of quantum gravity  @xcite .    a relation to other fields of physics",
    "can also be drawn from information causality , which can be understood as the requirement that a notion of entropy  @xcite exists which has some natural properties like the data - processing inequality  @xcite .",
    "these emergent connections to entropy and quantum gravity are particularly interesting since they point to an area of physics where modifications of quantum theory are well - motivated : jacobson s results  @xcite and holographic duality  @xcite relate thermodynamics , entanglement , and ( quantum ) gravity , and modifying quantum theory has been discussed as a means to overcome apparent paradoxes in black - hole physics  @xcite .    while generalized probabilistic theories provide a way to generalize quantum theory and to study more general correlations and physical theories , they still leave open the question as to which principles should guide us in applying the gpt formalism for this purpose .",
    "the considerations above suggest taking , as a guideline for such modifications , the principle that they support a well - behaved notion of thermodynamics . as a.",
    "einstein @xcite put it ,    _ `` a theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises , the more different kinds of things it relates , and the more extended its area of applicability .",
    "therefore the deep impression that classical thermodynamics made upon me .",
    "it is the only physical theory of universal content which i am convinced will never be overthrown , within the framework of applicability of its basic concepts . '' _    along similar lines , a.  eddington @xcite argued that _",
    "`` the law that entropy always increases holds , i think , the supreme position among the laws of nature .",
    "if someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with maxwell s equations  then so much the worse for maxwell s equations . if it is found to be contradicted by observation",
    " well , these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes .",
    "but if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics i can give you no hope ; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation . '' _",
    "here we take this point of view seriously .",
    "we investigate what kinds of probabilistic theories , including but not limited to quantum theory , could peacefully coexist with thermodynamics .",
    "we present two postulates that formalize important physical properties which can be expected to hold in any theory which is reasonably close to standard thermodynamics . on the one hand ,",
    "these two postulates allow for a class of theories more general than quantum or classical theory , which thus describes potential alternative physics consistent with important parts of thermodynamics as we know it . indeed , by considering a class of thought experiments originally conceived by von neumann ,",
    "we show that these theories all give rise to a unique , consistent form of thermodynamical entropy , which satisfies versions of the second law . on the other hand , we show that these postulates already imply many structural properties which are also present in quantum theory , for example self - duality and the existence of analogues of projective measurements , observables , eigenvalues and eigenspaces .    in summary",
    ", our analysis shows that important structural aspects of quantum and classical theory are already implied by these aspects of thermodynamics , but on the other hand it suggests that there is still some `` elbow room '' for modification within these limits dictated by thermodynamics .",
    "thermodynamics in gpts has been considered in some earlier works . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors introduced a notion of ( rnyi-2-)entanglement entropy , and studied the phenomenon of thermalization by entanglement  @xcite and the black - hole information problem ( in particular the page curve  @xcite ) in generalizations of quantum theory .",
    "hnggi and wehner  @xcite have related the uncertainty principle to the second law in the framework of gpts .",
    "chiribella and scandolo ( @xcite , see also  @xcite ) have considered the notion of diagonalization and majorization in general theories , leading to a resource - theoretic approach to thermodynamics in gpts .",
    "there are various connections between their results and ours , but there are essential differences . in particular , they assume the purification postulate ( which is arguably a strong assumption that in particular excludes classical thermodynamics ) , whereas we are not making any assumption on composition of systems whatsoever , and in this sense work in a more general framework . furthermore , while chiribella and scandolo take a resource - theoretic approach motivated by quantum information theory , our analysis relies on a more traditional thermodynamical thought experiment ( namely von neumann s ) .",
    "we presented results related to some of those in the present paper in the conference proceedings  @xcite ; here we use different assumptions and obtain additional results .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with an overview of the framework of generalized probabilistic theories",
    ". then we present von neumann s thought experiment on thermodynamic entropy , and a modification of it due to petz  @xcite .",
    "although it relies on very mild assumptions , it already rules out all theories that admit a state space known as the _ gbit _ or _ squit _ ( a square - shaped state space that can be used to describe one of the two local subsytems of a composite system known as the pr - box  @xcite , exhibiting stronger - than - quantum correlations ) .",
    "then we present our two postulates , and show that they imply many structural features of quantum theory .",
    "we show that theories that satisfy both postulates behave consistently in von neumann s thought experiment and admit a notion of thermodynamic entropy which satisfies versions of the second law .    because entropies are an important bridge between information theory and thermodynamics , in the final section we investigate the consequences of our postulates for generalizations of quantities of known significance in quantum thermodynamics  @xcite , defined by applying rnyi entropies to probabilities in convex decompositions of a state , or of measurements made on a state .",
    "in particular , we show a relation between max - entropy and sorkin s notion of higher - order interference  @xcite : equality of the preparation and measurement based max - entropies implies the absence of higher - order interference .",
    "most proofs are deferred to the appendix .",
    "several results of this paper have been announced in the master thesis of one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "our results are obtained in the framework of generalized probabilistic theories ( gpts )  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this framework is to capture all probabilistic theories , i.e.  all theories that use states to make predictions for probabilities of measurement outcomes .",
    "although the framework is based on very weak and natural assumptions , we can only provide a short introduction of the main notions and results here . for more detailed explanations of the framework ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the framework contains quantum theory and also the application of probability theory to classical physics , often referred to as classical probability theory , as special cases .",
    "it also contains theories which differ substantially from classical or quantum probability theory , for example boxworld  @xcite , which allows superstrong nonlocality , and theories that allow higher - order interference  @xcite .",
    "a central notion is that of the state and the set of states , the state space @xmath0 .",
    "a state contains all information necessary to calculate all probabilities for all outcomes of all possible measurements .",

    "the appropriate state to describe the resulting measurement statistics is @xmath27 .",

    "the following thought experiment has been applied by von neumann  @xcite to find a notion of thermodynamic entropy for quantum states @xmath62 .",
    "the result turns out to equal von neumann entropy , @xmath63 .",
    "we apply the thought experiment to a wider class of probabilistic theories .",
    "we adopt the physical picture used by von neumann  @xcite to describe the thought experiment ; we will comment on some idealizations used in this model at the end of this section .",
    "we consider a gpt ensemble @xmath64 $ ] , where @xmath65 denotes the @xmath43-th physical system , and @xmath66 of the systems are in state @xmath20 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this ensemble is described by the state @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , which describes the effective state of a system that is drawn uniformly at random from the ensemble .",
    "we introduce @xmath48 small , indistinguishable , hollow boxes  @xcite , and we put each ensemble system @xmath71 into one of the boxes such that the system is completely isolated from the outside .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the boxes form an ideal gas , which will allow us to use the ideal gas laws in the following derivation .",
    "this gas will be called the @xmath1-gas .",
    "we will denote the total thermodynamic entropy of a system by @xmath72 , with a subscript which may indicate whether it is the total entropy of a gas , which potentially depends both on the states of the gpt systems in the boxes and on the classical degrees of freedom ( positions , momenta ) of the boxes , or just the entropy of the gpt or of the classical degrees of freedom .",
    "at first we need to investigate how the entropy of the gas and of the ensemble are related to each other because later on , we will only consider the gas .",
    "so we consider also a second gpt ensemble @xmath73 $ ] ( described by @xmath74 ) implanted into a gas the same way . at temperature @xmath75 ,",
    "the movement of the boxes freezes out and we are left with the gpt ensembles . in this case , the thermodynamic entropies of the gases and the gpt ensembles must satisfy : @xmath76 .",
    "remember that the heat capacity is @xmath77 , and as the gases only differ in their internal systems , which are isolated , @xmath78 is the same for both gases . with @xmath79",
    "we thus find that @xmath80 is constant in @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 for all temperatures .",
    "the central tool for the thought experiment is a semi - permeable membrane .",
    "whenever a box reaches the membrane , the membrane opens that box and measures the internal system .",
    "depending on the result , a window is opened to let the box pass , or the window remains closed .",
    "it is crucial to note that this membrane will not cause problems in the style of maxwell s demon , as was already discussed by von neumann himself , because the membrane does not distinguish between its two sides .",
    "now we begin with the experiment itself ; see figure  [ fig : neumanntotal ] .",
    "we consider a state @xmath83 where @xmath20 are perfectly distinguishable pure states , and @xmath84 , where @xmath66 boxes contain a system in the state @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath1-gas is confined in a container of volume @xmath85 .",
    "let there be a second container which is identical to the first one , but empty .",
    "the containers are merged together , the wall of the non - empty container separating the containers replaced by a semi - permeable membrane which lets only @xmath23 pass . at the opposite wall of the non - empty container we insert a semi - permeable membrane which only blocks @xmath23 . the solid wall in the middle and the outer semi - permeable membrane are moved at constant distance until the solid wall hits the other end .",
    "once this is accomplished , i.e.  in stage 4 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : neumanntotal ] , one container has all @xmath23-boxes and the other one contains all the rest .",
    "note that this procedure is possible without performing any work as can be seen via dalton s law  @xcite : the work needed to push the semi - permeable membrane against the @xmath23-gas can be recollected at the other side from the moving solid wall , which is pushed by the @xmath23-gas into empty space .",
    "thus we have separated the @xmath23-boxes from the rest .",
    "we repeat a similar procedure until all the @xmath20-gases are separated into separate containers of volume @xmath85 .",
    "next we compress the containers isothermally to the volumes @xmath86 , respectively . denoting the pressure by @xmath87 , and using the ideal gas law , we obtain the required work @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the natural logarithm . as the temperature and",
    "thus the internal energy remain constant , we extract heat @xmath90 .    at this point , we have achieved that every container contains a pure state @xmath20 .",
    "we now transform every @xmath20 to another pure state @xmath91 which we choose to be the same for all containers .",
    "now we merge the containers , ending with a pure @xmath91-gas in the same condition as the initial @xmath1-gas .",
    "this merging is reversible , because the density is not changed and because all states are the same , so one can just put in the walls again .",
    "the only step that caused an entropy difference was the isothermal compression .",
    "thus , the difference of the entropies between the @xmath1-gas and and the @xmath91-gas ( which are equal to the entropies of the respective gpt ensembles ) is @xmath92 . therefore @xmath93 .",
    "if we assume that pure states have entropy zero , we thus end up with @xmath94 and with the following entropy per system of the ensemble : @xmath95 in summary , we have made the following assumptions to arrive at this notion of thermodynamic entropy :    [ assthoughtexp ]    * every ( mixed ) state can be prepared as an ensemble / statistical mixture of perfectly distinguishable pure states .",
    "* a measurement that perfectly distinguishes those pure states can be implemented as a semi - permeable membrane , which in particular does not disturb the pure states that it distinguishes . *",
    "all pure states can be reversibly transformed into each other .",
    "* thermodynamical entropy @xmath72 is continuous in the state .",
    "( since ensembles must have rational coefficients @xmath70 , we need this to approximate arbitrary states in the thought experiment . )",
    "* all pure states have entropy zero .",
    "a generalized version of the thought experiment presented by petz  @xcite is applicable to more general decompositions : suppose that @xmath96 are perfectly distinguishable , but not necessarily pure .",
    "let @xmath97 be a probability distribution .",
    "then petz thought experiment implies that @xmath98 the main idea is that steps 1)5 ) of von neumann s thought experiment can be run even if the perfectly distinguishable states @xmath45 are mixed and not pure ( as long as the membrane will still keep them undisturbed ) .",
    "then the entropy of the state in 5 ) can be computed by making an additional _ extensivity assumption _ :",
    "denote the gpt entropy of an @xmath1-ensemble of @xmath48 particles in a volume @xmath85 by @xmath99 , then this assumption is that @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "assuming in addition that the entropy of the @xmath40 containers adds up , petz arrives at  ( [ eqpetz ] ) . while this approach needs this additional extensivity assumption , it does not need to postulate that all pure states can be reversibly transformed into each other ( in contrast to von neumann s version ) . under the assumption that all pure states have entropy zero",
    ", it reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eqvonneumannentropy ] ) as a special case .",
    "we conclude this section with a few comments on the idealizations used in the thought experiments above .",
    "the use of gases in which the exact numbers of particles with each internal state is known parallels von neumann s argument in @xcite .",
    "we rarely if ever have such precise knowledge of particle numbers in real physical gases , so our argument involves a strong idealization , but one that is common in thermodynamics and that has also been made by von neumann .",
    "are among the relevant tools for tackling them . ]",
    "although fluctuations in work are significant for small particle numbers , in the thermodynamic limit of large numbers of particles there is concentration about the expected value given , in von neumann s protocol , by the von neumann entropy , and therefore our arguments ( and von neumann s ) have the most physical relevance in this large-@xmath48 situation .",
    "this is of course true for classical thermodynamics as well  indeed , the use made of the ideal gas law and dalton s law in von neumann s argument are additional places where large @xmath48 is needed if one wants fluctuations to be negligible .",
    "we expect finer - grained considerations to be required for a thorough study of fluctuations in finite systems , which is one reason for interest in the additional entropic measures studied in subsection  [ subsecentropies ] , but von neumann s argument does not concern these finer - grained aspects of the thermodynamics of finite systems .",
    "in section  [ secframework ] , we have introduced the `` gbit '' , a system for which the state space @xmath5 is a square .",
    "gbits are particularly interesting because they correspond to `` one half '' of a popescu - rohrlich box  @xcite which exhibits correlations that are stronger than those allowed by quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "one might wonder whether the thought experiments of section  [ secthoughtexp ] allow us to define a notion of thermodynamic entropy for the gbit .",
    "we will now show that this is not the case , which can be seen as a thermodynamical argument for why we do not see superstrong correlations of the popescu - rohrlich type in our universe .",
    "since not all states of a gbit can be written as a mixture of perfectly distinguishable _ pure _ states , von neumann s original thought experiment can not be of direct use here .",
    "however , we may resort to petz version : every mixed state @xmath1 of a gbit can be written as a mixture of perfectly distinguishable _ mixed _ states , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : gbitentropy ] .",
    "furthermore , the other crucial assumption on the state space is satisfied , too : for every pair of perfectly distinguishable mixed states , there is an instrument ( a `` membrane '' ) that distinguishes those states without disturbing them .",
    "we even have that all pure states can be reversibly transformed into each other ( namely by a rotation of the square ) .",
    "thus , we can analyze the behavior of a gbit state space in petz version of the thought experiment .",
    "any continuous notion of thermodynamic entropy @xmath72 consistent with this thought experiment would thus have to satisfy  ( [ eqpetz ] ) .",
    "however , we will now show that the gbit does not admit any notion of entropy that satisfies  ( [ eqpetz ] ) .",
    "consider different decompositions of the state @xmath102 in the center of the square , where @xmath103 as well as @xmath104 .",
    "it is geometrically clear that every choice of @xmath105 corresponds to a valid decomposition .",
    "we find ( applying eq .",
    "( [ eqpetz ] ) to @xmath1 for the first equality , and to @xmath106 and @xmath107 for the second ) : @xmath108 this expression can never be constant in @xmath109 , no matter what value of entropy of the four pure states @xmath110 we assume .",
    "thus , the entropy @xmath111 of the center state @xmath1 is not well - defined , since it depends on the choice of decomposition .        in other words ,",
    "the structure of the gbit state space enforces that any meaningful notion of thermodynamic entropy @xmath72 will not only be a function of the _ state _ , but a function of the _ ensemble that represents the state_. if a state @xmath1 is represented by different ensembles , then this will in general give different values of entropy .",
    "so what goes wrong for the gbit ? clearly , all we can say with certainty is that the combination of assumptions made in von neumann s thought experiment turns out not to yield a unique notion of entropy , while a deeper physical interpretation seems only possible under further assumptions on the interplay between the gbit and the thermodynamic operations .",
    "however , a comparison with quantum theory motivates at least one further speculative attempt at interpretation . in the example",
    "above , we have decomposed a state @xmath1 into two perfectly distinguishable states @xmath106 and @xmath107 , which can themselves be decomposed into pairs of perfectly distinguishable states @xmath23 and @xmath25 , or @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively . in quantum theory",
    ", this would only be possible if @xmath106 and @xmath107 are orthogonal , which would then imply that all four states @xmath18 are pairwise orthogonal .",
    "this would enforce that there exists a unique projective measurement ( a `` membrane '' ) that distinguishes all these four states jointly .",
    "in other words , there would be an experimental , thermodynamical context in which the four pure states ( whose mixture yields @xmath1 ) can be jointly accessed by a thermodynamical operation , yielding a unique notion of entropy by analyzing the entropy balance of that operation .",
    "on the other hand , in the gbit , the four pure states @xmath18 are _ not _ jointly perfectly distinguishable .",
    "hence there is no canonical choice of `` membrane '' that could be used in a thermodynamical setting to define a unique natural notion of entropy for the gbit states .",
    "entropy will be `` contextual '' , depending on the membrane resp .",
    "ensemble that is used in the specific thermodynamical setting .",
    "the observation that _",
    "`` pairwise distinguishability@xmath114joint distinguishability '' _ is thermodynamically relevant is closely related to the observation of `` dimension mismatch '' in  @xcite , and it suggests a possible relation between thermodynamics and the exclusivity principle which has recently been applied in studies of contextuality @xcite ( and which originated no later than specker s paper of 1960 @xcite ) .",
    "it is closely related to orthomodularity ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we introduce the two postulates that express key operational concepts from thermodynamics .",
    "the first postulate is motivated by the universality of thermodynamics and the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic behaviour . at",
    "first we consider the universality of thermodynamics , in the sense that thermodynamics is a very general theory whose basic principles can be applied to many possible implementations , as already noticed by n.  carnot @xcite :    _ `` in order to consider in the most general way the principle of the production of motion by heat , it must be considered independently of any mechanism or any particular agent .",
    "it is necessary to establish principles applicable not only to steam engines but to all imaginable heat - engines , whatever the working substance and whatever the method by which it is operated . '' _    in quantum theory this universal applicability is especially strongly evident in the fact that all orthonormal bases are equivalent : all orthonormal bases can be translated into each other by a unitary and therefore reversible map .",
    "transforming all operators ( including the hamiltonian ) by a unitary map yields a physically , and in particular thermodynamically , equivalent situation . in a classical framework ,",
    "this equivalence is even more trivial , because all ( pure ) states are distinguishable and transformations that change the description ( for example , canonical transformations ) while yielding equivalent results are standard exercises in analytical mechanics textbooks .",
    "this universality , i.e.  independence of the labels , choice of description and implementation should continue to hold in all generalized theories that we consider .",
    "an orthonormal basis from quantum theory is nothing else than a set of perfectly distinguishable pure states , i.e.  an @xmath40-frame . choosing a set of perfectly distinguishable pure states ( for example as energy eigenbasis or as system states to implement an ensemble )",
    "can be interpreted as one particular choice of implementation , but as stated by carnot , thermodynamics must be independent of the choice of implementation . to enable this independence , there should exist a reversible transformation that translates all states , observables etc .  from one set of perfectly distinguishable pure states to any other",
    "one : + * postulate 1 : * for each @xmath115 , all sets of @xmath40 perfectly distinguishable pure states are equivalent .",
    "that is , if @xmath116 and @xmath117 are two such sets , then there exists a reversible transformation @xmath81 with @xmath118 for all @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , postulate 1 expresses a physical property that is crucial for thermodynamics : that of _ microscopic reversibility_. many characteristic properties of thermodynamics arise from limited experimental access to the microscopic degrees of freedom , which by themselves undergo reversible time evolution .",
    "this reversibility , for example , forbids evolving two microstates into one , which is at the heart of the non - decrease of entropy .",
    "if the experimenter had full access to the microscopic degrees of freedom , then he or she could convert any state of maximal knowledge to any other one as long as he or she preserved distinguishability .",
    "postulate 1 formalizes this microscopic basis of thermodynamics by demanding the existence of `` enough '' distinguishability - preserving , microscopic transformations @xmath81 , which can be understood as reversible time evolutions .",
    "postulate 1 has substantial information - theoretical justifications and consequences .",
    "the basic concepts of both thermodynamics and information processing are independent of the choice of implementation . for information processing this",
    "is formalized by the turing machine which admits a multitude of physical realizations .",
    "perfectly distinguishable pure states can be taken as bits , and postulate 1 expresses that all bits ( or their higher - dimensional analogues ) are equivalent .",
    "it is for this reason that postulate 1 was called _",
    "generalized bit symmetry _ in  @xcite , and its restriction to pairs of distinguishable states was called _ bit symmetry _ in  @xcite . starting with landauer s principle , `` thermodynamics of computation ''  @xcite has become a fruitful paradigm that relates the two apparently disjoint fields .",
    "the two complementary interpretations of postulate 1 are one instance of this .",
    "now we turn to our second postulate .",
    "we are looking for theories very similar to the thermodynamics we are used to ; thus it is essential that we can adopt basic notions of standard thermodynamics unchanged or with only very small alterations .",
    "two such notions of great importance are ( shannon ) entropy @xmath119 and majorization theory . in classical and quantum thermodynamics ,",
    "these notions operate on the coefficients in a decomposition of a state into perfectly distinguishable pure states ( in quantum theory , the eigenvalues ) . in order to not change thermodynamic theory too much",
    ", we would also like this to be possible in our more general state spaces .",
    "thus , we demand that every state has a convex decomposition into perfectly distinguishable pure states .",
    "note that this was indeed one of our assumptions in von neumann s thought experiment in section  [ secthoughtexp ] .",
    "there , it allowed us to realize any state @xmath1 as a `` quasiclassical ensemble '' , i.e.  as an ensemble of states that behave like classical labels .",
    "this gives us a further justification of our second postulate : thermodynamic ( thought ) experiments require that states have an ensemble interpretation .",
    "an unambiguous notion of `` counting of microstates '' demands that the ensembles consist of perfectly distinguishable , pure states . without this , obtaining a phenomenological thermodynamics for which the theory is the underlying microscopic theory seems problematic .",
    "thus , our second postulate is + * postulate 2 * : every state @xmath120 has a convex decomposition @xmath121 into perfectly distinguishable pure states @xmath20 . + it is tempting to interpret the two postulates as reflecting the _ microscopic _ and the _ macroscopic _ aspects of thermodynamics , respectively : while postulate 1 describes microscopic reversibility of the pure states that may describe single particles in thermodynamics , postulate 2 ensures that mixed states can be interpreted macroscopically as descriptions of quasiclassical ensembles , composed of a large number of particles that are separately in unknown but distinguishable microstates",
    ".    we will not introduce any further postulates . in particular , we will not make any assumptions on the _ composition _ of systems .",
    "all our results are therefore independent from notions like _ tomographic locality",
    "_  @xcite ( which is arguably dispensable in many important situations  @xcite ) or _ purification _  @xcite ( which is a rather strong assumption ) ; we do not assume either of the two .",
    "postulates 1 and 2 have been analyzed in  @xcite , but in a different context : instead of investigating thermodynamics , the goal in  @xcite was to obtain a reconstruction of quantum theory , by supplementing postulates 1 and 2 with further postulates",
    ". some of the insights from  @xcite will be important here , and are therefore briefly discussed below . starting with subsection  [ subsecobservables ] , we will also obtain new results that are interesting in a thermodynamic context .",
    "in contrast to hilbert space , there is no apriori notion of inner product for gpts .",
    "however , as shown in  @xcite , we get a natural inner product @xmath122 as a consequence of postulates 1 and 2 : it satisfies @xmath123 for all reversible transformations @xmath81 , and @xmath124 for all states @xmath125 .",

    "postulates 1 and 2 , all these properties hold in complete analogy  @xcite .",

    "since we are dealing with unnormalized states , the corresponding analog in gpts will be formulated in terms of the set of unnormalized states @xmath61 .",
    "as one can see in the case of the gbit , it is not automatic that we have any notion of `` projective measurements '' for any given state space .",
    "however , postulates 1 and 2 turn out to ensure that projective measurements exist . for any face @xmath141 of @xmath61 ( the non - negative multiples of the corresponding face of @xmath0 ) , consider the orthogonal projector @xmath145 onto the span of @xmath141 .",
    "one can show that @xmath145 is _ positive _ , i.e.  maps ( unnormalized ) states to ( unnormalized ) states  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath145 does not disturb the states in the face @xmath141 .",
    "thus , to a given set of mutually orthogonal faces @xmath146 such that @xmath147 , we can associate an instrument with transformations @xmath148 , which describes a projective measurement , as in a semipermeable membrane .",

    "these transformations are @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the orthogonal hilbert space projector onto the @xmath43-th hilbert subspace .",
    "the rank condition becomes @xmath156 ( the total hilbert space dimension ) , and mutual orthogonality is @xmath157 .",
    "we will show in subsection [ subsecobservables ] that the mutually orthogonal faces replace the eigenspaces from quantum theory and that the projective measurement described here can be interpreted as measuring an observable .",
    "+ the hilbert space projector @xmath155 therefore also has an interpretation as an _ effect _ in standard quantum theory : it yields the probability of outcome @xmath43 in the projective measurement on a state @xmath62 , namely @xmath158 . the analogous effect in a gpt that satisfies postulates 1 and 2 , corresponding to a face @xmath141 , is @xmath159 ( identifying the effect @xmath160 with a vector via the inner product ) .",
    "the effect @xmath161 is sometimes called the `` projective unit '' of @xmath141 . in quantum theory , we can write @xmath162 , where the @xmath163 are an orthonormal basis of the corresponding hilbert subspace . the same turns out to be true in our gpts : we have @xmath164 where @xmath165 is any frame that generates @xmath141 . therefore , the probability to obtain outcome @xmath43 in the projective measurement above on state @xmath1 is @xmath166 .",
    "it is easy to see that both quantum and classical state spaces satisfy postulates 1 and 2 . by a `` classical state space '' ,",
    "we mean a state space that consists of discrete probability distributions . concretely , for any number @xmath167 of mutually exclusive alternatives , consider the state space @xmath168 any pure state is given by a deterministic probability vector , i.e.  @xmath169 ( where @xmath7 is on the @xmath43-th place ) .",
    "if we have two equally sized sets of such vectors ( as in postulate 1 ) , then there is always a permutation that maps one set to the other .",
    "in fact , the reversible transformations correspond to the permutations of the entries .",
    "postulate 2 is then simply the statement that @xmath170 which state spaces are there , in addition to standard complex quantum theory and classical probability theory , that satisfy postulates 1 and 2 ?",

    "the notion of higher - order interference has been introduced by sorkin  @xcite , and has since been the subject of intense theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite interest .    for the main idea , think of three mutually exclusive alternatives in quantum theory ( such as three slits in a triple - slit experiment ) , described by orthogonal projectors @xmath171 .",

    ". postulating this `` absence of third - order interference '' in addition to postulates 1 and 2 gives us the following :    [ lemlist ] the possible state spaces which satisfy postulates 1 and 2 _ and _ which do not admit third - order interference , in addition to classical state spaces , are the following .",

    "they are analogous to the standard bloch ball @xmath188 of quantum theory , with very similar descriptions of effects etc .",

    "a central part of physics are observables and how they can be measured . in standard quantum theory",
    ", we can introduce observables in two different ways , which both equivalently lead to the prescription that _ observables are described by hermitian operators / matrices_.    first , in finite dimensions , we can characterize observables as _ those objects that linearly assign real expectation values to states_. in the case of quantum theory it follows that observables are represented by matrices @xmath195 , and hermiticity @xmath134 implies that expectation values @xmath196 are always real .",

    "the _ order-@xmath299 r@xmath287nyi decomposition entropy _ is defined as @xmath302 where the infimum is over all convex decompositions of @xmath1 into _ pure _ states @xmath303 .",
    "the idea of measurement entropy is to characterize the state before a measurement .",
    "for example , in quantum theory , particles prepared in a state @xmath304 which all give the same result in energy measurements would be said to be in an energy eigenstate .",
    "if instead we performed a position measurement , the resulting distribution of positions would have non - zero entropy .",
    "however , this entropy would arguably not come from the initial state , but from the measurement process itself due to the uncertainty principle .",
    "suppose we would like to prepare a state @xmath1 by using states of maximal knowledge ( i.e.  pure states ) @xmath305 , and a random number generator which gives output @xmath57 with probability @xmath306 .",
    "then the decomposition entropy quantifies the smallest information content ( entropy ) of a random number generator that would be necessary to build such a device . for more detailed operational interpretations of measurement and decomposition entropy , in particular for @xmath307 ,",
    "see  @xcite note that in quantum theory , measurement , decomposition and spectral rnyi entropies all coincide , with the @xmath307 case giving von neumann entropy , @xmath308 .",
    "our first result is that the spectral and measurement definitions of the entropies agree :    [ therenyi ] consider any state space @xmath28 which satisfies postulates 1 and 2 .",
    "then the r@xmath287nyi entropies @xmath309 and the r@xmath287nyi measurement entropies @xmath310 coincide , and upper - bound the rnyi decomposition entropy @xmath311 , i.e. @xmath312.\\ ] ] in particular , for @xmath307 , the measurement entropy @xmath313 is the same as the spectral entropy @xmath242 from definition  [ defspectralentropy ] , which we have identified with thermodynamical entropy @xmath72 in observation  [ obsentropy ] .",
    "[ theorem : measistherm ]    the inequality @xmath314 is easy to see : for a decomposition @xmath315 into perfectly distinguishable pure states @xmath19 , the states @xmath19 can also be seen as a fine - grained measurement , yielding outcome probabilities @xmath316 .",
    "so taking the infimum over all decompositions gives _ at most _ @xmath317 .",
    "the equality between @xmath309 and @xmath310 is shown in the appendix .",
    "we do not know in general whether postulates 1 and 2 imply that @xmath318 for all @xmath299 .",
    "interestingly , we know it for @xmath319 and @xmath320 :    [ thm : h2 ] if a state space satisfies postulates 1 and 2 , then @xmath321 and @xmath322 for all states @xmath1 .    to give the reader an idea of the kind of arguments involved , we present the proof for @xmath323 , but defer the proof for @xmath324 to the appendix .",
    "if @xmath325 is any convex decomposition into a maximal set of perfectly distinguishable pure states ( without loss of generality @xmath326 ) , and @xmath327 any ( other ) convex decomposition into pure states @xmath305 ( also with @xmath328 , then @xmath329 since @xmath330 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath331 and since @xmath332 is defined as the infimum over the right - hand side , we obtain that @xmath333 ; we find the converse inequality in theorem  [ therenyi ] .",
    "we do not know whether the same identity holds for the most interesting case @xmath307 , the case of standard thermodynamic entropy @xmath334 . in the max - entropy case @xmath335 , however , we have a surprising relation to higher - order interference :    [ thmallequiv ] consider a state space satisfying postulates 1 and 2 .",
    "then the following statements are all equivalent :    * the state space does not have third - order interference . *",

    "the `` atomic covering property '' of quantum logic holds .",
    "the equivalences @xmath338 are shown in  @xcite ; our new result is the equivalence to ( ii ) , which is shown in the appendix .",
    "absence of third - order interference is meant in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eqnothirdorder ] ) , as introduced originally by sorkin  @xcite : only pairs of mutually exclusive alternatives can possibly interfere .",
    "it is interesting that this is related to an information - theoretic property of max - entropy @xmath339 , as given in ( ii ) .",
    "we do not currently know whether @xmath339 ( or , in particular , the identity of @xmath340 and @xmath339 ) has any thermodynamic relevance in the class of theories that we are considering , but it certainly does within quantum theory , where it attains operational meaning in single - shot thermodynamics  @xcite .    as ( iii ) shows , this theorem is closely related to open problem 1 : it gives properties of conceivable state spaces that satisfy postulates 1 and 2 , but are not on the list of known examples ( namely , they do not satisfy any of @xmath341 ) .",
    "similarly , ( iv ) shows the relation of higher - order interference to open problem 2 , and ( v ) relates all these items to quantum logic .",
    "in fact , one can show that postulates 1 and 2 imply that the set of faces of the state space has the structure of an _ orthomodular lattice _",
    ", which is often seen as the definition of quantum logic .",
    "for readers who are familiar with the terminology of quantum logic , we give some additional remarks in subsection  [ appendixquantumlogic ] in the appendix .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , many works ( dating back at least to the 1950s ) have considered quantum theory as just one particular example of a probabilistic theory : a single point in a large space of theories that contains classical probability theory , as well as many other possibilities that are non - quantum and non - classical .",
    "more recent works have focused on the information - theoretic properties of quantum theory , for example deriving quantum theory as the unique structure that satisfies a number of information - theoretic postulates .    rather than attempt a derivation of quantum theory from postulates ,",
    "this paper has examined the thermodynamic properties of quantum theory and of those theories that are similar enough to quantum theory to admit a good definition of thermodynamic entropy , and of some version of the second law .",
    "postulate 1 states that there is a reversible transformation between any two sets of @xmath40 distinguishable pure states .",
    "this can be thought of as an expression of the universality of the representation of information , in particular that a choice of basis is arbitrary , and also allows for reversible microscopic dynamics , as is crucial for thermodynamics . postulate 2 states that every state can be written as a convex mixture of perfectly distinguishable pure states .",
    "this ensures that a mixed state describing an ensemble of many particles can be treated as if each particle has an unknown microstate , drawn from a set of distinguishable possibilities .",
    "much follows from postulates 1 and 2 , without needing to assume any other aspects of the standard formalism of quantum theory . in order to derive thermodynamic conclusions , we considered the argument originally employed by von neumann in his derivation of the mathematical expression for the thermodynamic entropy of a quantum state .",
    "the argument involves a thought experiment with a gas of quantum particles in a box , and semi - permeable membranes that allow a particle to pass or not depending on the outcome of a quantum measurement . by applying the same thought experiment",
    ", we showed that given any theory satisfying postulates 1 and 2 , there is a unique expression for the the thermodynamic entropy , equal to both the spectral entropy and the measurement entropy . by way of contrast",
    ", a fictitious system defined by a square state space , which arises as alice s local system of an entangled pair producing stronger - than - quantum `` pr box '' correlations , does not satisfy either postulate .",
    "this system  the gbit  does not admit a sensible notion of thermodynamic entropy , at least not one that is given to it by the von neumann or petz arguments .",
    "while many works have discussed the inability of quantum theory to produce arbitrarily strong nonlocal correlations , this connection with thermodynamics deserves further investigation .",
    "it would be very interesting , for example , if tsirelson s bound on the strength of quantum nonlocal correlations could be derived from a thermodynamic argument .",
    "there are many other consequences of postulates 1 and 2 for both thermodynamic and information - theoretic entropies .",
    "for example , a form of the second law holds in that neither projective measurements nor mixing procedures can decrease the thermodynamic entropy .",
    "the spectral and measurement order-@xmath299 renyi entropies coincide for any @xmath299 .",
    "the spectral and decomposition order-@xmath299 renyi entropies coincide for @xmath342 or @xmath343 .",
    "an open question is whether any theory satisfying postulates 1 and 2 is completely satisfactory from the thermodynamic point of view .",
    "while the von neumann and petz arguments can be run with no trouble in the presence of postulates 1 and 2 as we have shown , there could still be a different physical scenario , in which theories would fail to exhibit sensible behaviour unless they have even more of the structure of quantum theory .",
    "finally , another major open question is whether quantum - like theories exist , satisfying postulates 1 and 2 , that are distinct from quantum theory in that they admit higher - order interference . roughly speaking",
    ", this means that three or more possibilities can interfere in order to produce an overall amplitude , unlike in quantum theory , where different possibilities only interfere in pairs .",
    "we extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that in the context of postulates 1 and 2 the existence of higher - order interference is equivalent to each of three other statements .",
    "we provide an equivalent entropic condition : there is higher - order interference if and only if the measurement and decomposition versions of the max entropy do not coincide .    our understanding of quantum theory would be greatly improved if higher - order interference could be ruled out by simple information - theoretic , thermodynamic , or other physical arguments . on the other hand ,",
    "if theories with higher - order interference exist and are eminently sensible , an immediate question is whether an experimental test could be performed to distinguish such a theory from quantum theory .",
    "while previous experiments  @xcite only tested for a zero versus non - zero value of higher - order interference , sensible higher - order theories that satisfy postulates 1 and 2 ( if they exist ) could help to inform future experiments by supplying concrete models that can be tested against standard quantum theory .",

    "let @xmath276 be the bistochastic matrix from lemma [ lemma : bistochastic ] with @xmath614 . by birkhoff s theorem , it is a convex combination of permutation matrices , i.e. @xmath615 for a probability distribution @xmath616 and permutation matrices @xmath617 .",
    "wlog we only consider the shannon entropy ; the proof for the rnyi entropies works exactly the same way . as the shannon entropy is schur - concave and invariant under permutations : @xmath618 furthermore @xmath619 is the entropy of a measurement that perfectly distinguishes the @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath571 . because of lemma [ lemma : perfectlydistinguishingandfinegrained ] , such a measurement can be chosen to be finegrained .",
    "therefore we find : @xmath620      as mentioned in the main text , the equivalences @xmath338 are shown in  @xcite .",
    "we will now prove the equivalence @xmath621 , which proves theorem  [ thmallequiv ] .",
    "taking into account theorem  [ therenyi ] , and formulating the atomic covering property in the context of theories that satisfy postulates 1 and 2 , it remains to show the equivalence of the following two statements :    * for all states @xmath34 , we have @xmath622 . * if @xmath141 is any face of @xmath61 , and @xmath1 is any pure state , then the smallest face @xmath623 that contains both @xmath141 and @xmath1 has rank @xmath624 .",

    "we will first prove that @xmath626 , which is equivalent to @xmath627 .",
    "so suppose that there exists some face @xmath141 of @xmath61 and a pure state @xmath1 such that the face @xmath623 generated by both has rank @xmath628 .",
    "let @xmath165 be a frame that generates the face @xmath141 .",
    "then @xmath141 is also generated by @xmath629 , i.e.  the normalized projective unit of @xmath141 .",
    "this is because every face containing @xmath630 also contains all the @xmath20 ( and vice versa ) , and @xmath141 is the smallest face with this property .",
    "now consider the state @xmath631 .",
    "the smallest face that contains this state must be @xmath623 .",
    "if this state had a decomposition into @xmath632 or fewer perfectly distinguishable pure states , then these would also generate @xmath623 , and so @xmath624 , in contradiction to our assumption .",
    "thus any decomposition of @xmath633 into perfectly distinguishable pure states uses at least @xmath634 states with non - zero coefficients , i.e.  @xmath635 . but @xmath636 is a convex decomposition into @xmath632 pure states , thus @xmath637 it remains to show that @xmath638 .",
    "so suppose that ( v ) holds , but that there is a state @xmath34 with @xmath639 ; we will show that this leads to a contradiction . by definition of @xmath340 , if this is the case , then there exist pure states @xmath45 with @xmath640 and @xmath641 , @xmath642 , such that @xmath643 . using property ( v ) , and recursively looking at the faces",
    "generated by @xmath23 , generated by @xmath644 , generated by @xmath645 and so forth , shows that the rank of the face @xmath623 generated by @xmath45 can be at most @xmath40 . since @xmath646",
