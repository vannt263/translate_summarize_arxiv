    "electron transport through quasi - one dimensional disordered systems is characterized by the scattering matrix @xmath0 , relating the amplitudes of incoming and outgoing waves .",
    "the scattering matrix contains information about not only quantities as the conductance and the characteristic dwelling times for electrons moving through the disordered region , but also on the energy levels of the system .",
    "the universal statistical properties found in the energy spectrum of disordered and chaotic systems have been related to the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrix hamiltonians @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the universal conductance fluctuations of metallic systems have been understood in terms of a statistical description of the transfer matrix @xcite . to understand the relation between these two universalities , it is useful to study the statistical properties of the scattering matrix @xcite .    due to current conservation , the scattering matrix is unitary and its eigenvalues are represented by @xmath1 phase shifts @xmath2 .",
    "( @xmath3 is the number of transverse channels in each asymptotic region . ) assuming that all matrices @xmath0 with a given symmetry are equally probable , we obtain dyson s circular ensembles @xcite ( named coe and cue for orthogonal and unitary symmetry classes , respectively ) , where the phase shift statistics follows universal laws .",
    "the isotropy hypothesis of dyson s ensembles applies only to ballistic chaotic cavities with no direct channels @xcite , where the electronic motion is essentially zero - dimensional after a ( short ) time of flight .",
    "the conductance in this systems is always of the order of @xmath4 since reflection and transmission are equally likely . on the other hand , in disordered systems",
    "this isotropy hypothesis is not satisfied any longer because transmission is much less probable than reflection . for quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) metallic samples the conductance is of the order of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the elastic mean - free - path , @xmath7 the length of the disordered region , and @xmath8 . in the localized regime , when the localization length @xmath9 is much smaller than the sample length @xmath7 , the typical conductance scales as @xmath10 .",
    "however , the failure of dyson s hypothesis for the mean values of @xmath0 ( which is linked to the average conductance ) does not prevent the fluctuations of @xmath0 for weakly - disordered quasi-1d samples to be ( approximately ) described with the universal behavior of the circular ensembles , as shown in ref .",
    "this good agreement gets poorer if the disorder is increased , as well as when the system does not have a quasi-1d geometry , or when it enters the localized regime . in the first two cases the mean values of the transmission and reflection amplitudes become strongly dependent on the channel index and the eigenphase distribution",
    "is highly anisotropic .",
    "when localization is achieved by keeping the disorder weak and increasing the length of the sample beyond the localization length , the scattering matrix was shown to decouple in two statistically independent ( almost unitary ) reflection matrices @xcite .",
    "this picture is particularly clear if one uses a semiclassical approach where most of the classical trajectories return to the region of departure instead of traversing the disordered sample .",
    "a few years ago , another type of universality in the spectrum of chaotic and disordered systems was discovered by szafer , altshuler , and simons @xcite .",
    "it concerns the adiabatic response to an external perturbation ( magnetic field , shape of the confining potential , etc ) .",
    "the correlator of the derivatives of the eigenenergies at two different values of the external parameter has a universal functional form once a proper rescaling is carried out .",
    "latter studies have found these universal parametric correlations to hold in a variety of other systems , including interacting one - dimensional models @xcite , @xmath11-dependent band structures of semiconductors @xcite , rydberg atoms in magnetic fields @xcite , etc . considering the @xmath1 eigenphases of @xmath0 as a function of the electron energy ,",
    "the natural question arises as to whether the analogous parametric correlations will have the universal form found for eigenenergies . in the weakly - disordered quasi-1d case , where the fluctuations of the eigenphases follow the circular ensemble predictions and @xmath12",
    ", one could anticipate that the parametric correlations do exhibit the universal form of szafer _ et al .",
    "_ , and this is confirmed here by numerical simulations and analytical arguments .",
    "more interesting is the question of what happens to these correlations as we go into the localized regime , and whether or not they can be described by a simple model as that of the decoupling of the eigenphases .",
    "directly related to the parametric correlations of the eigenphases , there is the question of the statistical distribution of the traversing - times in the disordered region .",
    "this distribution and the related correlation functions have recently begun to be addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , because the wigner time appears in a variety of physical phenomena , ranging from the capacitance of mesoscopic quantum dots @xcite to nuclear resonances @xcite .",
    "since the wigner time is obtained from the scattering matrix and its energy derivative , the statistical properties of @xmath13 determine the correlations of the traversal time .",
    "we aim in this paper to study the relationship between the parametric correlations and the distributions of the traversal times , and their connection to the statistical properties of the corresponding scattering matrix for metallic and localized quasi-1d disordered systems .    in the remaining of this section we introduce the basic notation concerning the scattering matrix and",
    "present the substantially different behavior of the eigenphases , conductance , and wigner time ( as functions of the fermi energy ) between the metallic and localized cases . in sec .",
    "[ sec : metallic ] we study the parametric correlations of weakly - disordered quasi-1d systems .",
    "we justify their universal character in the framework of a brownian - motion model for unitary matrices .",
    "we then study the energy correlations of the conductance and the wigner time and the cross - correlation between these two quantities , making contact with existing calculations in the metallic regime . in sec .",
    "[ sec : localized ] we undertake similar studies for the localized regime .",
    "the non - universal parametric correlations of eigenphases and wigner times can be accounted for , at the semi - quantitative level , by a very simple model of resonant transmission through a single localized state .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] . in appendix",
    "[ appa ] , we discuss the validity of the assumption on which is based the brownian motion model , when it is used to describe the energy dependence of @xmath0 . in this case , this amounts to study the underlying wigner - smith time delay matrix . in appendix [ appb ]",
    "we consider the simple case of one - channel scattering , where some exact calculations can be carried out .",
    "we consider an infinite stripe composed of two semi - infinite , perfectly conducting regions of width @xmath14 ( which we define as the leads ) connected by a disordered region of same width and of longitudinal length @xmath15 ( see the inset in fig.[preview].a ) .",
    "assuming non - interacting electrons and hard - wall boundary conditions for the transverse part of the wave function , the scattering states in the leads at the fermi energy satisfy the condition @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fermi wave vector , @xmath18 the quantized transverse wave vector , and @xmath19 the longitudinal wave vector . for a given @xmath17 , each real transverse momenta labeled by the index @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) define a propagating channel in the leads .",

    "in our numerical work we obtain the transmission and reflection amplitudes from the green s function of the disordered stripe by a recursive algorithm @xcite on a tight - binding lattice .",
    "we typically use a rectangular lattice of @xmath49 sites and go from the metallic to the localized regime by increasing the on - site disorder @xmath50 .",

    "notice that the landauer formula requires that the sample is a single , complex elastic scatterer .",
    "thus , we are ignoring any inelastic process giving rise to a loss of phase coherence .",
    "for a given sample ( i.e. , impurity configuration ) the diagonalization of the scattering matrix leads to @xmath1 phase shifts @xmath2 as functions of the fermi energy @xmath53 .",
    "the typical dependence is shown in fig .  [ preview ] for the metallic ( a ) and localized ( b ) cases for an energy interval where new channels are not open ( @xmath54 in the whole interval ) . in the metallic case",
    "the on - site disorder in anderson units is @xmath55 , yielding a mean - free - path @xmath56 , a localization length @xmath57 , and a conductance ( thick solid line ) which fluctuates around a mean value @xmath58 .",
    "the localized regime ( @xmath59 , yielding @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) exhibits a markedly different behavior , with phase shifts showing step - like jumps where the conductance has peaks .",
    "the peaks indicate that , for certain energies , the probability of traversing the disordered region is much higher than the average .",
    "they are related to the existence of localized eigenstates in the sample and transport through the strongly - disordered region is dominated by resonant tunneling .    to illustrate this last point , in fig .",

    "this characteristic time scale is defined as the trace of the wigner - smith matrix @xmath62 namely , @xmath63 the unitarity of @xmath0 trivially implies the fact that @xmath64 is hermitian , and therefore its eigenvalues are real . in the case of time - reversal symmetry @xmath65 , but @xmath64 is not necessarily symmetric since in general @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not commute .",
    "working in a base that diagonalizes @xmath0 it is easy to see that @xmath68 admits a simple expression in terms of the energy derivatives of the phase shifts , @xmath69 the wigner time can be interpreted as the typical time interval a scattered particle remains in the disordered region @xcite . in the localized regime",
    ", the wigner time exhibits the same resonant - like structure of the conductance , although peak heights can be relatively different .",
    "this behavior can be understood in the light of the resonant - tunneling mechanism , since each localized state present in the disordered region can trap the electrons for a long time @xcite . from this mechanism",
    "one can also understand qualitatively why a wigner - time peak can be relatively large when , at the same energy , a conductance peak is small .",
    "this may happen , for instance , when the tunneling probability rates for channels in lead i is much larger than for channels in lead ii .",
    "we will get back to this discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : localized ] .",
    "a strong correlation between @xmath70 and @xmath68 is also obtained in the metallic regime .",
    "the correlation in this case is also intuitive , since transport should probe the available density of states around the considered fermi energy .",

    "[ universal ] , namely , that the _ energy _ correlator of eigenphase velocities falls into the analogous curve obtained from energy eigenvalues when the number of channels is very large .",
    "parallel to the field - theoretical approach , the universality of parametric correlators of eigenvalues has also been justified from the hypothesis of a brownian motion of the eigenenergies @xcite , with the external parameter playing the role of a fictitious time .",
    "the brownian - motion model ( bmm ) for hermitian and unitary matrices was introduced by dyson @xcite and used by pandey and collaborators @xcite in the case of circular ensembles in order to determine the statistics of the eigenphases at the crossover between different symmetry classes .",
    "more recently , the bmm has been applied to scattering and transmission matrices describing coherent transport through chaotic and disordered systems @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized in these works that the bmm approach for scattering matrices only obtains correct results for a restricted ( energy or magnetic field ) range , or for sufficiently large number of channels .",
    "we will illustrate this point in the next subsection , where we consider specifically the energy evolution of the phase shifts .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to develop a simple description of the parametric statistics of phase shifts in the metallic regime numerically investigated ( @xmath87 ) . for this purpose",
    ", we apply a brownian - motion model to the energy evolution of scattering matrices .",
    "as stated at the end of the previous subsection , we do not expect to obtain a complete quantitative agreement between the bbm predictions and the numerical data - this certainly would require a more sophisticated treatment @xcite . instead , we only give a justification for the agreement observed between the asymptotics of the energy - dependent eigenphase correlation functions and analogous curves characteristic of hamiltonian eigenvalues .",
    "a unitary matrix @xmath0 can always be decomposed as the product @xmath88 of two unitary matrices . in the absence of time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath0 is just unitary and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are independent . for time - reversal symmetric systems ( @xmath92 ) ,",

    "we now turn to the solution of the fokker - planck equation for the joint probability distribution of the eigenphases . an exact way to solve eq .",
    "( [ fokkerplanck ] ) is to map it into a quantum - mechanical hamiltonian problem of particles in a ring interacting by a two - body potential proportional to @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the length of the chord connecting the pair .",

    "alternatively , one may use a hydrodynamical approximation , originally proposed by dyson @xcite , which leads to a non - linear diffusion equation for the average density of eigenphases . here",
    "we will adopt this second approach , since it is simpler than the first one and sufficient for our purposes .",
