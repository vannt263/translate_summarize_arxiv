    "wrought aluminum - magnesium alloys ( international alloy designation system : 5xxx , mg content : 5.6% maximum ) are commonly used in applications where good workability , very good resistance to corrosion , high fatigue strength are desidered .",
    "example of applications are : oil , fuel lines and tanks , pressure cryogenic vessels , marine structures and fittings , automotive and architectural components .",
    "the alloy al  5056 ( 5.2% mg , 0.1% mn , 0.1% cr ) is the material of the test mass of gravitational wave ( gw ) resonant antennas auriga@xcite , explorer@xcite , nautilus@xcite in italy and allegro@xcite in the united states , operated at liquid helium temperature and below . during the last decade , all these detectors took part , as a network , in coordinated searches for impulsive gw excitations ( no gw events were detected).@xcite    the test mass of the gw resonant antennas is a suspended cylinder ( @xmath6  2300 kg mass ) , acting as a mechanical resonator whose resonances are excited by the incoming gw .",
    "the elastic vibrations are converted to electrical signals by a transducer system .",
    "the minimum detectable energy of a gw resonant antenna inversely depends on @xmath7 , the acoustic quality factor of the material also known as the inverse of the internal friction .",
    "al  5056 was chosen as the material for the gw antennas due to the high values of @xmath7,@xcite exhibited at very low temperatures .",
    "baron and r.  hofstadter first measured@xcite mechanical oscillations in piezoelectric disks penetrated by high energy electron beams and they outlined the possibility that cosmic ray ( cr ) events could excite mechanical vibrations in a metallic cylinder at its resonant frequency and that these events could mimic gw events detected by resonant antennas .",
    "nautilus has been equipped with a cr detector@xcite to study the interactions caused by crs and to provide a veto against the cr induced events in the antenna .",
    "correlating nautilus data with cr observations , the following results were obtained : 1 ) the rate of high energy signals due to cr showers was larger than expectations@xcite when the antenna was operated at a temperature @xmath8 , _ i.e. _  well below the transition temperature from normal - conducting @xmath9 to superconducting @xmath10 states of al  5056;@xcite 2 ) this feature was not observed when the antenna was operated at @xmath11 , _ i.e. _  above the transition temperature.@xcite + since these findings had not a straightforward interpretation , we performed an experiment ( rap ) aimed at measuring the longitudinal oscillations of a small suspended al  5056 cylinder hit by an electron beam of known energy .",
    "the rap experiment , performed at the beam test facility ( btf)@xcite of the dafne @xmath12-factory complex in the infn frascati laboratory , has shown that 1 ) the amplitude of the longitudinal oscillations of the cylinder hit by ionizing particles depends on the state of conduction of the material@xcite and that 2 ) the observed amplitudes are consistent with the amplitudes measured by nautilus in cr events both in @xmath9 and @xmath10 states.@xcite moreover , the amplitude can be evaluated in the framework of the thermo - acoustic model : in the @xmath9 state it depends on the ratio of the thermal expansion coefficient to the specific heat , this ratio being part of the definition of the grneisen parameter . in the @xmath10 state",
    "the amplitude also depends on the fractional volume change between the @xmath10 and @xmath9 states . in principle , the relevant thermophysical properties of the al  5056 at low temperature are not known with sufficient precision to allow the comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the amplitude predicted by the model . however , our confidence in the model is also based on the small discrepancy , of the order of 15% , between the amplitudes measured in the alloy and those computed by using the data for pure aluminum in the region 4.5@xmath13 264  k.@xcite    direct measurements of the grneisen parameter of elastic materials have been reported:@xcite the authors used pulsed electron beams hitting the front surface of a thin slab , and measured the induced motion on the rear face surface .",
    "the equation of motion describing thermoelastic effects depends on the grneisen parameter and on the energy deposited by the beam in the slab .",
    "the measurement of the displacement , the knowledge of the deposited energy and the use of the equation of motion allowed them to directly determine the grneisen parameter .    in a similar way",
    "this paper presents experimental results on the linear expansion coefficient of the aluminum alloy above and below the temperature of transition between the @xmath10 and @xmath9 state . in order to determine the coefficient we use : a ) the oscillation amplitude measurements , b ) the equations describing the amplitude in the framework of the thermo - acoustic model , c ) the measurements of the deposited energy by the electron beam , obtained by the product of the measured beam multiplicity and the calculated energy loss in the material by each particle , and d ) an independent measurement of the specific heat",
    "we consider a cylinder ( radius @xmath14 , length @xmath15 , mass @xmath16 ) that is suspended in correspondence of the middle section , with its axis horizontal . a ionizing particle , after hitting the lateral surface of the cylinder and interacting with the material , generates a pressure pulse in the bulk .",
    "this sonic pulse is the result of the local thermal expansion of the material caused by the warming up due to the energy lost by the particle in the material .",
    "the sonic pulse determines the excitation of the vibrational oscillation modes of the suspended bar . by introducing a vector field @xmath17 to describe the local displacements from equilibrium",
    ", we express the amplitude of the @xmath18-th longitudinal mode of oscillation as proportional to the quantity:@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pressure pulse due to the sonic source described above , @xmath21 is the mass density , @xmath22 is the energy loss per unit length of the interacting particle , @xmath23 is the cross section of the tubular zone centered on the particle path in which the effects are generated and @xmath24 is a line integral over the particle path involving the normal mode of oscillation @xmath25 . in the previous relation @xmath26 is the adimensional grneisen parameter : @xmath27 with @xmath28 the volume thermal expansion coefficient ( @xmath29 for cubic elements ) , @xmath30 the isochoric specific heat and @xmath31 the isothermal bulk module .",

    "@xmath34 is the total energy released in the bar by the particle beam .",
    "the experimental conditions of rap are close to this particular case and the amplitude maximum of the fundamental longitudinal mode of oscillation is the observable measured by the experiment .",
    "however , in order to model the amplitude in the most realistic way , we have performed a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation,@xcite which takes into account the corrections @xmath35 $ ] for the modes of oscillation of a cylinder , the transverse dimension of the electron beam at the impact point and the trajectories of the secondary particles generated by the electron interactions in the bar .",
    "all these effects are summarized in a corrective parameter @xmath36 and the amplitude maximum of the fundamental longitudinal mode of oscillation is modeled by :    @xmath37    the value of @xmath36 for the aluminum alloy bar used in the experiment is estimated by mc to be -0.04 .",
    "the energy released by the ionizing particles to the material determines the suppression of the superconductivity in a region ( hot spot ) centered around the particle path .",
    "the maximum value of the hot spot radius , @xmath38 , is obtained by equating the energy lost per unit length by the particle , @xmath22 , to the enthalpy variation in the volume undergoing the @xmath39 transition at temperature @xmath40:@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the enthalpy change per unit volume and @xmath43 is the cross section of the zone switched to the @xmath9 state .",
    "the amplitude of the longitudinal oscillations is the sum of two terms , one related to thermodynamic effects in the @xmath39 transition and the other to the thermal effects in the region switched to the @xmath9 state , which have been already described in the section  [ nstate ] .",

    "the frequency of the fundamental longitudinal mode of oscillation of the bar is @xmath68  hz below @xmath69  k. the cryostat is equipped with a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the temperatures are measured inside the cryostat by 11 thermometers controlled by two multi - channel resistance bridges and , among them , a calibrated @xmath70 resistor measures the temperature of one of the bar end faces with an accuracy of 0.01  k below @xmath69  k. two piezoelectric ceramics ( pz ) , electrically connected in parallel , are inserted in a slot cut in the position opposite to the bar suspension point and are squeezed when the bar shrinks . in this pz arrangement",
    "the strain measured at the bar center is proportional to the displacement of the bar end faces .",
    "the pz output is first amplified and then sampled at 100  khz by an adc embedded in a vme system dedicated to the data acquisition . a pz calibration procedure , performed before each run of data taking , provides the factor converting the adc samples into the displacements of the bar end faces .",
    "a software filtering algorithm , known as `` digital lock - in '' , extracts the fourier component at the frequency @xmath71 from the time sequence formed by the adc samples before and after the beam hit , determining the amplitude of the induced fundamental oscillation .",

    "two sources of error affect the vibration maximum amplitude : the first is an overall systematic error of the order of @xmath81 , that accounts for the slightly different set - up and calibration procedures implemented in the runs over two years and the second is related to the noise in the measurement of the oscillation amplitude ( @xmath82  m ) .",
