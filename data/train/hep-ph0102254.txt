    "in studying the relationship between theoretical predictions and experimental data , it is important to connect measured quantities with the most elementary theoretical objects to check direct consequences of the theory without essential use of model assumptions .",

    ", there is rich experimental material obtained from hadronic decays of the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "the first theoretical analysis of hadronic decays of a heavy lepton was performed in 1971  @xcite well before the experimental discovery of the @xmath0-lepton in 1975 . since then",
    ", the properties of the @xmath0 have been studied very intensively .",
    "the ratio of hadronic to leptonic widths for the inclusive decay of the @xmath0-lepton , @xmath3 is the most precise one for extracting of the values of the fundamental qcd parameters at a low energy scale @xcite .",
    "the initial theoretical expression for @xmath4 contains an integral over timelike momentum @xmath5 which extends down to small @xmath6 and can not be directly calculated in the framework of standard perturbation theory  ( pt ) .",
    "indeed , the hadronic correlation function @xmath7 is parametrized by the perturbative running coupling which has unphysical singularities and , therefore , is ill - defined in the region of small momenta . to avoid this problem ,",
    "one usually applies the following procedure .",
    "the initial integral  ( [ eq.1 ] ) is rewritten by using the cauchy theorem in the form of a contour integral in the complex plane with the contour running around a circle with radius @xmath8  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the adler function .",
    "this trick allows one , in principle , to avoid the problem of a direct calculation of the @xmath4 ratio by eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "however , in order to perform this transformation self - consistently , it is necessary to maintain correct analytic properties of the hadronic correlation function , which are violated in the framework of standard pt .",
    "the analytic approach to qcd  @xcite , the so - called analytic perturbation theory  ( apt )  @xcite , maintains needed analytic properties and allows one to give meaning to the initial expression .",
    "the apt description can be equivalently phrased either on the basis of the expression  ( [ eq.1 ] ) or on the contour representation  ( [ eq.2 ] )  @xcite .",
    "the information obtained in @xmath0 measurements allows one to construct various `` experimental '' curves .",
    "in particular , in paper @xcite a quantity @xmath11 with a variable  mass \" @xmath12 , has been considered .",
    "this quantity , defined for timelike momenta , is similar to the  smeared \" functions constructed , for example , according to the poggio - quinn - weinberg method @xcite .",

    "we study the adler @xmath13-function corresponding to @xmath0 decay mediated by the non - strange vector current via @xmath14 .",
    "we use the apt method which does not encounter the problem of unphysical singularities of the running coupling and gives a self - consistent description of both the timelike , eq .",

    "the region of integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) includes the vicinity of the quark - antiquark threshold .",
    "the perturbative expansion breaks down in this neighborhood due to singularities at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus any finite order of the perturbative expansion is unreliable near quark thresholds and , therefore , all singular terms of the @xmath16 type , where @xmath17 is the relative velocity of the quarks , have to be summed . note that this problem can not be avoided by using the contour representation ( [ eq.2 ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) , because these expressions should be equivalent to each other in the framework of a consistent method . for heavy quark systems one usually uses the nonrelativistic resummation factor obtained by using the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential , which is known as the sommerfeld - sakharov factor  @xcite .",
    "but for a systematic description of the threshold region in the system of light quarks it is necessary to apply a relativistic approach . here , we take into account threshold effects by using a new relativistic resummation factor proposed in ref .",

    "we start our consideration with a three - loop pt and apt analysis , neglecting , in the beginning , quark masses .",
    "it is convenient to separate the qcd contribution by representing the @xmath4 ratio in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 corresponds to the parton level description and @xmath20 is the qcd correction .",
    "we introduce qcd contributions to the imaginary part of the hadronic correlator , @xmath21 , and to the corresponding adler function , @xmath22 as follows : @xmath23 then , one can write @xmath20 as an integral over timelike momentum ( minkowskian region ) @xmath24 or as a contour integral in the complex plane ( euclidean region ) @xmath25    we now consider @xmath20 in the framework the pt and apt methods .      the pt description is based on the contour representation and can be developed in the following two ways . in braaten s ( br )",

    "the correlator parametrized , as usual , by the pt running coupling does not have this virtue . moreover",
    ", the conventional renormalization group method determines the running coupling in the spacelike region , whereas the initial expression ( [ eq.1 ] ) contains an integration over timelike momentum , and there is the question of how to parametrize a quantity defined for timelike momentum transfers  @xcite . to perform this procedure self - consistently , it is important to maintain correct analytic properties of the hadronic correlator @xcite . because of this failure of analyticity , eqs .",

    "<S> the method of analytic perturbation theory , which avoids the problem of ghost - pole type singularities and gives a self - consistent description of both spacelike and timelike regions , is applied to describe the  light \" adler function corresponding to the non - strange vector channel of the inclusive decay of the @xmath0 lepton . </S>",
    "<S> the role of threshold effects is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the quark - antiquark system near threshold is described by using a new relativistic resummation factor . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the method proposed leads to good agreement with the `` experimental '' adler function down to the lowest energy scale . </S>"
