    "acceleration in the expansion rate of the universe was first realised at the very end of the @xmath3 century with the sne ia observations  @xcite . since then",
    ", the cause of this phenomenon has become one of the most prominent questions in cosmology . among the mainstream explanations",
    "are the cosmological constant @xmath4 , scalar field dark energy ( quintessence  @xcite , phantom  @xcite , etc . ) , modified gravity  @xcite and braneworld scenarios  @xcite .    how _ do _",
    "these observations tell us about the acceleration of the universe ?",
    "they consist of measurements of redshift @xmath5 and distance modulus @xmath6 for each supernova .",
    "since the type ia supernovae are taken as standard candles  @xcite , the distance moduli can be converted to luminosity distances @xmath7 .",
    "one interprets them in the framework of the frw cosmological models , which follow from the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy the celebrated cosmological principle introduced by einstein and amply verified by the high degree of isotropy of the cosmic background radiation and leads to a description of the spacetime metric of the universe in terms of a single function @xmath0 , the _ scale factor_. in these models , the relation between the redshift and scale factor is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 denoting the age of the universe .",
    "then the luminosity distance of a source at redshift @xmath5 is determined by the expansion history of the universe as  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is given ) , the large round parenthesis contains the argument of the function @xmath13 ; it is not a factor multiplying the expression @xmath13 .",
    "] by @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the curvature parameter which takes values ( @xmath16 ) for spatially open , flat or closed universes respectively , and @xmath17 the hubble parameter .",
    "note that these results follow from the assumption of the frw metric , without using einstein or alternative theory of gravity .    simply put ,",
    "the observations found supernovae at a given redshift @xmath5 to be _ fainter _ than what would be expected even for an empty flat universe , i.e. for one with @xmath18 , that is , with zero acceleration / deceleration .",
    "this faintness puts the sources farther away as compared to the empty universe , hence farther back in time , due to the constant speed of light . on the other hand , by eq.([scalefactorredshift ] ) the redshift gives the size of the universe at the emission of the light , hence the faintness pushes the bottom of the @xmath19  vs.  @xmath20 curve to the left , hence acceleration .    the original works  @xcite used the @xmath4cdm model , i.e. assumed that the universe is dominated by matter [ corresponding to a perfect fluid with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath21 ; and some of it possibly dark , although this does not matter for the einstein equations ] , since we know that matter exists in the universe , and a cosmological constant ( corresponding to a perfect fluid with eos @xmath22 ) as the agent causing the acceleration .",
    "they parametrized the contributions of matter and cosmological constant as fractions of the so - called _ critical density _ , called @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and performed fits of the data to the @xmath1 functions calculated for assumed values of these parameters . on the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane ,",
    "the best fits they found suggested that @xmath25 , consistent with an accelerating universe .",
    "the best fits give very weak constraints on the sum @xmath26 determining the curvature of the universe , however ; that quantity was first meaningfully constrained by the measurement of the location of the first peak in the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation  @xcite .",
    "of course , other models have been put forward since , e.g. featuring fluids with different eos s . to evaluate any such theory , or determine the best values of the theory s parameters ,",
    "usually the same procedure is followed ; i.e. @xmath0 is determined from the assumptions of the theory , then @xmath1 is evaluated using eq.([eq : lumdisfroma ] ) , and checked against the data to assess the viability of the model .",
    "however , the procedure of going from a predicted @xmath0 to a predicted @xmath1 can in principle be inverted .",
    "we can solve for @xmath27 from eq.([eq : lumdisfroma ] ) : @xmath28 ,                 \\label{lookback}\\ ] ] where the curvature @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 as mentioned above , we keep the @xmath29-term , since the sne ia data do not tell us that the universe is flat ( or otherwise ) .",
    "once @xmath27 is determined , this function can in principle be inverted to give @xmath31 .",
    "hence , if we have good knowledge of the function @xmath1 if the integration ( [ lookback ] ) and subsequent inversion can be performed analytically , we would have a good candidate for an analytical expression for the expansion history of the universe via eq.([scalefactorredshift ] ) .",
    "then the derivatives of that function would reveal the history of the hubble parameter , and periods of acceleration or deceleration .    since no theory of gravity ( einstein or modified ) or assumption about the content of the universe is used , this is called a _ model - independent approach _ , or since the emphasis is on simply determining the unknown metric function of the universe , occasionally _ cosmography _",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we follow this approach .",
    "we fit families of functions to the @xmath1 data , and determine the best fitting member of each family .",
    "the choice of function families is not motivated by a physical model we have in mind , rather by possible simplicity of the analytical operations .",
    "trying to find good fits to @xmath1 rather than to @xmath0 , or some combination of its derivatives such as the deceleration parameter @xmath32 , etc .",
    "is better - motivated , since the observationally measured function is @xmath1 .",
    "we also use alternative redshift variables in addition to the conventional redshift @xmath5 , introducing one of our own , and denoting them by @xmath33 .",
    "we compare goodness of fit of the results with each other , and in particular , with the standard model of cosmology , the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "we find that none of the models we investigated fits meaningfully better than @xmath4cdm .",
    "then we attempt to extract all the possible information about the expansion history of the universe , including periods of acceleration and deceleration .",
    "it turns out that not much analytical progress can be achieved in terms of the time @xmath20 , but both the first and second time - derivatives of the scale function @xmath0 can be evaluated _ in terms of a redshift variable @xmath33 _ analytically , once an analytical result for @xmath34 is assumed .",
    "we find that while the sne ia data _ strongly suggest _ that the present acceleration of the universe is positive , they _ by themselves _ can not tell us that the universe was decelerating in the past . however , we find that including the grb luminosity - distance data improves the situation , even though they are much fewer in number , subject to much larger uncertainties , and not _ really _ model - independent .",
    "we also rederive the result that _ for given @xmath34 _ , the present value of acceleration of the universe is independent of its curvature ( of course , for frw models ) , contrary to some claims in the literature ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1 ) ) .",
    "when we finally _ do _ use einstein s equations to derive conclusions about the content of the universe in the past according to general relativity , we find that there is a special value of redshift at which the density of the universe is independent of its curvature _ for a given @xmath34 .",
    "_ we use this fact to put an upper limit on the matter density of the universe , leading to a lower limit on dark energy .",
    "we also investigate the evolution of the total eos parameter , all analyses performed _ using only the sn+grb data_.",
    "the conventional redshift @xmath5 is not the only possible redshift variable , not necessarily even the best variable to work with .",
    "cosmography has usually been the effort to extract as many taylor expansion coefficients as possible of various cosmological functions as functions of time or redshift ; for example , the hubble and deceleration parameters as first and second terms .",
    "but one look at eq.([scalefactorredshift ] ) shows that the radius of convergence of the taylor series for @xmath35 is 1 , hence some such taylor series will not be reliable beyond @xmath36  @xcite ; and alternative redshift variables have been used in the literature @xcite .",
    "we will use these variables too , and introduce one of our own .",
    "we will occasionally denote the conventional redshift @xmath5 by @xmath37 .",
    "the first alternative variable is  @xcite @xmath38 other alternatives introduced in @xcite are @xmath39 we introduce @xmath40 and also will use the almost - trivial @xmath41 .",
    "[ redshifts ]    behaviours of the different redshift variables as function of the scale factor are shown in fig [ redshifts ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath42 does not change monotonically with @xmath5 , therefore @xmath0 , hence we will not use that variable .      to determine candidate functions for @xmath43 , we choose 7 families of functions ( see table [ introducingfamilies ] ) to fit to the data , that is , the union 2.1 dataset  @xcite , with @xmath44 minimisation .",
    "to be as generic as possible we start with polynomials with no constant term [ except when using @xmath41 , when the constant term is determined in terms of the coefficients of the other powers such that @xmath45 .",
    "the second and third families are polynomials multiplied by an exponential function where the exponent is linear and quadratic in @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we extend the spectrum by introducing three more families which are the first three families multiplied by @xmath46 ; this is done to simplify ( [ lookback ] ) where division of @xmath7 by @xmath46 is present .",
    "of course , when an alternative redshift variable is used , this factor is expressed in terms of that variable , e.g. @xmath47 .",
    "one further generalisation of polynomials is the pade approximant @xcite which is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath50 order polynomial with constant term set to zero ; and we have added one family consisting of pade approximants multiplied by @xmath51 .",
    "[ h ! ]    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tablezstar ]    for the total current density of the universe we have @xmath52 where the first equality easily follows from ( [ firsteinstein ] ) , and the others from our definitions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . since the density of radiation is negligible in the recent universe , the gap between these @xmath55 values and the numbers in table [ tablezstar ] point to the existence of something else in the universe , the lower limit on whose current density is @xmath56 in principle , it is also possible to put upper limits on radiation energy density of the universe in a similar manner .",
    "however these limits will be about four orders of magnitude higher than the energy density of the cosmic background radiation , so they can not meaningfully limit the number of relativistic species filling the universe .",
    "considering the possibility of very large number of ( sterile ) massless particle species will give a smaller upper limit on the current density of matter+radiation , hence a larger lower limit on the density of _ dark energy_. hence we quote ( [ eq : de_limit ] ) as our result .",
    "we can also use the second einstein s equation which will give effective pressure @xmath57 of the content of the universe . dividing it by the energy density",
    "we get @xmath58 ; effective equation of state parameter for the universe ( fig.[fig : eosparameter ] )    [ fig : eosparameter ]    again we see an intersection point similar to the one in figure [ fig : rho_y5_f7 ] .",
    "with hindsight , we can analytically predict this point too , but it does not seem to have any physical significance .",
    "we find the current value of @xmath59 to be between -0.7 and -0.9 depending on the assumption for curvature , with an estimated error of 0.015 .",
    "it should be noted that this is the total eos parameter , not the @xmath59 of dark energy , which is reported in recent literature  @xcite with a central value less than -1 ; the two statements are not inconsistent .",
    "extrapolation to the future however , shows a trend toward phantom - domination .",
    "we have fit various functions to the cosmological luminosity distance data , mostly the union 2.1 type ia supernovae , and tried to extract information about the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the anstze used for the luminosity distance function @xmath1 were motivated not by any physical model , but by facilitation of the operations for going from the function @xmath1 to the function @xmath0 , the scale factor of the universe .",
    "we first took the number of parameters in the @xmath1 anstze variable , forming families , and for each family we took the member with the minimum @xmath60/d.o.f .",
    "we also tried a number of different redshift variables .",
    "we found that in some models it does not make sense to try to extract more than two cosmological parameters , although this number is more often three or four , up to six in some models .",
    "we found that pade approximants and expressions involving @xmath61 as a factor give slightly better fits to @xmath1 data than polynomials of the redshift variables , possibly multiplied by linear or quadratic exponentials of the same .",
    "yet we found that no model fits significantly better than @xmath4cdm .",
    "we demonstrated that _ for `` measured '' @xmath1 function _ , the current acceleration of the universe does not depend on its curvature ( a previously found , but not widely known result ) .",
    "but we found that the supernova data are too scattered and have too large errors to _ by themselves _",
    "show a transition from deceleration to acceleration in the past of the universe , at least not for the anstze we used .",
    "we decided that the procedural problem lies in the convergence properties of polynomials , which form components of the anstze ; and decided that it is possible to tame these divergences by including grb data which reach out to much higher redshifts .",
    "even though they are not really model - independent , we argue that due to their comparatively small number and large uncertainties , the work will not be contaminated much with physical models , while still serving to tame the dominance of higher order powers in polynomials . with their inclusion , we found the deceleration - acceleration transition at redshift @xmath62 for a flat universe , larger ( earlier ) for positive spatial curvature , and smaller ( later ) for negative .    finally assuming einstein gravity",
    ", we found that there is a special redshift value , call it @xmath63 , at which the density of the universe is independent of its curvature , again _ for `` measured '' @xmath1 function_. this enables us to put an upper limit of roughly @xmath64 on the current density parameter of matter , dark or not , _ using only the luminosity distance data_. this translates into a lower limit for current _ dark energy _ density parameter of roughly 0.3 , assuming the `` worst '' case for the curvature of the universe .",
    "we can also find the total eos parameter @xmath65 for the universe ; we find that the eos is not yet _ phantom _ , but it seems to be evolving in that direction .",
    "of course , assuming an alternative theory of gravitation would bring ( possibly qualitatively ) different interpretations than in these last two paragraphs .",
    "the coming decades should bring an increase in the number of the sne ia observations .",
    "if technology improves such that the uncertainties of the luminosity measurements decrease , it should be possible to find better fits ; however , the scatter should also decrease for those fits to make more sense and the reconstruction of the scale factor function and other inferences made in this work to be more reliable .",
    "there is recent work @xcite suggesting that type ia supernovae might not be all identical after all , a potential development reminiscent of the discovery of the different types of cepheids in 1940 s .",
    "if confirmed , this would also lead to a reevaluation of existing data , possibly decreasing the scatter , and together with the new data , might lead to the required improvement .",
