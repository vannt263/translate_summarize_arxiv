    "in particular for each @xmath47 we have @xmath48 is biholomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath49 coincides with the original embedding @xmath50 . *",
    "the fiber @xmath51 is the algebraic torus @xmath6 embedded in @xmath52 via a monomial map @xmath36 for some finite set @xmath53 and @xmath54 as above . *",
    "the map @xmath17 has no critical points , i.e. @xmath55 is nonzero at every point in @xmath3 .    next consider a smooth projective variety @xmath0 equipped with a very ample line bundle @xmath14 .",
    "the line bundle @xmath14 gives rise to the kodaira embedding @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a khler form in the class @xmath13 .",
    "we note that by moser s trick any two khler forms in @xmath13 are symplectomorphic .",
    "in particular @xmath7 is symplectomorphic to the pull - back of a fubini - study khler form on the projective space @xmath57 to @xmath0 .",
    "using the family @xmath3 above we prove the following ( theorem [ th - main ] ) :    [ th - u - torus - intro ] there exists an open subset @xmath23 ( in the usual classical topology ) such that @xmath25 is symplectomorphic to @xmath41 , for some @xmath53 and @xmath54 as above ( i.e. @xmath28 is a finite subset such that the differences of elements in @xmath28 generate the lattice @xmath21 ) .",

    ", this result claims that _ in symplectic category and over arbitrarily large open subsets , any smooth projective variety looks like a toric variety equipped with a toric khler form . _    in section [ sec - gw - packing ] we discuss some applications of theorem [ th - u - large - intro ] to symplectic topology . before explaining these applications here",
    "let us briefly recall some important concepts from symplectic topology .",
    "the famous _ non - squeezing theorem _ of gromov states that a ball @xmath62 of radius @xmath63 , in the symplectic vector space @xmath64 with the standard structure , can not be embedded symplectically into a cylinder @xmath65 of radius @xmath66 , unless @xmath67 .",
    "hence , the non - squeezing theorem tells us that , while symplectic maps are volume - preserving , it is much more restrictive for a map to be symplectic than it is to be volume - preserving ( @xcite ) . motivated by the gromov non - squeezing theorem , one introduces the notion of the _ gromov width _ which is an important invariant of a symplectic manifold .",
    "it is defined as the supremum of capacities of symplectic balls that can be embedded in the manifold .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath12 be a symplectic manifold of ( real ) dimension @xmath68 .",
    "consider the ball of radius @xmath63 : @xmath69 equipped with the standard symplectic form @xmath70 .",
    "the quantity @xmath71 is usually referred to as the _ capacity _ of the ball @xmath62 . the gromov width of @xmath12 is the supremum of the set @xmath72 .",
    "another related concept is that of a symplectic packing .",
    "as above let @xmath12 be a symplectic manifold of ( real ) dimension @xmath68 .",
    "fix an integer @xmath73 .",
    "a _ symplectic packing of @xmath74 by @xmath75 equal balls of radius @xmath63 _ is a symplectic embedding : @xmath76 of a disjoint union of @xmath75 balls of equal radius @xmath63 into @xmath77 .",
    "the darboux theorem ensures that , given @xmath75 , such a packing always exists provided that the radius @xmath63 is small enough .",
    "but when we increase the radius @xmath63 there will be obstructions for existence of a packing .",
    "an obvious obstruction is the total volume of the packing , since a symplectic embedding preserves the volume . in symplectic packing theory one",
    "investigates other obstructions for symplectic packings beyond the obvious volume obstruction .",
    "one defines : @xmath78 where the supremum is over all the radii @xmath63 for which there is a symplectic packing of @xmath12 with @xmath75 balls of radius @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath79 one says that @xmath12 has a _ full symplectic packing _ by @xmath75 equal balls .",
    "if @xmath80 one says that there is a _ packing obstruction _ ( see @xcite ) .    now let @xmath0 be a smooth complex projective variety with an ample line bundle @xmath14 and a khler form @xmath7 in @xmath13 . in section [ sec - gw - packing ]",
    "we show the following .",
    "* we give a lower bound for the gromov width of @xmath12 in terms of an associated convex body @xmath81 , namely its newton - okounkov body ( see section [ sec - enlarge ] for the definition of a newton - okounkov body ) .",
    "more precisely the gromov width is at least the supremum of the sizes of simplices that lie in the interior of a newton - okounkov body of @xmath16 ( see definition [ def - size - simplex ] and corollary [ cor - gw - no - body ] ) .",
    "in particular , this implies that when @xmath14 is very ample the gromov width of @xmath12 is at least @xmath82 .",
    "* moreover , we show that when @xmath14 is very ample the symplectic manifold @xmath12 has a full symplectic packing by @xmath15 equal balls , where @xmath15 is the degree of the line bundle @xmath14 ( i.e. the self - intersection number of its divisor class ) .",
    "paul biran has asked whether the gromov width of a compact symplectic manifold is at least @xmath82 if the symplectic form is integral .",
    "as said above , our approach in particular confirms this for smooth projective varieties and very ample line bundles . the fact that the gromov width in the case of a very ample line bundle is at least @xmath82 can be obtained by other methods involving the notion of seshadri constant ( see ( *",
    "* theorem 5.1.22 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "as suggested to the author by robert lazarsfeld , the construction of the family @xmath3 and its embedding in this paper , may be useful in approaching the ein - lazarsfeld conjecture .",
    "it states that the seshadri constant of an ample line bundle on a smooth projective variety is at least @xmath82 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 5.2.4 ) ) .",
    "this conjecture implies biran s conjecture for smooth projective varieties and ample line bundles .",
    "we would like to point out that after the first version of the present paper was posted on arxiv.org , following the methods and ideas here , witt nystrm proved a khler version of the statement about symplectic ball embeddings ( @xcite ) .",
    "also after the first version of the paper appeared we learned about the work of atsushi ito on seshadri constants ( @xcite ) .",
    "our lower bound on the gromov width in terms of the size of the largest simplex is closely related to the result in @xcite in which the author obtains similar bounds for the seshadri constants using different methods .",
    "finally we would like to mention the recent interesting papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in there the authors prove criteria for positivity of line bundles in terms of their associated newton - okounkov bodies .",
    "in particular , in the case of surfaces they prove a lower bound for the seshdari constant ( ( * ? ? ? * proposition 4.7 ) ) .",
    "as mentioned before , the construction of the family @xmath3 and its embedding in @xmath83 in this paper is a generalization of the deformation to the normal cone and is related to the rees algebra construction in commutative algebra .",
    "nevertheless in this paper we do not explicitly use rees algebras .",
    "interested reader can look at ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 6.5 and 15.8 ) for basic material about rees algebras as well as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) and @xcite for construction of flat families from valuations .",
    "it is also worthwhile to point out the relationship with grbner degenerations . in the grbner basis theory one",
    "degenerates an ideal @xmath84 in a polynomial ring to its initial ideal @xmath85 which then gives a flat degeneration of the scheme @xmath0 defined by @xmath84 to the scheme @xmath86 defined by @xmath85 .",
    "the problem is that even when @xmath84 is a prime ideal , the ideal @xmath85 is usually not radical .",
    "this makes it harder to obtain information about the geometry of @xmath0 from this degeneration . on the other hand , in our construction instead of degenerating the defining relations of @xmath0 ( i.e. the ideal ) , we degenerate a set of generators for the ( homogeneous ) coordinate ring of @xmath0 to their initial terms .",
    "we show that with suitable choices , these initial terms are monomials and define an embedding of the torus @xmath6 into the projective space .",
    "one of the ingredients in the proof of theorem [ th - u - torus - intro ] is the notion of a _ gradient - hamiltonian vector field _ due to ruan ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) as well as section [ sec - grad - hamiltonian ] in this paper ) .",
    "the author learned about this notion in the interesting paper @xcite where the gradient - hamiltonian flow is applied to the gelfand - zetlin toric degeneration of the flag variety .",
    "the symplectomorphism between the torus and an open subset @xmath60 of @xmath0 in theorem [ th - u - torus - intro ] is given by the flow of the gradient - hamiltonian vector field of @xmath17 with respect to the khler structure coming from the embedding @xmath44 .",
    "the toric degenerations usually considered in algebraic geometry literature , have slightly different properties than our degeneration satisfying properties ( a)-(c ) above ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be an irreducible projective variety .",
    "what is usually understood by a toric degeneration of @xmath0 , is a family of varieties @xmath17 , where @xmath3 is a variety and @xmath87 is a morphism , which has the following properties :    * the family is trivial over @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath88 is isomorphic to @xmath89 . in particular ,",
    "each fiber @xmath90 , @xmath47 , is isomorphic to @xmath0 * the special fiber @xmath51 is a projective toric variety . *",
    "all the fibers are irreducible and reduced ( as schemes ) . *",
    "the family @xmath3 is flat over @xmath4 ( this is in fact implied by the previous conditions ) .",
    "suppose the family @xmath3 is sitting in @xmath20 , for some projective space @xmath91 and such that @xmath87 is the restriction of the projection on the second factor .",
    "the conditions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) then give the following : the hilbert polynomial of @xmath92 , as a subvariety of @xmath91 , is independent of @xmath93 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iii , theorem 9.9 ) ) .",
    "let us consider the product khler form on @xmath20 where @xmath91 is equipped with the standard fubini - study khler form and @xmath4 with the standard khler form @xmath94 .",
    "equip ( the smooth locus of ) @xmath3 with a khler structure induced from @xmath20 .",
    "the conditions above in particular tell us that the symplectic volume of all the fibers @xmath92 , including the special fiber @xmath86 , are the same .    in @xcite , motivated by the previous toric degeneration result of @xcite ,",
    "anderson constructs a large class of flat toric degenerations of projective varieties in connection with the theory of newton - okounkov bodies .",
    "the construction depends on a choice of a @xmath21-valued valuation @xmath95 on the field of rational functions on the variety .",
    "a crucial assumption in this construction is that an associated semigroup of lattice points is finitely generated ( the value semigroup of @xmath95 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "given a toric degeneration @xmath3 for a smooth projective variety @xmath0 as above , the authors construct a completely integrable system on @xmath0 by pulling back the toric integrable system on the toric variety @xmath86 ( to do this one needs a compatible khler structure on the family @xmath3 ) . since in general the special fiber @xmath86 is non - smooth , the pull - back integrable system is defined only on an open subset ( in the usual classical topology ) of @xmath0 . the fact that the toric variety @xmath86 has the same symplectic volume as @xmath0 implies that the open subset on @xmath0 where the integrable system is defined is dense .",
    "a main result in @xcite is that the integrable system extends continuously to the whole @xmath0 .",
    "the image of this integrable system is the newton - okounkov body associated to @xmath0 and the valuation @xmath95 ( used in building the toric degeneration ) .",
    "our construction in this paper works in a much more general setting .",
    "here we do not require the technical and restrictive assumption of `` finite generation of the value semigroup '' needed in @xcite .",
    "we note that instead of a projective toric variety , our special fiber @xmath86 is just the torus @xmath6 , and moreover it can have a smaller symplectic volume than that of the original variety @xmath0 .",
    "that is why the toric open subset @xmath60 in theorem [ th - u - torus - intro ] may not be dense in @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless if the special fiber @xmath96 happens to have the same symplectic volume as @xmath0 then @xmath60 is dense in @xmath0 .",
    "these are illustrated in section [ sec - example ] , examples [ ex-1 ] and [ ex-2 ] .",
    "we expect that our results can be generalized to non - smooth projective varieties as well ( here we use smoothness to guarantee that the gradient - hamiltonian flow is defined for all @xmath97 ) .",
    "we believe that the results of this paper open new doors to study symplectic geometry of projective varieties and in particular the notions of gromov width and symplectic packings , and more applications beyond those in section [ sec - gw - packing ] would appear .",
    "in particular , as pointed out by dusa mcduff , the results of the paper may help to give new bounds for the gromov width as well as symplectic packings in several important classes of examples such as abelian surfaces and @xmath98 surfaces .",
    "also they might be useful in other packing problems such as for the symplectic polydisc embeddings ( even in real dim @xmath99 and for square polydiscs @xmath100 not much is known e.g. for general tori @xmath101 or for k3 surfaces ) .    * acknowledgements :",
