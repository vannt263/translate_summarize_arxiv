    "in 2011 , the babar collaboration observed evidences for the spin - singlet bottomonium state @xmath6 in the sequential decays @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "later , the belle collaboration reported the first observation of the spin - singlet bottomonium states @xmath6 and @xmath9 with the significances of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively in the collisions @xmath12 at energies near the @xmath13 resonance , and determined the masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . on the other hand , the mass of the spin - singlet charmonium state",
    "@xmath16 has been updated from time to time since its first observation in the @xmath17 collisions by the r704 collaboration @xcite , the average value listed in the review of particle physics is @xmath18 @xcite . in this article , we study the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses with the tensor currents using the qcd sum rules , and make predictions to be confronted with experimental data .",
    "the qcd sum rules is a powerful theoretical tool in studying the heavy quarkonium states @xcite , and the existing works focus on the @xmath19-wave heavy quarkonium states @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the @xmath24-wave spin - triplet heavy quarkonium states @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , while the works on the @xmath24-wave spin - singlet heavy quarkonium states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are few @xcite , and the interpolating currents @xmath28 are used , @xmath29 , with the prediction @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the heavy quarkonium states play an important role both in studying the interplays between the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd and in understanding the heavy quark dynamics due to the absence of the light quark contaminations .",
    "the @xmath24-wave spin - singlet heavy quarkonium states @xmath31 have the spin - parity - charge - conjunction @xmath32 , the tensor currents @xmath33 without derivatives have the following properties under the parity and charge - conjunction transforms , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we also expect to interpolate the heavy quarkonium states @xmath31 with the axial - vector currents @xmath37 , which have the following properties under the parity and charge - conjunction transforms , @xmath38 the axial - vector currents couple potentially to the axial - vector heavy quarkonium states @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which have the quantum numbers @xmath41 rather than @xmath42 , the tensor currents are superior to the axial - vector currents in studying the @xmath31 . in this article",
    ", we interpolate the singlet heavy quarkonium states @xmath31 with the tensor currents which have no derivatives .    the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules for the masses and decay constants of the heavy quarkonium states @xmath31 in sect.2 ; in sect.3 , we present the numerical results and discussions ; and sect.4 is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "in the following , we write down the two - point correlation functions @xmath43 in the qcd sum rules , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , the two interpolating currents are related with each other through the relation @xmath46 .",
    "we can insert a complete set of intermediate hadronic states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators @xmath47 into the correlation functions @xmath43 to obtain the hadronic representation @xcite . after isolating the ground state contribution from the heavy quarkonium states @xmath31 , we get the following result , @xmath48 where the decay constants @xmath49 are defined by @xmath50 and the @xmath51 are the polarization vectors of the heavy quarkonium states @xmath31 .    we carry out the borel transforms ( and the derivatives ) with respect to the variable @xmath52 to obtain the borel sum rules ( and the moments sum rules ) , and write down the following results at the phenomenological side , @xmath53 where the @xmath54 are the continuum threshold parameters .        in the following ,",
    "we briefly outline the operator product expansion for the correlation functions @xmath43 in perturbative qcd .",
    "we contract the quark fields in the correlation functions @xmath43 with wick theorem firstly : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the @xmath58 is the gell - mann matrix , the @xmath59 , @xmath60 are color indexes , and the @xmath61 is the gluon condensate @xcite , then complete the integrals both in the coordinate space and in the momentum space , finally obtain the correlation functions @xmath43 at the level of the quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , we also calculate the @xmath62 corrections to the perturbative terms .",
    "the typical feynman diagrams we calculate in the operator product expansion are shown in fig.1 .",
    "once analytical expressions of the qcd spectral densities are obtained , then we can take the quark - hadron duality and perform the borel transforms ( and the derivatives ) with respect to the variable @xmath52 to obtain the borel sum rules ( and the moments sum rules ) : @xmath63\\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{t^2}\\right ) \\",
