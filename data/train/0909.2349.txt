    "the excitation of nucleon resonances in electromagnetic interactions has long been recognized as an important source of information to understand the strong interaction in the domain of quark confinement .",
    "the clas detector at jefferson lab is the first large acceptance instrument designed for the comprehensive investigation of exclusive electroproduction of mesons with the goal to study the electroexcitation of nucleon resonances in detail . in recent years",
    ", a variety of measurements of single pion electroproduction on protons , including polarization measurements , have been performed at clas in a wide range of photon virtuality @xmath4 from 0.16 to 6 gev@xmath8 @xcite . in this work we present the results on the electroexcitation of the resonances @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , obtained from the comprehensive analysis of these data .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations of the electroexcitation of nucleon resonances have a long history , and along with the hadron masses and nucleon electromagnetic characteristics , the information on the @xmath14 transitions played an important role in the justification of the quark model .",
    "however , the picture of the nucleon and its excited states , which at first seemed quite simple and was identified as a model of non - relativistic constituent quarks , turned out to be more complex .",
    "one of the reasons for this was the realization that quarks are relativistic objects .",
    "a consistent way to perform the relativistic treatment of the @xmath15 transitions is to consider them in the light - front ( lf ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "the relevant approaches were developed and used to describe the nucleon and its excited states @xcite .",
    "however , much more effort is required to obtain a better understanding of what are the @xmath16 and @xmath17 lf wave functions and what is their connection to the inter - quark forces and to the qcd confining mechanism .",
    "another reason is connected with the realization that the traditional picture of baryons built from three constituent quarks is an oversimplified approximation . in the case of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 , the mass ordering of these states , the large total width of @xmath1 , and the substantial coupling of @xmath3 to the @xmath10 channel @xcite and to strange particles @xcite , are indicative of posible additional @xmath18 components in the wave functions of these states @xcite and ( or ) of alternative descriptions . within dynamical reaction models",
    "@xcite , the meson - cloud contribution is identified as a source of the long - standing discrepancy between the data and constituent quark model predictions for the @xmath19 magnetic - dipole amplitude .",
    "the importance of pion ( cloud ) contributions to the transition form factors has also been confirmed by the lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "alternative descriptions include the representation of @xmath1 as a gluonic baryon excitation @xcite and the possibility that nucleon resonances are meson - baryon molecules generated in chiral coupled - channel dynamics @xcite .",
    "relations between baryon electromagnetic form factors and generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) have also been formulated that connect these two different notions to describe the baryon structure @xcite .",
    "the improvement in accuracy and reliability of the information on the electroexcitation of the nucleon s excited states over a large range in photon virtuality @xmath4 is very important for the progress in our understanding of this complex picture of the strong interaction in the domain of quark confinement .",
    "our goal is to determine in detail the @xmath4-behavior of the electroexcitation of resonances .",
    "for this reason , we analyse the data at each @xmath4 point separately without imposing any constraints on the @xmath4 dependence of the electroexcitation amplitudes .",
    "this is in contrast with the analyses by maid , for instance maid2007 @xcite , where the electroexcitation amplitudes are in part constrained by using parameterizations for their @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the analysis was performed using two approaches , fixed-@xmath6 dispersion relations ( dr ) and the unitary isobar model ( uim ) .",
    "the real parts of the amplitudes , which contain a significant part of the non - resonant contributions , are built in these approaches in conceptually different ways .",
    "this allows us to draw conclusions on the model sensitivity of the resulting electroexcitation amplitudes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the data and discuss the stages of the analysis .",
    "the approaches we use to analyse the data , dr and uim , were successfully employed in analyses of pion - photoproduction and low-@xmath4-electroproduction data , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "iii we therefore discuss only the points that need different treatment when we move from low @xmath4 to high @xmath4 .",
    "uncertainties of the background contributions related to the pion and nucleon elastic form factors , and to @xmath20 transition form factors are discussed in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we present how resonance contributions are taken into account and explain how the uncertainties associated with higher resonances and with the uncertainties of masses and widths of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are accounted for . all these uncertainties are included in the total model uncertainty of the final results .",
    "so , in addition to the uncertainties in the data , we have accounted for , as much as possible , the model uncertainties of the extracted @xmath21 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 amplitudes .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "vi , compared with model predictions in sec .",
    "vii , and summarized in sec .",
    "the data are presented in tables [ pol_data]-[pi0_data ] .",
    "they cover the first , second , and part of the third resonance regions .",
    "the stages of our analysis are dictated by how we evaluate the influence of higher resonances on the extracted amplitudes for the @xmath0 and for the resonances from the second resonance region .    in the first stage ,",
    "we analyse the data reported in table [ pol_data ] ( @xmath22gev@xmath8 ) where the richest set of polarization measurements is available .",
    "the results based on the analysis of the cross sections and longitudinally polarized beam asymmetries ( @xmath23 ) at @xmath24 and @xmath25gev@xmath8 were already presented in refs .",
    "however , recently , new data have become available from the jlab - clas measurements of longitudinal target ( @xmath26 ) and beam - target ( @xmath27 ) asymmetries for @xmath28 at @xmath29 gev@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we performed a new analysis on the same data set , including these new measurements .",
    "we also extended our analysis to the available data for the close values of @xmath30 and @xmath31gev@xmath8 .",
    "as the asymmetries @xmath32 have relatively weak @xmath4 dependences , the data on asymmetries at nearby @xmath4 were also included in the corresponding sets at @xmath30 and @xmath31gev@xmath8 .",
    "following our previous analyses @xcite , we have complemented the data set at @xmath33gev@xmath8 with the desy @xmath34 cross sections data @xcite , since the corresponding clas data extend over a restricted range in @xmath35 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis of data at @xmath33gev@xmath8 was performed in combination with jlab - clas data for double - pion electroproduction off the proton @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to get information on the electroexcitation amplitudes for the resonances from the third resonance region .",
    "this information , combined with the @xmath36 amplitudes known from photoproduction data @xcite , sets the ranges of the higher resonance contributions when we extract the amplitudes of the @xmath37 @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 transitions from the data reported in table [ pol_data ] .    in the next step ,",
    "we analyse the data from table [ pip_data ] which present a large body of @xmath38 differential cross sections and longitudinally polarized electron beam asymmetries at large @xmath39gev@xmath8 @xcite . as the isospin @xmath40 nucleon resonances couple more strongly to the @xmath41 channel",
    ", these data provide large sensitivity to the electrocouplings of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 states . until recently",
    ", the information on the electroexcitation of these resonances at @xmath42gev@xmath8 was based almost exclusively on the ( unpublished ) desy data @xcite on @xmath43 ( @xmath44 and @xmath45gev@xmath8 ) which have very limited angular coverage .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath46 final state is coupled more weakly to the isospin @xmath40 states , and is dominated by the nearby isospin @xmath47 @xmath0 resonance . for the @xmath3 , which has a large branching ratio to the @xmath10 channel , there is also information on the @xmath48 transverse helicity amplitude found from the data on @xmath11 electroproduction off the proton @xcite .    in the range of @xmath4 covered by the data @xcite ( table [ pip_data ] )",
    ", there is no information on the helicity amplitudes for the resonances from the third resonance region .",
    "the data @xcite cover only part of this region and do not allow us to extract reliably the corresponding amplitudes ( except those for @xmath49 ) .",
    "for the @xmath50 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 amplitudes extracted from the data @xcite , the evaluation of the uncertainties caused by the lack of information on the resonances from the third resonance region is described in sec .",
    "v.    finally , we extract the @xmath51 amplitudes from the data reported in tables [ smith ] and [ pi0_data ] .",
    "these are low @xmath4 data for @xmath52 and @xmath34 electroproduction differential cross sections @xcite and data for @xmath52 electroproduction differential cross sections at @xmath53gev@xmath8 @xcite and @xmath54gev@xmath8 @xcite . in the analysis of these data ,",
    "the influence of higher resonances on the results for the @xmath0 was evaluated by employing the spread of the @xmath55 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 amplitudes obtained in the previous stages of our analysis of the data from tables [ pol_data ] and [ pip_data ] .",
    "although the data for @xmath56gev@xmath8 ( table [ pi0_data ] ) cover a wide range in @xmath35 , the absence of @xmath34 electroproduction data for these @xmath4 , except @xmath57gev@xmath8 , does not allow us to extract the amplitudes for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonances with model uncertainties comparable to those for the amplitudes found from the data of tables [ pol_data ] and [ pip_data ] . for @xmath58gev@xmath8",
    ", there are desy @xmath34 electroproduction data @xcite , which cover the second and third resonance regions , allowing us to extract amplitudes for all resonances from the first and second resonance regions at @xmath59gev@xmath8 . to evaluate the uncertainties caused by the higher mass resonances , we have used for @xmath59gev@xmath8 the same procedure as for the data from table [ pip_data ] .",

    "iii . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in constituent quark models , the nonzero magnitude of @xmath61 can arise only due to a deformation of the @xmath62 spherical symmetry in the n and ( or ) @xmath63 wave functions . in this connection it is interesting that both dynamical models @xcite give practically zero ` bare ' values for @xmath64 ( as well as for @xmath65 ) .",
    "the entire @xmath61 amplitude in these models is due to the quadrupole deformation that arises through the interaction of the photon with the meson cloud .",
