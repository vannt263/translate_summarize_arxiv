    "it is now well - known that the potts model @xcite possesses a duality relation in two dimensions .",
    "in fact , it is using this duality relation that potts @xcite first determined the transition temperature for the square lattice .",
    "the purpose of this note is to point out a self - dual relation of the potts model in one dimension , a curious and somewhat surprising result which appears to have escaped heretofore attention . for the ising model",
    "this duality implies a new circle theorem .",
    "consider @xmath1 potts spins placed on a ring interacting with nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath2 and an external field @xmath3 for one specific spin state .",
    "number the sites by @xmath4 and denote the spin state at site @xmath5 by @xmath6 .",
    "the partition function is z_n(q;k ,",
    "l ) = _ _ i= 1^q _ i=1^n t(_i , _",
    "i+1 ) [ partition ] with @xmath7 and t(_i , _",
    "i+1 ) = exp[k_kr(_i,_i+1 ) ] [ l_kr(_i,1 ) ] , [ tmatrix ] where @xmath8 is the kronecker delta function . in ensuing discussions",
    "we shall make use of the fact that , due to symmetry , the partition function ( [ partition ] ) is the same if the external field is applied to any spin state , namely , if @xmath9 in ( [ tmatrix ] ) is replaced by @xmath10 for any @xmath11 .    regarding @xmath12 as the elements of a @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 , then the partition function ( [ partition ] ) can be evaluated by the standard technique of the transfer matrix .",
    "the characteristic equation for @xmath14 is ||=0.[char ] this equation can be factorized @xcite leading to eigenvalues @xmath15 , which is @xmath16-fold degenerate , and @xmath17 , which are the two roots of the quadratic equation ^2 -(e^k+l + e^k + q-2 ) +e^l(e^k-1)(e^k+q-1 ) = 0 .",
    "[ lambda ] this gives rise to the following explicit expression for the partition function , z_n(q;k , l ) = _+^n + _-^n + ( q-2)(e^k-1)^n . [ partition1 ] explicitly , we have _=12 . [ root ]",
    "note that terms involving branch cuts are cancelled in expanding ( [ partition1 ] ) , and as a consequence @xmath18 is indeed a polynomial in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "our main result is the self - dual relation for the partition function ( [ partition1 ] ) ^-n/2 = [ ( e^k^*-1 ) ( e^l^*-1)]^-n/2 , [ duality ] where the dual variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 are related to @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively , by ( e^k^*-1 ) ( e^l-1 ) = q , ( e^l^*-1 ) ( e^k-1 ) = q. [ dualvariable ] the validity of ( [ duality ] ) can be explicitly verified using ( [ partition1 ] ) for @xmath23 and for specific values of @xmath24 .",
    "but its validity for general @xmath25 and @xmath1 is not very obvious by looking at the solution .    to establish ( [ duality ] ) for general @xmath25 and @xmath1",
    ", we construct a lattice @xmath0 of @xmath26 sites as shown in fig . 1 , by introducing an extra ( ghost ) spin interacting with all @xmath1 sites with an equal interaction @xmath3 .",
    "note that the lattice is planar and self - dual .",
    "namely , if one places dual spins , one in each _ face _ of @xmath0 including the face exterior to @xmath0 , and connects dual spins with edges crossing each of the edges of @xmath0 , one arrives at a lattice which is precisely @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the partition function of the potts model on @xmath0 .",
    "following the remark after ( [ tmatrix ] ) , one has the identity z_l(q;k , l ) = q z_n(q;k , l ) .",
    "[ ghost ] it is then sufficient to show that ( [ duality ] ) holds for @xmath28 .    generally , the potts model possesses a duality relation for any planar lattice , or graph , with arbitrary edge - dependent interactions @xcite .",
    "let @xmath29 be the partition function of the potts model on a planar graph of @xmath30 sites with edge - dependent interactions @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the partition function of the dual model .",
    "then , the duality relation given in @xcite can be written as = q^-m_d/2z^(d)(k^*_ij ) , [ duality1 ] where @xmath33 is the number of sites of the dual graph and ( e^k_ij-1)(e^k^*_ij-1)=q . now the lattice is self - dual , namely , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the application of ( [ duality1 ] ) to now leads to an expression which is precisely ( [ duality ] ) with @xmath36 in place of @xmath37 .",
    "the duality relation ( [ duality ] ) now follows after introducing ( [ ghost ] ) .",
    "the zeroes of the partition function can be computed from _+^n + _-^n + ( q-2 ) ( e^k-1)^n = 0 , [ zero ] at least numerically , for any given @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis is particularly simple if the three terms in ( [ zero ] ) coalesce into two . for the @xmath23 ising model , for example ,",
    "one finds zeroes located at _+ = e^i(2n+1)/n _- , n=0,1,2,,n-1 .",
    "[ isingzero ] this leads to the yang - lee circle @xcite in the complex @xmath38 plane for @xmath39 .",
    "for the zero - field potts model , @xmath40 , one has @xmath41 and finds from ( [ zero ] ) the zeroes at e^k+q-1 = ( 1-q)^1/n ( e^k-1 ) , n=0,1,2,,n-1 .",
    "[ isingzero1 ] in the limit of @xmath42 , the partition function ( [ partition1 ] ) is dominated by the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude .",
    "it follows that the zeroes lie continuously on the loci @xmath43 generalizing a previous result @xcite for real @xmath25 and @xmath40 . here",
    ", the loci ( [ isingzero1 ] ) and ( [ locus ] ) apply to real and complex @xmath44 .",
    "particularly , for @xmath45 , @xmath18 gives the ground state entropy of the antiferromagnetic potts model and the chromatic polynomial ( in @xmath25 ) of a ring . in this case",
    "we have @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and we find the zeroes on the circle    been reported by shrock and tsai @xcite",
    ".    for the ising model the duality relation ( [ duality ] ) provides some further implications on the partition function zeroes . to conform with usual notations , we consider @xmath1 ising spins on a ring with nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath48 and an external magnetic field @xmath49 .",
    "the ising partition function is z_ising(k_i , l_i ) = _ _ i=1 _ i=1^n [ e^k_i_i_i+1e^l_i _ i ] .",
    "[ isingp ] using the identity @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we relate @xmath52 to the 2-state potts partition function via z_ising(k_i , l_i ) = e^-n(l_i + k_i ) z_n(2;2k_i , 2l_i).[relation ] thus , after substituting ( [ relation ] ) into ( [ duality ] ) and some re - arrangement , we obtain the following self - dual relation for the ising model on @xmath0 , = z_ising(k_i^*,l_i^ * ) , [ isingd ] where the dual variables are e^-2k_i^ * = l_i , e^-2l_i^ * = k_i .",
    "we note the resemblance of ( [ isingd ] ) with the duality relation of the ising model formulated by syozi @xcite .    from the yang - lee circle theorem",
    "@xcite we know that , for @xmath53 , zeroes of @xmath54 lie on the unit circle in the complex field @xmath55 plane .",
    "now , since we have @xmath56 , the duality relation ( [ isingd ] ) implies that zeroes of @xmath54 lie also on the unit circle in the complex temperature @xmath57 plane , a result which holds for _ any _ @xmath49 and which is not readily recognized otherwise .",
    "a consequence of this is that zeroes of @xmath54 lie on the pure imaginary axis in the @xmath58 plane , generalizing a result previously known only for @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "our circle theorem contrasts with the square lattice result , valid only in the thermodynamic limit and in zero field , which states that in the complex @xmath60 plane zeroes of the partition function @xmath61 lie on two circles of radius @xmath62 and centered at @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "_ note added _ : after the completion of this manuscript , it has been pointed out to me that results similar to those described here have been reported previously @xcite . the duality relation ( [ duality ] ) , which is derived in this manuscript from a graphical consideration ,",
