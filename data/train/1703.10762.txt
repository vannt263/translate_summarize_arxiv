    ", @xmath29 stays fixed , and the system is subject to the thermal bath @xmath5 only ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the virtual particle simultaneously experiences two thermal noises from directions parallel to the @xmath28 and @xmath29 axes , respectively , as noises are depicted by the wavy arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]c . in this work ,",
    "most results are presented on the @xmath37 plane , and the dynamics of each @xmath19 is influenced explicitly by both thermal noises .",
    "the above observation shows that on average , the virtual particle rotates about the origin in the @xmath37 phase space , while its brownian - motion signature is revealed within short - time intervals .",
    "the average circulating behavior shows periodic oscillations in @xmath7 and @xmath8 with an identical frequency and a constant phase difference .",
    "the system therefore acts like a mini electricity generator powered solely by the temperature difference , and thus can be compared to a brownian ratchet or a mini heat engine .",
    "the ac voltage could be conceivably used to power up devices or rectified to store electric energy .",
    "how does energy transfer from the hot heat reservoir to the cold one in a directed cycle ?",
    "first we note that if the virtual particle circulates along some closed loop on the @xmath37 diagram , the amount of energy flowing into the circuit through resistor @xmath54 ( the same as the amount of heat flowing out of the heat bath coupled to @xmath54 ) during one cycle is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the current through @xmath54 .",
    "one can find @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and their magnitude is proportional to the loop area @xmath59 on the @xmath37 diagram .",
    "thus over each counterclockwise cycle @xmath60 , and a net energy is flowing from the hot reservoir towards the cold one .",
    "the energy transfer can be better understood using fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]a as a schematic example . the cyclic diagram is constituted by four simple paths ( i , ii , iii , iv ) , which form a parallelogram with endpoints a , b , c , and d. the four paths are chosen such that @xmath28 stays fixed during i and iii while @xmath29 stays fixed during ii and iv . as a consequence , for processes i and iii",
    ", no currents are flowing through @xmath3 , and the system can be considered adiabatic to the cold reservoir @xmath5 , while it can exchange energy with the hot reservoir @xmath6 . similarly , for processes ii and iv , @xmath61 , and",
    "the system can be considered adiabatic to the @xmath6 bath , while it can exchange energy with the @xmath5 reservoir .",
    "one can show that during processes i and iii , the resistor @xmath4 is exerting positive work on capacitors @xmath62 and @xmath63 , while the bridging capacitor @xmath2 is discharging and also releasing energy into the other capacitors . and during processes ii and iv , the capacitors @xmath62 and @xmath63 are discharging and releasing energy into @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the directions of net energy flows and electric currents are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]b .",
    "other than the reversed polarity in charges and currents , the processes iii and iv simply repeat i and ii , respectively . after a full cycle",
    ", the system resumes its original state , and a net energy is transferred from the @xmath6 to the @xmath5 heat bath through the circuit elements .",
    "the amount of transferred energy can be characterized via the enclosed area of the cycle , as larger cycles and faster gyrating rates signify higher heat conduction rates .",
    "note that for a parallelogram of the aforementioned semi - adiabatic processes without centering at the origin , the magnitude and even the sign of transported energy to and from the capacitors for each individual process may vary .",
    "yet the total amount of energy transported in the two processes i and iii remains unchanged ( and so on for ii and iv ) . as a result",
    ", the energy transfer can be characterized in terms of area on the @xmath37 plot .",
    "furthermore , one can dissect any closed cycle ( e.g. the elliptical contour in our experimental observation in a ness ) into infinite pavements of parallelograms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figure3]c for an illustrated example ) .",
    "thus any closed cycle can be treated as a composite of semi - adiabatic processes .",
    "the linear coupled circuit described here does not convert any heat into work .",
    "therefore , although the gyrating behavior is observed in our system , currently it remains meaningless to discuss about its efficiency and output power .",
    "nonetheless , we can briefly remark on the possibility of extracting work from the system .",
    "for all our discussed cases , the average entropy of this stochastic system ( up to addition by some constant owing to @xmath42 is not a dimensionless quantity ) is @xmath64 ^ 2 } \\right\\}$ ] ( see methods ) .",
    "furthermore , the average internal energy is @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , for the ness case we consider , where the circuit is thermalized by two different heat baths at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , its average energy is identical with that in thermal equilibrium with the mean temperature @xmath66 . on the other hand , one can easily show that the ness average entropy is less than the equilibrium result at the average temperature , suggesting that the circuit in a ness is more ordered . since in thermal equilibrium , entropy is a monotonic function of energy , thus in principle , the circuit in a ness should be capable of providing work via some relaxation process towards the equilibrium where the system entropy is preserved .",
    "note that with proper external driving , this linear system can function as a heat engine or a refrigerator @xcite .",
    "the main results of this work are visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "first , we present the equipotential lines of @xmath38 as white concentric elliptical contours in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure2 ] . due to the presence of a nonzero @xmath2",
    ", the potential possesses no rotational symmetry , and the principle axes of the contours are tilted in the @xmath37 frame and do not coincide with @xmath39 axes .",
    "therefore , this setup meets the two aforementioned requirements and can serve as an electrical version of brownian gyrator @xcite .",
    "our measured steady state distribution @xmath40 is presented as a colormap plot in figs .",
    "[ fig : figure2]a and  [ fig : figure2]b . at thermal equilibrium ( @xmath41 )",
    ", @xmath42 follows the boltzmann distribution .",
    "thus @xmath42 is constant on equipotential contours , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]a .",
    "the system relaxes into a ness when @xmath43 with a nonzero heat flow on average going steadily from the @xmath6 heat bath to the @xmath5 heat bath through the circuit ( see methods for evaluating heat conduction ) . in a ness , however , @xmath42 does not stay in accordance with the potential landscape , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b for the case of @xmath44 120 k. while @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b still has an elliptic shape , its principle axes rotate counterclockwise slightly when compared with that in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure2]a .",
    "this behavior is attributed to the narrower distribution in @xmath7 in our ness case due to the lower @xmath5 .",
    "a major difference between thermal equilibrium and ness lies in time reversibility .",
    "theoretically , the former is achieved through the detailed balance condition , which is itself a signature of time reversibility . on the other hand",
    ", the detailed balance condition can fail in a nonequilibrium process , leading to persistent probability flows even in its steady state . here",
    "we evaluate the probability flux @xmath45 from the experimental trajectroy of the virtual particle , where @xmath46 represents the steady - state flow velocity at @xmath47 [ 17 ] .",
    "( see methods for the defination of @xmath48 . )",
    "the experimental result of @xmath49 are presented as vector fields in figs .",
    "[ fig : figure2](a ) and .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b",
    ". there is clearly a circulating probability flux field in the ness case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b ) , while no significant flow occurs in the thermal equilibrium case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]a ) . therefore , in a ness , the motion of the virtual particle can be depicted by brownian dynamics with an average counterclockwise circulation , i.e. , it manifests as a brownian gyrator in an electrical system .",
    "the circulation of probability flux in the ness results from the unbalanced competition between the conservative and diffusive driving forces . navely speaking , on the @xmath37 plane , the conservative force pulls the virtual particle inward .",
    "meanwhile , the diffusive force results from gradient changes of @xmath42 and tends to push the virtual particle outward . at thermal equilibrium ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figure2]a ) , the two sets of contour lines have identical shape , and their representative forces cancel out exactly . thus the net flux is zero everywhere , a signature of the detailed balance . in the ness case , however , due to the temperature difference , the principle axes for the contours of @xmath42 and @xmath38 are different , and the two driving forces are mostly not balanced . as a result , the net force contributes to a non - vanishing flux .",
    "circulating motion therefore emerges naturally since the flux at the steady state must be divergence - free ( the curl of a nonzero field must exist somewhere for the divergence - free case ) .",
    "note that this directonal circulation motion requires no nonlinear rectification like the feynman ratchet ; this system is completely linear .",
    "moreover , owing to the conservation of probability , @xmath50 holds along the steady - state circulation trajectories . since @xmath51 , @xmath48 and",
    "thus @xmath49 must be perpendicular to @xmath52 ( a rigorous proof is provided in theoretical analysis ) .",
    "this feature is also confirmed in our experiment , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b .",
    "the results for the curl of the steady - state flux , @xmath53 , are shown in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] , where @xmath53 points out of the @xmath37 plane . in the ness case",
    "( see the inset of b and c ) , the large positive curling trend near the origin causes the virtual particle to gyrate counterclockwise on average .",
    "note that away from the origin , small regions with a negative curling direction ( shown as dark blue ) can be observed from both our experimental and theoretical analysis .",
    "negative curl exists in regions of approximately parallel field lines whose magnitude decreases as the virtual particle marches outward .",
    "note that even in the negative curl regions , the flux field lines still follow the counterclockwise gyrating trend with respect to the origin .",
    "the gyrating motion can also be well visualized through the time trace of @xmath67 , the angle between @xmath47 and the horizontal axis in the @xmath37 plane . fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4]a presents the gross behavior of @xmath68 for various @xmath5 , while its stochastic behavior is exemplified in the inset . in the ness cases ( @xmath43 ) ,",

    "<S> * heat engines based on microscopic working substances with few degrees of freedom , exhibiting remarkable efficiencies accompanied with noticeable stochastic behaviors due to brownian motions , are of great interests for both demand of energy harvesting and development of microscopic ( stochastic ) thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> although autonomous brownian engines are always competitive candidates for energy harvesting given that no external controls are required , an autonomous brownian ratchet , a thought perpetual - motion machine proposed by feynman , has never been demonstrated near room temperature scale owing to the fact that it remains a great challenge to couple a microscopic object to two different heat baths . </S>",
    "<S> here we report an experimental and theoretical investigation of an electrical version of an autonomous brownian ratchet truly relied on real heat baths . </S>",
    "<S> the ratchet is manifested via two resistor - capacitor circuits coupled through a third capacitor and the two resistors are subject to thermal noises of different temperatures . while the voltage fluctuations across each resistor can be compared to a one - dimensional confined brownian motion , their collective dynamics exhibits an average gyrating motion around the potential minimum owing to the lack of detailed balance in a nonequilibrium steady state caused by the temperature difference of the two thermal baths . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment and analysis clearly demonstrate an autonomous brownian motor in a linear system , and affirms the general principle and the possibility of a brownian ratchet working near room temperature scale . </S>",
    "<S> *    increasing of capabilities to manufacture and control small - scale systems together with the discovery of remarkable energy - conversion efficiencies achieved by bio - molecular machines has driven a rapidly growing interest in the development of miniature thermal machines . </S>",
    "<S> recent advances for energy harvest in artificial micro- and nanoscale systems undergoing significant thermal fluctuations are being put to the test @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , realizations of miniature heat engines , featuring a brownian particle in an optical trap , are reported in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while these miniature machines require external controls to perform cyclic motions , another promising direction is targeted at autonomous brownian devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples include an on - chip microscale device to convert joule heating to mechanical oscillation @xcite and an on - chip autonomous maxwell s demon for refrigeration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as suggested by feynman @xcite , an autonomous stochastic heat engine can be facilitated through the simultaneous contacts to two different heat baths although the efficiency can not reach the carnot limit due to the built - in nature of irreversibility in such a thought device @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea has been experimentally realized in a rotational ratchet with an hot bath provided by a granular gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other versions of autonomous motors are tested experimentally in mechanical @xcite and electrical @xcite systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , huge thermal noises generated artificially are demanded to show stochastic behaviors . building an autonomous brownian ratchet truly relied on real heat baths remains a great challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> brownian gyrators are naturally candidates for the realization of stochastic heat engines for it has been demonstrated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that autonomous circulating behavior can emerge for stochastic systems in nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) . a `` minimal '' version of brownian gyrator has been proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which a structureless particle is confined near the center of a harmonic potential in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) space , and is permanently in contact with two different heat baths . </S>",
    "<S> the particle undergoing brownian motion can exhibit an average gyrating motion around the potential minimum if two requirements are met : ( 1 ) the potential is not rotationally symmetric , and ( 2 ) the directions of the two random forces , derived from their corresponding heat baths , do not coincide with the principal axes of the potential contours . having gyrating behavior in this linear brownian system is conceptually simple ; however , technically it is tremendously difficult to implement a minuscule in touch with two independent heat baths simultaneously @xcite .    in this work , we report both experimental and theoretical studies on the stochastic dynamics of a capacitively - coupled resistor - capacitor ( _ rc _ ) circuit as illustrated in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : figure1]a , where the resistors are agitated by thermal noises of two different temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this linear system can be compared exactly to a minimal brownian gyrator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the existing studies on this system concerning its entropy fluctuation and the applicability of fluctuation theorems @xcite , we pay attention to its gyrating behavior concealed in its fluctuating dynamics in the configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> while the voltage for each of the electrical element fluctuates due to thermal noises , heat can be conducted from the hot to the cold reservoir via the circuit , leading to an averaged unidirectional gyrating motion . </S>"
