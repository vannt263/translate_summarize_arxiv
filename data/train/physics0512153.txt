    "zeus is one of two detectors accumulating data from electron - proton beam collisions at the hera accelerator operated by the desy laboratory in hamburg , germany .",
    "analyses of such data have provided quantitative values of cross sections and derivative information related to the proton s quark and gluon content , quantum chromodynamics , and other issues relevant to the standard model and beyond . in september 2000",
    ", hera completed an eight year running period ( hera - i ) , which provided measurements of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , photoproduction , and other processes in a newly accessible kinematic regime .",
    "hera underwent a luminosity upgrade in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the goal was to increase the hera - i peak luminosity by a factor of 5 .",
    "in addition to the accelerator modifications necessary to achieve this , spin rotators were installed to provide electron beam longitudinal polarization of about @xmath0 on average . a new physics program ( hera - ii ) began in 2002 to make accurate measurements of small cross sections with polarized beams .",
    "precise knowledge of the luminosity is required for precise determination of a cross section associated with any process ; such measurements depend on luminosity integrated over time , @xmath1 , to normalize the numbers of events observed during the same time period .",
    "luminosity had been measured @xcite in hera - i using the rate of high energy photons from the bremsstrahlung process , @xmath2 , produced by the colliding beams .",
    "this process is well understood , has a high rate and an accurately calculable cross section . produced photons",
    "follow the direction of the colliding beam electrons and are observed about 100  m downstream , after the electron and proton beams have been magnetically separated .",
    "the zeus hera - i technique , with a calorimeter to directly measure all bremsstrahlung photons faces new difficulties at hera - ii , including the following :    * a significant increase in direct synchrotron radiation ( sr ) flux from the electron beam occurs due to the higher beam currents and to a new beam focusing scheme to optimize high luminosity near the interaction region . * much larger numbers of overlaid bremsstrahlung events ( pile - up ) occur . colliding bunches producing more than one photon",
    "are not separated in the calorimeter technique .",
    "hera - ii luminosity implies a significant probability ( approaching unity ) for several final state photons with @xmath3  gev in each bunch - crossing .",
    "* there are additional requirements for accurate cross sections using polarized beam electrons ( or positrons ) .",
    "the hera beams each consist of 220 bunches separated by 96  ns .",
    "a few bunches are unfilled ; the empty bunches are used for monitoring purposes and they are also needed for the proton beam abort system , and the unpaired bunches are used to measure small backgrounds resulting from the electron or proton beam interacting with residual gas near the intersection region . after acceleration , the polarization of the electron beam @xcite rises from @xmath4 to @xmath5 over a period of about @xmath6 minutes and the beam polarization might be different for each bunch .",
    "therefore , the luminosity must be measured accurately for @xmath7 bunch over time intervals much less than @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , a fast luminosity measurement is essential for obtaining collisions , and monitoring and optimizing luminosity during a fill .",
    "the required accuracy in the luminosity measurement for hera - ii is @xmath9 , which is similar to the most accurate luminosity measurement achieved at hera - i .",
    "the luminosity spectrometer described in this paper utilizes a new method of measuring luminosity at zeus which addresses the new problems of synchrotron flux , pile - up , and other requirements , while meeting the specifications for luminosity accuracy required by zeus physics goals .    in the spectrometer system",
    ", the bremsstrahlung photons are detected through their well understood pair conversion , @xmath10 , in material of a beam - pipe exit window well downstream of the interaction region where these photons have been spatially separated from the circulating beams . after the converted electron pair has been spatially split by the magnetic field of a dipole magnet , the particles",
    "are individually detected by two small electromagnetic calorimeters placed at transverse distances separated from the direct synchrotron radiation and unconverted bremsstrahlung beams .",
    "the observed rate of converted photons is proportional to the luminosity , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : luminosity_calculation ] .",
    "this setup reduces dramatically the requirements on data rate for the spectrometer calorimeters , since the primary photon beam bypasses them and the magnet insures that the large flux of low energy electrons from synchrotron photon conversions in material upstream of the magnet are swept away from the detectors . due to the small conversion fraction ( @xmath11 ) in the window and",
    "the limited accepted energy range , the pile - up problem is reduced by two orders of magnitude , so that multiple observed photons constitute only a few percent of the rate even at the highest luminosities expected for hera - ii .    with the relaxed rate requirements on the spectrometer calorimeters , their design can be sophisticated enough to simultaneously provide relatively precise measurements of the converted electron energies and positions  in turn giving similarly precise information for the bremsstrahlung photon .",
    "the redundancy and precision of the measurements provide important assurance on many aspects of the acceptance which must be known accurately with this technique . in general ,",
    "the technique is simple and accurate , and works well at high luminosities .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in sec .  [",
    "sec : spectrometer_design_and_components ] are presented the details of the design of the luminosity spectrometer , including the calorimeter modules and a brief description of the data acquisition system .",
    "the detector calibration in a momentum analyzed electron test beam , and the reconstruction of photon properties from the calorimeter measurements are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : calorimeter_reconstruction_of_electrons_and_photon ] .",
    "the method of calculating the luminosity is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : luminosity_calculation ] , and the @xmath12 @xmath13 calibration and operating performance during the first months of hera - ii operation are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : system_operation ] .",
    "a schematic layout of the spectrometer system is shown in fig .  [ fig:2 - 1-layout ] .",
    "the coordinate system is defined with the positive @xmath14-axis along the photon beam direction , @xmath15 pointing upwards and @xmath16 along the line away from the center of the hera ring . here",
    "we describe each component in the order encountered by a photon , beginning at the exit window of the photon beam pipe , through the collimators , magnet , and the calorimeters .",
    "relevant aspects of the data acquisition system are also described .     nominal interaction point .",
    "the origin for the transverse coordinates ( @xmath16 , @xmath15 ) was chosen at the center of the exit window.,width=453 ]    the bremsstrahlung photons from the intersection region travel through a long vacuum pipe terminating at an exit window , at 92  m from the nominal intersection point ( ip ) .",
    "upstream of the window inside the vacuum chamber ( not shown in fig .  [ fig:2 - 1-layout ] ) are various aperture restrictions such as collimators , magnets , and other apparatus .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 - 2-aperture ] shows the picture of a foil sensitive to synchrotron radiation , which was located in the beamline near the front face of the calorimeters .",
    "the foil clearly indicates the aperture delimited by upstream obstacles . for scale , the maximum horizontal extent of the aperture is 9  cm .",
    "the maximum vertical limits are representative of the 7  cm aperture of the fixed collimator .",
    "the window , at the upstream end of the spectrometer system , terminates the vacuum so that the remainder of the detection system is in air .",
    "approximately @xmath17 of the photons convert into @xmath18 pairs in the window .",
    "the typical energy of photons of interest is about @xmath19  gev .",
    "the distributions in @xmath16 and @xmath15 photon impact positions at the window within the acceptance region reflect primarily the angular divergence of the primary beam electrons as they collide in the upstream zeus interaction region .",
    "the converted electron pairs that successfully traverse subsequent collimators closely follow the original photon direction , until they encounter the magnetic dipole where they are split vertically .",
    "the magnetic field is such that a typical 10  gev electron ( positron ) will then travel in the @xmath20 directions with a vertical angle of about @xmath21 rad , and encounter the calorimeters , whose vertical midpoints are displaced approximately @xmath22  cm from the incident photon beam .",
    "the calorimeter modules permit measurements of the electrons @xmath16 and @xmath15 positions with resolution of about 1.0 mm , and energies with resolution of about @xmath23 at 10  gev .",
    "calibrations in an electron test beam ( described in sec .",
    "[ sec : calorimeter_reconstruction_of_electrons_and_photon ] ) and in operation with the spectrometer ( described in sec .",
    "[ sec : system_operation ] ) verify these calorimeter measurement precisions .    events with electrons detected in both calorimeter modules are used to reconstruct the original photon s energy and transverse coordinates .",
    "the measured coincidence rate permits calculation of luminosity , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : luminosity_calculation ] .",
    "the bremsstrahlung position distributions , while relevant to luminosity calculations , also provide a diagnostic of the interaction region for hera operation .",
    "the locations of the different spectrometer elements were obtained from optical survey and verified with beam data .",
    "transverse distances are known to a precision of order 1 mm while the dimensions along the direction of the beam are known with a precision of better than 1  cm .",
    "these accuracies satisfy the requirements for the luminosity measurement .",
    "the composition of the exit window is shown in tab .  1 :    .components of the exit window , as measured by mass spectroscopy .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : uncertainties ]    the shape of the aperture and its alignment relative to the detectors were each measured to an accuracy of 1 mm .",
    "the effects of gain drifts could cause a shift in @xmath24 measurement of 2 mm . to check the effect on the acceptance , a monte carlo simulation of the photon beam was moved by these amounts . the overall uncertainty on the acceptance from these effects is @xmath25 , as given in the first row of the table .",
    "the acceptance is directly proportional to the fraction of photons converted in the exit window ( a very small faction from the air also ) .",
    "uncertainties on the cross section for conversion , material in the window , and the window thickness lead to an uncertainty on the acceptance of @xmath26 , shown in the next row .",
    "several other effects were considered and estimated to be @xmath27 .",
    "these include pile - up of bremsstrahlung photons , deadtime measurement , knowledge of the dipole field , trigger threshold correction , and the theoretical bethe - heitler cross section .    for the early operations , uncertainties in the acceptance , window conversions , and other issues resulted in an overall @xmath28 estimated error in the luminosity determination . with time and experience , this error will decrease .",
    "the most important step in achieving this will be the direct and empirical determination of the acceptance and conversion fraction , using the 6 meter tagger located near the ip .",
    "this device collects an unbiased sample of recoil bremsstrahlung electrons , with companion photon energies within the acceptance of the luminosity spectrometer . for such tagger events ,",
    "the fraction with detected photons constitutes a direct measure of the product @xmath29 in eqn .",
    "[ eqno10 ] . after appropriate experience and experimentation",
    ", we anticipate the ultimate uncertainty in luminosity measurement to be about @xmath26 .",
    "in summary , the luminosity spectrometer has been successfully brought into operation .",
    "the device has been used to measure luminosity for the 2004 data collection by zeus with an estimated error of @xmath28 .",
    "operations were largely as anticipated .",
    "the only major obstacle was the very intense synchrotron radiation field in the region of the calorimeters .",
    "this radiation compromised somewhat the operations of the wavelength - shifting readout of the calorimeter scintillators . with recent and ongoing shielding improvements , along with direct measurements of the product of the photon conversion fraction and acceptance ,",
    "we anticipate achieving luminosity measurements with about @xmath26 uncertainty with the luminosity spectrometer system .",
    "we thank i.  abt for her help on the construction of the radiation monitor and her very helpful discussions and comments on the paper , m.  gil and w.  ruchlewicz for their support on the daq system , c.  muhl for his help on the detector shielding construction , and u.  stoesslein for her help on zeus offline software organization ."
