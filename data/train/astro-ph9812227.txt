    "the virgo cluster , alongside its counterpart in fornax , is the nearest sizeable galaxy cluster .",
    "it is close enough for detailed morphological studies to be possible even for low luminosity dwarf galaxies .",
    "it is an irregular , poor cluster of bautz - morgan type iii ( abell 1975 ) and abell richness class 0 . as such",
    ", it allows detailed studies of the dwarf population in an environment substantially different from the local group and other nearby groups .",
    "a seminal study was carried out by binggeli , sandage and tammann , who generated the virgo cluster catalog consisting of 1277 galaxies classified as certain members and a further 574 possible members over an area of 140  deg@xmath3 ( binggeli et al .",
    "membership was assigned by visual inspection , essentially based on the larger angular sizes of the cluster galaxies compared with the background population .",
    "their dwarfs conformed to a moderately steep luminosity function ( sandage et al .",
    "1985 , binggeli et al . 1988 ) .",
    "various detailed studies of cluster members have been performed subsequently , including the dwarf population ( e.g. ferguson & sandage 1989 , binggeli & cameron 1993 , durrell 1997 , young & currie 1998 ) .    of particular note , impey , bothun & malin ( 1988 ) performed a survey for large angular size low surface brightness galaxies in a single schmidt field centred on the m87 cluster core , using a photographic stacking technique .",
    "they identified 137 galaxies having central surface brightnesses in the range 23 to 26  b  mag  arcsec@xmath2 , of which 27 were new detections .",
    "the properties of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function are poorly constrained outside the local group , both in terms of the numbers and characteristics of the galaxies .",
    "some studies have found evidence for very steep luminosity functions in both cluster ( e.g. de propris et al .",
    "1995 , smith , driver & phillipps 1997 , trentham 1997 , 1998a ) and field ( loveday 1997 , morgan , smith & phillipps 1998 ) environments . at the very lowest luminosities , dwarf",
    "spheroidal galaxies have been identified in nearby groups ( e.g. caldwell et al . 1998 ) , extending the number of known dsphs and allowing a comparison of their properties with local group members .",
    "the importance of very low luminosity galaxies in understanding galaxy formation ( e.g. frenk et al .",
    "1996 , kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ) and evolution ( gallagher & wyse 1994 , caldwell et al .",
    "1998 , trentham 1998b ) demands that progress is made in identifying and studying extremely low luminosity dwarfs in new environments ( see phillipps et al .",
    "1998a , and references therein ) .",
    "in order to extend surveys of galaxies to fainter surface brightnesses than previous surveys and over a full ten degree square region of the cluster , the bristol ",
    "anglo - australian observatory survey is using multiple exposures with the united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) on kodak tech pan emulsion through an r band filter ( schwartzenberg , phillipps & parker 1995 , schwartzenberg & phillipps 1995 , 1997 , schwartzenberg 1996 , phillipps et al .",
    "1998b , jones et al .",
    "six individual exposures of each virgo field of 1  @xmath4 hour duration are digitally stacked to give a total integration time of 7 hours .",
    "the tech pan emulsion combines a high efficiency ( approaching 10% , parker et al .",
    "1998 , phillipps & parker 1993 ) and fine grains ( providing a high imaging resolution of 5  microns and a high uniformity ) .",
    "the four ukst fields of the virgo survey area are shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "field coordinates have been selected so as to cover a 100  deg@xmath3 region centred on the m87 cluster core ( `` cluster  a '' of binggeli , sandage & tammann 1987 ) .",
    "the data therefore survey both the region of high density in the core and the lower density regions at the periphery .",
    "the survey area extends south as far as the m49 cluster ( `` cluster b '' ) and includes the `` m cloud '' west of the m87 cluster .",
    "the central area in the grid has been imaged on all 24 films , in effect providing a further 1  mag depth gain in this region and offering the opportunity of a deeper survey in a restricted area .",
    "table  [ tab-1 ] presents details of the four fields .",
    ".the four quadrants of the surveyed area .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     a total of 56  000 images were detected over the two fields . from these a subsample of galaxies was selected having central surface brightnesses in the range @xmath5 to 24.5  r  mag  arcsec@xmath2 and scale lengths @xmath6  arcsec after fitting exponential light profiles to the data . through a detailed comparison of the numbers of virgo galaxies with the south galactic pole field population at each point in the magnitude ",
    "surface brightness plane , it is possible to remove the background contamination .",
    "the overall contamination of the sample is expected to be 8  per cent .",
    "after this background subtraction , the sample contains 1570 galaxies across the two fields .",
    "a luminosity function can be constructed by binning the background - subtracted galaxy densities by magnitude .",
    "the luminosity function of this sample is found to be steep , with a formal faint end slope of @xmath7 ( phillipps et al .",
    "1998b ) , and as such is comparable with the steep functions found in some more distant clusters ( e.g. driver et al .",
    "1994 , de propris et al .",
    "1995 , smith , driver & phillipps 1997 , wilson et al .",
    "1997 , trentham 1997 , 1998a ) . at the bright end ,",
    "galaxy numbers are consistent with those of sandage , binggeli and tammann ( 1985 ) .",
    "the dwarf density in the cluster core field is actually smaller than that in the outer field ( 430 galaxies deg@xmath2 against 560  deg@xmath2 ) .",
    "the dense environment in the cluster core , and particularly the presence of m87 , may have a direct effect on the low surface brightness galaxy population , either through the removal of these galaxies or suppressing their formation .",
    "a similar effect has been found in the core of the coma cluster by thompson & gregory ( 1993 ) .",
    "progress is underway on reducing the full 100  deg@xmath8 virgo survey area . to date , 23 of the required 24 exposures have been taken .",
    "it is intended that the full survey will measure the background population using data identical in format to those from virgo , reducing systematic errors which might be introduced during the subtraction of the background galaxy numbers .",
    "work is therefore progressing on the virgo northwest field and on a background field centred at right ascension 10h 40 m , declination 0@xmath9 ( 1950 ) .",
    "the photometric calibration has been accomplished using r band observations on the anglo - australian telescope obtained for other projects .    for data reduction , each field is subdivided into 16 subregions , each @xmath10 pixels .",
    "data are stored as 4-byte numbers per pixel , and therefore each 1/16-th section is 185  mbyte in size .",
    "new computer hardware resources provide sufficient memory to reduce each @xmath10 pixel section as a whole , avoiding any need to break these sections into a large number of smaller regions as was done in the initial survey .",
    "this has the advantage of much simpler data handling than would be needed if large numbers of small sections were used .",
    "similarly , establishing astrometric reference frames for a very large number of different sections would be prohibitive .",
    "as in the case of the initial survey of 3.2  deg@xmath3 , emphasis is being put on searches for small angular size low surface brightness dwarfs . however ,",
    "the feasibility of performing a parallel survey with a different sky background subtraction is being investigated , in order to allow searches for large angular size low surface brightness galaxies of the type studied by impey , bothun and malin ( 1988 ) , but over a wider area than was available for their study .",
    "the new survey is already providing large samples of candidate virgo cluster dwarf spheroidal galaxies suitable for more detailed study .",
    "the galaxies have absolute magnitudes as faint as @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( for @xmath13  km@xmath14 ) .",
    "they will be important for addressing questions relating to the properties and evolution of the lowest luminosity galaxies in an environment very different from that in nearby galaxy groups .",
    "an initial survey of 3.2  deg@xmath3 has found a high density of these galaxies and evidence for a steep luminosity function .",
    "the survey is continuing over an area of 100  deg@xmath3 .",
    "the very large numbers of dwarf spheroidals should reduce the errors in the faint end of the luminosity function and help to define its shape .",
    "they will enable clear differences to be found at these very faint limits between the cluster core and periphery to significantly better accuracy than has been possible for any other cluster before now .",
    "a parallel survey of the fornax cluster is planned for which several films are already available .",
