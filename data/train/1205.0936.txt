    "since einstein introduced the cosmological term ( @xmath9 ) in 1917 @xcite , several works have been proposed around the topic . however , including the research and observations of hubble et al .",
    "@xcite , many of them have rejected the need for it as a requirement of cosmology . nevertheless , the term s existence is still an issue because vacuum energy density has been discovered in studies on quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this still fails to provide a solution , as evidenced by the profound awareness of weinberg , who indicates that vacuum energy densities can not be candidates for the cosmological term @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the term , which has a new role as the effective cosmological constant ( ecc , @xmath2 ) , became an active player again due to the amazing observations proposed by riess and schmidt et al . in 1998",
    "@xcite and perlmutter et al . in 1999",
    "these oppose intuition , revealing that our universe is expanding with acceleration .",
    "whereafter , since observational data draws out the famous tiny @xmath2 problem,{ev^{4}}$ ] ; spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in electroweak ( ew ) theory , @xmath10{ev^{4}}$ ] ; quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , @xmath11{ev^{4}}$ ] .",

    "@xcite indicates a new scenario  inflationary theory  that enables our universe to solve the problems which emerge when observations are made using hot big bang theory .",
    "these problems are the homogeneous , isotropic , horizon , flatness , initial perturbation , magnetic monopole , total mass , total entropy and so on .",
    "further reading in @xcite . ] accordingly , vacuum energy density demands attention once again , because it needs to be of a huge value in order to initially trigger inflation . due to these works",
    ", we are now aware of a bigger picture that illustrates how the universe ( smoothly ) ends inflation . furthermore , other outstanding research  the reheating @xcite and warm inflation @xcite scenarios provides detailed discussion - material for questions relating to the course of the creation of matter in the very early universe .    as is evident from the history of physics , simplicity and continuity",
    "are usually required indications of success for new theories . however , even though the simplest explanations in this case are that the cosmological constant can play the role of a fundamental constant in the equation of general relativity , or be a nonzero minimum potential of some scalar field(s ) , there remain coincidental problems that can not be abandoned @xcite .",
    "therefore we believe that the simplest explanation for accelerating expansion is the remaining inflaton potential . based on these beliefs and the knowledge of mechanics ,",
    "we are able to suggest a guess  the `` effective friction''to balance the `` force '' dependent on the remaining inflaton potential @xcite . truthfully speaking ,",
    "this is not an entirely fresh idea because similar thoughts have been mentioned in the warm inflation theory of berera , fang , moss and others @xcite . in particular , their work has analyzed the `` dissipation term the field equation of warm inflation is proposed as @xmath13 @xmath14 is the dissipation term.]''a kind of damping force of inflaton  in the interaction of fields @xcite .",
    "if our conjecture about effective friction proves feasible , an `` effective static frictional force '' is actually needed for a produced and fixed cosmological constant .",
    "nevertheless , such a force is very difficult to imagine in field theory and only leads to the discussion of logic and phenomenon outlined in our last paper @xcite .",
    "however , a relationship between @xmath1 ( the final particle number of radiation _ inside an arbitrary chosen comoving volume _ , the final comoving particle number or fcpn for short ) and @xmath2 ( ecc ) has been found , even if it is only obtained through the phenomenon of inflaton dynamics .",

    "what is more , we can provide a numerical result that approaches to the current observational estimates @xcite .",
    "now , we would like to introduce our consideration in the following context .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : firstly , in section [ sec : effective - friction ] we will indicate the relationship of energy transfer between inflaton and radiation during the inflation course .",
    "the discussion of effective friction will be reviewed later . in section",
    "[ sec : cpn - lambda ] , besides proposing a relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we will also present a discussion about the essence of @xmath1 and the relationship between @xmath1 and the corresponding entropy obtained from a chosen comoving volume .",
    "meanwhile , numerical results will be shown in table [ tab : n_vs_lamda ] . in section [ sec : prob_l - pcc ] , we will provide a consistent illustration for the coefficient of radiation creation as defined in section [ sec : cpn - lambda ] . employing the discovery of the coefficient s structure",
    ", we gain the following three benefits : 1 . a new inflaton field equation ; 2 . a reasonable explanation for the expectation that @xmath2 and @xmath1 are the probabilistic productions ; 3 .",
    "the discovery of the courses that the particle number will be decreased at some stages . based on these benefits , a further discussion about @xmath7 will be proposed .",
    "finally , we will offer conclusions and discussions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in addition , a toy example to depict our findings will be proposed in appendix [ apx : pc - example ] .",

    "the definitions and illustrations of needed symbols are listed in table [ tab : symbol - definition ] on the last page .",
    "we strongly suggest the reader to peruse this table prior to beginning the paper as it will aid with later discussions .",
    "first of all , we should illustrate the models and conditions for describing the energy transfer between inflaton ( @xmath5 , which is set as a real scalar field ) and radiation ( @xmath16 , the relativistic particles ) _ during and after _ the epoch of inflation .",
    "we assume that our universe was also homogeneous and isotropic at the very early age .",
    "therefore , the frw line element @xmath17 is the spatial scale factor .",
    "we define @xmath18 .",
    "the adopted comoving coordinates are @xmath19=\\left(t,\\ , r,\\,\\theta,\\,\\varphi\\right)$ ] .",
    "@xmath20 is the curvature parameter that takes values of @xmath21 ( pseudo-3-sphere ) , @xmath22 ( flat space ) or @xmath23 ( 3-sphere ) for the geometry of a universe . ]",
    "@xmath24 should be employed to provide the spacetime background for the equation of general relativity , as @xmath25 here , we order equation to contain inflaton and radiation but without the cosmological constant / term . for the sake of simplicity and consistency with ,",
    "@xmath26 ( the inflaton energy - momentum tensor ) and @xmath27 ( the radiation energy - momentum tensor ) should be off - diagonal .",
    "@xmath28 guarantees this off - diagonal and provides components of @xmath26 , @xmath29 when we employ @xmath30 .",
    "here we define the minimum value of inflaton potential ( @xmath31 ) as zero . besides , due to the form of the radiation energy - momentum tensor , @xmath32 ( owing to the pressure of radiation @xmath33 ) , the 4-velocity of radiation @xmath34 must obviously be @xmath35=\\left(1,\\,0,\\,0,\\,0\\right)\\label{eq:2.5}\\ ] ] to obey the requirement that our universe has no net matter - current on average .",
    "the following two facts are worthy of note : firstly , the conditions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are consistent with a perfect fluid which has no net current , i.e. , the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath36 and the 4-velocity of elements should be @xmath37=\\left(1,\\,0,\\,0,\\,0\\right)$ ] . since @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , we regard it as a condition that the elements must be static at the comoving coordinates",

    "the law becomes the form of energy conservation , as @xmath45.\\label{eq:2.6}\\ ] ] clearly , this shows the relationship of energy transfer between @xmath5 and radiation . based on the considerations of @xcite and @xcite , we now introduce two postulates :",

    "the particle creation course for our adiabatic universe    can be regarded as a self - heating system .",
    "we now temporarily separate    our universe into a real part and an imaginary part .",
    "meanwhile , we put    the created particles into the `` real universe '' , and the `` heater ''    into the `` imaginary universe '' .",
    "it is very easy to see that the    entropy of the real will increase during the course of particle    creation , i.e. , the gibbs equation for the `` real universe '' is    @xmath48    however , if we combine the real with the imaginary , the gibbs equation    should be written as    @xmath49    due to the energy , @xmath50 , output    from the `` heater ''",

    "this is where the famous continuity equation of the standard model of cosmology comes in .",

    "of course , the neutrino number inside the presently observable universe ( @xmath150 ) is still @xmath151 .",
    "one point worthy of attention is the fact that result can be applied to cmb and wimp dark matter ( @xmath152 ) because they are the known decoupled species .",
    "of course , this requires the species of wdm to be a kind of fermion .",
    "and then we can employ the same thought to estimate these particle number inside the comoving volume for any chosen coordinate distance .",
    "now , we have to talk about the role and essence of @xmath1 . in section [ sec : introduction ] , the words of `` particle number '' has defined as the _ sum of lepton , baryon ( quark ) and gauge boson _ _ number_. however , we can also count the cpn by using the classification of the species of particles ( such as photon , electron , neutrino , quark , and so on ) .",
    "dependent on the consideration , the following statements should be highlighted to facilitate further discussion :    1 .   according to subsection [ sub : ce - cpn ] ,",
    "the cpn of an arbitrary decoupled species @xmath127 ( @xmath153 ) is proportional to its entropy ( @xmath154 ) , which can be obtained from a chosen comoving volume ( @xmath155 ) at the time ( @xmath156 ) when the species @xmath127 decouples from others .",
    "moreover , we can conclude that no net energy current manifests between arbitrary comoving volumes inside the universe , not only because the decoupled species has stopped its interactions with other species , but also due to the belief that our universe is unique or adiabatic .",
    "therefore , the entropy of a decoupled species inside a comoving volume should be a constant , even if the volume is expanding .",
    "this is equivalent to the other fact : namely that the cpn of an arbitrary decoupled species is also incontestably a constant .",
    "2 .   due to the spirit of the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac distributions",
    ", we can employ the temperature to relate the ( energy or number ) density of a _ relativistic species_. on the other hand , a relativistic species density can be employed to relate the temperature of the species .",
    "( here , the properties of @xmath78 and @xmath79 should be satisfied . ) thus , when a species @xmath127 drops out of thermal equilibrium , its temperature and density will evolve independently .",
    "this is the meaning of the `` decoupling '' .",
    "since the system what we concern is adiabatic , the comoving entropy of the species @xmath127 will be a constant after its decoupling , namely , the cpn of the species @xmath127 will be also invariant .",
    "for this reason , we absolutely can employ the time of @xmath156 to represent the time while the species @xmath127 is ceased to produce , and the constant cpn of the species @xmath127 can be shown as @xmath153 . from the viewpoint of the particle physics , the decoupling of a species means that the species will no longer interact with others .",
    "it is of course that a decoupled species will not become another species .",
    "3 .   equations and remind us that the e(s)ff is dependent on @xmath157 .",
    "for this reason , any situation which can change this number will also weaken or strengthen the eff .",
    "of course , the value of the cosmological constant will be moved indirectly by the change of the cpn .",
    "( the situation of @xmath158 is a very special case that will be discussed in subsection [ sub : probabilistic - l - cpn ] . )",
    "thus , in our scenario , a fixed ecc implies that the universe has a finite and constant cpn @xmath159 .",
    "however , according to the @xmath2-cpn relationship , an observable variation of @xmath2 needs a sufficient number fluctuation to occur at the same cosmic time throughout the entire universe .",
    "in other words , if the comoving number fluctuation is _ not enough _ , or the fluctuation is local ( even if it is very big ) , the observable variation of @xmath2 will not be discovered by us or any alien .",
    "surely , the number @xmath1 which appears in this paper means the _ total _ cpn , i.e. , @xmath160 as we know , some species which still have interactions with others can be found in stars , the center of galaxies , our accelerators , nukes , and even in light bulbs ( photons only ) etc . due to the facts , we can separate these species into the part of @xmath161 .",
    "it is now known that if we ignore the case of neutrino oscillation , the lepton number and baryon ( quark ) number will be conserved after the gut ( grand unified theory ) phase .",
    "put simply , @xmath161 can be regarded as the constant for a big enough comoving volume .",
    "( since , throughout the entire universe , the energy density of the photons created by stars and humankind is too small . )    according to the present data , the estimate of wimp dark matter @xmath162 is close to @xmath163 @xcite ; cmb data supports @xmath164 @xcite . including the cbn comoving number , these provide a similar figure of @xmath165 inside the comoving volume ( @xmath166",
