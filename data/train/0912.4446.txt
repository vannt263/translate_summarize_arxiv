    "the flow of electric current in nis ( normal metal - insulator - superconductor ) tunnel junctions is accompanied by heat transfer from the normal metal into the superconductor.@xcite this phenomenon arises due to selective tunneling of high - energy quasiparticles out of the normal metal which is induced by the superconducting energy gap .",

    "serious limitations of the cooling effect arise from the fact that nonequilibrium quasiparticles injected into the superconducting electrode accumulate near the tunnel interface.@xcite the consequences are the backtunneling of hot quasiparticles to the normal metal@xcite , the emission of phonons ( by the recombination of nonequilibrium quasiparticles into cooper pairs ) that partially penetrate the normal metal,@xcite and the overheating of the superconducting electrode.@xcite all these effects reduce the efficiency of nis refrigerators .",
    "this problem can be solved by imposing a local thermal equilibrium in the superconducting electrode.@xcite so called quasiparticle traps,@xcite made of an additional normal metal layer covering the superconducting electrode , remove hot quasiparticles from the superconductor and are thus beneficial in this respect .",

    "it arises from the intrinsic multiparticle nature of current transport in nis junctions which is governed not only by single - particle tunneling but also by two - particle ( andreev ) tunneling .",

    "are exponentially suppressed in the subgap voltage region @xmath6 , and the charge is mainly transferred by means of andreev reflection of quasiparticles with energies @xmath7.@xcite the andreev current @xmath8 does not transfer heat through the ns interface but rather generates the joule heating @xmath9 which is deposited in the normal metal electrode@xcite and dominates single - particle cooling at low enough temperatures . thus the interplay between the single - particle tunneling and andreev reflection sets a limiting temperature for the refrigeration .",

    "although these effects give small contributions to the energy and electric currents separately , the cooling power @xmath61 , being a relatively small difference of the energy current and the joule heat , is very sensitive to small details of the charge and energy transport .",

    ".    now we proceed to the discussion of our results .",
    "the effect of the joule heat generated by the andreev current @xmath8 on the cooling power is illustrated by voltage dependencies @xmath212 in fig .",
    "[ coolingv ] , where the solid curves depict full cooling power , and the dashed curves were calculated at @xmath213 . for a highly - resistive tunnel junction [ @xmath214 , fig .",
    "[ coolingv](a ) ] , the heating effect due to andreev current is negligibly small . for smaller junction resistance [ @xmath215 ,",
    "[ coolingv](b ) ] , the heating effect essentially modifies the result ; in particular , at low enough temperature , @xmath216 , it makes @xmath212 negative at all voltages .",
    "this is due to the fact that for phase - coherent diffusive proximity systems , the two - particle contribution to the subgap transport is anomalously strong at low energies.@xcite    = 8.6 cm    = 8.6 cm    as it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ coolingv ] , the cooling power approaches a maximum at a certain optimal bias voltage @xmath217 which depends on both the temperature and the tunneling parameter .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dependence @xmath218 is almost universal within a wide range of the tunneling parameter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ coolingt](a ) . at @xmath219 ,",
    "the optimal bias formally turns to zero which means that at these temperatures the cooling power becomes negative for all voltages .",
    "existence of the upper limiting temperature for the cooling effect is explained by the increase in the number of thermally excited quasiparticles which produce enhanced joule heat . as the temperature decreases , the optimal bias rapidly increases and approaches a value rather close to the energy gap @xmath220 .",

    ", the cooling power tends to zero , which defines the lower limiting temperature for the cooling regime . as follows from fig .",
    "[ coolingt](b ) , the temperature @xmath223 increases with the tunnel parameter , approaching @xmath224 for @xmath225 ; this is because the andreev current and the associated joule heat increase with the junction transparency more rapidly than the single - particle cooling power . at temperatures just above @xmath223",
    ", the function @xmath212 at small applied voltage is negative ; thus , the electron temperature is expected to increase first with the bias due to andreev current heating before it decreases due to the single - particle cooling effect .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in experiments@xcite at very low temperatures .",
    "the dependencies of the optimal bias on the tunneling parameter @xmath194 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ coolingw](a ) . in accordance with the above - mentioned universality of the curves @xmath218 for different values of @xmath194 ,",
    "the dependence @xmath226 is rather weak at @xmath227 . within this region",
    "the cooling power at optimal bias , @xmath228 $ ] , linearly increases with @xmath194 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ coolingw](b ) , which is expected when single electron tunneling dominates . for larger values of the tunnel parameter ,",
    "the andreev current heating dominates over the single - particle cooling and leads to a rapid decrease of the cooling power , which tends to zero at a certain onset point , as seen from fig .",
    "[ coolingw](b ) . as the temperature decreases , the role of andreev processes becomes more important , therefore the onset shifts towards smaller values of @xmath194 .",
    "as noted in the introduction , in most experiments the refrigerator is arranged as a double - barrier sinis junction,@xcite where the s electrodes are massive reservoirs , and n is a normal metal strip .",
    "generally , in such structures the charge and energy transport is due to multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) of quasiparticles from the ns interfaces.@xcite during every passage across the junction , the electrons and the retro - reflected holes gain an energy @xmath142 , which allows them eventually to overcome the energy gap and to escape into the s reservoirs .",
    "this results in a strong quasiparticle nonequilibrium characterized by intense electron heating within the subgap energy region , which has been detected in the experiments.@xcite from this point of view the cooling effect observed in sinis junction looks at a first glance somewhat surprising .",
    "however , the inelastic scattering processes impose strong limitations for the existence of the mar regime : in order to provide quasiparticle diffusion through the whole mar staircase , from @xmath229 to @xmath205 , the quasiparticle dwell time in the n lead , @xmath230 , must be smaller than the inelastic relaxation time @xmath231 ( for details , see ref .  ) .",
    "in typical cooling experiments on sinis junctions with low - transparent sn interfaces,@xcite the dwell time greatly exceeds @xmath231 , which prevents accumulation of the quasiparticle energy gains and thus destroys the mar regime .",
    "correspondingly , the distribution functions in the n lead become close to local - equilibrium ones , @xmath232 , \\label{fsinis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath233 is the voltage at the given point @xmath234 .",
    "the variations in @xmath233 are of the order of @xmath235 , i.e. , negligibly small compared to the applied voltage @xmath236 which mainly drops at the tunnel barriers .",
    "this implies that the distribution functions are close to equilibrium functions in a normal reservoir . in this case",
    "the sinis junction behaves as two nis junctions connected in series through the equilibrium normal reservoir . as for the spectral angle , in long junctions , @xmath140",
    ", it can be approximated by the solution of the usadel equation for a semi - infinite nis structure;@xcite simultaneously , this solution is also a good approximation to our solution for a long nn@xmath0is structure .    from this",
    "we conclude that our results can be applied to the description of electron cooling in sinis structures with large quasiparticle dwell times .",
    "similar modelling of a sinis junction by a series of two nis junctions has been used in ref .   for the calculation of the differential conductance .",
    "we have developed a quantitative theory of charge and heat transport in one - dimensional and planar nn@xmath0is tunnel junctions and studied the effect of electron cooling in such structures .",
    "we extend the microscopic approach by bardas and averin,@xcite originally applied to constriction - type junctions , to structures of arbitrary length and thin - film geometry used in practice for microcooler fabrication .",
    "we found that the contribution of two - particle ( andreev ) current to the joule heat generated in the normal reservoir noticeably modifies the cooling effect , especially at low temperatures and/or in rather transparent junctions .",
    "the interplay between the andreev current heating and the single - particle cooling , whose intensity rapidly decreases with temperature , determines the lower limiting temperature @xmath223 for the cooling regime .",
    "when the transparency of the nis interface increases , the andreev processes play a more essential role , therefore the temperature @xmath223 increases . at high temperatures ,",
    "the cooling regime is confined by the enhancement of the joule heat due to thermally excited quasiparticles ; the maximal cooling temperature is about @xmath237 , being almost independent of the junction resistance . as a result",
    ", the cooling effect persists within a specific temperature interval and approaches a maximum at the temperatures @xmath238 .",
    "we pay special attention to the analysis of the optimum bias voltage @xmath239 , at which the cooling power approaches a maximum for given temperature @xmath207 and the tunneling parameter @xmath194 .",
    "we found that @xmath217 exhibits a virtually universal temperature dependence for different values of the tunneling parameter and approaches values close to the energy gap as long as the temperature decreases .",
    "the cooling power at optimum bias voltage first increases linearly with @xmath194 until the andreev current heating abruptly suppresses the cooling regime .",
    "we discussed the applicability of our results to the description of the cooling effect in sinis junctions .",
    "we show that such a double - barrier structure can be modeled by a series of two independent nis junctions , provided the quasiparticle dwell time inside the junction greatly exceeds the inelastic relaxation time .",
    "this condition , which is usually satisfied in cooling experiments,@xcite enables one to extend the theory presented here to the case of the sinis microcoolers .    from our considerations",
    "we conclude that the andreev current is one of the most serious factors of limitation of the electron cooling efficiency . in order to reduce this factor ,",
    "one should address materials in which the proximity effect and , correspondingly , the andreev current are strongly suppressed .",
