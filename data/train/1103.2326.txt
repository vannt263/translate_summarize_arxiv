    "in @xcite , the authors consider generalisations of ramsey - type problems where the goal is not to find a monochromatic subgraph , but a subgraph that uses `` few '' colours .",
    "in particular , the following theorem is proven :    for @xmath2 , in every @xmath1-colouring of a complete graph with @xmath3 vertices there is a @xmath0-coloured matching of size @xmath4 .",
    "this is sharp for every @xmath5 , i.e. there is a @xmath1-colouring of @xmath6 that does not contain a @xmath0-coloured matching of size @xmath4 .",
    "the example that shows the sharpness of the estimate is close to the colouring obtained by first colouring the vertices with the available colours in proportion close to @xmath7 and then colouring the edges by the lowest index colour among its endpoints .",
    "the analogous question and construction make sense in the case of complete hypergraphs instead of @xmath8 . at the @xmath9 emlktbla workshop held at gyngystarjn in july @xmath10 ,",
    "the first nontrivial case of this question ( with @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs and @xmath1 colours ) was considered .",
    "the best known construction in this case is based on the proportion @xmath11 , and leads to the following conjecture by a. gyrfs :    for any @xmath12-colouring of the complete @xmath13-uniform hypergraph on @xmath14 vertices , there exists a @xmath15-coloured matching of size @xmath4 .",
    "while it is known that the conjecture fails for e.g. @xmath16 and @xmath17 , several particular cases are open .",
    "we consider here only @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath17 , in which case the conjecture has the form    [ thm : premain ] for any @xmath1-colouring of the complete @xmath1-uniform hypergraph on @xmath20 vertices , there exists a @xmath0-coloured matching of size @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath21 ( the first case that is not a trivial consequence of the existing results for the monochromatic problem , see e.g. @xcite ) was confirmed at the workshop by a team consisting of n. bushaw , a. gyrfas , d. gerbner , l. merchant , d. piguet , a. riet , d. vu and the author :    [ thm : kozos ] for any @xmath1-colouring of the complete @xmath1-uniform hypergraph on @xmath22 vertices there exists a perfect matching that uses at most @xmath0 colours .    in this paper",
    ", we prove theorem [ thm : premain ] in the following equivalent form :    [ thm : main ] for any @xmath1-colouring of the complete @xmath1-uniform hypergraph on @xmath23 vertices , there exists a @xmath0-coloured matching of size @xmath24    it is easy to check that these indeed are formulations of the same result as @xmath25 is the smallest integer for which @xmath26 holds .",
    "in the proof , the set of vertices of the hypergraph will be denoted by @xmath27 , the colouring will be a function @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 will be an arbitrary permutation of the colours @xmath32 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the colours are shifted cyclically , e.g. if @xmath33 , then @xmath34 denotes the colour @xmath32 and if @xmath35 , then @xmath36 denotes the colour @xmath1 .",
    "a matching on @xmath23 vertices is _ near perfect _",
    ", if it has size @xmath37 .",
    "we call a sextuple @xmath38 of points _ @xmath29-dominated _ for a colour @xmath39 , if for all splittings @xmath40 into two disjoint triples at least one of @xmath41 or @xmath42 holds .",
    "if @xmath38 is not @xmath29-dominated for any @xmath29 , we call it _ universal_.",
    "similarly , we call a set @xmath43 of @xmath44 points universal if it admits a near perfect matching in any pair of colours .",
    "the proof proceeds by taking a maximal set of disjoint universal sets @xmath45 , @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "if we can now construct a @xmath0-colour matching on @xmath49 of the size @xmath50 , then we can extend it by the appropriately coloured near perfect matchings in the universal sets @xmath51 and @xmath52 and keep the size of the matching at least @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , in the case of an @xmath51 decreasing @xmath23 by @xmath54 decreases @xmath55 by at most @xmath56 and in the case of an @xmath52 decreasing @xmath23 by @xmath44 decreases @xmath55 by @xmath57 .",
    "thus by switching to @xmath58 we may assume that there are no universal sets of size @xmath54 or @xmath44 , and the resulting structural properties of the colouring will give us the necessary large @xmath0-colour matching .",
    "if a vertex sextuple is @xmath29-dominated , and there are splittings of it into hyperedges of colours @xmath29 and @xmath34 as well as into those of colours @xmath29 and @xmath59 , we call this sextuple a _ spread _ in colour @xmath29 , and the splittings are its _ demonstration splittings_. depending of whether the hyperedges of colour @xmath29 in the demonstration splittings overlap in @xmath32 or @xmath0 vertices , we assign the spread ( with a fixed demonstration splitting implied ) a level of @xmath32 or @xmath0 respectively .",

    "then the following property holds for @xmath64 or for @xmath65 ( or both ) : if we substitute @xmath62 for any vertex of the dominantly coloured triple in either demonstration splitting of the spread @xmath43 , the colour of that triple stays the same , the dominating colour of @xmath43 .",
    "indirectly assume that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are splittings which v `` spoils '' .",
