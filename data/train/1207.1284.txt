    "being a subject of practical importance , elasto - plastic deformation of dense granular media has been under the focus of engineering research for many decades if not centuries  @xcite .",
    "the state of engineering theories , however , is confusing for physicists : innumerable continuum mechanical models compete , employing strikingly different expressions . in a recent book on soil mechanics , phrases such as _ morass of equations _ and _ jungle of data _ were employed as metaphors  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this competition is among theories applicable only to the slow shear rates of elasto - plastic deformation , while rapid dense flow ( such as heap flow , mud slide or avalanches ) is taken to obey yet rather different equations  @xcite . as a result , most engineers believe it is illusory to look for a unified theory capable of simultaneously accounting for granular phenomena of arbitrary shear rates : static stress distribution at vanishing rates , the rate - independent , elasto - plastic motion at slow rates , and the rapid dense flow at high rates .    on the other hand , although many theories achieve considerable realism when confined to the effects they were constructed for , they are in essence clever renditions of complex data , not a reflection of the underlying physics",
    ". we therefore thought it may be worthwhile to try out a new starting point , by focusing on the physics , while leaving the rich and subtle granular phenomenology aside while constructing the theory .",
    "the hope was to arrive at a theory that , though not necessarily detailed or realistic in every aspect , is widely applicable over the compete range of shear rates , firmly based in physics , and affords a well founded , transparent understanding .",
    "a tried and true method to achieve this aim is to construct the so - called _ hydrodynamic theory _ that physicists take to mean the long - wave - length , continuum theory of condensed systems  in contrast to engineers , who use the word as a synonym for the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the hydrodynamic formalism was pioneered by landau  @xcite and khalatnikov  @xcite in the context of superfluid helium , and introduced to complex fluids by de gennes  @xcite .",
    "its two crucial points are : first , the input in physics that serves mainly to specify the complete set of state variables ; and second , the simultaneous consideration of energy and momentum conservation , complete with their respective fluxes . combining this with thermodynamic considerations ,",
    "one finds many more constraints , and far less liberty , than the engineering approach to constitutive relations , when constructing expressions for the stress .",
    "this is an advantage especially for granular media : if a choice of random phenomena is rendered correctly by a hydrodynamic theory , chances are that the rest is also adequately accounted for  because the theory complies with all the mentioned general principles and is founded primarily on insights into the basic physics of a system , not a subset of experimental data .",
    "hydrodynamic theories  @xcite have been derived for many condensed systems , including liquid crystals  @xcite , superfluid @xmath0he  @xcite , superconductors  @xcite , macroscopic electro - magnetism  @xcite , ferrofluids  @xcite , and polymers  @xcite .",
    "we contend that constructing a hydrodynamic theory is both useful and possible for granular media : useful , because it should help to illuminate and order their complex behavior ; possible , because a significant portion has already been done .",
    "we call it gsh , for `` granular hydrodynamic theory . ''",
    "it divides granular behavior into three regimes , with the jiggling of the grains  quantified as the granular temperature @xmath1  serving as a switch :    * at vanishing shear rates , grains hardly jiggle , and @xmath2 . static stress distribution and the propagation of elastic waves",
    "are phenomena of this regime .",
    "we call it _ quasi - elastic _ because the stress stems from deformed grains and is elastic in origin . * at slow rates , the jiggling increases and @xmath1 is slightly elevated .",
    "although the stress is still predominantly elastic , it may now relax : when the grains loose contact with one another briefly , both granular deformation and the associated stress will decrease .",
    "this is the _",
    "hypoplastic regime _ where the hypoplastic model  @xcite and other rate - independent constitutive relations are valid .",
    "typical phenomena are the _ critical state _  @xcite and _ incremental nonlinearity _ , or the strikingly different loading and unloading curves . * at high shear rates , we have the rapid dense flow behavior covered by the midi model  @xcite and bagnold flow .",
    "the jiggling is so strong that it exerts a pressure , and viscosities are important .",
    "they compete with the elastic stress , becoming dominating at very high rates .    ",
    "there are many arguments in the literature contending that granular media , being unique , violate general principles , hence do not have a hydrodynamic theory ( as first conjectured by kadanoff  @xcite ) . at closer scrutiny ,",
    "none of these arguments is watertight .",
    "four of which ( rendered in _ italic _ ) are as briefly refuted here as is appropriate for an introduction .    1 .",
    "_ `` the energy is not conserved in granular media . '' _ although the kinetic energy of the grains is not conserved , the total energy is , which includes the heat in the grains .",
    "`` fluctuation - dissipation theorem is not valid in granular media . ''",
    "_ there are two versions of it , one in terms of the granular temperature @xmath1 , the other in terms of the true temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is a general principle .",
    "it always holds and is equally applicable to a block of copper and a pile of sand , quantifying how much , eg . , the volume of each fluctuates .",
    "the former is an imperfect analogy , not a general principle .",
    "`` the onsager relation does not hold in sand , because the underlying microscopic dynamics , inelastic scattering , is irreversible . ''",
    "_ the true microscopic dynamics in sand is , as everywhere else , the reversible schrdinger equation for the constituent atoms . 4 .   _",
    "a sand pile has much more gravitational energy than a monolayer of grains .",
    "only the latter is in equilibrium , the minimal energy state .",
    "the former , being `` jammed '' and prevented to reach the former , is too far off equilibrium for thermodynamics to hold . _",
    "similar to two chambers of air separated by a stuck piston , a pile of sand at rest is in fact in equilibrium .",
    "the air is in equilibrium because all its many degrees of freedom are except one : the position of the piston that upholds a constraint on the volume of the two subsystems . in a macroscopic body ,",
    "all elastic degrees of freedom are in equilibrium if the force balance holds , implying the sum of gravitational and elastic energy is minimal .",
    "two elastic bodies , one on top of another , are also in equilibrium if the sum of their energy is minimal  though there is the constraint that the upper body must not slide with respect to the lower one .",
    "a sand pile is many little elastic bodies on top of one another . if they are constrained to stay put , and their total energy is minimal , the pile is in equilibrium .      to derive the hydrodynamic theory for granular media",
    ", one needs the input of what the essence of granular physics is .",
    "our working hypothesis is that it is encapsulated by two notions : _ two - stage irreversibility _ and _ variable transient elasticity_. the first is related to the three spatial scales of any granular media : ( a )  the macroscopic , ( b )  the mesoscopic , intergranular , and ( c )  the microscopic , inner granular . dividing all degrees of freedom into these three categories , we treat those of ( a ) differently from ( b , c ) .",
    "macroscopic degrees of freedom , such as the slowly varying stress or flow fields , are specified and employed as explicit state variables , but intergranular and inner granular degrees are treated summarily : instead of being specified , only their contribution to the energy is considered and taken , respectively , as granular and true heat .",
    "so we do not account for the motion of a jiggling grain , only include its strongly fluctuating kinetic and elastic energy as contributions to the granular heat , characterized by the granular entropy @xmath4 and temperature @xmath1 .",
    "analogously , a phonon , or any elastic vibration within the grain , are taken as part of true heat , part of @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "there are only a handful of macroscopic degrees of freedom ( a ) , innumerable intergranular ones ( b ) , and yet many orders of magnitude more inner granular ones ( c ) .",
    "so the statistical tendency to equally distribute the energy among all degrees of freedom implies that the energy decays from ( a ) to ( b , c ) , and from ( b ) to ( c ) , but never ( or hardly ever ) backwards .",
    "this is what we call _ two - stage irreversibility _ , see fig  [ 2stageirr ]     _ two - stage irreversibility_. dissipative processeses produce either granular entropy @xmath6 , or directly thermal entropy @xmath7 .",
    "eventually , @xmath6 is also converted to @xmath7 . ]",
    "the system is in equilibrium only if the true entropy is maximal .",
    "maximal granular entropy ( given in the special cases of the edward entropy by counting the number of ways to stably build a sand pile , see sec  [ tapping ] ) would characterize equilibrium , only if there were no energy decay from ( a , b ) to ( c ) , or when it is slow enough to be neglected . as",
    "the ubiquitous inelasticity of granular collisions clearly demonstrate , this is never the case .",
    "a division into three scales works well when they are clearly separated , when the system is much larger than the grains .",
    "this is indeed a problem with granular media , though one of accuracy , not viability .",
    "scale separation is usually better satisfied in engineering experiments than in some of physicists .",
    "using glass or steel beads , typically larger than sand grains , aggravates the problem .",
    "same is true of 2d experiments employing less and larger disks . on the other hand , when there is too little room for spacial averaging , one can average over time and runs that also get rid of fluctuations not contained in a continuum theory .",
    "moreover , one can go to higher order gradient terms , as we shall do in sec  [ minimal band width ] , to capture qualitatively what happens at small length scales  eg .",
    "in shear band or when clogging occurs .",
    "our second notion , _ variable transient elasticity _",
    ", addresses granular plasticity .",
    "the free surface of a granular system at rest is frequently tilted . when perturbed , when the grains jiggle and @xmath8 , the tilted surface will decay and become horizontal .",
    "the stronger the grains jiggle and slide , the faster the decay is .",
    "we take this as indicative of a system that is elastic for @xmath9 , turning transiently elastic for @xmath8 , with a stress relaxation rate that grows with @xmath1 .",
    "a relaxing stress is typical of any viscous - elastic system such as polymers .",
    "the unique circumstance here is that the relaxation rate is not a material constant , but a function of the state variable @xmath1 . as we shall see , it is this dynamically controlled , _ variable transient elasticity _  a simple fact at heart  that underlies the complex behavior of granular plasticity .",
    "realizing it yields a most economic way to capture granular rheology .    employing a strain field rather than the stress as a state variable usually yields a simpler description , because the former is in essence a geometric quantity , while the latter contains material parameters such as the stiffness constant .",
    "yet one can not use the standard strain field @xmath10 as a granular state variable , because the relation between stress and @xmath10 lacks uniqueness when the system is plastic .",
    "engineering theories frequently divide the strain into two fields , elastic and plastic , @xmath11 , with the first accounting for the reversible and second for the irreversible part .",
    "they then employ @xmath10 and @xmath12 as two independent strain fields to account for granular plasticity  @xcite .",
    "we believe that , on the contrary , the elastic strain @xmath13 is the sole state variable , as there is a unique relation between the elastic stress @xmath14 and @xmath13 , if the latter is appropriately defined via the elastic energy : shearing a granular system , a portion of the strain goes into deforming the grains individually , changing their elastic energy .",
    "the rest of the strain is spent sliding and rolling the grains . taking @xmath13 as the portion that changes the energy and deforms the grains , the energy @xmath15 is by definition a function of @xmath13 alone . and",
    "since an elastic stress @xmath14 only exists when the grains are deformed , it is also a function of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we employ @xmath13 as the sole state variable , and discard both @xmath10 and @xmath12 . doing so preserves many useful features of elasticity , especially the ( so - called hyper - elastic ) relation , @xmath16 this is derived in  @xcite but easy to understand via an analogy . driving up a snowy hill slowly",
    ", the car wheels will grip the ground part of the time , slipping otherwise .",
    "( we assume a slowly turning wheel and quickly changing , intermittent stick - slip behavior . )",
    "when the wheels do grip , the car moves upward and its gravitational energy @xmath17 is increased .",
    "if we divide the wheel s rotation into a gripping ( e ) and a slipping ( p ) portion , @xmath18 , we know we may ignore @xmath19 , and compute the torque on the wheel as @xmath20 , if the wheel turns sufficiently slowly , same as eq  ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "how much the wheel turns or slips , how large @xmath21 or @xmath19 are , is irrelevant for the torque .",
    "the only way to find out whether our two hypotheses are appropriate and complete , is to derived the theory and compare its ramifications with experiments .",
    "the theory has already been derived , see  @xcite , and is called gsh .",
    "it is briefly repeated and presented in the next chapter .",
    "the second step , finding the ramifications of gsh is a more lengthy process , in the midst of which we are .",
    "and this manuscript is an overview on the work done and planned .",
    "as mentioned , gsh has three rate regimes , given by :    * the _ quasi - elastic regime _ of vanishing shear rates , possibly below @xmath22 s@xmath23 , with a quadratically vanishing granular temperature , @xmath24 .",
    "the stress @xmath25 is purely elastic , as given by eq  ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) . *",
    "the _ hypoplastic regime _ of low shear rates , possibly between @xmath26 and 1/s , where the engineering theory of hypoplastic model  @xcite holds .",
    "the stress @xmath27 is still elastic , but softer by a factor typically between 0.2 and 0.3 .",
    "granular temperature is more elevated , allowing stress relaxation . with @xmath28",
    ", we have rate - independence .",
    "this regime is frequently hailed as the quasi - static one , because it seems slow , is rate - independent , and because the even slower quasi - elastic regime is ( as we shall see ) hard to observe .",
    "we note that the hypoplastic regime , being characterized by stress relaxation , is dissipative .",
    "it therefore can not possibly be quasi - static , implying a consecutive visit of neighboring equilibrium states . * the _ rapid flow regime _",
    ", for shear rates well above 1 s@xmath23 .",
    "we still have @xmath28 , but it is no longer small .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1-generated , seismic pressure @xmath29 and the viscous shear stress @xmath30 become significant and compete with the elastic contribution @xmath14 .",
    "this is where the midi model and bagnold flow hold .",
    "as both the pressure and the shear stress may be written as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the elastic , and @xmath33 the seismic or viscous , contributions , we have the purely quadratic dependence of the bagnold flow for @xmath34 , and hypoplastic rate - independence for @xmath35 .    ",
    "in accordance to our understanding of granular media s basic physics , its state variables are : the granular entropy @xmath4 and the elastic strain @xmath13 , in addition to the usual variables : the density @xmath36 , the momentum density @xmath37 , the true entropy @xmath5 . denoting the energy density ( in the rest frame , @xmath38 ) as @xmath39 , we define the conjugate variables as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the chemical potential , @xmath3 the temperature , @xmath1 the granular temperature , and @xmath14 the elastic stress .",
    "these are given once the energy @xmath15 is .",
    "next , in sec  [ equicond ] , equilibrium conditions will be derived , formerly , in terms of the energy and its conjugate variables , whatever @xmath15 is",
    ". then , in sec  [ granen ] , an example for @xmath15 will be given , and the conjugate variables calculated  with the help of which the equilibrium conditions are rendered explicit .",
    "a complete set of state variables is one that determines a unique macroscopic state of the system .",
    "if a set is given , there is no room for ambiguity , for  history- \" or  preparation - dependence .",
    "\" conversely , any such dependence indicates that the set is incomplete , see eg .",
    "the discussion in sec  [ hdvhv ] . in the hydrodynamic approach ,",
    "a physical quantity is a state variable if ( and only if ) the energy @xmath15 depends on it .",
    "we assume the above set is complete .",
    "having specified the thermodynamic energy @xmath15 as a function of relaxing variables such as @xmath4 , we employ in effect a generalized notion of equilibrium , and treat a state with a finite @xmath4 as being in _ quasi - equilibrium_. from a statistical mechanical point of view , this is a _ constrained equilibrium _ , because we are considering only those micro - states that are compatible with the given value of @xmath4 .",
    "( an example for such a relaxing thermodynamic variable is the magnitude of an order parameter in a ginzburg - landau theory , say the superfluid density @xmath42 , cf .",
    "such a variable needs to be macroscopically slow , so microscopic variables have time to adjust to its value . since @xmath4 typically varies on the scale of 0.1 - 1 ms in the dense limit , much slower than any microscopic time scales , @xmath4 is a valid macroscopic and quasi - thermodynamic variable . [ the notion of quasi - equilibrium also holds as local equilibrium , implying @xmath43=w[\\rho({\\bf r},t ) , s({\\bf r},t ) , s_g({\\bf r},t ) , u_{ij}({\\bf r},t)]$ ] .",
    "analogous equations hold for all the conjugate variables , see eqs  ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) . ]        requiring maximal entropy @xmath44 with appropriate constraints ( such as given energy @xmath45 and mass @xmath46 ) , one obtains the equilibrium conditions for the state variables in terms of their conjugate variables . in granular media ,",
    "remarkably , this universally valid procedure leads to two distinct sets of equilibrium conditions , the solid and the fluid one  @xcite . maximizing the entropy",
    ", we first obtain the condition of uniform true temperature @xmath47 , and the requirement that the granular temperature vanishes , @xmath9 .",
    "usually , @xmath1 vanishes quickly , and if it does , the density is not independent from the elastic strain , @xmath48 .",
    "they share a common condition that we identify as the solid one , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 the elastic stress , @xmath51 the usual expression for the fluid pressure , and @xmath52 the volume .",
    "( the derivative is taken at constant @xmath53 . )",
    "we may equivalently calculate @xmath51 as @xmath54 , holding constant @xmath55 .",
    "with the energy expression @xmath15 of the next sec  [ granen ] , @xmath56 is the pressure exerted by jiggling grains .",
    "we therefore call it the _ seismic pressure _  @xcite .",
    "clearly , equilibrium condition eq  ( [ 2a-1 ] ) , expressing force balance , is logically the result of maximal true entropy .",
    "if @xmath1 is kept finite by external perturbations , the system may further increase its entropy by independently varying @xmath36 and @xmath13 , to arrive at the fluid equilibrium .",
    "it is characterized by two conditions , the first with respect to @xmath13 , and the second with respect to @xmath36 : @xmath57 the first condition requires shear stresses to vanish in equilibrium , and free surfaces to be horizontal .",
    "the second condition is that governing reversible compaction , a phenomenon one arrives at after keeping @xmath1 finite ( such as by tapping ) for a long time , see sec  [ compaction ] .",
    "interested in hard grains that are slightly excited , implying small @xmath58 , we look for the respective lowest order terms in the energy .",
    "( as we are not , at present , interested in thermal effects such as thermal expansion , the energy s dependence on the true entropy is not discussed . ) denoting @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are the respective traceless tensors , we take the energy to be @xmath64 note @xmath13 and @xmath14 are colinear and have the same principal axes .",
    "the contribution @xmath65 is an expansion in @xmath4 .",
    "the quadratic term is the lowest order one because we require @xmath66 to be a minimum of the energy .",
    "( this is the same argument as in a ginzburg - landau expansion , though without the fourth order term or the phase transition . )",
    "as it will turn out , see eq  ( [ 2b-5 ] ) below , this lowest order term is in fact sufficient to account for fast dense flow and the gaseous state . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath1 are always small .",
    "next , we compare @xmath1 to the gaseous granular temperature @xmath67 , defined as @xmath68 of the kinetic energy per particle , see  @xcite .",
    "being a general expression for granular heat , @xmath65 includes the quickly fluctuating part of both the kinetic and elastic energy .",
    "but in the dilute limit , when the elastic contribution may be neglected , one can take @xmath65 as equal to @xmath69 ( with @xmath70 the average mass of a grain ) , and identify @xmath71    fixing the density - dependence of the coefficient @xmath72 immediately yields an expression for the seismic pressure @xmath73 .",
    "[ there is also a contribution from @xmath74 , because @xmath75 depend on the density , see eq  ( [ 2b-4 ] ) .",
    "it is neglected because it is always much smaller than @xmath76 for small @xmath77 .",
    "] we take @xmath78 with both @xmath79 and @xmath80 being positive numbers .",
    "given eq  ( [ 2b-2c ] ) ( noting the density dependence of @xmath72 ) , this is essentially the familiar pressure expression @xmath81 , see eg .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath82 of eq  ( [ 2b-1 ] ) , with @xmath83 , is the elastic contribution .",
    "its order of 2.5 is important for many granular features , especially _ stress - induced anisotropy _ ( see below ) and the _ convexity transition _ , discussed in sec  [ yield surfaces ] .",
    "the associated stress expression @xmath14 has been validated for the following circumstances , achieving good to satisfactory agreement :    * static stress distribution in three classic geometries : silo , sand pile , point load on a granular sheet , calculated using the equilibrium condition , eq  ( [ 2a-1 ] ) , see  @xcite . *",
    "small - amplitude stress - strain relation , see  @xcite .",
    "* anisotropic propagation of elastic waves , see  @xcite .",
    "an explanation of `` stress - induced anisotropy '' : in linear elasticity @xmath84 , we have constant second derivatives @xmath85 , and the velocity of a elastic wave @xmath86 does not depend on the strain , or equivalently , the stress . for any exponent other than 2 , the velocity depends on the stress , and is anisotropic if the stress is .    note",
    "that the energy @xmath87 vanishes when the grains are neither deformed nor jiggling : @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "this implies a lack of interaction among the grains .",
    "if there were any , there would be a third term in @xmath15 that is a function of @xmath36 alone .      in a space spanned by stress components and the density",
    ", there is a surface that divides two regions in any granular media , one in which the grains necessarily move , another in which they may be at rest .",
    "this surface is usually referred to as _ the yield surface_. aiming to make its definition more precise , we take the yield surface to be the divide between two regions , one in which elastic solutions are stable , and another in which they are not",
    ". clearly , the medium may be at rest for a given stress only if an appropriate elastic solution is stable . since the elastic energy of any solution satisfying the equilibrium condition eq  ( [ 2a-1 ] ) is an extremum , the energy is convex and minimal in the stable region , concave and maximal in the unstable one in which infinitesimal perturbations suffice to destroy the solution .",
    "the elastic energy of eq  ( [ 2b-2 ] ) is convex only for @xmath90 turning concave if the condition is violated",
    ". the second constraint may be derived by rewriting eq  ( [ 2b-2b ] ) as @xmath91 which shows @xmath92 is minimal for @xmath93 .",
    "this corroborates the behavior that no granular system stays static if the shear stress is too large for given pressure .",
    "we take @xmath94 to be density independent and approximately @xmath95 therefore , we only need to specify the density dependence of @xmath96 , taking it as @xmath97^{0.15},\\\\\\nonumber \\bar\\rho&\\equiv&(20\\rho_{\\ell p}-11\\rho_{cp})/9 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath98 a material constant .",
    "this expression accomplishes three things at once :    * the energy is concave for any density smaller than the random loose one @xmath99 , implying no elastic solution exists there . *",
    "the energy is convex between the random loose density @xmath99 and the random close one @xmath100 , ensuring the stability of any elastic solutions in this region .",
    "in addition , the density dependence of sound velocities as measured by harding and richart  @xcite is well rendered by @xmath101 . *",
    "the elastic energy diverges , slowly , at @xmath100 , approximating the observation that the system becomes orders of magnitude stiffer there .",
    "a widespread confusion is addressed in this section .",
    "the yield surface of eq  ( [ 2b-3 ] ) defines a yield shear stress for a given pressure .",
    "many textbooks identify this stress with the highest stress achieved in an approach to the _ critical state _ , and draw conclusions based on this identification .",
    "their justification is that the approach is typically executed at low enough shear rates to be considered _ quasi - static_. we contend that a true _ quasi - static motion _ is one that visits a series of static , equilibrium states , with @xmath2 .",
    "this happens , as mentioned above , only during _ quasi - elastic motion _ , see also sec  [ 3regimes ] . the rate - independent , hypoplastic motion , taking place during an approach to the critical state , produces an elevated @xmath1 and is strongly dissipative .",
    "therefore , the instability discussed here and the critical state discussed in sec  [ critical state ] are two distinct concepts , static versus dynamic .",
    "the first is a convexity transition of the elastic energy , to be probed by quasi - elastic motion at vanishing @xmath1 .",
    "the second is a stationary solution of the evolution equation for the elastic strain @xmath13 , and is comparable to the stationary solution of any diffusion equation .",
    "the two shear stresses are frequently similar in magnitude , but the yield stress given by eq  ( [ 2b-3 ] ) needs to be larger than the highest shear stress achieved during the approach to the critical state , see fig  [ yield - cs - pai ] below .",
    "otherwise , the system will abandon the approach and develop shear bands instead , considered in sec  [ sb ] .",

    "the full complexity of granular media emerges .",
    "nevertheless , true to our starting assumptions on granular media : _ two - stage irreversibility _ and _ variable transient elasticity _ , three scalar equations suffice to account for most phenomena .",
    "two account for transient elasticity , eqs  ( [ 2c-7xx],[2c-9xx ] ) , and one for @xmath1 , eq  ( [ 2c-4 ] ) , @xmath228 some simplifications and one modification were made to arrive at these equations : ( 1 )  the gradient of @xmath1 is assumed to be small , and linearized in ; all other variables were taken to be uniform .",

    "coarse - graining it , we may set @xmath233 to quantify this contribution , either in terms of the ambient temperature @xmath230 , or a shear rate @xmath234 needed to produce this @xmath230 . adding this term is a convenient short cut to account for a general perturbation , for an ambient temperature without specifying the cause .",
    "the information on the elastic strain @xmath235 is , for given density , identical as that of the elastic stress @xmath236 , because they are always given by the hyper - elastic relation , eq  ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) , or by eqs  ( [ 2b-2a ] , [ 2b-2b ] ) for the elastic energy eq  ( [ 2b-2 ] ) .",
    "the total stress includes the seismic pressure @xmath51 and the viscous contributions ( of which the compressional one is neglected below ) . we write ( assuming that the lowest order terms @xmath237 dominate and neglecting the term @xmath238 , of order @xmath239 ) @xmath240 [ given eq  ( [ 2b-2 ] ) , @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath171 are colinear . ] in the linear regime , @xmath220 , the elastic terms @xmath243 are ( as discussed at the end of the last section ) rate - independent , while @xmath56 and @xmath244 are quadratic in @xmath209 . so both may be written as @xmath245 , implying a quadratic dependence on the rate for @xmath246 , and rate - independence for @xmath247 .",

    "textbooks on soil mechanics take granular motion in the hypoplastic regime ",
    "say the approach to the critical state  to be quasi - static .",
    "we do not believe this is right , because although slow and rate - independent , it is also strongly dissipative and irreversible .",
    "quasi - static motion is never dissipative .",
    "think of sound propagation in any system ( such as newtonian liquid , elastic media or liquid crystals ) , where the velocity is an order in the frequency lower than the damping .",
    "so sound waves are less damped the smaller the frequency is .",
    "this is a general feature : changing a state variable : @xmath249 slowly , dissipation vanishes with the rate of change @xmath250 .",
    "the motion is therefore rate - independent in the very slow limit , in which dissipation may be neglected .",
    "we call it _ quasi - static _ because the system is at this rate visiting static , equilibrium states consecutively .",
    "granular systems are both dissipative and rate - independent in the hypoplastic regime . because of rate - independence , reactive and dissipative terms are of the same order in the frequency , and comparable in size .",
    "( they are exactly equal in the critical state . )",
    "if there were only the hypoplastic regime , elastic waves would always be overdamped .",
    "since this is not the case , there must be a dissipation - free , quasi - static one that we term quasi - elastic .",
    "a frequent suggestion is to take a small incremental strain ( such as given in an elastic wave ) to be elastic and free of dissipation , but a large one as elasto - plastic and dissipative .",
    "we believe this is the wrong way out , because it is ( taken literally ) illogical and incompatible with the notion of a quasi - static motion : starting from a static state of given stress , and applying a small incremental strain that is elastic , the system is again in a static state and an equally valid starting point . the next small increment must therefore also be purely elastic .",
    "many consecutive small increments yield a large change in strain , and if the small ones are not dissipative , neither can their sum be .    in gsh",
    ", it is the strain rate rather than strain amplitude that decides whether the system is elastic or elasto - plastic . of course",
    ", small strain increments achieved with a higher but short lasting shear rate will indeed provoke elastic responses , if @xmath1 does not have time to get to a sufficiently high value to induce plastic responses .",
    "furthermore , the mere existence of a quasi - static , quasi - elastic regime does not imply that it is also easily observable .",
    "to be specific , we quote a few numbers , though these are at best educated guesses .",
    "aside from the lack of unambiguous experimental data , circumstances are usually complicated by density or pressure dependence  @xcite .",
    "we believe , the bagnold regime starts at shear rates of one or two hundred hz , the hypoplastic regime is say between @xmath251hz , and quasi - elastic regime lies possibly below @xmath22hz .",
    "finally , we note that backtracing of the stress curve @xmath252 when reversing the strain , @xmath253 , occurs only in the quasi - elastic regime , not the hypoplastic one .",
    "( we use a hat to indicate a tensor . )",
    "the stress is a function of the elastic strain , @xmath254 .",
    "reversing @xmath255 will always backtrace @xmath252 .",
    "but only in the quasi - elastic regime may we identify @xmath256 . failure to backtrace at hypoplastic rates are not evidence of  history dependence . \"",
    "as discussed above , in the quadratic regime of very slow shear rates , @xmath257 , the granular temperature is so small that the system is essential elastic , moving from one elastic , equilibrium state to a slightly different one .",
    "this is the reason we call it _ quasi - elastic _ , or _",
    "quasi - static_. because @xmath258 and @xmath259 , the change of the the shear stress @xmath176 is well approximated by the ( hyper- ) elastic relation , @xmath260 shearing a granular medium at quasi - elastic rates , the result will be a trajectory @xmath261 that is much steeper than in experiments at hypoplastic rates , such as observed during an approaching to the critical state .",
    "the gradient is given directly by the stiffness constant @xmath262 , and possibly three to four times as large as the average between loading and unloading at hypoplastic rates [ because eq  ( [ 2c-8 ] ) lacks the factor of @xmath263 .",
    "this goes on until the system reaches a yield surface of the elastic energy , one of those discussed in sec  [ yield surfaces ] .",
    "we expect the system to form shear bands at this point , see sec  [ sb ]",
    ". the critical state will not be reached .",
    "reversing the shear rate in between will retrace the function @xmath252 .      ]",
    "quasi - elastic behavior has not been observed in triaxial apparatus , even at the lowest rates .",
    "this maybe because they are simply not slow enough . quite probably though , this is also due to the wide usage of step motors in these appliances . plotting its shear rate versus time , @xmath264 , different shear rates are approximately given as depicted by the two curves of fig  [ stepmotor ] .",
    "although the curves have different average rates @xmath265 , the time - resolved , maximal rates @xmath266 are identical . and if the time span of @xmath266 is long enough for @xmath1 to respond , and @xmath266 is high enough for the system to be in the linear regime , @xmath267 , the system will display consecutive hypoplastic behavior in both cases , irrespective of the average rate @xmath265 .",
    "we suggest two ways here to circumvent this difficulty , both by fixing the stress rate at low @xmath1 : as discussed in the last section , a given stress rate has a high shear rate at elevated @xmath1 and a low one at vanishing @xmath1",
    ". first is slowly tilting an inclined plane supporting a layer of grains .",
    "in such a situation , the shear rate remains very small , and the system starts flowing only when a yield surface is breached .",
    "in contrast , employing a feedback loop in a triaxial apparatus to maintain a stress rate would not work well , because the correcting motion typically has strain rates that are too high .",
    "a second method is to insert a very soft spring , even a rubber band , between the granular medium and the device moving at a given velocity @xmath268 to deform it .",
    "if the spring is softer by a large factor @xmath80 than the granular medium ( which is itself rather soft ) , it will absorb most of the displacement , leaving the granular medium deforming at a rate smaller by the same factor @xmath80 than without the spring .",
    "in other words , the soft spring serves as a `` stress reservoir '' for the granular medium .",
    "the same physics applies when the feedback loop is connected via a soft spring .",
    "little @xmath1 is then excited , see for instance the experiment discussed in sec  [ aging ] .",
    "hypoplastic motion occurs at an elevated @xmath220 , in what we have named the linear regime .",
    "it is _ rate - independent _ for given , constant strain rates , in the sense that the increase in the stress @xmath269 depends only on the increase in the strain , @xmath270 , not how fast it takes place .",
    "we call this regime hypoplastic because this is where the _ hypoplastic model _ holds , a state - of - the - art engineering theory  @xcite that we shall consider in sec  [ hypoplasticity ] .      in the hypoplastic regime , for given shear rate @xmath209 , the granular temperature relaxes quickly to its stationary value @xmath271 . inserting this into eqs  ( [ 2c-9 ] , [ 2c-7 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath272 which are explicitly rate - independent for @xmath273 .",
    "the last equation is a result of inserting the density dependence of eqs  ( [ density - dependence ] ) and indicates that relaxation of the elastic strain becomes slower at higher density , and stops at the close - packed density @xmath100 , where the system is essentially elastic .",
    "we take @xmath274 , as compressional relaxation is typically slower than shear relaxation  @xcite .     the hysteretic change of the shear stress ( @xmath275 ) with the strain , as accounted for by eq  ( [ 3b-3 ] ) .",

    "this phenomenon is referred to as _",
    "incremental nonlinearity _ in soil mechanics , and the reason why no backtracing takes place under reversal of shear rate : starting from isotropic stress , @xmath282 , see fig  [ fig2 ] , the gradient is at first @xmath283 , becoming smaller as @xmath139 grows , until it is zero , in the stationary case @xmath284 .",

    "the system will then interrupt its approach to the critical state , and develop shear band instead , see sec  [ sb ] .",
    "if one perturbs the system , say by exposing it to a standing sound field , or more simply , by tapping it periodically , such as in a recent experiment  @xcite , the critical state is strongly modified .",
    "this is the kind of games / explorations physicists play . to engineers",
    ", it may seem less than serious , even a bit frivolous , but it does time and again lead to useful insights . in  @xcite , a surprising rate - dependence of the critical shear stress was observed .",
    "the stress decreases with the tapping amplitude , and increases with the shear rate , such that the decrease is compensated at higher rates .",
    "clearly , engineering theories , be they elasto - plastic or hypoplastic , that build in rate - independence from the start , could not possibly account for this observation .",
    "gsh , on the other hand , should be able to , if it indeed provides a wide - range qualitative account of granular behavior .",

    "in a recent experiment , nguyen et al .",
    "@xcite pushed the system to a certain shear stress at a given and fairly fast rate , producing an elevated @xmath1 .",
    "then , switching to maintaining the shear stress , they observed a large total strain @xmath370 that appears to diverge logarithmically .",
    "the authors referred to this phenomenon as creeping , and took it to be a compelling evidence that the slow motion of the experiment contains a dynamics and can not be quasi - static .",
    "we note that this conclusion sits well with a basic contention of gsh , that what is usually taken as quasi - static motion is in fact hypoplastic , with an elevated @xmath1 , see sec  [ 3regimes ] .",

    "@xmath380 will change with time .",
    "this is what we consider here .",
    "next , in sec  [ sapc ] , we take the pressure as a constant , implying time - dependence of density and coefficients .",
    "then , as with the critical state considered in sec  [ pressure approach ] , a general solution is possible only by numerical methods .    the first equation accounts for the relaxation of @xmath77 , from both below and above @xmath381 .",
    "the relaxation is faster the more elevated @xmath1 is .",
    "writing the second equation as @xmath382 , setting @xmath213 , and employing the initial condition @xmath383 at @xmath374 , we obtain the solution @xmath384 because of eq  ( [ 3b-7a ] ) , we may rewrite the solution as @xmath385 which implies a slowly growing total strain @xmath386 as @xmath209 diminish , it will eventually enter the quasi - elastic regime , @xmath387 , and the last bit of @xmath209 relaxes exponentially . therefore , @xmath388 does not really diverge .    assuming a large rate to ramp up the stress , the initial value for the granular temperature @xmath389 is also large .",
    "this will quickly let @xmath77 be fully relaxed , @xmath390 .",
    "fixing @xmath391 is then equal to fixing the shear stress , @xmath392 . and",
    "since the critical shear stress is @xmath393 , one may rewrite the factor as @xmath394 if one chooses to keep @xmath395 constant from the beginning , irrespective how far @xmath77 has relaxed , one needs to require @xmath396 , resulting in a different proportionality @xmath397 to be inserted into the equations of motion .",

    "since the stress distribution in the experiments of  @xcite is rather nonuniform , there will always be some areas with a shear stress close to @xmath222 . and the system will tend to cave in there , resulting in a larger strain accumulation than what the average value for @xmath176 would predict .",
    "we also note that @xmath400 , observed to be density - independent in  @xcite , is correlated to the friction angle at high flow rates [ see the discussion above eq  ( [ midi ] ) ] , but postpone a detailed discussion to a future publication .    in the experiment ,",
    "a very soft spring was used to couple the fan and the motor .",
    "this we believe is an essential reason why this experiment turned out as observed .",
    "usually , triaxial apparatus with stiff walls are used . and the correcting rates employed by the feedback loop to keep the stress constant are of hypoplastic magnitudes .",
    "as a result , much @xmath1 is excited , and we have the situation of consecutive constant rates , rather than of that of constant stress .",
    "the soft spring , as discussed in sec  [ soft springs ] , enables quasi - static stress correction without exciting much @xmath1 .      in the last section",
    ", we discussed how an initial temperature @xmath389 and its associated shear rate @xmath401 relax , if the shear stress is hold constant at a value smaller than the critical one , @xmath402 .",
    "after the relaxation has completed , the system is in a static and mechanically stable state .",
    "the relaxation is slower the closer @xmath176 is to @xmath222 , becoming infinitely slow for @xmath403 , or equivalently , @xmath404 .",
    "then we have @xmath405 , @xmath406 , see eqs  ( [ 3b-7a],[3b-8a ] ) , with especially @xmath407 remaining a constant , see eq  ( [ 3b-10 ] ) .",
    "this is indistinguishable from the rate - controlled , stationary critical state , which we therefore deduce may be maintained at both given rate and stress .",
    "in addition , we note that mechanical stability is lost at @xmath403 for an elevated @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath9 , a granular assembly maintaining a static shear stress exceeding the critical value @xmath222 but not yet breaching the yield condition ( as given in sec .  [ yield surfaces ] ) is stable , though only precariously so : any @xmath1 sufficiently large , say caused by distant rumbling of the earth , will destabilize it .",
    "for @xmath408 , or @xmath409 , we have @xmath410 in eq  ( [ 3b-10 ] ) , and an initial granular temperature @xmath389 will become larger with time , until it diverges .",
    "this worsens the instability , and quickens the mechanical collapse , but it does not imply the general impossibility for static stress values larger than @xmath222 , because if the initial @xmath1 is too small , of quasi - static values , the factor @xmath411 of eq  ( [ 2c-5a ] ) is large , and with it also @xmath412 , see eq  ( [ 3b-4 ] ) .",
    "so the factor @xmath413 remains positive , and a small @xmath1 will relax rather than explode .",
    "if the initial @xmath1 is large enough , however , it will indeed grow , and with it also the shear rate @xmath209  though they will not diverge , because the system will leave the rate - independent , hypoplastic regime , invalidating the above calculation .",
    "the total stress then has a more general form including viscous terms , see eq  ( [ sum stress df ] ) , and eq  ( [ 3b-17 ] ) below .",
    "holding it constant at a value @xmath409 will again lead to a stationary state , with constant @xmath1 and @xmath209 .",
    "although the shear stress instability for @xmath414 holds only for stress - controlled experiments , not rate - controlled ones , the distinction is not always clear - cut in experiments .",
    "for instance , if a step motor is used , and one has a strain versus time curve such as given by fig  [ stepmotor ] , than the stress is being hold constant at the plateaus , rendering the stability of the uniform system fairly precarious even for a strain - controlled approach . this may well be the reason why shear band formation is so frequently observed in the case where the initial density is high and the non - monotonic stress trajectory exceeds @xmath222 , see fig  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we emphasize that this aspect of granular behavior comes out of gsh quite naturally , without us ever having put it there .",
    "it results from the interplay between yield and the critical state , or more precisely , between the instability of the elastic energy and the stationary solution of the elastic strain .",
    "this result does not hinge on any functional dependence of energy or transport coefficients , only on the general structure of gsh .",
    "it is noteworthy that by including a ambient temperature @xmath230 , as in sec  [ external perturbation ] , @xmath415,\\ ] ] see eq  ( [ sum t_g ] ) , shifts the equilibrium values @xmath1 and @xmath209 relax to , from 0 to @xmath416 making its effect more pronounced closer to @xmath351 , or as discussed above , @xmath222 . note that the second expression is algebraically identical to eq  ( [ 3b-8 ] ) .      in the last two sections , although the shear stress was controlled , the pressure was not .",
    "we took @xmath327 , a controlled rate , to keep the density constant and the calculation analytical .",
    "besides , keeping the shear strain @xmath139 constant is not executable experimentally , and we need to find an experimental prescription that is .",
    "we therefore revisit the situation  to understand what happens if both the pressure and shear stress are kept constant .",
    "though the general consideration does not appear analytically viable , one simple solution of a realistic situation exists : rewriting eqs  ( [ 2c-7],[2c-9 ] ) as @xmath417-(1-\\alpha)v_{\\ell\\ell } , \\\\\\label{3b-14 } \\partial_t u_s&=&(1-\\alpha)[v_t(u_s / u_c)-v_s],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and keeping constant @xmath418 , @xmath391 , we obtain @xmath419 taking a @xmath420 such that for given @xmath421 the bracket vanishes , and @xmath327 , implies constant density . inserting @xmath422 into the balance equation for @xmath1 , eq  ( [ sum t_g ] ) , we again obtain eq  ( [ 3b-9 ] ) with ( [ 3b-12 ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that there is now a clear prescription for the experiment , because constant @xmath423 means that pressure and shear stress are kept constant .",
    "so one may proceed experimentally by applying an arbitrary pressure , then varying the shear stress until the density no longer changes .",
    "@xmath1 will then as predicted be long - lived  infinitely so for @xmath403 , and exploding for @xmath409 . and",
    "no shear stress above @xmath222 is stable if @xmath1 is elevated .",
    "all visco - elastic systems such as polymers have a characteristic time @xmath424 that separates two frequency ranges : fluid - like behavior for @xmath425 , and solid - like one for @xmath426 . like granular media ,",
    "polymers are transiently elastic , though the transiency is constant and not variable .",
    "the hydrodynamic theory of polymers  @xcite , defining an elastic strain @xmath13 , and employing the equation @xmath427 is capable of accounting for many visco - elastic phenomena , including shear - thinning / thickening , elongational viscosity , the cox - merz rule , and the rod - climbing ( or weienberg ) effect .",
    "as compared to this equation , the granular version , eq  ( [ 2c-8 ] ) , has an extra coefficient @xmath428 , and its relaxation time varies as @xmath429 , with @xmath1 a dynamic variable .",
    "the first difference is not qualitative , as it only accounts for an overall softening .",
    "the second difference is crucial , because ( 1 )  the system is truly elastic when the relaxation time diverges for @xmath2 , and may sustain a shear stress statically .",
    "( that the static shear stress , as in the case of granular media , has a upper limit , is an extra complication not of primary concern here . ) ( 2 )  the relation @xmath430 gives rise rate - independence , while the constancy of @xmath431 divides the frequency into solid and liquid regimes .",
    "when there is , in granular media , an ambient temperature @xmath230 much larger than the @xmath1 produced by the imposed shear rate @xmath209 , or @xmath432 , @xmath433 , then polymers and granular media are naturally very similar in their behavior .",
    "( @xmath434 is the shear rate needed to produce the ambient temperature @xmath230 , see eq  ( [ v_t ] . )",
    "the ambient temperature @xmath230 may be maintained by periodic tapping , or is transported by diffusion from another region of great granular activity .",
    "the point is , @xmath230 enables relaxation of the elastic strain and stress for a static system , and implies a vanishing yield stress .      in granular media , one frequently observes a shear band , with a boundary between the stationary solid and and the shearing fluid part .",
    "more careful experiments ( see komatsu et al  @xcite , crassous et al  @xcite , and references therein ) , however , reveals that the transition is not discontinuous , and an exponentially decaying creep motion takes place in the solid . to understand this within the framework of gsh",
    ", we first note that granular temperature being produced in the fluid region will diffuse into the solid one , and is present there as an ambient temperature , enabling stress relaxation .",
    "this implies a compensating shear rate if the stress is to be maintained .",
    "the velocity obtained from integrating the shear rate is the observed creep motion .",
    "the ambient temperature will decay in space , so will the compensating shear rate .",
    "circumstances are in fact quite similar to that of sec  [ aging ] , though we need to consider stationary but spatially nonuniform states here : the shear rate needed to compensate stress relaxation is still as given by eq  ( [ 3b-7a ] ) ; instead of eq  ( [ 3b-8a ] ) , we take @xmath390 ; the balance equation for @xmath1 lacks the term @xmath435 but contains the diffusive current , see eq  ( [ sum t_g ] ) , @xmath436\\,h^2t_g\\equiv t_g / b^2.\\ ] ] so the decay of @xmath437 is , for an one - dimensional variation along @xmath438 , exponential . because of eq  ( [ 3b-7a ] ) , the decay of the shear rate and velocity is also exponential , with the same characteristic length @xmath439 . that the decay length diverges for @xmath403 should not surprise , because the solid region ceases to exist then .",

    "an striking phenomenon  discovered by nichol et al .",
    "@xcite , and followed up by reddy et al .",
    "@xcite in a geometry more amenable to systematic evaluation , is the so - called _ non - local fluidization _ of granular media . in a vessel containing grains ,",
    "after a shear band is turned on , the medium everywhere , even further away from the band , looses its yield stress , and the archimedes law is observed to hold : a ball that was stuck at whatever height without the shear band starts to sink or elevate , depending on its density , until it is equal to the granular density .",
    "the explanation within the framework of gsh is : a ball getting stuck in sand builds up an elastic shear stress @xmath140 and the associated elastic strain @xmath139 around itself . without an ambient temperature , @xmath441 , this stress holds up the ball s weight if it is not too large , and the ball is stationary . but with one , strain and stress relax , and the ball starts to move  a striking demonstration of the yield stress vanishing .",
    "once the ball is in motion , the elastic strain rate will quickly become stationary in the rest frame of the ball , @xmath442 , reaching a balance between the deformation rate @xmath295 and the relaxation @xmath443 , or @xmath444 , see eq  ( [ 3b-7a ] ) . replacing @xmath139 with @xmath445 in the shear stress @xmath446",
    ", we turn the elastic stress surrounding the ball into a viscous one , @xmath447 .",
    "if @xmath209 is small enough , we may expand in it , and this viscous stress is linear in the shear flow , @xmath448 .",
    "granular media are then newtonian fluids , with a viscosity @xmath449 .",
    "this is the basic gsh - explanation , though a word of caution is appropriate here : any hydrodynamic theory starts from the assumption that the resolution of the theory ( `` pixel size '' ) is small compared to system size , but much larger than any micro- and mesoscopic lengths  in the present case , especially the grain diameter @xmath450 . in  @xcite ,",
    "the diameter of the probing rod is only @xmath451 .",
    "one may hope that averaging over time and runs will restore the macroscopic limit , but this is far from certain when the two scales are that close .",

    "these models yield , in circumstances where they hold , a realistic account of the complex elasto - plastic motion , providing us with highly condensed and intelligently organized empirical data .",
    "this enables us to validate gsh and reduce the latitude in specifying the energy and transport coefficients .    at the same time , one needs to be aware of their drawbacks , especially the more hidden ones .",
    "first of all is the apparent freedom in fixing @xmath461  constrained only by the data one considers , not by energy conservation or entropy production that were crucial in deriving gsh .",
    "this is what we believe the main reason why there are so many competing engineering models .",
    "worse , this liberty explodes when one includes gradient terms .",
    "so most models refrain from the attempt to account for nonuniform situations , say elastic waves .",
    "second , in dispensing with the variables @xmath1 and @xmath13 , and choosing the shortcut via @xmath462 , one reduces the model s range of validity and looses the benefit of @xmath13 s simple behavior : first , the models of hypoplasticity and barodesy are valid only for @xmath220 , so a @xmath1 that is either too small or oscillates too fast will invalidate these models , as will a @xmath1 derived from an external source , such as considered in sec  [ external perturbation ] .",
    "second , as the analytical solution of the approach to the critical state in sec  [ approach critical ] shows , considering @xmath13  though it is not directly measurable  is a highly simplifying intermediate step .",
    "the case for @xmath13 is even stronger , when considering proportional paths and the barodesy model .",
    "the _ hypoplastic model _ starts from the postulated , rate - independent constitutive relation , @xmath463 where @xmath464 are ( fairly involved ) functions of the stress and packing fraction  @xcite .",
    "incremental nonlinearity as discussed in sec  [ load and unload ] is also part of the postulate .",
    "the simulated granular response is realistic for deformations at constant rates .",
    "gsh reduces to the hypoplastic model in the hypoplastic regime , for @xmath220 , @xmath465 , @xmath466 .",

    "if the shear experiment is not executed at given density , but rather at given pressure @xmath554 , circumstances are more complicated .",

    "the rate dependence in pressure controlled experiments hinges on the density dependence of the transport coefficients , which combine to form @xmath221 and @xmath32 .",
    "third , @xmath176 and the friction angle are , as observed in  @xcite , no longer necessarily monotonous functions of the shear rate @xmath209 . in this context , it is important to realize that in a nonuniform geometry , keeping the volume constant does not usually maintain a constant density .",
    "so a non - monotonic relation between @xmath176 and @xmath543 may also happen for constant volume , especially if the shear rate is strongly nonuniform .",
    "to better understand the last point , consider two uniform subvolumes ( instead of the continuous non - uniformity of the experiments ) .",
    "they are in contact via a flexible membrane , such that their total volume @xmath558 is a constant .",
    "initially , the total system is uniform , with both densities equal , @xmath559 , and both shear rates vanishing , @xmath560 .",
    "now , if @xmath561 is cranked up , but @xmath562 remains zero , because @xmath563 , the density must change and the membrane will stretch in one direction , typically with @xmath564 decreasing and @xmath565 increasing . if system  1 is much larger than 2 , the stretching of the membrane will not change @xmath565 much , as a result , @xmath566 will remain essentially constant .",
    "so will @xmath567 . as a result",
    ", the pressure - controlled limit holds .",
    "more realistically , if both systems are comparable in size , an intermediate case between the pressure- and density - controlled limit will take place .",
    "as only in the strictly density - controlled limit do we have monotonicity of the shear stress , any inhomogeneity in the shear rate may result in non - monotonic behavior of the shear stress .",
    "first , we compare gsh to the continuum theory that boquet et al .  @xcite developed to account for their experiment , see also  @xcite .",
    "the theory includes the cauchy stress @xmath568 , and a balance equation for the temperature @xmath569 [ see eq  ( [ 2b-2c ] ) ] . for @xmath327 , they are : @xmath570 comparing these to the above dense flow expressions of eqs  ( [ sum t_g],[sum stress df ] ) , we find agreement except for the fact that the elastic contributions @xmath571 are missing .",
    "next , we compare gsh to the midi constitutive relations . starting from the postulate that granular rheology in dense flows",
    "is controlled by the dimensionless parameter of inertial number , @xmath572 , pouliquen et al .",
    "distilled two locally applicable constitutive relations from experiments and simulations , for the density and the friction angle @xmath573 , see  @xcite , @xmath574 identifying @xmath575 , the first relation may be combined to form @xmath576 , same as eq  ( [ midi ] ) if @xmath221 is neglected .",
    "this is to be expected , because the inertial number @xmath577 ( as savage observed  @xcite ) does not contain any elastic information .",
    "the second expression is similar to eq  ( [ 3b-18 ] ) , and it does contain elastic contributions , because we may identify @xmath578 , and @xmath579 .",
    "the transition between the two friction angles is linear in the reduced shear rate @xmath577 , not quadratic as in gsh , though this is as mentioned a subtle difference , see fig  [ midi ] .",
    "comparison of the midi constitutive relations with gsh . ]    more troubling is the claim that eqs  ( [ 3b-20 ] ) are valid for pressure controlled experiments , not volume controlled ones  implying that the friction angle @xmath580 tends to a constant for large shear rates .",
    "in contrast , gsh contends that it behaves as @xmath581 , see eq  ( [ 3b-18a ] ) .",
    "it is generally a constant only if the rate dependence of @xmath582 cancels that of @xmath543  universally . as mentioned above",
    ", density dependence of transport coefficients do vary .",
    "so we expect the friction angle to display a more diverse behavior , and may even diverge .",
    "on the other hand , the majority of experiments cited in  @xcite are inhomogeneous , with varying shear rate and density , so controlling the volume does not mean holding the local density constant . in princinple , of course ,",
    "gsh is capable of dealing with these situations  though before ons can solve this set of partial differential equations for given boundary conditions , we need to have clarified the density dependence of all transport coefficients .      considering shallow flows on an inclined plane and rotating drums , aranson and tsimring identified the hysteresis of transition , or the delay between jamming and fluidization , as a key feature of granular behavior  @xcite",
    "their theory takes the stress @xmath568 as the sum of two parts , one solid - like , @xmath583 , and a rate - dependent fluid one .",
    "@xmath584 is an order parameter that is 1 for granular solid , and 0 for dense flow .",
    "the authors take the friction angle @xmath585 , differently than above , as the ratio of the solid stress components , rather than the total ones , and postulate a free energy @xmath586 such that @xmath587 is unstable for large friction angles , @xmath588 ; while @xmath589 is unstable for a small ones , @xmath590 .",
    "but both are stable in the intermediate region , @xmath591 .",
    "( @xmath592 and @xmath593 are referred to as the angle of stability and repose , respectively . )",
    "though this theory does not consider variations in @xmath36 or @xmath1 , and takes the solid stress @xmath14 as an input from some other theory , it provides a pivotal insight : the viability , even appropriateness , of using a partially bistable energy to account for the hysteresis .",
    "turning now to gsh , we first note that for rate - controlled experiments in the hypoplastic regime , there is no hysteresis , only uniform and continuous paths to the ideally plastic , critical state and back , all given by eqs  ( [ 3b-17 ] ) , with the terms @xmath594 evident only at higher rates .",
    "the second type of fluidization takes place either at quasi - static rates or stress - controlled .",
    "it is discontinuous , and happens because a yield surface is breached  say when the ratio @xmath595 is larger than @xmath596 , see  eq  ( [ 2b-3 ] ) .",
    "this is what we consider now .    on a plane inclined by a slowly increasing angle @xmath585 , with @xmath597",

    "note both @xmath607 are functions of @xmath36 , the value of which varying with @xmath597 is not always fixed .",
    "but the ratio @xmath608 ( a function of @xmath609 ) is density independent , see the discussion below eq  ( [ 3b-5 ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two angles is clearly a question of @xmath1 , with @xmath2 in the first , and elevated in the second , case .",
    "we have @xmath610 , because the critical state is only realized and defined , if the yield surface is not breached in an approach to the critical state .",
    "compaction  a slow increase of the density at given pressure when the system is perturbed  is a ubiquitous phenomenon in granular media , though not a universal one .",
    "for instance , the density is observed to both in- and decrease approaching the critical state . within the framework of gsh",
    ", compaction stems from the basic fact that the elastic compression @xmath77 relaxes in the presence of @xmath1 . keeping the pressure constant",
    ", the density must increase to compensate for the diminishing @xmath77 .",
    "this is also the case approaching the critical state , though with the difference that , in addition to the relaxation that reduces @xmath77 , the applied shear rate @xmath209 increases it  consider eq  ( [ 2c-7 ] ) , or @xmath611 . in approaching the critical state ,",
    "@xmath612 , @xmath77 may in- or decrease , depending how large @xmath613 are at any moment , see sec  [ pressure approach ] .",
    "consider the pressure @xmath614 assuming vanishing shear rate , @xmath615 , with @xmath114 the elastic , and @xmath51 the seismic , contribution , see eqs  ( [ 2b-2b],[2b-4],[3b-17 ] ) , @xmath616 where both @xmath617 and @xmath51 are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath36 .",
    "so the density must get larger when @xmath77 decreases .",
    "it is irreversible because the relaxation of @xmath77 is .    at small @xmath1 ,",
    "the relaxation of @xmath77 is slow , and the seismic pressure @xmath51 may be neglected .",

    ", the seismic pressure must be included . then the relaxation of @xmath77 for given @xmath1 increases @xmath51 and decreases @xmath114 , such that @xmath614 remains constant . after the relaxation of @xmath618",
    "has run its course , with @xmath619 , if one modifies @xmath1 but maintains @xmath620 , the density will change in response , in both directions and hence reversibly .",
    "note this is where the fluid equilibrium condition eq  ( [ 2a-2 ] ) , obtained by maximizing the true entropy , holds .",
    "consequently , the relaxation of @xmath77 occurs because it increases the entropy .",
    "changing @xmath1 midway at constant @xmath102 , with @xmath77 still finite , will mainly lead to a change in @xmath77 , because the density responds much more slowly .",
    "it disrupts the relaxation of @xmath77 , in essence resetting its initial condition .",
    "this phenomenon was observed in  @xcite and interpreted as a memory effect . generally speaking , ",
    "memory \" is usually a result of hidden variables : when the system behaves differently in two cases , although all state variables appear to have the same values , we speak of memory- , or history - dependence .",
    "but an overlooked variable that has different values for the two cases will naturally explain the difference . in the case of compaction , the manifest and hidden variables are @xmath36 and @xmath77 , respectively .",

    "_  @xcite .",
    "the entropy @xmath621 is obtained by counting the number of possibilities to package grains stably for a given volume , equating it to @xmath625 .",
    "compaction is taken as an indication of an increasing @xmath621 .",
    "two reasons prompt us to doubt its appropriateness .",
    "first , the number of possibilities to arrange grains concerns inter - granular degrees of freedom .",
    "these are vastly overwhelmed by the much more numerous configurations of the inner - granular degrees of freedom .",
    "in other words , the edward entropy @xmath621 is a special case of the granular entropy @xmath6 , and as discussed in sec  [ intro-3 ] , we always have @xmath626 .",
    "_ in equilibrium , where eq  ( [ 2a-2 ] ) holds , the entropy @xmath7 is maximal , and macroscopic energy minimal .",
    "_ this is unrelated to the number of possibilities to package grains .",
    "one would be able to neglect @xmath7 and concentrate on @xmath6 if these two were only weakly connected , if the energy decay from @xmath6 to @xmath7 were exceedingly slow .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the relaxation of @xmath4 or @xmath1 , via inelastic scattering , is a fast process .",
    "second , even assuming a weak coupling between @xmath7 and @xmath6 , the edward entropy @xmath621 would , as defined , still not be a relevant measure : the actual starting point of the edward entropy is the assumption that @xmath6 does not depend on the energy @xmath622 , which is always zero for infinitely rigid , non - interacting grains at rest , however they are packaged .",
    "taking the entropy generally as a function of energy and volume , @xmath627 , we have , quite generally , @xmath628 usually , one keeps the volume constant , @xmath629 , and consider the conventional expression , @xmath630 . taking instead @xmath631 , we have @xmath632 , equivalent to the edward expression @xmath633 .",
    "this construction ignores three essential points : first , perturbing the system , allowing it to explore the phase space , introduces kinetic energy that one must include . then clearly , @xmath634 .",
    "second , because of the hertz - like contact between grains , little material is deformed at first contact , and the compressibility diverges at vanishing compression .",
    "this is a geometric fact independent of how rigid the bulk material is .",
    "therefore , infinite rigidity is never a realistic limit in granular media , and there is always considerable elastic energy stored among grains in mechanically stable agglomerates  even at finite perturbation , as long as @xmath77 is not zero .",
    "finally , @xmath621 as defined is the granular entropy at vanishing granular motion and compression .",
    "its phase space is therefore severely constrained . generally speaking",
    ", each classical particle has states in a 6d - space , three for positions and three for the velocities .",
    "@xmath635 is the number of states times the loschmidt s number ; @xmath636 is the number of states times the number of grains , and @xmath637 is the number of states in 3d space ( no velocities ) times the number of grains .",
    "therefore @xmath638 going toward equilibrium , a system searches for the greatest number of states to equally redistribute its energy .",
    "one bears the burden of proof for the claim that it is sensible for the system to neglect @xmath7 and concentrate on @xmath621 . in contrast",
    ", gsh identifies compaction as a process taking place at finite @xmath1 and compares the true entropy @xmath7 of macrostates at that @xmath1 .",
    "it also accounts for entropy increase , by detailing how macroscopic energy decays into granular heat , and how this is converted to true heat .",
    "reversible and irreversible compaction as accounted for by gsh is a universal granular phenomenon .",
    "it occurs at given pressure and @xmath1 , however @xmath1 is created .",
    "at the same time , numerous experiments show that tapping , though especially efficient , is but one way to achieve compaction , leading to results similar to that of other methods  @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to take the consideration of the last section to hold for tapping as well",
    ". this should be true for gentle tapping , but the connection to stronger ones warrants further scrutiny .",
    "gentle tapping leads to granular jiggling and a small @xmath1 , though one that fluctuates in time , with periodic flare - ups .",
    "as long as @xmath51 may be neglected , @xmath77 will relax according to the momentary value of @xmath1 , haltingly but monotonically .",
    "since the relaxation is a slow process , one could average over many taps to yield a coarse - grained account . given a granular column with a free upper surface in the gravitational field , because a given layer is subject to a constant pressure",
    ", the density will increase to compensate for the diminishing @xmath77 .",
    "the characteristic time of @xmath77-relaxation diverges towards the end , and is not a constant , see  @xcite .",
    "stronger tapping leads to a higher @xmath1 , with @xmath77 relaxing more quickly .",
    "@xmath51 must now be included .",
    "periodically , when all grains are at rest , @xmath51 vanishes , and @xmath77 is necessarily increased to maintain the given pressure .",
    "this introduces a non - monotonicity into @xmath316 , and raises the question , whether the system , when again at an elevated @xmath1 , will pick up the relaxation of @xmath77 where it was left when the system last crushed to a stop . and",
    "why it should do so .",
    "if it does , we can again take tapping as coarse - grainable , intermittent compaction . then , and only then , does gsh provide an understanding for tapping  though this will be a transparent , conventional and demystified one .",
    "a shear band is in its essence the coexistence of static granular solid and uniform dense flow .",
    "in the first , the grains are deformed and at rest , @xmath9 , with all energy being elastic . in the second , the grains jiggle , rattle , move macroscopic distances , with @xmath499 and a portion of the energy in @xmath1 .",
    "the transition from the rate - independent critical state to the bagnold regime of uniform dense flow as the shear rate @xmath209 increases go via two different paths , either gradual and uniform , as discussed in sec  [ udf ] ; or discontinuous and nonuniform , via shear bands .    approaching the critical state with a high initial density , the evolution of the shear stress @xmath176 is non - monotonic , assuming values temporarily larger than @xmath222 .",
    "this is where the system has a high probability of breaching an instability , either of the elastic energy at a point on the yield surface , as discussed in sec  [ yield surfaces ] , or that of @xmath1 , as discussed in sec  [ scs ] .",
    "the breaching of the elastic energy will happen with certainty if the system is slowly sheared in the quasi - elastic regime .",
    "after the breach , the density and elastic strain quickly become inhomogeneous , because their fluctuations grow exponentially .",
    "this goes on until a stable state compatible with the boundary conditions is found again  such as one with a shear band , consisting of a low - density fluid region in the shear band , and a high density solid region outside .",
    "the chaotic transition is difficult to account for , but the stable shear band is again simple .",
    "as we shall see , the shear band has a minimal and constant width at a low shearing velocity @xmath268 .",

    ", the width @xmath639 grows linearly with @xmath268 , implying a constant rate @xmath640 in the liquid phase . as a result , the shear stress ,",
    "a function of the rate , remains independent of @xmath268 .",
    "faux rate - independence _ goes on until the band covers the whole system , at which point the quadratic rate dependence of uniform dense flow sets in .",
    "for given volume , the band width remains independent of @xmath268 , but the shear stress grows quadratically with it .",
    "the transition to uniform dense flow is again discontinuous .",
    "it happens when the shear stress exceeds the critical value of the solid density , at which point the solid phase is no longer stable .    to account for the shear band , we connect the fluid and solid solutions already considered employing a set of simple connecting conditions . denoting the solid and fluid parts respectively with the superscripts @xmath641 and @xmath642 ,",
    "the conditions are the equality of the pressure , shear stress , and chemical potential , @xmath643 [ the chemical potential is defined as @xmath644 , eq  ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the equality holds because otherwise a particle current would flow across the phase boundary .",
    "] all three fields have an elastic and a seismic contribution , eqs  ( [ 2c-2],[2c-2a ] ) . with @xmath614 , @xmath645 , they are @xmath646 \\\\\\label{5 - 7d } p_t&\\equiv & { a\\rho t_g^2}/2({\\rho_c/\\rho-1 } ) , \\\\\\label{5 - 7 } \\mu_t&\\equiv&t_g^2\\,\\frac b2\\frac{(1+a)\\rho-\\rho_{cp}}{\\rho_{cp}-\\rho } , \\\\\\mu_\\delta&\\equiv&\\frac{0.15w_\\delta } { \\rho_{cp}-\\rho}\\,\\,\\frac{\\rho_{cp}-\\bar\\rho } { \\rho-\\bar\\rho},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition to @xmath647 , also with two parts . denoting the width of the shear band as @xmath639 , and the velocity difference across the shear band as @xmath268 , we assume @xmath648 in other words , the elastic strain @xmath77 and @xmath139 have critical values in the @xmath649-phase , and appropriate static values in the @xmath7-phase . strictly speaking , the discontinuities at the @xmath650 boundary are in @xmath651 , but not the shear rate , which decays exponentially in @xmath7 , as a result of @xmath1-diffusion , see sec  [ creep motion ] .",
    "we neglect this detail in the qualitative discussion below .",
    "the elastic contribution @xmath652 is a very small quantity : in @xmath653 , a large @xmath129 compensates a small @xmath654 , such that @xmath114 is either much larger than , or comparable to , @xmath56 .",
    "now , @xmath655 is of the order of @xmath656 , but @xmath657 is smaller by the factor @xmath77 , around @xmath658 .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath659 , we have @xmath660 , and @xmath661 reduces to @xmath662 , implying the density in the shear band is fixed , @xmath663 measuring this density therefore yields the value of @xmath80 [ that is important in calibrating the energy contribution of granular entropy , see eq  ( [ 2b-5 ] ) ] .",
    "note that given @xmath664 , the elastic pressure @xmath114 is also known , because @xmath665 .",
    "next , we confine the discussion to the case of given external pressure , @xmath666 and given velocity difference @xmath268 across the shear band .",
    "this is an intriguing case , because @xmath667 and @xmath664 fix both @xmath1 and the shear rate @xmath668 .",
    "given in addition @xmath268 , the width @xmath639 of the shear band is also fixed .",
    "these are all there is to be known about the fluid region . especially the pressure and the shear stress",
    "are given as @xmath669 remarkably , the system now displays a faux rate - independence : @xmath639 adjusts itself such that @xmath670 remains constant for given pressure , independent what @xmath268 is .",
    "the parabola of fig  [ fig4 ] depicts @xmath176 .",
    "the offset gives the elastic contributions , @xmath222 .",
    "the horizontal line is a result of @xmath639 adjusting .",
    "it is indeed easy to mistake a shear band for the uniform , critical state .     as functions of the velocity difference @xmath268 for given pressure , in a simple - shear geometry .",
    "the offset gives the elastic contribution , @xmath671 ; the parabola is the case without a shear band .",
    "the thick horizontal line depicts the situation with a shear band , of width @xmath639 , which is smaller towards left , and equal to the system s width @xmath672 at the right end .",
    "the rate - independence of @xmath176 derived from @xmath639 adjusting itself such that @xmath670 remains constant for given pressure .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    increasing the velocity @xmath268 at given pressure alters the width @xmath639 , as long as it is smaller than the width of the total system @xmath672 . for larger velocities ,",
    "the system is again uniform , without a solid region .",
    "and the consideration of sec  [ udf ] holds . until this point ,",
    "the stress is rate - independent , much longer than without a shear band .",
    "given the solid density @xmath673 ( which is fixed by the dynamics , see sec  [ sr ] ) and the mass per unit length @xmath674 , mass conservation @xmath675 determines the total width @xmath672 for given pressure @xmath102 .      at given total volume @xmath672 ,",
    "the behavior is quite different .",
    "first , because of mass conservation , @xmath676 and because @xmath677 are given in addition to @xmath672 , the band width @xmath639 is fixed , irrespective what the velocity @xmath268 is . as a result ,",
    "both the shear stress and pressure grow as @xmath678 , not at all rate - independent .",
    "the transition to uniform dense flow happens when eq  ( [ 94 ] ) is violated , for @xmath679 .",
    "the solid region is , in comparison , less fixed .",
    "the reason is we have the three connecting conditions of eq  ( [ 3b-21 ] ) , and three quantities to be determined , @xmath680 . yet , because terms are of such different magnitudes in @xmath661 , it fixes @xmath664 instead of giving a relation between @xmath664 and @xmath673 .",
    "so it is always satisfied , irrespective what value @xmath673 assumes .",
    "therefore , @xmath673 can only be a result of the dynamics : when an instability is breached , the density is changed until it gets stuck at some value for @xmath673 , at which the system is again stable . then of course , @xmath681 may be determined for given pressure and shear stress . nevertheless , we do know @xmath682 must hold .",
    "the first inequality can be seen from @xmath683 the first greater sign is related to the discussion in sec  [ scs ] ; the equal sign is one connecting condition ; and the second greater sign is a result of @xmath684 being positive , in addition to the fact that @xmath222 is a monotonically increasing function of the density , cf .",
    "the discussion below eq  ( [ 3b-5 ] ) .",
    "the second inequality , @xmath685 , holds for given external pressure @xmath102 , and comes from the following consideration : in the critical state , there is only one free parameter .",
    "once @xmath36 is given , @xmath686 also are .",
    "alternatively , one may fix the external pressure @xmath687 , then @xmath688 is a dependent quantity . in the shear band , because the density @xmath664 is already fixed , the elastic pressure @xmath689 will in general be different from the external one , @xmath690 , and the difference is taken up by the seismic term @xmath51 . since @xmath51 is always positive , we have @xmath691 , implying the external pressure has to be so large that @xmath685 holds .",
    "otherwise , shear band can not exist , and the flow is uniform .      when the velocity @xmath268 decreases , the above consideration stops to be valid at some point . for instance ,",
    "@xmath664 is no longer given if @xmath659 does not hold .",
    "more importantly , the width @xmath639 will decrease with @xmath268 ( for given pressure ) only as long as @xmath639 is larger than a few grain diameter .",
    "when @xmath268 decreases further , @xmath639 can not follow , and will remain at a minimal width . to account for this",
    ", we need the consideration ( as yet quite qualitative ) given below .",
    "the phenomenon of clogging implies that a free surface , if small enough , may be stable even when facing downward , with a friction angle of up to @xmath692 , much larger than the coulomb yield angle .",
    "similarly , shear bands have a a finite width in the limit of vanishing velocities",
    ". both are phenomena not accounted for by gsh as given above .",
    "this is connected to the fact that hydrodynamic theories are only capable of accounting for spatial variations much larger than the correlation length  in the case of gsh especially the grain diameter .",
    "nevertheless , there is a tried and proven method of qualitatively accounting for small scale effects such that blatant inconsistencies are avoided .",
    "( it has been employed eg . for the superfluid transition by including the gradient terms of the order parameter s magnitude  @xcite . )    in our case , we include higher - order gradient terms @xmath693 in the energy that express the extra cost of a nonuniform strain field .",
    "a length scale on which elastic strains will change is thus introduced . note non - uniform strain fields necessarily exist at the liquid - solid interface , and an infinitely narrow shear band is the result of setting the length of strain change to zero .",
    "similarly , a non - uniform strain field of the size of the hole s diameter is needed for unclogging .",
    "because of momentum conservation , @xmath694 , the stress stays constant in one - dimensional geometries , even across a shear shear band .",
    "therefore , higher order gradient terms in the stress would not do the job . including higher order gradient terms in strain rates",
    "would also miss the point that a static inhomogeneity of granular deformation costs extra energy and is therefore capped  @xcite .",
    "the lack of a length scale in describing shear bands is a known problem in soil mechanics .",
    "one popular method to introduce it is by adding state variables that account for the couple stress and the crosserat rotation , see eg .",
    "including additional variables for the sole purpose of solving our present problem , however , does seem unwarranted as it leads to a far more complex theory .",
    "starting with an addition to the elastic energy @xmath695 and introducing the conjugate variable @xmath696 , the elastic stress obtains additional terms of the type @xmath697 in a shear band of width @xmath639 , we therefore expect an additional pressure contribution @xmath698 , which is to be compared with @xmath699 .",
    "defining @xmath249 such that @xmath700 , and @xmath401 such that @xmath701 , where @xmath401 is a function of the elastic strain and its difference at the interface , the total pressure @xmath702 is @xmath703 as long as @xmath268 is fast enough for @xmath639 to be larger than , say , 30 grain diameter , @xmath704 may be neglected , and the results of the last sections is recovered .",
    "but in the vicinity of a few grain diameter , it becomes dominant , and fixes the band width to a value independent of @xmath268 . as shear bands",
    "are usually observed to be narrow and rate independent , experiments are probably typically in this limit . a constant pressure contribution @xmath705 will also stabilize a free surface of diameter @xmath639 that is sufficiently small  a subject that we shall consider elsewhere , along with a more quantitative consideration of shear bands",
