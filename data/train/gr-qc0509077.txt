    "in general relativity the volume of some region in space depends on how spacetime is sliced into a spatial part and time .",
    "this is unsatisfactory insofar as it appears to prohibit a meaningful definition of the volume of black holes ( bhs ) and thus to quantify the ratio between the entropy as expected naively from quantum field theory  which grows with the volume because entropy is an extensive quantity  and the bekenstein - hawking entropy as derived from the laws of bh mechanics  which grows with the area of the bh .    in ref .",
    "@xcite m.  parikh has provided a slicing - invariant definition for the volume of stationary black holes .",
    "moreover , he could show that for dimension @xmath1 and @xmath2 the volume can never be infinite if the area is finite , which led to interesting possible implications for the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "it has been pointed out as well that in @xmath3 there may be loopholes which , in principle , could allow to circumvent these nogo results . the case @xmath0 has not been addressed .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to extend such a discussion to @xmath0 .",
    "section [ se:2 ] provides the definition and treats several examples . in section [ se:3 ] the question is addressed whether a bh with finite area might have infinite volume .",
    "section [ se:4 ] concludes with a brief discussion .",

    "the dimensionless scalar field @xmath9 often is called `` dilaton field '' . in the present work semi - positivity",
    "will be assumed , @xmath10 . to avoid confusion",
    "it should be noted that in string literature almost exclusively the dilaton field @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 is used instead of @xmath9 .",
    "the dimensionless functions @xmath13 define the model , which may or may not exhibit bh solutions",
    ". the scaling constant @xmath14 with length dimension minus one will play no role in the present work . the numerical overall constant @xmath15 will be kept for the time being .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath16 the additive ambiguity inherent to this definition may be fixed conveniently .",
    "physically it corresponds to the freedom to choose the unit of mass .",
    "all classical solutions of yield a line element that may be brought into the following form : @xmath17 prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath18 . by inspection",
    ", there is always a killing vector @xmath19 . up to different notations for signature",
    "this coincides with the @xmath20 part of the line element considered in ref .",
    "different choices of the function @xmath21 correspond to different time - slicings .",
    "the transformation @xmath22 , @xmath23 puts into eddington - finkelstein gauge , @xmath24 this coincides with the general solution of , eq .",
    "( 3.24 ) of @xcite ( up to minor notational differences ; cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "the constant of motion appearing in , denoted by @xmath25 , is related to the adm mass ( whenever this notion makes sense ) .",
    "the function @xmath26 contains an additive ambiguity which may be fixed , for instance , by defining the ground state solution @xmath27 to be minkowski space or a bps solution ( whenever such solutions exist ) .",
    "the function @xmath28 in is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "thus , killing horizons are determined either by zeros of @xmath28 or by the equation @xmath30 .",
    "henceforth exclusively the line element will be enga(u)ged .",
    "the determinant of the spacetime metric has no dependence on the time slicing , @xmath31 and thus analogy to @xcite suggests a volume definition of the form @xmath32 .",
    "however , one can easily see that such a volume definition would be inappropriate for thermodynamical considerations , which have been a key motivation in @xcite : the euclidean action  and thus also free energy , the partition function and entropy  scale with the dilaton field because the curvature scalar in the action is multiplied by @xmath9 .",
    "also the gibbons - hawking boundary term is multiplied under the integrand by this factor .",
    "therefore , one ought to consider the dilaton field as being part of the measure .",
    "before providing our proposal for the definition of the volume the one for the area is recalled : @xmath33 again , the reasoning is the same as above : area , which in 2d gravity actually is zero - dimensional , should scale with the dilaton field in order to be consistent with the bekenstein - hawking relation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the thermodynamical entropy of a 2d bh and @xmath36 the area evaluated at the bh horizon .",
    "entropy has been calculated in @xcite by simple thermodynamical considerations invoking the first law and also by wald s noether charge technique . translated to our notation",
    "the result is in is divided by @xmath37 , which in our convention equals unity . as a consequence @xmath38 . ] @xmath39 as a consistency check one may consider the schwarzschild bh ( sbh ) . because @xmath40 is just the volume of the angular part that has been integrated out to obtain and @xmath41 ,",
    "the normalization in is seen to be correct . for dimensionally reduced models",
    "the emergence of the dilaton field in the measure is not surprising .",
    "leads to a line element @xmath42 , the determinant of which is determined by @xmath43 . ] but also from an intrinsically 2d point of view the appearance of the dilaton field in is not unexpected if one keeps in mind that @xmath9 is essentially the ( space - time dependent ) inverse newton coupling .",
    "thus , the volume in 2d dilaton gravity will be defined by @xmath44 the overall normalization @xmath45 will be chosen later conveniently .",
    "one may absorb @xmath45 in the integration constant of , but we will refrain from doing so and assume the latter already being fixed by selecting a mass scale . for bhs we have to integrate from some lower value to the horizon . inserting the adapted coordinates",
    "establishes @xmath46 the quantity @xmath47 is the dilaton field evaluated at the killing horizon ( defined by @xmath30 ) , while @xmath48 is the lowest possible value the dilaton field may take inside the horizon .",
    "typically , @xmath49 will coincide with the locus of a curvature singularity . in many cases",
    "@xmath50 is valid .    for a large class of models @xmath51 holds , in particular for the so - called @xmath52-family of models ( cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "@xcite and section 3.3 in @xcite ) , @xmath53 inserting this into the definition yields @xmath54 and @xmath55 note that the last case is very special insofar as neither @xmath50 nor @xmath56 yield a finite volume , irrespective of the area .",
    "this issue will be addressed in section [ se:3 ] .",
    "let us now study some examples explicitly ( always setting @xmath50 ) .",
    "[ [ schwarzschild - bh ] ] schwarzschild bh + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    first of all the spherically reduced sbh , @xmath57 , will be treated . in this case",
    "the dilaton field is essentially the surface area . by adjusting @xmath14 in appropriately one",
    "may achieve @xmath41 , where @xmath18 is the surface radius .",
    "if @xmath58 plugging these values into gives @xmath59 this coincides with the corresponding equation in @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that without the dilaton field in the definition it would have been impossible to obtain .",

    "thus , the volume reads @xmath62 recalling that the surface radius is related to the dilaton via @xmath63 and that the properly normalized action implies @xmath64 the bh area , eq .  , is seen to be correct .",

    "thus , the volume scales quadratically with the area and hence with entropy .",
    "the most prominent member belonging to this class is the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite , the solutions of which are @xmath70 .",
    "[ [ witten - bh ] ] witten bh + + + + + + + + +    finally , we address the witten bh @xcite , which has @xmath71 . from and",
    "the ratio @xmath72 is seen to be independent from the dilaton field .",
    "thus , for the witten bh the area is proportional to the volume of the bh , with some fixed proportionality constant .",
    "it may be set to unity by choosing @xmath73 .",

    "they do not leave invariant the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 . indeed",
    ", it is always possible to eliminate the kinetic term in by transforming to a different , conformally related , model .",
    "thus , also the definition of the volume obviously depends on the choice of the conformal frame .",
    "we ask now the question : is it possible to obtain an infinite volume while keeping the area bounded from above ? obviously , for finite values of @xmath47 this is impossible . on the other hand , @xmath76 would blow up the area .",
    "thus , the only candidate is the limit @xmath77 .",
    "as can be seen from for @xmath78 also the volume shrinks to zero .",
    "however , for @xmath79 the volume diverges .",
    "is it therefore possible in @xmath0 to obtain infinite volume with zero area without encountering any pathologies ?    the answer is no . to understand this one has to consider the global structure carefully .",
    "there is a non - rigorous shortcut : the definition suggests to take @xmath56 rather than @xmath50 .",
    "so the `` outside observer '' would be located near @xmath80 rather than near @xmath81 .",
    "but then it is not surprising that the limit @xmath82 yields an infinite volume ",
    "after all , the volume calculated in this manner is the _ total _ volume of spacetime .",
    "however , this scenario would imply that the area of the `` asymptotic region '' vanishes rather than diverging . from a physical point of view",
    "this is pathological , as the area surrounding a bh should not be smaller than the one of the bh .",
    "the method in the text has the advantage of being rigorous and being applicable also to the limiting case @xmath83 .",
    "we will assume henceforth that the asymptotic region is at @xmath81 .",
    "the lower boundary @xmath48 will be left unspecified . ]",
    "again , we restrict ourselves to the @xmath52-family for sake of conciseness and comment on the general case afterwards",
    ". the curvature scalar reads @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 are some non - vanishing normalization constants and @xmath86 .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for @xmath87 what we have considered so far as `` asymptotic region '' , namely @xmath88 , is geodesically incomplete , thus becoming a singularity rather than an asymptotic region ( at the same time , for @xmath89 the `` inner region '' in the corresponding carter - penrose diagram has a geodesically complete boundary ) .",
    "thus , as might have been anticipated , these solutions are pathological , the pathology being the geodesically incomplete `` asymptotic region '' . by the same token also",
    "the half line @xmath90 may be excluded .",
    "what remains to be discussed is the limiting case @xmath83 ( we recall the logarithmic scaling according to ) . if @xmath91 then the ground state solution ( @xmath27 in ) according to has a naked singularity either at @xmath80 ( if @xmath92 ) or at @xmath81 ( if @xmath93 ) ; thus , models with @xmath83 and @xmath91 have no regular ground state solution to which the bh may evaporate , a property which should be considered as pathological . if @xmath94 the curvature scalar turns out to contain a constant term and a term scaling logarithmically with the dilaton field .",
    "this implies two curvature singularities , one at @xmath80 and another one at @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the asymptotic region is singular .",
    "the isolated models @xmath83 and @xmath95 or @xmath96 are somewhat recalcitrant . apparently , there is no singularity because the curvature scalar is just a constant proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "so we seem to have two counter examples to the claim above .",
    "however , the standard definition of singularities in general relativity invokes not some invariants of the riemann tensor but rather ( in)completeness properties of geodesics .",
    "they have been studied exhaustively for the @xmath52-family in ref .",
    "@xcite . for both cases",
    "the boundary @xmath81 turns out to be incomplete with respect to null and non - null geodesics .",
    "thus , the `` asymptotic region '' is singular , despite of curvature remaining bounded ( in fact , constant ) .",
    "again a pathology arises .",
    "one may nevertheless provide an appropriate volume definition in a different conformal frame , namely @xmath68 .",
    "this is nothing but the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite which has also constant curvature solutions .",
    "thus , the conformal transformation between these two models leaves curvature intact , which is quite remarkable ( although there is actually a difference : for the jackiw - teitelboim model the constant curvature is determined by @xmath97 in and thus the same for all solutions , while for @xmath83 , @xmath96 curvature is given by @xmath98 and thus differs from solution to solution ; so although individual solutions may be mapped onto each other , there is no mapping between the families of solutions ) .",
    "however , because of the singularity of the conformal factor ( essentially @xmath99 ) completeness properties and the causal structure may change , which is indeed what happens : the solutions of the jackiw - teitelboim model are geodesically complete at @xmath81 . on a related note , the model @xmath83 , @xmath95 is conformally related to the witten bh @xcite ;",
    "again the corresponding conformal factor exhibits two singularities .",
    "these features indicate that for each choice of @xmath100 there should be some `` preferred '' conformal frame in which the volume ought to be calculated ; it may depend on the particular application which frame this is , but quite often @xmath101 is the best choice , because only in this frame the ground state solution ( @xmath27 ) is minkowski space .",
    "[ fig:1 ] suggests to take canonically @xmath102 ( with @xmath100 given ) for the `` best behaved '' carter - penrose diagram . ]    actually , similar arguments and inspection of the curvature scalar establish that only the following class of @xmath52-models reveal none of these pathological features : @xmath103 ( minkowskian ground state models , to which spherically reduced gravity theories belong ) , @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ground state models , to which the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite belongs ) and @xmath106 ( rindler ground state models , to which the witten bh @xcite belongs ) .",
    "these special lines in the @xmath52-plane have been depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we conclude this section by remarking that the same arguments apply even if @xmath107 is an arbitrary polynomial as long as @xmath51 , because 1 .",
    "the volume definition is independent from @xmath107 and 2 .",
    "for large / small values of @xmath9 such a model will essentially belong to the @xmath52-family , so the discussion above may be employed with appropriate refinements . with a few exceptions these considerations",
    "cover practically all 2d dilaton gravity models of interest , and it may be expected that even for those exceptions ( cf .",
    "[ app : a ] for a particular example of relevance ) a similar mechanism exists which renders the volume either finite or the global structure pathological .",
    "we have seen that both of the key results of @xcite readily generalize to bhs in @xmath0 : there is an analogous definition of the volume of bhs , eq .  , and it is impossible to encounter an infinite volume in a non - singular manner while keeping the area finite . just as in @xmath108",
    "there is a mechanism that prevents the volume from diverging for bounded values of the area , which may be taken as a further indication that this is a generic property .",
    "consistency with spherically reduced gravity from any dimension has been shown and a peculiar feature of the witten bh has been pointed out ( which also holds for the exact string bh for large masses ) : its area is proportional to the volume , with some universal proportionality constant .",
    "this may have interesting implications for the interpretation of the bekenstein - hawking entropy of this string - inspired bh solution .",
    "finally , it is suggestive to propose a definition analogous to for higherdimensional scalar - tensor theories in the jordan frame / string frame .",
    "this could help to shed additional light on the issue of whether a stationary bh with finite area might have infinite volume .",

    "as a particular counter example to models with @xmath51 the exact string bh ( esbh ) @xcite will be discussed in this appendix . in the whole range of definition its volume will turn out to be finite .    for the esbh",
    "recently a unique target space action could be constructed , which allowed for the first time a calculation of its mass and entropy @xcite .",
    "it turned out to be an action of type with an additional abelian @xmath109-term , which is irrelevant for the present context .",
    "the potentials @xmath110 turned out to be rather simple functions of an auxiliary field @xmath111 , related to the relevant dilaton field @xmath9 via @xmath112 only the first term in is anticipated from a perturbative analysis .",
    "the scale parameter in in the notation of @xcite is given by @xmath113 .",
    "in the asymptotic region @xmath88 ( `` weak coupling '' ) the esbh is well approximated by the witten bh @xcite , while near the origin @xmath82 ( `` strong coupling '' ) it approaches the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite . because at the horizon the relation @xmath114 holds , the bh area reads @xmath115 insertion into the volume definition and choosing @xmath45 conveniently yields @xmath116 the mass parameter @xmath25 is bounded from below , @xmath117 . for strings in 2d",
    "one obtains @xmath118 , but like in refs .",
    "@xcite arbitrary values of @xmath25 are considered . as announced above ,",
    "remains finite in the whole range of definition .    for large masses the ratio @xmath119 approaches unity , concurrent with eq .  . for small masses , @xmath120 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath121 vanishes ; the quadratic scaling @xmath122 in the strong coupling limit is expected because the jackiw - teitelboim model also exhibits such a behaviour .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 is plotted in fig .  [ fig:2 ] .    for large bhs",
    "the volume is always slightly larger ( by @xmath123 ) than the area , while for very small bhs this trend is reversed until the ratio approaches zero .",
    "one may interpret these results as follows : for very large masses the error committed by scaling entropy with the volume ( as implied by naive quantum field theoretical considerations ) instead of scaling it with the area is almost negligible ; there are only logarithmic corrections to the entropy arising in this manner .",
    "this is a remarkable property of the esbh which it shares with the witten bh .",
    "as expected , the `` quantum field theoretical entropy '' is always larger than the bekenstein - hawking entropy , but this feature is far less pronounced than , say , for the sbh where @xmath124 and @xmath125 . while the esbh evaporates down to @xmath126 the ratio @xmath119 deviates from its asymptotic value by less than @xmath127 . only for very small masses , @xmath128 ,",
    "the `` quantum field theoretical entropy '' actually underestimates the bh entropy appreciably .",
