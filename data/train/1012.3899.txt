    "the array for microwave background anisotropy ( amiba ) is a forefront radio interferometer for research in cosmology .",
    "this project is led , designed , constructed , and operated by the academia sinica , institute of astronomy and astrophysics ( asiaa ) , taiwan , with major collaborations with national taiwan university , physics department ( ntup ) , electrical engineering department ( ntuee ) , and the australian telescope national facility ( atnf ) .",
    "contributions also came from the carnegie mellon university ( cmu ) , and the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "as a dual - channel 86 - 102 ghz interferometer array of up to 19 elements , amiba is designed to have full polarization capabilities , sampling structures on the sky greater than 2 arcmin in size .",
    "the amiba target science is the distribution of high red - shift clusters of galaxies via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) , e.g. @xcite and references therein , as a means to probe the primordial and early structure of the universe .",
    "amiba will also measure the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , e.g. @xcite , temperature anisotropies on scales , which are sensitive to structure formation scenarios of the universe .",
    "amiba is sited on mauna loa in hawaii , at an elevation of 3,400 m to take advantage of higher atmospheric transparency and minimum radio frequency interference .",
    "after an initial phase with seven 0.6  m diameter antennas @xcite in a compact configuration , the amiba is currently operating with 13 1.2  m diameter cassegrain antennas ( figure [ front ] ) .",
    "this new antenna and its capabilities are described here .",

    "previous amiba progress reports were given in @xcite .",
    "a project overview is given in @xcite .",
    "more details about the correlator and receiver can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hexapod telescope mount is introduced in @xcite . observing strategy , calibration scheme and data analysis with quality checks are described in @xcite .",
    "first amiba science results from the 7-element array are presented in @xcite .",
    "a possible science case utilizing the 1.2  m antenna array configuration is outlined in @xcite .",
    "antenna size and interferometric baselines are constrained by the required window functions sampling the scales on the sky , which are relevant for our target science . after the amiba initial phase with seven 0.6  m diameter antennas in close - packed configuration , 13 1.2  m diameter antennas are now installed , covering a baseline range from 1.4  m to about 6  m. this gives a synthesized beam resolution of about 2 arcmin for a nominal central frequency of about 94  ghz the collecting area of the 13-element array is increased by a factor of 7.4 upon the initial phase .    the antenna pointing accuracy and its mechanical stiffness requirements against wind force , self - gravity and thermal load",
    "are driven by its field of view ( fov ) , which is about @xmath2 at full width half maximum ( fwhm ) at 94  ghz ( section [ simulation ] and section [ section_beam ] ) .",
    "we consider deformations and mechanical alignment errors resulting in less than a @xmath3 tilt ( @xmath4% of fwhm ) as acceptable .",
    "minimizing deformations also ensures that the asymmetrical patterns on the antenna surface and the resulting antenna cross - polarization are kept at a low level .",
    "the manufacturing accuracy of the mirror surfaces is specified to be better than @xmath5 m root - mean - square ( rms ) to ensure an antenna surface efficiency of more than 95% ( section [ cassegrain ] and section [ surface ] ) .",
    "measuring the weak cmb fluctuations ( @xmath6k ) requires a low - noise antenna with low side lobe levels and very little scattering and cross talk .",
    "high sidelobes are suppressed with a @xmath7  db edge taper in the feed s gaussian illumination pattern ( section [ simulation ] and section [ efficiency ] ) .",
    "the antenna is shielded with a baffle to minimize the inter - antenna coupling and the ground pickup .",
    "additional care is taken to send stray - light back to the sky with triangular roof - shaped quadripod legs ( section [ baffle_leg ] ) .    due to the harsh volcanic environment together with the large high - altitude temperature variations we decided to add a tio@xmath0 protection layer on both the primary and secondary mirrors against abrasion .",
    "furthermore , visual and infrared sun light is a potential hazard to burn our antennas .",
    "the 0.6  m diameter antennas were therefore additionally covered with a gore - tex layer on top of the shielding baffle in order to absorb the damaging radiation . at our observing microwave frequencies",
    "both the protection layer and the cover are designed to minimize the absorption loss and maximize the reflectivity and the transmission , respectively ( section [ material ] ) .",
    "on the 1.2  m diameter antennas no gore - tex cover is needed because most of the visible and infrared light is not reflected by the tio@xmath0 coated surfaces .",
    "finally , minimizing any torque and possible tilting of the antennas when mounted on the receivers is crucial to reach a stable radio alignment . on top of that , in order to keep the total weight below the acceptable limits of the hexapod telescope , a lightweight structure is needed together with the desirable radio frequency properties .",
    "choosing carbon fiber reinforced plastic ( cfrp ) satisfies these conditions and keeps the weight of the antenna below 25 kg .",
    "section [ cassegrain ] describes the basic cassegrain antenna design .",
    "the results from the antenna structure and antenna - feedhorn simulations are described in sections [ simulation_structure ] and [ simulation ] .",
    "the sections [ baffle_leg ] and [ feed_leg ] discuss in more details the additional measures taken to control antenna cross - talk and to reduce ground pick - up and stray - light .      based on requirements ( section [ design ] ) ,",
    "a shielded f/0.35 cassegrain antenna was chosen .",
    "tables [ specs_primary ] and [ specs_secondary ] present the specifications for the primary paraboloid and the secondary hyperboloid mirrors .",
    "the figures [ dish120_cut ] and [ dish_picture ] show a drawing and a picture of the assembled antenna , respectively .",
    "the cassegrain geometry sets the feed phase center at the vertex of the primary .",
    "a parabolic illumination grading leads to about -20 db for the first side lobe and a 11@xmath8 fwhm for the primary beam at a wavelength of @xmath9 mm ( @xmath1 94  ghz ) .",
    "sub - reflector and feed positioning requirements are based on the ruze formulas @xcite .",
    "an axial and lateral secondary defocus of 0.1 @xmath10 and 0.45 @xmath10 , respectively , keeps the gain loss at less than 1 % .",
    "similarly , a feed horn positioning within 1 @xmath10 gives a 99 % gain .",
    "random surface deviations from a primary paraboloid and a secondary hyperboloid will remove power from the main beam and distribute it in a scattered beam . a surface error of less than 50 @xmath11 m rms from the ideal geometry ensures a 95% gain .",
    "typical load cases on the amiba site include wind , low temperatures and gravity load .",
    "based on stiffness requirements and weight considerations , carbon fiber reinforced plastic ( cfrp ) was chosen for the dish , the feedlegs and the baffle .",
    "the primary and secondary mirrors are sandwich composites .",
    "the baffle is made of two parts ( figure [ dish120_cut ] ) : a structural baffle supporting the feed - legs and a non - structural ( shielding ) baffle fixed to the latter to prevent cross - talk between antennas and minimize ground pick - up .",
    "mass is an issue as the amiba platform is designed to accommodate up to 19 identical antennas , but the hexapod drive systems sets an overall weight limit . from an original 50 kg prototype antenna , the weight was reduced to about 25 kg with the help of a finite element analysis ( fea ) , while maintaining the overall structural behavior of the antenna .",
    "the main goal of the structural analysis is to ensure that the parabolic characteristics of the primary mirror are met for a minimized mass .",
    "the simulation results presented in this section refer to the production antenna .",
    "figure [ dish_grid ] shows the grid of the fea model .",
    "the finite element model was analyzed with ansys version 11 with 15,400 nodes and 18,300 elements .",
    "in particular , 3d - shell elements were used to model the cfrp primary mirror skins , the baffle and feed - legs , and the sub - reflector coupling .",
    "3d - solid elements were adopted to model the core of the primary mirror , the structural baffle and the hexagonal support plate sandwich composites .",
    "finally , 3d - beam uniaxial elements served to model the sub - reflector and the inserts .",
    "boundary conditions apply on the hexagonal support plate and are not symmetrical with respect to the antenna geometry . therefore",
    ", structural behavior varies with the antenna orientation in its aperture plane . for each individual load case ( gravity , wind load and thermal load ) the deformation ( figure [ load_cases ] , left panels )",
    "is calculated from a displacement vector which is the sum of the nodal components .",
    "the residual map from a best fit paraboloid to the deformed primary mirror is shown in the right panels in figure [ load_cases ] .",
    "table [ summary_structure_simulation ] summarizes the results . for combined load cases the added surface deformations are within about 5  @xmath11 m over the entire elevation range .",
    "this only adds insignificantly to the manufacturing random errors ( @xmath12 m , section [ efficiency ] and figures [ primary_contour ] and [ secondary_contour ] ) and , therefore , does not further reduce the efficiency .",
    "combined resulting tilts of the optical axis are within 1  arcmin , which is at the acceptable 10% level of the fwhm ( @xmath13 arcmin ) around the operating frequency of 94  ghz .",
    "this is comparable to the achievable mechanical alignment between individual antennas on the platform which then keeps the loss in amplitude for each antenna pair at the percent level .",
    "we designed a corrugated feedhorn with a variable - depth mode converter to cover a full 20  ghz band from 85 to 105 ghz @xcite .",
    "the center frequency is around 95  ghz .",
    "the geometry of the horn is shown in figure [ amiba_horn ] .",
    "the feedhorn has a semi - flare illumination angle of 14@xmath14 with a parabolic illumination grading with a -10.5 db edge taper .",
    "free - space tapering for f/0.35 is about 3.6 db , which leads to about -20 db for the first side lobe and a 11@xmath8 fwhm for the primary beam at a wavelength of @xmath15 mm .",
    "the analysis of the horn is done using the well - proven mode - matching technique @xcite .",
    "the resulting theoretical radiation pattern is shown in figure [ amiba_horn_pattern ] .",
    "an aperture flange with an external radius of @xmath16  mm is used in the calculations .",
    "the phase - center of the horn is located 19  mm inside the horn , when measured from the aperture .",
    "the aperture of the horn is therefore located 19  mm above the vertex of the primary mirror .",
    "the radiation pattern of the antenna has been simulated @xcite , using the following two assumptions : no feed - leg blockage and no baffle is taken into account .",
    "the radiation pattern of the horn , calculated using the mode - matching method , is then used to excite currents on the secondary mirror and the physical optics ( po ) method is used to calculate the currents generated by the secondary onto the primary mirror .",
    "the radiation pattern of the antenna is then calculated using the combination of the contributions of the radiated power by the primary , secondary mirror and the feed @xcite .",
    "the gain of the antenna is normalized by the input power of the horn , i.e. , the return loss of the horn is included in the gain calculation .",
    "the efficiency calculation is based on a comparison between the gain of the antenna and the gain of an unblocked 1.2m - diameter with a constant amplitude and phase distribution .",
    "the radiation pattern at @xmath17  ghz is shown in figure [ pattern_95ghz ] while the gain of the antenna over the @xmath18  ghz band and the associated antenna efficiency are given in table [ table_simulation ] .",
    "having several antennas in a close - packed configuration on the platform can cause cross - talk problems which might affect cmb measurements @xcite .",
    "the total cross - talk signal @xmath19 for a single antenna is expected to be proportional to the number of neighboring antennas .",
    "this leads to a maximum cross - talk signal @xmath20 for the central antenna in a hexagonal compact configuration ( figure [ front ] ) , where @xmath21 is the coupling strength on the shortest baseline .",
    "the cluster sze signal is typically about 1  mk .",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuations are @xmath22  mk on cluster scales and they decrease to @xmath23k or less on smaller scales . in comparison ,",
    "the maximum false signal due to cross - talk is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the receiver noise and @xmath26 is the correlation coefficient between the outgoing and receiver noises @xcite . assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28  k for amiba @xcite , a maximum wrong signal of @xmath29  k might be present at the central antenna . adopting a 10% tolerance of the weak cmb signal , 1  @xmath11k ,",
    "@xmath21 should be reduced to about -127  db .    therefore , in order to assure a low inter - antenna cross - talk , it was decided to add a shielding baffle similar to the case of the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) . baffle height and baffle rim curvature are the important parameters to determine .",
    "our design is closely following the antennas built for the cbi @xcite .",
    "generally , the approach is to eliminate sharp discontinuities which would diffract energy from the main lobe .",
    "therefore , scattering from the baffle shield rim is minimized by rolling the rim with a radius @xmath30  mm @xcite .",
    "finally , when using a shielding baffle , its effect on the forward gain of the antenna needs to be considered . as an approximation in the antenna near - field",
    ", the fresnel diffraction integral for a circular aperture is adopted to calculate the propagating electric field , @xmath31 , above the aperture plane . the aperture field distribution , @xmath32 ,",
    "is a gaussian with a -10.5 db edge taper as a result of our feedhorn illumination . evaluating @xmath33 in the center and at the radius of the baffle location as a function of distance from the aperture plane shows a close to constant ratio between them .",
    "this finding is consistent with the expected beam broadening , @xmath34 , along the optical axis , which is less than 0.1% up to a height @xmath35  m for an initial beam waist @xmath36  m ( for a gaussian with a -10.5  db edge taper ) .",
    "consequently , the power @xmath37 remains well confined with a plane integrated loss of less than 1% ( at a height of 1  m ) compared to a broadened beam without baffle .",
    "the loss in forward gain does therefore not set any stringent constraint in this case due to the well collimated beam .",
    "eventually , it was decided to limit the baffle height to where the tangential plane at the edge of the secondary intercepts with the baffle . in the optical geometrical limit ,",
    "rays scattered from the secondary are confined to this plane .",
    "this results in a total baffle height of about @xmath38  mm above the aperture plane , which leaves the secondary and feedlegs about @xmath39  mm inside the baffle ( figure [ dish120_cut ] ) .      besides minimizing the antenna cross - talk , in order to further control the antenna sidelobe levels and scatter stray - light back towards the sky , the geometrical shape of the secondary mirror feed legs has been optimized .",
    "mainly two concerns are related to the feed leg shape : the antenna sidelobe level can increase due to diffraction from the legs and the system temperature can increase due to reflected ground pickup . @xcite and @xcite have extensively studied the issue of ground spillover pickup and feed leg shaping or baffling .",
    "one shaping technique is to attach a triangular roof on the lower side of the feed leg @xcite .",
    "an optimized angle has been worked out for our cassegrain geometry in order to keep scattered rays close to the pointing axis towards the cold sky and away from the secondary and primary mirrors . using geometrical optics ,",
    "the scattered rays are found to be within a cone with opening angle @xmath40 @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the half angle of the triangular roof and @xmath43 is the angle between the lower side of the feedleg and the optical axis of the antenna . for our design , @xmath44 , which is close to half of the primary mirror illumination angle because the feedlegs are attached close to the rim of the primary mirror ( figure [ dish120_cut ] ) . with this resulting scattering angle ( @xmath40 ) , stray - light",
    "is terminated to the cold sky .",
    "the angle @xmath40 is also well matched with the baffle height in order to avoid multiple scatterings from the baffle , which might occur if @xmath40 is too small and therefore intercepting with the upper parts of the shielding baffle .",
    "since the height of the triangular roof increases with smaller @xmath42 , @xmath45 - which would ideally send scattered rays straight to the sky ( @xmath46 ) - is practically not feasible .",
    "therefore , as a compromise @xmath47 was chosen , which confines scattered rays to within @xmath48 ( figure [ roofangle ] ) and keeps the height of the equilateral roof shape within about 20  mm .",
    "the 2-dimensional antenna beam pattern measurement in section [ section_beam ] possibly demonstrates an improvement due to this triangular roof shape .",
    "whereas for larger antennas an optimized leg design was able to reduce the system temperature of up to 10  k , in the case of our small antennas this might eventually be more a measure of precaution .",
    "the mirror surfaces are measured at the center for measurement standards ( cms ) , founded by the industrial technology research institute ( itri ) in taichung , taiwan , using a zeiss prismo 10 measuring machine with a 4.4 @xmath49 measurement accuracy .",
    "the surfaces are checked from a sample of data points : 885 and 276 uniformly distributed points are measured across the primary and secondary mirrors , respectively .",
    "this yields sets of @xmath50-coordinates for a two - dimensional fit for the primary paraboloid and the secondary hyperboloid , respectively , using the following formula : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the focal distance , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are off - sets in the @xmath55-direction due to the measurement set - up . @xmath56 and @xmath57 determine the curvature of the hyperboloid with a resulting focal distance @xmath58 ( table [ specs_primary ] and [ specs_secondary ] ) .",
    "the primary and secondary mirrors typically have surface rms errors of about 30 @xmath49 and 15 @xmath49 , respectively , as illustrated for one antenna in the figures [ primary_contour ] and [ secondary_contour ] . the resulting focal length @xmath52 is found to be within @xmath59  mm of the specifications .",
    "this reduces the dish surface efficiency by less than 2% .",
    "after verification of the surface , the antenna is assembled and the secondary mirror is mechanically shimmed to meet the alignment criteria . the alignment is typically between @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath55 translation directions .",
    "the aperture efficiency ( section [ efficiency ] ) is therefore reduced by only less than 1% .      for precision cosmology",
    "an accurately measured antenna beam pattern is essential .",
    "the beam convolution effect reduces the information of the observed signal on small angular scales which is of particular importance for the cmb power in the multipole space .",
    "furthermore , defects in the beam pattern , such as an increase in the side lobes or a circular asymmetry , can affect the sensitivity limits @xcite .",
    "besides confirming the theoretical expectations , the detailed measurement and characterization of the antenna beam pattern makes it possible to use the exact beam response in the later science data analysis if this should be needed .",
    "we measured the beam pattern with a computer - controlled equatorial mount , scanning a fixed 90 ghz thermally stabilized cw source at a distance of about @xmath64  m. this is marginally in the far field ( @xmath65  m ) .",
    "an example of a measured beam pattern from a 2-dimensional scan is shown in the left panel in figure [ antenna_beam ] . a cross - like feature",
    "likely resulting from the four legs of the secondary mirror support structure becomes apparent , with an increase in power of @xmath66  db at the location of the second sidelobe .",
    "comparing to the initial 0.6  m diameter antennas @xcite - where a cross - like structure of a few db was measured - the feature has been reduced , possibly with the help of the additional triangular roof at the secondary support structure ( section [ baffle_leg ] ) .",
    "the right panel in figure [ antenna_beam ] compares two orthogonal scans across the main beam center with the expected simulation result from section [ simulation ] for the e - plane at 95 ghz .",
    "whereas the measured mainlobe nicely confirms the simulation result , the first sidelobe is about @xmath67  db higher than expected .",
    "the detailed cause of this is unclear .",
    "one might speculate that this is due to a weaker feed illumination edge taper than predicted and remaining stray light from the secondary mirror support .",
    "the location and the level of the second sidelobe agree again well with the simulation . from the measurement , a fwhm of about 11 arcmin",
    "is found with a first sidelobe peaking at about @xmath68 to @xmath69 db .",
    "the results are further analyzed following @xcite , investigating azimuthally averaged beam profiles and @xmath70 , the indices of asymmetry : @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is the beam multipole expansion , @xmath73 being related to the corresponding angular scale . @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the mean of squares over @xmath76 and the square of the mean over @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the above defined numerator is thus the variance of @xmath77 about its mean over @xmath76 , a perfectly symmetric beam giving @xmath78 .",
    "calculating the indices of asymmetry further requires the beam data to be pixelized . as a result ,",
    "the index of asymmetry is always below 0.2 within the fwhm , indicating a good symmetry of the antennas .",
    "low cross - talk signals were verified on the operating 13-element array on the amiba site . as a measurement set - up ,",
    "one antenna served as an emitter and was outfitted with a @xmath1 10  dbm narrow - band polarized source ( gunn oscillator with a bandwidth of @xmath1 2 - 3  mhz at the measured intermediate frequency ( if ) of @xmath1 5.56  ghz 5.56  ghz corresponds roughly to an original source radio frequency ( rf ) of @xmath79  ghz , with the receiver local oscillator frequency of 84  ghz .",
    "since the source is not in a thermally stable and cooled environment , some frequency drift ( @xmath66  ghz ) in the rf is present .",
    "such small variations are , however , irrelevant for the cross - talk measurments , and the source rf always remains in our observing band . ] ) . in different adjacent antennas ( dual linear polarization receivers ) the weak cross - talk signal",
    "was then detected with a spectrum analyzer connected to the output at the end of the first section in the if chain .",
    "various amplifiers along the if chain ( from the receiving feedhorn to the end of the first section ) give rise to a gain of about 70  db @xcite . subtracting that and taking into account the source power ,",
    "the original cross - talk signal scattered into the feedhorn is derived .",
    "the coupling between two 1.2  m antennas was measured for a 1.4  m and a 2.8  m baseline . in order to quantify the influence of the shielding baffle ( figure [ dish_picture ] ) ,",
    "the measurement was done with and without baffle .",
    "figure [ cross_talk_distance ] summarizes the results .",
    "for comparison , the smaller 60  cm antennas were also checked on a few baselines . by varying the source orientation , cross - talk signals for maximally and",
    "minimally aligned polarizations were detected .",
    "for the 1.2  m antennas without baffle , there is about a 20  db difference on the shortest baseline depending on polarization .",
    "generally , this difference is reduced for longer baselines , and it becomes indistinguishable on a 1.4  m baseline for the 60  cm antennas .",
    "when adding the shielding baffle , only a minor difference in polarization of @xmath1 5  db is found on the shortest baseline for the 1.2  m antennas .",
    "the shielding baffle reduces significantly the maximum cross - talk signal from about -115  db to @xmath1 -135  db or less on the 1.4  m baseline , and from @xmath1 -130  db to @xmath1 -145  db or less on the 2.8  m baseline . as expected , for both the 60  cm and 1.2  m antennas , the cross - talk signal rapidly decreases with distance .",
    "thus , primarily the shortest baseline is of a concern . here ,",
    "the shielding baffle successfully reduces the cross - talk below the targeted -127  db level . for baselines beyond 2.8  m",
    "any remaining coupling is beyond our detection limit of about -145  db .      both the antenna structure and shielding baffle are made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic ( cfrp ) .",
    "the material has been measured with a vector network analyzer ( vna ) . for a @xmath80",
    "mm thick cfrp test sample an insertion ( through put ) loss ( s21 parameter ) of about @xmath81  db or less is measured in the frequency range of @xmath18  ghz , which is comparable to the @xmath82  mm aluminum sample which shows an insertion loss around @xmath83  db ( figure [ al_cfrp_s21 ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the values are upper limits because they are at the noise level of the vna .",
    "the return loss ( s11 parameter ) averages around @xmath84  db in the observed frequency range compared to about @xmath85  db for the aluminum sample ( figure [ al_cfrp_s21 ] , lower panel ) . from this",
    "we conclude that very little radiation goes through the baffle and the deficiency in return loss ( reflection ) is absorbed in the material , which makes cfrp and ideal and lightweight shielding material .",
    "similar vna tests have also shown that a possible gore - tex cover to protect the antenna additionally against visible and uv - light has a transmission loss of less than @xmath59  db .",
    "the surface top layers of the primary and secondary mirrors are aluminum coated in the vacuum .",
    "the reflectivity of aluminum is close to 100% as soon as there are only a few layers of atoms .",
    "further aiming at minimizing a possible emission from the underlying material , an aluminum layer attenuation to at least 1% is targeted .",
    "a 5 times skin depth leads to a reduction in amplitude by a factor of @xmath86% .",
    "this sets the coating layer to @xmath87 1.4 @xmath49 at a frequency of @xmath88 94 ghz . @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the electrical conductivity for aluminum and the free space magnetic permeability , respectively .",
    "( @xmath91m@xmath92 and @xmath93vs / am . )",
    "the typical aluminum layer - measured at various positions across the primary mirror - is about 2  @xmath11mtio@xmath0 layer was measured with an optical profilometer . from these test measurements ,",
    "an average coating of @xmath94 m was derived , with slight variations probably resulting from different angles and distances to the sputtering source . ] .",
    "additionally , a thin top layer of tio@xmath0 is applied for protection from oxidation , abrasion , peeling off and for thermal stability .",
    "aiming for a thin layer of thickness @xmath73 ( @xmath95 ) which is only very slightly lossy ( @xmath96 ) , we set @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "in here , we have adopted contain mainly two types of crystalline structures : anatase and rutile .",
    "the dielectric constant differs by about a factor of two ( @xmath99  as / vm and @xmath100  as / vm ) for parallel and perpendicular incoming waves ( at @xmath101c and @xmath102  1  mhz ) .",
    "no value for the conductivity @xmath103 at our operating frequency @xmath104 94  ghz was found in the literature . since",
    "adding o@xmath0 increases the conductivity @xmath105 , we use the available value , @xmath106 , for a conservative estimation for @xmath103 . a measured very small loss ( @xmath107 ) for @xmath108  ghz for a @xmath109 m tio@xmath0 layer @xcite is supporting this estimate . ] @xmath110 as / vm and @xmath111m@xmath92 for the tio@xmath0 dielectric constant and electrical conductivity , respectively , at our operating wavelength @xmath15 mm . the criteria for a slightly lossy layer",
    "is easily met with @xmath112 .",
    "this criteria also ensures that no microwave depolarization arises from the thin top layer @xcite .",
    "the tio@xmath0 vacuum sputtering is done immediately after the al sputtering .",
    "one sputtering run typically gives a layer of about @xmath113 m .",
    "we remark that this additional thin tio@xmath0 layer would even allow direct sun observations . in tests where the antenna was directly pointed at the sun , a maximum temperature of 46@xmath114c",
    "was measured after 20 minutes at the surface of the secondary mirror .",
    "the reflection of visible and infrared light is likely to be significantly reduced due to multi - reflections in the tio@xmath0 layer .",
    "consequently , only a small portion of heat is reflected to the secondary mirror and further to the feedhorn .",
    "this small heat flux has also proven to be of no damage for the secondary mirror support structure made from cfrp . for comparison ,",
    "the initially used smaller 0.6  m diameter antennas ( without tio@xmath0 coating ) showed a temperature increase to 70@xmath114c within only two minutes .",
    "in order to derive an overall system efficiency for amiba @xcite , we analyze here the antenna aperture efficiency @xmath115 .",
    "generally , @xmath115 can be written as the product of a number of independent efficiency components , e.g. @xcite : @xmath116 where : + @xmath117= illumination efficiency of the aperture by the feedhorn taper function + @xmath118= blocking efficiency due to the secondary mirror and its quadripod leg support + @xmath119= surface error efficiency due to small manufacturing random errors + @xmath120= spillover efficiency of the feed and the secondary mirror + @xmath121= focus error efficiency + @xmath122= cross - polarization efficiency of the feed - antenna combination + @xmath123= incoming radiation loss due to absorption from the gore - tex cover + @xmath124= diffraction loss and reflector surface ohmic loss + part of the following analysis is based on the guidelines in @xcite .",
    "the illumination efficiency @xmath117 of the antenna is the ratio of the gain of the antenna to that of a uniformly illuminated aperture .",
    "an edge taper is applied to reduce the sidelobe levels .",
    "our 1.2 m antenna has a gaussian illumination pattern with a @xmath7  db edge taper . for a gaussian distribution , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the aperture radius and @xmath127 with @xmath128 the edge taper in db ,",
    "the illumination efficiency @xmath129 becomes : @xmath130 for our antenna we derive @xmath131% .",
    "the loss of gain due to the blockage , @xmath118 , is given by : @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the total blocked area and the aperture area , respectively .",
    "the double loss results from a decrease in the reflector area for the incoming plane wave front , and a reduction of the incoming energy ( spherical wave ) to the focus .",
    "@xmath133 is composed by the central obstruction due to the sub - reflector ( @xmath135 ) , the plane wave shadow ( @xmath136 ) and the spherical wave shadow area . the spherical wave shadow ( from the quadripod legs ) is zero , since the legs are attached to the baffle and not the primary reflector ( figure [ dish_picture ] ) .",
    "following @xcite for the case of a tapered illumination with a @xmath7  db edge taper , we have : @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the radius of the primary and secondary mirror , and the width of the leg , respectively .",
    "the aperture surface @xmath134 is reduced by the apex hole . for our antenna geometry ( tables [ specs_primary ] and [ specs_secondary ] ) we derive @xmath141% .",
    "the surface error efficiency @xmath119 caused by small manufacturing random errors is calculated following @xcite : @xmath142 where @xmath10 and @xmath143 are the observing wavelength and the rms surface deviation parallel to the antenna axis , respectively .",
    "the manufacturing errors in @xmath55-direction with respect to the ideal geometrical surfaces are illustrated in the figures [ primary_contour ] and [ secondary_contour ] .",
    "they typically lead to @xmath144% , ( @xmath145% and @xmath146% for the primary and secondary mirrors , respectively ) , which is significantly better than the commonly accepted error @xmath147 which limits the gain loss to 10% .    the feed spillover efficiency @xmath120 measures the power radiated by the feed which is intercepted by the sub - reflector with the subtended angle @xmath148 ( table [ specs_secondary ] ) : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the power pattern of the feed .",
    "from the secondary mirror illumination angle , @xmath151 deg , and the feed illumination pattern , figure [ amiba_horn_pattern ] at @xmath152  ghz , we derive @xmath153 .",
    "the focus error efficiency @xmath121 is conveniently analyzed separately for secondary mirror and feed , and for axial and lateral defocusing .",
    "following @xcite , the gain loss for the sub - reflector axial defocusing @xmath154 can be expressed in units of wavelength @xmath10 for different feed illumination patterns . for @xmath155 ( in our case @xmath156 for @xmath157  mm )",
    "the aperture efficiency is better than @xmath158% independent of the illumination pattern .",
    "the axial defocus does not cause any change in the beam direction , and therefore there is no associated antenna pointing error .",
    "the placement of the feed in the secondary focus is less critical @xcite with @xmath159 still giving a @xmath158% efficiency .",
    "we do not expect any efficiency loss here .",
    "similarly , the lateral defocus tolerances were analyzed in @xcite : a positioning error of less than @xmath160 assures a loss less than @xmath161% .",
    "the measured alignment ( section [ surface ] ) is well within this limit .",
    "the resulting pointing error is less than @xmath162 .",
    "the sidelobe levels are unchanged with no coma - lobes .",
    "the instrumental polarization or polarization cross - talk is the ratio of the undesired orthogonal component to the desired one .",
    "the effect can be minimized with precision parts : no asymmetries in mirrors and feedhorn , no squint feed and no antenna distortion .",
    "since the antenna reverses the polarization and since the primary and secondary surfaces have a parabolic and a hyperbolic curvature with a finite size , a parasitic cross - polarization component with the opposite polarization is introduced .",
    "the effect is curvature dependent and grows for a deeper dish .",
    "we define the cross - polarization efficiency @xmath122 as : @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the co- and cross - polar patterns , calculated in figure [ pattern_95ghz ] .",
    "assuming a negligible contribution from asymmetries in the surfaces and the feed , the level of cross - polarization @xmath165 is more than @xmath166 dbi lower than the co - polarization within the main beam . the resulting efficiency loss ( @xmath167% )",
    "can therefore be neglected .",
    "the finite sub - reflector size ( based on a geometric optics design ) produces diffraction causing further phase errors , amplitude taper losses and cross - polarization changes .",
    "all these losses are summarized in a diffraction loss term .",
    "they have been analyzed numerically and the loss terms are given in a tabulated form in @xcite .",
    "for our antenna parameters the diffraction loss is about @xmath168  db . the efficiency term due to ohmic losses is usually negligible .",
    "thus , @xmath169 .    finally , the absorption from a possible antenna gore - tex cover is about 0.1  db ( section [ material ] ) , and hence , the antenna cover efficiency @xmath170 .",
    "all the efficiency components with the resulting aperture efficiency @xmath115 are summarized in table [ efficiency_table ] .",
    "from the initial 7-element array operation with 0.6  m antennas to the currently operating 13-element array with 1.2  m antennas several improvements were made .",
    "table [ comparison_antenna ] summarizes them with their resulting benefits .",
    "structure - wise , a major reduction in weight per unit surface ",
    "10  kg for the 0.6  m antenna , @xmath17125  kg for the 4 times larger collecting area of the 1.2  m antenna  without compromising on the antenna stiffness was achieved with detailed fea modeling .",
    "this has been an important design requirement in order to keep the resulting torques on receiver and bracket within acceptable limits . in this way ,",
    "a stable radio alignment of @xmath172 between antennas is achievable .",
    "maintaining a mirror surface accuracy for the larger 1.2  m antennas to better than @xmath173 m leaves the possibility open to operate the array up to 300 or 400  ghz with possible future modifications .",
    "a significant improvement in the 1.2  m optical design was made possible with a higher shielding baffle without reducing the forward gain of the antenna . as a consequence ,",
    "the inter - antenna coupling was reduced by more than one order of magnitude as compared to the 0.6  m antennas to @xmath174  db .",
    "given sufficient integration time , this will allow for deep cmb observations below the initial target level of 10  @xmath11k .",
    "finally , a tio@xmath0 top layer is added on both primary and secondary mirrors as a protective measure .",
    "this makes the costly gore - tex cover redundant . at the same time , sun observations for testing purposes are possible without damaging the mirrors .    as a fundamental difference compared to earlier",
    "machined cast aluminum antennas ( cbi , @xcite ) the amiba antennas are almost entirely made out of cfrp .",
    "the linear thermal expansion coefficient @xmath42 is about an order of magnitude smaller than in the case of al ( @xmath175  k@xmath92 , @xmath176  k@xmath92 ) .",
    "this reduces the thermal load ( @xmath177  k on the amiba site ) and further ensures a very stable pointing of the antennas .",
    "the cfrp s superior tensile strength ( @xmath178  mpa compared to about 500  mpa for aluminum ) combined with its lower density ( @xmath179  g/@xmath180 , @xmath181  g/@xmath180 ) make for a lightweight antenna ( @xmath1 25  kg ) .",
    "this is crucial in order to keep the overall weight on the platform within the limits of the hexapod . for comparison , an equally stiff antenna made out of aluminum",
    "is estimated to be at least 35  kg .      a most immediate upgrade results from the significantly increased collecting area with the 1.2  m antennas .",
    "the original seven 0.6  m antennas were deployed in a close - packed hexagonal pattern on the amiba platform in order to utilize the shortest spacings ( 0.6  m ) of the interferometer .",
    "this maximized the sensitivity for extended structures in clusters and primary cmb with a synthesized beam resolution of about 6 arcmin and a primary antenna beam of about 22 arcmin fwhm .",
    "the point source sensitivity in 1 hour on - source integration was about 63  mjy . by replacing the 0.6  m antennas with 1.2  m diameter antennas , the collecting area and the speed in pointed observations",
    "are increased by a factor of 4 and 16 , respectively .",
    "the additional upgrade from 7 to 13 antennas leads to an overall speed - up factor of about 55 . with the longest baselines a higher synthesized beam resolution of up to",
    "2 arcmin can be achieved .",
    "the resulting point source sensitivity is around 8  mjy / beam in 1 hour .",
    "the primary antenna beam is reduced to about 11 arcmin fwhm .",
    "additionally , the larger number of antennas ( 78 baselines compared to 21 in the initial 7-element array ) leads to a better @xmath182-coverage with a higher dynamical range and , therefore , better imaging capabilities . whereas the initial array was only able to detect the cluster large - scale structures",
    ", the current 13-element upgraded array resolves weaker cluster substructures at the arcmin scale .",
    "this will allow us to study more detailed cluster physics in combination with x - ray and optical data . in continuous observation",
    "about 50 clusters can be detected per year . in this way",
    "a substantial sample can be built up for statistical studies .",
    "the cmb power spectrum can be probed up to a scale @xmath183 , compared to the initial windows around @xmath184 and 2500 .",
    "the current science operations are focused on cluster observations .",
    "a 1.2  m @xmath185 cassegrain antenna for a single platform close - packed interferometer for astronomical radio observations is presented .",
    "due to weight constraints , carbon fiber reinforced plastic ( cfrp ) is chosen as a lightweight material for the main antenna parts . with a detailed finite element analysis ( fea )",
    "it has been possible to keep the weight within 25  kg .",
    "the primary and secondary mirror sandwich composite structures show excellent behavior under thermal , wind and gravity load , leading to fea predicted surface rms deformation errors of less than 10  @xmath11 m and maximum tilts in the optical axis of about 1 arcmin .",
    "the primary paraboloid and secondary hyperboloid mirror manufactured surface rms errors are typically around 30  @xmath11 m and 10  @xmath11 m , respectively . the mechanical alignment after shimming and",
    "the resulting focal length are within @xmath22  mm of the specifications .",
    "the efficiency loss due to mechanical assembly and manufacturing is then within @xmath1 1% . for a good reflectivity",
    "the mirrors are coated with a @xmath186 m aluminum layer .",
    "additionally , on top of that , a thin tio@xmath0 layer ( @xmath187 m ) protects the antenna from the harsh high altitude volcanic environment .    a corrugated feedhorn with a parabolic illumination grading with a @xmath7  db edge taper is used to achieve low sidelobe levels .",
    "the feedhorn antenna system is simulated and designed with the mode - matching technique .",
    "the results are verified in a far - field beam pattern measurement . for the observing frequency around 94  ghz ,",
    "the first sidelobe is around -20  db with a main lobe fwhm of about 11 arcmin . with the goal of sending more stray - light to the sky , legs with a triangular roof shape",
    "are added to the secondary mirror support structure . despite this attempt , a weak remaining feature in the beam map at the level of @xmath66  db around",
    "the secondary sidelobe is likely to be attributed to the secondary mirror support structure .",
    "measuring the weak cmb signals ( @xmath1 10 @xmath11k ) poses a challenge for a close - packed array due to inter - antenna coupling .",
    "a cfrp shielding baffle is therefore added , which extends to a height of @xmath188  mm above the secondary mirror .",
    "insertion and return loss measurements show that cfrp is indeed an ideal lightweight shielding material . without loss in the antenna forward",
    "gain , the antenna cross - talk on the shortest separation of 1.4  m is measured to be @xmath189  db or less .",
    "an overall antenna efficiency of about 60% is estimated from a series of efficiency factors . the dominating loss results from the feed spill - over ( efficiency @xmath190 ) , followed by the illumination efficiency ( @xmath191 ) and the secondary mirror blockage efficiency ( @xmath192 ) .    in summary , based on the calculated and measured properties ,",
    "the presented cfrp antenna is a lightweight , low side - lobe level and low noise antenna .",
    "thus , it is appropriate for the targeted astronomical observations ( cosmic microwave background and galaxy cluster observations ) in close - packed antenna array configurations .",
    "currently , a 13-element compact array is used in daily routine observations .",
