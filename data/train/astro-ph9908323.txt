    "the first measurement of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) dates back to the early 60s ( giacconi et al . 1962 ) .",
    "this serendipitous discovery posed the still unsolved problem of the origin of the cxb .",
    "later observations ( e.g. schwartz & gursky 1974 ) have shown that the cxb above 1 kev is highly isotropic .",
    "this , as well as other evidence , has led to the current understanding that the cxb , at energies above 1 kev , is of extragalactic origin .",
    "high angular resolution x - ray observations , and the absence of distorsions in the cosmic microwave background spectrum ( fixsen et al . 1996 ) , support the idea that the cxb above 1 kev is dominated by the integrated emission from faint sources , with a dominant contribution coming from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "recent results from x - ray surveys show that the fraction of the cxb due to discrete sourcers is 70 - 80% in the 0.52.0 kev band ( @xcite ) and at least 30% in the 210 kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cxb spectrum in the 350 kev band , measured by heao1 a2 ( @xcite ) , is adequately represented by a power - law with an exponential cutoff at @xmath6 40 kev . in the 210 kev energy range",
    "the cxb spectrum is approximated by a power - law with photon index 1.4 .",
    "further measurements of the cxb spectrum , performed with the rosat pspc ( @xcite ) in the 0.52.0 kev band , with the asca sis ( @xcite ) in the 0.47.0 kev band , and with the asca gis ( @xcite ) in the 1.010.0 kev band , disagree at about the 20%-30% level as to the value of the 1 kev normalization . while the asca gis and rosat pspc measurements give values around 11  photon  s@xmath5  @xmath4  kev@xmath5  sr@xmath5 , the asca sis spectrum , which lies on the extrapolation of the heao1 a2 measurement , yields a value of @xmath6 9  photon  s@xmath5  @xmath4  kev@xmath5  sr@xmath5 .",
    "new observations of the cxb spectrum are needed to clarify the issue .",
    "in this letter we present a new measurement of the cxb spectrum , in the 1.0 - 8.0 kev , obtained with the lecs and mecs instruments on board . a previous measurement , using lecs data alone , has been presented by parmar et al .",
    "( 1999 ; p99 hereinafter ) .",
    "the remainder of the letter is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we discuss instrumental issues relevant to the analysis of the lecs and mecs cxb spectra . in sect .",
    "3 we present the list of observations which have been used to measure the cxb spectrum . in sect .",
    "4 we report on the spectral analysis . in sect .",
    "5 we discuss our findings and compare them to previous results .",
    "the low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ; 0.110  kev ; parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) is an imaging scintillation proportional counter on - board the italian - dutch  x - ray astronomy mission ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has a circular field of view of 18.5   radius , an effective area of @xmath740  @xmath8 at 2  kev and an energy resolution of @xmath78% at 6  kev .",
    "details on the cxb data reduction can be found in p99 .",
    "briefly , the cxb was accumulated within a central circle with an 8   radius .",
    "the spectrum of the non x - ray background ( nxb ) has been accumulated during 816.3  ks of dark earth pointing ( this is a factor 1.6 greater than in p99 ) .",
    "the response matrix we employ is the same used by p99 .",
    "briefly , we recall that the response matrix , which is appropriate for the diffuse emission , has been generated , by simulating a set of 100 point sources , randomly distributed within a radius of 12 , therefore larger than the cxb accumulation region .",
    "this matrix includes also the effect of off - axis mirror vignetting and the average obscuration of the support strongback .",
    "moreover the lecs matrix has been corrected for the @xmath615% lecs / mecs crosscalibration missmatch present in the september 1997 release of   matrices .",
    "we expect any residual crosscalibration error between lecs and mecs to be less than @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to the above effects , single reflected x - rays from within 120  can be detected in the fov ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitude of this effect has been found to be @xmath101% of the flux within an 8  extraction radius ( p99 ) . since this is well within the uncertainty in cxb normalization , this effect is ignored .      the medium - energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ; 1.510  kev ; @xcite ) is an imaging gas scintillation proportional counter .",
    "the mecs was originally composed of 3 units , mecs1 , mecs2 and mecs3 .",
    "mecs1 failed in may 1997 , in this paper we shall use only data from the 2 units which are still operative .",
    "the energy resolution is 8% at 6 kev .",
    "the combined on - axis effective area for the mecs2 and mecs3 units is @xmath680  @xmath11 at 2.0 kev and @xmath660  @xmath11 at 8  kev .",
    "the mecs has a circular field of view ( fov ) of 25@xmath12 radius .",
    "an annular support structure , commonly referred to as strongback , is localized at about 10@xmath12 from the center of the detector .",
    "the absolute flux calibration of the mecs was performed using the crab nebula spectrum .",
    "assuming a power - law model the photon index , @xmath13 , and the 2 - 10 kev flux , f(2 - 10 ) , for the crab , are found to be @xmath14 and f(2 - 10)@xmath15 erg @xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "repeated observations have not revealed any significant variations in either of these parameters so far ( sacco 1999 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the line of sight n@xmath16 for the crab , may affect at the few percent level the mecs calibration in the softest ( 1.65 - 2.0 kev ) energy band .",
    "for the present work we have chosen to accumulate spectra from a relatively small central circular region with radius 8@xmath12 .",
    "the main reasons for this choice are that : _",
    "i ) _ the ratio of the cxb to the nxb is at its highest at the center of the detector ; _ ii ) _ we avoid complications associated to the obscuration form the strongback ; _ iii ) _ the inner region of the mecs detector is better calibrated than the outer one .",
    "we have created a response matrix appropriate for uniform diffuse emission .",
    "this matrix differs from the standard point - source response matrix in the following ways : _ i)_the effects of off - axis mirror vignetting are included ; _",
    "ii)_the cxb is modeled as a uniform diffuse emission , within a radius of 12 .",
    "the mecs response matrix has been generated using the effarea program publically available within the latest saxdas release .",
    "the nxb accounts for a significant fraction of the total background , thus a correct measurement of the nxb is needed to measure the cxb .",
    "a total of 1850  ks of nxb data was accumulated using mecs dark earth pointings . in the central 8",
    "the mecs nxb spectrum is approximately constant with energy , with a count rate of @xmath17  cts  s@xmath5  kev  @xmath5 mecs@xmath5 , between 1.0 and 4.5 kev . between 4.5 kev and 7 kev",
    "there is a smooth increase in count rate with 3 discrete line - like features superposed . above 7 kev",
    "the spectrum is again flat with a count rate of @xmath18  cts  s@xmath5  kev  @xmath5 mecs@xmath5 . above @xmath68",
    "kev , the nxb dominates the overall background spectrum . due to the low - inclination , almost circular ,  orbit ,",
    "variations in the nxb counting rate around the orbit are negligible .",

    "( 1999 ) we have estimated that about 5% of the total cxb is produced by source above the @xmath28  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 flux limit .",

    "since a fraction of the 1 - 2 kev cxb may quite possibly not be of extragalactic origin , we have fitted the cxb spectra with a power - law together with a single temperature optically thin plasma ( the mewe - kaastra - liehdal plasma emissivity model in xspec , @xcite ) . since we are not interested in the thermal component in itself , we fixed its parameters to the best fitting values derived by p99 when fitting the lecs spectrum of the cxb . the power - law plus thermal component fit , which is reported in fig . 1 , gives an acceptable @xmath34 of 75.0 for 74 degrees of freedom ( dof ) with @xmath37 , a normalization of @xmath38  photon  s@xmath5  @xmath4  kev@xmath5  sr@xmath5 at 1  kev and a normalization of @xmath36  photon  s@xmath5  @xmath4  kev@xmath5  sr@xmath5 at 4 kev .",

    "note that we have associated a 5% error to the normalization of our measurement to account for residual uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the lecs and mecs instruments .",
