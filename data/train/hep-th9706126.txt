    "after an extensive investigation baker , ball and zachariasen @xcite ( bbz ) have developed a number of arguments to support the use of the dual color fields ( derived from the color electric vector potential @xmath0 ) , instead of the usual yang - mills fields ( derived from the magnetic vector potential @xmath1 ) , to formulate an effective theory of long - distance quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . the dyson - schwinger equation may be used to justify some of their arguments , since it shows that corrections to the leading terms in the @xmath1 propagator @xmath2 are more singular in the infrared region that the leading term .",
    "this behavior is not true for the @xmath0 propagator , and thus one should use the dual fields in the long - distance region .",
    "furthermore , bbz argue that the connections between the dual fields and the yang - mills fields are nonlocal and require the introduction of an additional field .",
    "they use this requirement to good advantage by introducing higgs fields , which allow a symmetry breaking mechanism to operate and thus confinement is explained as a meissner effect , in the spirit of the t hooft - mandelstam conjecture @xcite , where a magnetic condensate exerts pressure on the gluon field lines .",
    "the bbz lagrangian leads to an effective field theory with many of the properties expected from qcd , such as unitarity , renormalizability and non - abelian gauge invariance .",
    "one can also show that the theory undergoes a deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "a recent examination of the foundations of the bbz model @xcite led to a reformulation of the theoretical underpinnings in a wilson loop context .    in their more recent work bbz @xcite",
    "have constructed an interaction potential between a quark source and its antiquark by developing an expansion in inverse powers of the constituent masses .",
    "they use the field equations to eliminate the gluon and the higgs fields and express the interaction energy in terms of the quark and antiquark variables .",
    "they can readily identify the central potential , the spin - dependent potentials and the leading relativistic corrections to the central potential . in this paper",
    "we explore some of the problems that arise when one attempts to use this potential in systems where relativistic corrections are more important .",
    "in particular , we attempt to give a simultaneous account of the properties of charmonium , the upsilon system and the heavy light systems using the spinless salpeter equation @xcite for relativistic kinematics and a single set of potential parameters @xcite . in addressing this issue",
    "we will be led to examine questions about the relationships between the constants in the bbz potential components and the parameters associated with mass renormalization @xcite .",
    "we note in passing the interesting work of crater and alstine @xcite that explores the question of a universal quark - antiquark potential in the context of the todorov equation and constraint dynamics .",
    "since spin dependence is not a natural companion to work based on the spinless salpeter equation , we will focus on spin - averaged energies as the point of contact with experiment .",
    "this goal is consistent with the goal of the bbz investigations to produce an effective theory of long - range qcd , since spin - dependent splittings are presumably more sensitive to the short - range behavior of the potentials , where running coupling constant effects are important .",
    "although it is possible to accomodate such effects within the framework of the bbz model , this involves additional assumptions @xcite .",
    "we have plans to pursue the role of the spin dependence in the context of the work of hardekopf and sucher @xcite .",
    "our method of solution of the spinless salpeter equation is based on a recent improvement @xcite of the rayleigh - ritz - galerkin method .",
    "the purpose of our calculation is to see how successful one can be with the leading relativistic corrections and what role experiments might play in constraining these corrections and their relativistic generalizations .",
    "we establish contact with recent precision lattice gauge calculations of bali , schilling and wachter @xcite in order to have an additional guide for evaluating the relativistic corrections .",

    "the fundamental degrees of freedom of the bbz model are an octet of dual gluon potentials @xmath3 and a triple of scalar higgs fields @xmath4 . because of the symmetry breaking mechanism",
    ", these higgs fields have nonzero vacuum expectation values , which give rise to effective masses for the dual gluons and two of the scalar higgs fields .",
    "these effective masses are responsible for the exponential damping of all fields outside of the region of the sources and the flux tube that connects them .",

    ", one must introduce these particles as classical sources with masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 and spins @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are located at @xmath22 and @xmath23 and connected by a dirac string .",

    "the relationships between the fields and the potentials also include explicit contributions from the color magnetization * m * and the color polarization * m * , which arise from the spin dependence of the sources .",
    "thus ,    [ str ] @xmath30 @xmath31    from the lagrangian density of eq .",

    "( [ str ] ) , and thus the energy content of the fields surrounding the sources is completely determined by the solution to these field equations .",
    "substituting these solutions into the expression for the lagrangian density and integrating over all space gives the energy of the quark - antiquark system as a function of the source parameters @xmath32 , @xmath28 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus the potential is given by @xmath34    it is straightforward to identify the central potential , the spin - dependent potential and the velocity - dependent corrections to the central potential , that is , @xmath35 where the central potential is given by @xmath36 it is not necessary to list the spin - dependent potential here , since it will not contribute to the spin - averaged energies in the lowest order .",
    "the velocity - dependent corrections to the central potential are given by the sum of an angular - momentum term and a radial - momentum term , namely , @xmath37 .",
    "each of these terms consists of two parts ,    [ angrad ] @xmath38^{\\rm 2 } / 4 \\rm r^{2 } \\ ; + \\ ; v_{-}\\:\\left[\\bf r \\times \\left ( v_{\\rm 1 } + v_{\\rm 2 } \\right)\\right]^{\\rm 2 } / 4 \\rm r^{2},\\ ] ] @xmath39^{\\rm 2 } / 4 \\rm r^{2 } \\ ; + \\ ; v_{l } \\:\\left[\\bf r \\cdot \\left(v_{\\rm 1 }   - v_{\\rm 2 } \\right ) \\right]^{\\rm 2 } / 4 \\rm r^{2}.\\ ] ]    the potentials listed in eqs .",

    "@xmath41 @xmath42    thus only two parameters , the string constant @xmath43 and the strong coupling constant @xmath44 are required to determine the potential . of course , in the center - of - momentum frame the constituent masses become part of the parametrization through the relations , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . since agreement with experiment will not be easy to achieve , it is important to explore the sensitivity of the calculation to various parts of @xmath47 .",

    "two important advantages accompany the use of these basis functions .",
    "the first of these is that all of the basic matrix elements that we require to find the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of eq .",
    "( [ salop ] ) can be generated from straightforward analytic expressions .",
    "the second is that the confinement factors of eq .",
    "( [ basisfn ] ) are a sufficienly good approximation to the actual wave function that the sizes of the requisite matrices are relatively modest ( @xmath66 or @xmath67 ) .",

    "there results are listed for five different matrix sizes used to find the eigenvalues of @xmath74 , as discussed in step 2 of the algorithm below eq.([separ ] ) . since there is no discernible difference in the matrix elements listed in the middle four columns and these results",
    "agree with the analytic results , one concludes that using a @xmath67 matrix should generate very accurate results for @xmath86 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues listed in table [ potmat ] were obtained with kinetic energy matrices the same size as the potential energy matrices .",
    "for the three smaller cases the hamiltonian matrices were also chosen the same size as the kinetic and potential energy matrices , but for the two larger cases a @xmath66 matrix was used for the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "all of these results are consistent with our earlier study @xcite of the stability of the algorithm used to take the square roots of the kinetic energy operator and the choice of @xmath87 as adequate for the hamiltonian matrix .    in summary",
    "our calculation of the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions requires four separate matrix diagonalizations , two to determine the kinetic energy operators , one to determine the residual operator @xmath78 , which represents the difference between the yukawa potential and the coulomb potential , and a fourth to diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix . for the first three diagonalizations we use @xmath67 matrices , and for the last we use a @xmath66 matrix .",
    "one can generate accurate results for a range of scale values .",

    "( [ com ] ) must respect the principle of hermiticity .",
    "although this principle is an adequate guide to determine the appropriate combination of any two noncommuting operators , some additional considerations are required for more complicated combinations . to resolve the ambiguity , we choose to interprete the combinations of momentum and position operators in eq .",
    "( [ com ] ) with the gromes @xcite double - bracket notation , @xmath94.\\ ] ] this expression has the virtue that it is manifestly hermitian and that it is involved in the nonrelativistic reductions of several covariant dirac potentials .",
    "one additional difficulty requires some comment .",
    "the s - state expectation value of @xmath47 , the first - order perturbation theory improvement , leads to singular integrals .",
    "such terms arise because of the dominant influence of the coulomb part of @xmath95 upon the salpeter wave function at short distances .",
    "nickisch , durand and durand @xcite have shown that the small r behavior of the 1s radial function is given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 for realistic values of @xmath98 . to illustrate this behavior we choose one of the factors that arises from the last term of @xmath99 , that is @xmath100 the small @xmath101 behavior of the integrand",
    "is given by @xmath102 , which leads to a divergent integral at the lower limit .",

    "thus , the constituent masses should provide a high - momentum cutoff in a more accurate treatment .",
    "translating this observation into position space suggests that the compton wavelengths of the constituent quarks should provide a short - distance cutoff , which would prevent the singular behavior . since the singular behavior arises in the perturbative limit of eq .",
    "( [ dar ] ) and this equation is symmetric in the two masses , we choose a cutoff that is the geometric mean of the constituent compton wavelengths , that is , @xmath105 .",
    "this choice does not introduce any new paramters into the calculation .",
    "since all of the singular integrals that arise in the calculation of the expectation value of @xmath47 have exactly the same behavior , one cutoff suffices to eliminate this behavior .",

    "( [ secondform ] ) .",
    "the relativistic correction of the dotted curve has the wrong sign to move the salpeter results towards agreement with experiment .",
    "the appearance of a pronounced minimum near 0.325 gev shows the return of nonphysical behavior similar to the schrdinger results , that is , the mass of the system increases as the constituent mass decreases .",
    "such behavior has also been noted by bbz in an appendix of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the results of the dashed curve exhibit the characteristics necessary for agreement with experiment .",

    "the remaining two curves in fig .  [ fig1 ] are based on additional modifications of @xmath54 or @xmath47 , which might be helpful in isolating the reasons behind the striking differences between the dotted and dashed curves there .",
    "the dot - short dashed curve of fig .  [ fig1 ] is based on eq .",
    "( [ thirdform ] ) .",
    "all of the difference between this curve and the dashed curve is due to the exponential damping of the yukawa factor .",

    "( [ integ ] ) .",
    "the long and short dashed curve is the result of an attempt to see if the freedom implicit in mass renormalization can be helpful in removing the discrepancy between the bbz model ( dotted curve ) and experiment .",
    "barchielli , brambilla and prosperi @xcite show that a redefinition of the constituent masses leads to changes in the components of the velocity - dependent potential @xmath47at least in the nonrelativistic limit , since , if one makes the replacement @xmath109 , the hamiltonian          the two @xmath112-dependent terms can be absorbed in a redefinition of the potentials @xmath95 and @xmath47 .",
    "however , one must be careful to respect the momentum dependence prescribed by the form of eq .",

    "the differences between the long and short dashed curve and the dotted curve , which become larger at smaller values of the light quark mass , probably reflect the fact that one requires a different mass renormalization procedure in this region .",
    "it is worth noting that the parameters used to obtain each of the curves in fig .",

    "<S> baker , ball and zachariasen have developed an elegant formulation of the dual superconducting model of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which allows one to use the field equations to eliminate the gluon and higgs degrees of freedom and thus to express the interaction between quarks as an effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> carrying out an expansion in inverse powers of the constituent quark masses , these authors succeeded in identifying the central part , the spin - dependent part and the leading relativistic corrections to the central potential . </S>",
    "<S> the potential offers a good account of the energies and splittings of charmonium and the upsilon system . since all of the flavor dependence of the interaction is presumed to enter through the constituent masses , it is possible to test the potential in other systems . </S>",
    "<S> logical candidates are the heavy b - flavor charmed system and the heavy - light systems , which should be more sensitive to the relativistic corrections . </S>",
    "<S> lattice gauge calculations furnish an additional point of contact for the components of the bbz potential . </S>",
    "<S> some preliminary calculations of the energies of b and d mesons are presented and the challenge of agreement with experiment is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the spinless salpeter equation is used to account for the effects of relativistic kinematics . </S>"
