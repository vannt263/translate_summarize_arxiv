    "when supercooled liquids are rapidly quenched at rates @xmath3 exceeding a critical value @xmath0 , crystallization is avoided , and systems form disordered solids such as bulk metallic glasses ( bmgs ) .",
    "bmgs possess high mechanical strength and can be processed so that they display plastic  @xcite , not brittle , response to applied deformations , which makes them desirable materials for a variety of industrial and engineering applications  @xcite .",
    "avoiding crystallization in pure metals requires enormously large cooling rates in excess of @xmath4 k / s .",
    "however , bulk metallic glass - forming alloys have been developed for which the critical cooling rate is more than nine orders of magnitude lower , in the range @xmath5 k / s .",
    "understanding the important physical quantities that determine the glass - forming ability of multi - component alloys will allow us to develop even stronger and less costly bulk metallic glasses .",
    "prior research suggests that multi - component metallic alloys with @xmath6 form bmgs , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the glass transition and melting temperature , respectively  @xcite .",
    "in addition , inoue  @xcite has emphasized three guidelines for enabling bmg formation , rather than crystallization : 1 ) atomic size ratios ( small relative to large ) of @xmath9 for at least two constituents of the alloy ; 2 ) large negative heats of mixing  @xcite ; and 3 ) several atomic components . in fig .",

    "the most probable atomic size ratio is @xmath10 and heat of mixing is negative and roughly @xmath11-@xmath12 of the average cohesive energy .",
    "however , beyond these heuristic guidelines , there is no quantitative and predictive understanding of the glass - forming ability in multi - component alloys .",
    "( note that there have been previous measurements of the critical cooling rate in binary hard - sphere systems  @xcite . ) for model bmg - forming systems with attractive interactions , we do not know the dependence of the critical cooling rate on the stoichiometry , size ratios , and heats of mixing of the constituent atomic species .",
    "for example , can multi - component systems with large negative heats of mixing , but smaller atomic size mismatches possess the same glass - forming ability as systems with small negative heats of mixing but larger atomic size mismatches ?",
    "we perform molecular dynamics simulations of model glass - forming systems , binary lennard - jones mixtures of spherical particles , to measure the critical cooling rate as a function of the size ratio , number fraction , and interaction energy of the two particle species .",
    "we find several important results .",

    ", the minimum critical cooling rate occurs at the number fraction corresponding to equal volumes of the large and small particles .",
    "in addition , we find that at fixed number fraction and size ratio , the critical cooling rate decreases strongly with decreasing cohesive energy ratio of the small particles relative to the large ones , @xmath16 .",

    "we define the critical cooling rate , @xmath0 , as the rate at which the median local bond orientational order parameter crosses the threshold value @xmath68 .",
    "we chose the threshold @xmath69 for several reasons : 1 ) @xmath69 captures the steep rise in @xmath66 with decreasing cooling rate , 2 ) @xmath69 is in the region of @xmath60 between the two peaks in @xmath59 that occur at intermediate cooling rates ( right inset of left panel of fig .",

    "the value of the bond orientational order parameter depends on the crystal structure that forms during the thermal quenching process .",
