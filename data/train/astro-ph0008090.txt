    "to investigate whether the observed soft excess of photons , compared to the absorbed nuclear power law , is indeed due to genuine emission and not instead to an artifact due to additional complexity in the geometrical or physical status of the matter covering our line of sight to pds  456 , a few different spectral models were tested .",
    "more specifically , the soft x ",
    "ray power law was eliminated and the full - covering neutral absorber was either replaced by a partial covering absorber , allowing a fraction of the nuclear radiation to escape unabsorbed , or by a mildly ionized absorber transparent at energies lower than @xmath67 kev .",
    "none of these models was able to provide good quality fits to our data .",
    "we also replaced the soft power law with thermal emission from a collisionally ionized plasma , and refitted the data .",
    "this did not modify the best - fit parameters of the remaining spectral components , nor improved further the quality of the fit , compared to model b. moreover , a significant contribution to the soft x ",
    "rays from starburst emission is unlikely .",
    "indeed , given a 60100 @xmath68 m luminosity of 610 @xmath2 10@xmath69 erg @xmath4 s@xmath11 ( depending on the assumed ir spectral slope ) and relation [ 2 ] in david et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , only about 5 % of the soft x ",
    "ray emission may be due to star - forming emission .",
    "we then conclude that pds  456 shows genuine soft x ",
    "ray emission below @xmath70 kev .",
    "such a component is likely to be related to the strong uv bump present in the multiwavelength energy distribution ( reeves et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the energy and optical depth of the absorption edge in model b strongly suggest the presence of highly ionized gas absorbing and/or reflecting the primary radiation . to verify this hypothesys",
    "we then replaced the photoelectric edge in model b , with either an ionized reflector ( parameterized by the model pexriv in xspec , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 : model * c * ) or an ionized absorber ( using the cloudy - ferland 1996 - based model described in nicastro et al . 2000a , and adopting the mathews & ferland 1987 parameterization for the agn continuum : model * d * ) , and refitted the data . in both cases we left the soft and the hard , reflected / absorbed , power law free to vary independently .",
    "both parameterizations gave acceptable @xmath28 .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 were consistent with each other between the two parameterizations .",
    "the hard reflected / absorbed continuum ( @xmath64 @xmath6 1.41.6 ) is still much flatter than the soft x  ray power law . finally , the best - fit ionization parameters are consistent with each others , and their values correspond to a very high ionization state of the matter reflecting / absorbing the nuclear radiation , with iron mainly distributed among species xxi and xxvii . both models",
    "provide then an acceptable description of our data .",
    "however , according to matt , fabian & ross ( 1993 ) , such a high ionized reflector should produce strong ( ew @xmath6 300500 ev ) fluorescence iron k@xmath0 emission lines at 6.76.97 kev .",
    "these lines are not observed in our data , the 90 % upper limits on their equivalent width being of 120 , 115 and 80 ev for neutral , he  like and h  like ionic species respectively .",
    "the corresponding 3@xmath73 limits lie in the range 150180 ev .",
    "we then conclude that , while statistically acceptable , the model including an ionized reflector is not fully consistent with the bepposax data of pds  456 .",
    "k@xmath0 emission from highly ionized iron is instead not expected to be strong in the case of an ionized absorber .",
    "the predicted strength of these lines depends on the fraction of solid angle covered by the absorber ( as seen by the central source ) , and on the dynamics of the gas ( see  4 ) , but does not exceed few tens of ev for the strongest line , fully compatible with our data .",
    "a spectrum transmitted by a high column ( @xmath74 @xmath17 4.5 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) of highly ionized matter would then self - consistently account for both the observed deep absorption fexxiv - xxvi k edge and the absence of k@xmath0 line emission from the same iron species ( model d , table 1 ) .",
    "the best - fit spectrum gives a 210 kev flux of about 5.7 @xmath2 10@xmath75 erg s@xmath11 @xmath4 , which corresponds to an intrinsic 210 kev luminosity of about 1.2 @xmath2 10@xmath69 erg s@xmath11 . at this flux level and given the relatively short exposure time , the source has not been detected at high energies by the pds instrument ( which spends about half of the time to monitor the background ) .",
    "in fact , a 3@xmath73 detection would have been possible only for a power law harder that @xmath64 @xmath17 1.3 ( guainazzi & matteuzzi 1997 ) .",
    "the present upper limit provides therefore only a loose contraint on the high energy spectrum .",
    "pds  456 was observed by the asca satellite ( tanaka et al .",
    "1994 ) on 1998 march 7 during the ao6 phase .",
    "the focal plane instruments consist of two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis , gendreau 1995 ) and two gas scintillation imaging spectrometers ( gis , makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) , characterized by a good spectral resolution ( about 2 % and @xmath6 8 % at 5.9 kev , respectively ) and broad - band ( @xmath6 0.610 kev ) capabilities .",
    "the observations were performed in faint mode and then corrected for dark frame error and echo uncertainties as suggested by otani & dotani ( 1994 ) .",
    "the data were screened with the version 1.4b of the xselect package with standard criteria .",
    "the final observing time is about 41 ks for both sis and gis detectors .",
    "source counts were extracted from circles of 6@xmath23 radius for gis and 3@xmath23.5 for sis centered on the source , and background spectra were extracted from source - free regions from the same ccd chip for sis and from the same field of view for gis . the source count rates ( after background - subtraction ) are 6.90@xmath76 @xmath2 10@xmath25 and 6.13@xmath76 @xmath2 10@xmath25 counts per second for sis and gis , respectively .",
    "sis and gis data were fitted simultaneously allowing the relative normalizations to be free to vary , to account for residual discrepancies in the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the residuals of a single power law fit ( @xmath77 , fig .",
    "5 ) are similar to those of bepposax and fully consistent with the results reported by reeves & turner ( 2000 ) in their analysis of the same asca data .",
    "in particular , a soft excess and an edge appear prominently . no emission line has been detected .",
    "the 90 % upper limits for the neutral , he  like and h  like lines are in the 4570 ev range while , the 3@xmath73 upper limits are of the order of 100130 ev .",
    "the presence of an ionized edge is fully confirmed by asca data ( @xmath27/@xmath61dof = 47/2 with respect to a single power law model ) .",
    "the edge spectral parameters are consistent with the bepposax observation but less constrained due to the lower asca effective area at e @xmath20 7 kev . at low - energies , the spectrum clearly shows a soft component .",
    "the addition of a power law improves the fit .",
    "looking for consistency between the bepposax and the asca data of pds  456 , we then fitted our chosen parameterization of the bepposax data ( model d ) to the asca data . the edge is fully accounted for by this model .",
    "both the ionization parameter and the warm absorbing column density are in agreement with bepposax values .",
    "the asca data require a steeper spectral slope ( @xmath78 @xmath17 1.62.0 ) and a moderately lower neutral column density , but consistent , within the errors , with the bepposax results .",
    "asca and bepposax observations of pds  456 were taken about 5 months ( observer frame ) apart .",
    "the flux level of the source was lower during the asca observation ( f@xmath79 @xmath17 3.6 @xmath2 10@xmath75 erg @xmath4 s@xmath11 ) than during the bepposax one ( f@xmath79 @xmath17 5.7 @xmath2 10@xmath75 erg @xmath4 s@xmath11 ) .",
    "a 50 % flux variation over 3 days has been detected by rxte during a quasi  simultaneous observation with asca .",
    "the rxte range of fluxes encompass the asca and bepposax measurements .",
    "in addition , a strong flare with a doubling time of about 17 ksec is present in the rxte observation ( reeves et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the underlying continuum of the asca / rxte spectrum ( @xmath8 2.32.4 ) is steeper than the slope obtained from the present analysis of bepposax and asca data and from the independent analysis of the asca spectrum discussed in reeves & turner ( 2000 ) .",
    "the origin of such a discrepancy is unclear .",
    "intercalibration errors between rxte and asca and/or a significant steepening of the continuum spectrum above 10 kev may provide a plausible explanation .",
    "the presence of a prominent ionized iron k edge , with similar values for the best - fit energy and optical depth in rxte and bepposax data , represents the most striking observed feature in pds 456 and unambiguosly points to a highly ionized nuclear environment in this quasar .",
    "the edge parameters are equally well reproduced by either reflection off or transmission through a highly ionized gas . in the first case the ionization status inferred from the edge energy would imply a strong ( @xmath6 300500 ev ; matt et al .",
    "1993 ) ionized ( 6.76.97 kev ) iron line .",
    "if the edge originates in a high column density ( n@xmath16 a few 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) warm gas , no strong iron line is expected ( see below ) .",
    "the bepposax and asca upper limits on the line intensity derived from the present analysis would then favour a transmission model . on the other hand ,",
    "the tentative detection of a broad iron line in the rxte data ( @xmath80 1 kev , ew @xmath6 350 ev ) would instead favour the reflection scenario ( reeves et al .",
    "2000 ) .    to further investigate the properties of the high column density , highly ionized absorber",
    "we have carried out more detailed calculations using the photoionization models described in nicastro , fiore and matt ( 1999 ) and nicastro et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , which includes photoelectric and resonant absorption as well as gas emission .",
    "the best - fit value of the ionization parameter implies that the iron atoms are equally distributed among the 3 highest ionization states : ( @xmath6 30 % ) , ( @xmath6 40 % ) and ( i.e. fully ionized , @xmath6 30 % ) . in a spherical configuration ,",
    "the net intensity of the corresponding emission lines depends ( a ) on the fraction of solid angle ( as seen by the central source ) covered by the absorber / emitter , and ( b ) the ratio between the outflowing ( @xmath81 ) and the turbolence ( @xmath82 ) gas velocities .",
    "we then ran our models for different values of the covering factor between 0.1 and 1 . to maximize the net contribute of line emission , compared to absorption , we used @xmath81/@xmath82 = 5 , which guarantees a peak - to - peak separation of absorption and emission lines by the same transition greater than 3 times the width of these features ( nicastro et al .",
    ". the rather uncertain knowledge of the dynamical status of the gas prevents us from a more detailed treatment .",
    "the results indicate that the total equivalent width of the line blend ( including recombination , fluorescent and intercombination lines ) never exceeds @xmath6100 ev , a value lower than the upper limits derived from asca and bepposax data , leading further support to the transmission model .",
    "finally , the 0.1 - 2 kev continuum - plus - line fluxes predicted by these models allowed us to estimate the maximum contribution of gas emission to the soft component measured in both the bepposax and asca data to be not larger than @xmath6 20 % .",
    "the most important results obtained from the bepposax observation of the luminous quasar pds  456 can be summarized as follows :    * the bepposax observation confirms the presence of a deep ionized k edge discovered by rxte at @xmath6 8.59 kev implying the presence of highly ionized gas around the central source . + * the absence of significant iron line emission in both the bepposax and asca data favours a model where the hard x  ray continuum is absorbed by a high column density of highly ionized gas .",
    "further spectral complexity is present at lower energies , requiring the presence of an additional cold ( or weakly ionized ) absorber . + * the high luminosity of pds  456 ( @xmath83 @xmath6 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath11 ) and the properties of the absorbing medium which partially hides the x  ray source make this object a good candidate to test the emission mechanisms and reprocessing in quasars .",
    "+    further investigations with chandra and xmm would be extremely helpful to assess the nature of the x  ray emission ( both in the soft and in hard x  rays domain ) and the ionization state of the absorbing matter .",
    "moreover , x  ray spectroscopy of others bright , relatively nearby quasars would be very important to check whether pds 456 is an exceptional object or the imprints of highly ionized high column density gas are common in luminous quasars",
