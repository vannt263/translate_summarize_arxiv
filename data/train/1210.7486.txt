    "despite the increasing growth of knowledge about magnetic ordering in ultrathin magnetic films during the last decade , both from experimental @xcite and theoretical works@xcite , there are still many open questions , specially regarding its finite temperature behavior .",
    "one of the main obstacles to advance in these studies is the long range character of the dipolar interactions , which are fundamental to explain pattern formation in those systems . in particular numerical simulations , although have been of great aid@xcite , are strongly limited by finite size effects . to avoid them",
    ", system size must be large enough to contain a large number of domains .",
    "the main problem relies not on the direct influence of dipolar interactions on the boundary conditions , but on the fact that the basic spatial scale for these systems , namely the typical domain size , scales exponentially with the exchange to dipolar couplings ratio @xmath0 at very low temperatures@xcite , and roughly linear with @xmath0 close to the transition to a disordered state@xcite .",
    "typical values of @xmath0 in ultrathin magnetic films , like fe based films , are around@xcite @xmath1 , thus implying the necessity of very large system sizes to acommodate a reasonable number of domains . to perform simulations with those sizes",
    "represents up to now , even in the best case ( close to the transition ) , a formidable task .",
    "therefore , knowledge about how the different thermodynamical properties scale with @xmath0 would be very helpful to estimate whether the numerical results for relatively small values of @xmath0 ( typically between @xmath2 and @xmath3 up to now ) can be extrapolated to more realistic values .    for the analysis of the magnetic properties of ultrathin films ,",
    "the out of plane anisotropy to dipolar coupling @xmath4 is also important .",
    "the system behaviour appears to be strongly dependent on experimental features that modify it , such as the film thickness and the sample preparation conditions .",
    "a strong dependence is also observed in numerical simulations for@xcite @xmath5 .",
    "for low @xmath4 values , a srt from a uniformly magnetized planar phase into a perpendicular striped phase can happen at finite temperature t ( in the absence of an external field ) , in agreement with a previous theoretical prediction@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for high values of @xmath4 there is no planar ferromagnetic phase and the system undergoes a direct transition from the striped state into a disordered one . from these numerical results a global @xmath6 phase diagram was obtained , that is in qualitative agreement with a variety of experimental results@xcite . however , for such a small value of @xmath0 certain features can be very different from that expected for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , at zero temperature the striped equilibrium state for @xmath4 above certain critical value @xmath7 ( where the srt occurs ) is characterized by a stripe width almost independent of @xmath4 for @xmath8 . on the contrary , for values of @xmath9 , a strong variation of the equilibrium stripe width with @xmath4",
    "emerges when@xcite @xmath10 .",
    "another feature that depends strongly on the interplay between exchange and anisotropy is the structure of the magnetization pattern close to the srt . at zero temperature and close to the srt ,",
    "the out of plane component of the magnetization presents an almost sinusoidal shape with a large in  plane component , displaying a canted structure@xcite . for small values of @xmath0 ( @xmath11 )",
    "such structure remains for a relatively large interval of values of @xmath4 above the srt and changes abruptly to a completely perpendicular striped state with sharp domain walls ( ising like state ) .",
    "consistently , numerical evidences of a canted structure with a sinusoidally shaped magnetization profile close to the srt at finite temperature has been recently reported@xcite for @xmath12 . however , as @xmath0 increases the range of anisotropy values at which such canted state is present shrinks at zero temperature@xcite , becoming almost negligible for realistic values of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , it is not clear whether it is expected to be relevant at finite temperature or not .    in this work",
    "we analyze the finite temperature phase diagram in the low anisotropy region ( close to the srt ) and several related properties using a coarse  grained based mean field model for ultrathin magnetic films and monte carlo simulations on a microscopic model .",
    "the main objective of the paper is to discuss which of the observed features of the phase diagram for low values of @xmath0 are expected to reflect the large @xmath0 behavior .",
    "several properties stripes patterns are also analyzed .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ mf ] we introduce the coarse grained model and calculate the associated mean field phase diagram . in section [ mc ]",
    "we present monte carlo simulations results for a heisenberg model and compare them with the previous ones . in section [ conc ]",
    "we discuss our results .",

    "the temperature dependency comes through @xmath19 .    in order to minimize eq.([hreal ] ) , we propose a variational stripe like solution , i.e. , a modulated solution along the @xmath20 direction , where only bloch walls between domains are allowed@xcite , namely @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we also assume that modulus of the magnetization is uniform , i.e.    @xmath23    this approximation is expected to breakdown for large enough values of @xmath4 , where the statistical weight of spin configurations with large in plane components tends to zero , but non uniform out of plane configurations are still expected to minimize the free energy@xcite .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath24 limit the whole effective free energy ( [ hreal ] ) cease to be valid , being replaced by a functional of a scalar order parameter ( local out of plane magnetization ) , without the anisotropy term@xcite .    under the present assumptions ,",
    "the following form of the dipolar term can be assumed@xcite    @xmath25    where we have neglected the self energy term arising from the dipolar energy , since it just implies a constant shift in the anisotropy coefficient @xmath4 .",

    "its minimal energy configuration as a function of the microscopic parameters @xmath35 can be described by variational expressions characterized by different sets of variational parameters @xmath36 that will be described later .",
    "minimization of the free energy eq.([fvar ] ) leads to :    @xmath37    we also have ; @xmath38    @xmath39    and @xmath40 @xmath41 is always a solution of the extremal equations ( [ firstderivm])-([firstderivp ] ) and the corresponding free energy @xmath42 is independent of the parameter values of @xmath43 .",
    "hence , all the second derivatives are zero , except    @xmath44    which controls the stability of the @xmath41 solution .",
    "an ordered solution ( local minimum of @xmath45 ) with @xmath46 exists whenever @xmath47 . from eqs.([firstderivm])-([firstderivp ] ) we have that :    @xmath48    and @xmath49    hence , from eqs.([2ndderivm ] ) and ( [ mmf ] ) it follows that ,    @xmath50    and from eqs.([2ndderiv1 ] ) and ( [ mmf2 ] ) , @xmath51    then , the hessian matrix of @xmath45 has a positive eigenvalue @xmath52 and a diagonal block that equals @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the hessian matrix of @xmath55 . therefore , a local minimum of @xmath45 has to be a local minimum of @xmath55 .",
    "the free energy of an ordered phase is :    @xmath56    the extremal properties of @xmath55 are well known@xcite . for low values of the anisotropy @xmath4 the minimum of @xmath55 corresponds to a planar ferromagnetic ( pf ) configuration @xmath57 . above certain critical value@xcite @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath55 is minimized by a striped profile with periodicity @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the stripe width ) .",
    "close to @xmath7 the domain structure corresponds to a canted sinusoidal wall profile ( swp ) , where @xmath61 is constant inside the striped domains ( @xmath62 is the canting angle ) and presents a sinusoidal structured wall of width@xcite @xmath63 .",
    "the energy of the swp is given by    @xmath64    where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , a @xmath67 , and@xcite    @xmath68    different approximations of high accuracy for @xmath69 are available@xcite , so the values of @xmath70 that minimize eq.([eyg ] ) can be found numerically for arbitrary values of @xmath35 .",
    "as the value of @xmath4 is raised above @xmath7 the canting angle decreases fast from @xmath71 at @xmath72 to @xmath73 and the striped pattern that minimizes @xmath55 changes to a hyperbolic wall magnetization profile ( hpw ) whose energy is given by@xcite    @xmath74    where @xmath75 , with @xmath76 .",
    "eq.([ehpw ] ) can be easily minimized@xcite    if @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , the global minimum of @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , that is , to a planar ferromagnetic ( pf ) state with free energy @xmath82 . when @xmath83 and @xmath78 the system undergoes a second order phase transition between the paramagnetic state and the pf one , independently of @xmath4 .",
    "we will assume hereafter that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the paramagnetic to pf transition temperature .    when @xmath86 and @xmath87 the swp configuration with free energy given by eq.([fordered ] ) is the stable solution for values of @xmath4 close to @xmath7 .",
    "since the striped order emerges continuously , the srt at @xmath72 , according to the present approximation , is a second order one . as @xmath4",
    "is further increased there is an energy crossing at certain value of @xmath4 and the stable configuration changes into an hwp .",
    "hence , for @xmath88 the stable configuration is a canted striped one , while for @xmath89 the stripes are fully saturated in the out of plane direction inside the domains ( we will call this state an `` ising striped configuration '' ) .    if @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) and @xmath10 the global minimum corresponds to the modulated phase when @xmath92 , i.e. @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , there is a transition line at @xmath94 .",
    "the order parameter changes continuously at @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , but @xmath97 changes discontinuously . in fig.[pd1 ] we illustrate the typical topology of the phase diagram for the particular case @xmath98 .",
    "all the solid lines in [ pd1 ] correspond to second order phase transitions .",
    "we also show the crossover line between the region where the magnetization profile shows a significative canting angle ( canted stripes ) and the region where the local magnetization is almost perpendicular to the plane ( perpendicular stripes ) .",
    "although the paramagnetic solution is not a global minimum of @xmath45 when @xmath10 and @xmath90 , it could be still a local minimum provided that @xmath99 for some values of @xmath97 and @xmath100 . from eq.([stabm0 ] ) , such condition ensures the local stability against variations of @xmath101 .",
    "however , since all the rest of the second derivatives cancel , the complete stability of the paramagnetic solution is beyond the linear analysis .",
    "we verified numerically that indeed the paramagnetic phase remains locally stable ( metastable ) below @xmath102 at fixed @xmath10 .",
    "such metastability is a result of the high degeneracy of the paramagnetic solution under the present approximation , so it appears to be a spurious result .",
    "however , it can be indicative of a change in the order of the transition if the approximation is improved .",
    "indeed , there are several evidences towards the first order nature of the stripes - disordered phase transition @xcite .",
    "in order to compare the mean field results with the behavior of a specific microscopic model , we performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations using a heisenberg model with exchange and dipolar interactions , as well as uniaxial out of plane anisotropy .",

    "in order to find the equilibrium phase diagram , we carried out the simulations with two protocols for the independent parameter ( temperature , anisotropy or external field ) . in the first protocol , we varied the independent parameter linearly with the simulation time , increasing or decreasing it at a given rate @xmath124 , keeping the rest of the parameters fixed .",

    "the effective free energy @xmath198 $ ] is then the order zero term in an expansion of @xmath197 $ ] around its minimum when fluctuations are neglected . if the @xmath24 limit is taken _ a priori _ of such expansion , all the configurations with non zero in plane magnetization components get zero statistical weight and a different landau ginzburg free energy ( which depends only on the scalar field @xmath199 ) is obtained@xcite .",
    "therefore , the correct stripe - paramagnet critical temperature must converge to the ( @xmath4-independent ) value predicted by the last free energy when @xmath200 .",
    "in other words , even within the mean field theory the correct behavior can not be obtained as the @xmath24 limit of the present approach .    while the previous difference ( vertical line vs. finite slope ) between the mc and the mf phase diagrams is particular of the present approach , some others appear to be associated to general features of the mean field theory .",
    "for instance , the transition line between the planar ferromagnet and the canted - stripe phases computed within the mf approximation is horizontal , while it shows a finite slope when extracted from mc simulations .",
    "this seems to be a direct effect of neglecting thermal fluctuations , since theoretical works show that those fluctuations renormalize the dipolar and anisotropy coupling parameters in such a way that the anisotropy @xmath201 diminishes faster than the dipolar coupling constant@xcite @xmath202 ( in our notation,@xmath203 ) .",
    "those works predict a linear dependence of the reorientation transition temperature with anisotropy with positive slope , which is roughly in agreement with the transition lines obtained from mc simulations .",
    "finally , the transition line between the planar ferromagnet and the paramagnetic phases is a vertical straight line in mf diagram while it shows some slope in the mc diagram .",
    "this is because of the simplifying assumption that the ( coarse grained ) phenomenological transition temperature @xmath85 is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "while the tendency of the transition line in the mc diagram suggests that this assumption may appropriately describe the very low @xmath4 limit , it clearly fails for large enough values of @xmath4 .",
    "an increase in the perpendicular anisotropy should destabilize the planar ferromagnetic phase , thus decreasing the critical temperature .",
    "one fact that emerges , both from our mean field and monte carlo results , is the strong influence of the ground state properties on the finite temperature behavior close to the srt .",
    "one example is the presence of canted states close to the srt line . comparing with previous mc results for@xcite @xmath12 ,",
    "the phase diagram canted region becomes wider for @xmath98 , consistently with the zero temperature phase diagram@xcite .",
    "however , the range of values of @xmath4 where the ground state canted angle is different from zero becomes extremely narrow as @xmath0 is further increased .",
    "hence , our mean field results suggest that those states would be present at finite temperature only very close to the srt line for any realistic value of @xmath0 .",
    "another example is the stripe width variation and the magnetization stripes profile change with @xmath4 , that closely follow the zero temperature behavior@xcite .",
    "moreover , the qualitative agreement between our mc simulations on wedges and experimental results on fe / ni ultrathin films@xcite supports inverse relationship between out of plane anisotropy and film thickness @xmath185 .",
    "the correlation between the stripe width variation with the temperature and with the anisotropy observed close to the srt in the present simulations is another interesting fact .",
    "as previously pointed out@xcite , varying the film thickness ( always in the ultrathin limit ) produces a similar effect as changing the temperature , thus leading to an `` inverse effective temperature '' interpretation of the thickness@xcite . considering the relation @xmath185 , this appears to be consistent with the similarity observed between the change in the magnetization profile when @xmath4 is varied and that observed in fe films when the temperature is varied@xcite .",
    "such set of similarities suggest that a deeper analysis about the interplay between temperature and anisotropy could shed an additional light about the origin of the strong stripe width variation with temperature observed in ultrathin magnetic films ."
