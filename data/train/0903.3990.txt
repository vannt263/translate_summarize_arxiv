    "a variety of essential physical processes , ranging from ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite to the reheating period and phase transitions in the early universe @xcite , proceed at least initially far from thermodynamic equilibrium and involve abundantly manynonperturbative degrees of freedom .",
    "the first - principle based theoretical treatment of such phenomena , which require a quantum field theoretic description but are inaccessible to euclidean lattice simulations , is as a rule beyond present capabilities .",
    "important exceptions to this rule arise , however , if the underlying amplitudes receive dominant contributions from classical fields .",
    "the latter may be provided , in particular , by bosonic long - wavelength modes at high temperature @xmath1 and with energies @xmath2 since the bose - einstein distribution supplies them with the large occupation numbers needed to ensure ( semi- ) classical behavior . in non - abelian gauge theories , observables governed by such classical modes",
    "are typically of @xmath3 in the weak - coupling regime ( where @xmath4 is the gauge coupling and @xmath5 sets an inverse classical length scale ) and have a finite classical limit .",
    "prominent examples include the transport coefficients which control magnetic screening @xcite and color diffusion @xcite , and in particular the static plasmon damping rate @xcite .",
    "the latter has direct impact on the local energy and momentum equilibration processes among hot gauge - field quanta , which were found to occur over surprisingly short times of less than 1 fm/@xmath6 in the excited matter created by ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions at rhic hei04,pis08 .",
    "essentially classical nonequilibrium observables of the above type may therefore be calculated by relating them to real - time  evolution properties of classical long - wavelength gauge fields and by simulating those nonperturbatively on a spacial lattice @xcite . along these lines ,",
    "the plasmon damping rate was argued to be proportional to the classical gluon damping rate and , at least at weak coupling , further to the maximal  lyapunov exponent ( mle ) which governs the exponential separation rate between initially neighboring  random gauge - field configurations mul92,bir95 .",
    "the underlying reasoning is based on the expected ergodicity of the classical field trajectories and on the relation between exponential growth and damping rates provided by time reversal symmetry @xcite . in the weak - coupling region , furthermore , these relations can be tested quantitatively by comparison with results from partially resummed thermal perturbation theory or alternatively from kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "following up on the above arguments , the present paper will deal with the real - time evolution of classical su@xmath0 yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory on spacial lattices of various sizes",
    ". a particular focus will be on the role of the scalar and hence classically treatable matter fields , provided by the fundamental higgs doublet , in the chaotic dynamics .",
    "the center piece of the analysis is a systematic survey of the energy and coupling dependence of a set of maximal lyapunov exponents designed to cover representative parts of the weakly coupled ymh phase space .",
    "since our theory corresponds to the electroweak sector of the standard model with vanishing weinberg angle , the resulting mles contain information which may be useful for understanding cosmological nonequilibrium processes during semiclassical evolution phases of the early universe , including topological  structure formation , baryogenesis @xcite and potentially cosmic string evolution @xcite .",
    "moreover , our results will be relevant for the analysis of local equilibration processes in the highly excited matter produced at the rhic @xcite and soon the cern lhc @xcite colliders .",
    "indeed , the chaoticity of the gauge dynamics provides a natural mechanism for entropy production by soft fields ( and the accompanying particle production in the quantum case ) , and its most unstable field modes contribute dominantly to equilibration processes",
    ". in particular , our results will give rise to new estimates for the energy and coupling dependence of the gauge - field damping rate in the presence of scalar matter .",
    "furthermore , the mles should receive contributions from the non - abelian plasma instabilities which were recently argued to accelerate the isotropization and thermalization processes in the aftermath of high - energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the underlying unstable modes could in principle be isolated by numerical techniques similar to ours . as in chaotic inflation scenarios ,",
    "furthermore , such instabilities typically generate nonperturbatively large occupation numbers , which may extend the reliability of our classical treatment to larger couplings and lower temperatures",
    ". some of our qualitative results may even be robust enough to provide guidance on the impact of fundamental quark fields .",
    "although our main focus will be on the evolution of random fields , we also study the impact of the higgs fields on the instability of a constant non - abelian magnetic field .",
    "the employed techniques may later be applied to more complex coherent fields , including classical solutions of ymh theory @xcite and gauge - invariant coherent soft modes @xcite .",
    "studies of this type could provide new insights into the corresponding quantum theories . applied to multimonopole configurations of ymh theory with an adjoint higgs field , whose chaotic interactions we have recently studied @xcite",
    ", they may for example help to clarify the role of chaotic monopole ensembles in disordering the gauge - theory vacuum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ymhlat ] we summarize the formulation of su@xmath0 ymh theory on a hamiltonian lattice , derive the corresponding field equations and discuss suitable distance measures on the space of gauge and higgs field configurations .",
    "section quant outlines the main ingredients of our numerical analysis , examines finite - time and finite - size effects , discusses the time evolution of the energy transfer between  the various field sectors , and evaluates the rate of divergence between initially neighboring random field configurations at intermediate times . on this basis , we generate in sec .",
    "[ lyaetal ] a representative set of maximal lyapunov exponents , discuss their energy dependence and relation to the plasmon damping rate , then extend the analysis by calculating a set of long - time lyapunov histories , and finally evaluate the impact of the higgs fields on the savvidy instability of constant non - abelian magnetic fields .",
    "[ impl ] puts our results into context by discussing related nonequlibrium processes in the early universe and in the aftermath of high - energy nuclear collisions , and sec .",
    "[ sum ] summarizes our main findings and provides some conclusions .",
    "in order to identify and measure chaotic properties of a dynamical system , one has to follow the evolution of its dynamical variables over sufficiently long periods of time .",
    "a numerical treatment of field theories further requires to approximate space by a discrete lattice .",
    "the analogous handling of the time variable ( as typically implemented in euclidean spacetime subject to periodic boundary conditions ) is unsuitable for chaos investigations , however , since it would unacceptably restrict the accessible evolution times .",
    "hence we resort to the hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory @xcite in minkowski space where gauge fields are restricted to temporal gauge and time remains an unbounded and ( in principle ) continuous variable .",
    "a further benefit of this formulation is that residual  gauge symmetries enforced by gauss law can be accurately preserved during time evolution . in the following subsections",
    "we briefly summarize this approach as it applies to ymh theory and define the distance measures needed to determine the lyapunov exponents .",
    "( more details can be found e.g. in refs . @xcite . )      in the following section we outline pertinent aspects of the hamiltonian formulation of 3 + 1 dimensional su@xmath0 yang - mills - higgs theory on a spacial cubic lattice subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "since the higgs field @xmath7 is taken to transform in the fundamental representation of the gauge group , this theory is equivalent to  the electroweak sector of the standard model in the limit of vanishing weinberg angle .",
    "the gauge is fixed to @xmath8 , i.e. to weyl gauge . the unbroken phase corresponding to a gauge - matter plasma is selected by positive higgs mass and interaction terms , which allows for comparison of the results with ( hard - thermal - loop resummed ) perturbative results at high temperature below .",
    "the corresponding ymh hamiltonian can thus be written as@xmath9    \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath4 is the gauge coupling , @xmath10 the higgs self - coupling , @xmath11 the lattice spacing and dots denote time derivatives .",
    "the non - abelian magnetic field is described by the spacial plaquette@xmath12(with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , i.e. by the ordered minimal - circumference loop constructed from the link variables @xmath15where @xmath16 is the gauge field and @xmath17 with @xmath18 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the @xmath19 are defined on the link which connects the site @xmath20 with its neighbor in the positive @xmath21 direction .",
    "hence the spacial plaquettes contain the non - abelian magnetic field strength components @xmath22 $ ] while their electric counterparts @xmath23 are independent variables .",
    "the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) therefore describes the energy residing in the electric fields while the second term , @xmath24approaches the magnetic or potential energy of the gauge field in the naivecontinuum limit .    for the numerical implementation of the su@xmath0 link variables",
    "we have adopted the quaternion representation@xmath25(the indices @xmath26 are suppressed ) whose real components @xmath27 @xmath28 satisfy the constraint @xmath29 and thereby ensure unitarity @xmath30 as well .",
    "the @xmath31 are thus ( four dimensional , cartesian ) coordinates on the su@xmath0 group manifold @xmath32 .",
    "the representation ( [ quat ] ) leads to simple field equations ( cf .",
    "[ eom ] ) and requires the minimal number of floating point operations to calculate the product @xmath33 of two link variables . in order to state the initial conditions for the time evolution of the gauge field , however , we prefer the alternative representation of the link variable as a rotation of angle @xmath34 around the direction @xmath35 , i.e.@xmath36(suppressing again the indices ) . in terms of the polar angles",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 one then has @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 . the higgs field",
    "@xmath44 in the fundamental representation of the gauge group is written in an analogous quaternion representation,@xmath45 ,   \\label{h}\\]]where the polar decomposition again turns out to be more suitable for stating the initial conditions ( cf . sec .",
    "[ init ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the unitary link variables @xmath46 , however , the ( square ) modulus@xmath47of the higgs field remains unconstrained .",
    "exploiting its ( classical ) scaling properties , the ymh hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be reexpressed in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 as@xmath53    \\label{ham2}\\]]with the dimensionless energy densities@xmath54 ^{2 } , \\label{ehp}\\end{aligned}\\]]where the fields are now functions of @xmath55 and dots represent @xmath56 .",

    "the ymh  hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) generates the classical time evolution of electric , magnetic and higgs fields .",
    "this becomes explicit in the corresponding first - order hamilton equations which we derive with the help of the poisson brackets@xmath59of the dynamical variables @xmath60 with the hamiltonian @xmath57 ( where @xmath61 are the canonically conjugate variables and summation over @xmath62 is implied ) .",

    "( [ eqn : emppd ] ) , into @xmath77    finally , we recall that the full ymh dynamics in temporal gauge is only recovered after supplementing hamilton s equations ( [ eqn : emq ] ) , ( eme ) and ( [ eqn : emphi ] ) by gauss law@xmath78 = \\bar{\\rho}_{x}^{a }   \\label{gss}\\]]which acts as a constraint . since its poisson bracket with the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) vanishes , gauss law is preserved under time evolution .",
    "above , we have defined the dimensionless non - abelian charge density @xmath79   \\label{j}\\]]carried by the higgs field .",
    "the chaotic behavior of dynamical systems reveals itself in an exponential sensitivity of their time evolution to small changes in the initial conditions .",
    "the quantitative characterization of this sensitivity requires a distance measure on the field configuration space ( i.e. a metric ) .",
    "more specifically , in the ymh system one has to monitor the separation between a reference configuration @xmath80 and its neighbor @xmath81 .",
    "we will use individual distance measures in the gauge and higgs sectors for this purpose , in order to determine the distance growth rate between two initially nearby gauge and higgs field configurations individually .    in the gauge sector , we adopt the gauge - invariant metric @xcite @xmath82=\\frac{1}{2n_{\\text{p}}}% \\sum_{p}\\,\\left\\vert tru_{p}-tru_{p}^{\\prime } \\right\\vert    \\label{du}\\]](where @xmath83 is the total number of plaquettes on a lattice with @xmath84 sites per spacial dimension ) to measure the distance between gauge - field configurations . in the continuum limit the distance measured by the metric ( [ du ] ) becomes proportional to the difference between the potential energies of reference and neighboring gauge fields . in the higgs sector we employ the metric @xcite @xmath85=\\frac{1}{n^{3}}\\sum_{x}\\,\\left\\vert \\left ( r_{x}\\right ) ^{2}-\\left ( r_{x}^{\\prime } \\right ) ^{2}\\right\\vert   \\label{dh}\\]]which is gauge invariant as well .",
    "since the lattice gauge group , and consequently the @xmath86 dimensional space of magnetic su@xmath87 gauge - field configurations on a lattice with @xmath84 sites per dimension , is compact and of nontrivial topology , more and more field configurations approach the same distance @xmath88 when @xmath84 increases . for the same reason , the distance ( [ du ] ) is bounded from above , and for fixed total energy an analogous bound applies to the whole phase space . * *  * * these bounds lead to an eventual saturation of the distance growth .",
    "although this does not limit the principal effectiveness of the measures @xmath89 for determining the lyapunov exponents ( see below ) , it adds to the typical finite - time  uncertainties encountered in their numerical analysis .",
    "other sources of finite - time errors arise from the need to extrapolate the numerical results to the @xmath90 limit in which the mles are formally defined , and for @xmath91 from the exponentially growing distances between chaotic trajectories which eventually overburden the floating point number representation capacities of any computer .",
    "the standard approach for keeping finite - time errors of mles under control is to periodically rescale the distances @xcite after time intervals @xmath92 and to extrapolate the numerical results for @xmath93 to infinite times .",

    "@xcite , in the higgs sector .",
    "of course , the resulting lyapunov exponents should not depend on the choice of distance measure .",
    "we have checked this for several examples and confirmed that the deviations between the mle values obtained from the metrics ( [ du ] ) , ( dh ) and ( [ du2 ] ) , ( [ dh2 ] ) indeed remain well below the one - percent level .",
    "nevertheless , even under rescaling the practically achievable evolution times remain limited by the available computer resources .",
    "in fact , even in pure su@xmath0 yang - mills theory @xcite systematic extrapolation errors turned out to become negligible only after evolution times of the order of @xmath96 lattice units . to make matters worse",
    ", we will find below that the equilibration between gauge and higgs fields proceeds at a far slower pace than among the gauge fields alone ( cf .",
    "[ edistr ] ) , and that as a consequence substantially longer evolution times are required to suppress such extrapolation errors in ymh theory .",
    "adherence to one of our main goals , namely to calculate a rather exhaustive set of mles in the weak - coupling parameter and phase space , will therefore require a compromise .",
    "indeed , to cover the relevant initial parameter space ( on lattices of several different sizes ) requires the calculation of @xmath97 trajectory pairs and thus forces us to limit the individual evolution times .",
    "fortunately , size and systematics of finite - time errors can be estimated on the basis of the long - time energy balance ( cf .",
    "[ edistr ] ) and a few long - time orbits ( cf .",
    "[ ltevol ] ) .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the systematic energy- , coupling- and lattice - size dependence of the mles ( rather than in their precise numerical values ) , furthermore , the competing goals of error suppression and calculability can be reconciled reasonably well .",
    "our compromise will be to follow the majority of our distance histories only until they have saturated ( without rescaling ) , which yields sufficiently accurate mle estimates for most of our purposes .",
    "rescaling will be used , on the other hand , for the long - time trajectories which we need to examine the energy transfer and equilibration processes between the gauge and higgs field sectors in sec .",

    "in the following section we discuss in turn the initialization of the neighboring field configurations , the distribution of the total energy over the different field sectors , and the time evolution of the distance between initially adjacent field configurations .      our first task will be to generate a representative set of phase - space trajectories for pairs of specifically initialized reference  ymh fields @xmath98 and their neighboring configurations @xmath99 at sufficiently small distances @xmath100 $ ] and @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "the resulting distance evolution histories will provide one of the foundations for our subsequent analysis of the maximal lyapunov exponents . in the present subsection",

    ", we follow the initialization procedure of ref .",
    "the resulting sample of field - pair trajectories will be considerably larger than that of preceding mle calculations in gauge theories and include results from substantially larger lattice volumes ( with up to 30@xmath102 sites ) .    in order to satisfy gauss law ( [ gss ] ) initially ( and consequently over the whole time evolution )",
    ", we set the non - abelian electric field and the time derivative of the higgs field at the initial time @xmath103 equal to zero , i.e. @xmath104which implies @xmath105 ( cf .",

    "hence the initial kinetic energies of all fields vanish while the potential energies are finite and ensure that the system starts far from equilibrium .",

    "in addition , we will vary the lattice size , specified by the number @xmath125 of sites per dimension , so that each of our field - pair histories can be uniquely labeled by a quadruple of values for @xmath126 and @xmath84 .",
    "our maximal lattice size with @xmath127 is chosen to substantially reduce potential finite - size effects of previous studies bir94,hei97,bir96 on considerably smaller lattices .",
    "the main benefit of the random angle initialization is that it equips the initial configurations with a specific average energy density , or equivalently with a temperature @xmath128 which the fields will reach after equilibration . in our context , this is important because the temperature dependence of the mles is used to relate them to the static plasmon damping rates .",
    "moreover , the resulting mle values will turn out to be ( within errors ) independent of the random part of a given starting configuration , which indicates that the autocorrelation functions of the fields have decayed sufficiently strongly before the mles are measured ( see below ) .    in order to stay safely inside the validity range of the semiclassical approximation , and to be able to relate our findings to perturbative results",

    "( the chaotic relaxation time tends to become even smaller for su@xmath393 gauge fields @xcite ) . as pointed out in ref .",

    "hence weibel - type plasma instabilities _ per se _ seem hardly to affect the mle values , although they could indirectly contribute to our chaotic thermalization if the random initial conditions generate a sufficiently anisotropic momentum distribution of the gauge fields .",
    "it is tempting to speculate , then , that even under rhic  initial conditions the maximally chaotic modes may lead to faster thermalization than plasma instabilities because they generate entropy in a probably more efficient one - step  process .",
    "moreover , the maximal chaotic instabilities select at any time the most unstable direction in phase space and thus remain optimally fast during the _ entire _ ( classical ) thermalization process , whereas the filament instabilities are damped by the gauge field s non - abelian self - interactions .    as mentioned above",
    ", a long - term perspective of our work is to understand the role of chaotic thermalization mechanisms during the classical evolution phases in the aftermath of nuclear collisions .",
    "the focus of the present paper was more limited and preparatory , however , namely to map out _ generic _ chaotic thermalization properties of non - abelian gauge systems in the presence of scalar matter .",
    "( classical higgs fields were included because of their role in the early universe and because they can be treated on the same footing as the gauge fields .",

    ", it would also be interesting to follow the growth rate of  the gauge field s fourier coefficients .",

    "in fact , in reductions of the yang - mills dynamics to a few degrees of freedom , chaotic thermalization was found to start ( under suitable initial conditions ) among the softer modes as well @xcite .",
    "moreover , the  chaotic behavior of the soft modes turns out to be driven by the soft - hard mode coupling , which provides an efficient mechanism for energy transfer from high frequency modes to a low - energy multiparticle final state .",

    "a main goal of our investigation was to explore the impact of the fundamental doublet of scalar matter fields on the chaotic behavior of the gauge dynamics . towards this end , we first confirmed and extended previous evidence for the yang - mills - higgs system to equilibrate over two drastically different time scales : individually , the rather weakly coupled gauge and higgs sectors reach a preequilibrium  phase after only a few lattice time units , whereas their mutual equilibration is substantially delayed by the matter fields and takes far longer than @xmath395 units to complete .",
    "*  * accordingly , we have generated two sets of maximal lyapunov exponents for initially random fields : a larger one extracted from the field separation rates at the preequilibration stage , and a smaller one obtained from long - time trajectories extrapolated to infinite evolution time and thus to full equilibrium .",

    "all lyapunov histories turn out to decrease monotonically with time and saturate relatively slowly even after the energy has attained almost complete equipartition . at larger values of the higgs self - coupling the lyapunov histories vary less strongly during time evolution while their saturation is further delayed .",
    "moreover , the lyapunov histories divided by the average plaquette energy saturate faster than the lyapunov histories themselves .",
    "this foreshadows an early onset of their linear scaling relation in the equilibrated system ( see below ) .",
    "the long - time behavior of the lyapunov histories provides reliable estimates for the finite - time errors of the lyapunov exponents , furthermore , and quantifies in particular how much they are overestimated in the preequilibrium phase .",
    "the physical interest in lyapunov exponents of gauge fields originates partly from evidence for their linear relation to the plasmon damping rates at weak coupling .",
    "this relation relies on the empirically identified linear dependence of the maximal lyapunov exponents on the average magnetic gauge - field energy .",
    "we have therefore systematically scrutinized the accuracy and validity range of this scaling relation on the basis of our full data set .",
    "both during the rather long preequilibrium period , i.e. before gauge and higgs sectors have exchanged substantial amounts of energy , and after full thermalization we have indeed found the lyapunov histories to scale within errors linearly with the average gauge - field energy . more specifically , both during preequilibrium and after complete equilibration our results establish the relation @xmath398 between the maximal lyapunov exponents and the average plaquette energy .",
    "this relation was previously encountered in pure yang - mills theory and seems to be a rather exclusive property of non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "it implies that the lyapunov exponents for any given _ gauge _",
    "field energy , extracted either from the gauge or higgs field separation rates , remain within errors independent of the presence of the higgs field .",
    "this lends additional credence to the suggested equality between the lyapunov exponents and twice the static plasmon damping rates of quantum yang - mills - higgs theory at high temperatures and weak coupling .",
    "in addition , we have established that both during the preequilibrium stage and after full thermalization the maximal lyapunov exponents also scale linearly with the total energy .",
    "this is in contrast to previous expectations and turns out to be a consequence of the proportionality between gauge and total energy during both phases .",
    "we have furthermore studied how interactions with the higgs field affect the savvidy instability of constant non - abelian magnetic fields . as a benchmark",
    ", we have first obtained the maximal lyapunov exponent for an initially constant magnetic field in pure yang - mills theory and found it about twice as large as that of a randomly initialized field under otherwise equal conditions .",
    "we have then computed the analogous lyapunov exponent in yang - mills - higgs theory for initially homogeneous magnetic and higgs fields at the same total energy and found it still to be about 2 times larger than for randomized fields . hence the additional matter fields seem neither to dampen nor to enhance the savvidy instability relative to that of random fields of the same energy .",
    "depending on the initial energy distribution between gauge and higgs fields , however , the presence of matter fields can have a strong impact on the absolute magnitude of the magnetic field s instability . in order to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have provided an example in which the matter fields approximately double the maximal lyapunov exponent of the gauge field .    in all simulations described above , we found the lyapunov histories to be within errors of at most a few percent independent of the underlying distance measure and of whether they were obtained in the gauge or higgs field s phase space .",
    "this independence turns out to hold both during the preequilibration phase and towards full equilibrium , and both for initially homogeneous and random fields .",
    "hence it confirms the general expectation that the divergence rates of the most unstable modes should be equally measurable by any reasonable metric in field space .",
    "the behavior of the lyapunov histories depends somewhat on the stage of the thermalization process , however . before gauge and higgs fields",
    "have exchanged substantial amounts of energy , the divergence rate in the gauge sector turns out to be slightly  larger than in the higgs sector , while it becomes marginally smaller during later phases of equilibration .",
    "a previous estimate of an about 15% smaller logarithmic higgs field  separation rate , based on a single trajectory , was therefore probably contaminated by numerical uncertainties .",
    "our above results strengthen the evidence for the gauge dynamics to provide the main source of chaotic instability in the yang - mills - higgs system .",
    "the matter fields , in contrast , seem to play a subordinate role ( similar to the quark fields shortly after a nuclear collision ) .",
    "the evidence includes the fast preequilibration of the gauge sector , the observation that the higgs sector seems to have little impact on the ratio between the constant magnetic and random field lyapunov exponents , the linear dependence of the maximal lyapunov exponents on the average gauge - field energy alone , the finding that this scaling behavior sets in way before the gauge fields have full access to the energy stored in the higgs sector , and in particular the fact that the values of the maximal lyapunov exponents for a given plaquette energy turn out to be within errors identical to those in pure yang - millstheory .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear higgs dynamics seems not to contribute substantially to the maximally unstable mode , at least not in the range of relatively weak couplings where lattice artefacts are under control .",
    "indeed , at the preequilibration stage the lyapunov histories turn out to be practically independent of the higgs self - coupling , and even afterwards the coupling dependence remains moderate .",
    "nevertheless , we found the scalar  matter fields to have a major impact on the thermalization of the gauge system .",
    "as we have shown , their presence can strongly enhance the absolute divergence rate between neighboring gauge fields , both homogeneous and random .",
    "moreover , the maximally chaotic mode has an almost immediate effect on the higgs sector , as witnessed by the fact that its separation rate can be monitored equally well by following the distance evolution between neighboring higgs fields .",
    "finally , the presence of the higgs fields massively prolongs the equilibration of the system as a whole , at least at weak coupling .",
    "this qualitative effect may be robust enough to prevail in the case of fermionic matter , and hence be relevant for understanding the  equilibration properties of the highly excited quark - gluon matter produced in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions .",
