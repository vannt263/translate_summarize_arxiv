    "the rich open cluster m37 ( ngc 2099 ) in the constellation auriga has been photometrically monitored to search for new variables with different motivations @xcite . the combination of short and deep exposures with similar sky coverage allowed time - series photometry of hundreds to thousands of stars from the brightest to the dimmest within the cluster field ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "their studies indicate that the fraction of variable sources @xmath2 increases as photometric precision of the survey gets better .",
    "@xcite performed the first variability survey for the central ( @xmath3 ) field of the m37 with a @xmath4-filter photometry and found 7 variable stars among 2300 stars ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "due to poor photometric quality , their variables were with large variability and included three w uma - type eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) , two high - amplitude pulsating stars , and two long - period detached eb candidates .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the same data set to search for short - period pulsating variables ( e.g. , @xmath6 scuti- and @xmath7 doradus - type stars ) and rotating variables of later spectral types ( f  k ) , respectively . using @xmath8-band time - series observations",
    ", these two studies found the total of 153 variable stars among 12,000 stars ( @xmath9 ) , including seven previously known variables , in the field of the cluster ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "lastly , the most extensive variability studies in this field were carried out by @xcite as the by - products of a deep survey for transiting planets in the m37 field ( @xmath11 ) with the 6.5 m mmt telescope . the number of known variable stars increased by a factor of @xmath1210 . by applying several statistical algorithms",
    ", they identified 1445 variables among 23,000 stars ( @xmath13 ) , of which 99% were new discoveries @xcite .",
    "this catalog of variable stars provides the largest homogeneous set of stellar rotation periods for a cluster older than 500 myr , which showed the crucial role of the rotation in the stellar angular momentum evolution @xcite .    in this paper , we search new variable phenomena from the same data set of @xcite with vastly improved photometric method ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) . in section 2 , we give a brief description of new light curves and its temporal properties .",
    "we present a comprehensive re - analysis of photometric variability in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we present a new catalog of variable stars and various variability characteristics .",
    "we compare our findings with previous works and discuss the nature of each variability class separately in section 5 .     between two consecutive frames ( top left ) and the exposure times @xmath14 ( top right ) .",
    "we use logarithmic scale for the horizontal axis in these two panels .",
    "the bottom panel is the distribution of exposure times as a function of the modified julian date ( mjd).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we refer the reader to paper i for a detailed description of our photometric reduction and light curve production applied to the archival imaging data of mmt transit survey . here",
    "we provide only a brief summary of the key features . in paper",
    "i , we introduced new methods for robust high - precision photometry from well - sampled images of a non - crowded field with strongly varying psf .",
    "the archival light curves from the original image subtraction procedure exhibit many unusual outliers , and more than 20% of data get rejected by the simple filtering algorithm adopted by early analysis .",
    "we note that some of these outliers are results of intrinsic variability of short time scales . in order to achieve better photometric precisions and also to utilize all available data , the entire imaging database were re - analyzed with our multi - aperture indexing photometry and a set of sophisticated calibration procedures .",
    "this algorithm finds an optimal aperture for each star with a maximum signal - to - noise ratio , and also treat peculiar situations where photometry returns misleading information with more optimal photometric index .",
    "we also applied photometric de - trending algorithm based on a hierarchical clustering method .",
    "our method removes systematic variations that are shared by light curves of nearby stars while true variabilities are preserved .",
    "consequently , our method utilizes nearly 100% of available data and reduce the rms scatter several times smaller than original analysis for brighter stars .    our new data set includes 30,294 objects , including both point and extended sources .",
    "for blended targets , the original image subtraction light curve is still of higher precision than the present aperture photometry light curves , and thus for these objects the archival light curve is used . in order to pick out such cases , we utilized a simple method for quantifying the level of blending ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 for light curve points @xmath17 with uncertainties @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the same statistic measured with respect to a 4th order polynomial fit .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath20 for selecting significant blended light curves , and then count the number of blended ones ( 3746 objects ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the cumulative fraction function of temporal intervals @xmath21 between two consecutive frames and the exposure times @xmath22 .",
    "this observing cadence is sensitive to variability on timescales ranging from tens of seconds ( 30 seconds ) to one month ( @xmath1231.7 days ) . in particular",
    ", the time resolution allows an analysis of the short - term variability , which is less than @xmath1280 seconds over 50% of the data and @xmath12150 seconds over 90% of the data .",
    "variability features can be divided into two broad categories : periodic and non - periodic feature .",
    "the former is easier to detect and model using statistical and model - specific fitting procedures as a form of fourier series ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but the latter is rather ambiguous , since it is not always possible to characterize flux variation and to define a reliable range for some parameters . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", @xcite calculated many basic statistics that can describe the distribution of fluxes even in the limit of few data points .",
    "one interesting approach is to select stochastically varying features in quasar - like sources .",
    "the correlated variability of quasars is well parameterized by a damped random walk model , providing a simple statistical description of their characteristic timescales and amplitudes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we use a modified version of the fast @xmath0 periodogram algorithm ( f@xmath0 ) and the change - point analysis ( cpa ) method for detecting and assessing the significance of periodic and non - periodic signals , respectively .",
    "we first searched a periodic feature by f@xmath0 technique that calculates the minimized @xmath0 as a function of frequency at the desired number of harmonics @xcite . with the best - fit frequency , we compared the ratio between the variance of the data after subtracting the best - fit model and full - amplitude of model function .",
    "this algorithm use a fourier series truncated at harmonic @xmath23 as a model function : @xmath24 the fitting coefficients ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ) obtained in each harmonic model provide a reasonable description of a generic periodic feature , irrespective of the feature shape , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows example light curves of both periodic ( new variable star ; v1983 ) and long - term ( v1092 ) variable stars in our sample , respectively .",
    "because the optimal choice of @xmath23 depends on the true shape of the signal , the fit quality is evaluated for each model with standard @xmath0 statistics , and then checked the residual ( phase - folded ) light curves after the subtraction of the best - fit model . to test the significance of a signal , we use the ratio between the full - amplitude of the model function ( @xmath28 = @xmath29 ) and the rms scatter ( @xmath30 ) of the data after model subtraction : @xmath31 the lower limit for the ratio is empirically set to @xmath32 = 0.95 based on light curve inspections .",
    "@xmath32-values less than 0.95 indicate that we do not expect any significant ( semi- ) periodic signals for a given light curve .",
    "even when the source is poorly described by the harmonic fit , this indicator provides a hint of a generic periodic signal ( see right panel of figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "most variability detection methods require conventional models that are mainly focused on the periodic signals , and are not suitable for the study of arbitrary - shaped , non - periodic , and sporadic variations .",
    "also , in many cases , signal estimation is equated with smoothing of data for de - noising .",
    "this sometimes discards vital information in time series data .",
    "we introduce a non - parametric method to extract all significant features based on the cpa using local statistics .",
    "change - point analysis is a method to identify abrupt variations in sequential data .",
    "it is widely used in the statistics and data mining communities as well as in the field of time domain astronomy ( see e.g. , @xcite and reference therein )",
    ". using a combination of cumulative sum scheme ( cusum ) and bootstrap rank statistics @xcite , we produce a series of estimated change - points which correspond to the moments of apparent systematic changes . for a given dataset \\{@xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 } of size @xmath37 ,",
    "the cusum values are given by @xmath38 for @xmath39 = @xmath40 , where @xmath41 = 0 and the mean value @xmath42 for the sample of @xmath37 values of @xmath43 .",
    "an inflection point at which the sign of the cusum slope changes is used to determine whether a given interval of data should be kept as one ( @xmath44=@xmath45=@xmath35=@xmath46=@xmath42 ) or subdivided into two subintervals ( @xmath44=@xmath35=@xmath47@xmath48@xmath49=@xmath46 ) . based on @xmath50 bootstrap samples that are randomly re - ordered original values , we estimate the confidence level ( c.l . ) to reduce the false positives by random noise . here",
    "are the main procedure of each bootstrap process :    * we generate a bootstrap sample of @xmath37 dataset , denoted \\{@xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath35 , @xmath53 } , by randomly re - ordering the original @xmath37 values without replacement .",
    "* based on the bootstrap dataset , we calculate the bootstrap cusum @xmath54 by using equation ( 4 ) , and then obtain the maximum , minimum , and difference of the bootstrap cusum .",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 * we check whether the bootstrap difference @xmath58 is less than the original difference @xmath59 .",
    "it is straightforward to derive estimates of confidence level as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 typically more than 90% confidence level is suitable for most cases .",
    "when a sudden change is detected , the location of change - point is initially determined as follow : @xmath62 } \\left|s_{t}\\right|,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 denotes the last point before the change occurred .",
    "the time - series data is split into two segments on each side of the change point , and the analysis is repeated for each segment until no more significant change point is detected .    once this set is generated , all the change - point locations and their confidence levels are re - estimated in a backward elimination manner .",
    "using only the sample in the segment bounded by adjacent change - points , we re - calculate these parameters detected by the forward procedure to obtain more accurate estimations .",
    "when any initial change - point fails the criteria in the backward procedure , we eliminate this change - point estimate .",
    "this process repeats until no further improvement is possible . the final change",
    "points thus define the segments ( i.e. , piecewise constant level sets ) , characterized by the start and end time of a given interval with its mean and variance . after this procedure",
    ", signal detection process is performed for each segment separately .      to detect significant outlying features occurring at specific levels in light curve",
    ", we adopt a simple criteria similar to micro - lensing alert system @xcite in the presence of hetero - scedastic measurement errors ( @xmath64 ) :    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    where the mean @xmath69 and deviation @xmath70 are the local statistics for a given segment , @xmath64 is the photometric error at epoch @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the number of consecutive points which satisfy the equations ( 8a8c ) . the different combination of @xmath73 values are used for maximize the detection efficiency of significant outlying features .",
    "the values of @xmath73 were taken to be at least larger than 3 , 1 , and 3 , respectively . as a result",
    ", statistically significant events were flagged as candidate flare sources if at least three contiguous points satisfy the above criteria .",
    "example of flare - like feature detection is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig3 ] . by applying the cpa method to the entire light curves",
    ", we efficiently identified several hundred instances of abrupt brightness changes without any smoothing or interpolation of the raw data .",
    "we use the same limits of cpa thresholds to find eclipsing - like event detection , except the first term of equation ( 8) , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "the cpa method is useful to detect the moments of eclipse ingress , center , or egress in cases where the eclipsing pattern is not repeated or the coverage is not sufficient for the detection through conventional period analysis ( e.g. , box - fitting least - squares method ) .",
    "example of eclipsing - like feature detection is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we will discuss this issue further in section 5.1 .      for periodicity , we first used the vartools light curve analysis program to determine likely periods of variable stars .",
    "this code computes three different periodograms for the light curves;(i ) lomb - scargle ( ls : @xcite ) , ( ii ) analysis of variance ( aov : @xcite ) , and ( iii ) box - fitting least - squares ( bls : @xcite ) algorithms .",
    "because each method is sensitive to different types of periodic variables , it is often useful to combine results from many different analysis of periodicity .",
    "basically we adopt the similar treatment as in @xcite .",
    "we limited the search range of these algorithms to periods between 0.01 and 30 days with relatively fine frequency resolution of less than 0.01/@xmath75 ( @xmath75 is the time - span of the light curve ) .",
    "we also obtained period estimates from the statistical technique sigspec @xcite .",
    "it calculates the spectral significance ( sig ) levels based on the analytical solution for discrete fourier transform amplitude spectrum , including dependencies on frequency and phase . in recent years , this package is mainly used in the study of stellar pulsation ( i.e. , asteroseismology ) , which shows up as small , periodic variations in the brightness of the stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to further crosscheck results of periodicity analysis",
    ", we also performed a multi - step period search algorithm msperiod @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows examples of three selected light curves ; power spectrum and phased diagram corresponding to the highest peak .",
    "the differences in the various algorithms depend strongly on the shape of variation .",
    "one case ( v2256 ) shows that all periods are essentially identical ( @xmath76 0.0784 days ) , while in the other cases the derived period differ a lot .",
    "visual inspections are necessary for v2173 and v1482 to choose the most plausible periods ; @xmath77 and 2.595 respectively .",
    "we provide a catalog of the total 2306 stars that exhibits convincing variations that are induced by flares , pulsations , eclipses , starspots , or in some cases , unknown causes .",
    "this catalog is made available in electronic form at http://stardb.yonsei.ac.kr/. table [ taba1 ] gives the basic information about previously known and new variable stars that we detected in the field of m37 .",
    "the columns are as follows :    : the variable star ids for the first 1483 stars are from the numbering system of @xcite .",
    "new variable i d numbers are given in ascending order by their right ascension from v1484 to v2306 .",

    ", we checked the existence of secondary eclipse when phased at twice the period . in cases where our periodicity analysis is affected by a large scatter of light curves due to photometric bias or source blending , we used periods taken from the previous catalog @xcite , and then denoted by @xmath78 in that column .",
    "we also found evidences of multiperiodicity in some pulsating stars ( see section 5.2 ) .    :",
    "the range of variability for periodic variables was derived from phase diagram in which the shape of the light curve was modeled by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "this amplitude is defined as the full - amplitude of model function ( @xmath79 = @xmath29 ) .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive re - analysis of stellar photometric variability in the field of the open cluster m37 following the application of a new photometry and de - trending method to mmt / megacam image archive . </S>",
    "<S> this new analysis allows a rare opportunity to explore photometric variability over a broad range of time - scales , from minutes to a month . </S>",
    "<S> the intent of this work is to examine the entire sample of over 30,000 objects for periodic , aperiodic , and sporadic behaviors in their light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we show a modified version of the fast @xmath0 periodogram algorithm ( f@xmath0 ) and change - point analysis ( cpa ) as tools for detecting and assessing the significance of periodic and non - periodic variations . </S>",
    "<S> the benefits of our new photometry and analysis methods are evident . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 2306 stars exhibit convincing variations that are induced by flares , pulsations , eclipses , starspots , and unknown causes in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> this represents a 60% increase in the number of variables known in this field . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , 30 of the previously identified variables are found to be false positives resulting from time - dependent systematic effects . </S>",
    "<S> new catalog includes 61 eclipsing binary systems , 92 multiperiodic variable stars , 132 aperiodic variables , and 436 flare stars , as well as several hundreds of rotating variables . </S>",
    "<S> based on extended and improved catalog of variables , we investigate the basic properties ( e.g. , period , amplitude , type ) of all variables . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog can be accessed through the web interface ( http://stardb.yonsei.ac.kr/ ) . </S>"
