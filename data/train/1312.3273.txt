    "the purpose of this article is twofold .",
    "first , we present a method for generating superintegrable systems with a spin - orbital interaction in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 from superintegrable scalar systems in @xmath5 .",
    "the method starts with a hamiltonian of the form    @xmath6    and uses coalgebra symmetry to generate systems of the form    @xmath7    where    @xmath8    and @xmath9 are the pauli matrices    @xmath10    secondly , we use this coalgebra method to derive a maximally superintegrable system with the hamiltonian    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary constants .",
    "this hamiltonian is integrable because it is spherically symmetric and hence the angular momentum    @xmath14    is an integral of the motion .",
    "we shall show below that the system is also superintegrable .",
    "the additional integrals of motion are the components of a vector that is in general a third order polynomial in the momenta ( a third order hermitian operator ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) can be viewed as describing the coulomb interaction of a particle with spin @xmath1 with another of spin @xmath15 .",
    "we recall here that a superintegrable system is one that has more integrals of motion than degrees of freedom .",
    "the best known superintegrable systems are the only two spherically symmetrical ones ( for a particle with spin zero in a scalar potential field , or two particles with spin zero interacting via a potential depending only on the distance between them ) namely the kepler - coulomb system and the isotropic harmonic oscillator @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of scalar superintegrability see @xcite .",
    "superintegrable systems in quantum mechanics are of physical interest for several reasons .",
    "first of all , all maximally superintegrable systems presently known are exactly solvable .",
    "this means that their energy levels can be calculated algebraically and their wave functions are polynomials in the appropriate variables , multiplied by an overall gauge function .",
    "it has been conjectured @xcite that all maximally superintegrable systems are exactly solvable .",
    "the second point of interest is that the energy levels of superintegrable systems are degenerate and indeed this degeneracy is explained by the non abelian algebra of the integrals of motion .",
    "this algebra is in itself interesting . in the simplest cases the integrals of motion form a finite dimensional lie algebra under commutation .",
    "in other cases the lie algebra can be a kac - moody algebra @xcite , or a finitely generated polynomial algebra ( quadratic , cubic or higher)@xcite .",
    "earlier articles on superintegrability for particles with spin concerned fermions in external fields , usually magnetic ones ( @xcite - @xcite ) , schrdinger - pauli equations involving a spin - orbital interaction ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , or relativistic equations for fermions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the connection between coalgebra symmetry and superintegrability was established by ballesteros et al .",
    "( for a review with references to the original articles see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the present authors introduced a method based on coalgebra symmetry to derive higher order superintegrable systems from two dimensional second order ones @xcite , in particular the ttw and pw systems @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the articles @xcite and @xcite were devoted to a systematic search for superintegrable systems of the form ( [ eqi2 ] ) with integrals of motion that are matrix polynomials of order 1 and 2 in the momenta , respectively .",
    "one of the systems obtained in @xcite is of the form ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) however with @xmath16 .",
    "one of the vector integrals of motion found there can be interpreted as a laplace - runge - lenz vector @xmath3 .",
    "it is of second order in the momentum @xmath17 .",
    "together with the total angular momentum @xmath2 these integrals generate an @xmath18 algebra ( for bound states )",
    ". we shall show that ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) is superintegrable for all values of @xmath13 . for @xmath16 or @xmath19 the vector @xmath3",
    ", @xmath4 can be reduced to second order ones , for @xmath20 we have third order integrals @xmath3 , @xmath4 . the algebra generated by @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 is in general a polynomial algebra that in the specific cases @xmath21 turns out to be a lie algebra isomorphic to @xmath18 .",
    "the system ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) for @xmath16 was investigated and solved by nikitin @xcite,@xcite , together with other spin dependent systems with an @xmath18 fock symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we present a series of transformations that preserve superintegrability and introduce a spin - orbit interaction into an originally scalar superintegrable hamiltonian .",
    "the specific example we start with is the two dimensional spinless hydrogen atom , the final result is the spin @xmath1 hamiltonian ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) with arbitrary @xmath13 .",
    "let us start from the quantum coulomb system in @xmath5 in polar coordinates    @xmath22    its symmetry algebra is generated by the angular momentum @xmath23 and the laplace - runge - lenz vector @xmath24 with :    @xmath25    let us use a gauge transformation @xmath26 to transform the superintegrable system ( [ eq1 ] ) ( [ eq2 ] ) into a velocity dependent coulomb system that is also superintegrable , namely    @xmath27    @xmath28    the momentum ( or velocity ) dependent hamiltonian ( [ eq3 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath29    we separate variables in the usual manner putting    @xmath30    and obtain the radial equation    @xmath31    let us introduce the `` radial '' ladder operators    @xmath32    satisfying    @xmath33    the hamiltonian ( [ eq7 ] ) satisfies    @xmath34    and can hence be viewed as being shape invariant .",
    "we shall sometimes replace the eigenvalue @xmath35 by the differential operator @xmath36 ( see [ my ] ) . to do this without introducing negative powers of differential operators we redefine the ladder operators as    @xmath37    these operators satisfy    @xmath38    we also define the ladder operators for the angular momentum , namely    @xmath39    the @xmath5 laplace - runge - lenz vector ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "is now expressed as    @xmath40    finally , the superintegrable system that we are going to apply the co - algebra symmetry to is given by the hamiltonian ( [ eq5 ] ) and the integrals ( [ eq4 ] ) .",

    "let us now return to the realization of @xmath44 ( [ eqsl2 ] ) .",
    "we rewrite the ladder operators @xmath65 , @xmath66 and the hamiltonian @xmath67 in terms of the generators @xmath68 of @xmath44 and its casimir @xmath69 . we shall use the @xmath70 variable realization @xmath71    @xmath72    for @xmath73 this coincides with the formulas of section 2 .",

    "because of the coalgebra symmetry we can state that the system @xmath95 commutes with the casimirs @xmath96 and furthermore with the three components of    @xmath97    equations ( [ cubicrungex ] ) , ( [ cubicrungey ] ) are three dimensional analogs of ( [ quadraticrungex ] ) , ( [ quadraticrungey ] ) , however @xmath98 , @xmath99 are third order differential operators whereas @xmath100 and @xmath101 are second order ones .",

    "they allow us to introduce the following representation of @xmath103    @xmath107    it can be verified by a direct calculation that @xmath108 satisfy    @xmath109 = \\pm \\hbar \\hat{l}^{\\pm}_i\\ ] ]    this leads directly to the representation ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) of @xmath95 .",

    "similarly as in the case of the dirac equation , the calculation of the square root of a casimir operator leads to the introduction of a spin term , in this case the spin - orbital interaction in ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a hamiltonian of the form ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) was obtained in @xcite as part of a systematic search for superintegrable systems with second order integrals of motion .",
    "this lead to ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) with @xmath16 . using the coalgebra symmetry approach we have obtained a more general result .",
    "the price of this generality is that the additional vector integrals of motion are third order operators @xmath115 that reduce to second order ones for @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",

    "let us conclude the analysis of this hamiltonian system by evaluating explicitly its eigenfunctions and its spectrum for bound states .",
    "we construct the wavefunction as a complete set of commutative operators    @xmath127    @xmath128    and the functions @xmath129 are the usual spherical harmonic functions : @xmath130    in view of ( [ spher1 ] ) - ( [ spher2 ] ) we can reduce the 3-dimensional hamiltonian operator @xmath131 to the following radial one :    @xmath132    it is straightforward to get the explicit expression for the bound state eigenfunctions of @xmath133    @xmath134    @xmath135 are laguerre polynomials .",

    "finally we obtain for the bound spectrum    @xmath140",
    "the main physical result of this paper is the new superintegrable system with spin described by the hamiltonian ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) and the polynomial algebra of integrals of motion ( [ symmetryalgebraa])-([symmetryalgebrab ] ) . the corresponding schrdinger pauli equation is solved in section 5 where we give the bound state energies and wave functions .",
    "the radial parts are laguerre polynomials times factors ensuring appropriate behaviour for @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the angular parts are expressed in terms of spherical spinors .",
    "a special case of the hamiltonian ( [ eqa1.4])with @xmath16 was obtained in @xcite as part of a systematic search for superintegrable system of the form ( [ eqi2 ] ) with integrals of motion of degree at most 2 in the momenta @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another special case of ( [ eqa1.4 ] ) with @xmath19 is implicit in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is obtained from the spinless coulomb hamiltonian @xmath143 in @xmath0 by a gauge transformation ( given in @xcite ) that transforms the total angular momentum @xmath144 into a new integral of motion which depends linearly on the total angular momentum @xmath2 and appropriately transforms the laplace - runge - lenz vector .",
    "the power of the coalgebra approach is that it leads to a general independent parameter @xmath13 in the spin orbital potential and that it leads directly to the third order integrals of motion @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "a systematic search for systems with third order integrals would be very difficult .",
    "the explicit form of the integrals @xmath3 , @xmath4 is actually quite simple , however it is not linear in the pauli matrices @xmath145 .",
    "the quadratic terms can be eliminated , but that leads to quite complicated expressions .",
    "for instance we obtain    @xmath146    and @xmath4 is similar . in the past systematic searches for second order superintegrable systems",
    "were conducted for purely scalar potentials @xmath147 in @xmath5 and @xmath0 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and also in more general conformally flat spaces @xcite .",
    "searches for third order supereintegrable systems in @xmath5 , allowing separation of variables were also succesful @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , but were considerably more difficult . for particles with spin a systematic approach to searching for higher order integrable and superintegrable systems",
    "is a prohibitive task .",
    "hence the development of other techniques is imperative , in particular those involving coalgebra symmetry .",
    "further applications and generalizations of the coalgebra techniques are in progress , for instance to obtain suprintegrable systems in @xmath70 dimensions and systems involving higher spins , or two particle with nonzero spin .",
