    "among the many techniques devised to manipulate fluids at microscales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the use of high - frequency acoustic waves appears particularly promising . as a result , the field of what @xcite term acoustic microfluidics is rapidly expanding ; see ref .   for reviews of the experimental and theoretical state of the art in this field .",
    "one of the main ingredients in the techniques developed is streaming  the generation of mean flow by dissipating acoustic waves .",
    "two forms of streaming can be distinguished @xcite : ( i ) interior streaming , induced by wave attenuation in the fluid interior @xcite ; and ( ii ) boundary streaming @xcite which is confined near solid boundaries but influences the interior mean flow by modifying its effective boundary condition ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . both types of streaming share the remarkable property of non - vanishing mean motion in the limit of vanishing viscosity @xcite ;",
    "both contribute to the interior mean flow , although the boundary contribution is small when the acoustic wavelengths are small compared to the flow scales @xcite .    a feature of many experiments in acoustic microfluidics ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the high frequencies employed .",
    "a consequence is that the stokes boundary - layer thickness is very small .",
    "this thickness estimates the size of the near - boundary region where viscous effects dominate and is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fluid s kinematic shear viscosity and @xmath8 is the wave s angular frequency . in water , and for typical frequencies in the range 1 mhz to 1 ghz , @xmath0 is in the range 500 nm to 10 nm .",
    "this implies large stresses at the fluid - solid interface and , as a result , suggests that the no - slip boundary condition that is traditionally used for the study of boundary streaming may not be appropriate @xcite .    motivated by this observation",
    ", we assess the effect that the possible slip of the fluid along the boundary has on boundary streaming .",
    "we do so by revisiting the classical model of boundary streaming over a flat plate , replacing the no - slip boundary condition by the more accurate navier boundary condition @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath3 defines the boundary , @xmath2 is the velocity tangent to the boundary , and @xmath4 is the so - called slip length , a property of the fluid - solid interactions ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the key dimensionless parameter in the problem is the ratio @xmath10 of the slip length to the stokes boundary - layer thickness . with typical values for @xmath4 of 10 to 100 nm",
    "( see e.g.  ref .  ) , this parameter can take a broad range of values .",
    "we examine the streaming induced on a motionless flat boundary by a plane acoustic wave in the far field .",
    "this is a simple problem , which we solve explicitly using a matched asymptotics technique relying on the small parameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the acoustic wavenumber .",
    "the solution is instructive , however , since the effect of slip , @xmath13 , on the streaming velocity is not obvious a priori : on the one hand , the slip reduces the shear and hence the reynolds stress associated with the wave field ; on the other hand , by weakening the constraint at the wall , it can increase the mean flow response to a given wave forcing .",
    "the non - trivial impact of the slip is illustrated by the fact that travelling and standing waves  two particular cases of our more general set - up  have different responses , respectively an increase and a decrease of the streaming velocity outside the boundary layer as @xmath14 increases from zero .",
    "we consider a plane acoustic wave with velocity @xmath15 propagating over a horizontal plate located at @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath16 is an arbitrary complex function , @xmath8 is the ( angular ) frequency and @xmath17 the unit vector in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "note that the form ( [ u1 ] ) includes both travelling waves ( for which @xmath19 ) and standing waves ( for which @xmath16 is real ) .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the compressible navier ",
    "stokes equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the shear and bulk viscosities , supplemented by an equation of state @xmath23 . assuming that @xmath16 is small compared with the sound speed @xmath24",
    ", we introduce the expansions @xmath25 where the subscripts indicate the order in @xmath26 .",
    "we are seeking a perturbative solution of ( [ nseq ] ) with @xmath27 matching the far - field form ( [ u1 ] ) away from the boundary and satisfying the navier boundary condition ( [ navier ] ) at @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the case of a small viscosity , characterised by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the wavenumber ; in this case , the effect of viscosity is confined to a layer of thickness @xmath0 above the boundary .",
    "the solution in this boundary layer is best written in terms of the rescaled coordinate @xmath30 .",
    "this yields the order - one equations in the boundary layer , @xmath31 which indicates that @xmath32 , @xmath33 where we have neglected terms of relative size @xmath34 .",
    "away from the boundary layer , in the outer region , the flow is irrotational and viscous terms are negligible , so @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 satisfy @xmath38 for consistency with ( [ u1 ] ) , @xmath39 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 021 ] ) and ( [ 014 ] ) that @xmath40 is independent of @xmath41 , leading to @xmath42 solving ( [ 004 ] ) with the boundary conditions @xmath43 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 at @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 to leading order in @xmath48 .",
    "the equation of state implies that @xmath49 and , using ( [ 014 ] ) , that @xmath50 is independent of @xmath41 : @xmath51 . subtracting ( [ 005 ] ) from ( [ 021 ] ) , integrating and imposing @xmath52 bounded as @xmath53 then gives @xmath54 also to leading order in @xmath48 .",
    "the two components @xmath55 of the wave velocity in the boundary layer for different values of @xmath14 are displayed in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "we only show the result of travelling wave , and the response to a standing wave is the same up to phase differences .",
    "the figure indicates that the amplitude of the component @xmath56 of the wave velocity parallel to the wall is almost constant as @xmath14 varies while the perpendicular component @xmath52 decreases as @xmath14 increases .",
    "using the form ( [ u1])([v1 ] ) for the wave field , we can calculate the reynolds stress and solve the mean - flow equation which , in the boundary layer , takes the form @xmath57 where the subscripts @xmath58 indicate the limit @xmath59 and the overbars indicate averaging over a wave period .",
    "this expression is obtained by averaging ( [ nseq ] ) , retaining only leading - order terms in @xmath48 , and subtracting from the inner equation its limit as @xmath53 to eliminate the @xmath41-independent pressure term in exactly the same manner as employed for the wave equations .",
    "it is convenient to consider the effect of @xmath60 and @xmath61 separately , taking advantage of the linearity of eq .",
    "( [ 016 ] ) for @xmath62 .",
    "first we calculate the effect of @xmath60 .",
    "a short computation leads to    @xmath63    where @xmath64 denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding term . since @xmath65 , the @xmath41-dependent terms immediately give the contribution to the shear @xmath66 .",
    "integrating these terms and using the averaged navier boundary condition @xmath67 at @xmath46 finally gives the first contribution to the mean velocity    @xmath68    next we calculate the effect of @xmath69 : starting with    @xmath70    integrating twice and applying the boundary conditions @xmath71 as @xmath53 and @xmath72 at @xmath46 yields    @xmath73    combining ( [ 008 ] ) and ( [ 006 ] ) leads to the mean profile @xmath74 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ mean ] for a travelling wave with @xmath75 , and for a standing wave with @xmath76 .",
    "as @xmath14 increases , the amplitude of @xmath62 increases for the travelling wave and decreases for the standing wave ; we comment on the physical mechanism underlying this dependence in sec .",
    "iv .",
    "letting @xmath53 in @xmath62 , we obtain the total steady streaming velocity outside the boundary layer as @xmath77 where @xmath78 this expression provides an effective slip condition for the flow in the interior .",
    "it generalises to the navier condition results obtained by @xcite and @xcite in the no - slip case @xmath79 .",
    "note that @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be thought of as measuring the standing- and travelling - wave components of more general wave fields .",
    "we emphasise that ( [ 019 ] ) gives the eulerian mean flow : results of this type can alternatively be formulated in terms of the lagrangian mean slip velocity , as in ref .",
    "the difference between the two mean velocities is the stokes drift , given outside the boundary layer by @xmath82 leading to the lagrangian mean slip velocity @xmath83 which may be more easily accessible in observations .     and",

    "width=302 ]    from ( [ 019 ] ) we can compute the steady streaming by travelling and standing waves , with @xmath85 and @xmath16 real , respectively , to find @xmath86 these expressions , which provide an interpretation for the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath84 , reduce to well - known expressions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 61 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 94 ) ) , including rayleigh s result for standing waves @xcite , when @xmath79 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath87 and @xmath84 on @xmath14 is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "one ( not necessarily intuitive ) conclusion is that slip at the boundary increases the streaming velocity away from the boundary for travelling waves while it decreases the streaming velocity for standing waves .",
    "more specifically , in the limit of large slip @xmath88 , the streaming velocity for travelling waves is increased by a factor 2 for travelling waves but reduced to zero for standing waves .",
    "correspondingly , the lagrangian mean slip is increased by a factor 4/3 for travelling waves and tends to zero for standing waves .",
    "this paper derives the general expression ( [ 019 ] ) for the streaming velocity induced by acoustic waves over a flat boundary with navier boundary condition .",
    "this expression can be used as an effective boundary condition for the mean flow in the interior when both interior and boundary streaming are important .",
    "naturally , it reduces to well - known results in the no - slip case @xmath79 .    in the opposite limit @xmath89",
    ", the two parameters @xmath87 and @xmath84 that appear in ( [ 019 ] ) and are associated , respectively , with travelling and standing waves , behave very differently , with @xmath90 while @xmath91 .",
    "physically , the travelling wave contribution @xmath87 stems from @xmath92 , the divergence of the @xmath93-component of the flux of @xmath18-momentum , while the standing wave component contribution @xmath84 also stems from @xmath94 , the divergence of the @xmath18-component of this flux .",
    "only @xmath56 appears in @xmath94 ; as @xmath56 becomes unaffected by the wall in the limit @xmath95 , @xmath94 clearly tends to @xmath96 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath92 in the limit of @xmath95 , which involves the @xmath93-components of the wave fields , is more complex . because the outer flow is fixed and the wave velocity is bounded , the wave shear , reynolds stress and hence mean - flow forcing decrease as the slip length increases .",
    "however , for a given mean - flow forcing , the mean velocity at the boundary and indeed across the boundary layer increases as the slip length increases ( because the constraint imposed by the boundary condition weakens ) . the competition between the two effects leads to a balance as @xmath88 .",
    "importantly , this shows the limit @xmath88 to be singular , with the navier condition yielding a different solution to a completely stress - free condition at the wall .",
    "the small but non - zero velocity perpendicular to the wall , @xmath97 , imposed by mass conservation , leads to a non - zero mean momentum flux which in turns affects the mean flow in boundary layer at @xmath98 .",
    "this can be seen directly by combining the navier boundary condition with the mean momentum equation to obtain @xmath99 , neglecting the contribution of @xmath69 which is @xmath100 . in the outer region ,",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath102 as @xmath88 ( see ( [ u1])([v1 ] ) ) ; furthermore , @xmath103 ( since @xmath62 becomes independent of @xmath41 as expected in the stress - free limit ) so that @xmath104 , consistent with ( [ 019 ] ) .",
    "it is only for standing waves , for which @xmath105 and @xmath106 are in phase , that this vanishes .",
    "we conclude with two remarks .",
    "first , different wave frequencies lead to very different mean velocity profiles because of the dependence of the boundary - layer thickness on the frequency .",
    "one can therefore propose that acoustic waves with a rich , variable wave spectrum may provide a method for controlling the mean - velocity profile near a solid boundary .",
    "second , the dependence of the mean velocity on the slip length suggests that acoustic streaming could be used for the ( notoriously difficult ) estimation of the slip lengths of various fluid - solid combinations .",
    "an experiment estimating the lagrangian slip velocity @xmath107 by measuring the mean speed of tracer particles would make it possible to infer @xmath14 from ( [ lagme ] ) and , since @xmath108 , the slip length .",
    "carrying out such an experiment over a range of frequencies would ensure a good accuracy .",
    "the frequencies @xmath8 should be chosen with @xmath14 of order one so that it depends substantially on @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , in water , if @xmath109 nm , @xmath14 varies from @xmath110 to @xmath111 as @xmath8 varies from about @xmath112 to @xmath110 ghz .",
    "one difficulty may be to ensure that the tracer particles provide an accurate estimate of the lagrangian slip velocity : their motion may be affected by interior streaming ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if they are not confined sufficiently close to the wall , and by radiation pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
