    "the theory of derivations of various classes of banach @xmath0-algebras ( e.g. @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7-algebras ) is very well developed ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that every derivation of a @xmath5-algebra is norm continuous and every derivation of a @xmath6-algebra ( in particular , of a @xmath7-algebra ) is inner @xcite .",
    "the development of the theory of noncommutative integration , initiated by i. segal s paper @xcite prompted the introduction of numerous non - trivial @xmath0-algebras of unbounded operators , which , in a certain sense , are close to @xmath6 and @xmath7-algebras .",
    "the main interest here is represented by the @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 ( respectively , @xmath8 ) of all locally measurable ( respectively , measurable ) operators , affiliated with a @xmath7-algebra ( or with a @xmath6-algebra ) @xmath2 and also by the @xmath0-algebra @xmath9 of all @xmath10-measurable operators from @xmath8 , where @xmath10 is a faithful normal semifinite trace on @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the importance of the algebra @xmath1 for the theory of unbounded derivations on von neumann algebras may be seen from the following classical example .",
    "consider the algebra @xmath11 equipped with the semifinite trace given by lebesgue integration and consider ( a partially defined ) derivation @xmath12 on @xmath2 .",
    "a simple argument shows that the algebra @xmath1 , which in this case coincides with the space of all measurable complex functions on @xmath13 is the only natural receptacle of @xmath14 .",
    "similar examples can be produced in much more sophisticated circumstances and clearly indicate that the algebra @xmath1 is the most suitable object for studying unbounded derivations on a given von neumann algebra @xmath2 .",
    "however , the study of derivations in the setting of @xmath1 has been greatly impeded by the fact that it is not a banach algebra ( it is not even a frechet algebra or locally convex algebra when endowed with its natural topology ) .",
    "an additional difficulty ( especially , in comparison with rather well studied algebras @xmath9 ) is represented by the lack of developed analytical techniques in @xmath1 . only recently , in the series of papers @xcite meaningful attempts have been made to study the structure of derivations on such algebras .",
    "of particular interest is the problem of identifying the class of von neumann algebras , for which any derivation of the @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 is inner . in the setting of commutative @xmath7-algebras ( respectively , commutative @xmath6-algebras )",
    "this problem is fully resolved in @xcite ( respectively , in @xcite ) . in the setting of von neumann algebras of type @xmath15 , a thorough treatment of this problem",
    "may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite contain examples of non - inner derivations of the @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 , which are not continuous with respect to the topology @xmath3 of local convergence in measure on @xmath1 .",
    "the latter topology is the only topology considered on algebras @xmath1 to date , it may be also viewed as a noncommutative generalization of the classical topology of convergence in measure on the sets of finite measure in the case when @xmath2 is given by the algebra @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a @xmath18-finite measure space ( in this case the algebra @xmath1 coincides with the algebra of all measurable complex functions on @xmath19 ) .",
    "see details in section 2 below . on the other hand ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that in the special case when @xmath2 is a properly infinite von neumann algebra of type @xmath15 , every derivation of @xmath1 is continuous with respect to the local measure topology @xmath3 . moreover , all such derivations are inner . using a completely different technique , a similar result was also obtained in @xcite under the additional assumption that the predual space @xmath20 to @xmath2 is separable .",
    "it is of interest to observe that an analogue of this result ( that is the continuity of an arbitrary derivation of @xmath21 ) also holds for any von neumann algebra @xmath2 of type @xmath22 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the following problem is formulated ( problem 3 ) : let @xmath2 be a von neumann algebra of type @xmath23 and let @xmath10 be a faithful , normal , semifinite trace on @xmath2 .",
    "is any derivation of a @xmath0-algebra @xmath9 equipped with the ( classical ) measure topology generated by the trace necessarily continuous ? in @xcite this problem is solved affirmatively for a properly infinite algebra @xmath2 . in view of the example we mentioned above , a natural problem ( analogous to problem 3 from @xcite )",
    "is whether any derivation in a @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 is necessarily continuous with respect to the topology @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is a properly infinite von neumann algebra of type @xmath23 .",
    "the main results of this paper provide an affirmative solution to this problem .",
    "in fact , we establish a much stronger result that any derivation @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is any subalgebra in @xmath1 containing the algebra @xmath2 , is necessarily continuous with respect to the topology @xmath3 .",
    "the proof proceeds in two stages .",
    "firstly , we establish the @xmath3-continuity of any derivation @xmath26 for a properly infinite von neumann algebra @xmath2 ( section 3 ) .",
    "then , in section 4 , a special construction of extension of a derivation @xmath27 up to a derivation defined on the whole algebra @xmath1 is given ( here @xmath2 is actually an arbitrary von neumann algebra ) .",
    "we also hope that our approach to unbounded derivations on @xmath2 as well as techniques developed for dealing with locally measurable operators and the topology of local convergence in measure in this paper are of interest in their own right and may be used elsewhere .",
    "we use terminology and notations from von neumann algebra theory @xcite and theory of locally measurable operators from @xcite .",
