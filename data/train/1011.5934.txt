    "this is simply a change of the independent variable in the domain of definition of @xmath20 . here",
    "each @xmath16 may be the identity on @xmath21 , but it need not be .",
    "the latter situation is called slipping along the boundary . the first derivative test @xmath22=0 $ ] , at @xmath23 , yields  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  1.2.4 ) what we call the _ hopf - laplace equation _ @xmath24",
    "we shall investigate the hopf - laplace equation independently of its roots .",
    "nevertheless , because of its affiliation to the dirichlet integral the natural domain of definition , that we shall always assume here , sometimes implicitly , is the sobolev space @xmath25 .",
    "thus the differential expression @xmath26 will represent an integrable function . by weyl s lemma",
    "the equation reduces equivalently to the first order nonlinear pde , @xmath27 we view @xmath28 also as unknown quantity . in this formulation",
    "one can speak of generalized solutions in the sobolev space @xmath29 .",
    "but we shall study , predominantly , the _ orientation preserving mappings _ , meaning that the jacobian determinant is nonnegative almost everywhere @xmath30 within the class of orientation preserving mappings we do not capture generalized solutions .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath31 , thus @xmath20 is ( locally ) a _ qc - deformation _ in the sense of ahlfors  @xcite .",
    "since the complex derivatives @xmath32 and @xmath33 are intertwined by the beurling - ahlfors transform , it follows that @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , for all @xmath35 we have @xmath36 , hence @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "the lipschitz regularity is much harder to handle ; this is the intricate part of our paper .",
    "note that the qc - deformations of ahlfors are not necessarily lipschitz .",
    "returning to the variational approach to the hopf - laplace equation , if one admits slipping along the boundary , then the inner variations of the dirichlet energy should include diffeomorphisms @xmath39{{}_{\\!\\!\\textnormal{onto}\\!\\!}}}{\\mathbb{x}}$ ] that are free on @xmath21 . consequently , supplementary equations on @xmath40 emerge , which are best stated in terms of the _ holomorphic quadratic differential_. @xmath41 it is called the _ hopf differential _ of @xmath20 in recognition of the related work of h.  hopf  @xcite .",
    "stated informally , the additional boundary equations  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  1.2.5 ) say that @xmath42 is real along @xmath21 , see definition  [ realqd ] .",
    "this additional boundary equation will be satisfied by _ minimal deformations _ , see  .",
    "clearly , conformal automorphisms @xmath39{{}_{\\!\\!\\textnormal{onto}\\!\\!}}}{\\mathbb{x}}$ ] do not change the energy .",
    "more generally , any conformal transformation of the domain @xmath43 does not affect the hopf - laplace equation ( [ hopfeq ] ) .",
    "in fact , because of that , it is the shape of the target @xmath44 and its closure , called _ deformed configuration _ , that will really matter in questions to follow .",
    "naturally , complex harmonic functions solve the hopf - laplace equation .",
    "worth noting , is that real - valued solutions in @xmath45 must be harmonic .",
    "if @xmath46 is @xmath47-smooth then the hopf - laplace equation yields @xmath48 thus @xmath49-solutions are harmonic in the region where the jacobian determinant @xmath50 .",
    "there are other situations where the hopf - laplace equation implies harmonicity , see theorem  [ thharm ] .",

    "2 ) , @xcite and in the calculus of variations  ( * ? ? ?",
    "21 ) , @xcite . in mechanics ,",
    "in particular in elasticity theory , the hopf - laplace equation appears under the name of the energy - momentum equations .",
    "let us look at some elementary though critical examples .",
    "one might expect from   that all @xmath51-solutions whose jacobian determinant does not vanish ( almost everywhere ) are harmonic maps .",
    "this , however , is easily seen to be false , for in the complex plane the piece - wise linear mapping @xmath52 is not harmonic .",
    "observe that the jacobian determinant changes sign .",
    "more elaborate examples are provided in section  [ examples : section ] , which reveal that :    [ exnoimp ] for each @xmath53 there exists a generalized solution @xmath54 ( in the unit disk @xmath55 ) to the hopf - laplace equation @xmath56 whose first derivatives belong to the marcinkiewicz weak space @xmath57 but not to @xmath58 .",
    "the message from this example is that without supplementary conditions of a topological nature the hopf - laplace equation will not guarantee any substantial improvement of the regularity of the solutions .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the case of elliptic pdes , like the laplacian .",
    "consequently , we focus on solutions in a suitable closure of homeomorphisms . mathematical models of nonlinear elasticity motivate our calling such solutions _ hopf deformations_.    the obvious question to ask is what topological preconditions do we really need ?",
    "partial answers are given in a few already known regularity results .",
    "hlein  @xcite proved that quasiconformal solutions are harmonic .",
    "this is actually true  @xcite for any homeomorphic solution in the sobolev space @xmath59 .",
    "even more , injectivity is not necessary as long as the solution represents an open discrete map , such are the mappings of integrable distortion  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath60-solutions ( not necessarily injective ) with jacobian @xmath61 are also harmonic . however , in example  [ exsqueeze ] , we give a lipschitz solution with @xmath62 , almost everywhere in the unit disk @xmath55 , which is not @xmath63-smooth .",
    "even more , this solution is a homeomorphism in @xmath64 except for a tiny crack along the radius which is squeezed into a point .",
    "such a failure of injectivity along the cracks ( reminiscent of elastic deformations ) typically occurs when we pass to a weak limit of a minimizing sequence of homeomorphisms . with the loss of injectivity",
    "the extremal mappings will not be harmonic .",
    "the examples , like the one mentioned above , demonstrate that the solutions can be lipschitz at best .",
    "our main results can be described as follows    * lipschitz regularity ( theorem  [ mainth ] ) : any hopf deformation is locally lipschitz .",
    "* partial harmonicity ( theorem  [ thharm ] ) : any hopf deformation @xmath20 restricts to a harmonic diffeomorphism of @xmath65 onto @xmath3 . * improved regularity ( theorem  [ smooth ] ) : if @xmath3 is a polygon - type domain , then any @xmath66-smooth minimal deformation is a harmonic diffeomorphism .    in a summary , we confirm the following principle . 0.2 cm _ topologically well behaved solutions to the hopf - laplace equation enjoy lipschitz regularity . _",
    "0.2 cm    our lipschitz regularity results apply to the minimal deformations ; that is , to minimizers of the dirichlet energy in the class of suitably generalized homeomorphisms .",
    "an explicit example of a nonharmonic minimal deformations is the following  @xcite :    [ exhammering ] consider two annuli @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the map @xmath71 takes @xmath72 into @xmath73 .",
    "it satisfies the hopf - laplace equation @xmath74 the quadratic differential @xmath75 is real and positive along the boundary circles .",
    "the regularity theory of energy minimizing mappings has a long history .",
    "the monographs  @xcite provide an overview of the subjects .",
    "note that in  @xcite the solutions of the hopf - laplace equation are called _ weakly noether harmonic maps_. numerous recent studies concern the lipschitz continuity of energy minimizers in the setting of metric spaces , where higher degrees of smoothness are not available  @xcite .",
    "however , in these studies minimization is performed among all mappings that are either prescribed on the boundary or belong to a given homotopy class .",
    "this minimization problem allows one to use the _ first variation_. our approach is different in that we obtain the lipschitz continuity using only the inner variation .",
    "thus we have in our disposal only the hopf - laplace equation instead of the laplacian .    before rigorous statements we need to review some notation and basic definitions .",
    "we shall be concerned with mappings @xmath76 between bounded planar domains of finite connectivity @xmath77 thus each boundary @xmath78 and @xmath79 consists of @xmath80 disjoint continua .",
    "we reserve the notation , @xmath81      every homeomorphism @xmath82{{}_{\\!\\!\\textnormal{onto}\\!\\!}}}{\\mathbb{y}}$ ] gives rise to a one - to - one correspondence between boundary components of @xmath2 and boundary components of @xmath3 .",
    "it will involve no loss of generality in assuming ( by re - arranging the indices , if necessary ) that the correspondence is : @xmath83 this simply means that @xmath84 as @xmath85 .",
    "the above definition of the boundary correspondence is also pertinent to more general maps @xmath86{{}_{\\!\\!\\textnormal{onto}\\!\\!}}}{\\mathbb{y}}$ ] , specifically to those which are proper and monotone in the sense defined below .",
