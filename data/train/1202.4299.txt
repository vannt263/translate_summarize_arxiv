    "the fairly reasonable agreement between hera data @xcite-@xcite and the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) approximation of perturbative qcd has been observed for @xmath2 gev@xmath3 ( see reviews in @xcite and references therein ) and , thus , perturbative qcd can describe the evolution of @xmath0 and its derivatives down to very low @xmath4 values .    the standard program to study the @xmath1 behaviour of quarks and gluons is carried out comparing the experimental data with the numerical solution of the dglap equations @xcite by fitting the qcd energy scale @xmath5 and the parameters of the @xmath1-profile of partons at some initial @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , to investigate exclusively the small-@xmath1 region , there is the alternative of doing the simpler analysis by using some of the existing analytical solutions of dglap in the small-@xmath1 limit @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the hera small-@xmath1 data can be well interpreted in terms of the so - called doubled asymptotic scaling ( das ) phenomenon related to the asymptotic behaviour of the dglap evolution discovered many years ago @xcite .",
    "the study of @xcite was extended in @xcite-@xcite to include the finite parts of anomalous dimensions ( ads ) of wilson operators and wilson coefficients .",
    "this has led to predictions @xcite of the small-@xmath1 asymptotic form of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the framework of the dglap dynamics , which were obtained starting at some @xmath7 with the flat function @xmath8 where @xmath9 are pdfs multiplied by @xmath1 and @xmath10 are unknown parameters to be determined from the data .",
    "we refer to the approach of @xcite-@xcite as _ generalized _ das approximation . in this approach the flat initial conditions , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , determine the basic role of the ad singular parts as in the standard das case , while the contribution from ad finite parts and from wilson coefficients can be considered as corrections which are , however , important for better agreement with experimental data . the use of the flat initial condition , given in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , is supported by the actual experimental situation : low-@xmath4 data @xcite are well described for @xmath11 gev@xmath3 by regge theory with pomeron intercept @xmath12 , closed to the adopted ( @xmath13 ) one .",
    "the small rise of hera data @xcite at low @xmath4 can be explained , for example , by contributions of higher twist operators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a good agreement @xcite between the predictions of the generalized das approach @xcite and the hera experimental data @xcite ( see fig . 1 below ) for the structure function ( sf ) @xmath0 .",
    "we also compare the result of the slope @xmath14 calculation with the h1 and zeus data @xcite .",
    "looking at the h1 data @xcite points shown in fig . 2 one can conclude that @xmath15 is independent on @xmath1 within the experimental uncertainties for fixed @xmath4 in the range @xmath16 .",
    "the rise of @xmath15 linearly with @xmath17 could be treated in strong nonperturbative way ( see @xcite and references therein ) , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the analysis @xcite , however , demonstrated that this rise can be explained naturally in the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "the zeus and h1 collaborations have also presented @xcite the preliminary data for @xmath15 at quite low values of @xmath4 .",
    "the zeus value for @xmath15 is consistent with a constant @xmath19 at @xmath20 gev@xmath3 , as it is expected under the assumption of single soft pomeron exchange within the framework of regge phenomenology .",
    "it was important to extend the analysis of @xcite to low @xmath4 range with a help of well - known infrared modifications of the strong coupling constant .",
    "we used the `` frozen '' and analytic versions ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "the flat initial condition ( [ 1 ] ) corresponds to the case when pdfs tend to some constant value at @xmath21 and at some initial value @xmath7 .",
    "the main ingredients of the results @xcite , are :      hereafter we use the notation @xmath29 .",
    "the first two coefficients of the qcd @xmath30-function in the @xmath31-scheme are @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 is being the number of active quark flavours .",
    "note here that the perturbative coupling constant @xmath35 is different at the leading - order ( lo ) and nlo approximations .",
    "hereafter we consider for simplicity only the lo approximation , where the variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given by eq .",
    "( [ intro:1 ] ) when @xmath36 .",
    "the sf @xmath0 and pdfs have the following form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the average charge square .",
    "the small-@xmath1 asymptotic results for pdfs @xmath39 are @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the regular part of ad @xmath43 in the limit @xmath44 in the limit @xmath44 by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . ] . here",
    "@xmath47 is the variable in mellin space .",
    "the functions @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are related to the modified bessel function @xmath50 and to the bessel function @xmath51 by : @xmath52      as it has been shown in @xcite , the behaviour of pdfs and @xmath0 given in the bessel - like form by generalized das approach can mimic a power law shape over a limited region of @xmath1 and @xmath4 @xmath53    the effective slopes @xmath54 and @xmath55 have the form : @xmath56 where the symbol @xmath57 marks the approximation obtained in the expansion of the modified bessel functions , when the `` @xmath58 '' component is negligible .",

    "using the results of previous section we have analyzed hera data for @xmath0 @xcite and the slope @xmath62 @xcite at small @xmath1 from the h1 and zeus collaborations . in order to keep the analysis as simple as possible , we fix @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( i.e. , @xmath65 mev ) in agreement with the recent zeus results in @xcite .    as it is possible to see in figs . 1 and 2 , the twist - two approximation is reasonable at @xmath66 gev@xmath3 . at smaller @xmath4",
    ", some modification of the approximation should be considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have added the higher twist corrections . for renormalon model of higher twists , we have found a good agreement with experimental data at essentially lower @xmath4 values : @xmath67 gev@xmath3 ( see figs . 4 and 5 in @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , to improve the agreement at small @xmath4 values , we modified the qcd coupling constant .",
    "we consider two modifications . in one case , which is more phenomenological",
    ", we introduce freezing of the coupling constant by changing its argument @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the @xmath70-meson mass ( see @xcite and references therein ) . thus ,",
    "in the formulae of the section 2 we should do the following replacement : @xmath71    -0.5 cm   dependence of @xmath72 for an average small-@xmath1 value of @xmath73 .",
    "the linear rise of @xmath72 with @xmath17 @xcite is indicated by the straight dashed line . for comparison , also the results obtained in the phenomenological models by kaidalov et al .",
    "@xcite ( dash - dash - dotted line ) and by donnachie and landshoff @xcite ( dot - dot - dashed line ) are shown .",

    ". the experimental points are same as on fig .",
    "the dashed line represents the fit from @xcite .",
    "the solid curves represent the nlo fits with `` frozen '' coupling constant at @xmath74 and @xmath75.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.3 cm    the second possibility incorporates the shirkov ",
    "solovtsov idea @xcite about analyticity of the coupling constant that leads to the additional its power dependence .",
    "then , in the formulae of the previous section the coupling constant @xmath35 should be replaced as follows : ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 at lo and nlo ) @xmath78 where the symbol @xmath79 stands for terms which are zero and negligible at @xmath80 gev @xcite at lo and nlo , respectively .",
    "figure  2 shows the experimental data for @xmath81 at @xmath82 , which represents an average of the @xmath1-values of hera experimental data .",
    "the top dashed line represents the aforementioned linear rise of @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the figs . 1 and 2 demonstrate that the theoretical description of the small-@xmath4 zeus data for @xmath72 by nlo qcd is significantly improved by implementing the `` frozen '' and analytic coupling constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , which in turn lead to very close results ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the fits for @xmath60 in @xcite yielded @xmath87@xmath88  gev@xmath3 .",
    "so , initially we had @xmath89 , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . the replacements of eqs .  ( [ intro:2 ] ) and ( [ an : nlo ] )",
    "modify the value of @xmath90 .",
    "for the `` frozen '' and analytic coupling constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the value of @xmath90 is non - zero and the slopes are quite close to the experimental data at @xmath91  gev@xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath92  gev@xmath3 , there is still some disagreement with the data , which needs additional investigation .    for comparison",
    ", we display in fig .",
    "2 also the results obtained by kaidalov et al .",
    "@xcite and by donnachie and landshoff @xcite adopting phenomenological models based on regge theory .",
    "while they yield an improved description of the experimental data for @xmath93 gev@xmath3 , the agreement generally worsens in the range @xmath77 gev@xmath94 gev@xmath3 .",
    "the results of fits in @xcite have an important property : they are very similar in lo and nlo approximations of perturbation theory .",
    "the similarity is related to the fact that the small-@xmath1 asymptotics of the nlo corrections are usually large and negative ( see , for example , @xmath95-corrections @xcite to bfkl approach @xcite ) .",
    "then , the lo form @xmath96 for some observable and the nlo one @xmath97 with a large value of @xmath98 , are similar because @xmath99 at lo and nlo approximations , where @xmath100 is the @xmath101-boson mass , relates @xmath5 and @xmath102 : @xmath65 mev",
    "( as in zeus paper on @xcite ) corresponds to @xmath103 mev ( see @xcite ) . ] and , thus , @xmath104 at lo is considerably smaller then @xmath104 at nlo for hera @xmath4 values .    in other words , performing some resummation procedure ( such as grunberg s effective - charge method @xcite ) , one can see that the nlo form may be represented as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , from different studies @xcite , it is well known that at small-@xmath1 values the effective argument of the coupling constant is higher then @xmath4 .    in the generalized das approach the small effect of the nlo corrections",
    "can be explained by separated contributions of the singular and regular ad parts .",
    "indeed , the singular parts modify the argument of the bessel functions ( see eq.([intro:1 ] ) ) and the regular parts contribute to the front of bessel functions @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows the @xmath1-dependence of the slope @xmath72 .",
    "one observes good agreement between the experimental data and the generalized das approach for a broad range of small-@xmath1 values .",
    "the absence of a variation with @xmath1 of @xmath72 at small @xmath4 values is related to the small values of the variable @xmath27 there .    from figs . 2 and 6 in @xcite",
    ", one can see that hera experimental data exists at @xmath107 for @xmath108  gev@xmath3 and at @xmath109 for @xmath110  gev@xmath3 .",
    "indeed , the correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath4 in the form @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 lead to a modification of the @xmath4 evolution which starts to resemble @xmath17 , rather than @xmath114 as is standard @xcite .",
    "we have shown the @xmath4-dependence of the sf @xmath0 and the slope @xmath115 at small-@xmath1 values in the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "our twist - two results are in very good agreement with the precise hera data at @xmath2  gev@xmath3 , where the perturbative theory is applicable .",
    "the application of the `` frozen '' and analytic coupling constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 improves the agreement for smaller @xmath4 values , down to @xmath67  gev@xmath3 .    as a next step of investigations ,",
    "we plan to fit the h1@xmath116zeus data @xcite and to extend the generalized das approach to evaluate the double pdfs which are very popular now ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
