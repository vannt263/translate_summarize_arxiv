    "the original formulation of gauge - gravity duality in the form of the so called ads / cft correspondence establishes an equivalence of a four dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory and string theory in a ten dimensional @xmath1 bulk @xcite .",
    "however , the ads / cft correspondence goes beyond pure string theory as it links many other important theoretical and phenomenological issues such as fluid dynamics @xcite , thermal field theories , black hole physics , quark - gluon plasma @xcite , gravity and cosmology . in particular , the ads / cft correspondence proved to be useful in studying some properties of strongly interacting matter @xcite described at the fundamental level by a theory called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , although @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory differs substantially from qcd .    our purpose is to study in terms of the ads / cft correspondence a class of field theories with spontaneously broken symmetry restored at finite temperature .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is related to many phenomena in physics , such as , superfluidity , superconductivity , ferro - magnetism , bose - einstein condensation etc .",
    "one well known example which will be studied here in some detail is the chiral symmetry breaking in strong interactions . at low energies ,",
    "the qcd vacuum is characterized by a non - vanishing expectation value @xcite : @xmath2 ( 235 mev)@xmath3 , the so called chiral condensate .",
    "this quantity describes the density of quark - antiquark pairs found in the qcd vacuum and its non - vanishing value is a manifestation of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the chiral symmetry is restored at finite temperature through a chiral phase transition which is believed to be first or second order depending on the underlying global symmetry @xcite .    in the temperature range below the chiral transition point the thermodynamics of quarks and gluons",
    "may be investigated using the linear sigma model @xcite which serves as an effective model for the low - temperature phase of qcd @xcite .",
    "the original sigma model is formulated as spontaneously broken @xmath4 theory with four real scalar fields which constitute the ( @xmath5,@xmath5 ) representation of the chiral su(2 ) @xmath6 su(2 ) .",
    "hence , the model falls in the o(4 ) universality class owing to the isomorphism between the groups o(4 ) and su(2 ) @xmath6 su(2 ) .",
    "we shall consider here a linear sigma model with spontaneously broken o(@xmath7 ) symmetry , where @xmath8 . according to the goldstone theorem , the spontaneous symmetry breaking yields massless particles called _ goldstone bosons _ the number of which depends on the rank of the remaining unbroken symmetry . in the case of the o(@xmath7 ) group in the symmetry broken phase ,",
    "i.e. , at temperatures below the point of the phase transition , there will be @xmath9 goldstone bosons which we will call the _ pions_. in the symmetry broken phase the pions , in spite of being massless , propagate slower than light owing to finite temperature effects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pion velocity approaches zero at the critical temperature . in the following",
    "we will use the term `` chiral fluid '' to denote a hadronic fluid in the symmetry broken phase consisting predominantly of massless pions . in our previous papers @xcite we have demonstrated that perturbations in the chiral fluid undergoing a radial bjorken expansion propagate in curved geometry described by an effective analog metric of the friedmann robertson walker ( frw ) type with hyperbolic spatial geometry    as an application of the ads / cft duality in terms of d7-brane embeddings @xcite the chiral phase transition can be regarded as a transition from the minkowski to black hole embeddings of the d7-brane in a d3-brane background .",
    "this has been exploited by mateos , myers , and thomson @xcite who find a strong first order phase transition .",
    "similarly , a first order chiral phase transition was found by aharony , sonnenschein , and yankielowitcz @xcite and parnachev and sahakyan @xcite in the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a model of a brane world universe in which the chiral fluid lives on the 3 + 1 dimensional boundary of the ads@xmath10 bulk .",
    "we will combine the linear sigma model with a boost invariant spherically symmetric bjorken type expansion @xcite and use ads / cft techniques to establish a relation between the effective analog geometry on the boundary and the bulk geometry which satisfies the field equations with negative cosmological constant .",
    "the formalism presented here could also be applied to the calculation of two point functions , willson loops , and entanglement entropy for a spherically expanding yang - mills plasma as it was recently done by pedraza @xcite for a linearly expanding @xmath11 supersymmetric yang - mills plasma .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ expanding ] we describe the dynamics of the chiral fluid and the corresponding 3 + 1 dimensional analog geometry . in sec .",
    "[ holographic ] we solve the einstein equations in the bulk using the metric ansatz that respects the spherical boost invariance of the fluid energy - momentum tensor at the boundary .",
    "we demonstrate a relationship of our solution with the d3-brane solution of 10 dimensional supergravity . in sec .",
    "[ pion ] we establish a connection of the bulk geometry with the analog geometry on the boundary and derive the temperature dependence of the pion velocity . in the concluding section , sec .",

    "the coefficient @xmath20 and the pion velocity @xmath21 depend on the local temperature @xmath22 and on the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the model , and may be calculated in perturbation theory . at zero temperature",
    "the medium is absent in which case @xmath25 and @xmath26 is identical to @xmath27 .    if @xmath28 the symmetry will be spontaneously broken . at zero temperature",
    "the @xmath29 fields develop non - vanishing vacuum expectation values such that @xmath30 redefining the fields @xmath31 the fields @xmath32 represent quantum fluctuations around the vacuum expectation values @xmath33 .",
    "it is convenient to choose here @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . at nonzero temperature",
    "the quantity @xmath37 , usually referred to as the condensate , is temperature dependent and vanishes at the point of phase transition . in view of the usual physical meaning of the @xmath38-fields in the chiral su(2 ) @xmath6 su(2 ) sigma model it is customary to denote the @xmath9 dimensional vector @xmath39 by @xmath40 , the field @xmath41 by @xmath42 , and the condensate @xmath43 by @xmath44 . in this way one obtains the effective lagrangian in which the o(@xmath7 ) symmetry",

    "( characterized by @xmath55 ) the effective metric ( [ eq022 ] ) is diagonal with corresponding line element @xmath56 at nonzero temperature , @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be derived from the finite temperature self energy @xmath57 in the limit when the external momentum @xmath58 approaches zero and can be expressed in terms of second derivatives of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 as functions of temperature have been calculated at one loop level by pisarski and tytgat @xcite in the low temperature approximation @xmath61 and by son and stephanov for temperatures close to the chiral transition point @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . whereas the low temperature result ( [ eq3024 ] ) does not depend on @xmath7 , the result near the critical temperature does . in the limit @xmath62 in @xmath63 dimensions",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath64 where the critical exponents @xmath65 and @xmath66 depend on @xmath7 .",
    "for example , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the o(4 ) universality class @xcite . combining these limiting cases with the numerical results at one loop order @xcite , a reasonable fit in the entire range @xmath69",
    "is provided by @xmath70 with this we have @xmath25 at @xmath71 , @xmath72 near @xmath71 as predicted by the one loop low temperature approximation @xcite , and we recover the correct behavior ( [ eq252 ] ) near @xmath73 .",
    "next we assume that the background medium is going through a bjorken type expansion .",
    "a realistic hydrodynamic model of heavy ion collisions involves a transverse expansion superimposed on a longitudinal boost invariant expansion . here",
    "we will consider a radial boost invariant bjorken expansion @xcite in minkowski background spacetime .",
    "a similar model has been previously studied in the context of disoriented chiral condensate @xcite .",
    "our approach is in spirit similar to that of janik and peschanski @xcite who consider a hydrodynamic model based on a longitudinal bjorken expansion and neglect the transverse expansion .",
    "a spherically symmetric bjorken expansion considered here is certainly not the best model for description of high energy heavy ion collisions but is phenomenologically relevant in the context of hadron production in @xmath74 .",
    "the bjorken expansion is defined by a specific choice of the fluid 4-velocity which may be regarded as a coordinate transformation in minkowski spacetime . in radial",
    "coordinates @xmath75 the fluid four - velocity of the radial bjorken expansion is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the radial three - velocity and @xmath78 is the _",
    "proper time_. it is convenient to introduce the so called _ radial rapidity _ variable @xmath79 and parameterize the four - velocity as @xmath80 so that the radial three - velocity is @xmath81 .",
    "now , it is natural to use the spherical rapidity coordinates @xmath82 defined by the following transformation @xmath83 as in these coordinates the velocity components are @xmath84 , the new coordinate frame is comoving . the transformation from @xmath85 to",
    "@xmath86 takes the background minkowski metric into @xmath87 which describes the geometry of the milne cosmological model @xcite  a homogeneous , isotropic , expanding universe with the cosmological scale @xmath88 and negative spatial curvature .",
    "the functional dependence of the fluid temperature @xmath22 on @xmath89 can be derived from energy - momentum conservation .",
    "first , we assume that our fluid is conformal , i.e. , that its energy momentum is traceless @xmath90 .",
    "assuming quite generally that the pressure is not isotropic",
    "@xmath91 the tracelessness implies @xmath92 . on the other hand , the energy momentum conservation @xmath93 yields @xmath94 which implies that the fluid is perfect with energy - momentum tensor @xmath95 furthermore , from the continuity equation @xmath96",
    ", one finds @xmath97 with solution @xmath98 the dimensionless constant @xmath99 may be fixed from the phenomenology of high energy collisions .",
    "for example , with a typical value of @xmath100 gev@xmath101 @xmath102 at @xmath103 fm @xcite we find @xmath104 .",
    "equation ( [ eq006 ] ) implies that the temperature of the expanding chiral fluid is , to a good approximation , proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the expanding hadronic matter is dominated by massless pions , and hence , the pressure of the fluid may be approximated by @xcite @xmath106 this approximation is justified as long as we are not very close to @xmath71 in which case we may neglect the contribution of the condensate with vacuum energy equation of state @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , this approximation is consistent with the conformal fluid assumption which also fails at and near @xmath71 , because the energy momentum tensor of the vacuum is proportional to the metric tensor and hence @xmath108 in the vicinity of @xmath71 . combining ( [ eq106 ] ) with ( [ eq006 ] )",
    "one finds @xmath109 hence , the temperature and proper time are uniquely related .",
    "for example , there is a unique proper time @xmath110 which corresponds to the critical temperature @xmath45 of the chiral phase transition , so that @xmath111 if we adopt the value @xmath104 estimated above and @xmath112 gev @xmath113 @xmath114 @xcite as the critical temperature for @xmath51 , the corresponding proper time will be @xmath115 .",
    "the energy momentum tensor in comoving coordinates takes the form @xmath116 if we relax the conformal fluid condition @xmath117 and add the contribution of the vacuum to the conformal part , the energy momentum tensor will read @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a constant vacuum energy density . then , instead of ( [ eq148 ] ) , we obtain @xmath120 with solution @xmath121 . combining this with the equation of state corresponding to ( [ eq2108 ] )",
    "we obtain precisely the same relation ( [ eq1108 ] ) between the temperature and proper time .    in the comoving",
    "coordinate frame defined by the coordinate transformation ( [ eq147 ] ) the analog metric ( [ eq022 ] ) is diagonal with line element @xmath122 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by ( [ eq051 ] ) and are functions of @xmath89 through ( [ eq1108 ] ) .",
    "hence , this metric represents an frw spacetime with negative spatial curvature .    note that the spacetime described by ( [ eq243 ] ) with ( [ eq252 ] ) has a curvature singularity at @xmath123 .",

    "our curvature conventions are as follows : @xmath129 and @xmath130 , so that einstein s equations are @xmath131    the length scale @xmath132 is the ads curvature radius related to the cosmological constant by @xmath133 .",

    "it is worth emphasizing the difference between the spherically symmetric solution ( [ eq3013 ] ) and the solution of the similar form found in the case of linear boost invariance @xcite .",
    "first , our solution ( [ eq3013 ] ) is _ exact _ and valid at all times .",
    "in contrast , the solution found in @xcite of the form ( [ eq3012 ] ) with @xmath175 is valid only in the asymptotic regime @xmath176 .",
    "a similar late time asymptotic solution was found by sin , nakamura , and kim @xcite for the case of a linear anisotropic expansion described by the kasner metric . in a related recent work fischetti , kastor , and traschen @xcite have constructed solutions that expand spherically and approach the milne universe at late times .",
    "their solution , obtained by making use of a special type of ideal fluid in addition to the negative cosmological constant in the bulk , gives rise to open frw cosmologies at the boundary and on the poincar slices ( which correspond to the z - slices in fefferman graham coordinates ) of a late time asymptotic ads@xmath10 .",
    "another remarkable property of the solution ( [ eq3013 ] ) is that the induced metric on each @xmath177-slice is equivalent to the milne metric .",
    "this may be seen as follows .",
    "the 3 + 1 dimensional metric induced on a @xmath177-slice is , up to a multiplicative constant , given by @xmath178 this line element is of the form ( [ eq243 ] ) and the corresponding 3 + 1 spacetime at a given @xmath177-slice may be regarded as an frw spacetime .",
    "then the coordinate transformation @xmath179 brings the metric ( [ eq3113 ] ) to the milne form ( [ eq218 ] ) .    the solution ( [ eq3013 ] ) is closely related to the d3-brane solution of 10 dimensional supergravity corresponding to a stack of @xmath180 coincident d3-branes . a near - horizon nonextremal d3-brane metric",

    "compared with the existing conventional calculations , a reasonable agreement is achieved generally for those quantities , such as the pion velocity and the critical temperature , that do not substantially depend on the number of scalars @xmath7 . in particular , our prediction at low temperature confirms the expectation @xcite that the deviation of the pion velocity from the velocity of light is proportional to the free energy density .",
    "the agreement is of course not so good for the critical exponents since their values crucially depend on @xmath7 .",
    "the estimate of the critical temperature is close to but somewhat higher then the lattice qcd prediction .",
    "obviously , our results are based on a crude simplification that the hadronic fluid is a perfect conformal fluid undergoing a spherically symmetric radial expansion .",
    "a realistic hadronic fluid is neither perfect nor conformal .",
    "first , a hadronic fluid in general has a non vanishing shear viscosity which is neglected here .",
    "second , our model is based on a scalar field theory with broken symmetry which is only approximately conformal in the vicinity of the critical point where the condensate vanishes and all particles ( mesons and quarks ) become massless .",
    "hence , in this way we could not have obtained more then a rough estimate of the critical temperature and the pion velocity at finite temperature .",
