    "<S> we determine trapping conditions for ultracold polar molecules , where pairs of internal states experience identical trapping potentials . </S>",
    "<S> such conditions could ensure that detrimental effects of inevitable inhomogeneities across an ultracold sample are significantly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate the internal rovibronic and hyperfine quantum states of ultracold fermionic ground - state @xmath0k@xmath1rb polar molecules , when static magnetic , static electric , and trapping laser fields are simultaneously applied . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the effect of changing the relative orientation or polarization of these three fields is of crucial importance for creation of decoherence - free subspaces built from two or more rovibronic states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we evaluate the induced dipole moment of the molecule in the presence of these fields , which will allow control of interactions between molecules in different sites of an optical lattice and study the influence of the interaction anisotropy on the ability to entangle polar molecules . </S>"
