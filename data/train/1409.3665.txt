    "non - locality is one of the intriguing features of nature . as predicted by the quantum theory and confirmed by experiments , outcomes of measurements on subsystems of a bipartite quantum system can be correlated in a non - local way . however , there are restrictions to this non - locality , which raises the question of which non - local correlations are feasible in nature .",
    "the hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics gives some answers to this question .",
    "nevertheless , non - locality is a more fundamental feature of nature compared to postulates of quantum physics .",
    "so the question is whether we can characterize the limit of non - locality of nature based on more fundamental principles .",
    "this question was first raised by popescu and rohrlich in  @xcite where _ no - signaling _ ,",
    "i.e. , the impossibility of instantaneous communication , is proposed as a fundamental physical principle to limit non - locality .",
    "they showed that no - signaling is not strong enough to characterize non - local correlations of quantum physics .",
    "moreover , there are strong evidences against the possibility of realization of such highly non - local correlations in nature  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , other principles were proposed to characterize non - locality , see e.g. ,  @xcite . in this paper , we provide a systematic method for studying  closed sets of correlations , \" introduced as a fundamental concept in  @xcite to characterize non - local correlations in consistent physical theories .",
    "non - local correlations are generated by locally measuring subsystems of a bipartite system ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "imagine that subsystems of a bipartite physical system are held by two parties , say alice and bob .",
    "they can decide to apply a measurement on their subsystems ; these choices of measurement settings by alice and bob are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . letting the measurement outcomes be @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in its full general case , the probability of these outcomes come from some conditional distribution @xmath4 .",
    "we may think of this setting as a _ box _ with two parts .",
    "each part has an input and an output .",
    "alice who holds the first part can choose its input @xmath0 , and receive its output @xmath2 . similarly bob who holds the second part ,",
    "can choose its input @xmath1 , and receive its output @xmath3 .",
    "with this notation , the no - signaling principle states that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "equation @xmath5 for instance implies that when alice s input @xmath0 to the box is specified , the distribution of the outcome @xmath2 does not depend on bob s choice of input @xmath1 .",
    "if subsystems of the bipartite physical system are completely independent , their measurement outcomes are independent of each other . in this case , we must have @xmath7 .",
    "these correlations as well as their convex combinations , which correspond to classically correlated subsystems via hidden variables , are called  _ local_. as a result of bell s theorem and its experimental verifications , correlations that are not local ( non - local correlations ) also exist in nature .",
    "important examples of no - signaling boxes include _ isotropic boxes_. it is a bipartite box with binary inputs and outputs ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) defined by : @xmath9 the box @xmath10 with @xmath11 is local , and with @xmath12 is realizable within quantum mechanics .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath10 for any @xmath13 is no - signaling .",
    "thus a natural question is : what is the largest possible @xmath14 such that @xmath10 is feasible in nature  @xcite .    , and the measurement outcomes by @xmath15 .",
    "then in its full general case , the outcomes @xmath15 , under measurements @xmath16 are obtained with some conditional probability @xmath4 .",
    "we can think of this setting as a box with two parts , where each part has an input and an output .",
    "given inputs @xmath17 the outputs of the box are @xmath15 with probability @xmath4 . , width=288 ]    allcock et al .",
    "propose the concept of  closed sets of correlations \" to study the set of realizable non - local boxes @xcite .",
    "they observe that no matter how non - local the nature is , the set of non - local boxes must be closed under certain local operations , called _ wirings",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the idea of wirings , we describe it in a simple case , involving only two boxes .    having two boxes , each party can choose the input of the second box as a function of the output of the first box",
    "more precisely , denoting the inputs and outputs of the two boxes by subscripts @xmath18 , alice can first choose @xmath19 arbitrarily and use the first box to generate an output @xmath20 .",
    "then she may put @xmath21 , i.e. , she may wire the output of the first box to the input of the second box .",
    "bob can similarly use the output of the first box to determine the input of the second box . with these wirings ,",
    "the parties generate a new box @xmath22 . that is ,",
    "combining two boxes with wirings they generate a new box under local operations .    due to the operational definition of wirings , no matter how non - local the nature is",
    ", the space of physical boxes must be closed under wirings  @xcite . then to characterize non - locality in nature , we may first look for subsets of no - signaling boxes that are closed under wirings .",
    "three examples of such closed sets are the set of local correlations , the set of quantum correlations and the whole set of no - signaling boxes .",
    "other examples of closed sets of no - signaling boxes are described in  @xcite and in  @xcite . however , as noted in  @xcite , characterizing sets of boxes that are closed under wirings is a difficult problem in general .",
    "a source of difficulty is that there is no limit on the number of boxes that the two parties may choose to use , and the number of possible ways to wire these boxes ( defined more precisely later ) grows exponentially in the number of boxes .",
    "therefore , having even a few boxes as our resource , it is a difficult problem to discern whether a target box can be simulated via an appropriate wiring or not .",
    "it is not even known whether this problem is decidable or not  @xcite .    in  @xcite it",
    "is asked whether there exists a continuum of sets of non - local boxes that are closed under wirings . in particular , it is conjectured that :    [ conj1 ] for @xmath23 , two parties can not use common randomness and an arbitrary number of copies of @xmath24 to generate a single copy of @xmath25 with wirings .",
    "although some partial results on the above conjecture have been found  @xcite , no general method for studying wirings is known .",
    "even with the simple structure of isotropic boxes , we do not know how to characterize the _ closure _ of an isotropic box @xmath26 under wirings , i.e. , the set of boxes that can be obtained by wirings of some copies of @xmath26 .    in this paper we present a systematic method for constructing sets of non - local boxes that are closed under wirings .",
    "we introduce an invariant of non - local boxes that is monotone under wirings .",
    "our parameter is in terms of a well - known measure of correlation called _ maximal correlation",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we show that maximal correlation , when appropriately defined for non - local boxes , can not increase under wirings , i.e. , maximal correlation is a monotone under wirings . with this result , we can explicitly construct sets of non - local boxes that are closed under wirings .",
    "moreover , by computing maximal correlation for isotropic boxes , we prove conjecture  [ conj1 ] for the range of parameters @xmath27 .",
    "our result , in particular implies that there is a continuum of sets of no - signaling boxes that are closed under wirings .",
    "thus the sets of correlations in consistent physical theories can not be enumerated .    in the rest of this section",
    "we briefly discuss the main definitions and ideas of the paper , and informally state the main results .",
    "a reader interested only in the statements of the main results , but not their proofs , may continue reading this section and ignore the rest of the paper .      to get an insight into the types of measures of correlation that are useful for studying wirings , consider the similar but simpler problem of simulating a joint distribution from another .",
    "more specifically , suppose that we are given two bipartite probability distributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the question is , given an arbitrary number copies of ( samples from ) @xmath28 can we generate a single copy of ( a sample from ) @xmath29 by only employing local operations on the @xmath30 parts and @xmath31 parts separately ?",
    "this is a hard problem in general since we assume that the number of available copies of the resource distribution @xmath28 is arbitrarily large .",
    "one may attack the above problem by showing that @xmath29 is _ more correlated _ that @xmath28 , so @xmath28 can not be transformed to @xmath29 under local operations .",
    "this strategy depends on the _ measure _ of correlation that we use .",
    "the point is that we are allowed to use an arbitrary number copies of @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , for most measures of correlations ( including mutual information ) , if @xmath28 has some positive correlation , the correlation of @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath28 , goes to infinity as @xmath33 gets larger and larger",
    ". then this strategy fails for usual measures of correlation . however , there is a measure of correlation , called maximal correlation that can be used for this problem . +",

    "the maximal correlation of the box is the maximum of all these numbers . since maximal",
    "correlation of bipartite distributions can be computed efficiently , the maximal correlation of non - local boxes can be computed efficiently too .",
    "our main result in this paper is that maximal correlation of non - local boxes is monotone under wirings .",
    "suppose that the alice and bob share a no - signaling box @xmath4 and have some a priori correlation .",

    "with thse random choices of inputs , they obtain the joint distribution @xmath53 on inputs and outputs of the box .",
    "a simple argument shows that ( see appendix [ mc - wiring2 ] ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is computed with respect to the distribution @xmath52 , and @xmath56 is the maximal correlation of the box .",
    "this means that the maximal correlation between the outputs of the box , is bounded by the maximum of the a priori maximal correlation between alice and bob and the maximal correlation of the box shared between them .",
    "now , assume that alice and bob are provided with @xmath33 boxes @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",

    "that is , after using the @xmath59-th box , alice and bob obtain outputs @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively , and then use box @xmath60 by setting its inputs @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this is a very special way of wiring of boxes and will be generalized later . with this wiring , alice and",

    "this inequality for arbitrary @xmath33 is proved by the same argument and a simple induction .",
    "equation   states that by wiring of no - signaling boxes in the particular way described above , one can not generate a box with a larger value of maximal correlation comparing to those of available boxes .",
    "that is , maximal correlation of boxes is monotone under wirings of no - signaling boxes . +",
    "* wirings of no - signaling boxes .",
    "* so far we assumed that in wirings , each party sets the input of a box to be equal to the output of the previous box .",

    "there are interesting examples of wirings of this type in the literature  @xcite .",
