    "in relativistic fermionic systems at high temperature and/or high density , there are two types of fermionic excitations . besides the ordinary excitation branches of particles and antiparticles , there are additional collective excitations , the so - called plasmino and anti - plasmino @xcite .",
    "these branches have opposite chirality compared to the ordinary excitation branches @xcite .",
    "they coincide with the normal fermionic branches for vanishing momenta . for large momenta",
    ", they approach the lightcone and their spectral strengths vanish exponentially .",
    "the plasmino ( anti - plasmino ) branch has a minimum ( maximum ) for small , non - zero momenta .",
    "these excitations have been extensively investigated for normal - conducting matter @xcite , for a review see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite .    with the exception of heavy - ion collisions , in the laboratory",
    "it is hard to achieve sufficiently large temperatures and densities such that a relativistic description for fermions becomes necessary , even if they are as light as electrons . on the other hand",
    ", there is a plethora of astrophysical situations where fermions have to be treated relativistically .",
    "for instance , the core of compact stellar objects could be sufficiently dense to consist of deconfined quark matter .",
    "the quark fermi energy is then of the order of @xmath0 mev .",
    "thus , at least the light up and down quark flavors have to be considered as relativistic particles , since @xmath1 mev @xmath2 .",
    "however , quark matter in compact stellar objects , if sufficiently cold , is not a normal - conducting system , but a color superconductor @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we therefore investigate whether the plasminos known from normal - conducting systems survive in a superconductor .",
    "this is a question of general interest , independent of the specific nature of the superconductor ( i.e. , ordinary , color , etc . ) . to our knowledge , this problem has not been considered previously , since electrons can to good approximation be considered as non - relativistic in the condensed - matter context , and plasminos are absent if the temperature is smaller than the mass ( at least for zero chemical potential @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible to formulate our expectation regarding the existence of plasminos in superconductors : plasminos are low - momentum excitations which , for large chemical potential @xmath3 , are buried deep down in the fermi sea . on the other hand ,",
    "superconductivity is a fermi - surface phenomenon .",
    "we thus expect that superconductivity should not exert a destructive influence on the presence of the plasmino excitations .",
    "nevertheless , it requires an explicit calculation to prove this , which is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "we shall see that our expectations regarding the existence of plasminos in superconductors are confirmed .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in sec .",

    "in this section the dispersion relation and the spectral density of massless normal - conducting fermions is reviewed in the limit @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we first investigate the case where the interaction between the fermions is mediated by scalar bosons and compute the one - loop fermion self - energy .",
    "we then use the dyson - schwinger equation for the fermion propagator to perform a resummation of the one - loop self - energy to all orders . from the thus obtained quasiparticle propagator",
    "we determine the dispersion relation and the spectral density .",
    "finally , we conclude this section with a discussion of the case where the interaction is mediated by vector bosons .",
    "note that this treatment is not fully self - consistent in the sense that we do not use the result for the resummed quasiparticle propagator to recompute the one - loop self - energy for an iteration of the above procedure .",
    "moreover , we do not solve a dyson - schwinger equation for the scalar boson propagator , which would lead to the generation of a boson mass @xmath15 .",

    "the interaction part of the lagrangian is of yukawa - type , @xmath21 .",

    "this is the reason why the singularities appear with the same signs in the imaginary parts , but with opposite signs in the real parts of the self - energies for particles and antiparticles , cf .",

    "the full inverse fermion propagator is given by @xmath41 where the full inverse propagator for positive / negative - energy solutions is @xmath42 the dispersion relations @xmath43 are given by the roots of the real parts of the inverse propagators , @xmath44 we show the solutions of these equations in fig .",

    "besides these , for low momenta we find two additional roots of both eqs .",

    "the two solutions in the time - like region belong to the plasmino and antiplasmino branches .",
    "for massless particles right(left)-handedness implies positive ( negative ) helicity , while for massless antiparticles right(left)-handedness implies negative ( positive ) helicity .",
    "since plasminos have opposite chirality from particles , the plasmino solution is actually a root of @xmath45 , while the antiplasmino is a root of @xmath46 .",
    "this also holds for the two additional solutions in the space - like region .",
    "however , since the imaginary parts for particles and antiparticles are large in this region , these excitations are strongly damped and do not have appreciable spectral weight , cf .",
    "[ bildspek ] .",
    "the plasmino solutions approach the lightcone and can no longer be found numerically for large momenta .",
    "the size of the momentum region where plasminos are found depends on the value of the coupling constant . for decreasing coupling constant",

    "the spectral density is determined from the relation @xcite @xmath47 if the imaginary part of the self - energy vanishes ( see region iv of fig .  [ energiebereiche ] ) , the spectral density is proportional to a @xmath48-function with support on the quasiparticle mass shell , @xmath49 , @xmath50 which corresponds to an infinite lifetime of the associated quasiparticle .",
    "this is the case for the plasmino branch and that part of the particle excitation branch , that is shown in fig .",

    "this is the case for all other fermionic excitation branches which lie outside region iv of fig .",
    "[ energiebereiche ] .    in fig .",
    "[ bildspek ] we show the spectral density in a contour plot . comparing this figure to fig .",
    "[ bilddisprel1 ] , one can easily distinguish the particle , plasmino , antiplasmino , and antiparticle branches ( from top to bottom ) . as mentioned above , the two solutions in the space - like region do not have sufficiently large spectral weight to appear in the contour plot .",
    "in other words , the width of the spectral density at the respective mass shell is large and , consequently , these excitations are strongly damped .",
    "note also that the spectral weight of the two plasmino branches rapidly decreases for larger momenta .",
    "the self - energy for fermions interacting via vector boson exchange is @xmath52 for massless vector bosons , this is a gauge - dependent expression .",
    "one easily convinces oneself that , in feynman gauge for the gauge boson propagator , @xmath53 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the same result holds also in coulomb gauge .",
    "finally , in the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) and hard - dense - loop ( hdl ) limit @xcite , i.e. , for @xmath54 , the result is gauge - independent , and again we have @xmath53 , provided one takes the htl / hdl limit on both sides of this equation .",
    "therefore , all these cases are covered by the above discussion for scalar boson exchange via rescaling the coupling constant , @xmath55 .",
    "we now turn to the question whether there are plasminos in superconductors .",
    "our rationale is the following .",
    "we take the superconducting ground state as a basis for our calculation . then , the fermion in the loop in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is no longer represented by a free propagator , @xmath56 , but by a quasiparticle propagator appropriate for superconducting systems , @xmath57 .",
    "we compute the one - loop self - energy for quasiparticle excitations in the superconductor .",
    "afterwards , we resum the one - loop self - energy via a dyson - schwinger equation to obtain the propagator for quasiparticles and charge - conjugate quasiparticles",
    ". the poles of the propagator determine the dispersion relation .",
    "finally , we calculate the spectral density .",
    "note that this treatment is not fully self - consistent . as in the normal - conducting case",
    ", we do not use the resummed quasiparticle propagator to obtain a self - consistent result for the one - loop self - energy . moreover",
    ", we do not solve a gap equation for the superconducting gap parameter .",
    "rather , we shall use an exemplary constant value for the gap function of particles , @xmath58 and set the gap function for antiparticles to zero , @xmath59 .",
    "the assumption of a constant gap function is justified only for point - like four - fermion interactions as in e.g.  the nambu  jona - lasinio model . for a boson exchange interaction of non - zero range ,",
    "the gap function does depend on energy and momentum . setting the antiparticle gap to zero",
    "is justified only in weak coupling , because then the contribution of the antiparticle modes to the gap equation is negligible @xcite .",
    "since antiparticle modes live far from the fermi surface , a non - zero value ( of reasonable magnitude ) for the antiparticle gap would only have a negligible influence on our results for the excitation spectrum and spectral density of antiparticles .",
    "finally , we also do not solve a dyson - schwinger equation for the scalar boson propagator which would give rise to a mass @xmath15 .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the complications arising from a fully self - consistent treatment , including the energy - momentum dependence of the gap function and non - vanishing antiparticle gaps , will only lead to quantitative , but not qualitative , changes of our results concerning the existence of plasminos in superconductors .",
    "let us finally note that , in a superconductor , fermions carry a charge with respect to a local ( gauge ) symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by condensation of cooper pairs .",
    "an implicit assumption of our approach is that interactions due to exchange of vector bosons of the gauge interaction are negligible as compared to scalar boson exchange , i.e. , that the one - loop fermion self - energy is dominated by the scalar interaction .",
    "if the fermions do not carry any charge , we are strictly speaking not considering a superconductor but a superfluid .      if fermions interact via scalar boson exchange , and if we only allow for pairing in the even - parity channel , the quasiparticle propagator reads @xcite @xmath60 ( note that our @xmath57 corresponds to @xmath61 in ref .",
