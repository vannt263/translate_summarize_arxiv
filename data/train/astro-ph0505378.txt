    "as with most globular clusters ( gcs ) , ngc 6752 has a very uniform distribution of heavy elements ( see eg .",
    "this implies that there was thorough mixing of stellar ejecta with the ambient gas during the early history of the cluster .",
    "conversely , most gcs show large abundance variations in the light elements ( eg . the c - n , mg - al and o - na anticorrelations , eg .",
    "this indicates an inhomogeneous source of pollutants must have been produced after the well - mixed era .",
    "as heavy elements are primarily produced by massive stars , the evidence suggests that there was a generation of massive stars which polluted the pristine protocluster gas , followed by a later release of lighter elements , presumably from lower mass stars .",
    "in our model we assume a two stage star formation / pollution history , similar to that used in the dynamical evolution study by parmentier et al . @xcite .",
    "the mass distribution used to model the first stars that pollute the primordial gas was based on the work of nakamura & umemura @xcite .",
    "they predict a bimodal initial mass function ( imf ) for a z=0 population .",
    "in addition to being bimodal , it is also top - heavy , favouring massive star formation .",
    "stellar yields were taken as input for the chemical evolution ( ce ) model .",
    "the yields of @xcite were used for the 150 - 270 m@xmath0 range ,  @xcite for the 13 - 80 m@xmath0 range , and karakas ( 2003 , priv .",
    "comm . ) for the intermediate mass stars @xcite ( nb . these were z=0.0001 models but played a negligible role in polluting the early cluster due to the top - heavy imf ) .",
    "star formation occurred in a single burst , with newly synthesised elements returned on timescales prescribed by mass dependent lifetimes @xcite . in this way the cluster gas was brought up to [ fe / h ]",
    "= @xmath1 , the current value ( e.g. @xcite ) , from which the next generation of stars formed .      stage 2 in the model sees a population of stars forming from a mix of the ejecta of the z=0 stars and big bang material .",
    "a standard imf @xcite was adopted for stage 2 .",
    "however , we assumed that the gc only retained the ejecta from stars with mass @xmath2  the winds and ejecta from sne are assumed to have escaped the system due to their high velocities .",
    "thus , only the yields from intermediate mass stars impact upon the chemical evolution from then on . yields from a specifically calculated grid of models were used as self - consistent feedback in the ce model .",
    "they are described below .",
    "a custom - made set of low- and intermediate - mass stars were computed for the second epoch of star formation in the cluster , using the mount stromlo stellar structure code ( eg .",
    "see @xcite ) and the monash university stellar nucleosynthesis code .",
    "this generation of stars has a unique chemical composition given by the first stage of pollution - they lack nitrogen , are @xmath3-enhanced , and are low metallicity .",
    "the models @xcite were computed using the exact ( non - scaled - solar ) composition that resulted from the evolution of the chemical pollution model described above .",
    "this required removing all scaled - solar assumptions from the codes and computing new opacity tables specifically for these stars ( opal tables were used , eg .",
    "@xcite ) . for this ` fiducial ' set of models , reimers mass - loss law @xcite was used on the red giant branch ( rgb ) and vassiliadis & wood s law @xcite on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "nuclear reaction rates were mainly taken from the reaclib data tables @xcite .      to estimate the sensitivity of the gc chemical evolution model to the various prescriptions used in the stellar model calculations",
    ", some experiments were run in which the following were altered : 1 ) the reaction rate compilation used for the nena chain , mgal chain and @xmath4ne + @xmath3 reactions and 2 ) the mass - loss formula used for the agb evolution .",
    "reaction rates and mass - loss are two of the key uncertainties in the stellar models .",
    "nacre rates @xcite were used as the alternative compilation , and the mass loss laws were altered for agb evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ yieldsfig ] caption for details ) .",
    "[ yieldsfig ] shows the results of both tests as compared to the yields from the fiducial set of models .",
    "it was found that altering the mass - loss formula on the agb had a greater impact on the stellar yields than altering the reaction rates .",
    "the effects of these changes are further diluted when used in the ce model .    ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the change due to the use of reimers mass - loss law on the agb ( instead of vw ) .",
    "( observational data references :  @xcite).,width=325 ]    ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the change due to the use of reimers mass - loss law on the agb ( instead of vw ) .",
    "( observational data references :  @xcite).,width=275 ]",
    "fig .  [ naofig ] compares the gcce model results with observational data for the o - na anticorrelation .",
    "the predicted variations in na and o do not match the observations .",
    "the spread in na is easily achieved ( actually too much is produced ) , but the oxygen is not depleted enough . although o is significantly depleted in the 5.0 and 6.5 m@xmath0 stellar models , through hot bottom burning ( hbb ) on the agb , these stars are not very numerous in a standard imf .",
    "using detailed nucleosynthetic yields we have computed the chemical evolution of the intracluster medium in the globular cluster ngc 6752 .",
    "abundance spreads in na and o were found , however too much na was produced , while the o is not sufficiently depleted to account for the observations  the na - o anticorrelation was not matched . altering the imf to favour more massive agb stars may allow the matching of this anticorrelation but may adversely effect the other elements .",
    "thus , although the second generation intermediate - mass agb stars do show the hot hydrogen burning ( via hbb ) that is required to explain the observations , this quantitative study suggests that hbb in agb stars may _ not _ actually be the site .",
    "changing the mass - loss prescriptions and reaction rate compilations in the stellar models does not alter this conclusion .",
