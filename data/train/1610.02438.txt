    "in a series of papers @xcite , l.  ng introduced and studied a new algebraic invariant of a link @xmath0 in @xmath9 represented by a semi - free differential graded ( dg ) algebra @xmath10 .",
    "the structure of this dg algebra ( referred to _",
    "_ as a combinatorial knot dga ) is determined by an element of a braid group @xmath5 representing the link @xmath0 .",
    "the homology of @xmath11 is called the _ knot contact homology _ @xmath12 as it coincides with the legendrian contact homology of the unit conormal bundle @xmath13 of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , it was conjectured in @xcite and recently proved in @xcite that the entire combinatorial knot dga is isomorphic to a geometrically defined dg algebra representing the legendrian contact homology of @xmath14 .",
    "our original motivation was to understand ng s combinatorial proof of the invariance of @xmath15 ( up to stable isomorphism ) under the markov moves .",
    "we should remark that , although the differential of @xmath15 is defined in @xcite by an explicit formula , its combinatorial structure is fairly complicated and its algebraic origin seems mysterious . even the fact that the @xmath8-th homology of @xmath10 is a link invariant is far from being obvious from the definition of @xcite ( _ cf . _",
    "* section  4.3 ) ) . as a result , we have come up with a different , more conceptual algebraic construction that makes the markov invariance of @xmath10 quite transparent and , more importantly , places knot contact homology in one row with other classical invariants , such as knot groups and alexander modules .    to clarify the ideas we begin by recalling a classical theorem of e. artin and j. birman that gives a natural presentation of the link group @xmath16 in terms of a braid representing @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the unit disk in @xmath18 , and let @xmath19 be a set of distinct points in the interior of @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known that the braid group on @xmath6-strands , @xmath21 , can be identified with the mapping class group of @xmath22 , and as such it acts naturally on the fundamental group @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a basepoint in @xmath25 ( which we choose near the boundary of @xmath17 ) .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath23 is a free group @xmath26 of rank @xmath6 based on generators @xmath27 which correspond to small loops in @xmath28 around the points @xmath29 .",
    "explicitly , in terms of these generators , the action of @xmath5 on @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 are the standard generators of @xmath5 .",
    "this action is usually called the _",
    "artin representation _ as it provides a faithful realization of @xmath5 as a subgroup of @xmath34 .",
    "now , the artin - birman theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem  2.2 ) ) asserts that the fundamental group of the complement of the link @xmath35 corresponding to a braid @xmath36 has the presentation @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the action of @xmath39 on @xmath40 via the artin representation .",
    "we abstract this situation in the following way .",
    "let @xmath41 be a category with finite colimits .",
    "we assume that we are given a family of braid group actions @xmath42\\,$ ] , @xmath43 , on objects of @xmath44 having the properties :    1 .   for each @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the @xmath6-fold coproduct of one and the same object @xmath47 of @xmath48 .",
    "2 .   the actions @xmath49 are _ local _ and _ homogeneous _ in the sense that each @xmath50 acts only on the @xmath51-copy of @xmath52 in @xmath53 while keeping the rest fixed , and any two standard generators of @xmath21 act in the same way on the corresponding copies of @xmath54 for all @xmath55 .    such braid actions are determined ( generated ) by a single morphism @xmath56 in the category @xmath44 that we call a _ cocartesian yang - baxter operator _ ( _ cf . _ definition  [ cocartesian_yang_baxter_operators_definition ] ) .",
    "for example , the artin representations are generated by a cocartesian yang - baxter operator in the category of groups given by the formula @xmath57 , @xmath58,@xmath59 .",
    "now , for an arbitrary cocartesian yang - baxter operator @xmath60 , we define a universal construction @xmath61 that associates to each braid @xmath62 the coequalizer of the endomorphisms @xmath63 and @xmath39 of the object @xmath64 , or equivalently , the following pushout in @xmath65 : @xmath66 : = { { \\rm coeq } \\bigl [ \\xymatrix { \\!\\!a^{(n)}\\!\\ ! \\ar@<0.5ex>[r]^{\\beta }    \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r]_{{{\\rm i d } } } & \\!\\!a^{(n)}\\!\\ ! } \\bigr ] } \\ , = \\,{{\\rm colim}}\\,[\\,a^{(n ) } \\xleftarrow{\\,(\\beta,\\ , { { \\rm id}})\\ , } a^{(n ) } \\amalg a^{(n ) } \\xrightarrow{\\,({{\\rm id}},\\ , { { \\rm id}})\\ , } a^{(n ) } \\ , ] \\ .\\ ] ] we call the _ categorical closure of the braid @xmath39 on the object _",

    "in general , we show that , if a cocartesian yang - baxter operator @xmath73 satisfies some natural conditions , which we call the _ reidemeister conditions _ ( see defintion  [ reidemeister_operators_definition ] ) , then the isomorphism class of the categorical closure of any braid with respect to @xmath60 is stable under the markov moves , and hence defines a link invariant ( _ cf . _ theorem [ wada_theorem_trivial_torsion ] and theorem [ wada_theorem_nontrivial_torsion ] ) . apart from the group @xmath74 ,",
    "many classical link invariants arise in this way ( see , for example , theorem  [ alexm ] representing as a categorical braid closure the alexander module ) .",

    "now , the braid group @xmath5 acts on the disk @xmath76 with @xmath6 marked points @xmath88 as a mapping class group , and this naturally induces an action on the category @xmath89 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , under the equivalence @xmath90 , the action of @xmath5 on the category of perverse sheaves corresponds to a _ strict _ action on the category @xmath91 ( _ cf .",

    "* proposition  1.3 ) ) .",

    "] , we will show that the @xmath2-category @xmath109 is a natural extension of the fully noncommutative cord algebra of @xcite in the sense that the latter can be identified with the endomorphism algebra of an object in @xmath109 .",
    "thus , in our algebraic formalism , the link category @xmath109 arises exactly the same way as the link group @xmath110 , provided we take as an input the gelfand - macpherson - vilonen braid action instead of the artin representation .    at this point",
    ", we pause to remark that the notion of a categorical braid closure has already appeared in the literature : explicitly  in the case of groups ( see @xcite ) , and in a somewhat disguised form , in the theory of quandles ( see , for example , @xcite ) . from this last perspective",
    ", our results give a precise interpretation of such geometric knot invariants as a cord algebra in combinatorial terms of racks and quandles ( see remark  [ relation_with_quandles_remark ] below ) .",
    "however , our main observation is that the simple categorical formalism we outlined above admits an interesting generalization to homotopical contexts .",
    "specifically , if the category @xmath48 that we work with has a natural class @xmath111 of weak equivalences ( e.g. , @xmath48 is a quillen model category or a homotopical category in the sense of @xcite ) , then the operation of a categorical braid closure is usually not invariant under weak equivalences , _",
    "i.e. _ it is not well - defined in the homotopy category @xmath112 $ ] . in abstract homotopy theory , there is a standard way to remedy this problem : namely , replace a homotopy non - invariant functor @xmath113 by its derived functor @xmath114 , which gives a universal approximation to @xmath113 on the level of homotopy categories ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  9 ) ) .",

    "i.e. _ the isomorphism class of in the homotopy category @xmath119 , is invariant under the markov moves , and hence defines a link invariant .",
    "this last invariant is more refined than the one given by the usual categorical braid closure in the same way as the homotopy type of a topological space is a more refined invariant than just its fundamental group .",
    "now , let us return to our basic example of the cocartesian yang - baxter operator @xmath104 associated to the gmv action , see . to define the homotopy braid closure with respect to this operator",
    "we will regard the @xmath2-category @xmath120 as an object of the category @xmath121 comprising all ( small ) pointed dg categories .",
    "the category @xmath121 has a natural model structure , in which the weak equivalences are the quasi - equivalences such that @xmath122 is a quasi - isomorphism of @xmath2-complexes for all objects @xmath123 and the induced functor on the @xmath8th homology @xmath124 is an equivalence of categories . ] of dg categories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "its homotopy theory has been extensively studied in recent years with a view towards applications in algebraic geometry and algebraic @xmath125-theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the homotopy braid closure of the gmv action in the model category @xmath121 gives a new link invariant , which is a quasi - equivalence class of dg categories . for a given @xmath36 , formula allows us , in fact , to construct an explicit representative for the corresponding quasi - equivalence class that we call the _ fully noncommutative link dg category _",

    "this observation is part of theorem  [ fully_noncommutative_link_dg_category_main_theorem ] that we state in full generality ( for links with an arbitrary number of components ) but do not prove in this paper .",
    "instead , we sketch a proof of an analogous result  theorem  [ endomorphism_dga_at_1_recovers_knot_dga_theorem ]  that identifies the _ framed _ knot dga ( originally introduced in @xcite ) with the dg endomorphism algebra of a distinguished object in the homotopy braid closure of a modified gmv action",
    ". the modification amounts to collapsing all objects of the gmv @xmath2-category @xmath128 , except for the base object ` @xmath8 ' , to a single object ` @xmath106 ' , while preserving all the generating morphisms @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "we also impose @xmath6 extra relations @xmath131 , one for each @xmath132 , that depend on an invertible central parameter @xmath133 in the ground ring @xmath2 .",

    "our proof is purely algebraic , in contrast to a topological proof given in @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention one interesting application of our algebraic construction that brings us back to topology . given a link @xmath145",

    "this leads to an algebraic description of the category @xmath146 in terms of groups and quivers , similar , in spirit , to the gelfand - macpherson - vilonen description of the category @xmath151 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ yang_baxter_operators_section ] , we define cocartesian yang - baxter operators and the associated categorical braid closure , and give two criteria  the wada condition ( definition [ wada_condition_definition ] ) and the reidemeister condition ( definition [ reidemeister_operators_definition ] )  for the categorical braid closure to be a link invariant ( theorem [ wada_theorem_trivial_torsion ] and theorem [ wada_theorem_nontrivial_torsion ] ) . in section [ section_homotopy_braid_closure ] , we extend the construction of a categorical braid closure to the homotopical setting . the main result in this section is theorem [ invhbc ] . in section [ the_gmv_operator_section ] , we introduce our main example of the cocartesian yang - baxter operator associated to the gmv braid action . in section [ section_knot_dg_cat ]",
