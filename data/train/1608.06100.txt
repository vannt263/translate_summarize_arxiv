    "in the field of geometrically frustrated magnetism , the rare - earth pyrochlores have been studied intensively for the last decades and many exotic states and emergent excitations have been found , such as the dipolar spin ice state and monopole - like excitations in @xmath2ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath3=dy , ho ) , the spin liquid phase in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and the ordered state induced by quantum disorder in er@xmath4o@xmath1 ( @xmath5=ti , sn ) @xcite .",
    "the spin dynamics of these systems also show many interesting behaviors and have not been fully understood .",
    "typical examples are the persistent spin dynamics or the coexistence of the spin dynamics and long - range order far below the transition temperature in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 and yb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 and the anomalously slow paramagnetic spin dynamics in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and yb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite . for the classical dipolar spin ice phase ,",
    "the dynamics were largely suppressed by the approximate ising interactions and the spins tend to freeze at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of quantum spin ice ( qsi ) was introduced where a weaker - ising interaction ( containing additional pronounced transverse terms ) enhances quantum fluctuations which allows coherent propagation of the magnetic monopoles with a linear dispersion similar to photons @xcite .",
    "pyrochlores with pr , nd and yb are proposed to be candidates for quantum spin ice where significant quantum fluctuations can be expected @xcite .",
    "the microscopic mechanism for the quantum dynamics was established based on the effective pseudospin-1/2 model because the interacting rare - earth moments can be described by a crystal field ground state doublet at low temperatures @xcite . for nd pyrochlores , the crystal field ground state of nd@xmath6",
    "was found to be a kramers doublet with strong ising anisotropy ( @xmath7=0 ) @xcite .",
    "huang et .",
    "al .  found that the doublet is a dipolar - octupolar doublet and the symmetry allowed nearest - neighbor exchange interaction takes the form of the xyz model , a non - ising interaction which can enhance the spin - flip process @xcite .",
    "the xyz model for nd pyrochlores supports two distinct qsi phases beside the conventional long - range `` all - in - all - out '' antiferromagnetic order .",
    "even though nd@xmath4o@xmath1 ( @xmath8zr , hf , sn ) pyrochlores were reported recently to exhibit the `` all - in - all - out '' order , strong spin fluctuations can be still expected as suggested by the strongly reduced ordered moment at base temperature @xcite . in addition , the @xmath9 dependence of the low temperature magnetic heat capacity of nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 and the high susceptibility of the ordered phase of nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 also point to the strong fluctuations in the ordered phase @xcite .",
    "very recently , magnetic fragmentation and novel excitations were observed in neutron scattering experiments on a single crystal of nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 evidenced by the coexistence of the bragg peaks from the `` all - in - all - out '' order and the pinch point pattern characteristic for the magnetic coulomb phase @xcite .",
    "it was revealed that the ground state of nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 is possibly a magnetic monopole crystal ( alternating `` 3-in-1-out '' and",
    "`` 1-in-3-out '' spin configurations on the network of tetrahedra ) and the fragmentation of the magnetic field of this moment configuration produces the two experimental features @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to gain some insight into the spin dynamics of this system .",
    "recently , the muon spin relaxation ( @xmath10sr ) technique was used to study the spin dynamics of nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 and persistent spin dynamics were found in the ground state along with the static order indicated by the oscillation of the muon polarization @xcite . here",
    "we study nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 also using the @xmath10sr technique and find that , in contrast to nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 , this compound shows strong quantum fluctuations in the ordered state which wash out the normal @xmath10sr signatures for static order .",
    "anomalously slow spin dynamics in the paramagnetic state are also found .",
    "our results support the proposed theoretical analyses mentioned above .",
    "the same nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 powder sample was used from ref .",
    "@xcite which was synthesized by the conventional solid state reaction method and characterized by synchrotron x - ray diffraction which confirmed a site mixing of less than 0.5  % and no oxygen defect .",
    "the longitudinal muon spin relaxation experiment was performed on the spectrometers ltf ( 20  mk  -  4.2  k ) and gps ( 1.5  -  300  k ) at the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) , switzerland . for a positive muon spin relaxation experiment ,",
    "the fully polarized muons are implanted into the sample and after a short time ( less than @xmath11 ) they thermalize without losing their polarization and stop at interstitial crystallographic sites .",
    "then , the muon spins start to precess around the local magnetic field created by the atomic moments .",
    "when a muon decays ( the life time of the muon is @xmath12 ) , a positron is emitted with its momentum preferentially along the direction of the muon spin .",
    "the number of the emitted positrons is recorded as a function of time by two detectors placed at the forward ( f ) and backward ( b ) positions with respect to the initial muon polarization direction . after counting millions of muons , the time evolution of the muon spin polarization ( or asymmetry )",
    "can be obtained by @xmath13 where @xmath14(t ) and @xmath15(t ) are the number of counts recorded by the backward , forward detectors , respectively and @xmath16 is the relative efficiency factor of the two detectors ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the initial asymmetry and background .    for the experiment on ltf ,",
    "about 2  g nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 powder was mixed with ethanol diluted ge 7031 varnish and attached to a silver plate for a good thermalization .",
    "a dilution refrigerator was used which achieved a base temperature of 20  mk and a maximum temperature 4.2  k. the high temperature spectra ( 1.5  -  300  k ) were recorded on gps with a powder sample of about 2  g wrapped in thin aluminium foil and was cooled by a helium flow crystat .",
    "the data were collected at several temperatures in zero field ( zf ) and in several longitudinal fields ( lf ) ( parallel to the initial muon spin polarization ) up to 0.5  t and the analysis was done by using the free software package musrfit @xcite .",

    "in addition , the 1/3@xmath21 tail is also not shown which is another indicator for a static internal field in a powder sample @xcite .",

    "fits the data better which is a phenomenological model accounting for the homogeneous disorder by including a collection of gaussian field distributions with a gaussian - function - weighed standard deviation @xcite .",
    "there are three parameters in the model : the fluctuation rate @xmath26 , the average standard deviation @xmath27 and the standard deviation @xmath28 of the gaussian - weighted standard deviation of the internal field @xcite .",
    "while for the last one , @xmath29 is usually used instead .",
    "the fitted spectra and parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltfzf ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ltfzf_par ] , respectively .",
    "note that the fitting reproduces most of the features of the spectra but it does not show a clear inflection point and local minimum .",
    "the fitting shows that the fluctuation rate @xmath26 decreases with decreasing temperature continuously and becomes almost temperature independent below the ordering temperature , indicating persistent spin dynamics .",
    "the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath30 characterizing the standard deviation of the field distribution decrease gradually with decreasing temperature and then increase suddenly at the ordering temperature .",
    "there are mainly two reasons for the absence of oscillations in an ordered state : either there is no local field at the muon site , i.e. @xmath31  =  zero or the fluctuations are fast , i.e. @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio )",
    ". the first case can be due to a cancellation of the dipolar field at the muon stopping sites from different ordered moments @xcite .",
    "dipolar field cancellation can happen at high symmetry sites in the unit cell for the current highly - symmetric magnetic structure .",
    "considering the sites of oxygen anions near to which the positively charged muon generally stops in oxides , the crystallographic 8@xmath34 site has a high symmetry .",
    "it is at the centre of the nd@xmath6 tetrahedron where all the four spins at the vertices of the tetrahedron point inwards or outwards . at this site",
    "the local field is exactly zero .",
    "however , a muon normally stops at a distance 0.9  -  1.1    from the oxygen which is not the centre of the tetrahedron @xcite . according to our dipolar field calculation based on the current magnetic structure ,",
    "there is almost no place surrounding the oxygen ions at the 8@xmath34 and 48@xmath35 sites that has zero field @xcite .",
    "in addition , the related compounds nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 and nd@xmath0hf@xmath0o@xmath1 which have the same ordered structure show oscillations or missing asymmetry ( fast oscillations that are not resolved by the instrument ) , which indicates that there are non - zero static ( relative to @xmath36 ) fields at the muon stopping sites in these two compounds @xcite . for nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 , it is reasonable to assume that muons stop at similar positions as in nd@xmath4o@xmath1 ( @xmath8  sn , hf ) where a non - zero local field should also be present .",
    "moreover , because nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 and nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 show similar magnitude of ordered moment @xcite , a similar oscillation frequency would be expected .",
    "while nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 shows clear oscillation signal below 0.65  @xmath22 , nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 does not show any sign of oscillation even at the temperature 0.05  @xmath22 , which indicates much stronger dynamics in nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "it should be mentioned that a very broad distribution of static field ( compared with the average value of the field ) can also wash out the oscillation signal .",
    "however , the @xmath10sr spectra for nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 indicate that the local field at the muon stopping site can be 127  mt @xcite and if we assume that nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 has a similar static order to nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 , a similar local field can be expected which is at least an order of magnitude larger than the field distribution width obtained here .",
    "the measurement with longitudinal field in sec.[lf ] also excluded this possibility .",
    "therefore , the absence of the oscillations is attributed to the strong spin fluctuations in the ordered state which is unusual for a system with strong ising anisotropic moments .",
    "this result supports the existence of a significant transverse coupling between the ising spins possibly induced by the multipole - multipole interactions .",
    "nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 seems quite different from its counterpart compound nd@xmath4o@xmath1 ( @xmath8  sn , hf ) as mentioned above , which is not so surprising in the context that sibling pyrochlore compounds could show quite different properties , e.g. yb and tb titanates and stannates . according to the microscopic calculation of the psuedo spin exchange interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite , the strength ratio of the transverse coupling to the ising one is strongly dependent on composition of crystal field ground state wave function and thus dependent on the @xmath5 ions and the crystal field parameters .         for temperatures 20  mk , 300  mk and 500  mk .",
    "the zf parameters are also shown which are extracted from the fitting with the dynamical gbgkt function .",
    "the red lines are a guide to the eye.,width=240 ]    the obtained spin fluctuation rate is in the range of megahertz and is compatible with the magnetic structure which has a time scale of larger than @xmath3710@xmath38  s as estimated from the energy resolution of the neutron diffractometer @xcite .",
    "an ordered phase without a spontaneous muon spin precession was also reported for tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "@xcite and yb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite . however nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 is a special case because it is a strong ising system with additional multipole interactions that introduces the dynamics while for the others a planar component of the spin or low - energy crystal field excitations play vital roles @xcite . in addition , it is very interesting that the obtained fluctuation rate and field distribution width in the ordered and paramagnetic states are comparable with the quantum spin ice materials yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( where magnetic order was found recently ) and yb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 but are much lower than those of the dynamical spin ice tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is striking that the spectra in the paramagnetic state are also described by the model at the quasi - static limit rather than the simple exponential or the stretched exponential function which is generally the motion - narrowing limit of the model .",
    "this points to anomalously slow paramagnetic spin dynamics which can be associated with the strong spin correlations or short - range order as was also reported for the sibling compound nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 and the quantum spin ice materials yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , yb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the magnetic heat capacity which develops at around 10  k @xcite .",
    "the slow paramagnetic spin dynamics unexpectedly persists in the ordered state resulting in the absence of the oscillations in the ordered state .",
    "recently , a muon induced effect is reported for pr@xmath4o@xmath1 ( @xmath8  zr , hf , sn ) which makes the system order because the implanted muon stopping around the 48@xmath35 site oxygen modifies the local environment anisotropically of the non - kramers rare earth ion pr@xmath6 and lifts the degeneracy of the crystal field ground state doublet @xcite .",
    "this is not expected for the kramers ion like nd@xmath6 whose kramers degeneracy is protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the strong fluctuations of the ordered state are also confirmed by measurements in a longitudinal field which is usually used to find out whether the damping of the muon polarization is caused by dephasing due to the distribution of static field or relaxation due to field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry spectra measured in several fields at 20  mk are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltf20d ] .",
    "the spectra show clear field - induced oscillations which evolve gradually with increasing field but no sign of relaxation quenching can be seen , which confirms the dynamical properties of the system .",

    "[ fig : ltf_ddelta ] . as",
    "the applied field increases , the fluctuation rate @xmath26 increases and shows a maximum around 80  mt , which is not a simple field quenching effect .",
    "we tentatively ascribe this peak in the fluctuation rate to the field - induced metamagnetic transition from the antiferromagnetic spin configuration to a ferromagnetic one as observed in the single crystal magnetization measurement ( the transition fields for the three main cubic directions are around 100  mt at 90  mk ) @xcite .",
    "the same model also fits the data at 300  mk ( below @xmath22 ) and 500  mk ( above @xmath22 ) as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : ltf_ddelta ] . a similar field induced peak in the fluctuation rate for 300  mk is also observed but at a lower field , similar to the magnetization data which shows a decreased metamagnetic transition field at a higher temperature @xcite .",
    "however , at 500  mk in the paramagnetic state , the peak is still present , which might be due to the break down of the short - range antiferromagnetic correlations induced by the field ( discussed more in the next section ) .",
    "in addition , the fitted internal field @xmath42 and field standard deviation @xmath40 increase with increasing the external field almost linearly ( fig .",

    "[ fig : ltfzf_par ] ) . at the same time , the exponent @xmath48 increases and is larger than one below 2  k showing the evolution of the spectra , which further indicates the slowing down of the system .",
    "the increase in the relaxation rate or the slowing down of the spin fluctuations below 20  k is due to the approach to the magnetic ordering as observed in the specific heat measurement @xcite .",
    "this increase of @xmath47 is largely suppressed by the 50  mt longitudinal field , as was also found in nd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , which maybe caused by the competition between the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and zeeman interaction ( explained below ) .",
    "the inflection point of @xmath47 at @xmath3780  k could be induced by orbach process : here the magnetic moment of nd@xmath6 relaxes through a real two phonon process with an excited crystal - field state as a intermediate state .",

    "<S> we present a muon spin relaxation study on the ising pyrochlore nd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 which develops an `` all - in - all - out '' magnetic order below 0.4  k. at 20  mk far below the ordering transition temperature , the zero - field muon spin relaxation spectra show no static features and can be well described by a dynamical gaussian - broadened gaussian kubo - toyabe function indicating strong fluctuations of the ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of the paramagnetic state ( below 4.2  k ) reveal anomalously slow paramagnetic spin dynamics and show only small difference with the spectra of the ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fluctuation rate decreases with decreasing temperature and becomes nearly temperature independent below the transition temperature indicating persistent slow spin dynamics in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the field distribution width shows a small but sudden increase at the transition temperature and then becomes almost constant . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra in applied longitudinal fields are well fitted by the conventional dynamical gaussian kubo - toyabe function , which further supports the dynamical nature of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation rate shows a peak as a function of external field which is associated with a field - induced spin - flip transition . </S>",
    "<S> the strong dynamics in the ordered state are attributed to the transverse coupling of the ising spins introduced by the multipole interactions . </S>"
