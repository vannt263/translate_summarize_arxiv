    "the problem of growing trees belongs to larger class of problems of evolving networks  a new area with many interdisciplinary applications , from biology and computational science to linguistics @xcite . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "we often investigate the state of thermodynamic equilibrium , which is unique and therefore it can not preserve any information .",
    "however , in other sciences memory on past states is an essential ingredient of the system .",
    "here we are interested in search how the structure of the origin of a tree , i.e. of a graph from which the tree is constructed , influences the overall characteristics of the growing system .",
    "a network containing @xmath0 nodes is fully characterized by its connectivity matrix @xmath1 : @xmath2 if the nodes @xmath3 are linked together , and @xmath4 elsewhere .",
    "more convenient but somewhat redundant is the distance matrix @xmath5 , where the matrix element @xmath6 is the number of links along the shortest path from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "it is often simpler to describe a network statistically .",
    "a local characteristics of a network includes the degree distribution , i.e. the probability that a node is linked to a given number @xmath9 of neighbors .",
    "a global characteristics includes the node - node distance distribution .",
    "whereas the former can be treated as complete only conditionally @xcite , a few is known on the latter .",
    "recent progress of knowledge on the mean node - node distance @xmath10 $ ] is due to applications of equilibrium statistical mechanics , scaling hypotheses and/or assumptions of lack of correlations between nodes @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath11 denotes an average over @xmath12 non - diagonal matrix elements and @xmath13 $ ] is an average over different matrices , i.e. different graphs .    by growing we mean adding subsequent nodes to an already existing graph . when each node is added with one link only @xmath14 , a tree  a compact graph without loops and without multiple edges",
    " is formed . in trees ,",
    "a path between each two nodes is unique , and it can not be changed during the growth process . when a node is added , the node - node distance matrix @xmath5 is increased by one column and one row . once the matrix elements are formed , they do not change their values . however , if nodes are added with two or more links @xmath15 , a kind of shortcuts are formed and some node - node distances may be shortened .    the main goal of this work is to demonstrate , that the node - node distance distribution of a growing tree preserves an information on the structure of the initial tree , from which it is formed .    below we deal with two kinds of growing trees , which differ in the degree distribution .",
    "let us consider the linking of new nodes to randomly selected nodes .",
    "when the selection is made without any preference , we obtain a so - called exponential tree . in this case , the degree distribution @xmath16 , where @xmath9 is the number of links of a node .",
    "nodes can be selected also with some preference with respect to their degree .",
    "if the linking probability is proportional to the degree @xmath9 , we obtain the scale - free or barabsi  albert networks @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath17 , with @xmath18 @xcite .    to achieve our goal ,",
    "the simplest method is to calculate the mean node - node distance @xmath19 for trees of @xmath0 nodes , the formation of which has started from two different trees with four nodes .",
    "this is done in the next section with iterative equations , which has been derived recently for the exponential trees @xcite . in section [ sec_algorithm ] , the growth algorithms are introduced , basing on an evolution of the distance matrix . in section [ sec_results ] ,",
    "numerical results are presented for the exponential trees and the barabsi  albert scale - free trees .",
    "we show also that the memory on the ancestral network is much reduced , if the trees are substituted by graphs with cyclic paths , i.e. with @xmath20 . the last section is devoted to discussion .",
    "consider the probability that a tree of a given structure is grown .",
    "trees are different if there is no one - to - one correspondence between their pairs of linked nodes @xcite .",
    "let us denote the number of different trees with @xmath0 nodes by @xmath21 .",
    "it is easy to check by inspection , that @xmath22 and @xmath23 . as @xmath24 , the probability  or weight  of the tree of three nodes ( fig . [",
    "fig_trees](a ) ) must be one .",
    "an exponential tree of four nodes can be formed by linking a new ( fourth ) node either to one of two end nodes , or to the central one .",
    "then , the probability of a chain of nodes ( fig . [ fig_trees](b ) ) is @xmath25 , and the probability of a star - like - tree ( fig . [ fig_trees](c ) ) is @xmath26 . from the chain , a longer chain ( fig . [ fig_trees](d ) ) can be produced in two ways , then its weight is @xmath27 . from the star , another star ( fig .",
    "[ fig_trees](f ) ) can appear with the probability @xmath28 .",
    "the remaining tree ( fig . [ fig_trees](e ) ) can be formed from either the chain or the star , then its weight is @xmath29 .",
    "we note that in the case of the scale - free trees , the weights of the trees presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_trees ] are : 1 , 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/6 , 7/12 and 1/4 , respectively .",
    "this is a simple demonstration , that the weights of trees in two different classes are different .",
    "any possible tree can be formed from a tree of three nodes ( fig . [ fig_trees](a ) ) .",
    "the way to form chains and stars is unique and then , their weights are relatively small .",
    "example giving , the weight of an exponential star of @xmath0 nodes is .",
    "we could eliminate stars , if we develop trees from the chain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_trees](b ) .",
    "seemingly , the weights of other trees should not be changed much , but all of them are influenced by the lack of the stars .",
    "example giving , in this case the tree shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_trees](e ) can be formed in one unique way . as a consequence , the whole distribution of weights is rebuilt . with the iterative equations derived recently @xcite",
    ", we can calculate the mean distance @xmath30 and the mean square of distances @xmath31 $ ] for two `` families '' of trees .",
    "one is formed from the chain - like tree shown in fig . [ fig_trees](b ) and labeled as `` z '' , and another  from the star - like tree presented in fig . [ fig_trees](c ) and marked as `` y '' .",
    "then , the first `` family '' does not contain stars , and the second one does not contain chains .",
    "the equations are :    [ eq_iter ] @xmath32 and @xmath33    the information on the initial trees is encoded in the initial values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to check , that for the chain @xmath36 , @xmath37 and for the star @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "similar method has been used in @xcite .",
    "the difference is that here , the eqs .",
    "are exact , but they apply only to the exponential trees .",
    "two initial trees with four nodes ( the chain and the star ) are represented in the computer memory as two distance matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the starting point are two matrices for two trees of four nodes : @xmath42 for the chain and the star , respectively .    selecting a node",
    "to link a new node is equivalent to select a number @xmath43 of column / row of the matrix .",
    "then the matrix is supplemented by new column and row , which are copies of the @xmath43-th column / row but with all elements incremented by one    @xmath44    and obviously @xmath45    the eq",
    ". served in the derivation of the iterative formulas @xcite .",
    "the same numerical technique is applied also to the case of the barabsi  albert scale - free trees .",
    "the only difference is that in this case , the node @xmath43 is selected with preference of the number of its pre - existing links .",
    "namely , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number @xmath9 of links of @xmath7-th node .",
    "additional matrix @xmath48 contains the indices of row of the distance matrix @xmath5 where `` 1 '' is encountered .",
    "each case @xmath49 indicates a link between nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the matrix @xmath48 is useful to select nodes of given degree for the scale - free trees and graphs , according to the so - called kertsz algorithm @xcite .",
    "further , the same technique is applied to simple graphs , where new nodes are attached to previously existing ones by @xmath50 links .",
    "then , cyclic paths are possible and the distance matrix @xmath5 is to be rebuilt when adding each node .",
    "the algorithm is as follows : let us suppose that @xmath51-th node is added to existing nodes @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "then    [ eq_graphs ] @xmath54 for new , @xmath51-th , column / row @xmath55 and again for the diagonal element @xmath56     in the case of growing graphs @xmath57 .",
    "the gray sites show randomly chosen columns / rows ( nodes to which new node will be attached ) .",
    "the black sites show matrix elements which are reevaluated from eq . due to newly created shortcuts .",
    "the last columns / rows are constructed according eqs . and . starting with the y - like star new nodes were subsequently added to nodes @xmath58 . ]",
    "one step of construction of the matrix @xmath5 for simple graphs @xmath57 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_matrix ] .",
    "an example of the construction @xmath5 for trees @xmath14 is given in @xcite .",
    "in figs . [ fig_met_exp ] and [ fig_met_ab ] the dependences ( a ) @xmath59 and ( b ) @xmath60 obtained from growth simulations are presented , for exponential trees and for scale - free trees , respectively .",
    "the results of simulations are averaged over @xmath61 independent growths . for both kinds of trees",
    "the difference in average node - node distance @xmath62 tends to the constant value during the growth process . for higher moments",
    "the effect is even stronger and @xmath63 increases with the tree size @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_met_exp ] we give also the results for @xmath64 and @xmath65 calculated with eq . for exponential trees of @xmath66 nodes .",
    "the fact that @xmath62 and @xmath63 do not decrease with @xmath0 means that growing structures preserve the memory on their initial shapes .    in the case of simple graphs ( @xmath50 ) , the distance matrix @xmath5 must be reevaluated , what makes the time of the calculation substantially larger .",
    "the results for graphs are averaged only over one thousand of independent growths .",
    "the curves @xmath19 and @xmath67 for both kind of simple graphs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dn ] .",
    "the linear fits for @xmath68 are @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the exponential graphs and the scale - free graphs , respectively . the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 for both kind of evolving graphs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_meg ] .",
    "for the scale - free graphs , we observe some small memory effect , which manifests as a constant mutual shift of the plots @xmath67 vs. @xmath71 . in this case",
    "it is not clear if the effect vanishes or not , when @xmath0 tends to infinity .     and ( b ) @xmath65 for _ exponential trees _ obtained with iterative formula as well as from the direct growth simulations .",

    "the results are averaged over @xmath72 independent growths.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in the case of the exponential trees , the results of the simulations agree well with the curves obtained from the iteration equations .",
    "this fact supports the reliability of the numerical equation for the scale - free trees and the graphs with @xmath50 , where we have no analytical calculations .",
    "main result of this work is , that the node - node distance distribution in a growing tree depends on its initial structure .",
    "our calculations indicate , that both the average distance @xmath30 and its second moment @xmath73 in trees display this kind of memory .",
    "the information is encoded in the constant @xmath74 in the expression @xmath75 .",
    "the constant @xmath74 varies by about 0.109 and 0.164 , when we change the shape of the initial tree of four nodes from the y - like star to the z - like chain for the exponential and scale - free trees , respectively . in the second moment",
    "@xmath76 , it is the constant @xmath77 which depends on the initial shape .",
    "this is true both for the exponential and the scale - free trees .",
    "the memory effect is much reduced or even disappears in the case when new nodes are linked to the network by at least two edges . in this case , the distance matrix @xmath5 is rebuilt by new edges which can shorten distances between initially far nodes by providing new paths between them .",
    "concluding , we have demonstrated that the growing trees carry an information on their initial geometrical structure .",
    "the validity of this result relies not only on pure geometry , but also on a particular application of the graph theory .",
    "as remarked in the introduction , the list of examples of such applications is quite rich @xcite .",
    "if the considered network is due to the citation index , we trace the flow of a new idea from one paper to another .",
    "we see that around some seminal papers , networks of citations are formed , as it happens in the case of ref .",
    "sometimes there are two or more seminal papers , and then the shape of the network depends on their clarity , ease of mathematical formulation and individual preferences of the readership , formed in personal contacts .",
    "if new results spread just by reading papers , it spreads slowly : somebody reads it , tells to a friend , the friend s student is asked to calculate a similar problem .",
    "the tree is ` chain - like ' . on the contrary",
    ", each conference makes the tree of spreading of ideas to be more ` star - like ' , where the possible sources of getting new information are multiple and efficient .",
