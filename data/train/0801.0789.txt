    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) devices hold great promise as basic tools for quantum networks @xcite since they provide an interface between computation and communication , i.e. , between atoms and photons . in this context , it is a very important task to coherently manipulate and control quantum state of not only the atom but also the intracavity fields . throughout the last decade , in cavity qed including the microwave and optical regimes many efforts have been devoted to generation of entangled states , nonclassical states , and the implementation of quantum logical gates for cavity fields .",
    "some relevant examples are schrdinger cat state @xcite , fock state of a single - mode cavity field @xcite , the maximally entangled state of two cavity modes @xcite , pair coherent states and @xmath2 coherent states @xcite .",
    "in fact , three different schemes were proposed to realize a quantum phase gate of two intracavity modes in which a single atom with @xmath3-type @xcite , @xmath4- type @xcite , or @xmath5-type @xcite configuration mediated the interaction between them .",
    "recently , serra et al .",
    "@xcite and zou et al .",
    "@xcite showed the methods for realizing frequency up- and down - conversions in a two - mode microwave cavity based on dispersive interaction and resonant interaction , respectively .",
    "most of the schemes mentioned above are based on the interaction of single atoms and the cavity fields . in the past few years",
    ", many interesting schemes have been proposed that use atomic ensembles with a large number of identical atoms placed in an optical cavity as the basic system for quantum state engineering and quantum information processing @xcite . in particular , several experiments",
    "have been reported about continuous variable entanglement using cold atoms @xcite and the photon statistics of the light emitted from an atomic ensemble into a single cavity mode @xcite .",
    "theoretically , some schemes have also been proposed for realizing frequency down - conversions two - mode field squeezing using atomic ensemble as medium @xcite and carrying out quantum phase - gate operation for two single photons using an @xmath1-type atomic ensemble trapped in an optical cavity @xcite or an m - type atomic ensemble trapped in a gas cell @xcite .",
    "the above schemes based on atomic ensembles have some special advantages compared with those based on the control of single atoms : first , laser manipulation of atomic ensembles without separately addressing the individual atoms is normally easier than the coherent control of single particles ; second , and more important , atomic ensembles could have some kinds of collectively enhanced coupling to certain optical mode due to the many - atom interference effects .    in this paper , we present a method that realizes frequency up - conversions and a quantum swap gate for two cavity modes with a v - type atomic ensemble in an optical cavity . in the scheme ,",
    "the cavity - field degree of freedom is decoupled from the atomic degrees of freedom and the effective coupling strength scales up with @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 is the number of atoms ) .",
    "the scheme is robust against decoherence processes , such as spontaneous emission , and does not require a strong coupling regime or precise atomic localization .",
    "the numerical simulation shows that the swap gate has high fidelity and small error rate under the influence of the atomic spontaneous emission and the decay of the cavity modes .",
    "our model consists of an ensemble of n identical v - type atoms inside a two - mode optical cavity .",
    "the concrete atomic level structure and relevant transitions are shown in fig",
    ". 1 .     and",
    "@xmath6 correspond to two excited states  while @xmath7 is a stable ground state .",
    "the transitions @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath6 of each atom couple to the cavity modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 with coupling strengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . simultaneously the external laser field with rabi frequency @xmath15 drives the raman transition @xmath16.,width=172",
    "]    each atom has a stable ground state @xmath7 and two excited states @xmath9 and @xmath17 .",
    "the transition @xmath18 @xmath19 ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) of the jth atom couples to the cavity mode @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) with coupling strength @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , while laser field with rabi frequency @xmath24 drives the transition @xmath25 @xmath21 ( @xmath24 can be realized by using a two - photon raman transition via level @xmath26 , or a fourth level @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for the whole system in the interaction picture can be written as @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "after defining the new atomic basis @xmath30  @xmath31 , @xmath32  @xmath33 @xcite , one can rewrite @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the time evolution of this system is decided by schrdinger s equation @xmath38=h_{i}\\left\\vert \\psi(t)\\right\\rangle .\\ ] ] after performing the unitary transformation @xmath39 one can obtain @xmath40=h_{ii}\\left\\vert \\psi^{^{\\prime}}(t)\\right\\rangle , \\ ] ] where @xmath41    assuming that all atoms are initially in the ground state @xmath42 , and @xmath43 we neglect the effect of rapidly oscillating terms . using the time - averaging method of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can further reduce @xmath44 to an effective interaction hamiltonian @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the effective coupling constant .",
    "( 7 ) is the expected frequency up - conversion process , which belongs to a group of nonlinear phenomena of great practical importance and also has very interesting theoretical aspects @xcite . compared with the previous theoretical protocols for realizing frequency up - conversion with an atom in a microwave cavity @xcite , the effective coupling constant @xmath47 in our scheme scales with @xmath0 though the rabi frequency of laser field @xmath48 should satisfy the conditions in eq .",
    "( 6 ) . in principle",
    "we can obtain a desired coupling strength as long as enough atoms simultaneously interact with the cavity modes and laser field .",
    "next we will show in detail the implementation of a quantum swap gate based on eq .",
    "suppose that the zero- and one - photon fock states of two different polarization ( or different frequency ) modes of the radiation field inside the cavity represent two logical states of a qubit .",
    "when the atoms are initially prepared in their ground states @xmath49 through optical pumping @xcite and are driven by the two cavity modes and the appropriate laser field ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the time evolution of four logical states for two qubits , under the effective hamiltonian in eq . ( 7 ) , are given by @xmath50 where we have assumed @xmath47 is real without loss of generality .",
    "after the effective interaction time @xmath51 , one has @xmath52 which represent a swap gate operation , apart from phase factors that can be eliminated by an appropriate setting of the phase of subsequent logic operations @xcite .",
    "we note that the swap gate is not a required composition of elementary gates from a universal set for quantum computation , which can be decomposed into three quantum phase gates and six hadamard gates @xcite .",
    "our aim for the direct construction of a specific gate swap gate is to reduce the number of required physical logical gates in practical quantum information processes .",
    "we also note that sangouard et al .",
    "@xcite and yavuz @xcite have proposed the scheme for direct swap gate for the atoms by adiabatic passage and for the photons by using electromagnetically induced transparency , respectively .    in the following ,",
    "we analyze the fidelity of the swap gate and the photon loss during the gate operation .",
    "we suppose that no photon is detected either by the atomic spontaneous emission or by the leakage of a photon through the cavity mirrors .",
    "the evolution of the system is governed by the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the decay rate of the cavity mode fields a and b , @xmath56 is spontaneous emission rate of the excited state @xmath57 . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we assume @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 in the following numerical simulations @xcite , so it can be seen @xmath63 .",
    "if the initial state of the atom - cavity system is prepared in @xmath64 , after the effective interaction time @xmath51 under the non - hermitian hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the conditional state can be described by @xmath65 , here @xmath66 @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "so the photon loss due to quantum jump can be calculated by @xmath71 .",
    "2 ( a ) plots the numerical calculation of the photon loss as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "the fidelity of the swap gate , which depends on the initially state of the system , is an efficient measure of the distance between the quantum logic gates .",
    "we define the fidelity ( f ) of the swap gate as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 refers to the state of the system in the ideal case after the gate operation for the initial state @xmath75 , and @xmath76 since we have assumed that no quantum jump actually occurs during our implementation of the scheme @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) , the swap gate has high fidelity even if the strongly coupled condition is not satisfied .",
    "in an optical cavity , the coupling strengths @xmath77 @xmath23 , and @xmath48 depend on the position * r * of atom j. however , in presence of a large number of atoms , due to the many - atom interference effects resulting in the atoms collectively enhanced coupling to certain optical mode , it is possible to estimate that even for a high effective coupled parameter @xmath47 and does not require a strong coupling regime or precise atomic localization inside a wavelength @xcite , which is important for current experimental technique . in our scheme the atoms are prepared in their ground states @xmath42 and no atomic transition is required .",
    "thus our scheme is robust against atomic spontaneous emission .",
    "next we briefly address the experimental feasibility of the proposed scheme .",
    "we consider a low density vapor of @xmath78 in an optical cavity . the required atomic level configuration can be chosen from the hyperfine states of @xmath78 .",
    "for instance , the lower level @xmath7 is the @xmath79 hyperfine state of the @xmath80 electronic ground state , while @xmath9 and @xmath6 are the @xmath81 hyperfine states of the @xmath82 electronic excited states , respectively . using the cavity parameters of ref @xcite",
    ", we have the waist of the cavity modes @xmath83 , the waist of the homogeneous classical laser beam @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . with the choices of @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    ", we obtain an approximate atom number density of @xmath88 ( small enough to prevent coherence losses due to collisions ) , and the effective coupling constant @xmath89 .",
    "thus the swap gate operation time is @xmath90 , which is much smaller than the photon lifetime @xmath91 .",
    "hence , our scheme fits well the status of current experimental technology .    in summary",
    ", we have proposed a scheme to realize frequency - up conversion and a swap gate for intracavity fields with atomic ensemble . in our scheme",
    ", the atoms collectively enhance coupling strength to the intracavity fields due to the many - atom interference effects . in presence of a large number of atoms",
    ", our scheme may relax the requirements of the strong - coupling condition and lamb - dicke limit , which is important for current experimental technique .",
    "we also discuss the fidelity of the swap  gate and the probability of the photon loss under the influence of the atomic spontaneous emission and the decay of the cavity modes .",
    "it is shown that the swap  gate has a high fidelity and small error rate .",
