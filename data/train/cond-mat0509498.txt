    "the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute trapped and supercooled atomic vapors  @xcite has stimulated enormous experimental and theoretical interest in the physics of the weakly interacting bose gas ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "especially intriguing is the role of dimensionality and two - body interactions .",
    "lower dimensional atomic gases have been realized with strong quantum confinement in one or more directions .",
    "these systems exhibit very peculiar properties , such as the exact mapping between interacting bosons and noninteracting fermions ( tonks - girardeau gas )  @xcite , because the role of quantum fluctuations and strong correlations is enhanced .",
    "although these gases are very dilute , bec of trapped atomic gases is strongly influenced by two - body interactions . within a mean - field approximation ,",
    "the strength of the interatomic interactions can be typically characterized by a single parameter , the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 , at very low temperatures .",
    "this van der waals type interaction is isotropic and short - range in comparison to the average interparticle separation .",
    "accordingly , bose - einstein condensates created thus far have been very accurately described by the gross - pitaevskii theory ( see @xcite for a review ) , a mean - field approach .",
    "furthermore , it has been possible to tune the s - wave scattering length @xmath1 to essentially any value , positive or negative , by utilizing a magnetic atom - atom feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "studies of the influence of the interparticle interactions on the properties of bec have focused mainly on the short - range interactions  @xcite . however , understanding new kinds of systems will require the investigation of the effects of additional interactions , since bose - einstein condensation of molecules has now been observed using new techniques for creating ultracold molecules  @xcite .",
    "in addition , ling _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an efficient method to convert atomic condensates into stable molecules using a generalized raman adiabatic passage scheme .",
    "very recently , the generation of a bec in a gas of @xmath2cr atoms was reported  @xcite .",
    "as molecules can potentially have large dipole moments and a chromium atom has a very high magnetic moment of 6@xmath3 ( bohr magneton ) in its ground state , bec with dipole - dipole interactions in ultracold gases has attracted considerable theoretical attention over the past few years  @xcite .",
    "compared to the short - range interaction , the dipole - dipole interactions are long - range , anisotropic , and partially attractive . as a result ,",
    "nonlinear effects due to long - range dipole - dipole interactions lead to new interesting properties ; different quantum phases such as superfluid , supersolid , mott insulator , checkerboard , and collapse phases  @xcite , a self - bound bose condensate in the field of a traveling wave  @xcite , a roton minimum in the excitation spectrum  @xcite , and promising candidates for the implementation of fast and robust quantum - computing schemes  @xcite .",
    "first of all , yi and you  @xcite suggested an effective pseudopotential for anisotropic dipolar interactions in the born approximation and recently derevianko  @xcite derived a more rigorous velocity - dependent pseudopotential for dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed a strong dependence of the stability of trapped dipolar bec on the trapping geometry .",
    "odell _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite derived exact results in the thomas - fermi regime for the statics and dynamics of a trapped dipolar bec .",
    "however , in all the theoretical studies so far the t=0 k situation has been investigated . in this paper",
    "we address the properties of trapped condensates with dipolar interactions at finite temperatures .",
    "several sources for dipolar bec are atoms polarized by an electric field or atoms with large magnetic moments in addition to polar molecules .",
    "the magnitude and sign of dipole - dipole interactions can be changed by rapidly rotating an external field  @xcite .",
    "thus , by varying the strength of the dipolar interactions relative to the s - wave scattering ( tuning the dipolar interaction or changing the s - wave scattering length @xmath1 ) it is possible to study the effects of the dipolar interaction on a condensate in detail .    in this paper we attempt to understand bose - einstein condensation of trapped dipolar gases , where the interparticle interaction consists of a long - range dipole - dipole interaction in addition to the usual short - range s - wave interaction ( a purely repulsive hard - sphere potential ) .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate the influence of dipole - dipole forces on the properties of ultracold gases by comparing the energetics and structural properties of harmonically trapped atomic condensates with dipolar interactions with those for which only short - range interactions are present .",
    "in addition , we study the dependence of the sign and the value of the dipole - dipole interaction energy on the trapping geometry by using two different types of cylindrical traps ( a cigar - shaped trap and a disk - shaped trap ) . for these purposes",
    ", we use a finite - temperature path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method  @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follow .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] introduces the hamiltonian of trapped dipolar hard - sphere systems used in this studies and an effective pseudopotential to describe anisotropic dipolar interactions in the born approximation .",
    "the path integral monte carlo technique briefly is also reviewed in sec .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] presents our simulation results .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "we wish to study the problem of a quantum @xmath4-particle system to consider a harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensation in three dimensions .",
    "the quantum particles have both a long - range dipole - dipole interaction and the usual short - range hard - sphere interaction .",
    "we assume that all atomic dipole moments are equal and oriented along the @xmath5-axis ( trap axis ) . within the born approximation , the dipole - dipole interaction potential between two dipoles separated by @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 characterizes the dipole moment , @xmath9 is the vector between the dipoles @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the angle between the vector @xmath6 and the direction of the dipoles ( @xmath13 ) . to date , this pseudopotential has worked reasonably well for the long - range dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is then @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hamiltonian for trapped ideal boson gases and @xmath16 is the hard - sphere potential defined by @xmath17 in order to investigate the dependence of the sign and the value of the dipole - dipole interaction energy on the trapping geometry , we consider bose gases under a cylindrically harmonic confinement ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 is the aspect ratio .    consider a system of @xmath4 dipolar hard spheres .",
    "the statistical mechanics of a quantum system at an inverse temperature @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denotes the boltzmann constant , is governed by the density matrix .",
    "the bose - symmetrized density matrix is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two configurations of @xmath4 dipolar hard spheres , which denote @xmath27 dimensional vectors , @xmath25 = @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 denotes a permutation of particle labels among hard spheres and @xmath30 is one such permutation .",
    "the inclusion of particle permutations is crucial and superfluidity is an immediate consequence of bose symmetry .",
    "however , evaluating the density matrix for interacting systems at very low temperatures is complicated by the fact that the kinetic and potential terms in the exponent of the density matrix do not commute . in order to avoid this problem , we insert @xmath31 intermediate configurations into eq .",

    ".  [ eq - dm2 ] can be evaluated in the path integral monte carlo technique by a stochastic sampling of the discrete paths @xmath37 using multilevel monte carlo sampling  @xcite , which accounts for permutations . in order to use monte carlo sampling",
    ", we must first provide a pair - product form of the exact two - body density matrices .",
    "for the short - range hard - sphere potential , we used the high - temperature approximation for the hard - sphere propagator derived by cao and berne  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is impractical to develop an analytic pair - product form for the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction potential . thus the primitive approximation , which separates the density matrix into kinetic and potential energy terms , was used . in order to choose the value of the number of time slices @xmath35 , we performed consistency checks by varying @xmath35 to see that the results had converged .",
    "we used up to 160 time slices ( @xmath35 = 160 ) depending on the temperature and the number of particles .",
    "we employed the canonical ensemble , @xmath38 in each simulation we fixed the temperature @xmath39 , the number of particles @xmath4 , the diameter of a hard sphere @xmath1 , and the strength of the dipolar interactions @xmath8 .",
    "the thermal expectation value of an operator @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 .",
    "expectation values are calculated at the same time the discrete paths are sampled . typically 20,000 - 30,000 mc steps are required for equilibration and statistical averages are collected from 150,000 - 180,000 mc steps after this . in each mc step , we attempted 60 - 1,250 trial moves at each time slice .",
    "multiple runs were performed for each set of parameters so that statistical error bars could be determined .",
