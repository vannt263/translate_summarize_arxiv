    "higher twist corrections to hadronic interactions become increasingly important at high energies .",
    "an effective way to resum all these contributions is the color glass condensate picture .",
    "we review the kharzeev - levin - nardi ( kln)@xcite approach to heavy ion collisions , which has successfully been applied to rhic physics , and extrapolate this model to iron - air collisions at energies up to the gzk ( @xmath0  ev ) cutoff .",
    "so far , we only calculate multiplicities . in the near future",
    ", we hope to present a full model which also treats the forward scattering in detail , which is important for air showers .",
    "in ref . @xcite we introduced the black body limit ( bbl ) model for hadron - nucleus reactions .",
    "valence quarks scatter coherently off the gluon field in the target .",
    "the transverse momentum acquired in this reaction is of the order of the saturation momentum , defined by the density of gluons in the target .",
    "this leads to independent fragmentation of the leading quarks at high energies , when the saturation momentum is high .",
    "the leading baryon effect known from lower energies is suppressed .",
    "gluon production in this approach is realized within the kln model : a simple ansatz for the unintegrated gluon distribution function ( ugdf ) is applied to the @xmath1-factorization formula . in this paper",
    ", we apply this model to iron - air collisions .",
    "the dotted line shows the ugdf for the averaged low density . ]     to be proportional to the average density @xmath2 .",
    "the data is from phobos @xcite . ]    in the @xmath3-factorization approach  @xcite , the distribution of produced gluons is given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 the number of colors . here ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the produced gluons , respectively .",
    "the light - cone momentum fractions of the colliding gluon ladders are then given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the center of mass energy and @xmath7 is the rapidity of the produced gluon .",
    "we set @xmath10 such that the minimal saturation scale @xmath11 in the above integration is @xmath12  gev .",
    "the kln approach  @xcite employs the following ugdf : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the saturation momentum at the given momentum fraction @xmath15 and transverse position @xmath16 .",
    "the overall normalization is determined by the multiplicity at mid - rapidity for the most central collisions . the saturation scale for nucleus @xmath17",
    "is taken to be proportional to the density of participants , @xmath18 .",
    "this is not a universal quantity which depends only on the properties of a single nucleus , in other words , the ugdf is not fully factorizable .    .",
    "the vertical lines denote the forward and mid - rapidities for the different energy regions . ]",
    "a possible solution seems to be to define the saturation momentum squared to be proportional to @xmath19 , which is dependent on one nucleus only and therefore respects factorization .",
    "however , this ansatz can not describe the data on the multiplicity as a function of centrality for au - au collisions at rhic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npart ] .",
    "why this does not work can best be seen with the following example .",
    "we consider a peripheral au - au collision , and want to construct the ugdf at the edge of one of the nuclei . here",
    ", @xmath2 is very small , which means that only in some nucleus configurations , we actually find a nucleon at this position .",
    "let us denote the probability to find ( at least ) one nucleon with @xmath20 .",
    "the ugdf at this position is then @xmath20 times the ugdf of a single nucleon , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi ] ( dashed line ) . taking",
    "the average density @xmath2 would lead to the dotted line , and gives the wrong ugdf , since averaging has to be done after constructing the wave function and not before .",
    "the density under the condition to find at least one nucleon is @xmath21 , see @xcite for details .",
    "the saturation scale is therefore :    @xmath22    and the ansatz for the ugdf is @xmath23 in ref .",
    "@xcite we explain that the multiplicity is a homogeneous function of order one in the density of both nuclei , and the @xmath24 description is a good approximation of the factorized kln approach .",
    "fm ) pb - pb collisions at the lhc . ]      before showing some results and extrapolating to high energies we want do discuss the evolution of the saturation scale as a function of the energy .",
    "[ fig : qss ] shows @xmath14 as a function of the rapidity for fixed coupling and running coupling evolution .",
    "@xcite for details on these two types .",
    "the two evolution types show large differences at forward rapidity for lhc and gzk energies .",
    "differences at mid - rapidity for rhic and lhc are however less significant . therefore , fixed and running coupling predict very similar results for rhic and lhc overall multiplicities .",
    "very good agreement with the data from the phobos collaboration @xcite is shown for the multiplicity at mid - rapidity as a function of centrality , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npart ] . as already stated , the differences between fixed and running coupling evolution are small .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndeta_lhc ] we see predictions for central ( b=2.4  fm ) pb - pb collisions at the lhc ( @xmath25gev ) .",

    "[ fig : npart_lhc ] .              fig .",
    "[ fig : fen_lhc ] shows the rapidity dependence of charged particles for central iron - nitrogen collisions at the three reference energies for rhc , lhc and gzk ( 200 gev , 5500 gev and 400 tev , respectively ) . up to lhc energies , differences at mid - rapidity are smaller than 15% . only at gzk energies , we see a qualitative difference .",
    "[ fig : fen_elab2 ] shows the total multiplicity of charged particles as a function of the lab - energy per nucleon . since in cosmic ray",
    "physics the energy of a nucleus is usually the total energy , plotting @xmath26 is a useful quantity when comparing to proton - air collisions .",
    "we also compare to the standard hadronic interactions models sibyll  2.1 @xcite and qgsjet - iic  @xcite .",
    "first , we observe that nucleus air collisions in sibyll are obtained by superposition of hadron air collisions .",

    "screening in the initial state reduces the multiplicity .",
    "the predicted results of these two approaches are quite similar up to lhc energies , whereas above this energy , qgsjet - ii predicts higher multiplicity than the color glass approach ( running coupling evolution ) .",
