    "the growing dependence of users on wireless services will require wireless systems to become ubiquitous and offer seamless support .",
    "the demands of video and other high data rate applications have placed increasing requirements on networks to support high data rate services in a cost effective manner leading to heterogeneous networks . with the advent of ofdma - based heterogeneous networks",
    "@xcite which incorporate lower power pico @xcite , femto base stations @xcite , and fixed relays @xcite to coexist with the traditional macrocell , the spectrum reuse has grown aggressively to full usage pattern across different tiers @xcite of the heterogeneous structure .",
    "one challenging feature of heterogeneous networks is the self - created  cell edges \" within the macrocell , which requires advanced techniques both in theory and in practice to model @xcite , manage @xcite , and even make use of the cross - tier intercell interference . among the recent approaches that have been developed such as subcarrier allocation and power control to carefully adapt the system resource in a centralized way @xcite , and utilization of spatial domain for cooperative multicell processing to cancel , coordinate , and align the interference @xcite , a significant impediment is the np - hardness of the problem @xcite , the limited resource constraints , as well as the need for extensive backhaul capability .",
    "these challenges favor the development of distributed solutions .",
    "all the aforementioned techniques in the downlink assume the availability of channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) via feedback @xcite to adapt the network transmission strategy to the varying wireless environment . with the rapidly growing number of wireless users , the amount of feedback for the ofdma - based networks may become prohibitive which motivates the design of efficient feedback schemes without significantly degrading system performance .",
    "in addition to the usual challenges , there are two new issues that arise when investigating partial feedback in heterogeneous networks .",
    "firstly , due to the different locations of the users and different ranges of transmit powers , users large scale channel effects are highly asymmetric . therefore , it is equally important to guarantee fairness among users as well as leveraging multiuser diversity @xcite in an opportunistic scheduling framework . secondly , since the number of users or user densities are diverse in a heterogeneous network , it would be beneficial to adapt the feedback and require less feedback when a serving base station has more users associated with it .",
    "we refer to this methodology as heterogeneous partial feedback and we aim to provide an analytical framework to identify its benefits under a fair and distributed opportunistic scheduling policy to fulfill the vision of location awareness @xcite and situational awareness .",
    "the first step towards examining the aforementioned issues is developing an opportunistic scheduling policy , which exploits multiuser diversity and also preserves scheduling fairness among heterogeneous users .",
    "traditional scheduling policies such as round robin strategy @xcite and greedy strategy @xcite are easy to implement , yet only achieve one of the desired features . in this paper",
    ", we consider a system that employs the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) based scheduling policy @xcite . according to the basic cdf - based scheduling strategy",
    ", an user is selected whose rate is high enough , but least probable to grow higher .",
    "therefore , this scheduling strategy possesses properties similar to the proportional fair scheduler @xcite , and additionally enables a user s rate to be independent of the statistics of other users .",
    "herein , the cdf - based scheduling policy is analyzed for a general ofdma downlink in a multicell environment to examine heterogeneous partial feedback design .",
    "currently , in an ofdma - based system which groups subcarriers into resource blocks @xcite to form the basic scheduling and feedback unit , two partial feedback strategies are appealing : the thresholding - based partial feedback @xcite and the best - m partial feedback @xcite .",
    "the latter strategy , which is considered in practical systems such as lte @xcite , requires the users to order and convey the m best channels .",
    "herein , we employ the best - m partial feedback strategy for further analysis .",
    "intuitively , m would be chosen to be small when the user density in a given cell is large , which motivates the utilization of heterogeneous feedback resource across different cells in the heterogeneous networks .",
    "rigorous development of the analytical framework requires investigation of the interplay between the scheduling policy , partial feedback , and the statistical property of the user s signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "there are limited results available in the literature on this topic and the available results analyzing the best - m partial feedback are for the single cell scenario without intercell interference @xcite .",
    "a detailed treatment of the best - m partial feedback is provided in @xcite and a convenient polynomial form for the cdf of selected user s @xmath0 is presented for analytical evaluation . though it is derived for the single cell scenario , it forms the building block for our heterogeneous network analysis which takes into account the cross - tier intercell interference . in this paper , the analytical framework",
    "is treated first from the perspective of exact system performance .",
    "we derive the closed form expression for the sum rate with the cdf - based scheduling policy and best - m partial feedback strategy .",
    "one key technique developed and utilized is the decomposition of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the selected user s @xmath0 , which is amenable for further integration needed to determine system performance .",
    "the derived closed form results are directly applicable to further system evaluation .    in order to gain additional insight",
    ", we investigate the system performance from the asymptotic perspective utilizing extreme value theory @xcite when the number of users in a given cell grows large @xcite .",
    "different from the special case of full feedback , examining the general best - m partial feedback incurs additional difficulties due to the two - stage maximization resulting from partial feedback and scheduling policy , with the first stage maximization being performed at the user side to provide selective feedback and the second stage maximization being performed at the scheduler side for user selection .",
    "herein , we analyze the tail behavior of the selected user s @xmath0 and establish the type of convergence in order to examine the effect of partial feedback on the randomness of multiuser diversity , show the optimality of best-1 feedback in the asymptotic sense , and more importantly , provide the asymptotic approximation for the sum rate of the general best - m partial feedback .",
    "the established asymptotic results further help in analytically tracking and determining the minimum required partial feedback .    to summarize , the contributions of this paper are threefold : a conceptual framework for situational - aware heterogeneous partial feedback design in an ofdma - based heterogeneous multicell network , a thorough analysis and derivation of closed form results for the sum rate , and a detailed investigation of the partial feedback based on extreme value theory .",
    "all these contributions foster the understanding of heterogeneous feedback design in future systems .",
    "furthermore , the analytical tools developed promise to have broad applicability and can be applied to many related problems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is provided in section [ system ] .",
    "the general treatment without specific channel models is examined in section [ scheduling ] . by assuming standard channel models , section [ exact ] carries out exact performance analysis , and section [ asymptotic ] presents asymptotic analysis .",
    "numerical results are provided in section [ numerical ] , and section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider the downlink of an ofdma - based heterogeneous network .",
    "the model assumed is generic and sufficiently general to be applicable to a multitier multicell network , e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] for illustration .",
    "the system consists of @xmath1 resource blocks , with one resource block as the basic feedback and scheduling unit .",

    "the @xmath0 is the channel quality information ( cqi ) that will be fed back and used for scheduling as discussed next .",
    "this section is devoted to the analysis of the interplay between the scheduling policy and partial feedback for a general channel model ( note that no assumption on the distribution of the large and small scale channel gains has been made so far ) , with treatment of specific channel model in section [ exact ] .",
    "let @xmath25 represent @xmath26 for notational simplicity and denote it as the cqi of user @xmath7 at resource block @xmath8 with cdf @xmath27 .",
    "the cdf does not depend on the resource block index @xmath8 because the @xmath26 s are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) across resource blocks @xmath8 for a given user @xmath7 . now consider the feedback procedure utilizing the best - m partial feedback strategy .",
    "according to the best - m partial feedback strategy , users measure cqi for each resource block at their receiver and feed back the cqi values of the @xmath28 best resource blocks chosen from the total of @xmath1 values .",
    "more details on the best - m partial feedback approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "this selective feedback procedure involves a maximization stage at each user . because only a subset of the ordered cqi are fed back , from the perspective of the scheduler ( i.e.",
    ", the serving base station @xmath2 ) , if it receives feedback on a certain resource block from a user , it is likely to be any one of the cqi from the ordered subset .",
    "we now aim to find the cdf of the cqi seen at the scheduler side as a consequence of partial feedback .",
    "denote @xmath29 as the received cqi at the scheduler for user @xmath7 at resource block @xmath8 under best - m partial feedback , which is the outcome of the user side maximization .",
    "let @xmath30 be its cdf , with resource block index @xmath8 dropped due to the i.i.d .",
    "property across resource blocks for a given user .",
    "it is easy to see that for the full feedback case , i.e. , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and for the best-1 feedback case , i.e. , @xmath33 , @xmath34 . utilizing the results in @xcite ,",
    "the cdf for the general best - m feedback case can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "after the scheduler receives feedback from its serving users , it is ready to perform scheduling .",
    "it is clear that for the single cell scenario without intercell interference , the scheduling policy is easier to implement and analyze .",
    "for instance , in the single cell scenario with homogeneous users , namely same large scale effects , the greedy scheduler or the max-@xmath37 scheduler makes full use of multiuser diversity as well as guarantees fairness due to the same statistics of the user s cqi . in the single cell scenario with heterogeneous users ,",
    "i.e. , different large scale effects @xcite , the normalized greedy scheduler which selects user according to their normalized cqi has the same desired property .",
    "however , in the general multicell scenario with intercell interference , the @xmath26 s are independent but non - identically distributed ( i.n.i.d . ) across users .",
    "therefore , the received cqi at the scheduler for different users @xmath29 are i.n.i.d . across users . in order to leverage multiuser diversity and guarantee fairness ,",
    "we employ the cdf - based scheduling policy @xcite . according to the cdf - based scheduling policy",
    ", the scheduler will utilize the distribution of the received cqi for each user , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "herein , it is assumed that the scheduler perfectly knows the cdf , and it conducts the following transformation @xmath38 the transformed random variable @xmath39 is uniformly distributed over the range from @xmath40 to @xmath41 and can be regarded as the virtual received cqi of user @xmath7 at resource block @xmath8 .",
    "the transformed random variables @xmath39 s are i.i.d . across users , which enables the maximization at the scheduler side to perform fair scheduling . denoting @xmath42 as the random variable representing the selected user for transmission at resource block @xmath8 , then @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the set of users who convey feedback for resource block @xmath8 .",
    "it can be easily seen that when @xmath31 , @xmath45 . for the general case",
    "when @xmath46 , the probability mass function ( pmf ) of @xmath47 can be shown to be @xmath48 after the user @xmath42 is selected according to ( [ system_eq_5 ] ) , the scheduler utilizes the corresponding @xmath49 for rate matching of the selected user .",
    "we denote the random variable @xmath50 as the selected user s cqi for resource block @xmath8 , and use the sum rate as the system performance metric .",

    "remark : _ a few remarks are in order .",
    "firstly , the effect of best - m partial feedback and the cdf - scheduling policy result in a two stage maximization .",

    "the second stage maximization is conducted at the scheduler side by performing cdf - based transformation and user scheduling .",
    "secondly , with the help of cdf - based scheduling , each user feels as if the other users had the same cdf for scheduling competition @xcite . in other words ,",
    "each individual user s rate is independent of other users .",
    "this important feature not only enables the distributed system to enjoy multiuser diversity , but also makes it possible to consider or predict each user s rate by only considering its own cdf .",
    "thirdly , users are equiprobable to be scheduled despite of their heterogeneous channels ( e.g. , different statistics due to diverse propagation environments and interference levels ) , and so the scheduling policy maintains fairness among users .",
    "up to now , we have obtained the general form of the sum rate and individual user rate with the help of @xmath60 without assuming specific distributions on the channel models . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the closed form expression for @xmath60 with standard channel models .",

    "section [ statistics ] examines the pdf and cdf of the @xmath0 for each user and uses them to derive a closed form expression for @xmath60 in section [ procedure ] .      in a practical system setting , the time scale for the large scale and small scale channel effects are much different .",
    "the variation of the small scale channel gain @xmath66 occurs on the order of millisecond ; whereas the large scale channel gain @xmath67 which may consist of path loss , antenna gain , and shadowing , varies usually on the order of tens of seconds .",

    "two additional issues arise in the heterogeneous multicell setting under partial feedback when compared with the standard homogeneous setting under full feedback .",

    "the number of cqi values to maximize over at the scheduler is fixed and equals the number of the associated users @xmath111 .",
