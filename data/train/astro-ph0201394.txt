    "amateur astronomers have long been involved in the study of variable stars .",
    "organizations like the aavso ( http://www.aavso.org ) and the center for backyard astrophysics ( http://www.astro.bio2.edu/cba ) have promoted the study of a variety of phenomena by amateurs and overseen the collection of many years of high quality data .",
    "as technology , particularly the ccd , has become accessible to a wider ranger of enthusiasts , the opportunities for the amateur astronomer to conduct or lead scientific inquiry have grown tremendously .",
    "recent projects such as tass ( http://stupendous.rit.edu/tass/tass.shtml ) and hcrt ( http://www.mtco.com/~  jgunn ) have begun to make significant contributions along these lines .",
    "the importance of a comprehensive knowledge of variability across the entire sky has been outlined by paczyski ( 2001 ) and explored experimentally through projects such as asas ( pojmanski 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "approximately @xmath0 of all bright , existing variable stars are thought to be yet undiscovered , with asas finding that approximately @xmath1 of a set of 140,000 monitored stars turned out to be newly discovered variables with a wide range of periodicities , as discussed by eyer & blake ( 2001 ) .",
    "the potential contribution from the study of a set of several thousand stars , even for just a few nights , is enormous .",
    "the ultimate goal of the pvs has been to design a system to be utilized for just this purpose . in order for the desired scientific results to be achieved in as simple a manner as possible",
    ", a number of criteria must be met .",
    "availability of components , ease of implementation , and reproducibility of results were all key concerns during the development of the pvs system .",
    "today , a wide array of advanced devices are available to the savvy amateur and when these devices are combined with powerful and inexpensive computational resources , the ability to survey the sky from a backyard is shown to be well within reach",
    ". the optical and electronic components of the pvs are easily available through mail order , or even a local retailer , and products already widely owned by amateurs were integrated whenever possible .",
    "though the commercial hardware systems utilized in the pvs are shown to perform well , the power of the pvs design is derived from the software that controls all aspects of data collection and actively compensates for mechanical and electronic shortcomings in the hardware components .",
    "this collection of commercially available software products , all adhering to a set of inter - program cooperation guidelines called ascom ( http://ascom-standards.org ) , work together on a pc , under microsoft windows , to control a telescope , camera , and , if required , a telescope dome .",
    "these programs allow simple procedures to be controlled from a graphical user interface ( gui ) and for complex observing sessions and data reductions to be scripted in perl , visual basic script , or c++ languages .",
    "this paper provides descriptions of the hardware and software utilized in the pvs so that a similar system may be constructed by interested parties .",
    "examples are presented of the type and quality of results that may be expected .",
    "the pvs optical system centers around the popular meade lx200 schmidt - cassegrain telescope ( http://www.meade.com ) . this telescope is well known for its low price and ease of use , and was found to be of more than adequate optical and mechanical quality for the purposes of the pvs . here ,",
    "the 12 `` aperture model was utilized , with the standard f/10 to f/6.3 focal reducer , yielding a working plate scale of 82''/mm . in practice ,",
    "any of the meade lx200 schmidt - cassegrain telescopes could be used .",
    "the pvs lx200 is permanently mounted on a pier in equatorial configuration .",
    "care was taken to ensure that the telescope base was level and properly aligned with north celestial pole , following the instructions in the meade manual .",
    "although the instrument can be operated in an alt / az configuration , field rotation would be problematic .",
    "the telescope comes standard with the ability to communicate with a nearby pc via an rs-232 to serial port connector , facilitating the development of a robotic system .",
    "this communications cable can be easily assembled following instructions in the appendix of the meade manual and requires a four - wire rj11 standard phone cable and an rj11 to db9 ( 9 pin serial ) adapter .",
    "the voltages associated with this rs232 signal are very low , so it was found necessary to utilize a high quality shielded twisted pair phone cable , available at computer stores as a high speed modem cable . with this connection",
    ", encoders on both axes can be read out to the computer and dual axis motors actuated in response .",
    "the lx200 makes use of a large right ascension gear of 180 teeth with a period of approximately 8 minutes .",
    "the periodic error of this gear was found to prohibit unguided exposures of over 60 seconds in length , with peak to peak deviations of approximately @xmath2 .",
    "the telescope does have the ability to actively compensate by `` learning '' these errors through a training process during which an observer manually maintains the position of a guide star while the telescope s small integrated computer records these adjustments .",
    "the periodic error of the lx200 was not found to be reproducible between pointing positions or nights , and random tracking errors of @xmath3 remained even after training .",
    "an autoguider was utilized to compensate for these tracking errors during exposures at a rate of approximately 1hz , resulting in tracking accurate to the pixel level .",
    "the necessity of an autoguider does impose a limit on the percentage of the entire sky that is observable by pvs .",
    "since a reasonably bright guide star is required and in general a rotation of the camera is not possible during observations , only fields a fixed distance away from bright stars were observable .",
    "it was found that stars bright enough for guiding were abundant enough so that @xmath41/3 of all blind pointings happened to produce a usable guide star .",
    "when permanently mounted in equatorial mode , the lx200 requires only one alignment star in order to determine position .",
    "once the instrument is aligned to a bright star of known coordinates , the encoders will keep track of the telescope s right ascension and declination with reasonable accuracy for the duration of the night s observations . through the rs-232 connection ,",
    "the controlling pc can slew the telescope toward any set of coordinates .",
    "pointings across the entire sky were found to be accurate to within @xmath5 , placing the desired object well within the field of view of the ccd camera used by pvs .",
    "locally , the pointings were further enhanced to much higher accuracy . with the assistance of software , pointings to within a few arcseconds",
    "were routinely achieved during the data taking process .",
    "an important benefit resulting from the popularity of the meade lx200 model is the meade advanced products users group ( http://www.mapug.com ) , an on - line reference where hundreds of technically minded amateur astronomers have posted their experiences and insights into lx200 usage , design , and enhancement .",
    "one major problem with the lx200 optical design is the focusing mechanism .",
    "the focus is controlled through movement of the primary mirror , resulting in perceptible image shift and very poor focus repeatability .",
    "a new focuser , model ngf-2 manufactured by jim s mobile instruments ( http://www.jimsmobile.com ) , was added to remedy this problem .",
    "this motorized focuser , with an analog focus micrometer , was found to be very rigid and reliable .",
    "this addition adds several centimeters to the optical path length , resulting in slight vignetting at a level @xmath6 .",
    "optical filters of the 50 mm round variety were inserted into the optical path inside the focuser , as opposed to closer to the ccd chip , in order to help reduce vignetting effects and to ensure that any blemishes on the filter surface were well out of focus .",
    "optical filters manufactured by omega optical ( http://www.omegafilters.com ) were utilized .",
    "the system accommodates only a single filter at a time , but the filters may be easily switched by removing the ccd camera from the focuser . the focuser was attached to the rear cell of the telescope using a special wide aperture adapter plate purchased from jim s mobile instruments . to the front of the focuser was attached the focal reducer , and finally the camera was affixed with a t - thread adapter to the focal reducer .",
    "care was taken to ensure that the camera was aligned as closely as possible with the axes of the telescope in order to simplify guiding by aligning the rows and columns of the ccd chip with north , south , east , and west .",
    "the advent of the low cost ccd camera has revolutionized amateur astronomy .",
    "technology once available only at professional observatories is today within the reach of many dedicated home observers .",
    "several companies manufacture such ccd systems , but sbig ( http://www.sbig.com ) was chosen as a result of experiences with cameras from a variety of makers and as a result of sbig s reputation for innovation , quality , and good customer service .",
    "the model st-8e was selected as a reasonably priced , large format camera accessible to amateurs and schools .",
    "the 16-bit st-8e uses a kodak kaf-1602e ccd chip with an area of 1530 by 1020 pixels , each @xmath7 .",
    "this chip reaches a peak quantum efficiency of @xmath8 at a wavelength of 575 nm and slowly loses qe to @xmath9 at @xmath10 wavelength .",
    "an effort was made to calculate the throughput of the pvs system by observing the vega - like star hip 25593 ( aov , @xmath11 ) .",
    "a result was obtained comparable to an estimate based on the efficiencies reported by the manufacturers of the telescope , ccd , and filter . based on a calculated extinction coefficient of 0.09 mag / airmass in the i band , the vega flux standard at 555.6 nm of @xmath12 from hayes ( 1985 ) , and an assumed blackbody spectrum for hip 25593 ,",
    "the total system efficiency was calculated to be @xmath13 .",
    "using the published efficiencies of the ccd , telescope , and optical filter , and assuming the unknown efficiency of the focal reducer to be @xmath14 , a total system efficiency of @xmath15 was estimated .",
    "located adjacent to the imaging ccd on the same focal plane , is a smaller ti tc-211 chip used for autoguiding .",
    "both chips are cooled with a single stage thermoelectric device to approximately @xmath16c below ambient . at a chip temperature of @xmath17c ,",
    "the dark current is measured to be @xmath18 .",
    "the camera is mechanically shuttered , so the full kodak ccd is used for imaging at all times .",
    "the st-8e comes with the option of antiblooming circuitry which helps to lessen the effects of bleeding caused by an overexposed stellar image .",
    "many amateur astronomers choose this option since it is helpful in deep sky imaging .",
    "unfortunately , the antiblooming reduces the full well capacity of the ccd from @xmath19 to @xmath20 and may also be responsible for non - linear effects that are seen to occur as a pixel nears full well capacity .",
    "for use with the pvs , a non - antiblooming version of the camera was chosen .",
    "the st-8e reads out to the controlling pc via a parallel port interface in approximately 52 seconds , with a read noise of @xmath21rms . in conjunction with the previously described pvs optical system ,",
    "the st-8e yields a field of view of approximately @xmath22 by @xmath23 at a plate scale of @xmath24 with the use of the 0.63x focal reducer .",
    "all electronics are integrated into the head of the camera unit , so its total dimension is approximately 12 cm round with a total weight of 0.9 kg .",
    "this weight is positioned several centimeters from the rear of the optical tube , and must be balanced with a counterweight placed near the front of telescope .",
    "the computer control systems for the pvs instrument were all run and developed under microsoft windows 2000 .",
    "windows was chosen since it is far more accessible to the majority of amateur astronomers .",
    "the programs used by the pvs are all commercially available products that adhere to the guidelines of the astronomy common object model ( ascom , medkeff 2000 ) .",
    "ascom is a new and extremely powerful software concept that utilizes windows activex objects each representing an instrument component or a mathematical manipulation , in order to integrate the functions of a variety of independent software packages and facilitate the automation of an observing system . with products that incorporate ascom ,",
    "complex scripts may be written that may control an entire night of observations with data handling and control of the telescope , ccd , and dome .",
    "the ascom products also have the advantages of open source , since scripts with differing functions can be easily written and traded between observers .",
    "it was felt that the ascom initiative represented a new direction in amateur astronomy , and much of the pvs was designed around the usage of ascom compliant products . while ascom products were used here to control a meade telescope and sbig camera , the same programs and scripts may be used with a variety of different ccd cameras and telescope mounts .",
    "the telescope control software acpv2.0 ( http://acp.dc3.com ) was chosen to oversee telescope motion and pointing as well as coordinate and time transformations .",
    "the astrometric software pinpointv3.0 ( http://pinpoint.dc3.com ) was selected to manage all astrometric calculations .",
    "a wide variety of ccd camera control products are currently available , but maximdl / ccdv2.12 ( http://www.cyanogen.com ) was found to be generally superior .",
    "maximdl / ccd was used to control the camera and manipulate fits data .",
    "since all three of these products are ascom compliant , scripts may be prepared that utilize functions from each in order to carry out observations or analysis .",
    "a variety of languages may be used to prepare such scripts , but visual basic script was selected as the pvs language since it is relatively easy to learn and is an integrated feature of microsoft windows .",
    "scripts may be prepared as plain text documents in notepad and executed with microsoft internet explorer or from within the gui of acp .",
    "the data taking procedure was managed by a master script that incorporated elements from all three software components .",
    "acp was used to send movement commands to the telescope , calculate topocentric coordinates for objects based on usno calibrated utc time and the telescope latitude , longitude , and elevation .",
    "acp also handles issues related to time , such as julian date calculations .",
    "pinpoint created full world coordinate system ( wcs , calabretta & greisn 2000 ) astrometric solutions for ccd data images based on best guess center - of - frame coordinates from acp and a cdrom version of the usnosa2.0 star catalog .",
    "these fits had typical residuals of less than a pixel , and were utilized to update the exact pointing of the telescope in near real time .",
    "once the telescope was positioned close to a desired set of coordinates by acp , an image was taken , the exact pointing was calculated by pinpoint , and then the telescope was moved to compensate for the error ( up to a several arcminutes ) in the initial pointing .",
    "this entire process of point - image - solve - repoint takes approximately 20 seconds when a 3x3 binned image is used for the test pointing and the process is executed on a computer with an 800mhz celeron cpu . on this same computer ,",
    "pinpoint is able to solve a full resolution 1530 by 1020 image in @xmath25 seconds .",
    "the ccd camera itself was controlled through the program maximdl / ccd .",
    "this program sends commands to the camera and writes out standard 16-bit fits files with headers containing the usual information , as well as the wcs astrometric structures prepared by pinpoint .",
    "maximdl / ccd also controls the autoguiding by downloading images of a bright ( @xmath26 ) star placed on the secondary ccd chip , located adjacent to the main chip , and sends small positioning corrections directly to the telescope mount at rates of up to a few times per second .",
    "these corrections were adequate to alleviate most of the periodic error in the right ascension gear of the telescope .",
    "the coordinates of guide stars were provided in the pvs scripts and with the known offset from the center of the main ccd to the center of the guide ccd , acp and pinpoint were used to place the guide star in the center of the guide ccd . at the beginning of the night",
    "the script incorporated a guider calibration , whereby the exact alignment of the ccd pixels with the directions of movement of the telescope , and the speeds of those movements , are determined .",
    "as long as the camera was not removed from the telescope , this calibration was adequate for the night with small adjustments as a function of declination being automatically calculated by maximdl / ccd .",
    "lastly , attempts were made to use maximdl , in conjunction with acp , to automatically estimate and control focus values .",
    "this was done by taking a series of 8 exposures of a bright star and attempting to minimize the stellar fwhm while acp slowly changes focus in steps of 0.005 cm . in practice ,",
    "the large stellar fwhm and highly variable seeing made reliable focus determination very difficult . while the pvs system was being developed ,",
    "a wide range of ambient temperatures were encountered , but the air temperatures during the time when the variable star data was taken remained fairly constant .",
    "the air temperature outside of the dome typically fell by @xmath27c during the night , resulting in a focus change of @xmath28 .",
    "this rate was calculated during very stable observing conditions . on a more typical night , the focus values were found to be repeatable at the + /-0.005 cm level , meaning adjustments were only practical when large changes in the outside temperature were encountered .",
    "after much experimentation , it was found that it was generally most efficient to focus once per night , at about 3 hours after sunset , using acp and maximdl to automatically estimate the best nightly focus value .",
    "the pvs data was taken from a dome located on top of peyton hall , princeton university , princeton , new jersey .",
    "this suburban locale provided less than ideal observing conditions , but conditions typical of those endured by many amateur astronomers .",
    "although the sky was seldom , if ever , photometric , and seeing averaged approximately @xmath29 , such conditions may still produce accurate differential photometry .",
    "the most significant limitations to the observations were sky brightness and poor seeing .",
    "since the sky above princeton is light polluted , observations were taken in the bessel i band .",
    "this bandpass is red enough to be free from much of the light produced by nearby academic buildings and major metropolitan centers as well as much of the light from the moon and falls on an area of high ccd efficiency .",
    "sky brightness in i band is related to atmospheric glow rather than man made light pollution . in i band ,",
    "the sky brightness above the pvs observing sites was found to average 17.7 mag / arcsecond@xmath30 .",
    "teare ( 2000 ) compiled sky brightness for a number of sites . for comparison , the measured brightness at mt.wilson , california , located above the los angeles basin and its millions of inhabitants , is reported to be 18.8mag / arcsecond@xmath30 in the direction of the city .",
    "the sky brightness at ctio , chile , is reported at 19.9 mag / arcsecond@xmath30 in i band .",
    "the average i band sky brightness for princeton , mt.wilson , and ctio are found to be more similar than the average sky brightness in other bands , indicating that the i band sky is less dependent on man made light pollution than other bands .",
    "the princeton site is brighter in i band than mt.wilson probably as a result of the differences in altitude and atmospheric moisture between the two sites .",
    "figure 1 presents a histogram of sky brightness at the pvs site over a month of observations . with exposure durations reasonable for a survey ( up to a few minutes in length ) , the limiting magnitude with the pvs 12  telescope at peyton hall",
    "was found to be approximately 16 in i band .",
    "the atmospheric conditions in princeton were also observed and found to be notably poor . as a result of a combination of dome seeing and atmospheric turbulence , compounded by guiding errors ,",
    "the image fwhm was found to routinely be greater than @xmath31 .",
    "figure 2 presents a histogram of image fwhm values during a month of pvs observations .",
    "scintillation effects were severe , and caused large amplitude ( up to @xmath32 ) variations in image fwhm on frequency scales up to the 5hz .",
    "at least a portion of the seeing effects were attributable to heat rising up into and around the telescope dome from peyton hall below , but similarly bad seeing conditions are reported from other observatories in the area .",
    "as an example , it was found that seeing was often @xmath33 worse than average on the coldest nights , when the heating system of peyton hall was activated . to this end , great care was taken to ensure that the dome was adequately ventilated and temperature equalized with the outside . while the use of large fans to helped to improve the results obtained during the first hour of observations , the average seeing values achieved during the middle of the observing night were found to be unaffected by efforts to increase the efficiency of temperature equalization in the dome .",
    "the performance of the pvs system as tested in princeton is limited by poor conditions , and thus , in a better climate the capabilities of this instrument might be considerably extended .      with the objective of monitoring several hundred stars , an area of the sky",
    "was chosen near the galactic equator , in the constellation auriga , which would be visible for many hours during the period of the pvs observations .",
    "sections of sky near the milky way should in theory yield the highest number of stars per image , but any area of the sky could , in principle , be studied . a strip of 5 pointings , amounting to a total field of view of @xmath34 , was selected near the intersection of the galactic plane and the ecliptic .",
    "one of these pointings contained the open star cluster ngc 1912 .",
    "this rich cluster , with @xmath35 members , has an hr diagram from the observations of subramaniam & sagar ( 1999 ) , which indicates that it may contain lower instability strip variable stars at magnitudes accessible to the pvs instrument . a nearby open cluster of similar age and metallicity , ngc 2516 ,",
    "was studied by zerbi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and was found to have several short period intrinsic variable stars .",
    "the other four fields , all within a few tens of arcminutes , were picked to be fields with many stars from digitized sky survey plates .",
    "eyer & blake ( 2001 ) analyzed the variable star catalog produced by asas and found that the histogram of periods below 50 days peaked at periods a bit longer than 1d . as a result , it was not critical that the pvs data be time sampled at rates of more than two or three times per hour .",
    "for example , 15 data points per night over several nights would yield frequency sampling perfectly adequate for accurate determinations of the periods of many intrinsic ( cepheid , rr lyrae , dwarf cepheid , gamma doradus ) and extrinsic ( contact binaries , eclipsing binaries ) variable stars .    based on the conditions in princeton ,",
    "each of the five fields observed by pvs was allotted 240 seconds per observation .",
    "this amounts to 150 seconds of integration , 50 seconds for image read out , and 40 seconds for overhead associated with astrometric analysis and pointing .",
    "the 150 seconds for integration time was found to balance the faint limit imposed by sky brightness and the saturation of bright ( @xmath36 ) stars .",
    "the telescope was parked at the end of the evening at a prescribed altitude and azimuth so that the next night , with accurate local time and telescope latitude and longitude , a reasonable estimate could be made of initial telescope right ascension and declination .",
    "the night s initial alignment of the telescope with a bright star was therefore automated .",
    "after the power was turned on , a script wasexecuted and the remainder of the night s observations were completed robotically .",
    "images of the five fields were taken in series for a prescribed number of hours .",
    "for example , with five fields to be observed , the telescope system would automatically cycle between the fields in the pattern a , b , c , d , e , a , b ... until morning twilight is reached .",
    "this strategy resulted in up to 20 images of each field per night .",
    "the images were not intentionally dithered .",
    "instead it was intended that each each exposure of a given field place the stars near the same pixels .",
    "a master script initialized the camera , began the camera cool down , executed the initial telescope alignment , moved the telescope with high accuracy to pre - determined coordinates , began guiding , and gathered data exposures . unfortunately , this script did not include dome automation for the results presented here .",
    "the cost of automating the pre - existing dome at peyton hall was prohibitive , so the dome was moved by hand every hour or so .",
    "there are several commercially available robotic dome systems that utilize ascom compliant software , and as a result , dome control may be integrated seamlessly into pvs scripts in the future .",
    "sets of five dark frames were taken each night and used during data reduction to subtract both the dark current and bias from the data images .",
    "sets of 10 flat field exposures were taken from the evening sky following sunset and from an evenly illuminated flat screen inside the dome and were used to compensate for pixel to pixel variations in system light sensitivity .",
    "exposure times for the flat fields were set so that the ccd chip was filled to approximately half of full well capacity .",
    "experience with both sky and dome flat fields showed that the increased flexibility of taking flats inside the dome , as opposed to off of the twilight sky , made this method advantageous .",
    "while the sky flats were taken , it was the dome flats which were later utilized for the image reduction since they were found to be more repeatable and could always be produced , even if weather limited observations to only a small number of hours during the middle of the night .",
    "a test was done to determine the quality of the dome flats , as compared to the sky flats , by reducing and photometering a small image section time series with both types of flats .",
    "the differences in the flat fields was found to have a negligible effect on the resulting photometry . the contribution from the flat fields to the final photometric errors",
    "was estimated to be @xmath37 .      as a result of the limiting magnitude at the pvs test site ,",
    "the data images were not considered crowded .",
    "typically , average star densities on the ccd frames were on the order of 3,000 pixels per star .",
    "in this regime , a number of different photometry techniques are applicable ( alard 2000 , alard & lupton 1998 ) . though simple aperture photometry could be utilized ,",
    "the technique of differential image analysis was applied in order to gain experience with this method for the time when a better observing site might produce ccd images sufficiently dense to warrant this advanced treatment of the data .",
    "this method has several other advantages , including high accuracy , no need for identification of individual comparison stars to produce differential magnitudes , and an ability to deal with the highly variable psfs found in the pvs data .",
    "image subtraction has been shown by wozniak ( 2000 ) to produce photon noise limited photometry and thus could be expected to yield the best possible results for the pvs data .",
    "data reduction tasks such as flat fielding , dark subtraction , and cosmic ray removal were carried out within the interactive data language ( idl ) environment .",
    "there are numerous publicly available idl codes to manage fits file i / o ( http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html ) as well as a wide variety of mathematical and image analysis routines .",
    "each night s flat fields were read into an image cube , individually normalized by dividing by the sigma - clipped image mean , and then the normalized images were averaged , with sigma clipping , to produce a robust nightly flat field . while there were enough counts in the flat fields to limit the statistical noise from the flat to much less than the statistical noise from the sky background in the images , systematic effects were visible in the flat fields as subtle structural changes between images .",
    "fortunately , star centroids remained quite close to the same pixels throughout each night , so large scale , high amplitude gradients and inconsistencies in the flat fields were effectively rendered null for differential photometry .",
    "the dark frames were also read into a data cube and averaged , in order to help eliminate cosmic ray hits , and a nightly dark frame is created .",
    "the dark current of the ccd camera is a function of chip temperature , so it is important to prepare a separate dark frame for each night s observations .",
    "similarly , changes in the optical surfaces and focus require that a separate flat field be prepared for each night .",
    "the dark frame was subtracted from the image frame and the result divided by the flat field .",
    "finally , cosmic ray hits were removed from the data images .",
    "there are several available idl codes to do this , but lacosmic ( van dokkum 2001 ) was found to be most effective .",
    "new fits files with with the reduced data and full header , including wcs information , were written .",
    "a file called @xmath38 and containing the image names , julian date times of observations , and seeing values was also written out to be later referenced during the photometry .",
    "the seeing , or image fwhm , was calculated by fitting a simple gaussian to the profiles of isolated stars .",
    "the reduced image fits files and the @xmath38 file were then used with the image subtraction code to produce photometric data .",
    "the image subtraction algorithms were implemented with the isis2.1 package prepared by christophe alard ( http://www.iap.fr/users/alard/package.html ) .",
    "the first step in the analysis was the sub - pixel image alignment , which is required prior to image convolution . since the ccd camera was occasionally removed and re - attached to the telescope , it was necessary to use the 2nd degree image interpolation option so that translations , as well as small rotations , could be corrected for .",
    "the image to which all others were aligned , called reference in the isis configuration file , was chosen to be the image with the best seeing .",
    "it was important that this fiducial image be of high quality so that the alignment would be sufficiently accurate .",
    "isis created a file called @xmath39 which tabulates the average residuals for each alignment with which the sub - pixel residuals were verified .",
    "any image that failed to align to the reference image would be flagged in the log file and would therefore be removed from list of data images to be analyzed . once the images were well aligned , a new reference image of high signal to noise was created .",
    "to do this the 10 best images were combined using the @xmath40 procedure",
    ". the 2nd degree spatial kernel variation option along with 1st degree background variation fitting were used in order to help compensate for the visually obvious variations in psf and background across the frames .",
    "the images were not sub - divided prior to analysis as was done by some users of the image subtraction method .",
    "the reference image was convolved to match the psf within each data image and then the two were subtracted to determine differences in flux .",
    "the subtraction was carried out by the @xmath41 script and produced subtracted images that were nearly devoid of stars .",
    "the entire process is computationally intensive and may take several hours , depending on the number of data images .",
    "using the isis package on a linux pc , the production of fluxes from approximately 100 images required just less than 1 hour of computational time on a 1.0ghz pentium iii work station with 1 gb of ram .",
    "the errors in the subtraction photometry were found to be small and well - behaved .",
    "strictly speaking , variance in the subtracted images should be the sum of the poisson deviations in the reference and data images . in practice",
    ", it was found that bright but not saturated stars often have convolution residuals several times those expected from photon noise .",
    "this effect , due to seeing variations , is explained by alard and lupton ( 1998 ) .",
    "the image subtraction methods were found to work extremely well for the pvs data .",
    "figure 3 shows the histogram of the residuals of a subtracted image normalized by the poisson errors expected from the reference and data image .",
    "this figure demonstrates that there was very little residual starlight in the subtracted images .",
    "the idealized distribution of the residuals , n[0,1 ] , is overplotted with the dashed line .",
    "the actual residuals fall into a n[0.005,0.98 ] distribution , indicating that the image subtraction techniques worked quite well and that accuracies at the limit of the sky noise should be achieved .    in order to detect variability , the subtracted images , normalized by the gain adjusted sums of the poisson deviations of the reference and data images ,",
    "were squared and coadded .",
    "the resulting variance image made variable objects easily identifiable both visually and by a simple detection script .",
    "variable sources , which have variance well above that expected from just photon noise , were photometered with basic aperture photometry on the individual subtracted images in order to determine how stellar flux changed with time .",
    "false detections were found to occur for bright and nearly saturated stars as well as for stars near the edges of the frames where drift in the image centroid during a night may cause stars to come in and out of the field of view .",
    "the errant bright star detections , in this case for stars brighter than about 8th magnitude , were generally disregarded . in practice",
    ", this amounted to very few stars , and considering that many of the stars this bright would have been previously studied by other programs , the loss is considered negligible .",
    "the photometric errors were found to be quite small for all stars .",
    "figure 4 shows average errors in magnitudes for a star of a given i band magnitude .",
    "overplotted on these points is the line indicating the magnitude errors from sky noise that would be expected in the aperture photometry of a subtracted image with average seeing and sky brightness . for stars fainter than approximately @xmath42 ,",
    "the photometric accuracy was nearly sky limited .",
    "the contribution from scintillation noise was calculated according to the formula of young ( 1974 ) and was found to be @xmath43mag for 150s integrations and the low elevation of the pvs site .",
    "a master list of stars for each frame was prepared from the averaged reference image using the daophot find routine with detection thresholds determined by poisson statistics , as outlined in appendix b of the daophot ii manual .",
    "the fluxes , as measured from the subtracted images of all of the stars in the master list , were searched for periodic signals using the lomb periodogram algorithm described by lomb ( 1976 ) .",
    "this algorithm produces a probability statistic that the fluctuations of a given star are due to noise .",
    "a list of the 10 most likely variables in each field was prepared so that these stars could be inspected visually .",
    "fluxes were converted to magnitudes by attempting to find stars of known i band magnitude in each frame in order to set a frame zero point .",
    "the comparison stars for each frame were chosen by searching the simbad database ( http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/sim-fid.pl ) for stars with known spectral type and magnitude .",
    "a total of 5 stars with @xmath44 and spectral type a to f were found within the observed fields and used to set the magnitude zero points . since here",
    "the absolute zero points of the stellar magnitudes are less important than the differential magnitudes and cataloged stars with accurate i band magnitudes were difficult to find , only these simple steps were taken to tie the pvs magnitudes to the standard magnitude scale .",
    "this process does introduce errors in the zero point magnitudes of all the stars , but it in no way affects the differential photometry . since change in flux is being studied here , rather than average flux , these errors are considered acceptable .",
    "observations totaling about 30 hours were carried out during the month of 2001 december .",
    "data was taken under a variety of conditions , including partial cloud , since differential magnitudes are known to be relatively robust to poor observational conditions . even during the best hours of atmospheric transparency and stability ,",
    "the conditions were found to be relatively poor .",
    "seeing and sky brightness combined to produce a limiting magnitude , at which expected photometric errors due to sky noise just exceed @xmath45 , of approximately 15.5 in i - band .",
    "the poor conditions also caused occasional high amplitude scintillation affects that , when combined with residual mechanical guiding errors , caused jumps in the guide star centroid that were unrecoverable by the autoguider .",
    "as a result , approximately 10% of data images were smeared and not useful .",
    "these images were rejected by the astrometric fitting routines .",
    "the total number of stars observed was approximately 3,000 over the five fields , with approximately 1,000 of these stars being bright enough to have s / n such that photometric errors are @xmath6 . with a baseline of 30 days and data sampled at a incidence of 3 measurements per hour over portions of 10 separate nights",
    ", many types of variable stars would be detected when enough stars are measured with sufficient accuracy .",
    "experience with asas has shown that the rate of short period eclipsing binaries is high enough that several may have been expected in the pvs fields . as a result of sky brightness and seeing , the data images are unfortunately not deep enough or of high enough signal to noise to produce these results .",
    "further more , many of the variables discovered by asas ( @xmath1 of observed stars ) vary on time scales longer than these observations , so they were not detected with pvs . as a result of these factors ,",
    "only one new variable star could be positively identified at the several sigma level .",
    "this new variable , previously designated @xmath46 , is a 9.5 magnitude o or b type star in the constellation auriga , with j2000 coordinates @xmath47 the period was found to be 0.81d and the amplitude 0.34 mag .",
    "the phased light curve is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the design of a robotic photometric telescope , built out of commercially available and inexpensive components , is outlined .",
    "results from one month of observations with the pvs instrument are presented , and it is demonstrated that the instrument produces high quality photometric results , even from a location with extremely bad atmospheric conditions . the discovery of a new short period variable star is presented . though the system performed as well as could be expected given the atmospheric conditions at the princeton , new jersey , site , the full potential of the pvs design can not be determined until it is tested at a site with better conditions . a decrease in sky brightness by 1 magnitude , an improvement of mean seeing to 3  , and a higher percentage of clear nights would result in a tremendous increase in the number of variable stars that could be discovered by the pvs system .",
    "many suitable sites exists , including ones , such as mt.wilson , within easy reach of major metropolitan areas of the american south west .",
    "instrumental and computational techniques are developed and tested here so that a system could be efficiently and economically installed and operated at a better site .",
    "the author would like to thank bohdan paczyski for his tireless support , guidance , encouragement , and patience while this research was carried out , william golden for his generous support of this work , and bruce draine for many hours of assistance and discussions .",
    "thanks also to bob denny , the developer of the ascom standard .",
