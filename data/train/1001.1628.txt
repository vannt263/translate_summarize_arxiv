    "in this situation , the existence of the inconsistency should be confirmed by new experiments .",
    "the past bnl e821 experiment @xcite was based on the use of electrostatic focusing at the `` magic '' beam momentum @xmath5 .",

    "its increasing prolongs the lab lifetime of muons . as a result",
    ", a measurement of muon _ g_-2 at the level of 0.03 ppm appears feasible @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop the ideas by farley .",
    "we adopt his propositions to measure the average magnetic field with polarized proton beams and to use a ring with a noncontinuous field for keeping the independence of the spin rotation frequency from the particle momentum .",
    "we also investigate the most interesting case when the beam energy can be arbitrary .",
    "however , we propose to perform the high - precision muon _",
    "g_-2 experiment on an ordinary storage ring with a nonuniform field created by superconducting magnets .",
    "we prove that the independence of the spin rotation frequency from the particle momentum can be reached not only in a continuous uniform magnetic field @xcite and a noncontinuous and locally uniform one @xcite but also in a usual storage ring with a noncontinuous and nonuniform magnetic field . in the last case , the total length of straight sections of the ring should be appropriate .",
    "we also analyze possibilities to avoid the betatron resonance @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the horizontal tune ) and consider corrections to the _ g_-2 frequency .",
    "the system of units @xmath10 is used .",

    "the spin coherence is kept when @xmath21 for a storage ring with a noncontinuous field , the quantity @xmath17 should be averaged .",
    "this condition defines a spin - isochronous ring , i.e. , the spin precession frequency is independent of the momentum at the first order .    condition ( [ main ] ) can be satisfied for ordinary storage rings with magnets creating nonuniform field ( fig .",
    "beam direction is normal to the magnet faces and there is not edge focusing .",
    "the number of bending sections can be different .",
    "if the field created by the magnets is given by @xmath22 , the field index and betatron tunes into bending sections are equal to @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the ring radius .",
    "average angular frequency of spin precession is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a half of the total length of the straight sections ( fig .",
    "the muon anomaly is equal to @xmath28 where the fundamental constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are measured with a high precision .",
    "the magnetic field is the same for muons and protons when they move on the same trajectory . in this case ,",
    "their momenta coincide .",
    "when the momentum increases ( @xmath31 ) , the magnetic field becomes weaker , but the time of flight in the magnetic field becomes longer .",
    "the spin precession is defined by @xmath32    condition ( [ main ] ) leads to @xmath33 and is satisfied when @xmath34 where @xmath25 corresponds to @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in this case @xmath37 and the following relation takes place : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the orbit circumference . as a result ,",
    "the momentum compaction factor is @xmath40 since @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the revolution period , the definition of @xmath43 can be brought to the usual form : @xmath44 evidently , the spin - isochronous ring ( @xmath45 ) is not isochronous in the usual sense , i.e. , the beam revolution frequency depends on the momentum .",
    "( [ eql ] ) is not exact because it does not include a correction for the fringe field .",
    "this field also contributes to the average field , but it is independent of @xmath46 . the fringe field is important only near the magnet edges and causes the correction to @xmath47 of order of the ratio of the magnet gap to the ring radius ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this correction depends on the number of the straight sections and can be analytically and numerically calculated because the magnet field is known with a needed accuracy .",
    "evidently , the correction to the local value of @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 the corrected values of @xmath47 also coincide for muons and protons because particles with equal momenta move in the same field .",
    "two other corrections to the angular velocity of spin precession caused by the longitudinal magnetic field and the vertical betatron oscillations are considered in section iv .",
    "while these corrections are different for the muons and protons , they are rather small ( @xmath51 ppm ) .    the real value of the length of the straight section , @xmath27 , can slightly differ from @xmath47 . in the general case , @xmath52 the difference between the real and nominal values of the average angular frequency of spin rotation",

    "( [ dof ] ) does not depend explicitly on @xmath54 . the first term in the r.h.s",

    ", one can make measurements with proton beams .",
    "three measurements with different values of @xmath56 are sufficient .",
    "the average proton momentum can be kept with radio frequency ( rf ) cavities put into straight sections of the ring .",
    "the longitudinal electric field in the cavities does not influence the spin dynamics .",
    "condition ( [ main ] ) leading to eq .",
    "( [ mcf ] ) should not be exactly satisfied . it can be shown that the relation @xmath45 leads to the betatron resonance @xmath8 which results in zeroth frequency of horizontal coherent betatron oscillation ( cbo ) of the beam as a whole and a loss of the beam @xcite .",
    "therefore , the total length of the straight sections should slightly differ from @xmath47 so that the cbo tune would be small but nonzero : @xmath57    typically , in a weak focusing ring @xmath58 .",
    "( [ mcfg ] ) results in @xmath59 .",
    "we expect that the cbo tune about @xmath60 is sufficient to keep the beam . in this case",
    ", the appropriate choice of the total length of straight sections @xmath61 reduces the dependence of the spin rotation frequency on the beam momentum by two orders of magnitude . as a result , the use of proton beams for measuring the average magnetic field becomes quite possible .",
    "experimental details depend on the beam momentum . if it is higher than in the completed experiment ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the muon lifetime in the laboratory frame increases and the rf cavities may be helpful not only for protons but also for muons to keep the spin coherence .",
    "otherwise , the use of low muon momentum ( @xmath62 gev/@xmath63 ) and much higher statistics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) may even be more preferable . in this case , the rf cavities are unnecessary for muons .",
    "the problem of taking into account corrections to the _ g_-2 frequency is very important .",
    "one of the main problems is an influence of the radial and vertical betatron oscillations on the average vertical magnetic field .",
    "we can consider the case when the velocity of unperturbed motion , @xmath64 , coincides with the absolute value of the velocity of perturbed motion .",
    "for the latter motion , the average longitudinal component of the velocity is approximately equal to @xmath65    it can be shown that the average magnetic field for the perturbed motion , @xmath66 , slightly differs from that for the unperturbed motion , @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by eq .",
    "( [ cbot ] ) .",
    "approximately , @xmath70    when @xmath71 , the correction to the average vertical magnetic field for the betatron oscillations is rather small and may be even negligible .",
    "a noncontinuous vertical magnetic field leads to a longitudinal magnetic field on the edges of the magnets .",
    "possibly , the latter field is a reason of the main correction to the _ g_-2 frequency .",
    "it was asserted in ref .",
    "@xcite that this field causes `` the need to know @xmath72 for the muons to a precision of 10 ppb '' .",
    "however , we should take into account that the longitudinal magnetic field can not be neglected only on small segments of the beam trajectory near edges of magnets . as a result ,",
    "the above estimate of precision should be decreased by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the correction for the longitudinal magnetic field can be carefully examined . as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the longitudinal magnetic field acting on a particle oscillates .",
    "when the vertical velocity oscillation ( pitch ) is given by @xmath75 , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the trajectory length and @xmath78 is the cyclotron frequency into bending sections .",
    "evidently , @xmath79 .    to estimate the correction , we can suppose that @xmath80 .",
    "the length of the considered trajectory segment at the magnet edge is @xmath81 .",
    "calculations can be simplified if we present the angular velocity of the spin precession in the form @xmath82 and suppose that @xmath83 .",
    "this is nothing but an estimate because the vertical magnetic field strongly varies within the considered trajectory segment .    to calculate the correction",
    ", we can use the results presented in ref .",

    "( [ eqstz ] ) and ( [ eqsto ] ) , respectively .",
    "( [ eqstc ] ) defines only the correction for one segment of the beam trajectory . to obtain the total correction",
    ", we should take into account the maxwell equation @xmath87 . if the _",
    "g_-2 precession did not take place , the total effect of the longitudinal magnetic field would vanish .",
    "however , the total correction is nonzero owing to a non - commutativity of rotations and is provided by the spin component orthogonal to the beam polarization at the beginning of a beam turn .",
    "therefore , the total correction , @xmath88 , can be obtained with the multiplication of @xmath89 by the additional factor : @xmath90    the quantity @xmath81 is usually of the order of the magnet gap . if we substitute the parameters of the bnl e821 experiment into eqs .",
    "( [ eqstc]),([eqstf ] ) , we obtain @xmath91 ppm for both muons and protons .    to measure the total correction with an absolute accuracy of 0.01 ppm , one should determine the magnetic field parameters with a relative accuracy of @xmath92 .",
    "since the field of magnets is well known , extra measurements may be unnecessary . when the muon beam momentum is significantly decreased as compared with the bnl e821 experiment ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the correction for the muons becomes an order of magnitude less . for low - momentum beams , one can suppress the vertical betatron oscillations and additionally reduce the corrections for both the muons and protons .",
    "in the proposed experiment , the correction for the vertical betatron oscillations ( pitch correction ) @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) should also be taken into account .",
    "known formulas @xcite give the order of magnitude of this correction ( @xmath93 ppm ) .",
    "the pitch correction can also be reduced with a suppression of the vertical betatron oscillations for low - momentum beams .",
    "specific calculations should allow for a noncontinuity and a nonuniformity of the magnetic field .    in any case",
    ", all the corrections can be determined with an accuracy of 0.01 ppm or even better .",
    "the stabilization and monitoring the magnetic field is an important and rather difficult problem . to stabilize the magnetic field in a few minutes needed for measuring the proton spin precession frequency ,",
    "superconducting magnets can be used .",
    "it is more difficult to avoid a change of the magnetic field when switching from muon to proton storage .",
    "however , such a change can be properly determined .",
    "the average magnetic field can be calculated if the beam momentum and the average radius or frequency of the beam orbit are known .",
    "a change of the average magnetic field brings a corresponding change of the average radius and frequency of the beam orbit .",
    "therefore , measuring the frequencies @xcite or positions of the muon and proton beam orbits allows to determine the shift of the average magnetic field .",
    "the average proton momentum is defined by the rf cavities .",
    "in addition to the muon measurements , proton beams before and/or after muon runs can be used .",
    "the use of these methods should provide a determination of the shift of the average magnetic field with a relative accuracy of 0.1 ppm or even better . as a result",
    ", the muon and proton measurements can be related with a high precision .",
    "the methods of measurement of the _ g_-2 precession in the proposed experiment and the farley s one are very similar .",
    "the important advantage of a noncontinuous nonuniform ring versus a noncontinuous uniform one is a possibility to avoid much shimming needed for creating the uniform magnetic field .",
    "shimming is even more difficult for the noncontinuous uniform ring than for a continuous uniform one because of the fringe field .",
    "we expect that the proposed experiment can be carried out with one of existing rings .",
    "the systematical errors considered above do not prevent to measure the muon _",
    "g_-2 factor with a high precision .",
    "the sum of all systematical errors considered in the manuscript causes less systematic uncertainty than that in the planned e969 experiment @xcite .",
    "while there are many other systematical errors , we expect that the precision of the proposed experiment may be approximately the same or better than that of the planned e969 experiment .",
    "a more detailed theoretical analysis should be based on the matrix method .",
    "the use of the matrix method is necessary for further theoretical investigations .",
    "however , any theoretical analysis is not sufficient to calculate the spin dynamics in specific _ g_-2 rings with a needed accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , necessary calculations can be carried out with spin tracking .",
    "since the theoretical predictions and the experimental data do not agree , performing new experiments based on different ring lattices is necessary .",
    "such experiments will be very important even if they will not provide better precision as compared with the usual _",
