    "the non - perturbative power corrections in this expression are proportional to the strange - quark mass , the quark condensate , and higher - dimensional condensates . because all contributions of dimension less than six vanish in the chiral limit , the power corrections are numerically small ; using standard values of the qcd parameters , one finds @xmath12 .",
    "this , together with the fact that the perturbation series is known to third order , make @xmath9 a good observable to measure @xmath8 .",

    "this uncertainty can be estimated by considering some approximate resummations of the perturbation series ( starting at order @xmath20 ) and comparing them to the fixed - order calculation .",
    "the resummation procedure of le  diberder and pich @xcite resums certain `` large-@xmath21 '' terms to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "recently , another class of terms , the so - called renormalon chains @xcite , have been investigated .",
    "these are the terms of order @xmath22 in the perturbation series for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the first coefficient of the qcd @xmath7-function .",
    "the resummation of such terms in the case of @xmath9 has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpert ] , we show the corresponding theoretical predictions for @xmath23 as a function of @xmath25 . we conclude that @xmath26 is a reasonable estimate of the truncation error .",
    "this leads to @xmath27 for the sake of completeness , we have translated our result into a value of @xmath8 at the mass of the @xmath28 boson .",
    "the analysis just described provides one of the best determination of the qcd coupling constant in the low - energy region .",
    "the result ( [ asval ] ) is included in fig .  [ fig : as_compile ] , which shows a collection of measurements of @xmath8 performed at different energy scales @xcite .",
    "besides @xmath0 decays , low - energy ( @xmath2910  gev ) measurements come from deep - inelastic scattering and @xmath30 spectroscopy and decays . at higher energies ( @xmath31130  gev ) , the most reliable determinations of @xmath8 come from measurements of the total cross section , jet rates and event shapes in @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 collisions .",
    "taken all together , these measurements provide clear evidence for the `` running '' of the effective coupling constant @xmath2 , which in qcd is predicted to decrease with the momentum transfer .",
    "this property of `` asymptotic freedom '' @xcite is one of the key predictions of qcd .",
    "formally , it is expressed by the fact that the @xmath7-function is positive , where @xmath35 \\ , , \\nonumber\\\\     \\beta(\\alpha_s ) & = & \\beta_0\\,{\\alpha_s\\over 4\\pi }      + \\beta_1\\,\\bigg ( { \\alpha_s\\over 4\\pi } \\bigg)^2      + \\beta_2\\,\\bigg ( { \\alpha_s\\over 4\\pi } \\bigg)^3 + \\dots \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the first three expansion coefficients of the @xmath7-function , evaluated for @xmath39 light quark flavours .

    "the value of @xmath40 is specific to the @xmath41 renormalization scheme . )",
    "tempboxa = tempboxa > 5 in    a test of the running of @xmath8 by combining measurements performed in many experiments operating at different energy scales has the disadvantage of involving different experimental systematic errors , as well as different levels of sophistication of the theoretical calculations .",
    "therefore , it is an appealing idea to measure the scale dependence of the coupling constant in a single experiment .",
    "this can be done in high - energy experiments at @xmath33 and @xmath34 colliders , where a large range of @xmath42 values can be probed simultaneously @xcite .",
    "however , so far the precision obtained in these measurements is rather low . in this talk",
    ", we propose a high - precision test of the running of @xmath8 in the low - energy region ( @xmath3 ) , using data obtained in a single experiment @xcite . the value of @xmath8 changes by about a factor  2 in this energy range , which is equivalent to the variation between 5 and 100  gev .",
    "we shall consider the @xmath0 decay rate into hadrons of invariant mass squared smaller than @xmath43 , normalized to the leptonic decay rate : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the inclusive hadronic spectrum , which has been measured by the cleo and aleph collaborations @xcite . to obtain @xmath45 ,",

    ", we use the estimate @xmath63 @xcite obtained using the methods of ref .  @xcite . as in the case of @xmath9 ,",
    "the truncation of the perturbation series will turn out to be the main theoretical uncertainty in our analysis .",
    "we estimate the importance of the unknown higher - order contributions ( of order @xmath64 and higher ) by resumming the renormalon - chain contributions to all orders in perturbation theory , using the results of ref .",
    "we shall compare fixed - order perturbation theory with this resummation and take the difference as an estimate of the perturbative uncertainty .",
    "this estimate of the truncation error is more conservative than that obtained by dropping the last term in the series in ( [ rpert ] ) .",
    "tempboxa = tempboxa > 5 in    the power corrections in ( [ rs0ope ] ) are given by @xmath65 note that , as a simple consequence of the representation ( [ rs0int ] ) , no inverse powers of @xmath43 appear in this expression @xcite .",
    "this is true as long as the coefficients of the power corrections to the correlation function @xmath55 do not contain logarithms of @xmath50 . as a result",
    ", the ope converges well down to low scales @xmath43 .",
    "for instance , we find @xmath66 at @xmath67 , and @xmath68 at @xmath69  gev@xmath70 .",
    "the break - down of the ope ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : duality ] below ) will thus not be driven by a blow - up of the series of power corrections .",
    "another important feature of ( [ rpower ] ) is that the terms involving the vacuum condensates are independent of @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the uncertainties in the values of the condensates do not affect the @xmath43 dependence of @xmath51 , which will be used to study the running of @xmath57 .    from the measurement of the quantity @xmath51 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , we extract @xmath57 as a function of @xmath43 by fitting to the data the theoretical prediction obtained using fixed - order perturbation theory .",
    "the result , including experimental errors only , is represented by the dark band in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] .",
    "theoretical uncertainties arise from the truncation of the perturbation series and from the uncertainty in the values of the nonperturbative parameters .",
    "they affect the overall scale of the @xmath8 values ( by about 810% ) , but have very little effect on the evolution of the coupling constant .",
    "the sum of the experimental and theoretical errors is represented by the light band .",
    "the dashed curve shows the qcd predictions for @xmath57 obtained at three - loop order , normalized to the central value of the data at @xmath67 .",
    "the observed scale dependence of the running coupling constant is in excellent agreement with the qcd prediction .",
    "tempboxa = tempboxa > 5 in    as mentioned above , the main theoretical uncertainty comes from the truncation of the perturbation series .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas2 ] , where the evolution of @xmath57 as a function of @xmath43 is shown separately for fixed - order and resummed perturbation theory .",
    "the curves show the qcd predictions for the running coupling constant obtained at one- and three - loop order , normalized to the data at @xmath67 .",
    "it is seen that higher - order corrections effectively renormalize the overall scale of the @xmath8 values ( i.e.  the @xmath71 parameter ) .",
    "for instance , the value of @xmath8 at @xmath67 changes from 0.33 ( fixed - order ) to 0.31 ( resummed ) .",
    "the difference between the two results for @xmath57 has been used to estimate the truncation error .",
    "tempboxa = tempboxa > 5 in    fig .  [ fig : run ] shows our result combined with the other measurements of @xmath8 collected in fig .",
    "[ fig : as_compile ] . we have replaced the data point at @xmath4 by the band shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] , which extends to much lower values of @xmath42 .",
    "this figure demonstrates nicely the main features of our approach : it extends the range of @xmath8 values accessible to experiments , thus allowing a measurement of the strong coupling constant at scales lower than the lowest ones attainable before .",
    "moreover , it provides a test of the qcd evolution of @xmath8 with higher precision than all other single measurements of the running to date .",
    "an important question which we have to address is to determine the lowest value of @xmath43 for which our analysis can be trusted . in other words , at which point do we expect the ope to break down ? to answer this question , it is important to realize that we are applying the ope in the physical region ( i.e.  the region of time - like momenta ) , where qcd can not be used to calculate correlation functions such as @xmath55 .",
    "the reason why we trust the calculation of @xmath51 is that to perform the contour integral in ( [ rs0int ] ) requires knowledge of the correlation function for large ( complex ) momenta only .",
    "moreover , the integrand vanishes for @xmath72 , where the contour touches the branch cut of @xmath55 ; hence , the main contributions come from regions far away from the singularities , where the ope can be applied .",
    "another way to say this is that in the calculation of @xmath51 we assume quark  hadron duality , which is the hypothesis that qcd can be employed to calculate physical decay rates if they are `` smeared '' over a sufficiently wide energy interval @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "this smearing is provided by the integration over the range @xmath73 in ( [ rs0def ] ) .",
    "the question of how accurate the duality assumption is and for what values of @xmath43 it applies is , however , a phenomenological one . despite of some interesting new ideas @xcite ,",
    "it can not be answered yet from theoretical grounds .    to test the assumption of duality",
    ", we compare the data for the quantity @xmath51 with the theoretical predictions obtained from the ope , using both fixed - order and resummed perturbation theory .",
    "the results are shown by the two curves in the lower portion of fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] . in obtaining these curves ,",
    "we have adjusted the value of @xmath25 so as to fit the data at @xmath67 .",
    "the value of @xmath57 is then obtained from the solution of the renormalization - group equation ( [ rge ] ) .",
    "theoretical uncertainties have little influence on the @xmath43 dependence of @xmath51 . for the perturbative part of the calculation ,",
    "this is apparent from the good agreement of the two theoretical curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , which refer to values of @xmath25 that differ by 9% .",
    "hence , the @xmath43 dependence of @xmath51 is predicted essentially without any free parameters , and the comparison of the data with the theoretical predictions provides a direct test of quark  hadron duality .",
    "we find excellent agreement over the range @xmath74 , indicating that in @xmath0 decays duality holds as soon as the integral over the hadronic mass distribution includes the @xmath75 resonance peak .",
    "this justifies _ a posteriori _ our choice of the energy interval in the previous section .",
    "it is remarkable that , once @xmath43 exceeds the value of 0.7  gev@xmath70 , the onset of duality happens almost instantaneously .",
    "since the @xmath75 meson is such a prominent resonance , this is the best possible scenario that could be expected .",
    "the small oscillation of the experimental band around the theoretical curve , which could be due to some deviations from duality in the region of the @xmath76 resonance , are not significant given the precision of the data . even if such oscillations will be confirmed in further analyses based on more precise data",
    ", they will clearly not put a severe limitation on the applicability of our method .",
    "to quantify the agreement between the data and the qcd prediction for the running coupling constant exhibited in figs .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] and [ fig : alphas2 ] , we extract from the data the @xmath7-function defined in ( [ rge ] ) and compare the result to the prediction of qcd perturbation theory . introducing the variable @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 we approximate the derivative @xmath79 by a ratio of differences , @xmath80 , for a selected set of @xmath43 values chosen such that the differences @xmath81 are large enough to be significant given the errors in the measurement . for @xmath57 in ( [ beta ] ) we take the central value of each interval .",
    "we use the following @xmath43 values : 0.75 , 0.95 , 1.35 , 2.06 , and 3.16  gev@xmath70 , corresponding to four intervals of increasing width @xmath82 , but constant @xmath83 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : betafun ] .",
    "the circles are obtained using fixed - order perturbation theory , while the squares refer to resummed perturbation theory . as expected",
    ", the two methods give very similar results for the running of the coupling constant .",
    "the estimate of the errors includes the theoretical uncertainties , the error due to the choice of finite intervals in @xmath8 , and the experimental errors , which in this case are the dominant ones .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : betafun ] show the qcd @xmath7-function at one- , two- and three - loop order in perturbation theory .",
    "the data provide clear evidence for the running of the coupling constant . moreover",
    ", they prefer a running that is stronger than predicted at one - loop order .",
    "indeed , between the three curves , the best description of the data is provided by the three - loop prediction . performing a fit with the three - loop @xmath7-function , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are kept fixed but",
    "the three - loop coefficient @xmath40 is treated as a parameter , we find @xmath84 using fixed - order perturbation theory , and @xmath85 using resummed perturbation theory .",
    "we believe that such an experimental determination of the @xmath7-function beyond the leading order can at present be done only in @xmath0 decays .",
    "( a high - precision measurement of @xmath86 in the region below the charmonium resonances would provide an alternative place for such a study . ) at higher energies , the value of @xmath8 is too small to distinguish between the three curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : betafun ] ; measurements in the region @xmath87  gev , for instance , correspond to values @xmath88 .",
    "tempboxa = tempboxa > 5 in",
    "we have presented a method to measure the running coupling constant @xmath2 in the low - energy region @xmath3 , using @xmath0-decay data obtained in a single experiment . at @xmath4 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath89 , corresponding to the rather precise value @xmath90 .",
    "our method provides a test of the scale dependence of the coupling constant in a region where this effect is most pronounced .",
    "the theoretical analysis is based on the ope and the assumption of quark  hadron duality .",
    "we have tested this assumption and find that it holds provided the @xmath0 decay rate is integrated over an energy interval large enough to include the @xmath75 resonance peak .",
    "our analysis provides a test of qcd at scales comparable with the lowest ones attainable before ( @xmath91  gev in deep - inelastic scattering ) , and with higher precision than all other single measurements of the running to date .",
