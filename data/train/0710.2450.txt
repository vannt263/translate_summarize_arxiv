    "the puzzle associated with recent cosmic acceleration , triggered by @xmath3 of dark energy or more @xcite is far from being resolved uniquely . in the mean time , cosmologists are being confronted with yet another more intriguing challenge to explain the crossing of the so called phantom divide line @xmath4 , at sufficiently late time of cosmological evolution .",
    "some recent analysis @xcite,@xcite of the presently available observational data are in favour of the value @xmath5 , at present . , @xmath6 being the dark energy equation of state .",
    "there are also a lot of evidence all around @xcite , of a dynamical dark energy equation of state , which has crossed the so called phantom divide line @xmath7 recently , at the value of red - shift parameter @xmath8 . apparently though the problem turns out to be more serious and complicated , but then",
    ", the puzzle of crossing the phantom divide line has also rendered some sort of selection rule .",
    "@xmath9-model , which is known to suffer from the disease of fine tuning ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) can now be ruled out due to the requirement of a dynamic state parameter .",
    "further , if the analysis of vikman @xcite is correct , then it is not possible to cross the phantom divide line in a single minimally coupled scalar field theory , without violating the stability both at the classical @xcite and also at the quantum mechanical levels @xcite , ( though it has recently been inferred @xcite that quantum effects which induce the @xmath10 phase , are stable in the @xmath11 model ) .",
    "thus single minimally coupled scalar field models like quintessence @xmath12 and phantom @xmath13 are to be kept aside .",
    "consequently , we are now left with some what more complicated models .",
    "one of these is a hybrid model , composed of two scalar fields , viz , quintessence and phantom - usually dubbed as quintom model @xcite .",
    "other models like non - minimal scalar tensor theory of gravity @xcite , hessence @xcite and models including higher order curvature invariant terms @xcite also exist in the literature .",
    "+ gauss - bonnet term is yet another candidate which may be pursued for the purpose .",
    "the possibility of crossing the phantom divide line through gauss - bonnet interaction has been explored in some recent works @xcite,@xcite .",
    "but then , these models are even complicated in the sense that either brane - world scenario @xcite or scalar field and matter coupling @xcite are invoked . in this article",
    "the possibility of smooth crossing of the phantom divide line @xmath7 has been expatiated simply by introducing gauss - bonnet - scalar coupling term in the 4-dimensional einstein - hilbert action . + gauss - bonnet term arises naturally as the leading order of the @xmath14 expansion of heterotic superstring theory , where , @xmath14 is the inverse string tension @xcite .",
    "gauss - bonnet term is topologically invariant and thus does not contribute to the field equations in four dimensions .",
    "however , the low energy limit of the string theory gives rise to the dilatonic scalar field which is found to be coupled with various curvature invariant terms @xcite .",
    "the leading quadratic correction gives rise to gauss - bonnet term with a dilatonic coupling @xcite .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to consider gauss - bonnet interaction in four dimension with dilatonic - scalar coupling .",
    "several works with gauss - bonnet - dilatonic coupling are already present in the literature @xcite . in particular , important issues like - late time dominance of dark energy after a scaling matter era and thus alleviating the coincidence problem , crossing the phantom divide line and compatibility with the observed spectrum of cosmic background radiation have also been addressed recently @xcite .",
    "+ in a recent work with gauss - bonnet interaction @xcite , a solution in the form @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the scale factor , and @xmath17 ) has is been found to satisfy the field equations with different forms ( sum of exponentials , sum of inverse exponentials , sum of powers and even quadratic ) of potentials .",
    "solution in a more general form @xmath18 , for einstein s gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field was found in the nineties @xcite and was dubbed as intermediate inflation .",
    "we @xcite , on the other hand , observed that such solution depicts a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion at sufficiently later epoch of cosmic evolution , which asymptotically goes over to de - sitter expansion .",
    "thus , it appeared that such solution may construct viable cosmological models of present interests . under this consequence ,",
    "a comprehensive analysis has been carried out @xcite with such solution in the context of a generalized k - essence model .",
    "it has been observed that it admits scaling solution with a natural exit from it at a later epoch of cosmic evolution , leading to late time acceleration with asymptotic de - sitter expansion .",
    "the corresponding scalar field has also been found to behave as a tracker field @xcite , thus avoiding cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "+ in the present work , we show that gauss - bonnet - dilatonic scalar coupling with einstein s gravity in four dimensions , admits solution in a general form @xmath18 , which is viable of crossing the phantom divide line twice , once from above and the other from below in the recent epoch .",
    "since the crossing is transient , so we may conclude that it does not show any pathological behaviour like big - rip @xcite , at least in the classical level .",
    "we start with the following action containing gauss - bonnet interaction    s = d^4x[+ g(r)-,_^-v()+l_m ] , where , @xmath19 is the gauss - bonnet term which appears in the action with a coupling parameter @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the matter lagrangian . for the spatially flat robertson - walker space - time @xmath22,\\ ] ]",
    "the field equations in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath23 , are    2h+3h^2=-[^2-v()+2(hh+h^3)+(+^2)h^2+p_m]=- ( p_de+p_m ) ,    3h^2=[^2+v()-3h^3+_m ] = ( _ de+ _ m ) , in the units @xmath24 . in our analysis",
    "the gauss - bonnet scalar interaction plays the role of dark energy , for which suffix ( @xmath25 ) has been introduced . thus , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the effective pressure and the energy density generated by the gauss - bonnet - scalar interaction , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the pressure and the energy density corresponding to background matter distribution respectively .",
    "the background matter satisfies the equation of state ,    _",
    "m=_ia^-3(1+w_m ) , where , @xmath30 is a constant and @xmath31 is the state parameter of the background matter . in addition",
    "we have got the @xmath32 variation equation    @xmath33 which is not an independent equation and will not be required in our analysis . in the above , over - dot and dash ( @xmath34 ) stand for differentiations with respect to the proper time @xmath35 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "now , in view of equations ( 2 ) through ( 4 ) , we are required to solve for @xmath36 and @xmath29 , which requires three additional assumptions .",
    "firstly , we consider that the universe is filled with cold dark background matter with equation of state , @xmath37 while the second assumption is the one made previously in @xcite , viz . ,",
    "= , where , @xmath38 is a constant .",
    "this , as indicated in @xcite is physically reasonable , since it implies that the gauss - bonnet coupling parameter @xmath39 , grows in time to contribute at the later epoch of cosmological evolution . in view of the above assumption",
    "the field equations ( 2 ) through ( 4 ) are expressed as ,    2h+3h^2=-[^2-v()+2hh+2h^3]=- p_de ,    3h^2=[^2+v()-h^3+_m]=(_de+_m ) , and ,    _",
    "m=_i a^-3.now , for our third assumption , we start from the ansatz ,    h=,with @xmath40 , which leads to the form of the solution of the scale factor mentioned in the introduction .",
    "thus the complete set of solutions are given by ,    @xmath41 @xmath42 _ de+3p_de= - - ;   _ de+p_de=- ;   @xmath43 @xmath44 above set of solutions ( 10 ) indicates that such a model of the universe admits an early deceleration , but during evolution it starts accelerating since strong energy condition is violated , @xmath45 .",
    "further , the dark energy equation of state also admits the possibility of crossing the @xmath0 line , since , transient violation of the weak energy condition , @xmath46 is seemingly possible .",
    "finally , the equation of state asymptotically touches the @xmath0 line from above and behaves as cosmological constant . to show such behavior graphically ,",
    "let us express the state parameter @xmath6 in terms of the red - shift parameter @xmath47 which is defined as ,    @xmath48,\\ ] ] where , @xmath49 is the present value of the scale factor , while @xmath50 is that value at some arbitrary time @xmath35 , when the light was emitted from a cosmological source .",
    "thus ,    t^f = t_o^f - n ( 1+z).in view of equation ( 11 ) @xmath6 can be expressed as ,    w_de= ( ) , where , @xmath51 has been set equal to one without any loss of generality .",
    "let us now choose @xmath52 .",
    "the motivation of choosing such a value of @xmath53 is twofold .",
    "primarily , it is impossible to find an explicit form of the potential @xmath54 , otherwise .",
    "further , since @xmath55 has the dimension of @xmath56 , so the parameter @xmath57 gets a comfortable dimension of time .",
    "if we now take up some more numbers , like the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath58 and the age of the universe @xmath59 as ,    @xmath60 then , for @xmath61 , @xmath55 can be found from the ansatz ( 9 ) as @xmath62 .",
    "further taking the present value of the matter density parameter @xmath63 , we find in view of solution ( 10 ) , @xmath64 where , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the present values of the matter density and the critical density respectively .",
    "thus , we find ,    @xmath67 noting that in this model the red - shift parameter does not go beyond the value @xmath68 , we plot the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath69 versus the red - shift parameter @xmath70 in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "it is apparent that the phantom divide line @xmath71 has been crossed twice , once from above at @xmath72 and then from below at @xmath73 .",
    "such double crossing of the phantom divide line is devoid of any sort of pathological behaviour .",
    "[ ptb ]    to check how far our present model fits with the standard @xmath1 model , we also make the luminosity - redshift and distance modulus - redshift plots . for @xmath1 model",
    "the relation between the luminosity distance and redshift is the following , @xmath74 while the relation corresponding to the present model is , @xmath75dz,\\ ] ] with @xmath76 gyr . , and @xmath77 .",
    "the plot ( figure 2 ) shows a perfect fit between the two models up to @xmath78 . there is a little discrepancy there after . since",
    ", luminosity distance has already been expressed as a function of redshift , so the relation between distance modulus and redshift may be found in view of the following equation , @xmath79 where , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the apparent and absolute bolometric magnitudes respectively . however , since we use @xmath82 instead , so our relation is slightly modified as , @xmath83 where , @xmath84 .",
    "the plot ( figure 3 ) demonstrates that the two models are practically indistinguishable .",
    "[ ptb ]    [ ptb ]    now we can proceed to make some even more comfortable choice of the parameters of the theory , like @xmath52 , and @xmath76 gyr . as before , but with @xmath85 , for which @xmath86 gyr .",
    ", in view of ansatz ( 9 ) , which corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "the scale factor now has a convenient form as @xmath88 . with these values",
    "one can find , @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "the plot ( fig.4 ) is almost the same as before with transient double crossing .",
    "other plots viz . ,",
    "luminosity distance versus redshift ( in figure 5 ) and distance modulus versus redshift ( in figure 6 ) show even better fit than the earlier one , with the standard @xmath1 model .",
    "[ ptb ]    [ ptb ]    [ ptb ]    thus , we observe that with the age @xmath76 gyr . ,",
    "and @xmath91 , such transient crossing of the phantom divide line is permissible for the present value of dark energy density parameter @xmath92 . in order to consider some higher value of the age of the universe , @xmath93 gyr .",
    "( say ) as suggested by spergel et al@xcite , either one has to go to almost the lowest limiting value of @xmath94 @xcite or one has to accept much higher value of the present dark energy density parameter @xmath95 , otherwise , the state parameter versus redshift plot shows certain discontinuities .",
    "we certainly remember that in order to simplify the field equations considerably , we have made one important assumption , viz .",
    ", in equation ( 5 ) . relaxing this assumption one might get rid of such discontinuities , as well .",
    "this we pose to study in a future communication .",
    "+ so far , we remain silent about the form of the potential .",
    "it is simply because , despite the most convenient choice of the parameter , @xmath96 , it is still impossible to find an analytical solution for @xmath32 , in view of the solution ( 10 ) . as a result , the form of the potential as a function of @xmath32 remains obscure .",
    "however , we can plot the potential as a function of time , by choosing our second case , @xmath97 , for further simplification .",
    "it is important to note that though the results sofar obtained , are independent of the value and signature of @xmath38 , the form of the potential depends largely on it . in the following we make three such plots ( taking the help of `` manipulation '' programme of mathematica 6 ) to show how the form of the potential changes with different values ( starting from negative to large positive ) of @xmath38 .    [ ptb ]    [ ptb ]    [ ptb ]",
    "altogether we have obtained a late time transient crossing of the phantom divide line first from above and more recently from below , starting from the inclusion of a gauss - bonnet - dilatonic scalar coupling term in the standard einstein - hilbert action in four dimension .",
    "since the crossing is transient , so such double crossing is free from any sort of pathological behaviour both at the classical @xcite and at the quantum mechanical @xcite levels .",
    "the striking feature of the model lyes in it s indistinguishability with the standard @xmath9 model , in terms of the luminosity - redshift and more precisely for distance modulus - redshift curves . to identify between the two models we therefore require to observe dark energy equation of state @xmath6 independently .",
    "if @xmath6 is truly found to be dynamical and has really encountered a recent crossing of the phantom divide line , then only we can definitely distinguish the standard @xmath1 model with the present one .",
    "it is highly interesting to learn that smooth transient crossing of the phantom divide line is allowed for both negative and positive @xmath98 type of gauss - bonnet - scalar interaction .",
    "figures ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) also reveal that it is true even for different forms of the potential .",
    "such transient crossing independent of the value of @xmath38 also signals that it might be possible to carry out the same treatment even for a single scalar field model .",
