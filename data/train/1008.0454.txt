    "many pulsars are among the most highly polarized astrophysical sources of radiation . one polarized parameter ,",
    "the position angle of linear polarization @xmath3 ( also called the ppa  polarized position angle ) is a particularly useful quantity : it carries information about the intrinsic geometry of the emitting region at the pulsar [ e.g. , via the rotating vector model @xcite ] ; it also probes the magnetized plasma along the line of sight through faraday rotation measurements [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of the polarized position angle on timescales of @xmath4 d , in order to investigate time - variable behaviors of pulsars magnetospheric geometry and the interstellar medium .",
    "for example , precession of the neutron star or other long - timescale oscillatory behavior affecting the emission beam will change the ppa , as will variations in the magnetized interstellar plasma along the line of sight .",
    "ninety - eight pulsars were observed at 21 cm from arecibo observatory every few months for several years from 1989 to 1993 .",
    "the resulting grand average polarized pulse profiles were analyzed in @xcite , where observing details can also be found . in the present work , we found that we had adequate data on eighty - one of the pulsars to search for temporal variations of polarized position angle .",
    "for all of them , the polarized position angles were originally measured relative to an unknown origin .",
    "consequently , in the present work , in order to search for temporal _ changes _ in position angle , we needed to reference our data to a position - angle standard .",
    "to do so , we selected two calibrator pulsars , b0540 + 23 ( j0543 + 2329 ) and b1929 + 10 ( j1932 + 1059 ) . the calibrators were chosen on the basis of the relative constancy of their ppa s during full - sky arecibo observing tracks .",
    "we then compared the measured polarized position angle of a target pulsar on a given observing session to the ppa of one of the two calibrator pulsars . while the _",
    "absolute _ position angle is still unknown , this referencing procedure enables us to be sensitive to position angle _ changes _ over time , assuming only that the position angle of the calibrators remains fixed over time .",
    "the procedures are described in the following sections ; mathematical details are given in appendix a.    in the rare cases where a calibrator pulsar was not observed during a daily session , we created an artificial `` meshed '' calibrator pulsar by determining its expected position angle on that session from observations of all other pulsars during that session .",
    "pulsars tend to be very highly linearly polarized objects .",
    "the observed linear polarization originates at or near the star , often following the magnetic field lines at the point of origin @xcite , and is then modified by various propagation effects .",
    "we define the generic polarized position angle  curve \" for a pulsar at epoch @xmath5 , a function of pulsar longitude @xmath6 at fixed @xmath5 , as the set of polarized position angles @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "( see the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : obspas ] for examples of ppa curves . )    the measured ppa curve at epoch @xmath5 can be expressed as the sum of five terms  an ensemble average ( denoted below by angular brackets ) for the indicated pulsar longitude @xmath6 and epoch @xmath5 which reflects the pulsar s intrinsic orientation , an interstellar faraday rotation term , an instrumental origin , and a term arising from errors due to radiometer noise and one from intrinsic pulse - to - pulse fluctuations in amplitude and phase of individual pulses ( called `` jitter ; '' see @xcite and further discussion below ) :",
    "@xmath9    the first two terms on the right - hand side of the above equation hold the physics of interest in this experiment  namely the temporal behavior of the pulsar s orientation or magnetosphere , and of the interstellar magnetic field through which its signals propagate , respectively .",
    "the third term defines the instrumentally measured ppa corresponding to an absolute ppa on the sky of zero .",
    "the latter two terms , though having zero mean , represent phenomena that add variance to the measurements , thereby limiting our precision in specifying the first two .",
    "we now discuss each of these five terms in order .      * ( a ) precession : * precession would lead to a periodic wobble of the pulsar orientation .",
    "most pulsar magnetospheric models indicate that the polarized emission is tied fundamentally to the geometry of the magnetic field in the emitting regions .",
    "hence it is expected that a periodic wobble in pulsar orientation translates directly into a periodic variation of similar amplitude in polarized position angle .",
    "therefore , a search for temporal variations in ppa is a sensitive probe for the presence of precession .",
    "the simplest model is one where the wobble would result from the free precession of an asymmetric isolated pulsar , although there also exist models where the precession is forced by an external disk or companion @xcite , or by the star s own radiation @xcite .",
    "we assume that the neutron star is approximately spherical , with a slight axially symmetric oblateness about a symmetry axis .",
    "hence the three moments of inertia have the relationship @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the moment parallel to the symmetry axis .",
    "( for extension of the precession model to a triaxial body , see @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the motion of a point on the star can be decomposed into a quick rotation about the total angular momentum vector plus a slow precession about the body symmetry axis . for a sketch of the process and a link to an animation ,",
    "[ fig : animation ] ; for readers wishing to modify the geometrical parameters of the animation , the mathematica source code is also available online at the mathsource library @xcite .",

    "very slow precession , with a period of many years , would produce just a linear trend in ppa with epoch .    *",
    "( b)magnetospheric adjustments : * as we will describe below , there are theoretical difficulties ( though not insoluble ones ) with the picture of precession - induced pulse shape variations , centered primarily on the long observed timescales and relatively large inferred amplitudes . @xcite",
    "have proposed an alternate model whereby the pulse shape and timing variations are caused by slowly rotating magnetospheric currents rather than by precession of the whole star .",
    "while this is an interesting alternative interpretation of the observations , more work needs to be done to flesh out the model and to verify that it can explain the observed timescales and amplitudes .",
    "in this section , we focus on studying variations in the magnetized ism plasma via a search for temporal variations in ppa . the second term of eq .",
    "[ eqn : basicpsi ] quantifies faraday rotation of the ppa in the interstellar medium , @xmath16 , at some epoch , @xmath5 .",
    "the rotation measure , @xmath17 , is defined so as to specify the angle of ppa faraday rotation at wavelength @xmath18 : @xmath19 with angle in radians , @xmath18 in m , and @xmath17 in rad m@xmath20 .",
    "a measured change in ppa , @xmath21 , then implies a change in faraday rotation measure , @xmath22 : @xmath23    in order to relate @xmath24 to the ism , we express @xmath25 as a function of fundamental properties along the pulsar  earth path : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight in @xmath28 g , @xmath29 is the electron density in electrons@xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a differential path element whose integrated distance is @xmath32 @xcite .",

    "since measurements show that temporal variations of dispersion measure @xmath33 , are generally quite small @xcite , we further expect that any observed variations in @xmath25 would originate principally from the pulsar carrying the line of sight across an inhomogeneity in @xmath27 . therefore , we model the rm change as resulting from the line of sight passing across a discrete region having a variation in the parallel field , @xmath34 , occupying a fraction @xmath35 of the pulsar - earth path , with _ no _ associated @xmath29 variation .    in this case ,",

    "[ eqn : basicpsi ] represents a conversion of absolute ppa on the sky , to ppa measured in the instrumental frame .",
    "the instrumental frame involves geometrical terms associated with telescope orientation as well as instrumental phase delays during a given session . as noted above in  [ sec : obsana ] , we did not directly determine the instrumental ppa but rather referenced our measured ppa to the ppa of a calibrator pulsar , which has its own variance ( see  [ sec : offset ] ) .      the noise term in eq .",
    "[ eqn : basicpsi ] results from the finite sampling statistics of a noisy signal and is familiar to all radioastronomers .",
    "its contribution to the variance , @xmath41 , was determined empirically by measuring the variance off - pulse .      the jitter term in eq .",
    "[ eqn : basicpsi ] is unique to pulsars and requires further explanation , especially because it often dominates the error budget .",
    "we characterize as `` jitter '' all ppa changes on pulse - to - pulse timescales that are counterparts to the arrival - time jitter of individual subpulses .",
    "these random ppa variations occur due to various propagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere analogous to faraday rotation .",
    "these fluctuations might be correlated , for example , for the duration of a single subpulse in a given pulse period , but would be uncorrelated _ between _ subpulses and _ across _ pulse periods .",
    "random variations in _",
    "altitude _ of emission would produce a ppa curve that is shifted earlier or later for higher or lower altitudes , respectively .",
    "this kind of variation would also be highly correlated across a single subpulse .",

    "with the subpulse as the basic unit of correlated emission , the jitter - induced fluctuations in the measurement of ppa after @xmath51 pulses , each containing @xmath61 subpulses , will be characterized by @xmath62    since we could not directly measure the quantities @xmath63 and @xmath61 with our two - minute integrations , we surveyed the literature for typical values .",

    "first , there are the cases of the vela and crab nebula pulsars @xcite .",
    "the variations of @xmath25 ( and also of @xmath107 ) are so large and frequent that they are almost certainly associated with passage of inhomogeneous nebular snr material across the line of sight .",
    "this interpretation is easy to reconcile with these pulsars relative youth and the observed presence of an snr .",
    "there are other reports in the literature of @xmath25 variations toward ordinary pulsars on multiyear timescales , sometimes accompanied by @xmath107 variations as well @xcite , which appear to be caused by the passage of a cloud across the line of sight .",
    "@xcite measured many pulsar @xmath25s and compared their results with earlier work wherever possible .",
    "they noted numerous cases of @xmath25s changing significantly with respect to values measured @xmath125 yr earlier , while the @xmath107 tended to vary far less on similar timescales .",
    "yet our sample of pulsars exhibits only rare evidence for @xmath25 variations over the four years of observation , and _ no _ evidence for sustained changes or long - term trends .",
    "we can suggest several possible resolutions to the disagreement between the rather common @xmath25 changes in the literature and our finding of essentially steady @xmath25s in our sample : ( 1 ) @xmath25 variations tend to be small on the four - year timescale of our experiment , but grow on decade - long scales .",
    "this would have interesting implications for the fluctuation spectrum of interstellar plasma .",
    "however , recall that we have some sensitivity to changes on timescales longer than our dataspan , but no evidence was found for variations on scales beyond @xmath126 d. ( 2 ) a subtle nonorthogonal emission mode competition process can lead to spurious apparent @xmath25 variations @xcite , which might grow with time .",
    "( 3 ) one of the previously published multiepoch @xmath25 measurements was incorrect .",
    "this latter possibility can not be ruled out , since @xmath25 measurements are difficult , and since the pairs of observations were frequently performed by different groups on different telescopes .",
    "further measurements are required in order to determine the correct explanation .",
    "we have studied the temporal behavior of polarized position angle in 81 pulsars over a @xmath127 yr period .",
    "we demonstrate that the intrinsic pulse - to - pulse jitter of polarized subpulses frequently dominates the uncertainty in position angle determination .",
    "we searched particularly for sinusoidal variations , discontinuous changes , and linear trends in the data .",
    "nineteen pulsars have variations in ppa that were significantly better fit ( at the 3@xmath0 level ) by a sinuoidal function than by a constant ; such variations could be caused by precession or other cyclical phenomena at the pulsar .",
    "these pulsars ( and especially the four pulsars in our `` class i '' ) are good candidates for further study . a handful of discontinuous changes were observed in the sample , which could be due to the passage of the line of sight across an interstellar region with significantly different magnetized properties .",
    "no linear variations ( i.e. , `` ramps '' ) of ppa across the timespan of observations were detected .",

    "<S> in order to study precession and interstellar magnetic field variations , we measured the polarized position angle of 81 pulsars at several - month intervals for four years . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the uncertainties in a single - epoch measurement of position angle is usually dominated by random pulse - to - pulse jitter of the polarized subpulses . even with these uncertainties , we find that the position angle variations in 19 pulsars are significantly better fitted ( at the 3@xmath0 level ) by a sinusoid than by a constant . </S>",
    "<S> such variations could be caused by precession , which would then indicate periods of @xmath1  d and amplitudes of @xmath2  degrees . </S>",
    "<S> we narrow this collection to four pulsars that show the most convincing evidence of sinusoidal variation in position angle.also , in a handful of pulsars , single discrepant position angle measurements are observed which may result from the line of sight passing across a discrete ionized , magnetized structure . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the standard deviation of position angle measurements from the mean for each pulsar , and relate these to limits on precession and interstellar magnetic field variations . </S>"
