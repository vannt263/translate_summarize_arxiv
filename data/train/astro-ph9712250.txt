    "the main idea behind the unification models for active galactic nuclei ( see antonucci 1993 and references therein for a review ) is that orientation plays a significant and decisive role in seyfert classification . in terms of our current understanding of agns ,",
    "the central engine is probably a massive black hole , surrounded by an accretion disk and fast - moving clouds , responsible for the production of strong gravitationally and doppler - broadened lines , completely covered by a molecular torus .",
    "more distant uncovered clouds are , on the contrary , the origin of the narrow lines . studies of the x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies ( awaki & koyama 1993 ) have revealed the presence of highly obscured nuclei with power law spectra and fek@xmath7 lines similar to seyfert 1 objects providing further support to the popular unification models for agns . if the orientation is such that the line of sight intercepts the torus ( krolik & begelman 1986 ) , the optical / uv radiation including the blr emission as well as soft x - rays from the nucleus are blocked and the source , visible at these wavelengths in scattered light , is classified as a type 2 . the scattering medium ( krolik & kallman 1987 ) , whose physical state is unfortunately still poorly known , is likely to be a warm plasma located along the torus axis .",
    "+ with respect to the hard x - ray emission , the spectral index distribution of seyfert 2 s should be the same as for seyfert 1 s .",

    "in fact , the re - analysis of a sample of 15 seyfert 2 galaxies observed by ginga ( smith & done 1996 ) has indicated that the spectral slope of about half of them is significantly flatter ( @xmath2 @xmath3 1.5 ) than the mean value found for seyfert 1 ( @xmath2 @xmath3 1.9 - 2.0 , nandra & pounds 1994 ; gondek et al . 1996 ) .",
    "at least 4 of these sources are incompatible with the steep seyfert 1 slope , even with the addition to the primary spectrum of a strong reflection component .",
    "moreover , awaki ( 1991 ) has pointed out that a small subsample of iras selected seyfert 2 galaxies shows no evidence of any obscuring medium ( @xmath12 @xmath13 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) and is well described by a rather steep continuum with no reflection component . on the basis of these results there",

    "the whole observation can be explained assuming a model , called `` leaky - total absorber '' , which consists of a dual - absorber configuration , where the underlying continuum is parameterized to be that of a seyfert 1 ( @xmath2 = 1.9 ) .",
    "a partially ( @xmath3 36% ) covering material , either blr clouds or the inner , disrupted parts of the torus , surrounds the source and gives rise to an absorption of about 10@xmath11 @xmath6 .",
    "this material is considered to be responsible for the iron line and edge features . moreover ,",
    "the totally covering matter , probably associated with the molecular torus ( or the outer parts of it ) , produces the optical and the soft x - ray absorption ( @xmath12 @xmath3 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) .",
    "this model explains the observed spectral features , has the advantage to have a straightforward physical interpretation in the framework of unified models and provides a solution of the apparent puzzle of points 2 and 3 .",
    "we thank all the members of the asca team who operate the satellite and maintain the software and database .",

    "<S> asca x - ray spectral analysis of the seyfert 2 galaxy iras  04575@xmath07537 is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is the presence of a significant iron edge at a rest energy of 7.13@xmath1 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is flat ( @xmath2 @xmath3 1.5 ) with a substantial absorption n@xmath4 @xmath3 10@xmath5 @xmath6 and does not require any reflection component . </S>",
    "<S> there is also evidence of a narrow fek@xmath7 emission line , whose rest energy ( e = 6.35@xmath8 kev ) and equivalent width ( ew @xmath9 130@xmath10 ev ) suggest that the line originates from thick and cold matter . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the line and , in particular , the depth of the iron edge are too strong to be explained by simple transmission through the measured absorption column density . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that a model more complex than a single absorbed power law is needed . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an absorption model that we call `` leaky - total absorber '' which can explain the spectrum flatness , the iron emission line and the edge absorption feature and has also the advantage of having a straightforward physical interpretation in the framework of unified models . in this model </S>",
    "<S> a thick absorber ( n@xmath4 @xmath3 10@xmath11 @xmath6 ) , possibly associated with broad line region ( blr ) clouds , partially ( @xmath3 36% ) covers the source continuum with @xmath2 fixed to 1.9 as observed in sey 1 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the escaping radiation is then absorbed by a column density n@xmath4 @xmath3 10@xmath5 @xmath6 , which can be attributed to the torus , seen through its rim . </S>"
