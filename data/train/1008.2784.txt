    "generation and distribution of entanglement between remote particles is a necessary requirement for quantum information transfer @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that spin chains are one of the most promising quantum channels for creation of spin - spin entanglement rmp08 .",
    "it appears , that in spite of existence of correlations in spin chains , the amount of entanglement generated between two particular spins rapidly decays with the distance between them @xcite , @xcite even near the point of quantum phase transition @xcite . so that , the implementation of efficient mechanisms for entangling spatially separated subsystems is still a challenging problem , especially for massive particles .    during the last years",
    "different types of spin - spin interactions have been extensively studied as possible candidates to entangle remote particles .",
    "it has been proved that for certain types of spin-@xmath1 open heisenberg chains , it is possible to entangle the ends of the chain by action of stationary hamiltonians @xcite and implementing different mechanisms like mirror symmetry @xcite , dimerized models or weak couplings at the ends of the chain @xcite , performing a quench @xcite , quench2 , or considering alternating couplings between the spins @xcite .",
    "* *  * * also , * *  * * several dynamical schemes , such as application of optimized time - dependent magnetic field @xcite and periodically time - dependent nearest - neighbor coupling @xcite have been proposed to faithfully entangle the ends of an open spin chain .",
    "unfortunately , only a partial ( although a quite large ) entanglement can be achieved with these schemes . besides , owing mathematical complexity of the problem , the main tool for studying such systems remains numerical simulations .",
    "the simplest type of interaction between massive particles is the homogeneous ising chain .",
    "being the simplest type of interaction , it has been a candidate for implementation of quantum information algorithms since the very beginning @xcite .",
    "it worth noting a recent proposal for measurement - based quantum computation @xcite using homogeneous ising - like interaction .",
    "also , this kind of interaction accompanied by the global @xmath0 pulses allows  a perfect qubit transport , quantum mirrors and universal quantum computation @xcite .    on the other hand , the possibility of application of pulses to quantum systems in order to preserve the coherence was discussed several years ago @xcite , and recently , the idea of applying optimized @xmath0 pulses at irregular intervals of time was proposed and studied by uhrig @xcite for efficient control of dephasing in spin systems and later applied for preserving entanglement in dephasing environments @xcite .    in this article",
    "we propose a simple _ analytical _ scheme which allows to create a transient entanglement between the ends of an homogeneous spin chain by means of application of a sequence of @xmath0 pulses on some particular spins .",
    "we apply @xmath0 pulses not to all qubits ( as it was proposed in @xcite to control a qubit transport ) but only to a part of them , which results in a perfect transient entanglement between the ends the chain .",
    "let us consider an open chain of @xmath2 spins @xmath1 with homogeneous ising - like interaction ( the coupling constant is taken to be unity ) , governed by the hamiltonian @xmath3and initially prepared in the coherent superposition @xmath4since @xmath5 is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian eq.([hint ] ) , some specific spin - spin correlations arise during the hamiltonian evolution , @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix @xmath7 can be found in the following closed form , @xmath8    \\notag \\\\ & & \\left ( \\frac{1}{2}+\\cos \\frac{t}{2}\\hat{s}_{xn}+2\\sin \\frac{t}{2}\\hat{s}_{yn}\\hat{s}_{zn-1}\\right ) ,   \\label{statenk}\\end{aligned}\\]]in the hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) only nearest neighbors interact , and a dynamical pairwise entanglement is generated between them . as it can easily be seen from ( [ statenk ] ) ,",
    "the entanglement dynamics between all the pairs in the middle of the chain is the same , the concurrence wootters:1998a , is given by @xmath9 ,   \\label{c_middle}\\]]where @xmath10 and its maximum is @xmath11 . since the spin chain is open , the concurrences for the spins @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the spins @xmath14 and @xmath2 are different that given in eq .",
    "( [ c_middle ] ) , @xmath15reaching the maximum of @xmath1 at @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to stress that non neighboring pairs of spins will never get entangled under the hamiltonian evolution .",
    "in order to generate entanglement between the ends of the chain let us apply instant @xmath0 pulses to the first @xmath14 spins at certain times @xmath19 .",
    "such kicks correspond to rotations around the @xmath20-axis , and for the @xmath21-th spin are represented by the operator @xmath22 .",
    "the main idea is as follows : initially all the spins are in eigenstates of @xmath23 so that , in the course of the evolution governed by eq.(hint ) , some spins become correlated . at the instant @xmath24",
    "we apply a @xmath0-rotation to the first @xmath14 spins , producing flip of those spins .",
    "afterwards , the evolution under the hamiltonian eq.([hint ] ) allowed to continue leading to the recoupling of all the spins .",
    "then , at the instant @xmath25 we apply the inverse @xmath0-rotation , allowing the system to evolve further and repeat this cycle until @xmath26 spin flips are performed at times @xmath27 , @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 where @xmath30 . using ( [ psi_t ] )",
    "we now proceed to compute the reduced density matrix and the ( time - dependent ) concurrence @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the three - spin case is special , since the middle spin is coupled to both ends . for a three - spin chain a single @xmath0 pulse at @xmath24 , applied to the first and second spins , produces entanglement between the ends .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the concurrence for the first and third spins : @xmath32i.e .",
    "the first and third spins , which were not entangled before the pulse ( @xmath33 ) , become completely entangled at @xmath34 , while @xmath35 for @xmath36 .    for longer chains",
    "the dynamical behavior of the pairwise entanglement is rather unusual .",
    "after the first kick and before the @xmath37-nd kick the pairwise entanglement between any pair of spins disappears .",
    "since the system is closed , the pairwise entanglement transforms into a multipartite entanglement during that time .",
    "moreover , after the @xmath38nd kick it is possible to obtain the following analytic expression for the concurrence between the ends of the chain :    \\a ) for the even number of spins @xmath39 , & t\\geq(n-2)\\pi \\\\ 0 , & t<(n-2)\\pi\\end{array } \\right .",

    "\\label{c_odd}\\ ] ] while the nearest neighbors in the middle of the chain recover their original transient entanglement @xmath41/2 $ ] for times @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the subsystem containing the first and the last spins of the chain stays in an unentangled state until the last kick is applied . as a result the subsystem reaches a maximally entangled state at the moments @xmath43 , being unentangled with the rest of the chain , in accordance with the monogamy property @xcite**. * * so that , the time needed to completely entangle the ends of the chain linearly depends on the length of the chain . in particular ,",
    "at the instant @xmath44 the state of the chain is as follows : @xmath45   \\\\ & & \\left [ \\left\\vert 00\\right\\rangle _ { 1n}+\\left\\vert 11\\right\\rangle _ { 1n}+i\\left ( \\left\\vert 01\\right\\rangle _ { 1n}+\\left\\vert 10\\right\\rangle _ { 1n}\\right ) \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the concurrence between the spins 1 and 2 , and the spins @xmath14 and @xmath2 , remains zero for any @xmath46 .",
    "for the chain with ( a ) @xmath47 spins for @xmath48 , @xmath49 ; and ( b ) @xmath50 spins for @xmath48 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",

    "the dashed line shows the purity of the of subsystem composed by the first and the last spins of the corresponding chain , @xmath58 .",
    "observe that , due to the hamiltonian evolution , the concurrence and purity keeps oscillating after application of the last kick .    in order to study the behavior of concurrence @xmath31 when the times @xmath19 of application of the @xmath0-pulses are not commensurable ,",
    "we have numerically calculated @xmath59 as a function of @xmath60 and @xmath61 at different fixed times . in fig.[pic_c_t1_t2 ] we plot the concurrence @xmath31 for @xmath47 spins at time @xmath62 ( compare with fig.pic_c_4_7 ( a ) ) when @xmath60 @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "we can observe that @xmath65 has a pronounced maximum , @xmath66 at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and smoothly decreases when @xmath67 deviate from these optimal values .     for chain of @xmath47 spins as a function of the moments of applied kicks at fixed time @xmath68.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have studied the dynamics a one - dimensional open ising chain of @xmath2 spins assisted by phase kicks at times @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "it is found that the application of @xmath26 instant pulses to @xmath14 spins leads to arising of transient perfect entanglement between the first and the last spins of the chain .",
    "one interesting results is that , if the number of pulses is less than required , then every pairwise concurrence would be zero .",
    "the periodic behavior of the concurrence between the ends of the chain , @xmath69 reaches the maximum value @xmath70 at some specific times even when the pulses are stopped being applied and the chain evolves under the hamiltonian ( hint ) only .",
    "this effect substantially enlarges possible applications of the low - dimensional spin chains in quantum information technology .",
    "it is easy to see that combining the present scheme with quench one can entangle any two spins @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , in the chain , i.e. to model a quantum router .",
    "really , we just have to disconnect  the chain @xcite from 1 to @xmath74 and from @xmath75 to @xmath2 and then apply the above discussed sequence of pulses .",
    "it worth noting that similar local transformations in the form of instant pulses were also used for another purposes : for atomic squeezing enhancement in the dicke states @xcite , for intensification of the entanglement in continuous - variables @xcite and in two - spin @xcite systems .",
