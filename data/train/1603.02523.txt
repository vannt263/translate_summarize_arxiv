    "quantized vortices are a hallmark for superfluidity and superconductivity , and have been a subject of interest since a long time @xcite .",
    "stable vortices and vortex arrays have been successfully realized in rotating condensates of bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite .",
    "superfluid fermi gases are of particular interest because the tunability of the interatomic interaction strength allows to investigate the crossover between a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of strongly bound molecules and a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state of cooper pairs .",
    "the experimental achievements stimulated theorists to explore the physics of vortices and vortex matter in rotating , trapped quantum gases .",
    "different theoretical models can be applied to describe vortices . for bose gases ,",
    "the most common method is to employ the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "superfluid fermi gases can however be studied by a variety of methods , the most common are : the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) formalism @xcite , the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory @xcite , superfluid density functional theory @xcite , the density matrix renormalization group @xcite and the coarse - grained bdg approximation @xcite .",
    "to describe vortices in condensates throughout the bec - bcs crossover , it appears that the bdg theory is the preferred method @xcite .",
    "the problem with the bdg theory is however that the method is computationally fairly cumbersome .",
    "consequently the use of the bdg theory is mainly limited to the consideration of zero - temperature properties of single - vortex states @xcite .",
    "because of this big computational cost of the bdg theory , there is a recent interest in the development of effective field theories @xcite .",
    "these effective field theories allow for a description of non - uniform excitations ( e.g. vortices and solitons ) in finite - temperature fermi gases throughout the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "they require much less computational cost with respect to the bdg calculations and allow for the variational methods and sometimes for exact analytic solutions @xcite .",
    "consequently , the effective ktd theory @xcite is used in the present work .",
    "the effective ktd theory corresponds nicely with the numerical bdg results , except in the deep bcs regime for temperatures far below @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the range of the considered scattering lengths @xmath1 will be limited to @xmath2 $ ] , where the effective ktd theory has a good correspondence .    in this paper",
    ", we use the ktd energy functional to study the order parameter in the neighbourhood of the vortex core , throughout the bec - bcs crossover at finite temperatures .",
    "a common ( variational ) assumption is that the order parameter @xmath3 heals according to @xmath4 $ ] where @xmath5 is the distance to the vortex core , @xmath6 is the characteristic  healing  length mentioned above , and @xmath7 is the ",
    "order parameter far away from the vortex . here ,",
    "we investigate how good the assumption of a tanh - dependence is for a fermi superfluid , in which regime the largest deviations from it are to be expected , and how the resulting estimate for the healing length is affected .",
    "the considered ktd effective field theory @xcite is derived using the path - integral formalism .",
    "the starting point is the lagrangian for an @xmath8-wave scattering potential , which is a common low - temperature potential for atomic gases .",
    "the non - linear interaction term is then eliminated by using a hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite , leading to a bosonic ( pair ) field @xmath9 with an effective potential .",
    "finally a gradient expansion ( up to second order ) is made around the coordinate - dependent saddle - point value of the bosonic field .",
    "this yields matsubara summations which can be done analytically , resulting in the effective field theory . to allow for spin imbalance , chemical potentials @xmath10",
    "are introduced which can differ for the  spin - up  and  spin - down  species .",
    "using these , the ( average ) chemical potential @xmath11 and ( spin-)imbalance @xmath12 are defined . in",

    "a common variational choice for the vortex profile is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath6 is a variational parameter representing the healing length .",

    "for the derivatives , a backwards differentiation scheme is chosen , using this , the free energy density becomes : @xmath56 with @xmath57 .    to find the true vortex structure ,",
    "the free energy should now be minimized with respect to the set of variational parameters @xmath58 , where the boundary conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are imposed .",

    "this iteration goes as follows : the numerical algorithm runs sequentially through the list of @xmath65 values , from @xmath67 up to and including @xmath68 . for each value of @xmath65 two new ( random ) values",
    "are generated as @xmath69)f_n^{(i)}$ ] , where @xmath70 $ ] is a random number between 0 and 1 , and @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "the energy of the old structure is compared with the energy of the new structure where @xmath65 is replaced by @xmath73 , the value with the lowest energy will be chosen for the new function value @xmath74 .",
    "the starting value for @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) and this value is lowered ( or @xmath77 is raised ) throughout the different loops in the algorithm .",
    "the criterion for lowering the value of @xmath78 is that 5% or less of the points @xmath73 are accepted , hence if the vortex structure practically does nt change any more .",
    "the monte - carlo loop will keep on running until @xmath79 and 5% or less of the points change . in order to allow for simulated annealing the complete loop will run 5 times , resetting the value of @xmath78 to 1 each time . this way it is possible to jump out of a local minimum whenever stuck .",
    "the resulting algorithm is depicted in figure [ fig : algorithm ] .        in order to get reliable values for our results",
    ", we will do 5 independent vortex structure calculations , which will independently be analysed .",
    "this allows to give an error bar to the results .",

    "the black dashed line is the variational solution for the same set of parameters .",
    "the error bars on the result are so small ( about 0.1 - 0.01% of the value ) that they are not visible on the plot . ]    after determining the vortex structure , the following properties of the vortex structure are calculated :    * the healing length @xmath81 , obtained by fitting a tangent hyperbolic to the numerical result . * the quadratic distance between the numerical solution @xmath82 and the variational solution with healing length : @xmath83 . * the goodness of fit , given by @xmath84 .",
    "being equal to zero in the case of a perfect fit and becoming larger ( maximum 1 ) the worse a fit gets .",
    "the value of @xmath85 is defined as the ratio of the model sum of squares to the total sum of squares .    for each set of parameters @xmath80 the calculation",
    "is done five times , leading to a mean value and error ( standard deviation ) . in the subsequent results , only the mean",
    "values are shown .",
    "the maximum value reached for the relative error was about 1% for the healing length .",
    "the results are discussed in the following subsections .    in figure",
    "[ fig : healinglengthnumeric ] the healing length is plotted for different values of the temperature and polarization .     found by fitting a tangent hyperbolic to the found vortex stucture for different temperatures and polarizations .",

    "the inset shows the ratio of the fitted value to the variational value @xmath86.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    it is obvious from the plots that the correction to the variational healing length is very small .",
    "the obtained correction is about 0.1% to 1.1% ( @xmath87 ) . only when the polarization becomes large and we go to negative values for @xmath88 it is seen that the correction factor suddenly becomes big ( up to 10% ) .",
    "this unstable behaviour is seen in almost all of the results and discussed in the final subsection .",
    "the goodness of fit is determined by looking at the @xmath85-value , together with the square distance between the variational and numerical solution . in figure",
    "[ fig : fitnumeric ] the results are given for different values of the temperature and polarization .",
    ".,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as can be seen the distance between the variational and numerical solution is rather small .",
    "moreover the value of @xmath84 is very small , implying that the shape of the variational solution fits the vortex structure rather well .",
    "finally the difference in energy is studied as a function of the scattering length for different temperatures and polarizations .",
    "the result can be found in figure [ fig : energydifferencenumeric ] .            comparing the relative energy difference , it can be seen that for most cases ( ignoring the unstable behaviour ) we see a relative energy difference of about 0.3% to 0.7% .",
    "this is a clue that the tangent hyperbolic might be sufficient to study ( single ) vortex behaviour .    for high polarizations at low values of @xmath88",
    "it is apparent that there is a turning point where the results became unstable .",
    "the reason for this is that in this case the bulk - value @xmath19 in equation approaches zero , so the system is near the so - called clogston limit , where the imbalance drives a superfluid - to - normal transition . in figure",
    "[ fig : saddlepointbandgap ] the saddle point gap is sketched .     for @xmath45 and different polarizations .",
    "the solid line yields the true value for the bandgap ( which minimizes the free energy on saddle - point level ) , the dashed line yields the second ( local ) minimum . ]",
    "note that there are cases where the saddle - point equation has two non - zero solutions for the band gap .",
    "it is for the values of @xmath80 where there are two possible values for @xmath19 that the unstable behaviour appears .",
    "this means that the hyperbolic tangent variational model is unstable near the superfluid phase transition .",
    "the values for @xmath88 for which the unstable behaviour will start to appear can be easily calculated , this is done by looking for the largest value of @xmath88 for which two values of @xmath19 are possible . for the cases studied in this article ,",
    "these values are given in the table below .",
    "these can be compared with the low - temperature , no polarization case ( @xmath89100,@xmath900 ) which becomes unstable for @xmath91 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the higher the temperature and polarization become , the sooner the unstable behaviour will start .",
    "in this paper the structure of a vortex was studied using the ktd effective field theory . from the obtained results",
    "it can be concluded that , away from the clogston limit , the hyperbolic tangent :    * yields a very accurate guess for the vortex healing length .",
    "* gives an excellent fit for the vortex structure .",
    "* produces a good estimate for the vortex free energy .",
    "this means that , as long as the system is not near the clogston limit where spin - imbalance destroys superfluidity , the assumption of a hyperbolic tangent for the vortex core profile is valid . using this analytic fit ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties can be estimated well , and it is possible to study also multivortex states .",
    "however the treatment of multivortex states requires some caution . even though the hyperbolic tangent yields an accurate representation of the vortex structure ,",
    "there is still some error in the result .",
    "this means for example that when one studies single- or multi - vortex states near unitarity , it is impossible to distinguish between two states that only differ slightly ( about 1% ) in energy .",
