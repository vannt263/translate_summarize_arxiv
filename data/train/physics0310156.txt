    "the cdf diffractive physics program relies on two miniplug ( mp ) calorimeters , which can detect both charged and neutral particles , to measure the event energy flow in the very forward rapidity region on opposite sides of the interaction point .",
    "the performance of a mp prototype is published in @xcite , while the final detector assembly and the results from a cosmic ray test are reported in @xcite .",
    "the mps consist of alternating layers of lead plates and liquid scintillator read out by _ wavelength shifting _ ( wls ) fibers ( fig .  [",
    "fig : routing ] ) .",
    "the fibers are perpendicular to the lead plates and parallel to the proton / antiproton beams , and are read out by _ multi - channel photomultiplier tubes _",
    "( mcpmts ) .",
    "the 16-channel hamamatsu r5900 mcpmts have a quartz window which improves the radiation hardness .",
    "each mp is housed in a cylindrical steel vessel 26@xmath2 in diameter and has a 5@xmath2 hole concentric with the vessel to accommodate the beam pipe .",
    "the depth of a mp is 32 radiation lengths and 1.3 interaction lengths .",
    "the short hadronic depth limits the lateral spread of the showers .",
    "the mps have a novel _ towerless _ geometry with no dead regions , due to the lack of internal boundaries , and towers are formed by combining the desired number of fibers .",
    "the centroid of the tower pulse height provides the position of the shower initiating particle .",
    "the tower design is based on an hexagon geometry .",
    "holes in the lead plate are conceptually grouped in hexagons , each with six holes .",
    "the six fibers inserted in the holes of a hexagon are grouped together and are viewed by one mcpmt channel .",
    "[ fig : routing ]    a seventh fiber , which is clear and carries the light from a calibration led , is also read out by each mcpmt pixel to allow a periodical monitoring of the mcpmt response .",
    "the mcpmt outputs are added to form 84 calorimeter towers per mp , organized in four concentric rings around the beam pipe .",
    "the entire mcpmt can also be read out through the last dynode output to provide trigger information .",
    "each mp has a total of 18 trigger towers , arranged in three rings .",
    "cosmic ray muons were used to test one 60@xmath3 wedge of the east mp .",
    "the cosmic ray trigger fired on a 2-fold coincidence of scintillation counter paddles located on top and at the bottom of the mp vessel , placed with towers pointing upward .",
    "the single photoelectron response was measured using a randomly gated signal from a @xmath4 source .",
    "the response to a minimum ionizing particle was found to be above 100 photoelectrons , exceeding the design specifications .",
    "although a precise energy calibration is not crucial to the analysis of diffractive processes , an attempt was made to estimate the energy of jets and particles using colliding beam data from run ii .",
    "for each tower , the adc count distribution of a sample of minimum bias events can be fitted well by a falling exponential curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slopes ] , top ) .",
    "a monte carlo simulation was then used to calibrate the pseudorapidity dependence of the tower - by - tower response . due to pile - up effects at larger rapidity regions , a luminosity dependence of the adc count distribution slope",
    "is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slopes ] , bottom ) .",
    "a linear fit describes well the data , with the slope decreasing with increasing values of instantaneous luminosity .",
    "the particle multiplicity is measured by counting clusters of towers with energy above noise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lego ] ) ."
