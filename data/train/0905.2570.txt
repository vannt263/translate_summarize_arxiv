    "brightness fluctuations of the uv - optical continuum emission of quasars were recognised shortly after the initial discovery of the objects in the 1960s @xcite . although several programmes were undertaken to monitor these fluctuations , little is yet known about their nature or origin .",
    "a large number of these have focused on comparison of the optical variability with that in other wavebands and less on long - timescale , high temporal resolution optical monitoring .",
    "many studies have searched for oscillations on the @xmath3 day timescale in an attempt to constrain the inner structure size ( eg @xcite ) .",
    "this report , however , is concerned with variability on the year timescale to evidence global quasar structure .    in a model proposed by elvis @xcite to unite the various spectroscopic features associated with different `` types '' of quasars and agn ( eg broad absorption lines , x - ray / uv warm absorbers , broad blue - shifted emission lines )",
    ", the object s outer accretion disc has a pair of bi - conical extended narrow emission line regions in the form of outflowing ionised winds . absorption and emission lines and the so - called warm absorbers result from orientation effects in observing these outflowing winds . supporting evidence for this",
    "is provided by a correlation between polarisation and broad absorption lines found by @xcite .",
    "outflowing accretion disc winds are widely considered to be a strong candidate for the cause of feedback ( for a discussion of the currently understood properties of feedback see @xcite ) .",
    "several models have been developed @xcite to simulate these winds .",
    "@xcite discusses different launch mechanisms for the winds - specifically the balance between magnetic forces and radiation pressure - but finds no preference for one or the other , while @xcite discusses the effect of rotation and finds that a rotating wind has a larger thermal energy flux and lower mass flux , making a strong case for these winds as the source of feedback .",
    "the outflow described by @xcite is now usually identified with the observationally - invoked `` dusty torus '' around agn @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated for the macho quasars that there is no detectable lag time between the v and r variability in quasars , which can be interpreted as demonstrating that all of the optical continuum variability originates in the same region of the quasar .",
    "@xcite observed the gravitationally lensed quasar q0957 + 561 to measure the time delay between the two images and measure microlensing effects . in doing so",
    ", they found a series of autocorrelation subpeaks initially attributed to either microlensing or accretion disc structure .",
    "these results were then re - interpreted by @xcite as elvis outflowing winds at a distance of @xmath4 from the quasar s central compact object .",
    "a model applied by @xcite to the quasar q2237 + 0305 , to simulate microlensing , found that the optimal solution for the system was one with a central bright source and an extended structure with double the total luminosity of the central source , though the outer structure has a lower surface brightness as the luminosity is emanating from a larger source , later determined by @xcite to lie at @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite continued on to argue that since magnetic fields can cause both jets and outflows , they therefore must be the dominant effect in agn .",
    "@xcite however pointed out that the magnetic field required to power the observed elvis outflows is too great to be due to the accretion disc alone .",
    "they therefore argue that all quasars and agn have an intrinsically magnetic central compact object , which they refer to as a meco , as proposed by @xcite , based upon solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations by @xcite .",
    "one compelling aspect to this argument is that it predicts a power - law relationship between elvis outflow radius and luminosity , which was found in work by kaspi et al @xcite and updated by bentz et al @xcite , if one assumes the source of quasar broad emission lines to be outflow winds powered by magnetic fields .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite results were in fact empirically derived for agn of @xmath6 and @xcite postulates that there may be some evolution of this relation with luminosity ( and indeed one might expect some time - evolution of quasar properties which may further modify this scaling relation ) so generalising these results to quasars may yet prove a fallacy .",
    "the radius of the broad line region was found to scale initially by @xcite as @xmath7 , while @xcite found @xmath8 .",
    "another strength of the meco argument is that while @xcite found quasar properties to be uncorrelated using the current standard black hole models , @xcite and @xcite found a homogeneous population of quasars using the @xcite model .",
    "@xcite used microlensing observations of 10 quadruply - lensed quasars , 9 of which were of known redshift including q2237 + 0305 , to demonstrate that standard thin accretion disc models , such as the widely - accepted shakura - sunyaev ( s - s ) disc @xcite , underestimate the optical continuum emission region thickness by a factor of between 3 and 30 , finding an average calculated thickness of @xmath9 , while observed values average @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite found a radius of the broad line region for the seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 of just under 13 light days when the average of several spectral line reverberations were taken , corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "when the scaling of @xcite and @xcite is taken into account , the @xcite result is comparable to the @xcite and @xcite results ( assuming @xmath12 , then @xcite would predict a quasar @xmath13 of approximately @xmath14 ) . also , given that black hole radius scales linearly with mass , as does the predicted radius of the inner edge of the accretion disc , a linear mass-@xmath13 relationship might also be expected .",
    "given calculated seyfert galaxy black hole masses of order @xmath15 and average quasar masses of order @xmath16 , this would scale the seyfert galaxy @xmath13 up to @xmath17 . while these relations are not self - consistent , either of them may be found consistent with the existing quasar structure sizes .",
    "@xcite also found structure on size scales of @xmath18 from microlensing of sdss j1004 + 4112 which would then scale to @xmath19 .",
    "these studies combined strongly evidence the presence of the elvis outflow at a radial distance of approximately @xmath20 from the central source in quasars which may be detected by their reverberation of the optical continuum of the central quasar source .",
    "the @xcite result is also in direct conflict with the s - s accretion disc model , which has been applied in several unsuccessful attempts to describe microlensing observations of q2237 .",
    "first a simulation by @xcite used the s - s disc to model the microlensing observations but predicted a large microlensing event that was later observed not to have occurred .",
    "@xcite then attempted to apply the s - s disc in a new simulation but another failed prediction of large - amplitude microlensing resulted .",
    "another attempt to simulate the q2237 light curve by @xcite produced the same large - amplitude microlensing events .",
    "these events are an inherent property of the s - s disc model where all of the luminosity emanates from the accretion disc , hence causing it all to be lensed simultaneously . only by separating the luminosity into multiple regions , eg two regions ,",
    "one inner and one outer , as in @xcite , can these erroneous large - amplitude microlensing events be avoided .",
    "previous attempts have been made to identify structure on the year timescale , including structure function analysis by trevese et al @xcite and by hawkins @xcite .",
    "@xcite found strong anticorrelation on the @xmath21 year timescale but no finer structure - this is unsurprising as their results were an average of the results for multiple quasars taken at low temporal resolution , whereas the size scales of the elvis outflow winds should be dependant on various quasar properties which differ depending on the launch mechanism and also should be noticed on smaller timescales than their observations were sensitive to .",
    "@xcite also found variations on the @xmath22-year timescale again with poor temporal resolution but then put forth the argument that the variation was found to be redshift - independant and therefore was most likely caused by gravitational microlensing .",
    "however @xcite demonstrated that microlensing occurs on much shorter timescales and at much lower luminosity amplitudes than these long - term variations .",
    "@xcite used structure function analysis to infer size scales for quasar accretion discs but again encountered the problem of too infrequent observations . in this paper and @xcite it was argued that fourier power specra are of more use in the study of quasars , which were then used in @xcite to interpret quasar variability .",
    "however , since reverberation is not expected to be periodic , fourier techniques are not suited to its detection .",
    "hawkins observations of long - timescale variability were recognised in @xcite as a separate phenomenon to the reverberation expected from the elvis model ; this long - term variability remains as - yet unexplained .",
    "hawkins work proposed this variation to be indicative of a timescale for accretion disc phenomena , while others explained it simply as red noise .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that there is a correlation between the optical and x - ray variability in some but not all agn , arguing that x - ray reprocessing in the accretion disc is a viable source of the observed variability , combined with viscous processes in the disc which would cause an inherent mass - timescale dependance , as in the s - s disc the temperature at a given radius is proportional to mass@xmath23 . in this case",
    "a red - noise power spectrum would describe all quasar variability .",
    "for the purposes of this report however , the s - s disc model is regarded as being disproven by the @xcite and @xcite results in favour of the elvis outflow model and so the temperature - mass relation is disregarded . a later investigation @xcite demonstrated that the correlation between x - ray and optical variability can not be explained by simple reprocessing in an optically thick disc model with a corona around the central object .",
    "this lends further support to the assumption that the @xcite model of quasars is indeed viable .",
    "@xcite demonstrated from fourier power spectra that shorter - duration brightness events in quasars statistically have lower amplitudes but again their temporal resolution was too low to identify reverberation on the expected timescales . also as previously discussed , non - periodic events are extremely difficult to detect with fourier techniques .",
    "all of these works are biased by the long - term variability recognised by @xcite as problematic in qso variability study .",
    "a survey by @xcite proposed that quasars could be identified by their variability on this timescale but the discovery by @xcite that long - timescale variation is not quite a universal property of quasars somewhat complicates this possibility .",
    "the spread of variability amplitudes is also demonstrated in @xcite for 44 quasars observed at the wise observatory .",
    "the @xcite observations are also of low temporal resolution and uncorrected for long - term variability thus preventing the detection of reverberation patterns .",
    "this project therefore adopts the @xcite and @xcite model of quasars consisting of a central compact , luminous source with an accretion disc and outflowing winds of ionised material with double the intrinsic luminosity of the central source .",
    "the aim is to search for said winds via reverberation mapping .",
    "past investigations such as @xcite have attempted reverberation mapping of quasars but have had large gaps in their data , primarily due to the fact that telescope time is usually allocated only for a few days at a time but also due to seasonal dropouts .",
    "observations on long timescales , lacking seasonal dropouts and with frequent observations are required for this purpose , to which end the macho programme data have been selected .",
    "past results would predict an average radius of the wind region of order @xmath20 .",
    "the assumption will be made that all structure on timescales in the region of @xmath24 is due to reverberation and that the reverberation process is instantaneous .",
    "the aim is simply to verify whether this simplified version of the model is consistent with observation , not to compare the model to other models .",
    "reverberation mapping is a technique whereby structure size scales are inferred in an astrophysical object by measuring delay times from strong brightness peaks to subsequent , lower - amplitude peaks .",
    "the subsequent peaks are then assumed to be reflections ( or absorptions and re - emissions ) of the initial brightness feature by some external structure ( eg the dusty torus in agn , accretion flows in compact objects ) .",
    "reverberation mapping may be used to study simple continuum reflection or sources of specific absorption / emission features or even sources in entirely different wavebands , by finding the lag time between a brightness peak in the continuum and a subpeak in the emission line or waveband of interest .",
    "this technique has already been successfully applied by , among many others , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when looking for continuum reverberation one usually makes use of the autocorrelation function , which gives the mean amplitude , in a given light curve , at a time @xmath25 relative to the amplitude at time @xmath26 .",
    "the amplitude of the autocorrelation is the product of the probability of a later brightening event at dt with the relative amplitude of that event , rendering it impossible to distinguish by autocorrelation alone , eg a 50% probability of a 50% brightening from a 100% probability of a 25% brightening , since both will produce the same mean brightness profile .",
    "the mathematical formulation of this function is : @xmath27 where i(t ) represents the intensity at a time t relative to the mean intensity , such that for a dimming event i(t ) is negative .",
    "hence @xmath28 becomes negative if a brightening event at t is followed by a dimming event at @xmath29 or if a dimming event at t is followed by a brightening event at @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the standard deviation of i - in rigorous mathematics the @xmath32 term is in fact the product of the standard deviations for i(t ) and i(@xmath25 ) but since they are idential in this case , @xmath32 may be used .",
    "the nature of the autocorrelation calculation also has a tendancy to introduce predicted brightness peaks unrelated to the phenomena of interest .",
    "given autocorrelation peaks at lag times @xmath33 and @xmath34 , a third peak will also be created at lag @xmath35 , of amplitude @xmath36 , which is then divided by the number of data points in the brightness record .",
    "the macho survey operated from 1992 to 1999 , observing the magellanic clouds for gravitational lensing events by massive compact halo objects - compact objects in the galactic halo , one of the primary dark matter candidates .",
    "the programme was undertaken from the mount stromlo observatory in australia , where the magellanic clouds are circumpolar , giving brightness records free from seasonal dropouts .",
    "information on the equipment used in the programme can be found at http://wwwmacho.anu.edu.au/ or in @xcite .",
    "59 quasars were within the field of view of this programme and as a result highly sampled light curves for all of these objects were obtained .",
    "these quasars were observed over the duration of the programme in both v and r filters .",
    "the brightness records for the 59 quasars in both v and r filters are freely available at http://www.astro.yale.edu/mgeha/macho/ while the entire macho survey data are available from http://wwwmacho.anu.edu.au/data/machodata.html .",
    "throughout this study the following assumptions were made :    1 .   that all autocorrelation structure on the several hundred day timescale was due to reverberation from the elvis outflows , which are also the source of the broad emission lines in quasars .",
    "we denote the distance to this region as @xmath13 - the `` radius of the broad line region '' .",
    "2 .   that the timescale for absorption and re - emission of photons was negligable compared to the light travel time from the central source to the outflow surface .",
    "3 .   that the internal structure variable was less than @xmath37 for all objects as found by @xcite and @xcite . note that an internal structure variable of @xmath38 and inclination angle of @xmath39 can not be distinguished by autocorrelation alone from an internal structure variable of @xmath40 with an inclination angle of @xmath41 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "the assumed low @xmath38 is further justified by the fact that the @xcite model predicts the winds to be projected at an angle of @xmath42 from the accretion disc plane , contraining @xmath43 as the reverberating surfaces must lie at lower inclinations if they are in fact part of the outflow structure .",
    "4 .   that extinction was negligable for all objects .",
    "reliable extinction maps of the magellanic clouds are not available and information about the quasars host galaxies is also unavailable so extinction calculations are not possible .",
    "this assumption should be reasonable as any extinction would have a noticeable impact on the colour of the quasar ( given the accepted relation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the colour excess and @xmath46 is the v absorption ) .",
    "first a series of predictions were made for the relative luminosities of the 59 quasars in the sample using their redshifts ( presented in @xcite ) and apparent magnitudes , combined with the mean quasar sed presented in @xcite .",
    "two estimates were produced for these , one for the v data and one for the r data .",
    "this calculation was of interest as it would predict the expected ratios of @xmath13 between the objects in our sample via the @xcite and @xcite relations .",
    "these relations are so far only applied to nearby agn and so this investigation was carried out to test their universality .",
    "firstly , the apparent magnitudes were converted to flux units via the equation @xmath47 where m is the apparent magnitude and f the flux .",
    "then the redshifts of the objects were used to calculate their distances using the tool at + http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/  elenc / calculators / redshift.php with @xmath48 . using this distance and the relation @xmath49 where l is the luminosity , f the flux and d the distance ,",
    "the luminosity of each source in the observed waveband was calculated .",
    "it was recognised , however , that simply taking the ratio between these luminosities was not a fair representation of the ratio of their absolute luminosities as cosmological redshift would cause the observed region of the quasar spectrum to shift with distance and the luminosity varies over the range of this spectrum .",
    "hence the mean quasar sed of @xcite was used to convert the observed luminosities of the objects to expected luminosities at a common frequency - in this case 50 ghz .",
    "these values were then divided by the minimum calculated luminosity so that their relative values are presented in table 1 . for this purpose",
    "it was assumed that the spectral shape of the quasar is independant of bolometric luminosity .",
    "next a calculation was made to predict the dependance of the reverberation pattern of a quasar on its orientation to the observer s line of sight .",
    "this was produced using the geometric equations initially presented in @xcite but reformulated to become more general .",
    "@xcite discusses `` case 1 '' and `` case 2 '' quasars with different orientations - `` case 1 '' being where the nearest two outflow surfaces lie on the near side of the accretion disc plane and `` case 2 '' being where the nearest two surfaces are on the near side of the rotation axis .",
    "these equations become generalised by recognising that the two cases are in fact degenerate and from reverberation alone one can not distinguish a @xmath50 internal structure variable in `` case 1 '' from a @xmath51 internal structure variable in `` case 2 '' .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 . for the purposes of fig .",
    "1 , the @xcite interpretation of @xmath38 is adopted but later it will be demonstrated that in fact there are several possible meanings of @xmath38 , though this degeneracy is the same for all interpretations .",
    "the generalisation is then @xmath52 @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55    this prediction could later be compared to the macho observations .",
    "a value of @xmath38 was not inserted until the project had produced results , so that the mean calculated value of @xmath38 could be inserted into the simulation for comparison with the results .    in the data analysis",
    "it was quickly noticed that one of the 59 macho quasars - macho 42.860.123 - was very poorly observed by the survey , totalling only 50 observations over the programme s seven - year lifetime .",
    "the v and r data for the remaining objects were processed in idl to remove any 10-@xmath31 data points ",
    "5-@xmath31 would seem a more appropriate value at first glance , but inspection of the data showed relevant brightness peaks between 5- and 10-@xmath31 . at the same time",
    "all null entries ( nights with no observation ) were also removed .",
    "the data were then interpolated to give a uniformly - spaced brightness record over time , with the number of bins to interpolate over equal to the number of observations .",
    "the case was made for using a fixed number of bins for all objects , eg 1000 , but for some data records as few as 250 observations were made and so such an interpolation would serve only to reinforce any remaining spurious points . by the employed method",
    ", a small amount of smoothing of the data was introduced .",
    "the data then had their timescales corrected for cosmological redshift to ensure that all plots produced and any structure inferred were on proper timescales .    in the beginning of the project , to understand the behaviour of the data and appreciate the complexities and difficulties of the investigation ,",
    "a list was compiled of the most highly - sampled ( @xmath56 observations ) quasars , yielding 30 objects .",
    "each of these objects had their light curves and autocorrelations examined and a key feature presented itself immediately ; the data showed in some cases a long - timescale ( @xmath57 proper days ) , large - amplitude ( @xmath58 magnitude ) variation that dominated the initial autocorrelation function .",
    "since this variation was seen only in some quasars ( and is on a longer timescale than the predicted reverberation ) , this signal was removed by applying a 300-day running boxcar smooth algorithm over the data , before subtracting this smoothed data ( which would now be low - frequency variation dominated ) from the actual brightness record .",
    "the timescale for smoothing was determined by examination of the brightness profiles of the objects , which showed deviations from this long - timescale signature on timescales below 300 days .",
    "autocorrelation analysis of the uncorrected data also found the first autocorrelation minimum to lie before 300 days .",
    "further , if the central brightness pulse has a duration beyond 300 days it will be extremely difficult ( if even possible ) to resolve the delay to the first reverberation peak , which is expected to be at a maximum lag time of several hundred days .",
    "the new autocorrelation calculations for the long - term variability - corrected data showed from visual inspection the autocorrelation patterns expected from reverberation .",
    "however , as is described in section 2 , the presence of autocorrelation peaks alone do not necessarily constitute a detection of reverberation .    to determine the reality of the autocorrelation peaks , a routine was written to identify the ten largest - amplitude brightening and fading events in each",
    "low - pass filtered brightness record and produce the mean brightness profiles following them - a mean brightening profile and a mean dimming profile .",
    "inspection of these brightness profiles demonstrated that any spurious autocorrelation peaks were a small effect , easily removed by ignoring any peaks within one hundred days of a larger - amplitude peak .",
    "the justification for this is simple - if two reverberations occur within one hundred days of each other ( which has a low probability of occurence when one considers the required quasar orientation ) , resolving them within the brightness record or autocorrelation will become difficult , particularly for the most poorly - sampled , low - redshift objects with a time resolution of @xmath59 days and given that the average half - width of a central brightness peak was found to be approximately 70 days .",
    "there is also the consideration of the shape of the reverberation signal from each elliptical surface , which has not yet been calculated but may have differing asymmetry for each of the four surfaces .",
    "finally it was noticed that the brightening and dimming profiles do not perfectly match and in some cases seem to show structure of opposing sign on the same timescales - if a brightening event was usually followed by another brightening event at a time lag @xmath26 , a dimming event was sometimes also followed by a brightening event at a lag of @xmath26 .",
    "the fact that this effect is not seen in every object makes it difficult to interpret or even identify as a real effect .",
    "the result of this is that the mean brightness profile does not always perfectly match the autocorrelation , but usually demonstrates the same approximate shape .",
    "these arguments are not quantifiable and so are discarded from future investigation , which will focus on the results of an automated analysis . at this point",
    "it was also noted that the highest - redshift quasar in the survey , macho 208.15799.1085 at a redshift of 2.77 , contained only @xmath60 proper days worth of observations .",
    "it was felt that this would not be sufficient time to observe a significant number of reverberation events , which were observed to occur on timescales of order @xmath61 proper days , and so the object was discarded from further analysis .",
    "2 gives one example of the manually - produced light curves , its autocorrelation and the effect of long - term variability .",
    "in the automatically - processed , long - term variability - corrected data , reverberation patterns were recognised in the autocorrelation by an idl routine designed to smooth the autocorrelation on a timescale of 50 days and identify all positive peaks with lags less than 1000 days .",
    "if two or more peaks were identified within 100 days of each other , the more prominent peak was returned . as a result",
    ", we estimate the accuracy of any reverberation signatures to be approximately 50 days . therefore a 50-day smooth will reduce the number of peaks for the program to sort through while not detracting from the results , simultaneously removing any double - peaks caused by dips in autocorrelation caused by unrelated phenomena .",
    "the 50-day resolution simply reflects the fact that the occurence of two peaks within one hundred days can not be identified with two separate reverberations .",
    "this technique was also applied to a brownian noise or simple red noise simulation with a spectral slope of -2 for comparison .",
    "this was generated using a random number generator in the following way .",
    "first an array ( referred to as r ) of n random numbers was produced and the mean value subtracted from each number in said array . a new , blank array ( s ) of length n+1",
    "was created , with values then appended as follows : @xmath62 > 0 \\mbox { then } s[i + 1 ] = s[i ] + 1\\ ] ] @xmath62 < 0 \\mbox { then } s[i + 1 ] = s[i ] - 1\\ ] ]    the seeds for the random number generator were taken as the raw data for each quasar in each filter , so that 114 different simulations were produced to aid in later comparison with results .",
    "@xcite outline a method for producing more rigorous red noise simulations of different spectral slopes but to allow more time to focus on the observations and their interpretation , only this simplified calculation was performed .",
    "basic white noise simulations were also produced but produced none of the predicted autocorrelation structure and so were only followed through the early data processing stages . an example white noise autocorrelation is given in fig .",
    "3 with a quasar autocorrelation curve overplotted .",
    "4 shows the light curve and autocorrelation function for a star observed by the macho programme compared to one of the quasars to demonstrate the difference in autocorrelation function and demonstrate that the observed structure is a feature of the quasars themselves and not induced by observational effects .",
    "once the data were processed and autocorrelation peaks identified , the positions of the peaks were then used to calculate the radial distance from central source to outflow region ( @xmath13 ) , the inclination angle of the observer s line of sight from the accretion disc plane ( @xmath39 ) and a factor termed the internal structure variable which is the angle from the accretion disc plane to the reverberating outflow regions ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "these are calculated from equations ( 2 - 5 ) .",
    "these can then produce @xmath63 or @xmath64 @xmath65 or @xmath66 @xmath67 or @xmath68    from ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) we then obtain @xmath69 @xmath70    consideration of the geometry involved also shows that three special cases must be considered .",
    "first is the case where @xmath71 . in this case ,",
    "peaks two and three are observed at the same time and so only three distinct brightness pulses are seen . in analysing the data ,",
    "the simplifying assumption was made that all 3-peak autocorrelation signatures were caused by this effect .",
    "another case to be considered is when @xmath72 , in which cases pulses 1 and 2 are indistinguishable , as are pulses 3 and 4 .",
    "again , the assumption was made that all two - peak reverberation patterns were caused by this orientation effect .",
    "notice that in these cases the equation for @xmath13 is not modified , but the equations for @xmath38 in the 3-peak and 2-peak cases become @xmath73 @xmath74 respectively .",
    "finally there is the case of zero inclination angle , where peaks one and two arrive at the same time as the initial brightening event , followed by peaks three and four which then arrive simultaneously . in this situation",
    "no information about the internal structure variable can be extracted .",
    "thankfully , no such events were observed .",
    "the results calculated for the 57 studied quasars , from equations ( 10 ) and ( 13 - 16 ) , are presented in table 1 .",
    "the redshifts presented in table 1 are as given in @xcite .",
    "additionally a column has been included showing @xmath13 in multiples of the minimum measured @xmath13 for comparison with the relative luminosities of the quasars .",
    "this yields an average @xmath13 of 544 light days with an rms of 74 light days and an average @xmath38 of @xmath75 with an rms of @xmath2 . a plot of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 as a function of @xmath39 for the 57 objects",
    "was then compared to the predictions of a simulation using the calculated average @xmath38 from these observations , for the data from both filters .",
    "this entire process was then repeated for the red noise simulations , of which 114 were produced such that the resulting plots could be directly compared .",
    "the simulations produced by the r data were treated as r data while the simulations produced by v data were treated as v data , to ensure the simulations were treated as similarly to the actual data as possible .",

    "is present in the calculation of @xmath35 , @xmath84 , etc .",

    "is found to be @xmath92 - sufficiently low to justify the small angle approximation .",

    "for this reason , the calculated inclination angles are inherently uncertain .",
    "the contribution to the rms of @xmath38 is surprisingly small for the two- and three - peak objects .",

    ", one autocorrelation peak was found in the v data while three were found in the r. inspection of the data themselves showed that the r data was much more complete and so the v result for this object was discarded .",
    "the mean deviation of the r or v data from their average was found to be 44 days , giving an error on the mean due to the r / v agreement of @xmath98 days .",
    "the mean deviation of the calculated @xmath39 due to the r / v agreement is @xmath99 and that for @xmath38 is @xmath100 , yielding an error in @xmath38 due to the difference in r and v autocorrelation functions of @xmath101 .",
    "the rms deviation of the observed lag times from those predicted by a model with internal structure variable @xmath102 is found to be @xmath103 , which is acceptable given a systematic error of @xmath93 and an rms in the calculated @xmath38 of @xmath2 .",
    "combining the two errors on each of the mean @xmath13 and @xmath38 yields total errors on their means of @xmath104 light days and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath38 is not entirely clear - it is presented in @xcite as the angle made by the luminous regions of the outflowing winds from the accretion disc .",
    "however , as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "6a , @xmath38 may in fact represent the projection angle of the shadow of the accretion disc onto the outflowing winds if the central luminosity source occupies a region with a radius lower than the disc thickness , thus giving by geometry the ratio of the inner accretion disc radius to the disc thickness .",
    "if the central source is extended above and below the accretion disc , however , then @xmath38 may represent , as shown in fig .",
    "6b , the ratio of disc thickness to @xmath13 .",
    "there may also be a combination of effects at work .",
    "an accurate way of discriminating between these two interpretations may be found by analysing the mean reverberation profiles from the four outflow surfaces and producing a relation between the timing of the central reverberation peak and that of the onset of reverberation by a specific outflow surface .",
    "the two figures above demonstrate how the timing of reverberation onset is interpreted in the two cases of compact vs extended central source but to discriminate , models must be produced of the expected reverberation profiles for these two cases .",
    "results from @xcite would predict the former , as indeed would @xcite and @xcite and so figure 6a would seem favourable , though analysis of the reverberation profiles will enable a more concrete determination of the meaning of @xmath38",
    ". models may then be produced of the expected brightness patterns for differing outflow geometries and compared to the observed light curves to determine the curvature and projection angles of the outflows .",
    "the calculated luminosities may now be compared to the calculated @xmath13 for this sample to determine whether the @xcite or @xcite relations hold for quasars .",
    "7 demonstrates that there is absolutely no correlation found for this group of objects .",
    "this is not entirely unsurprising as even for nearby agn both @xcite and @xcite had enormous scatters in their results , though admittedly not as large as those given here .",
    "one important thing to note is that given a predicted factor 200 range in luminosity , one might take @xcite as a lower limit on the expected spread , giving a predicted range of @xmath13 of approximately a factor 15 .",
    "the sensitivity range of this project in @xmath13 is a function of the inclination angle of the quasar but in theory the @xmath13 detectable at zero inclination would be 500 light days with a minimum detectable @xmath13 at this inclination of 50 light days .",
    "this factor 10 possible spread of course obtains for any inclination angle giving possibly an infinite spread of @xmath13 . for the calculated rms of 77 light days ,",
    "the standard deviation is 10.2 light days , 2% of the calculated mean .",
    "the probability of not finding a factor 15 range of @xmath13 if it exists is therefore less than 1% .",
    "therefore it can be stated to high confidence that this result demonstrates that the @xcite and @xcite results do not hold for quasars .",
    "the failure of @xcite for this data set is evident from the fact that it predicts an even larger spread in @xmath13 than @xcite which is therefore even less statistically probable from our data .",
    "it is possible that this is a failure of the sed of @xcite , that there are some as - yet unrecognised absorption effects affecting the observations or that the assumption of negligable absorption / re - emission times is incorrect but the more likely explanation would seem to be that no correlation between @xmath13 and luminosity exists for quasars .",
    "( the relative @xmath13 ) and @xmath106 ( the relative luminosity ) , demonstrating that the @xcite and @xcite results do not hold for quasars .",
    "the error bars are so small that they are contained within the data points . ]",
    "a calculated average @xmath13 of 544 light days corresponds to @xmath107 , compared to the predicted average of @xmath108 .",
    "the value found here is in remarkable agreement with those previously calculated , made even more surprising by the fact that so few results were available upon which to base a prediction .",
    "many quasar models predict a large variation in quasar properties , see for example @xcite , so we conclude that quasars and perhaps agn in general are an incredibly homogeneous population .",
    "brightness records of 57 quasars taken from the macho survey in r and v colour filters have been analysed to show the presence of autocorrelation structure consistent with biconic outflowing winds at an average radius of @xmath0 light days with an rms of 74 light days .",
    "an internal structure variable of @xmath109 was found , with an rms of @xmath110 .",
    "the accuracy of the program designed to determine the timing of the reverberation peaks limited its temporal resolution to 100 days , resulting in the quoted systematic errors in the mean values calculated . with longer - timescale ,",
    "more regularly sampled data this temporal resolution can be improved - this may also be achieved with more sophisticated computational techniques combined with brightness models not available in this project .",
    "the correlations between radius of the broad emission line region and luminosity found by @xcite and @xcite for nearby agn do not appear to hold for quasars .",
    "this may be indicative of some time or luminosity evolution of the function as no redshift - independant correlation is found in this data set . if there is some relation it is more likely to be time - evolving since any luminosity dependance would most likely be noticeable in fig .",
    "7 , which it is not .",
    "the presence of reverberation in 57 of the 57 quasars analysed implies that the outflowing wind is a universal structure in quasars - a verifiable result since this structure may be identified in regularly - sampled quasars in other surveys .",
    "while it is acknowledged that red noise may yet be responsible for the brightness fluctuations observed , the results are so close to the initial model s prediction that noise seems an unlikely explanation , especially given the corroborating evidence for the theory @xcite .",
    "the continuum variability of quasars , though well observed , is still not well understood .",
    "the results of this study would suggest that an understanding of these fluctuations can only be found by recognising that several physical processes are at work , of which reverberation is of secondary importance in many cases .",
    "it does however appear to be universally present in quasars and possibly in all agn .",
    "given that quasars are defined observationally by the presence of broad , blue - shifted emission lines , of which outflowing winds are the proposed source , this result is strong support for the @xcite model .",
    "several phenomena identified in the macho quasar light curves remain as yet unexplained .    1 .   what is the source of the long - term variability of quasars ?",
    "is it a random noise process or is there some underlying physical interpretation ? it has been suggested that perhaps a relativistic orbiting source of thermal emission near the inner accretion disc edge may be the source of such fluctuation .",
    "modelling of the expected emission from such a source must be undertaken before such a hypothesis can be tested .",
    "why is it that the brightness profile following a dimming event sometimes agrees perfectly with the brightening profile while at other times it is in perfect disagreement ?",
    "again , is this a real physical process ?",
    "work by @xcite on stratified wind models presents a situation where the central object brightening could increase the power of an inner wind , increasing its optical depth and thus shielding outer winds .",
    "this would result in negative reverberation .",
    "further investigation may demonstrate a dependance of this effect on whether the central variation is a brightening or fading .",
    "3 .   what is the mean profile of each reverberation peak ? this profile may yield information about the geometry of the outflowing wind , thus enabling constraints to be placed on the physical processes that originate them .",
    "4 .   can quasars be identified by reverberation alone ? or perhaps by the long - term variability they exhibit ? with surveys such as pan - starrs and lsst on the horizon , there is growing interest in devloping a purely photometric method of identifying quasars .",
    "lsst and pan - starrs will also produce light curves for thousands of quasars which can then be analysed in bulk to produce a higher statistical accuracy for the long - term variability properties of quasars .",
    "it is evident that the sampling rate will only be sufficient for reverberation mapping to be performed with lsst and not pan - starrs .",
    "is there a time- or luminosity - evolving relation between @xmath13 and luminosity ?",
    "comparison of @xmath13 , luminosity and redshift may yet shed light on this question .",
