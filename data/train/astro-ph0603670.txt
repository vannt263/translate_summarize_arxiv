    "supernovae ( sne ) are associated with the deaths of stars , in particular core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are associated with the deaths of massive stars , which have initial masses greater than about 8 .",

    "the plateau subclass of type ii sne ( sne ii - p ) are thought to arise from the explosions of red supergiants ( rsgs ) , which have initial masses greater than 810  and have retained their hydrogen envelopes before core collapse @xcite .    until the discovery of the red supergiant ( rsg ) that exploded as sn  2003gd @xcite , there had been no direct confirmation that sne ii - p did indeed arise from the explosions of rsgs . before this detection",
    "there had been only two other unambiguous detections of type ii progenitors , neither of which fitted the evolutionary scenario that is commonly accepted .",
    "these were the progenitors of the peculiar type ii - p sn  1987a , which was a blue supergiant , and the type iib sn  1993j that arose in a massive interacting binary system @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of sn  2005cs ( ii - p ) in m51 , a galaxy with deep multi - colour pre - explosion images from the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "there have been other extensive attempts to detect progenitors of nearby sne on ground- and space - based archival images e.g. @xcite , which have set upper mass limits mostly on ii - p events .",
    "the low mass of the progenitors discovered and upper limits set has led to the suggestion that sne ii - p come only from rsgs with masses less than about 15@xcite    sn  2004a is another example of a nearby sn ii - p which has _ hst _",

    "sn  2004a appears to be a ` normal ' sn ii - p with a spectrum and light curve very like the well observed sn  1999em ( figs .",
    "[ fig : s04a99em ] and [ fig:04a99em ] ) .",

    "one of the proposed characteristics of this group is a rapid excess in the  and  colours at the end of the photospheric phase @xcite .",
    "and @xcite noted this rapid excess in the ` faint ' sn  1997d ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : c04a99em ] compares the colour evolutions of sn  2004a and sn  1999em .",
    "the  colour evolution of sn  2004a clearly shows such a rapid excess at the end of the plateau , which is not seen in the colour curve of sn  1999em .",
    "[ fig : diffsnc ] shows a comparison of the colour curves of the prototypical peculiar ` faint ' sn  1997d @xcite , and the ` normal ' sne  1999em and 2003gd @xcite .",
    "although the excess is present in the  colour curve of sn  2004a , it does not show as great an excess as sn  1997d , but instead follows a similar curve to sn  2003gd with a slightly bluer tail .",
    "there is too large a scatter in the  colour curve to be of much use , but there does not appear to be any evidence of a colour excess .",
    "the appearance of the spectrum and the light curves imply that sn  2004a is a normal sn ii - p , suggesting that this excess is not confined to the ranks of the ` faint ' sne . until we have a larger sample of sne ii - p , both ` faint ' and ` normal ' , it is difficult to confirm or rule out this as a characteristic .    a comparison between the uvoir light curves of sne  2004a , 2003gd , 1999em , 1999gi and 1997d is shown in fig .  [ fig : uvoir ] .",
    "all the uvoir light curves , apart from sn  2004a , are from @xcite and a full description of how they were constructed can be found there .",
    "the uvoir light curve of sn  2004a , which was constructed in the same way , also confirms the similarities between sn  2004a and the other normal sne ii - p .",
    "sn  2004a differs slightly from sn  1999em in the plateau with sn  2004a being marginally fainter , whereas the tail luminosities reflect the comparable nickel mass ejected .",
    "we compared the observed properties of sn  2004a with the progenitor mass , presented in section [ sec : prog ] , using equation  ( 2 ) of @xcite .",
    "the equations of @xcite relate the explosion energy , mass of the envelope expelled ( ) and initial radius of the star just before the explosion , to the observed quantities of sne .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 14 supernovae to test these equations and found that they gave reasonable results .",
    "equation  ( 2 ) of @xcite , is shown here in equation  ( [ equ : m ] ) , where  is the ejected envelope mass , @xmath15 is the length of the plateau and @xmath16 is the velocity of the photosphere material in the middle of the plateau .",
    "@xmath17    if we consider the uvoir light curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvoir ] , the length of the plateau is @xmath1880d , although it is difficult to be confident as the sn was not observed close to explosion .",
    "we therefore estimate the length of the plateau to be @xmath19d , where the positive error is very conservative . using the reddening estimated in section  [ sec : red ] , the parameters discussed in section  [ sec : scm ] for the scm at 50d post explosion and the distance estimated in section  [ sec : d ]",
    ", we found that the ejecta mass was @xmath20 .",
    "if we assume that the compact remnant plus other mass losses from the system is @xmath21 then it suggests that @xmath22  for sn  2004a , where the upper mass limit of 23  is a hard upper limit as the error in the plateau is very conservative .",
    "the lower limit of this is consistent with the progenitor mass , @xmath5 , found from pre - explosion images in section  [ sec : prog ] .",
    "this result may also suggest that equation  ( [ equ : m ] ) overestimates the mass somewhat as the lower limit is only just consistent even though our lower limits are fairly well constrained .",
    "the observations of progenitors do not only have important implications for stellar evolution theory , but also for the progenitor models of ` faint ' sne  ii - p .",
    "there are two very different plausible models for these , one being the low - energy explosion of massive stars ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model",
    "the collapsing core forms a black hole and a significant amount of fallback of material occurs .",
    "an alternative scenario is the low - energy explosion of low - mass stars , presented by who successfully reproduced the observations of sn  1997d with an explosion of @xmath23 ergs and an ejected mass of 6 .",
    "the findings of @xcite support the high - mass progenitor scenario . the authors find a bimodal distribution of sne in the nickel mass ,  plane .",
    "a reproduction of the authors fig .  1 ( right )",
    "is shown here in fig .",
    "[ fig : zamp ] . we are beginning to populate this figure with direct measurements of the main - sequence mass of the progenitors , as opposed to model dependent values .",
    "the most interesting feature of this figure , and the most controversial , is the existence of the faint branch .",
    "the sne which populate this branch are proposed to have high initial mass progenitors .",
    "the points with direct measurements , or robust limits , of progenitor mass from pre - explosion imaging are highlighted with the filled circles .",
    "this figure however should be treated with caution as the theoretical estimates of  from @xcite , shown with open circles in the figure , will most probably need to be revised using the value of the opacity from @xcite .",
    "the observed nickel masses are estimated from the light curves , and are from @xcite for sn  1999br and from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) for sne  2003gd and 1999em .",

    "is from @xcite , whereas sne  1999em and 1999br are upper mass limits only and are from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "sn  2004a comfortably sits in the ` normal ' branch of the bimodal distribution .",
    "even though the mass limit of sn  1999br rules out a high mass progenitor for this ` faint ' sn , it does not necessarily rule out a high mass progenitor scenario for other ` faint ' sne .",
    "it does however suggest that for at least some ` faint ' sne a low mass progenitor is likely . with more upper mass limits or direct detections of the progenitor stars of these sne",
    ", we should be able to determine the validity of the high mass progenitor scenario .",
    "we presented photometric and spectroscopic data of the type ii - p sn  2004a , comparing the _ bvri _ light curves with those of the well observed sn  1999em using a @xmath24-fitting algorithm .",
    "this analysis allowed us to estimate an explosion epoch of jd @xmath25 , corresponding to a date of 2004 january 6 .",
    "we estimated the extinction of the sn as @xmath26 , using _",
    "acs photometry of the neighbouring stars and confirmed the reddening using the sn s colour evolution .",
    "the expansion velocity was measured from our only spectrum , and was found to be comparable to the velocities of similar sne ii - p .",
    "this enabled us to extrapolate the velocity evolution of sn  2004a forwards 7 days to find the velocity at a phase of 50d , to be used in the scm distance estimate .    three new distances to ngc",

    "if the 4.8@xmath6 detection is not believed then the 5@xmath6 upper limit in the f814w images implies a robust upper mass limit for a rsg progenitor of 12 .",
    "this is only the seventh progenitor star of an unambiguous core - collapse sn that has had a direct detection .",
    "the first two progenitors discovered were those of sn  1987a , which was a bsg , and sn  1993j , which arose in a massive interacting binary system .",
    "neither of these fitted in with the theory that rsgs explode to give type ii sne .",
    "however , it appears that the elusive rsg progenitors are now being found , with the discovery of the progenitor of sn  2004a being the third ( after sne 2003gd and 2005cs ) .",
    "the observations of sn  2004a were compared to those of other sne ii - p and were found to be consistent with other normal sne ii - p , although there is a small peak in the uvoir light curve at around 40d , which could just be an artifact of the photometry .",
    "the sn observations were then compared to the mass of the progenitor using theoretical relationships which relate the mass of the envelope expelled to the observed quantities of sne , and were found also to be consistent .",
