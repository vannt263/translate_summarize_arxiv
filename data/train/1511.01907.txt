    "recent observations have convincingly demonstrated that massive stars can experience an eruptive mass loss episode @xmath3 yr before core collapse .",
    "such episodes have been confirmed in h - rich type iin @xcite and h - poor , he - rich type ibn @xcite supernovae .",
    "although the brief timescales between eruption and supernova explosion have been anticipated in special cases of very massive stars @xcite , a growing number of systems are being discovered that fall outside most theoretical regimes and that challenge many long held notions of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "the most favored candidate progenitors of type iin and ibn supernovae are luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars @xcite , and stars leaving the lbv phase and entering a wolf - rayet ( w - r ) phase @xcite that may be exceptionally brief ( @xmath4 yr ; @xcite ) .",
    "lbv stars are prime suspects because they undergo recurrent mass - loss episodes that eject large portions of their hydrogen envelope ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) . however , traditional stellar evolutionary theory has predicted lbv stars to be a transitional phase lasting @xmath6 to @xmath7 yr before evolving to a compact and hydrogen - poor w - r star lasting a few @xmath8 yr @xcite .",
    "this predicted timescale is discrepant with the @xmath3 yr timescale between eruption and core collapse observed in at least some type iin and ibn systems @xcite .",
    "the extent to which eruptive and/or accelerated mass loss may directly precede core collapse in a wider range of supernovae is poorly constrained , particularly in type iib , ib , and ic supernovae ( sn ibc ) where the progenitor star has been significantly stripped of its hydrogen envelope . some insight into this issue was provided by optical @xcite and radio+x - ray observations @xcite of the type iib sn2013df . both studies",
    "concluded that the progenitor star experienced enhanced mass loss of @xmath9 ( for wind velocity of 10 ) in the final centuries leading up to the supernova explosion .",
    "intriguingly , not all type iib supernovae exhibit the same mass loss enhancement ( e.g. , sn2011dh ; @xcite ) .",
    "the underlying physical reasons for this dichotomy are presently unclear , but may be related to the progenitor star size and various channels of binary interaction @xcite .",
    "w - r stars have long been suggested as an obvious progenitor of sn ibc because they are deficient in hydrogen @xcite .",
    "however , only progenitor stars with much cooler atmospheres than those of w - r stars have been unambiguously detected at the explosion sites of type iib supernovae @xcite , and no secure direct identification has yet been made of a type ib or ic progenitor system @xcite .",
    "a possible exception is the type ib iptf13bvn @xcite .",
    "the observed number of w - r stars is probably insufficient to account for all sn ibc , and low mass he stars in binary systems are more likely to be the dominant progenitor channel @xcite .",
    "however , because w - r stars are difficult to detect in broadband images and large populations may presently be unaccounted for @xcite , w - r stars may still represent a significant fraction of sn ibc .",
    "in this paper we present and analyze optical observations of a supernova that underwent a remarkable metamorphosis consistent with a delayed interaction between the core - collapse explosion and a massive circumstellar shell formed from the progenitor star s partially stripped hydrogen envelope . in section [ sec : observations ] , we present multi - epoch spectra of sn2014c that follow its slow spectroscopic transformation from normal type ib to strongly interacting type iin , as well as archival pre - explosion images that show a luminous source coincident with the supernova . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss properties of the partially stripped progenitor star and its host environment , as well as possible physical mechanisms behind the formation of the circumstellar shell .",

    "the day @xmath47 spectrum , which has only narrow components , is most likely a combination of emission local to the supernova and from the entire host massive star cluster ( see section  [ sec : pre - explosion ] ) .",

    "we detect a minor emission peak centered at 8446    in our day 282 spectrum that is blended with the near - infrared triplet .",
    "this feature is most likely the recombination line at 8446   and not .",
    "we also do not observe fe ii lines at 9071 , 9128 , or 9177  , which would be expected to accompany the fe ii @xmath618451 line @xcite .",

    "the strong supernova - csm interaction must have started between february and may of 2014 while the supernova was behind the sun .",
    "type ib supernovae have typical rise times of @xmath102 days @xcite , thus the strong interaction occurred somewhere between @xmath103 20 and 130 days after explosion . assuming a minimum forward shock velocity of @xmath104",
    ", we can loosely constrain the radius of the shell to be @xmath105 cm from the explosion center .    in figure",
    "[ fig : iinibn ] , sn2014c is compared to two representative objects : the type iin sn2005ip @xcite and the type ibn sn2006jc @xcite .",

    "is located nearby and interaction commences shortly ( @xmath106 day ) after explosion .",
    "consequently , an opaque csm hides the interior and o - rich material is often never observed .",
    "this contrasts with sn2014c , where the longer delay between explosion and interaction is associated with a larger , less dense and less opaque shell .",
    "this latter situation is advantageous as it permits observations of interior processes that are normally hidden .",
    "the closest analog to sn2014c in overall properties is sn2001em .",
    "that supernova was spectroscopically classified as a hydrogen deficient type ib / c @xcite , two years before it was re - detected as a highly luminous radio source @xcite , and showed intermediate - width h@xmath0 emission with fwhm @xmath107  in its optical spectra @xcite . unlike sn2014c , the intermediate stages between h - deficient to h - dominated emission in sn2001em was completely missed .",
    "although it was originally thought that sn2001em may harbor a bipolar relativistic off - axis jet that had decelerated to mildly relativistic velocities @xcite , later observations with very long baseline interferometry ruled this model out by demonstrating that the expansion velocity of the supernova was below 6000  and that the supernova was therefore not driven by a relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the multi - wavelength properties of sn 2001em could be modeled in a scenario in which non - relativistic ejecta from the supernova explosion collided with a dense and massive ( @xmath108 ) circumstellar shell at a distance of @xmath109 cm from the star .",
    "the circumstellar shell was presumably formed by a vigorous mass loss episode with a mass loss rate of @xmath110 m@xmath111 yr@xmath35 approximately @xmath112 to @xmath113 yr prior to the supernova explosion .",
    "the hydrogen envelope was completely lost and subsequently swept up by the fast wind of the pre - supernova star and accelerated to a velocity of 30 - 50 .",
    "such a high - rate mass - loss event could be explained by binary interaction , but could also be explained by a powerful eruption from an lbv star .",
    "a similar scenario is possible for sn2014c , but in this case , less of the progenitor s h - rich envelope had been stripped at the time of explosion ( see additional discussion in section [ sec : shell ] ) .",
    "late - time interaction with dense csm shells has been observed in a handful of supernovae with h - rich ejecta .",
    "for example , the progenitor of sn1996cr evacuated a large cavity just prior to exploding , and the forward blast wave likely spent 1 - 2 yr in relatively uninhibited expansion before eventually striking a dense shell of csm @xcite .",
    "sn1996cr may be a `` wild cousin '' of sn1987a , which has slowly interacted with a dense ring at a radius of @xmath114 cm ( approximately an order of magnitude larger than the shell radius inferred for sn2014c ) beginning as early as 1995 @xcite .",
    "our modeling of the near - maximum light optical spectrum of sn2014c associates absorption around 6150    with high velocity hydrogen ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "attempts to model the 6150    absorption with were unsuccessful because the velocity as inferred from the minimum of the feature ( @xmath115 ) was inconsistent with those inferred from all other ions ( @xmath116 , cf .",

    "alternative identifications for this absorption feature that have been investigated elsewhere for other sn ibc , including and @xcite , were ruled out as strong contributors in sn2014c .",
    "our model is consistent with recent work by @xcite , who find that is unlikely to be the dominant contributor to the absorption feature near 6150    seen in many snibc .",
    "the detection of hydrogen absorption around the time of maximum light implies that the progenitor star of sn2014c was only partially stripped of hydrogen at the time of explosion .",
    "this is an important observation because it informs about the evolutionary status of the star at the time of core collapse .",
    "it is also relevant for debates on the extent of h and he in snibc @xcite .",
    "the range of projected doppler velocities used in fitting the optical spectrum with ( @xmath117  ) is consistent with a detached envelope consisting of an extended layer of hydrogen beyond the otherwise fairly sharp photosphere .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to accurately estimate the mass of hydrogen associated with the detached envelope , but the models of @xcite provide useful upper limits .",
    "hachinger et al .",
    "conclude that @xmath118 of hydrogen is sufficient for h@xmath0 absorption to dominate over absorption due to @xmath616355 , as it does in sn2014c .",
    "mass loss in massive stars is correlated with metallicity @xcite .",
    "the oxygen abundance of the explosion site of sn2014c measured from our day @xmath47 spectrum using the @xmath119 scale of @xcite is @xmath120 , which is near the solar value ( @xmath121 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our measurement is consistent with an independent measurement of the oxygen abundance of the center of ngc7331 ( @xmath122 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the explosion site metallicity of sn2014c is above the median metallicity of type ib supernovae with secure classifications , which is @xmath123 @xcite , and in line with the mean metallicity of type iin , which is @xmath124 @xcite ( both measured with the same @xmath119 scale ) .",
    "however , the explosion site metallicity is consistent with the metallicity distribution observed for each class , which are largely overlapping .",
    "sn 2014c was discovered in a targeted survey , which is known to favor the discovery of supernovae in brighter and more metal - rich galaxies @xcite .",
    "valuable information about the progenitor system comes from the subaru and hst pre - explosion imaging ( figures  [ fig : images ] and [ fig : enlarge ] ) .",
    "correcting for extinction using @xmath125 , the absolute magnitude of the coincident source is @xmath126 mag .",
    "the luminosity rivals that of the most luminous stars known , suggesting that the source is not a single star and is instead a massive star cluster . supporting this conclusion are the facts that 1 ) the source is extended and composite in the hst f658n image with an effective radius of @xmath127 pc ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : pre - explosion ] ) that is consistent with observed sizes of massive star clusters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and 2 ) sn2014c has a noticeable offset from the center of the source ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "we compared the photometry and estimate of h@xmath0 luminosity of the pre - explosion source to the binary population and spectral synthesis ( bpass ) stellar population models ( @xcite ; eldridge et al .",
    ", in preparation ; http://bpass.auckland.ac.nz ) .",
    "assuming the total extinction @xmath42 , we find that the best fitting age of the stellar population is between 30 to 300 myr .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0 emission from the pre - explosion source favors younger populations closer to 30 myr , and binary star models match estimates derived from the h@xmath0 luminosity more closely than those derived from single star models .",
    "the turn off mass of stellar populations in the favored age range is between 3.5 to @xmath128 , and the mass of the cluster is estimated to be between @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "these age constraints are the same for three metallicities close to that of the environment of @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where solar metallicity is between @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "a source of uncertainty in our analysis of the host massive star cluster is in our estimate of the foreground extinction .",
    "it is unknown whether the extinction estimated from the day @xmath47 optical spectrum of sn2014c is local to the supernova , or along the line of sight to the entire cluster .",
    "an additional complication is that if the extinction is local , then it is possible that the extinction may have changed with time .",
    "thus , within the stated uncertainties , the uncorrected absolute magnitudes represent lower limits to the luminosity of the cluster .",
    "massive stars are known to become stripped of their outer layers in a variety of ways including line - driven winds and binary interactions @xcite , but the details behind the precise physical mechanisms that are involved and the stages that this mass loss takes place are not well constrained ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "any plausible explanation of the origin of the dense csm shell with which sn2014c interacted must be able to account for two key properties of the system .",
    "one property is the distance of the shell from the progenitor star of sn2014c , which is much more distant than the shells in the majority of type iin and ibn supernovae .",
    "another property is that the progenitor star exploded as a type ib supernova , meaning that it had been largely stripped of its hydrogen envelope at the time of core collapse .",
    "below , we discuss three plausible scenarios for the physical origin of the massive shell that surrounded sn2014c at the time of explosion .",
    "w - r stars have significant stellar winds , with mass loss rates of a few times @xmath134 yr@xmath35 and terminal wind velocities of @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "these winds can run into and overtake the much slower winds ( @xmath62 ) of a previous red supergiant ( rsg ) phase and create massive csm shells , or `` bubbles , '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "approximately half of the galactic population of w - r stars are associated with a csm shell , some of which have anomalous abundances associated with ejected cno - processed stellar material @xcite . however ,",
    "the majority of these csm shells have diameters of many parsecs , which is much larger than the radius of the shell inferred for sn 2014c ( @xmath136 pc ) .",
    "thus , sn2014c did not interact with an environment like those typically observed around w - r stars .    however , it is possible that the progenitor star of sn2014c evolved through a brief w - r phase lasting much less than @xmath6 yr .",
    "although traditionally it has been believed that massive stars should spend @xmath137 myr in the core - he - burning w - r phase before finally exploding as normal sn ibc @xcite , advances in stellar evolution modeling show many pathways that may potentially lead to short - lived w - r stars .",
    "examples include low mass binary stars @xcite , and rsgs with strong pulsation - driven superwinds @xcite . analyses of circumstellar environments around supernova remnants also support the notion that progenitors of stripped - envelope supernovae may pass through brief w - r phases @xcite .",
    "however , a short w - r phase associated with a typical mass loss rate of a few @xmath138 in itself can not explain the massive shell sn2014c interacted with .",
    "though a short w - r phase will sweep up a dense shell close to the star , the shell will not have much mass because the rsg wind was expanding freely at this small radius .",
    "a possible solution is if the short w - r phase was accompanied with an enhanced mass loss rate ( e.g. , @xmath139 ) , which is a scenario proposed by @xcite for sn2001em .",
    "alternatively , in light of the established connection between type iin supernovae and lbv stars , it is plausible that the shell surrounding the sn2014c progenitor system was ejected in a single eruptive event rather than a brief period of enhanced w - r stellar wind .",
    "shell ejections have typical velocities of @xmath140 , which would mean that the major mass loss event would have taken place in the last @xmath141 years prior to core collapse .    providing",
    "the pre - explosion source was a massive star cluster , the most probable turn - off mass range estimated from the bpass models ( @xmath142 ) is too low to be compatible with typical lbv progenitors ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "however , because uncertainties in our fitting allow room for ages as low as 10  myr , an lbv - like progenitor is not ruled out completely .",
    "it is worth noting that the type iin - lbv connection is thus far only robust for stars with h - rich envelopes and to date there is no direct detection of the progenitor star of an interacting h - poor supernova .",
    "indirect arguments that the progenitors of type ibn supernovae exploded in the transition from lbv to w - r phases @xcite , potentially due to instabilities initiated in the final stages of he core burning @xcite , have been advanced .",
    "ejection of an h - rich common envelope in a binary system is also a plausible scenario .",
    "stellar evolution calculations and population models that incorporate stellar duplicity show that stars less than 20 m@xmath111 in interacting binaries can be stripped of their hydrogen envelopes via mass transfer to a companion and/or the loss of the common envelope , and end their lives as low mass helium stars that explode as sn ibc @xcite .",
    "this type of progenitor system was proposed for the type ib iptf13bvn @xcite , which has an optical spectrum at maximum light very similar to that of sn2014c ( see figure  [ fig : syn++ ] ) .",
    "the location of sn2014c s progenitor star within a compact massive star cluster makes it plausible that hot gas from stellar winds and prior supernovae could have provided a large external pressure by which to confine the rsg wind into a shell near the star .",
    "simulations have shown that it is difficult to confine rsg wind to @xmath144 pc with external thermal or ram pressure @xcite , thus this scenario is not plausible unless the wind had considerable asymmetry originating from stellar rotation and/or duplicity @xcite .",
    "a viable alternative scenario is through the process of photoionization - confinement .",
    "@xcite demonstrate how an external radiation field generated by neighboring stars can form a standing shock in the neutral part of an outflowing wind and create an almost static , photoionization - confined shell that traps up to 35 per cent of all mass lost during the rsg phase close to the star until it explodes .",
    "their model was specific to betelgeuse and its @xmath145 circumstellar shell , but the model is applicable to other stars that might have much more massive shells .    complicating this interpretation",
    "is the fact that the progenitor star of sn2014c was h - stripped at the time of explosion and thus no longer in the rsg phase .",
    "if the star evolved through a w - r phase with a typical timescale of @xmath146 yr , the momentum of the winds traveling @xmath147  make it unlikely that a shell @xmath148 in mass with radius @xmath149 cm would have survived .",
    "the photoionization - confined shell scenario remains plausible if the shell was initially much more massive at the end of the rsg phase ( a few @xmath150 ) and/or if the w - r phase was short .",
    "we have presented spectroscopic observations of sn2014c that follow its evolution from an ordinary type ib supernova to an interacting type iin .",
    "our observations are consistent with the supernova having exploded in a cavity before encountering a dense , nearby ( @xmath151 cm ) h - rich shell formed from mass lost from the progenitor star .",
    "we considered three possible origins to the shell : 1 ) a w - r fast wind phase that overtook a slower rsg wind , 2 ) an eruptive ejection , or 3 ) various forms of csm confinement .",
    "we find that all explanations require that the progenitor star experienced a brief @xmath152yr w - r phase .",
    "the brief w - r phase may have been associated with larger - than - normal mass loss rates ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "alternatively , the prior rsg wind may have been distributed asymmetrically and/or confined via a photoionization layer .",
    "our observations disfavor a sudden eruption in an lbv - like event , but do not rule out such a scenario .",
    "ejection of an h - rich common envelope in a binary system is also possible .",
    "we also presented archival subaru and hst pre - explosion images covering the field of sn2014c that show a luminous coincident source .",
    "the sed and source size as measured by hst are both consistent with a compact massive star cluster .",
    "we estimated the age of the cluster to be @xmath1 myr , and favor models incorporating interacting binary systems with ages closer to @xmath2 myr in light of relatively strong h@xmath0 emission .    because extensive archival data of the host galaxy exist , it is possible that a historical light curve could be constructed . such a light curve could be used to look for changes in apparent brightness in the system that may be associated with precursor activity from an unstable massive star ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "notably , sn2013bu was discovered in ngc7331 on 2013 april 21 @xcite , which was only eight months before the discovery of sn2014c .",
    "thus , multi - epoch observations of sn2013bu that cover the region of sn2014c would be appropriate for this type of archival analysis .",
    "we searched for previous hst observations , but unfortunately sn2014c fell slightly outside the footprint except for the f658n images presented here .",
    "future observations can pinpoint the location within the host cluster and investigate the immediate stellar environment when the supernova has faded .",
    "our results strongly motivate observations at ultraviolet wavelengths from which line diagnostics can be performed to investigate potentially enhanced abundances consistent with cno processed material ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is anticipated that additional emission lines will develop as the csm cools over time ( see , e.g. , sn2005ip ; @xcite ) .",
    "line diagnostics at these wavelengths would reveal important information about the evolutionary transitions a massive star may undergo in its final stages approaching core collapse .",
    "sn 2014c is a well - observed example of a class of core - collapse supernovae that fill a gap between events that interact strongly with nearby environments immediately after explosion ( type iin and ibn ) and events that are never observed to interact at all ( the majority of snibc ) .",
    "previous surveys of late - time radio emission from snibc suggest that events like sn2014c are infrequent @xcite .",
    "however , considering that these follow - up observations are not densely sampled and cover many snibc that are @xmath154 mpc , the frequency of other late interaction events where the mass lost is less extreme and/or concentrated at greater distances is unknown .",
    "the shell of mass loss material surrounding the progenitor star of sn2014c was close enough to be detected via subsequent interaction with the blast wave , and yet fortuitously distant enough to permit a clear view of the underlying supernova .",
    "improved constraints on the frequency with which snibc interact with their stripped shells can contribute important information about the final stages of mass loss and stellar evolution .",
    "given that the hydrodynamic instabilities that lead to enhanced pre - supernova mass loss may be related to deviations from spherical symmetry in the progenitor star structure @xcite , understanding how the underlying physical mechanisms may permit a range of pre - supernova mass loss rates and time lags may also help with our understanding of the core collapse process itself .",
