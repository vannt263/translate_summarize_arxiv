    "in studies of chiral symmetry breaking it is desirable to start from an ( almost ) chirally invariant formulation of lattice fermions . at present",
    "this is best realized by using fermions satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation , e.g.  using the overlap operator , or by working with the domain wall framework @xcite . in such approaches wilson fermions",
    "are still important as an input .    for the wilson - dirac operator ( which breaks chiral invariance explicitly ) in @xmath4 lattice qcd",
    "aoki @xcite has predicted that in a certain parameter range there is a phase in which parity and flavor symmetry are both spontaneously broken .",
    "it is separated from an unbroken phase by a line of second order phase transition on which the pion states are expected to become massless @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : proposed_phase_diagram ] the proposed phase diagram is sketched in the .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite it has been pointed out that the features of the aoki phase are of relevance for locality and for restoration of chiral invariance in quenched and full qcd with ginsparg - wilson and domain wall fermions .",
    "accordingly , the region of the aoki phase has to be avoided in such investigations in order not to spoil physical reliability .    in the light of this",
    "it is important to have precise information about the region where the aoki phase really occurs . in the past",
    "it has been questioned @xcite whether the aoki phase exists also at larger @xmath5-values , i.e.  towards the continuum . however , previous investigations of this issue did not lead to a unique answer .",
    "therefore we have addressed this problem again @xcite .    here",
    "we report on results showing that most likely the aoki phase does not exist for at zero temperature .",
    "furthermore , we present data for finite temperature indicating such broken phase still at @xmath2 and connecting it to the finite temperature phase transition .",
    "is the phase where flavor and parity are spontaneously broken .",
    "both symmetries are conserved in regions @xmath6.,height=173 ]",
    "[ fig : extrapolation43 ]    to investigate the aoki phase we have simulated lattice qcd with two flavors of unimproved wilson fermions using the hybrid monte carlo algorithm .",
    "an explicitly symmetry - breaking source term was added to the fermion matrix @xmath7 , @xmath8 since without the added term the order parameter @xmath9 would always be zero on a finite lattice .",
    "then @xmath9 was measured varying the lattice size @xmath10 and the ( non - zero ) @xmath11-values .",
    "the order parameter @xmath12 monitoring spontaneous symmetry breaking is obtained by taking the double limit in the following order @xmath13    for zero temperature the simulations were performed on lattices ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 at @xmath5-values 4.0 , 4.3 , 4.6 , and 5.0 , with @xmath16 and @xmath11 in the intervals @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . for each @xmath5 and each lattice size ( starting on @xmath19 ) the physically relevant values of @xmath16",
    "were determined first , namely the region where @xmath9 has a peak at finite @xmath11 .",
    "[ fig : extrapolation46 ]    this is shown on the left hand sides of figs .",
    "[ fig : extrapolation43 ] and [ fig : extrapolation46 ] .",
    "one sees that for @xmath1 and @xmath2 the crucial values are near @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . at these values",
    "we have increased the lattice sizes until the measurements for different sizes agreed within errors . in this way we achieved that we can treat our largest lattices as infinitely large .",
    "as described in ref .  @xcite a reasonable ansatz to extrapolate the data to @xmath23 is @xmath24 with @xmath25 as a free parameter it describes the data well . indeed , the parameter of interest , @xmath6 , is then robust against the introduction of correction terms linear and quadratic in @xmath11 .    at @xmath1",
    "the parameter @xmath9 has a non - vanishing extrapolation , while at @xmath2 the best fit gives @xmath26 .",
    "combined with similar simulation results at @xmath0 and @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) we confirm the aoki phase at @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the fit parameters @xmath29 and @xmath25 turn out to agree for different @xmath5 within errors ( the values are @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) . at @xmath2",
    "the ansatz also works , but results in a vanishing order parameter .",
    "also at @xmath3 no finite order parameter was found @xcite .",
    "this suggest that the aoki phase ends somewhere near @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram_results ] . the shift in @xmath16 with increasing lattice size ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapolation46 ] ) appears to be related to the end of the symmetry - breaking phase .",
    "is finite , diamonds indicate that @xmath12 vanisches , and stars denote points where @xmath33 is uncertain .",
    "the lines sketch the limits of the aoki phase .",
    "the data indicate that the point ( @xmath34)=(@xmath35 ) ( circle ) is very close to the lower critical line @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have also performed simulations for the finite - temperature case . in contrast to zero temperature",
    "we find the aoki phase at @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapolation46fint ] .",
    "one can see that the polyakov loop ( open symbols ) steeply rises near @xmath36 where @xmath9 ( filled symbols ) extrapolates to a finite value .",
    "this means that the finite - temperature phase transition occurs close to the aoki phase .",
    "we were not able to detect a separation of this transition from the aoki phase .",
    "this is in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite where a scenario with separated transition lines is proposed .",
    "all simulations were done on the cray t3e at konrad - zuse - zentrum fr informationstechnik berlin .",
