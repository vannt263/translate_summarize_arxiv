    "it is known  @xcite that for distances @xmath24  0.3  fm the fundamental potential is well described by the parametrisation , @xmath25 perturbation theory tells us , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . while the fundamental potential in pure gauge theories linearly rises _ ad infinitum",
    "_ , the adjoint potential will be screened by gluons and , at sufficiently large distance , decay into two gluelumps ( or gluinoballs ) , bound states of a static adjoint source ( gluino ) and gluons .",
    "this string breaking has indeed been confirmed  @xcite .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the adjoint string tension is _",
    "zero_. in fact , all charges in higher than the fundamental representation will be at least partially screened by the background gluons .",
    "for instance , @xmath28 : in interacting with the glue , the sextet potential obtains a fundamental component .",
    "however , in an intermediate range an approximate linear behaviour is found  @xcite , such that one might speculate whether in this region the casimir scaling hypothesis @xmath29 holds .    a simple rule , related to the centre of the group , is reflected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reps ] ) : where ever @xmath30 , the source will be reduced into a singlet component at large distance while , where ever @xmath31 , it will be screened up to a residual ( anti-)triplet component , i.e.one can easily read off the asymptotic string tension ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) from the third column of the table , rather than having to multiply and reduce representations .",
    "if centre symmetry plays such a prominent rle at infinite distance , one might imagine the intermediate distance slopes to count the number of fundamental flux tubes @xmath34 that are embedded into the higher representation vortex .",
    "this flux counting model is supported by indications that the qcd vacuum lies on the boundary between a type i and a type ii superconductor  @xcite and , therefore , interactions between neighbouring vortices are weak . indeed , latest results on the adjoint su(2 ) potential  @xcite as well as on the octet and sextet su(3 ) potentials  @xcite turn out to lie significantly lower than the expected casimir ratios suggest .",
    "expectations from both models , casimir scaling and flux counting , at least for the lower dimensional representations , are close to each other , such that discriminating between them represents a numerical challenge .",

    "additional simulations are being performed at courser lattices with constant renormalised anisotropy .",

    "( [ eq : param ] ) .",
    "the expectations on the potentials @xmath47 , which are dispayed in the figure , correspond to this fit curve , multiplied by the factors @xmath48 .",
    "as one can see , up to distances where the signal disappears into noise or the string might break , the data is well described by the casimir scaling assumption .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we have subtracted the fundamental potential , multiplied by the factors @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the adjoint and sextet potentials , respectively .",
    "we benefit from a reduction of statistical errors , due to correlations between the data sets .",
    "while the flux counting model is certainly ruled out , the casimir scaling model tends to slightly overestimate the data points . for higher representations ,",
    "the situation looks similar . compared to results from coarser lattices  @xcite ( @xmath51 as opposed to @xmath52 ) the disagreement , however , is vastly reduced and will eventually completely disappear in the continuum limit .",
