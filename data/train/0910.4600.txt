    "strong gravitational lenses provide an opportunity for studying properties of distant galaxies . because surface brightness is unchanged during lensing , magnification of the image provides amplification of the image flux and allows studies of details that would otherwise be too faint for detailed ground - based investigation .",
    "models of the lens systems also provide information on the mass distribution , including dark matter , of the lenses themselves .",
    "recent wide area optical surveys have enabled identification of new samples of strong lens systems . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  @xcite",
    "spectroscopic data has been used  @xcite to identify @xmath6 strong lensing candidates in systems where multiple spectra appear in a single @xmath2-wide spectral fiber .",
    "the sdss imaging data provides the opportunity to identify a complementary set of strong lens systems that have a larger lens - arc separation @xmath7 .",
    "an imaging search of 240 rich clusters  @xcite yielded 16 strong lens systems with large ( @xmath8 ) radius , where the lensing interpretation is based on morphology , and 21 additional systems for which the lensing interpretation is less certain .",
    "several more large arcs in the sdss data have been described in recent papers  @xcite .",
    "the cfhtls field and cosmos field have yielded 40  @xcite and 70  @xcite strong lens candidate systems .",
    "relatively few arc systems have been reported where the lensed galaxy is known to have redshift @xmath9 .",
    "some systems with high surface brightness have been reported .",
    "the brightest lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) currently known is sdss j002240.91 + 143110.4 `` the 8 oclock arc ''  @xcite with a redshift @xmath10 and magnitude @xmath11 .",
    "other bright systems include sdss j120602.09 + 514229.5 `` the clone ''  @xcite with redshift @xmath12 and magnitude @xmath13 , ms 1512-cb58  @xcite with redshift @xmath10 and magnitude @xmath14 , and the system  @xcite lensed by macs j2135.2 - 0102 with redshift @xmath15 .",
    "motivated by our discovery of `` the 8 oclock arc '' , we initiated a program , the sloan bright arcs survey , to identify and confirm lensed high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we recently reported  @xcite the discovery of six spectroscopically confirmed systems with redshifts @xmath16 to @xmath17 . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery and confirmation of four more systems with redshift @xmath18 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath19",
    "we describe the strong - lens arc search samples and candidate identification procedure . in @xmath20",
    "we describe our follow - up imaging and spectroscopy procedure . in @xmath21",
    "we describe the results from the follow - up and use those results to calculate properties of the lensed galaxies .",
    "finally , in @xmath22 , we describe further follow - up measurements underway and summarize .",
    "between 2000 and 2008 , the sloan digital sky survey imaged more than 8,400 square degrees of the extragalactic sky in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27-band filters and obtained spectra of 930,000 galaxies .",
    "we searched  @xcite for strong - gravitational lens galaxies in the sdss data release 5 catalog  @xcite around luminous red galaxies ( lrg s ) @xcite and brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg s )  @xcite .",
    "these were sorted according to the number , @xmath28 , of additional galaxies located within @xmath29 that have a color @xmath24-@xmath25 @xmath30 and @xmath25-@xmath26 @xmath30 .",
    "the list of candidates was provided to a web - based display tool that allows one to extract small false - color images using the sdss catalog archive server ( cas ) , based on a user - defined list of positions .",
    "we inspected the images to find ones where there was a spatially continuous arc or ring , or a nearly spatially continuous set of knots , ( the source candidate ) that is centered or nearly centered on a galaxy or galaxy cluster ( the lens candidate ) .",
    "we required that the source candidate not have a distinct color - change over its length ( to be consistent with a single lensed source interpretation ) and that the source candidate not be continuously - connected to the central object by spiral arms , bars , or non - structural lumination .",
    "this was to eliminate galaxies that are providing both the central structure and the arc , ring , or knot .",
    "independent inspections were performed by four different people and any candidate that was noted by two or more scanners was marked for further study .",
    "there were 14 such candidates .",
    "in addition , a second list of candidates resulted from an independent inspection of an sdss dr6 catalog of merging galaxies . in this catalog , a merging galaxy pair",
    "is defined  @xcite as two galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath31 separated by less than the sum of their respective petrosian radii  @xcite .",
    "there are many systems with morphology and color similar to our other strong lens candidates .",
    "we followed up the 14 candidates from the first list and a subset of the candidates from the second list using the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5 m telescope at the apache point observatory .",
    "visible - wavelength imaging was performed using the spicam ccd imager , which has a field - of - view of 4.78 arcminutes square and a plate scale of @xmath32 per pixel .",
    "we observed each candidate system in the three sdss filters @xmath33 , taking in each filter typically three 300-second exposures , dithered with @xmath34 offsets .",
    "the images were bias subtracted and flatfielded using standard iraf tasks and were then coadded using the swarp package  ( bertin 2006 ) .",
    "astrometric calibration was carried out using matches to objects in the sdss .",
    "likewise , photometric calibration was done by matching to stars in the sdss . specifically , we used galfit  @xcite to fit moffat profiles to stars in the images , and set the photometric zeropoint of an image by taking the median offset between the moffat profile total magnitudes and the sdss model magnitudes for these stars .",
    "additional details of our reduction procedure may be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "we report magnitudes in @xmath2-diameter circular apertures for our arc systems ( except one instance as noted ) , where the photometry was done using sextractor  @xcite in dual - image mode , using the @xmath25-band image for each system to define object detection . note that due to imperfect sextractor deblending of the contaminating light of the lensing galaxies from that of the arcs , the magnitudes we quote for the arc components may be systematically too bright by a few tenths of a magnitude , especially in the @xmath26 and @xmath25 images where the red lensing galaxies are more prominent .",
    "we will defer to future analyses more careful photometric modeling of these systems ( i.e. , using galfit to subtract the lensing galaxy light , as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a prelude to detailed lens modeling , but in the present discovery paper simple aperture magnitudes will suffice as reasonable first approximations to the photometry of the arc components .",
    "we also report sextractor isophotal magnitudes for our arcs , where the limiting isophotes are the sextractor @xmath25-band detection thresholds ( 1.5 times the image rms ) . unless specifically noted , all magnitudes reported are those from @xmath2-diameter apertures .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained using the dual - imaging spectograph ( dis iii ) , a medium - dispersion spectrograph with separate red / blue grating setups .",
    "the spectral range is 3000  @xmath35   with a resolution of @xmath36   per pixel in the blue and @xmath37   per pixel in the red .",
    "bright arcs and central galaxies were targeted , typically with three 900 second exposures using a @xmath38 or @xmath39 wide slit . the spectra were reduced and extracted using standard iraf routines and were flux calibrated using observations of the spectrophotometric standard g191-b2b .",
    "redshift measurements were done using the iraf external task xcsao , by cross correlation against the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) template of shapley et al .",
    "the cross correlation was limited to the observed wavelength range 3500  5500    ( except for one system , as noted below ) , where all the relevant lbg spectroscopic features were located for our systems .",
    "note we calibrated all our spectra to air wavelengths , so that the lbg template had to be transformed from vacuum to air wavelengths before being used for cross correlation .",
    "dates for useful follow - up observations are listed in tables  [ tab - obs ] and [ tab - spe ] .",
    "we report results on four systems that were found to have source redshifts @xmath0 . figures  [ fig-1 ] and [ fig-2 ] show color - coadd images of the four systems as observed from the arc 3.5 m telescope using spicam .",
