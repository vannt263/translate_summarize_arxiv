    "[ rem : methods ] to prove conjecture [ conj : kleppe - ellia ] for a given @xmath548 , it suffices to prove that @xmath4 is a component of @xmath17 because @xmath9 is automatically non - reduced along @xmath4 by the assumption @xmath554 . in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , the authors proved that @xmath4 is a component of @xmath17 by contradiction .",
    "first they assumed that a general member @xmath3 of @xmath4 is a specialization of curves contained not in a cubic but in a surface of degree greater than three .",
    "then they got a contradiction by using a dimension count of a certain family of curves on a quartic ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or using the fact that the dimension of cohomology groups can only increase under specialization by semicontinuity ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally we remark that @xmath4 in conjecture [ conj : kleppe - ellia ] is not an irreducible component of @xmath17 provided that @xmath567 .",

    "we can naturally consider the same problem as problem [ prob : classn problem ] for curves contained in a smooth quadric surface @xmath569 with bidegree @xmath570 . this problem is easier than problem [ prob : classn problem ] .",
    "one of the reason for this is that we have @xmath571 for any effective divisor @xmath61 on @xmath572 .",
    "let @xmath573 and @xmath574 be two integers . for a pair @xmath575 of non - negative integers satisfying @xmath576 , @xmath577 and @xmath578 , we define an irreducible closed subset @xmath579 of @xmath9 as follows : @xmath580 then @xmath579 is an irreducible closed subset of @xmath9 whose general member is contained in a smooth quadric surface and maximal among all such subsets .",

    "then @xmath9 is generically non - singular along @xmath579 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath585 , then @xmath579 is an irreducible component of @xmath9 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath579 is a subvariety of @xmath9 of codimension @xmath586 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a general member of @xmath579 which is contained in a smooth quadric surface @xmath572 , and let @xmath67 be the class of hyperplane sections of @xmath572",
