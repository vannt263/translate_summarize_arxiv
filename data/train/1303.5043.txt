    "quantum entanglement , and its inherent non local properties , are among the most fascinating and challenging features of the quantum world .",
    "in addition , entanglement plays a central role in quantum information @xcite . since its first description in the decade of 1930 ( @xcite ) , and in spite of the decisive contribution of j. bell@xcite and the subsequent experimental studies@xcite , entanglement stays even now as a rather mysterious and puzzling property of bipartite quantum objects .",
    "in particular distinguishing between effects related to genuine entanglement and those related to the quantum correlations measured on a single quantum observable is a difficult task@xcite , as can be seen for example by the great number of papers about quantum discord @xcite .",
    "some time ago , a paper was published @xcite which discusses how entangled states would be able to induce transitions in quantum systems that factorized states could not excite .",
    "the physical problem studied in that paper is therefore a good test bench to examine in detail in a simple situation the role of entanglement and of correlations not related to entanglement .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the problem under consideration is the probability of two - photon two - atom ( 2p2a ) excitation , in the situation where the two atoms are of different species and have different transition frequencies and the light to which the atoms are submitted is in general non - resonant for each one , but resonant for the system of two atoms .",
    "two photon absorption by single atoms or molecules have been studied since 1931 @xcite and remains a current subject of theoretical and experimental research @xcite . when the atoms have more than one intermediate state many important features , including cross section cancellation and enhancement , are observed @xcite .",
    "these features have recently been shown to be applicable in characterizing the quantum states of the absorbed two photon @xcite .",
    "it has also been known for a long time , that the two photons resonant excitation of two different atoms is indeed possible when the two atoms are interacting @xcite .",
    "a nearly monochromatic light beam will have a resonant two photon absorption peak when tuned across the average frequency of the two atoms .",
    "different experiments have since then confirmed this theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "in addition to a direct potential interaction between the atoms , like the dipole - dipole , cooperative 2p2a has also been predicted for pairs of atoms inside an optical cavity @xcite . in this case the physical interaction is mediated by the radiation background surrounding the atoms .",
    "ref @xcite addresses the case of two photon absorption in absence of interaction between the two atoms , with the excitation made using some particular entangled state of light .",
    "the conclusion of the authors of @xcite is that _ in some situations entanglement can replace a real physical interaction _ , which is a far reaching statement and an important physical property related to entanglement .",
    "surprisingly , this question did not attract much attention during several years .",
    "the same subject was also considered , but in the context of spin entanglement in electron paramagnetic resonance by k. salikhov@xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite the related problem of interaction with pairs of broadband spectrum photons has been discussed .    in this paper , we will determine the probability of 2p2a excitation by different multi - modal states of light .",
    "from these results we draw conclusions on the respective role of entanglement and of correlations not related to entanglement in such a process .",
    "section ii gives the general framework in which the problem is treated .",
    "section iii derives from a second order perturbation theory the relevant transition probability .",
    "results for various different two photon states , introduced in section iv , are given in section v and vi .",
    "finally , in section vii we discuss different hypotheses for the physical origin of the enhancement of the 2p2a process .",
    "let us first precise the model we are using and the notations .",
    "we consider two different two - level atoms labeled ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , having ground and excited states @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , corresponding bohr frequencies @xmath3 and spontaneous emission rates @xmath4 , interacting with a quantized field .",
    "we assume that that the transitions occur in times must shorter than the two atom lifetimes so that we can consider that the two excited states have infinite lifetimes ( @xmath5 ) and keep for ever their excitation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we will assume that the light source is far from the atoms , so that the only non - empty modes are plane - wave modes having a single propagation direction @xmath6 and a single polarization .",
    "in this situation one can use annihilation operators depending only on the frequency @xmath7 . at the rotating wave approximation the hamiltonian of the system",
    "is then given by : @xmath8=\\delta_{\\ell,\\ell ' } & & \\notag \\\\",
    "v&=\\hbar b_1^{\\dag } \\sum_{\\ell } f_{1}(\\omega_{\\ell})a_{\\ell}+   \\hbar   b_2^{\\dag } \\sum_{\\ell } f_{2}(\\omega_{\\ell})a_{\\ell}+h.c . ,",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 being a slowly varying function of the photon frequency , can be treated as a constant @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the electric dipole matrix element of atom @xmath13 , @xmath14 the transverse section of the beam which is focused on the atoms , @xmath15 the position of atom @xmath13 and @xmath16 the length of the quantization box , the mode density in terms of frequencies @xmath17 being @xmath18 . for simplicity , we will set @xmath19 and hence will not consider propagation effects .",
    "the evolution of whole system is described by a unitary operator @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the input light state , which can be either a pure two - photon state @xmath23 or a mixed state in its spectral decomposition form @xmath24 .",
    "the probability of 2p2a excitation is given by : @xmath25 so that the transition probability is known when the field variable operator @xmath26 is determined and the incident light state @xmath22 is known .",
    "the exact expression of the evolution operator is unfortunately not easy to obtain . to simplify our discussion",
    ", we will use lowest order perturbation theory , which is a good approximation for bi - photon states which do not carry much energy .",
    "if we assume that the coupling between the light field and the two atoms is weak , the leading term in the evolution is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the coupling term in the interaction picture .",
    "one has    @xmath29    so that the leading term of the co - excitation probability ( [ p ] ) reads @xmath30 in the case of a continuous frequency distribution of photons , one must replace the sum by an integral : @xmath31 where @xmath32 in the annihilation operator of a monochromatic photon of frequency @xmath33 .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath34 is the product of two factors which represent the response of each atom to the field .",
    "when time @xmath35 goes to infinity these two factors behave roughly like dirac delta functions centered on individual atom resonances ( we will precise this argument in section vi ) .",
    "the 2p2a excitation probability is indeed induced by the wings of the incident light spectrum which are resonant with the atoms .",
    "consequently , if one photon is absorbed by one atom , there is no reason why the second photon should be absorbed by the second atom in a way correlated to the absorption of the first photon . in other words ,",
    "the 2p2a excitation phenomenon has no reason a priori to have a resonant behavior when the 2p2a resonance condition @xmath36 is fulfilled .    however , as the process is non - linear and involves two atoms , it can be enhanced by taking advantage of correlation effects between the atoms or between the photons :    * a first possibility consists in introducing an interaction between the two atoms .",
    "let @xmath37 be the maximal bohr frequency of the two - atom system : if one photon with frequency @xmath38 is absorbed , then the two atoms will be more likely to absorb another photon with frequency @xmath39 in a resonant two - photon process @xcite .",
    "this was experimentally demonstrated in @xcite using nearly degenerate photon pairs . * a second possibility is to use correlated photons to interact with the two atoms .",
    "let us consider a source that emits correlated photons : if a photon is absorbed by one atom , then the remaining atom will interact with its correlated photon with a higher probability , leading to enhanced 2p2a resonance ( we will precise this argument and the kind of correlation needed in section vii ) .",
    "we will now precise these latter ideas by having a closer look at different possible light states likely to induce such a 2p2a transition .",
    "before we go further , let us precise the different kinds of two - photon states that we will consider in the following . starting from entangled pure quantum state @xmath40 , having a density matrix @xmath41 of matrix elements",
    "@xmath42 , one can construct others that have the same mean energy and the same single photon spectrum , and hence that would give the same transition probabilities for a single photon resonance .",
    "we choose two special cases that will allow a quantitative evaluation of the role of correlations :    * the first one is defined as @xmath43 \\pi_k\\otimes\\pi_q= \\sum_{k , q } \\rho_{kkqq}|1_k , 1_q\\rangle \\langle 1_k , 1_q|\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the frequency projection operator @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the diagonal part of @xmath22 .",
    "it has lost any temporal field coherence and is time independent .",
    "it is actually a _ _ correlated - separable state__@xcite , which results from the `` disentanglement '' of the previous one .",
    "it gives rise however to correlations between its two parties .",
    "* the second one is defined as @xmath47 \\pi_k \\otimes \\sum_q \\text{tr}[\\pi_q\\rho_0 ] \\pi_q= \\sum_{k , q } \\sum_{q'}\\rho_{kkq'q'}|1_k \\rangle",
    "\\langle 1_k |   \\otimes \\sum_{k'}\\rho_{k'k'qq}| 1_q\\rangle \\langle1_q |\\ ] ] this is a fully factorized state , which does not give rise to any correlation whatsoever .",
    "these states will induce 2p2a excitation with respective probabilities @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the two diagonal density matrices @xmath50 describe two c.w .",
    "fields whilst the entangled pure state @xmath22 describes a pulse , as a result , at a time @xmath35 , the flow of energy having interacted with atoms in each state is different . however , as shown in appendix b , this quantity is quite the same in each state when @xmath51 . for comparison",
    ", we will take @xmath51 through the whole paper .",
    "we are of course interested in cases where one observes an increase in the excitation probability , i.e. when @xmath52 ; if @xmath53 , then entanglement is indeed the key to efficient 2p2a transition , whereas if @xmath54 , correlations , of quantum or classical origin , are more important than entanglement in the present problem .",
    "we will now examine the efficiency of various multimode light states for the simultaneous excitation of the two atoms .",
    "let us begin by the simplest case : two uncorrelated photon wavepackets of mean frequencies @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and respective spectral widths @xmath57 and @xmath58 much bigger than the detecting atom spectral widths @xmath59 and @xmath60 , emitted by two uncorrelated atoms excited at the same time in the past and arriving at the detecting atoms position at @xmath61 , described therefore by the bi - photon state @xmath62 with @xmath63 it is the tensor product of two single - photon wave packets@xcite of duration @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the calculation of the probability amplitude in ( [ proba ] )",
    ", we will replace the sum over modes by the double integral @xmath66 , extend each integration domain to the whole real axis and use the residue theorem @xcite . for the transition probability amplitude ,",
    "one finds , when @xmath67 and @xmath68 while keeping @xmath69 and @xmath70 : @xmath71 if we assume that the coefficients @xmath72 do not vary with frequency the normalization of the two - photon state imposes that : @xmath73 so that the transition probability @xmath74 is    @xmath75[(\\omega_2-\\omega_{\\beta})^2+\\gamma_{\\beta}^2]}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 .",
    "let us first assume that we are in the best possible situation , where the photons are separately resonant with the two atoms : @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the transition probability is then equal to @xmath79 which can be written in a more general way @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the effective area of frequency distribution @xmath82 in the @xmath83 plane ( see figures ( [ frequencycor ] ) ) .",
    "this result turns out to be general and implies that all pure states having the same effective areas @xmath81 , entangled or not , will produce the same doubly resonant transition probability .",
    "thus we regard ( [ res ] ) as a universal result under the double resonance condition , and its value will serve as a reference for all subsequent transition probabilities .    in an actual experimental situation",
    ", one may take : @xmath84khz , @xmath85mhz , @xmath86 , thus @xmath87 .",
    "let us now turn to the 2p2a resonant case , where none of the two photons are resonant with the two atoms , but where the sum of their two energies almost matches the sum of the two atomic energies : @xmath88 .",
    "the transition probability ( [ 11 ] ) has in this case no resonant variation as a function of the 2p2a detuning @xmath89 .",
    "when @xmath90 the transition probability is : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the smallest frequency mismatch between the emitting atoms frequencies and the detecting atoms frequencies , supposed to be much larger than the atomic widths . without loss of generality ,",
    "we have taken @xmath93 .",
    "we then conclude that the special case of 2p2a excitation probability by uncorrelated photons is also non zero for any couple of frequencies @xmath94 , thus such a two - photon transition turns out not to be disallowed but simply induced by the wings of the two single photon frequency resonances .",
    "it is therefore very weak , as witnessed by the @xmath95 variation of probability .",
    "let us now envision the case considered in @xcite of a two - photon light state produced by a three - level atom excited at a given time @xmath61 in the upper state that cascades down to the ground state on two successive transitions of bohr frequencies successively equal to @xmath55 and @xmath96 .",
    "the corresponding spontaneous emission rates are @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that the emitted light is wholly directed in the @xmath6 direction of atoms ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ( by means of a parabolic mirror for example ) .",
    "it is described by a bi - photon wave - packet with a coefficient @xmath97 equal , at a time @xmath35 long compared to the lifetimes of the two transitions , to@xcite : @xmath98[\\omega_q-\\omega_{\\beta}+i\\gamma_{\\beta}]}\\ ] ] here this entangled non stationary state is produced by a cascade , so that the photon of frequency @xmath99 always arrives just after the photon of frequency @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , the probability to have photons of frequency sum @xmath100 close to @xmath101 is high .",
    "we have therefore an entangled state which is not only correlated in time but also anti - correlated in frequency .",
    "it is the time - energy analog of the position - momentum entangled state introduced by epr , or of the field quadrature entangled state@xcite .    using the residue theorem",
    ", the transition probability amplitude reads exactly @xmath102+(1\\leftrightarrow2)\\ ] ] when @xmath103 , the four decaying terms in eq.([generalsol ] ) are negligible , leading to a compact expression @xmath104\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the frequency difference between frequency @xmath106 and frequency @xmath107 .",
    "let us first consider here also the most favorable case , which is the double resonance ( dr ) situation . keeping only the largest term , one obtains in this case for the probability amplitude when @xmath67 and @xmath68 : @xmath108 using the same assumption as in the previous calculation",
    ", one finds for the probability @xmath109 it is time independent because we are considering times much longer than the two - photon pulse of duration @xmath110 . as it is equal to the probability obtained with uncorrelated photons ,",
    "we conclude that entanglement does not help in the fully resonant case , but does not harm either .",
    "let us now turn to the 2p2a resonance case .",
    "one obtains in this case for the probability : @xmath111 ^ 2\\ ] ]    this expression , already obtained in @xcite , shows that for this state the probability has indeed a resonant character around the two - atom two - photon resonance @xmath112 .",
    "the transition probability @xmath113 at the exact two - atom two - photon resonance is then : @xmath114    one therefore finds that the transition probability is in the present case smaller than @xmath115 by a factor @xmath116 at exact 2p2a resonance , as expected because one is now less resonant than in the double resonance case .",
    "one finds more importantly that @xmath117 _ is larger than @xmath118 , i.e. than in the two uncorrelated photon case , by a factor @xmath119 _ , which can be very large .",
    "this enhancement of the 2p2a transition probability is the main result of @xcite : entanglement may indeed significantly enhance the two - photon two - atom process . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no experiment has been undertaken to show such a striking effect .",
    "it must be emphasized that the present considerations do not imply that the atom cascade entangled state is the only one likely to produce such a significant increase in the transition probability .",
    "this is the reason why we will now consider other light quantum states which may also be of interest in the present problem .",
    "let us now consider the two states that have the same energy and the same spectrum that we have introduced in section ( iv ) , namely the correlated - separable state : @xmath120}|1_k,1_q\\rangle\\langle1_k,1_q|\\ ] ] and the factorized state : @xmath121 the first one corresponds to an atomic cascade for which the starting time is random , thereby averaging to zero all the off - diagonal time dependent terms in the density matrix , the second one characterizes a mixed state with two uncorrelated photons having the same spectrum than the initial cascade state .",
    "they give rise to the following transition probabilities :    @xmath122    at exact 2p2a resonance , we have @xmath123 and @xmath124 . at any time @xmath35 , one finds @xmath125 , since the spectral widths are much smaller than the 2p2a detuning .",
    "this fact shows that correlations play indeed an important role in the efficiency of the excitation .",
    "note that @xmath126 and @xmath127 depend on time , as can be expected in a situation where the detecting atoms , which have an infinite lifetime , are submitted to a stationary quantum state , and therefore to c.w .",
    "light . in order to compare @xmath126 and @xmath127 to @xmath113 ( equation ( [ pca ] ) ) , which is induced by a pulse of light",
    ", we need to fix an interaction time @xmath35 .",
    "it is shown in appendix b that the two atoms are submitted to the same energy flow at time @xmath51 .",
    "one then obtains at this time and at exact resonance :    @xmath128    we thus find the result that _ a correlated - separable state like @xmath46 can induce the 2p2a transition as efficiently as the entangled cascade state_. this statement constitutes the main result of the present paper .",
    "let us stress that @xmath46 , though not entangled , has indeed genuine quantum properties , being a mixture of single photon states which are highly non - classical .",
    "it displays strong correlations that we will study in more detail in section vi .",
    "let us now examine the two - photon state @xmath129 produced by non - degenerate parametric down conversion which has been under wide and in - depth investigation for many years .",
    "because of its @xmath130 nonlinearity , a non - linear crystal submitted to a pulsed pump field of central frequency @xmath131 and narrow bandwidth @xmath132 emits a signal field ( central frequency @xmath55 ) and an idler field ( central frequency @xmath96 ) .",
    "let @xmath133 be the frequency width of the phase matching curve .",
    "for the sake of computational simplicity we will use a gaussian approximation for both the laser lineshape and the phase matching curve .",
    "the crystal generates in such a case an entangled state which is described by a wavepacket with a coefficient @xmath134 @xcite given by @xmath135 where @xmath136 is normalized coefficient , satisfying @xmath137 in the expression of ( [ spdc ] ) , we have assumed that the pump laser pulse had a gaussian temporal shape centered at time @xmath138 to provide most of the photons a chance to interact with the two detecting atoms .",
    "the factor @xmath13 in the second component originates from a relative phase ( depends on the birefringence ) which is set to be @xmath139 for the sake of simplicity in our case .    here",
    "we will also extend the double integral to the whole plane and find , when @xmath35 is sufficient large@xcite , the transition probability @xmath140    let us also take into account the two mixed biphoton states ( @xmath141 ) pertaining to the pure spdc type ii biphoton state ( [ spdc ] ) , @xmath142\\!\\!\\otimes\\!\\!\\left[\\sum_q\\!\\ !",

    "the first one corresponds to a spdc process in which all the off - diagonal time dependent terms in the density matrix are averaging to zero by random processes , while the second one characterizes a mixed state with two uncorrelated photons having the same spectrum than the initial spdc state .",
    "when @xmath35 is sufficient large , their corresponding transition probabilities read@xmath144 we will once again take @xmath51 to be able to compare in a fair way the pulsed and c.w .",
    "excitations through the whole following discussions .",
    "let us first consider the dr situation with @xmath145 and @xmath146 . keeping the largest term , one finds the probability @xmath147 once again ,",
    "we conclude that entanglement is not active in enhancing the transition probability in the double resonance case .",
    "one also finds @xmath148 when @xmath149 . in the following",
    "we will take this correspondences of spectral widths for comparisons .",
    "henceforth , @xmath150 or @xmath151 will be regarded as a reference in the discussions related to spdc biphoton state .",
    "now we will turn to the 2p2a case .",
    "the transition probability @xmath152 has indeed a resonant character around @xmath112 . at the exact 2p2a resonance ,",
    "it is equal to @xmath153 which is much smaller than for the atom cascade state because the factor @xmath154 enters now as exponent in a gaussian function and the detuning @xmath92 is much greater than the spectral widths .",
    "for the factorized , uncorrelated state @xmath155 , the transition probability in this case reads @xmath156 thus , @xmath157 is much greater than the probability given by the factorized state because of the scale factor @xmath158 .",
    "so we obtain in the parametric down conversion configuration the same conclusion as the one drawn in @xcite for the atomic cascade : the entangled state @xmath129 is much more efficient for inducing a 2p2a resonance than the factorized , uncorrelated state .    for the correlated - separable state @xmath159 , the transition probability reads @xmath160 thus , one has @xmath161 .",
    "the same conclusion is found as in the cascade case : the correlated - separable state is as efficient as the entangled state to boost the 2p2a resonance .",
    "the fact that @xmath162 is much larger than @xmath163 and @xmath164 once again shows that correlations , which are not necessarily related to entanglement , play indeed a crucial role in the efficiency of the excitation .",
    "we have so far studied interesting but specific states of light and showed an enhancement effect for some of them , entangled or correlated - separable .",
    "it would be interesting to consider now more general classes of light states .",
    "let us go back to the initial equations ( [ ampl ] ) and ( [ proba ] ) .",
    "they contain functions like @xmath165/\\omega_{1m}$ ] .",
    "as explained in the appendix a , even though this function does not act as a dirac function when it is applied to integrations with any function , it indeed tends to @xmath166 when @xmath167 when applied to functions of @xmath168 that have a fourier transform which is strictly zero for @xmath169 .",
    "such will be the case here .",
    "the initial two - photon light state @xmath170 is the pure state : @xmath171 let us assume that this state describes a `` switched - on '' light which is not vacuum only after time @xmath61 .",
    "one can then use the delta function approximation .",
    "the probability that the two atoms are found in the excited state at times long compared to the pulse duration is now @xmath172 mathematically , if @xmath173 this interference , which has been studied in the literature @xcite , may lead to strong variations according to the relative phase .",
    "according to the cauchy - schwatz inequality , one has @xmath174 however , physically speaking , only one component between @xmath175 and @xmath176 dominates in the expression ( [ generalp ] ) .",
    "this is because we have assumed that the quantities @xmath177 are sufficiently separated from each other but with a small 2p2a detuning @xmath178 , as a result , @xmath179 should be closer to one of the central frequencies of the fields than to the rest one . under this condition , one has @xmath180 the correlated and factorized states @xmath181 analogous to the initial state @xmath182 , give rise to the following 2p2a transition probabilities : @xmath183    a discriminability index in the role of enhancing 2p2a transition probability is defined by the quotient @xmath184 between @xmath185 and @xmath126 at @xmath51 , @xmath186 thus , one finds @xmath187 .",
    "the maximum value 2 is achieved when @xmath188 .",
    "one has @xmath189 under the physical conditions we stated before .",
    "that is , the entangled and the correlated - separable state yield almost equal transition probabilities .",
    "this implies that the conclusion that we had drawn in the special previous cases is valid for a large class of two - photon states : correlated states are as efficient as entangled states in 2p2a co - excitation when they have delivered the same amount of energy to the two atoms .",
    "another important discriminability index is the ratio between the two transition rates @xmath126 and @xmath127 : @xmath190 the value of the enhancement factor @xmath191 can be used as a witness for the correlation needed in such a problem .",
    "note in addition that , while @xmath185 is sensitive to possible destructive interference effects between @xmath175 and @xmath176 , @xmath126 is not .",
    "therefore , the enhancement effect as indicated by g , and due to correlations not related to entanglement , turns out to be more `` robust '' than the one related to it .",
    "so far we have only considered biphoton states of different shapes , which are all strongly non - classical objects , as they are produced by spontaneous emission or parametric fluorescence which are specifically quantum processes with no classical equivalent .",
    "but one can also envision superpositions of two - mode coherent states of the form :    @xmath192    where @xmath193 is the coherent state @xmath194 in the mode of frequency @xmath38 , @xmath195 being the same complex number for all modes .",
    "the calculation of the transition probability must be redone from the beginning . by using the approximation @xmath196",
    "valid for @xmath197 , one finally finds : @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the probability ( [ proba ] ) obtained for two - photon states .",
    "apart from the energy scaling factor @xmath200 , the conclusions of the previous paragraphs hold in the present case , which looks much more classical than the previously studied ones , as such states can be produced by classical means .",
    "we have found in the previous sections that the 2p2a transition probability depends crucially on the specific state of light used for the excitation , even when all the considered states have the same energy spectrum .",
    "the question we address now is the physical origin of an enhanced transition probability .",
    "we have seen that entangled and not entangled states may give comparable results , so a first answer to the question is obviously that entanglement is not at the origin of the effect , but rather some kind of correlation effect which is shared by entangled and not entangled states .",
    "candidates likely to play a role in the present problem is time correlation and frequency correlation .",
    "we will now examine them successively      it is well characterized by the cross second order correlation function @xmath201 @xmath202}{\\text{tr}[\\rho_0\\hat{e}_{\\alpha}^{(-)}(t)\\hat{e}^{(+)}_{\\alpha,}(t)]\\text{tr}[\\rho_0\\hat{e}_{\\beta}^{(-)}(t)\\hat{e}^{(+)}_{\\beta}(t)]}\\ ] ] assuming that the amplitude of the single - photon electric field is a smooth function of @xmath38 , one gets for the pure state @xmath203 , @xmath204 it is the two - time fourier transform of the two - photon state .    1 .   in the case of the cascade state ( [ entangled ] )",

    "time averaged state in which the photons arrive at any time .",
    "it is also the case for the coherent states ( [ coherent ] ) . as these states give 2p2a transition probabilities comparable to the entangled state",
    ", we must conclude that the temporal correlation is not the physical origin of the enhancement effect , nor the time ordering of the photons present in the cascade state .",

    "the type ii spdc biphoton source is non - degenerate and each photon has two distribution peaks , thus one sees two bright spots in the left side bottom plot and 4 bright spots in the factorized case in the right side bottom plot . in a real condition , the distances of the peaks in the bottom side plots are much greater , and the sizes of spots are much smaller . ]",
    "this quantity is plotted in figure ( [ frequencycor ] ) for the cascade and spdc states , either entangled , correlated - separable or factorized .",
    "one observes that the frequency correlation functions take significant values only on the anti - diagonal for the left side plots , which implies that the corresponding states exhibit strong frequency anticorrelations .",
    "this is not the case for the right side plots .",
    "the width of the anti - diagonal , which gives the characteristic width of the frequency anticorrelation , is equal to @xmath226 in both the cascade and spdc entangled and correlated - separable cases .",
    "let us note that the entangled cascade and spdc states are the only ones in our list exhibiting simultaneously time correlations and frequency anti - correlations : one has in these states epr - like correlations , revealed by a violation of the time - energy heisenberg inequality@xcite when @xmath227 .",
    "the important point to notice is that such a frequency anti - correlation exists for all the states which exhibit 2p2a resonance enhancement , and is not present for the states which do not give rise to this effect .",
    "we are therefore led to the conclusion they _ the property needed to enhance the 2p2a excitation is precisely the presence of strong frequency anticorrelations in the quantum state_.    this conclusion , that we have demonstrated for the two specific examples that we have considered in the first sections of this paper , is far more general , as can be seen on the expression of the probability written for any switched on two - photon state .",
    "equations ( 37 ) , ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) show indeed that the probability of 2p2a excitation is proportional to the component of the density matrix of the two - photon state corresponding to the existence of one photon with frequency @xmath179 and one photon with frequency @xmath228 .",
    "this gives a simple interpretation of the problem : there is 2p2a excitation only when each photon of the two - photon state is resonant with the atomic transition of the atom it excites .",
    "this is expected , since we are considering that the atomic excited states have a very long lifetime , and therefore very narrow linewidths .",
    "since the spectrum of each photon of the source has a much larger bandwidth , the probability of excitation is small . if the photons are not correlated in frequency , the probability of double excitation is proportional to the product of the probabilities that each photon has the corresponding transition frequency , and this yields a very small transition probability .",
    "but when the photons are anti - correlated in frequency such that the sum of their frequencies is equal to the sum of the transition frequencies of the atoms , when one photon is resonant with one atomic transition , the correlated photon will be automatically resonant with the other transition , and the probability of 2p2a transition will in general be much higher than in the non - correlated case .",
    "we can say that the 2p2a transition occurs with a higher probability when the sum of the photon frequencies is found inside a small interval around the sum of the atomic transition frequencies , so that the enhancement is associated with the inverse of the variance of the @xmath82 distribution in the direction of the diagonal .",
    "we have now elements of answer to the question raised in the title and in the introduction about the role of entanglement in the two - photon excitation process considered in this paper : we have shown that what is necessary for the enhancement of the transition probability is not precisely quantum entanglement nor temporal correlations , but frequency anticorrelation , which can be due to the presence of entanglement in the state , but also to correlations that are not related to entanglement .",
    "as any nonlinear process , like two - photon absorption in a single atom @xcite , 2p2a transition probability can be modified by changing the quantum state of light , and therefore the enhancement effect that we have studied in this paper is due to the partial optimization of the quantum state .",
    "we have not treated in this paper the important question of characterizing in a quantitative way the frequency correlation relevant to the present enhancement and relating it to its classical or quantum character though various quantum correlation witnesses such as the quantum discord .",
    "it will be addressed in a subsequent paper , together with the important question of the full optimization of the quantum state with respect to the 2p2a probability maximization , given a constant spectral energy distribution .    * acknowledgements *    the authors thank m. scully , h. eleuch , g.s .",
