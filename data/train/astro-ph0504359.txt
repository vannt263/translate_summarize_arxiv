    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) explosions harbor both spherical supernova ( sn ) ejecta and highly collimated engine - driven jets @xcite .",
    "this `` spherical+jet '' paradigm for the geometry of grbs implies that both explosion components must be studied independently .",
    "early ( @xmath9 few days ) optical observations trace the synchrotron radiation produced from the engine - driven relativistic jets , while late - time ( @xmath10 days ) observations probe the optical emission from the non - relativistic spherical sn ejecta , powered by the decay of @xmath4ni .",
    "such observations allow us to address the following fundamental questions regarding the grb / sn connection : what is the diversity among grb - associated sne , and how does the sample compare to local type ibc supernovae ( sne ibc ) ?",
    "three of the best studied events , sne 1998bw , 2003dh 2003lw ( associated with grbs 980425 , 030329 and 031203 , respectively ) were strikingly similar , with brighter optical luminosities and faster photospheric velocities than local sne ibc @xcite .",
    "these events suggested that the supernovae associated with grbs belong to a distinct sub - class of `` hyper - energetic '' supernovae .",
    "however , there are also several counter - examples : under - luminous sne associated with grbs and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ; events very similar to grbs but differentiated by a soft prompt energy release peaking in the x - ray band ; @xcite ) with optical luminosities significantly fainter than sn1998bw . the most extreme examples are grb010921 ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) and xrf040701 @xcite , for which the associated sne are at least @xmath11 and @xmath12 magnitudes fainter than sn1998bw , respectively .",
    "motivated by our fundamental questions , we began a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) program to study the diversity in supernovae associated with grbs and xrfs ( go-10135 ; pi : kulkarni ) . in @xcite , we presented the results of our _ hst _ supernova search in xrfs 020903 , 040701 , 040812 and 040916 .",
    "we showed that at least some xrfs are associated with sne , but that there may be a significant dispersion in their optical peak magnitudes .    here",
    "we present the results from our _ hst _ study of the supernovae associated with grbs 040924 ( @xmath0 ) and 041006 ( @xmath1 ) . in section ",
    "[ sec : targets ] we show that each is associated with a sn1998bw - like supernova dimmed by @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitudes , respectively , making grb040924 the faintest grb - associated sn detected to date .",
    "these two events suggest a notable dispersion of peak optical magnitudes for grb - associated sne .",
    "finally , we compile optical peak magnitudes and @xmath4ni mass estimates for all grb / xrf - associated sne and local sne ibc to study the diversity among these two samples . in  [ sec : summary ] we address the question of whether both samples are drawn from the same parent population of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "in modeling the grb - associated sne , we adopted optical data for the local sne 1994i @xcite , 1998bw @xcite and 2002ap @xcite as templates .",
    "these three sne were selected based on their well - sampled optical light - curves which represent an overall spread in the observed properties of type ibc supernovae . to produce synthesized light - curves for each of these template sne , we compiled optical @xmath13 observations from the literature and smoothed the extinction - corrected ( foreground plus host galaxy ) light - curves .",
    "we then redshifted the light - curves by interpolating over the photometric spectrum and stretching the arrival time of the photons by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "the details of each template dataset are described in @xcite .",
    "using the _ wide - field camera _ ( _ wfc _ ) of the _ advanced camera for surveys _",
    "( _ acs _ ) on - board _ hst _ , we imaged the fields of grbs 040924 and 041006 . for each target",
    "we undertook observations at several epochs , spanning @xmath15 and @xmath16 days , in order to search for optical emission associated with an underlying supernova .",
    "each epoch consisted of 2 to 4 orbits during which we imaged the field in filters , f775w and/or f850lp , corresponding to sdss @xmath17- and @xmath18- bands , respectively .",
    "the _ hst _ data were processed using the multidrizzle routine @xcite within the stsdas package of iraf .",
    "images were drizzled using pixfrac=0.8 and pixscale=1.0 resulting in a final pixel scale of 0.05 arcsec / pixel .",
    "drizzled images were then registered to the first epoch using the xregister package within iraf .    to search for source variability and remove host galaxy contamination , we used the _ isis _ subtraction routine by @xcite which accounts for temporal variations in the stellar psf .",
    "adopting the final epoch observations as template images , we produced residual images .",
    "these residual images were examined for positive sources positionally coincident with the afterglow error circle . to test our efficiency at recovering faint transient sources , false stars with a range of magnitudes",
    "were inserted into the first epoch images using _ iraf _ task mkobject .",
    "the false stars were overlayed on top of the diffuse host galaxy emission at radial distances similar to that measured for the afterglow .",
    "an examination of the false stellar residuals provided an estimate of the magnitude limit ( @xmath19 ) to which we could reliably recover faint transients .",
    "photometry was performed on the residual sources within a 0.5 arcsec aperture .",
    "we converted the photometric measurements to infinite aperture and calculated the corresponding ab magnitudes within the native _ hst _ filters using the aperture corrections and zero - points provided by @xcite .",
    "for comparison with ground - based data , we also converted the photometric measurements to johnson @xmath20- and @xmath21-band ( vega ) magnitudes using the transformation coefficients derived by @xcite and adopting the source color given by the first epoch f775w and f850lp observations .    in the following sections we summarize the afterglow properties for both targets and the photometry derived from our _ hst _ sn study .",
    "a log of the _ hst _ observations for the grbs follows in table  [ tab : hst ] .",

    "monitoring , the afterglow was @xmath29 mag at @xmath30 minutes and subsequently decayed .",
    "we continued to monitor the afterglow emission from @xmath31 to 1 day after the burst ( table  [ tab : grb040924 ] ) , producing a well - sampled @xmath32-band light - curve .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : grb040924_sn_curve ] , these data show a shallow initial decay , followed by a steepening at @xmath33 days . in an effort to characterize the light - curve behavior , we fit a smoothed , broken power - law model ( e.g. @xcite ) of the form    @xmath34^{-1/s}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the break time in days , @xmath36 is the normalized flux density at @xmath37 , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the asymptotic indices at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath42 is used to parameterize the sharpness of the break . a best fit ( @xmath43 )",
    "is found for the following parameters : @xmath44jy , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 days , and @xmath48 . to interpret this steepening as a jet break",
    "@xcite would imply a electron spectral index , @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "this value is significantly lower than those typically observed ( @xmath51 ; @xcite ) and far below the range predicted by the standard blastwave model , @xmath52 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we therefore ascribe this early afterglow phase ( and steepening ) to another process , perhaps similar to that observed for the initial slow decay of grb021004 @xcite , interpreted as interaction with a stellar wind medium @xcite .",

    "for the first and third epochs , we observed with both the f775w and f850lp filters , while the second epoch consisted of just f775w observations .",
    "we astrometrically tied the _",
    "hst _ and _ p60 _ images using four sources in common resulting in a final systematic uncertainty of 0.22 arcsec ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "our _ hst _ observations reveal that the optical afterglow error circle coincides with a strongly variable source at @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( j2000 ) , lying @xmath63 arcsec nw of the host galaxy nucleus .",
    "we interpret this source as a combination of afterglow plus supernova emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : grb040924_hst ] shows the first epoch , template image and first epoch residual for both the f775w and f850lp filter observations .",
    "there is no evidence for a point source in our third epoch ( template ) images .",
    "we therefore make the reasonable assumption that the transient source flux is negligible at that time .",
    "the resulting _ hst _ photometry is listed in table  [ tab : hst ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : grb040924_sn_curve ] shows the _ hst _ photometry along with our @xmath20- and @xmath21-band afterglow models ( see  [ sec : ag_040924 ] ) and some early - time data compiled from the gcns @xcite , all corrected for galactic extinction . by comparing the afterglow models with the _ hst _ photometry , we find evidence for a @xmath64 magnitude rebrightening at @xmath65 days .",
    "we note that the timescale of this rebrightening is roughly consistent with the peak time of sn1998bw at @xmath0 .",
    "we interpret the observed late - time rebrightening as an associated supernova component .",
    "comparison with our synthesized ( redshifted ) supernova light - curves reveals that an associated sn1998bw - like supernova would be @xmath66 magnitudes brighter than the _ hst _ observation at @xmath65 days , while sn1994i and sn2002ap - like light - curves are fainter by @xmath67 and @xmath66 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "to fit the _ hst _ observations , we add the contribution from a template sn light - curve ( see  [ sec : templates ] ) to the afterglow model .",
    "we allow the brightness of the synthesized template to be scaled but do not allow for the light - curve to be stretched . moreover , we assume the grb and sn exploded at the same time . by fitting the _ hst _ @xmath20- and @xmath21-band data simultaneously , we find a best fit solution ( @xmath68 ) for a sn1998bw - like supernova dimmed by @xmath69 magnitudes ( figure  [ fig : grb040924_sn_curve ] ) .",
    "we note that on this timescale , the supernova emission clearly dominates that of the afterglow model . therefore , even if the afterglow underwent a late - time ( @xmath70 days ) jet break , our supernova fits would not be significantly affected .",
    "host galaxy extinction could affect our sn light - curve fits since it implies the associated sn was more luminous than the observations suggest .",
    "fortunately , we can constrain the host galaxy extinction using optical / ir afterglow observations , since extinction will produce an artificial steepening of the synchrotron spectrum . making the reasonable assumption that the synchrotron cooling frequency was above the optical / ir bands at early - time , we have @xmath71 and thus @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    "the standard blastwave model is violated , therefore implying the spectral index must be steeper than @xmath74 . adopting this limit for the intrinsic spectral index of the afterglow",
    "implies a constraint on the host - galaxy extinction of @xmath75 mag .",
    "this corresponds to limits on the observed extinction of @xmath76 mag , implying the associated sn was at least @xmath11 magnitudes fainter than sn1998bw .",
    "we therefore conclude that the supernova associated with grb040924 was between 1.3 and 1.5 magnitudes fainter than sn1998bw at maximum light , making this event the faintest grb - associated sn ever detected .",

    "apparently , grb / xrf - associated sne are not necessarily over - luminous in comparison with local sne ibc . moreover , by assuming a rough scaling of @xmath4ni production with peak optical magnitude , this implies a notable overlap between the two samples with respect to their dispersion in synthesized material , consistent with the data shown in the upper panel .",
    "the following question naturally arises : are both grb / xrf - associated sne and local sne ibc drawn from the same population of events ? to address this issue , we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test on the two sets of sn peak magnitudes .",
    "our k - s test reveals that the probability the two samples have been drawn from the same parent population is @xmath117 .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that both sne ibc and grb / xrf - associated sne belong to the same sn population , and thus share a common @xmath4ni production mechanism .",
    "this result may imply that grb / xrf - associated sne and local sne ibc share a common progenitor system and/or explosion mechanism .",
    "yet we know from radio observations of local sne that most type ibc s lack the engine - driven relativistic ejecta observed in grbs @xcite . this may be accounted for in the spherical+jet paradigm where the production of @xmath4ni and relativistic ejecta are independent parameters of the explosion , each of which can be individually tuned",
