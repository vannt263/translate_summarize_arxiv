    "radio active galactic nuclei ( agn ) drive shock waves and inflate giant bubbles into the hot , x - ray atmospheres pervading galaxies and clusters ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the enthalpy released as the bubbles rise through hot atmospheres is apparently able to offset radiative cooling @xcite and to regulate the rates at which hot atmospheres condense into stars @xcite .",
    "the rising x - ray bubbles or cavities also drag cool , metal - rich , plasma away from the host galaxy and deposit it on larger scales ( kirkpatrick , mcnamara , & cavagnolo 2011 ) .",
    "the rate with which this hot , metal - rich gas flows is largely unexplored , and thus may be a significant aspect of radio - mode feedback .",
    "cluster atmospheres are replete in heavy elements with average metallicities of approximately 1/3 of the solar value @xcite .",
    "the hot gas became enriched apparently during the early development of clusters , primarily through ejecta from core - collapse supernovae ( sne ii ) associated with star formation .",
    "the atmosphere immediately surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) is chemically enriched above the cluster mean , approaching and sometimes exceeding the solar value @xcite .",
    "this plasma is apparently stripped debris from orbiting galaxies and stellar ejecta from the bcg itself .",
    "being the dominant stellar structure in the core of a cluster , a bcg enriches cluster cores through stellar winds and type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) , a process generating greater quantities of iron compared to sn ii @xcite .",
    "a dichotomy therefore exists between the @xmath5-element enhanced outskirts and the iron - rich core .",
    "were the iron - rich ejecta produced by a bcg lying in a static atmosphere , the stellar light and atmospheric metal concentrations would track each other .",
    "however , several studies have shown that the radial distribution of iron and other metals in cool core clusters is more broadly distributed than the stellar light profile @xcite . evidently , the metals produced by bcgs are transported to higher altitudes .",
    "likely agents include bulk and turbulent motions driven by halo mergers and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "a growing body of data implicate agn .",
    "the virgo and hydra a clusters are archetypes . in m87 , bright , x - ray filaments that are metal enriched with respect to the surrounding gas are draped along the radio jets , indicating that the filaments were lifted out by the jets @xcite . similar structure was found in hydra a but on vastly larger scales exceeding 100 kpc @xcite .",
    "hydra a is experiencing a much more powerful agn outburst compared to the current outburst in m87 , which is why the metal rich gas is seen at such large altitudes .",
    "this phenomenon is observed in rich clusters @xcite and groups , e.g. , hcg 62 @xcite .",
    "a study of ten clusters experiencing radio - agn activity @xcite revealed a power law relationship between jet power and the largest projected radius to which metal - enriched gas is observed .",
    "indications are that persistent agn activity may be largely responsible for enriching the cluster core .    here",
    "we present an analysis of 29 galaxy clusters drawn from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ archive .",
    "the sample was chosen based on the level of agn activity exhibited by x - ray cavities and availability of long exposures needed for accurate gas phase metallicity measurements . in section 2 and 3 we present the entire sample of clusters and discuss preparation of the x - ray data .",
    "section 4 is our analysis and discussion of the sample .",
    "our main goals are to further refine the relationship established by @xcite between jet power and the extent metals are uplifted out of the cluster centre and to test whether or not an agn can be the driving mechanism behind uplifting all the gas originally associated with the bcg and creating the broad abundance peaks we currently observe .",
    "sections 5 is the summary of our results . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath6cdm cosmology with h@xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "all uncertainties are quoted at the 67% confidence level .",
    "twenty nine clusters , found in table  [ tab : main - hqsamp ] , were selected from @xcite and @xcite , most with clear agn activity in the form of x - ray cavities .",
    "the sample is divided into two subsamples , dubbed  high quality \" ( hq ) and  extended \" ( ex ) .",
    "the high quality sample alone is used to comparing jet power to uplifted metals .",
    "this sample is composed of clusters with chandra images deep enough to provide accurate gas metallicity measurements projected on scales smaller than the radio / cavity system .",
    "it includes the original 10 clusters with which the trend between the jet power and iron radius was found @xcite , and an additional six with deep chandra data that have since become available .",
    "the  extended sample \" includes 13 additional systems most of which have x - ray cavity jet power measurements , and central metallicity peaks , but whose chandra images are too shallow to map the metallicity distribution on fine scales .",
    "the two samples are combined to analyze global metallicity properties and for the analysis of growth rates of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) in bcgs , discussed in section 4.4 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     * @xmath11-band luminosity derived from hyperleda catalogue * background metallicity * estimated uplift energy + cavity / shock energy * abundance peak iron mass * change in black hole mass needed to account for total output of energy * enrichment time to create the observed iron mass    to determine if enough energy is available , we measure the change in smbh mass required to output the total energy that went into uplifting all the metal - rich gas to form the abundance peak .",
    "the black hole grows by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the efficiency depending on the spin of the black hole and @xmath14 is the accretion mass .",
    "the black hole spin is important here because it determines the radius of the last stable orbit , which in turn determines the binding energy that can be released .",
    "this efficiency can range from approximately @xmath15 for a non - rotating schwarzschild black hole to as much @xmath16 for a maximal spinning kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "for this analysis we have adopted a standard value of @xmath17 .",
    "accretion mass can be written in terms of the energy released , giving @xmath18 where e is the uplift energy , given from equation  [ eqn : main - energy ] , multiplied by an additional efficiency factor .",
    "the extra efficiency factor is to account for the additional energy put into cavity expansion and shocks during an agn induced outflow .",
    "we know this for each cluster by taking the uplift energy of a single outburst from table  [ tab : outflow_mass - energy ] and comparing it to the total energy output during the lifetime of the outflow .",
    "the average age of outflows in our sample is approximately @xmath19 yr and an average uplift - to - total energy fraction of 14% .",
    "the histogram of black hole mass growth are presented in figure  [ fig : mbh_hist ] and values reported in table  [ tab : main - blackhole ] .",
    "again , the errors here reflect the propagation of uncertainties due to the measured errors on density and metallicity .",
    "it is plausible that all of these smbhs could have grown by this amount .",
    "the range of total black hole growth in our sample are consistent with previous estimations of smbh masses @xcite .",
    "the largest outburst in our sample , ms 0735 , is on the same order growth of what @xcite found to be the maximum growth the smbh must undergo to create the observed cavity system .",
    "when considering the spin of a black hole , the values reported in table  [ tab : main - blackhole ] would be reduced .",
    "less accretion mass is needed in a spinning black hole to maintain the same output , resulting in less overall growth . at the maximal spin rate , the change in black hole mass for every cluster in our sample",
    "would be reduced by an order of magnitude .",
    "it may be surprising at first glance that ms0735 , the system with the most energetic outburst , does not have the largest estimated smbh growth .",
    "however , the mass and overall distribution of iron in a cluster core encodes the power output history of the smbh",
    ". the integrated power of the agn over time will generally exceed the instantaneous power .",
    "the estimated smbh growth found for a1835 is the largest because its abundance peak has the largest iron mass and therefore the largest expended enthalpy .",
    "radio agn outflows may be responsible for the broadly distributed abundance peaks in cool core clusters .",
    "across our sample , it takes on average 2 gyr to produce all the iron enriching the abundance peaks through the process of sn ia explosions , stellar mass loss , and core - collapse supernovae associated with star formation . the change in black hole mass associated with the energy required to uplift gas ranges from @xmath20 - @xmath19 m@xmath3 .",
    "this range is less than the expected masses of smbh in large bcgs and is consistent with previous predictions of expected growth .",
    "adding black hole spin to the calculation lowers the threshold for the amount of accretion material need for equivalent energy output .",
    "we believe because of these easily achievable standards , agn are the prime mechanism for redistributing all the metal enriched gas associated with the bcg .",
    "the hot outflow rates estimated here are comparable to or exceed the star formation rates found in bcgs @xcite .",
    "therefore , outflows of hot gas may play a role in offsetting cooling and regulating star formation .",
    "this conjecture is supported by recent alma discoveries of what appears to be outflowing molecular gas in abell 1835 ( included in this sample ) , and perhaps in abell 1664 @xcite .",
    "similar molecular flows are present in the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "the molecular gas flows are surprisingly large , with masses of @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "the hot and cold outflows may be physically related to each other . as the rising bubbles lift the metal - rich hot gas",
    ", the cooler @xmath23 kev gas may condense into molecular clouds as it rises outward behind the bubble @xcite . an alternative but more challenging possibility",
    "would be that molecular clouds are dragged upward in the wakes of the more massive hot outflows @xcite .",
    "the outflowing hot and cold gas , perhaps associated with a circulating flow @xcite may be delaying or removing gas otherwise destined to fuel star formation in the bcg .",
    "figure  [ fig : outflow_hist ] shows that the total outflowing gas masses lie between @xmath19 m@xmath3 to @xmath24 m@xmath3 across our sample .",
    "we have calculated the associated flow rates for each cluster assuming the gas is traveling at the bubble buoyancy speeds but no greater than the sound speed of the icm .",
    "the hot outflow rates lie between a few solar masses per year for jet powers of @xmath25 to more than @xmath26 for jet powers exceeding @xmath27 . a crude relationship between jet power and outflow rate",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : pjet - mdot ] .",
    "the dashed line indicates the least - squares linear regression of the form , @xmath28 here , jet power is in units of @xmath29 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "the scatter about the mean is large , with a standard deviation of approximately 1.47 dex .",
    "comparing the outflow rate to the enthalpy does nt not improve the scatter .",
    "we compare the outflow rates to the nominal cooling rates of the gas calculated as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the cooling luminosity from @xcite and @xmath32 is the average gas temperature within the cooling radius . in figure",
    "[ fig : flowfrac_hist ] we present a histogram of the ratios of outflow rates to the cooling rate .",
    "while the uncertainties are admittedly large ( as high as 50% ) , the figure shows that outflows are able to remove only 10% to 20% on average of the gas that is expected to cool .",
    "the higher fractions in the histogram are not associated with with higher jet powers , and likely reflect uncertainty in the outflowing gas masses .",
    "this figure shows that hot outflows alone would be unable to remove all of the gas that is expected to cool and to accrete onto the central galaxy .",
    "instead , they may be one part of many processes which regulate the rate of cooling gas which fuel star formation and the nuclear black hole .",
    "the 16 clusters of the high quality sample we have presented here reveal higher metallicities along projected trajectories of their x - ray cavities .",
    "we interpret this effect as the signature of massive , hot outflows of metal - enriched gas produced within the bcg . at the same time",
    "the metallicity maps reveal a great deal of complexity , indicating that other processes , including returning flows of gas , may be taking place .",
    "the outer iron radius is found to scale with jet power as @xmath33 and with cavity enthalpy as @xmath34 .",
    "the jet power relation shows slightly lower scatter .",
    "the mean hot outflow rates are typically tens of solar masses per year and upward of @xmath35 in the extreme .",
    "these flow rates are generally insufficient to balance the radiative cooling rate of a cluster .",
    "recirculation of cooling gas accounts for only 10% to 20% of the radiative cooling rate , so that heating must be more important . nevertheless , the outflow rates are comparable to star formation rates in bcgs , and may have a significant impact on fueling star formation and the agn itself .",
    "using the entire sample , we found that over the life cycle of agn activity , hot outflows may alone be responsible for the broadening of abundance peaks in cool - core clusters , and effectively transport metal - enriched gas from the bcg to great distances in cluster atmospheres . on average ,",
    "only @xmath36 of the energy released by the agn is required to lift the gas from the centre to the observed altitudes .",
    "standard conversions between free energy and rest mass indicate that the smbhs masses must have increased between @xmath37 and @xmath4 m@xmath3 while driving the outflows .",
    "this mass increase lies comfortably within the estimated smbh masses of bcgs , and is therefore a plausible explanation for the extended abundance peaks in clusters .",
