    "this paper deals with the rapid extraction of information on the support of a time- and space - dependent source term in the wave equation from near or far field measurements of the wave radiated ( i.e. , generated ) by that source .",
    "it is well - known that inverse source problems generically are ill - posed and feature non - uniqueness .",
    "this makes it impossible to , e.g. , uniquely determine the source from the measurements , see  @xcite .",
    "it is generally even impossible to state non - trivial upper bounds for the support of any source radiating a given measurement , as adding a non - trivial smooth function with compact support ( away from the region or surface where measurements are taken ) to a given solution yields a new solution that radiates the same measurement .",
    "this motivates to determine sets that are as small as possible and support sources radiating given measurements .",
    "we are particularly interested in fast algorithms solving this task , as the resulting bounds can then be used as input for more accurate reconstruction techniques , e.g. , to increase the computational efficiency of algorithms for time - domain inverse scattering involving time - dependent parameters .    to fix our setting , consider scattering of an incident plane wave @xmath0 with direction @xmath1 and profile @xmath2 from a locally perturbed inhomogeneous medium described by a time - dependent sound speed @xmath3 that equals a constant @xmath4 outside some bounded subset of @xmath5 .",
    "when the incident field hits the perturbation of the background medium described by @xmath6 , there arises a causal scattered field @xmath7 such that the total wave field @xmath8 satisfies the homogeneous wave equation @xmath9 in @xmath10 .",
    "the causal scattered field hence solves @xmath11 if one is interested in numerically identifying the contrast @xmath12 from measurements of @xmath7 , then any set supporting the source @xmath13 ( i.e. , containing @xmath14 ) can be used to set up a discrete parameter space for this searched - for contrast .",
    "this motivates our interest in fast but not necessarily highly accurate algorithms for this task .",
    "the latter task is particularly crucial for the design of efficient inversion algorithms in dynamic inverse problems for the wave equation , where one seeks to determine time- and space - dependent coefficients from time - dependent measurements .",
    "such problems arise for instance when imaging flows via acoustic or electromagnetic waves , or in multi - static ultrasound tomography of moving or deforming objects .",
    "if one aims to use variational or iterative regularization schemes for parameter identification of evolving quantities , then the rapid computation of domains supporting the coefficient variation allows to reduce the dimension of the corresponding parameter space .",
    "this underlines the importance of fast but not highly accurate algorithms for this feature - like reconstruction problem as a possible pre - processing tool .",
    "inverse source problems belong to the core of the research area of inverse problems for differential equations . as discussed above , uniqueness for these problems can only hold under a - priori knowledge ; typically , point - like sources or supports of sources defined on lower - dimensional manifolds can be uniquely identified , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . for time - harmonic waves ,",
    "the convex scattering support of kusiak and sylvester  @xcite provides the smallest convex set that supports a source generating a time - harmonic far field measurements .",
    "( see also  @xcite for extensions to impedance tomography . )",
    "as the latter concept strongly relies on a unique continuation property that is missing for the wave equation , its application to the time - dependent wave equation seems difficult .    in the fourier domain ,",
    "@xcite further present an efficient approach to determine supports of sources for the time - harmonic wave equation based on the radon transform .",
    "nevertheless , transforming time - domain measurements to the fourier domain does not always seem to be the better alternative to tackle inverse source problems , as this makes detection of moving objects impossible , prevents to exploit time - space structure of wave propagation , and requires detector measurements for ( essentially ) all times .",
    "concerning inverse problems for the time - dependent wave equation , there are various theoretic tools to prove unique determination or stability results ; exemplarily , we refer to carleman estimates @xcite and the boundary control method @xcite , both of which can also be exploited numerically . as all these references deal with static coefficients , we also like to highlight several works for time- and space - dependent coefficients or obstacles  @xcite , all providing either uniqueness or stability results .",
    "we finally would like to point to a series of papers by friedlander  @xcite on the wave equation , the far field of its solutions , and related inverse problems .",
    "particular important for our results are bounds from  @xcite for the support of a source radiating a given far field measurement .    _ notation : _ the ball of radius @xmath15 centered at the origin is denoted as @xmath16 and the projection of @xmath17 onto @xmath18 is @xmath19 . for an open set @xmath20 , @xmath21",
