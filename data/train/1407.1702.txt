    "the creation of various self - trapped modes ( loosely called solitons \" in this paper ) in many physical systems is complicated by competition between self - focusing ( sf ) and self - defocusing ( sdf )  nonlinearities .",
    "the first example , which was studied in detail , is the competition between the second - harmonic - generating , i.e. , quadratic , and cubic nonlinearities in optics . in such systems ,",
    "the adjustment of the mismatch between the fundamental and second harmonics makes it possible to render the quadratic nonlinearity effectively self - focusing , while the cubic term may be self - defocusing .",
    "the interplay of these competing interactions gives rise to diverse soliton states , both one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a subject of many works was the competition between cubic sf and quintic sdf  terms .",
    "the cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity  usually , with opposite signs of the two terms  occurs in the various photonic media .",
    "known examples include the light propagation in diverse fluids @xcite , specialty glasses @xcite , ferroelectric films @xcite , and colloidal suspensions of metallic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "the colloids offer remarkable flexibility , making it possible to adjust parameters of the cq nonlinearity ( the signs and magnitudes of both the cubic and quintic terms ) through the selection of the diameter of the nanoparticles and the filling factor of the suspension .",
    "the realization of the cq nonlinearity was also theoretically elaborated in terms of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite for bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , where the quintic term accounts for three - body collisions , provided that inelastic effects may be neglected @xcite . in this context , the adjustment of the nonlinearity may be provided by the feshbach resonance which affects the sign and strength of the cubic term @xcite .    it has been theoretically demonstrated that the use of the cq nonlinearity combining the sf and sdf terms opens a way to the creation of stable multidimensional solitons , including 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite self - trapped vortices , see a review in ref .",
    "recently , 2d fundamental solitons of this type were produced experimentally in colloidal waveguides @xcite .",
    "the use of the cq nonlinearity is necessary for this purpose , because the sf  cubic interaction can create only the family of _ townes solitons _ in the 2d setting , which is fully destabilized by the occurrence of the critical collapse in the same geometry @xcite .",
    "the townes family is degenerate , in the sense that the norm ( total power ) of the solitons takes the single value , which does not depend on the propagation constant .",
    "however , the 2d system including the sdf quintic term suppresses the collapse and thus lends stability to the self - trapped states , with both the fundamental and vortical internal structure @xcite .",
    "a degenerate family the townes - like solitons , subject to the instability driven by the critical collapse , is known in the 1d setting as well .",
    "it is described by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with the quintic sf term , in the absence of cubic ones @xcite .",
    "the addition of the sf cubic nonlinearity does not eliminate the collapse , but it lifts the degeneracy and stabilizes all the solitons against small perturbations pelin .",
    "it is well known too that , while the 1d nls equation with the cq combination of nonlinear terms is not integrable , it admits an exact analytical solutions for the full soliton family @xcite .",
    "a remarkable peculiarity of the 1d nls equation is that it admits another type of the nonlinearity , which gives rise to another degenerate soliton family , that may also be considered as a variety of the townes solitons .",
    "this equation contains the sf  cubic nonlinear term concentrated , in the ideal form , at a single spatial point , @xmath2 , i.e. , multiplied by dirac s delta - function , @xmath0 .",
    "this model was introduced in ref .",
    "azbel , and it was later shown that the entire family of the solitons , whose norm does not depend on the propagation constant either ( the characteristic feature of solitons of the townes type ) , is completely unstable @xcite .",
    "lifting of the degeneracy , and partial or complete stabilization of the latter family is possible in the system with two @xmath3-functions @xcite , or if the ideal @xmath1-function is replaced by its finite - width counterpart @xcite .",
    "the fact that two different nonlinear terms in the 1d  nls equation , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the complex wave field , give rise to townes - like soliton families is a unique feature of the 1d setting , which is explained by the coinciding _ scaling dimension _ of both these terms .",
    "this circumstance suggests to consider a general family of the townes solitons , produced by the 1d nls equation including both terms . in this work",
    ", we demonstrate that such a family can be found in an exact form , and it remains degenerate ( with the norm independent of the propagation constant ) , hence it is unstable too .",
    "in fact , another situation is more interesting , which is the main subject of the present work , _",
    "viz_. , the competition between such cubic sf and quintic sdf  terms , which still share the identical scaling dimension .",
    "this situation is relevant to both physical settings mentioned above : in optical waveguides , the local cubic nonlinearity may be induced by means of locally implanted resonant dopants @xcite , while in bec it can be implemented by means of the feshbach resonance imposed by a tightly focused laser beam @xcite .",
    "the most interesting issue to be considered in the framework of these systems is the stability of solitons .",
    "we conclude that , in the case of the ideal dirac s @xmath1-function multiplying the sf cubic term , the soliton family can be found in an exact analytical form , remaining degenerate and unstable .",
    "however , the regularization , which replaces the ideal @xmath1-function by an approximation with a finite intrinsic scale , immediately stabilizes the entire family .",
    "this result , which is meaningful in terms of the above - mentioned physical realizations , as any locally induced nonlinearity has a finite spatial size , is obtained below by means of a combination of numerical and analytical methods .",
    "interestingly , parts of the soliton families for which the sf or sdf term is the dominant one , turn out to be stable , severally , in accordance with the _ vakhitov - kolokolov _ ( vk ) criterion @xcite or the _ anti - vk _",
    "one @xcite . as concerns analytical methods",
    ", we use the perturbation theory , the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) , and also produce particular exact solutions in the model with the regularized @xmath1-function . using numerical methods",
    ", we subsequently extend the analysis to the system with two regularized @xmath1-functions , and , finally , to the 2d version of the model , with both the single and double regularized @xmath7-functions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the 1d system is formulated in section ii , where we present the basic equations and analytical solutions .",
    "numerical and additional analytical results for the 1d systems , with the single and double regularized @xmath1-functions , are reported in section iii .",

    "<S> we also consider the system with a symmetric pair of regularized @xmath1-functions , which gives rise to a wealth of symmetric , antisymmetric , and asymmetric solitons , linked by a bifurcation loop , that accounts for the breaking and restoration of the symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> the 1d and 2d settings may be realized for spatial solitons in optics , and in bose - einstein condensates . </S>"
