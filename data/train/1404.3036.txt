    "distributed generation of electricity has been touted by national and international agencies , such as , the organisation for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) @xcite , as a possible means to incorporate nascent technologies into the energy market .",
    "some of these technologies rely on renewable sources , e.g. wind and solar , but they are still severely limited by high production costs . for this reason , more established technologies continue to attract significant attention .",
    "one such technology is called combined heat and power ( chp ) where the excess heat generated in electricity production is recycled to improve the overall efficiency of the process .",
    "chp systems have traditionally made use of steam turbines , gas turbines , reciprocating engines and , more recently , solid oxide fuel cells ( sofcs ) @xcite .",
    "the latter are particularly interesting given their high efficiency ( up to 85% ) , low pollutant emissions and fuel flexibility ( they can utilize hydrogen , natural gas , landfill gas , gasified coal , etc @xcite ) ; thus , sofcs have the potential to play a key role in the energy conversion landscape for the medium and long term future @xcite .",
    "commercial applications of sofcs could range from domestic units to small power stations .",
    "nonetheless , widespread use of sofcs has been held back by their high operating temperature , which requires the use of expensive materials and affects the long - term performance of these devices .",
    "substantial research efforts have been devoted to lowering their operating regime to between 500 to 750 c@xmath1 , known as the intermediate temperature ( it ) range @xcite .",
    "there are two processes which limit significantly the performance of it - sofcs , namely the oxygen reduction reaction ( orr ) at the cathode and the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte .",
    "this article focuses on the latter effect as a means to improve the performance of sofc electrolytes , in particular those based on doped ceria ( ceo@xmath0 ) .",
    "fluorite - structured materials , such as ceo@xmath2 , zro@xmath2 and @xmath3-bi@xmath2o@xmath4 are among the best oxide ion conductors , which makes them ideal candidates for use as electrolytes in it - sofcs .",
    "the conduction mechanism in these ceramics is known to occur by means of vacancy migration in the anion sublattice @xcite .",
    "oxygen vacancies are introduced by doping these materials with lower valent cations - bi@xmath2o@xmath4 actually behaves differently , since this material already has 25% intrinsic vacancies . in this case doping with iso - valent cations",
    "is used to stabilise the fluorite structure at low temperatures @xcite . ] .",
    "for example , ceo@xmath2 is usually doped with rare earth cations ( re = lanthanides + sc and y ) which leads to the formation of one vacancy ( @xmath5 ) for each pair of cations , as illustrated by equation [ eq : vac_form ] , in krger - vink notation @xcite :    @xmath6    the formation of oxygen vacancies has a beneficial effect on the conductivity , which shows , at first , a marked increase as more vacancies are added .",
    "this increase , however , does not display a monotonic behaviour , but rather , a sharp drop in conductivity is observed beyond a critical concentration . in the case of ceria , this value varies between 2.5 and 5 % vacancy concentration , depending on the dopant cation species , the temperature and other factors .",
    "there is a general consensus that this drop in conductivity with increased number of vacancies is caused by defect ",
    "defect interactions @xcite .",
    "the interactions between these defects can be broadly classified into cation - vacancy , vacancy - vacancy and cation - cation @xcite . in practice",
    ", these interactions can prove deleterious to the ionic conductivity because defect association leads to fewer mobile vacancies being available @xcite , thus the need for high operating temperatures .",
    "this process is generally summarised by the following formula for the conductivity , @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the temperature , @xmath10 the composition - dependent pre - exponential factor , @xmath11 the activation energy and @xmath12 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the activation energy is given by the sum of a migration enthalpy , @xmath13 , and a defect association enthalpy @xmath14 .",
    "the higher the association enthalpy , the lower the conductivity .",
    "traditionally , ionic conductivity optimization has been approached from a compositional perspective .",
    "this has meant that , in order to improve the conductivity of ceria - based electrolytes , researchers have mostly focused on parameters such as the ionic radius of the dopant cation and its concentration , @xmath15 in ce@xmath16re@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "the chief aim has been to minimize defect interactions , especially those between dopants and vacancies @xcite .",
    "these studies have variously identified a number of re elements , such as gd@xmath19 , y@xmath19 , sm@xmath19 and pm@xmath19 as the best candidate dopants , given that their radius mismatch with the host cation ( ce@xmath20 ) balances the competing electrostatic and elastic components of the defect interactions which control their association @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies have shown that in the limit where cation - vacancy interactions are reduced to a minimum , it is vacancy - vacancy association which ultimately determines the ionic conductivity drop as a function of dopant concentration in fluorite - structured materials , such as , yttria doped ceria ( ydc ) @xcite , yttria stabilized zirconia ( ysz ) and scandia stabilized zirconia ( scsz ) @xcite .",
    "this means that different optimization strategies must be sought if it - sofcs are to realize their potential in commercial applications @xcite .",
    "an interesting route for improving the ionic conductivity of fluorite - structured electrolytes is co - doping , i.e. doping these materials with more than one cation species .",
    "this approach was employed on zro@xmath0 by politova and irvine @xcite with two different cation species , each playing a different role . in this case ,",
    "the material was doped with two different cation species , where each of which played a _",
    "different _ role .",
    "sc was added to improve the ionic conductivity , since its radius is very close to that of zr , thus minimizing cation - vacancy interactions ; while y , on the other hand , was introduced because its larger ionic radius fully stabilizes the fluorite structure and removes a phase transition to a lower - symmetry phase observed in pure sc - doped zro@xmath0 .",
    "it is important to note that y addition to sc - doped zro@xmath0 _ lowers _ the conductivity of this material .",
    "therefore , a _ compromise _ exists between stability and ionic conductivity in this co - doped zirconia system . in the case of politova and irvine",
    ", the authors found that very _",
    "small _ concentrations of y are necessary to stabilize the cubic fluorite structure and that this has a small effect on the conductivity .    it has been suggested that co - doping can also be used to improve the ionic conductivity of ceria based electrolytes  @xcite . however , contrary to the stabilizing role it plays in zirconia , co - doping in ceria has been used in order to either reproduce the ionic radius of an ideal dopant , or the lattice constant of ceria doped with said dopant .",
    "co - doping with two or more different cations aims to obtain an _ average _ or `` effective '' cation radius that is very close to that of ce@xmath20 , hence the average strain introduced by the dopant cations is minimized .",
    "this is substantiated by different interpretations of how a dopant with a critical radius ( @xmath21 ) is likely to affect defect  defect interactions .",
    "for example , in 1989 kim suggested that the ideal dopant would not change the volume of the host lattice upon its introduction , thus minimizing the elastic strain , and identified @xmath22 = 1.038  @xcite .",
    "more recently , researchers have had access to a more detailed view of the interplay between strain and electrostatics with the use of _ ab initio _ methods , which in 2006 lead andersson _",
    "_ @xcite to ascertain that @xmath21 should be that which maximizes oxygen vacancy disorder .",
    "their simulations showed that when ceria is doped with relatively small cations , vacancies prefer to sit in a nearest neighbour ( nn ) position with respect to the dopant cation , whereas , for larger cations , vacancies prefer to sit in a next nearest neighbour ( nnn ) position .",
    "the crossover between these two tendencies was observed at pm@xmath19 , for which the nn and nnn positions have the same energy , which was rationalized in terms of a perfect balance between the elastic ( related to the dopant s radius ) and coulombic interactions between pm@xmath19 and a vacancy .",
    "this finding implies that pm@xmath19 is the ideal dopant for ceria because it increases the configurational entropy and should display the highest ionic conductivity .",
    "unfortunately , pm@xmath19 is radioactive , so the authors suggested , instead , to try a mixture of sm / nd which have slightly smaller / larger ionic radii than pm@xmath19 .",
    "based on these ideas , multiple research groups have carried out experiments in order to test several co - doping schemes for ceria , e.g. y / sm co - doping  @xcite , la / y co - doping  @xcite , lu / nd co - doping  @xcite and sm / nd co - doping  @xcite , of which the latter two were specifically aimed at reproducing the @xmath22 values predicted by kim and by andersson , respectively . in general ,",
    "co - doping studies have pointed to increases in the ionic conductivity with respect to singly doped systems , which has lead to the conclusion that there exists a `` co - doping '' effect in ceria .",
    "modern simulation techniques have become a mainstay within the materials science community , not only because they afford researchers information which is complementary to their experiments , but also because they can serve as predictive tools @xcite .",
    "hence , the implementation of reliable computer simulations can be used to clarify the role of particular effects present in physical experiments in a targeted and controlled manner .",
    "to this end , the interaction potentials reported here are shown to perform with the accuracy of state - of - the - art _ first - principles _ calculations , i.e. hybrid density functional therory ( dft ) , but at the computational cost of classical ( polarizable ) molecular dynamics .",
    "this approach allows us to study systems with realistic doped / co - doped defect concentrations within the temperatures of interest for sofc applications ( 600 - 1000 c@xmath1 ) , and to accumulate sufficiently long trajectories to calculate the conductivity .",
    "this is in contrast to most of the previous computational work on doped ceria which has typically used static dft calculations or emprirical potentials fitted to equilibrium properties @xcite .",
    "the use of computer simulations allows us to focus on the _ bulk _ behaviour of this material , excluding factors like grain size and boundaries , sintering conditions , impurity levels , etc , which are known to also ( negatively ) affect the conductivity of these materials @xcite .",
    "we show that co - doping does not significantly improve the conductivity of these materials , but rather , we find that the conductivity of the co - doped systems lies within the range spanned by the singly doped systems , i.e. it is an average of the two .",
    "the reason for this is that introducing two cation species with radii which are bigger or smaller than that of a given @xmath21 affects the local structure of ceria and results in deep traps for the vacancies .",
    "the highly correlated nature of the @xmath23-electrons found in lanthanide elements makes necessary the use of high levels of theory in order to correctly describe their electronic structure .",
    "such demands have been found to be satisfied by the inclusion of a fraction of non - local hartree - fock exchange within the framework of density funcional theory ( dft ) , which gives rise to hybrid functionals ( h - dft ) @xcite .",
    "alternative dft functionals are also available , namely , those which include a hubbard parameter @xmath24 ( dft@xmath25 ) .",
    "they represent a viable alternative to h - dft and their ability to describe the properties of ceria has been widely documented @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , h - dft provides a better agreement with experimental lattice constants and does not require fitting a @xmath25 value for the @xmath23-electron systems . in either case ,",
    "however , dft calculations are prohibitively expensive from a computational point of view for this type of study regardless of the functional ; this is because of the long molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation times and large systems required to study the ionic conductivity of doped ceria .",
    "for this reason interionic potentials ( ip ) implemented in an in - house md code ( pimaim ) @xcite and derived from static h - dft calculations were used in this work , as they accurately reproduce the structural _ ab initio _ data at a fraction of the computational cost .",
    "this approach has been successfully used for a series of related oxides @xcite , including y - doped ceria @xcite , as well as a variety of ionic systems @xcite .",
    "the re dopant cations studied in this article included la , nd , sm and gd , as well as , sc . a crucial feature of this potential set is that they were fitted with a _",
    "common _ o  o term , which made it possible to perform simulations with several dopant cations within the same cell , i.e. to co - dope ceria .",
    "details on the interionic potential used ( dippim - dipole polarizable ionic model ) , its parameterization and the parameters used are found in appendix [ dippim ] and appendix [ parameterization ] , respectively .",
    "all md simulations on the singly doped ce@xmath16re@xmath17o@xmath18 and co - doped systems were performed using 6 @xmath26 6 @xmath26 6 supercells ( @xmath27 2592 atoms , depending on the dopant concentration ) .",
    "two different co - doped systems formed part of this study .",
    "firstly , ce@xmath16nd@xmath28sm@xmath28o@xmath18 , which has been previously studied experimentally @xcite because the average radius of both dopants matches that of pm .",
    "similarly , ce@xmath16sc@xmath29la@xmath30o@xmath18 was included given that this ratio of la and sc also reproduces the ionic radius of pm .",
    "three different supercells were set up for each dopant concentration , @xmath31 = 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 , 0.25 and the values reported here , such as , ionic conductivities , lattice constants and activation energies were obtained from the averages of these three configurations .",
    "each calculation was set up by randomly distributing the dopants over the cation sublattice and the oxygen vacancies over the anion sublattice .",
    "the supercells were initially equilibrated at a temperature of 1673k for 40 ps ; the temperature was then scaled down to room temperature at a rate of 2k ps@xmath32 .",
    "the diffusion coefficients were calculated for temperatures between 873k and 1473k from simulations that were up to 3ns long in the case of the lowest temperature .",
    "the 300k lattice constants were obtained from 10 ps long runs .",
    "all simulations were performed at constant temperature and pressure ( npt ensemble ) , as described by martyna et al .",
    "@xcite using a time step of 1 fs . the coulombic and dispersion interactions were summed using ewald summations @xcite , while the short - range part of the potential was truncated at 12.96  .",
    "the reliability of the models used in the computer simulations presented throughout this work is assessed in section [ assesment ] by means of comparison against experimental and computational results for singly doped ceria .",
    "we also note that this approach has already been successfully used to model yttria - doped ceria , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . section [ co - doped ] builds upon these results to determine whether co - doping is likely to improve the ionic conductivity in these solid electrolytes .",
    "the remainder of this article abbreviates the various re - doped ceria systems ( ce@xmath16re@xmath17o@xmath18 ) under study to scdc , gddc , smdc , nddc and ladc . in a similar fashion , the co - doped systems",

    ", the use of hybrid dft functionals means that errors in the calculated value of lattice constants with respect to experiment for doped ceria should be in the order of 0.20% @xcite .",
    "this is borne out by the results presented in figure [ a0 - 300k ] , which show an excellent agreement with the range of experimental data available in the literature and also with the values calculated using hong and virkar s equation . in the case of scdc ,",
    "the simulations provide a better estimation of the lattice constant than that obtained from hong and virkar with respect to experiment , however both models underestimate the value of @xmath36 . for dippim simulations of scdc ,",
    "the largest error is 0.45% compared to the value from grover _ et al .",

    "the colours differentiate the concentration of the dopant cations as a percentage , thus 5% is shown in black , 10% in blue , 15% in orange , 20% in green and 25% in magenta . in agreement with the literature for singly doped ceria",
    ", the best dopants were found to be gd and sm @xcite . in particular ,",
    "gddc was found to have the highest conductivity at all temperatures .",
    "the results also show that the concentration which gives the highest conductivity varies from one doped system to another for a particular temperature .",
    "however 10% gddc is consistently among the systems that display the highest conductivity .",
    "in addition , the errors associated with each measurement become larger at lower temperatures because of the slower diffusion . as was mentioned above",
    ", sc is soluble in ceria only in small amounts , hence the results presented here for a fluorite structure with randomly distributed cations correspond to an idealized description of scdc .",
    "the dashed red line ( vertical ) shown in figure [ sigalltemps ] represents andersson s critical ionic radius @xcite ( @xmath39 ) for the ideal dopant cation .",
    "figure [ sig873k ] focuses on the dippim simulated ionic conductivities at 873k for the systems already presented and puts them in the context of a range of conductivity values from other studies for the same singly doped ceria ( ce@xmath33re@xmath34o@xmath35 ) systems at the same temperature .",
    "the value for sc is not included in this plot as there are no data available in the literature for the selected concentration and temperature .",
    "individual literature values are labelled a ) to m ) , with open symbols indicating experimental values and filled symbols those from other computational studies .",
    "this figure shows that there is a significant spread in the experimental data set , as exemplified by gddc whose conductivities vary by a factor of 2.5 ( from 0.01s / cm @xcite to 0.025s / cm @xcite ) .",
    "such fluctuations are typically ascribed to different fabrication methods , sintering times and temperatures , grain sizes and impurities @xcite , all of which are excluded from the our computational bulk models .",
    "nonetheless , what is clear from figure [ sig873k ] is that the dippim potentials used in this work deliver conductivity values which lie in the lower end of the range of the experimental ones , but constitute a good predictor of the overall tendencies in doped ceria .",
    "the calculated e@xmath40 values for these systems are shown in figure [ ea-10pc ] ( filled black circles ) as a function of dopant ionic radius and were obtained from simulations between 1473k and 873k .",
    "the plots of ln(@xmath41 ) vs 1/@xmath9 within this range of temperatures were found to be linear for all dopants .",
    "this is important as it indicates that there is no extensive clustering of dopants and vacancies , which would occur if the simulations spanned both sides of the critical temperature ( @xmath42 ) below which nucleation centres form around the dopants leading to progressive trapping of the vacancies into such clusters as the temperature decreases @xcite .",
    "if the calculations had been carried out at sufficiently low temperatures ( @xmath43 856k for gddc @xcite ) , then two different e@xmath40 values would have been obtained for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 temperature regimes .",
    "for this reason , the literature data presented in figure [ ea-10pc ] corresponds to the @xmath44 region only .",
    "experimental values are distinguished with the same open symbols from figure [ sig873k ] and labelled a ) to o ) . just as was found to be the case with ionic conductivities ,",
    "figure [ ea-10pc ] illustrates that the self - consistent dippim potentials used in this work are able to predict the activation energies for the various re dopants used in this study .",
    "this is particularly impressive since no experimental data were used at any stage of the potential parameterization .",
    "we can therefore proceed to study co - doping in this material , with the confidence that the employed simulation technique can reliably predict the properties of these materials .",

    "the co - doped systems shown correspond to an effective dopant cation radius of 1.093  for the stoichiometries specified in section [ sect : simus ] .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the calculations predict the correct lattice constant for the singly doped systems over the entire composition range , and that this carries over to the co - doped cerias under study .",
    "the agreement is particularly good for the systems that are the focus of this study , namely ce@xmath33re@xmath34o@xmath35 .",
    "the results show that co - doping can be successfully used to reproduce the lattice constant of a cation with a critical dopant radius , @xmath22 .",
    "thus far the results presented for the ionic conductivity of singly doped ceria have shown only progressive changes in both the bulk ionic conductivities and activation energies as a function of dopant ionic radius .",
    "hence , the question of whether co - doping is a viable alternative for substantially improving these properties becomes : _ do co - doped systems show a marked increase ( decrease ) in ionic conductivity ( activation energy ) or is this property simply the average of the singly doped systems ? _        to answer this question it is necessary to compare directly the ionic conductivity of the co - doped systems with that of their `` parent '' singly doped ceria compounds . hence if there exists a co - doping effect it would be expected that such systems display ionic conductivities that are higher than the average of the values obtained for singly doped ceria .",
    "these data are shown in figure [ sigavg ] ( a ) for the sc : ladc system and figure [ sigavg ] ( b ) for nd : smdc .",
    "the data in these plots is presented as a ratio of the calculated conductivities for the co - doped systems ( @xmath46 ) with respect to the weighted average for the singly doped parent compounds with the same total number of dopant cations ( @xmath47 ) .",

    "the solid red line indicates a linear correspondence between both data sets ( co - doped vs weighted average of singly doped ) , i.e. no co - doping effect .",
    "it is clear from these plots that any deviations in @xmath46 away from the @xmath47 values are within the margin of error of these measurements ( standard deviation ) .",
    "this indicates that the conductivities of co - doped ceria can be predicted by simply calculating the average of the two parent singly doped cerias for all temperatures and dopant concentrations .",
    "accordingly , it is expected that the corresponding activation energies for the ionic conductivity of co - doped ceria display the same averaging effect .",
    "this is confirmed in figure [ ea-10pc - codoped ] , which depicts the dippim @xmath48 ( ev ) for ce@xmath33re@xmath34o@xmath35 from figure [ ea-10pc ] ( filled black circles ) , along with those for the co - doped systems , nd : smdc ( filled blue triangle ) and sc : ladc ( filled black triangle ) .",

    "the simple , yet often overlooked , explanation for these patterns is found by analyzing the local structure around the dopants in these systems as shown in the next section .",

    "the results in figure [ scladc - cvrdfs ] and table [ table : cv - integ ] clearly show that the local environment , and thus the local strain , of the dopant cations undergoes few changes in going from singly doped systems to those with more than one dopant species .",

    "these positions can then be used to calculate partial radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) , from which vacancy ordering in real space can be studied .",
    "integration of the vacancy - vacancy rdf ( @xmath51 ) peaks from zero out to the position @xmath52 gives the vacancy - vacancy coordination number , @xmath53 :      where @xmath55 is the vacancy density in the simulation cell .",
    "this method has been previously used to study similar materials , such as , zr@xmath0y@xmath0o@xmath56y@xmath38nbo@xmath56 @xcite , ydc @xcite and pbo@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "<S> has given rise to claims of much improved performance . </S>",
    "<S> the present study makes use of computer simulations to investigate the bulk ionic conductivity of rare earth ( re ) doped ceria , where re = sc , gd , sm , nd and la . the results from the singly doped systems are compared to those from ceria co - doped with nd / sm and sc / la . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern that emerges from the conductivity data is consistent with the dominance of local lattice strains from individual defects , rather than the synergistic co - doping effect reported recently and , as a result no enhancement in the conductivity of co - doped samples is observed . </S>"
