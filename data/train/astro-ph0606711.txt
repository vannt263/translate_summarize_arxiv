    "understanding the formation of our galaxy has always been one of the key quests in modern astrophysics for decades . during the last decade ,",
    "a tremendous amount of observational data have accumulated regarding the formation of our galaxy , in particular due to the advent of hst .",
    "however , questions associated with the formation and early evolution of our galaxy remain unanswered .",
    "one of the earliest models for the formation of the galaxy was that of eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage ( 1962 ) , who postulated a rapid , monolithic  collapse \" of a proto - galaxy . using similar data , isobe ( 1974 ) and saio & yoshii ( 1979 ) suggested the formation process could have been much longer than a free - fall timescale , occurring over several billion years .",
    "an alternate view of the halo formation process was presented by searle & zinn ( 1979 ) . under the assumption that variations in the numbers of blue and red horizontal branch stars in globular clusters is an age indicator , they argued for somewhat more youthful clusters at larger galactocentric distances .",
    "if true , they argued that the galactic halo may have formed from accretion of  proto - galactic fragments \" , implying a more chaotic view of the halo s formation . carrying the argument further , zinn ( 1993 ) argued that the bulk of the old halo globular clusters formed during a monolithic dissipative collapse while the young halo globular clusters formed independently of the galaxy and later accreted into our galaxy .",
    "the longer timescale of a monolithic formation process and the fragmentary accretion model both suggest a variation in the ages of globular clusters , and a natural assumption is that the galactic halo may have formed  inside - out \" , with star formation beginning earlier in center due to the smaller free collapse time scale ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the discoveries that the universe s expansion and self - gravity are dominated by dark energy and dark matter have led to the basic  @xmath7cdm \" model , and the formation of galaxies within this model is a much more elaborate yet tractable variant of the original searle & zinn ( 1978 ) hypothesis , and that of white & rees ( 1978 ) .",
    "numerous sub - galactic mass concentrations form rapidly in the early universe , and undergo mergers to form the larger galaxies we see today ( see navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) .",
    "mergers are still going on in the current epoch , in our own milky way galaxy , and in many others as well .",
    "qualitatively , this  hierarchical assembly \" model implies an  inside - out \" formation of our galaxy , and detailed calculations show this to be the case for the dark matter ( helmi et al .",
    "2003 ) and the stars as well ( robertson et al .  2005 ; font et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "what do we know about how when star formation began and how rapidly it proceeded in these fragments and the young galaxy ?",
    "two techniques are available to answer these questions .",
    "element - to - iron ( or other elemental ) ratios provide valuable clues due to different elements different nucleosynthesis sites .",
    "for example , light elements such as magnesium , calcium , and silicon are manufactured more readily in short - lived stars that explode as type ii supernovae , whereas iron is more readily synthesized in type ia supernovae , which are thought to arise from mass transfer or mergers of white dwarfs , a process which is thought to require a longer period of time , perhaps @xmath8 years or more .",
    "thus in a closed system of stars and gas , stars with high [ @xmath9/fe ] abundance ratios were likely born prior to significant contributions from type ia supernovae .",
    "the discovery that the galaxy s dwarf spheroidal galaxy neighbors have unusually low [ @xmath9/fe ] ratios , even at very low [ fe / h ] values ( shetrone et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; venn et al .",
    "2004 ) thereby presented a challenge to the idea that the galaxy s halo was assembled from proto - galactic fragments , since , apparently , some of the surviving fragments have not shared the same chemical enrichment history as the galactic halo .",
    "the difficulty with relying on element - to - iron ratios is that they do not monitor ages directly .",
    "small galaxies producing stars very slowly will experience enrichment from type ia supernovae before the overall [ fe / h ] value has risen significantly .",
    "further , incorporation of supernovae ejecta in subsequent generations of stars depends on the host galaxy s ability to retain gas .",
    "font et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that the @xmath7cdm model is able to explain the differences in [ @xmath9/fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] patterns in the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies vs.  the galactic halo due to the different rates of star formation in the systems that were absorbed by the galaxy compared to the survivors .",
    "the second method of age dating is the most direct : comparisons of main sequence turn - offs with stellar model isochrones .",
    "while the derived ages do not depend on the history of nucleosynthesis , the method is difficult to apply with the same level of precision .",
    "for example , if the timescale for significant contributions of type ia supernovae to manifest their presence in subsequent generations of stars , a change in [ @xmath9/fe ] can be expected to be revealed in stars whose ages differ by less than @xmath8 years _ in a closed system_. measurement of even relative ages with such precision using main sequence data is very challenging .",
    "nonetheless , much careful work has already been done in this area .",
    "we are interested in the particular question of how rapidly did star formation begin throughout the galaxy and its then more numerous proto - galactic fragment .",
    "the hst observations of one of the most remote metal - poor halo clusters ngc  2419 ( @xmath10 @xmath5 90 kpc ) of harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that ngc  2419 and m92 ( @xmath10 = 9.6 kpc ) essentially have the same age within @xmath112 gyr , suggesting that globular - cluster formation must have started at everywhere at about the same time in our galaxy ( richer et al .",
    "1996 ; see also the counterargument of chaboyer , demarque , & sarajedini 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , the local dwarf galaxies carina ( mighell 1997 ) , draco ( grillmair et al . 1998 ) , leo i & ii ( held et al .",
    "2000 ; mighell & rich 1996 ) , and ursa minor ( mighell & burke 1999 ) and the globular clusters in the fornax dwarf galaxy ( buonanno et al .",
    "1998 ) , lmc ( johnson et al . 1999 ) , and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( montegriffo et al . 1998",
    "; layden & sarajedini 2000 ) appear to be coeval with typical globular clusters of similar metallicity in our galaxy .",
    "these similar ages suggest that globular cluster formation may have begun everywhere at the same time not only in our galaxy but also in the local dwarf galaxies , despite the differences in the initial physical environments .",
    "the  inside - out \" model led van den bergh ( 1993 ) to suggest that the most metal - poor globular cluster near the galactic center ngc  6287 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath122.01 , lee & carney 2002 ; @xmath10 = 1.6 kpc , lee et al .",
    "2001 ) may be the oldest globular cluster in our galaxy , based on its metallicity , horizontal branch ( hb ) population , and its spatial location in our galaxy .",
    "the recent hst nic3 observations of the cluster ( lee et al .",
    "2001 ) have shown that ngc  6287 and m92 essentially have the same age within @xmath112 gyr , suggesting that the metal - poor globular cluster formation must have been triggered roughly everywhere at the same time in our galaxy .",
    "it should be noted that , however , hst nic3 photometry can be vulnerable to the variation in the intrapixel sensitivity ( lauer 1999 ) and the temperature dependence of the interstellar reddening law in the hst nicmos f110w / f160w photometric system ( lee et al .",
    "therefore , a photometric study with an expanded sample , preferably employing detector plus filter systems not suffering such effects as can be seen in hst nic3 , is necessary to rank the formation epoch of metal - poor inner halo globular clusters in comparison to the intermediate or the outer halo globular clusters .",
    "ngc  6293 ( @xmath9 = 17:10:10.42 ; @xmath13 = @xmath14:34:54.2 ; @xmath15 = 357.62 ; @xmath16 = + 7.83 ) and ngc  6541 ( @xmath9 = 18:08:02.20 ; @xmath13 = @xmath17:42:19.7 ; @xmath15 = 349.29 ; @xmath16 = @xmath18 ) are the second and the third most metal - poor globular clusters within 3 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 are located @xmath5 1.4 kpc and 2.2 kpc from the galactic center and @xmath5 1.2 kpc and @xmath121.4 kpc from the galactic plane , suffering interstellar reddening of @xmath1 = 0.41 and 0.14 , respectively ( harris 1996 ) . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we list clusters properties .",
    "since both clusters are thought to be post core - collapsed , as can be more frequently found in the inner halo region than other parts of our galaxy ( barbuy , bica , & ortolani 1998 ) , ground - based photometric study of these two clusters has been limited .",
    "janes & heasley ( 1991 ) presented @xmath19 photometry of ngc  6293 .",
    "their color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) showed that the red - giant branch ( rgb ) and the bhb morphologies of ngc  6293 are similar to those of m92 , indicating that the cluster is both old and metal - poor . by comparing with m92",
    ", they suggested that @xmath1 = 0.46 and @xmath20 16.0 . since their observations reached just to the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) , however , they were not able to address the age of the cluster .",
    "they also made an interesting point that the rgb - tip magnitude of ngc  6293 appears to be a full magnitude fainter than that of m92 .",
    "they suggested that this may reflect that the cluster has undergone core collapse .",
    "trager et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that the cluster has indeed undergone core collapse , as may ngc  6541 .",
    "more recent work by noyola & gebhardt ( 2006 ) , relying on hst wfpc2 data , confirms that both clusters show sharply rising surface brightness levels into the innermost regions .",
    "alcaino ( 1971 , 1979 ) obtained @xmath19 photographic photometry and alcaino et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented multi - color ccd photometry of ngc  6541 .",
    "alcaino ( 1979 ) noted that ngc  6541 has bhb stars and its cmd appears to be similar to that of m13 .",
    "he also noted that ngc  6541 appears to be deficient in bright rgb stars . with deeper ccd photometry , alcaino et al .",

    "they noted a discrepancy in the position of ngc  6541 bhb stars in @xmath21 and @xmath22 diagrams , in the sense that @xmath23 magnitude of bhb stars in ngc  6541 appear to be @xmath5 0.3  0.4 mag brighter than those in m79 . using an isochrone fitting method",
    ", they claimed that ngc  6541 is very old , one of the oldest clusters they had studied .",
    "lee & carney ( 2002 ) presented high - resolution echelle spectroscopy of both clusters .",
    "they noted that both clusters appear to be silicon enhanced and titanium depleted compared to the intermediate halo clusters .",
    "in particular , they suggested that [ si / ti ] ratios appear to be related to galactocentric distances , in the sense that [ si / ti ] ratios decrease with galactocentric distance , and they proposed that these [ si / ti ] gradients with galactocentric distance may be due to the different masses of the sne ii progenitors .",
    "the high [ si / ti ] ratios toward the galactic center may be due to higher - mass sne ii contributions .",
    "this is an additional hint that both clusters may have formed particularly early .",
    "lee & carney ( 2002 ) also derived the radial velocity of the clusters ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "their results suggest that the radial velocities of ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 are small enough that they are most likely genuine inner halo clusters unless their tangential motions are extremely large . unfortunately",
    ", neither cluster has a measured proper motion as yet .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the relative ages of inner halo clusters ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 using hst pc2 photometry .",

    "no problems were reported during the observations .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] lists the journal of observations .",
    "the raw images were calibrated using the hst standard calibration pipeline to perform bias subtraction , dark current subtraction , flat field correction , and shutter shade correction ( wfpc2 group 1998 ) .",
    "the final processed f555w images for ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 are presented in figure  1 and figure  2 , respectively . with the calibrated images",
    ", we masked the vignetted portions of the pc chip , which are not usable for further analysis .",
    "to perform point - spread function ( psf ) photometry for all calibrated images , we used daophotii , allstar and allframe ( stetson 1994 , 1995 ; turner 1995 ) following the procedure described in lee & carney ( 1999a ) and lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . with the psf magnitudes returned from the final allframe run",
    ", we performed the aperture corrections .",
    "holtzman et al .  ( 1995a ) adopted aperture magnitudes with a 0.5 arcsec ( @xmath5 11 pixel in hst pc ) aperture size and the sky annuli of 4 arcsec ( @xmath5 88 pixel ) to 6 arcsec ( @xmath5 132 pixel ) in deriving their transformation relations between the hst f555w",
    "/ f814w photometric system and the standard johnson - cousins @xmath0 photometric system .",
    "johnson et al .  ( 1999 ) claimed that , however , the sky annuli that holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) used are too large for crowded field photometry and they adopted sky annuli of 2.0 arcsec ( @xmath5 44 pixel ) and 2.5 arcsec ( @xmath5 55 pixel ) .",
    "they suggested that this reduces the effects of badly subtracted neighbors in crowded regions and uneven sky brightness across the clusters .",
    "they noted that the magnitude difference between using the larger and the smaller sky annuli is only 0.001 mag and it appears to be much smaller than the errors induced by other effects .",
    "we compare the aperture magnitude differences using the two different sizes of the sky annuli in ngc  6541-f1 , which is the least crowded among our fields , and we obtain 0.002 @xmath11 0.015 mag .",
    "the difference appears to be negligible and therefore we adopt a 0.5 arcsec aperture size and the sky annuli of 2.0 arcsec and 2.5 arcsec during our aperture corrections .",
    "the hst wfpc2 cameras introduce a geometric distortion as a result of their optical design ( holtzman et al .",
    "the geometric distortion causes the effective pixel area to vary across the ccd chip and affects astrometry and the point source photometry .",
    "the pixel area effect is corrected during the flat field correction and consequently , after flattening , all pixels are normalized to the same area .",
    "photometrically , this preserves surface brightness but causes a change in the pixel scale with the biggest effect at the edges of the chip ( see , for example , figure  15 of holtzman et al .",
    "thus , the geometric distortion does not affect surface photometry , but does alter point source photometry .",
    "we corrected the geometric distortion effect in our images using the prescription of wfpc2 group ( 1998 ) .",
    "the hst wfpc2 ccds also have a significant charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) problem which causes some signal to be lost when charge is transferred down the chip during readout .",
    "this has the effect of making objects at higher row numbers appear fainter than they would if they were at low row numbers because more of the charge gets trapped for the objects near the top of the chip .",
    "the effect also depends on the temperature of the chip , the brightness of the sources , in the sense that the cte effect is larger for the faint sources , and the amount of background charge on the chip , such that there is significantly less cte effect due to the enhanced pedestal charge level of the chip when the background is bright .",
    "hence the cte effect on the pc2 chip is expected to be larger than those on the wf2 chips due to the lower background .",
    "we corrected the cte problem in our images using the prescription of whitmore & heyer ( 1997 ) .",
    "finally , the transformation to the standard johnson - cousins @xmath0 photometric system was performed using the relations given by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) . following holtaman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) , the calculations were performed iteratively and @xmath25 magnitudes and @xmath26 colors converged to @xmath11 0.001 mag within 3 iterations .    in figure  3",
    ", we show the differences in @xmath25 magnitudes and @xmath26 colors as functions of @xmath25 magnitudes of the stars in the overlap regions in ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 .",
    "the residuals are in the sense of the field f1 minus the field f2 in each cluster . for our calculations , we used stars with @xmath25 @xmath27 23.0 mag for ngc  6293 and @xmath25 @xmath27 22.5 mag for ngc  6541 and we excluded the stars detected within 10 pixels from the edges of the chip .",
    "as shown in the figure , the magnitudes and colors are in good agreement between the two fields in each cluster with @xmath28 = 0.003 @xmath11 0.006 mag and @xmath29 = 0.001 @xmath11 0.003 mag for ngc  6293 ( 431 stars ) and",

    "( the errors are those of the mean . )",
    "therefore , zero - point offsets were not applied in our results .",
    "in figure  4 , we present cmds of ngc  6293 for the stars in the fields f1 ( 6761 stars ) , f2 ( 3150 stars ) , and the overlap region ( 844 stars ) .",

    "as discussed by lee & carney ( 2002 ) , ngc  6293 has a low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath121.99 ) and its bhb morphology is consistent with its metal - poor nature . since the rgb stars brighter than @xmath25 @xmath5 14.5 mag were saturated even in the short exposure frames during the observations , we are not able to test the janes & heasley ( 1991 ) observation that the rgb tip is a full magnitude fainter than that of m92 .",

    "our cmds may support the idea ( alcaino 1979 ) that ngc  6541 is deficient in luminous rgb stars . since the fov of the hst pc is small and the two fields",

    "however , the bss candidates in ngc  6293 appear to be more centrally concentrated ( i.e.  the frequency of the bss candidates is higher in the field f1 than in the field f2 ) and , therefore , they seem more likely related to the cluster rather than the off - cluster field populations .",
    "are the numbers of blue stragglers enhanced by the dynamical state of a cluster ?",
    "while this is plausible , in that binary star orbits should harden by interactions in dense environments , evidence to support the conjecture is hard to find .",

    "vandenberg , bolte , & stetson ( 1990 ) described a method to derive accurate relative cluster ages with similar chemical compositions .",
    "they recommended shifting the clusters cmds in color until the to colors agreed , then shifting the magnitudes until the upper main - sequence is matched at a point 0.05 mag redder than the to .",
    "the color differences of the resulting brgb could then be used to estimate the relative age of the clusters , since the color difference between the to and the brgb is a monotonic and inverse function of age .",
    "further , this color difference is independent of differences in cluster distances and reddenings , as well as differences in photometric zero - points .",
    "this method is known to be nearly insensitive to metallicity within moderately large ranges in metallicity ( see below ) .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this method is vulnerable to the oxygen abundance .",
    "since oxygen has a higher ionization potential than the other abundant heavy elements ( magnesium , silicon , calcium , iron ) , the difference in the oxygen abundance affects the color and the luminosity of to stars but not those of rgb stars , in the sense that higher oxygen abundance makes a redder and less luminous to .",
    "oxygen also plays a vital role in the hotter part of cno bi - cycle , so the to luminosity is also affected ( vandenberg 1992 ) .",
    "vandenberg & stetson ( 1991 ) studied the effect of the oxygen abundance on the relative age estimations using this method ( see also vandenberg & bell 2001 ) .",
    "their results suggested that changes in the oxygen abundance could mimic age differences , in the sense that the higher oxygen abundance imitates an older age at a given metallicity .",
    "however , vandenberg & stetson ( 1991 ) also pointed out that this effect is less important at the lowest metallicities and at the oldest ages .",

    "however , many of the ngc  6293 hb stars still appear to have fainter magnitudes or redder colors than m92 hb stars , suggesting that the discrepancy may not be mainly due to the _ induced _ differential reddening due to differences in the temperatures of the stars .",
    "_ true _ differential reddening and variations in interstellar absorption may also be at work .",

    "figure  15 clearly indicates that most under - luminous hb stars are located to the north of the cluster ( the upper left corner of the figure ) , suggesting that differential reddening exists in the cluster .",
    "we also explore this differential reddening effect using the ngc  6293 rgb stars .",
    "we select stars with @xmath66 @xmath27 300 and @xmath67 @xmath68 400 detected in the field ngc  6293-f1 ( inside the dotted lines in figure  15 ; this area does not overlap with the field ngc  6293-f2 ) and we show their cmd superposed on the cmd of stars detected in the rest of the field in figure  16 . as can be seen , the colors of rgb stars in this region appears to be @xmath45 @xmath5 0.03  0.05 mag redder than the mean color of the fiducial sequence of the cluster .",
    "therefore , if this color difference is due to the differential reddening , the interstellar extinction toward the north of the cluster is @xmath4 = 0.02  0.04 mag and @xmath28 = 0.06  0.12 mag larger . in figure  17 , we show the cmd of the hb region in the field ngc  6293-f1 after applying the mean differential reddening correction , @xmath45 = 0.04 mag and @xmath28 = 0.08 mag .",
    "it should be recalled that this differential reddening correction value came from the rgb stars and applying this correction value to the ngc  6293 hb stars shows good agreement with the m92 hb fiducial sequence .",

    "vandenberg ( 2000 ) also claimed that m3 appears to be @xmath5 1 - 1.5 gyr younger than m92 .",
    "recently , rey et al .  ( 2001 ) studied m3 vs m13 and they concluded that m13 is 1.7 @xmath11 0.7 gyr older than m3 , while rosenberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested the same ages between the two clusters .",
    "another example is m5 compared to ngc  6752 .",
    "vandenberg ( 2000 ) obtained @xmath5 2 gyr younger ages than did rosenberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for these clusters .",
    "although rosenberg et al .  ( 1999 ) claimed that their results are based on the homogenous data sets , an independent investigation using deep main - sequence photometry of their sample would be desirable .",
    "figure  18 relies mainly on rosenberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . ] and stetson et al .  ( 1999 ) .",
    "the figure shows that the ages of the oldest globular clusters ( mostly the old halo population ) in our galaxy do not vary with metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath27 @xmath121.0 ) or galactocentric distance .",
    "in particular , our work clearly shows that there is no age gradient in the inner part of our galaxy .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with the idea that the globular cluster formation must have been triggered almost everywhere at about the same time in our galaxy .",
    "since harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) claimed that the very remote halo cluster ngc  2419 ( @xmath10 @xmath5 90 kpc ) and m92 essentially have the same age , our result and that of lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) extend this to the three most metal - poor inner halo ( @xmath10 @xmath48 3 kpc ) globular clusters in our galaxy .",
    "we have presented hst pc2 photometry for the inner halo globular clusters ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 .",
    "our cmd for ngc  6293 shows a strong bhb population , consistent with its low metallicity and old age .",
    "it also appears to have blue straggler stars and a future study related to these objects is desirable .",
    "we could not investigate the rgb - tip luminosity , which was claimed by janes & heasley ( 1991 ) to be abnormally faint , since the bright rgb stars were saturated in our images .",
    "our magnitudes and colors for the ngc  6541 main - sequence to are in good agreement with the ground - based @xmath0 photometry of alcaino ( 1997 ) .",
    "our cmd for ngc  6541 appears to be deficient in bright rgb stars , confirming the finding of alcaino ( 1997 ) .",
    "we have discussed the interstellar reddening and the distance modulus of ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 with respect to those of m92 . for ngc  6293 ,",
    "our interstellar reddening estimate is consistent with previous results , while our distance modulus is @xmath5 0.1 mag smaller than the previous estimate by harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "we also discussed the differential reddening across ngc  6293 .",
    "it appears that the interstellar reddening value of ngc  6293 varies by @xmath4 @xmath5 0.02  0.04 mag . for ngc  6541 , our age - dating method , which makes use of m92 as a template , appears to suffer from modest metallicity difference effects .",
    "our interstellar reddening and distance modulus of ngc  6541 are @xmath1 = 0.17 and @xmath2 = 14.24 without the correction for the metallicity effect , and @xmath1 = 0.14 and @xmath2 = 14.19 with such a correction .",
    "nevertheless , ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 are clearly located in the galaxy s central regions ( @xmath3 3 kpc ) .",
    "the most interesting result of our study is that the inner halo clusters ngc  6293 and ngc  6541 essentially have ages that are indistinguishably different from one of the oldest globular clusters in our galaxy m92 , consistent with the previous result of ngc  6287 by lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the large study of de  angeli et al .",
    "furthermore , they appear to have the same ages as the most remote metal - poor globular cluster ngc  2419 ( @xmath78 90 kpc ) .",
    "our results strongly support the idea that the globular cluster formation must have begun everywhere at the same time to within @xmath5 0.5  1 gyr in our galaxy .",
