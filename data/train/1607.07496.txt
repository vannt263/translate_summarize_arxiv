    "an initially well - localized wave packet comprising many energy eigenstates of a system follows classical trajectory in its short time evolution and displays reconstruction after a classical period .",
    "afterwards it spreads during its long time evolution , only to reverse the spreading and reshape after a certain time called the revival time .",
    "originally observed in highly excited electrons in atoms @xcite , the phenomenon has been studied in a large variety of scenarios , such as , gaussian wps in exactly solvable models systems @xcite , temporal evolution of coherent states @xcite , periodically driven systems @xcite , wp dynamics even at an attosecond time scale @xcite , revivals in coherent photon fields @xcite or photon lattices @xcite , or recently , the propagation of wps in graphene under magnetic fields @xcite and the use of wps to detect extremely long coherence times @xcite .",
    "quantum revivals have also been widely studied over the years in a more mathematical context , with emphasis on obtaining accurate analytical expressions @xcite .",
    "the multiple interferences of the wp components lead also to the so - called fractional revivals at divisors of the revival time , which have been predicted @xcite and observed in rydberg wps @xcite or photon bouncing balls @xcite .",
    "fractional revivals can retrieve information about the system even if it decays before the first revival @xcite .",
    "they can be used for mapping the quantum phase of a molecular nuclear wp in two - dimensional spectroscopy @xcite , or even to factorize prime numbers @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that information entropy in position and momentum spaces can reveal the existence of fractional revivals @xcite .    in this article the dynamical recurrences@xmath0 quantum revivals and fractional revivals@xmath0 of a gaussian wave are explored by means of temporal evolution of probability density both in position and momentum spaces .",
    "the space - time and momentum - time evolution of the wave packet lead to the formation of highly structured patterns known as quantum carpets .",
    "the quantum carpets woven by position space wave packets have been discussed to explain the maximum and minimum probability density profiles @xcite and have been used to observe decoherence effects @xcite and talbot effect with matter waves @xcite .",
    "however , quantum carpets woven by momentum space wave packets have only been discussed in few contexts @xcite . here",
    "we show that the designs of quantum carpets reflect self - similar structures after regular intervals of space - time and momentum - time which leads us to identify dynamical fractional revivals . for our analysis",
