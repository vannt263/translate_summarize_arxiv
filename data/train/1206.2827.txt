    "now , since the bath temperatures are unequal , the system is driven out of equilibrium . however , it may still be possible to define a temperature like thermodynamic variable _ locally _ in a region if the average energy of the sites @xmath99 belonging to that region is not too different from each other .",
    "the system is said to have local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) if all the correlation functions measured in this local region are identical to those of a thermodynamically large equilibrium system with an average energy @xmath99 .",
    "numerically , one measures the correlation functions @xmath100 locally over @xmath101 consecutive sites about @xmath102 such that the average energy of these @xmath103 sites is almost equal to each other . for a system of size",

    "an excellent match with the equilibrium functions assures that the driven spin system attains thermal equilibrium locally .",
    "thus , following the equilibrium definition , we may define _ uniquely _ the local inverse temperature    @xmath109      in the previous section we have seen that the driven system attains local thermal equilibrium , and thus a local temperature can be uniquely defined through eq .",
    "( [ betax ] ) .",
    "therefore , the usual definition of fourier law @xmath110 can also be equivalently expressed as @xmath111 the thermal current and the energy profile are measured as described in the following . since the dtoe dynamics alternately updates only half of the spins ( but all the bond energies simultaneously ) , the energy of the bonds @xmath112 measured immediately after the update of odd spins is different from @xmath113 measured after the update of even spins . clearly , this difference @xmath114 is a measure of the energy flowing through the @xmath23-th bond in each mcs .",
    "thus the thermal current in the steady state is given by @xmath115 and the average energy of @xmath23-th bond is @xmath116 .",
    "in fact , this expression for the current , in the limit @xmath117 , is consistent with that obtained from the continuity equation @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the local energy density .",
    "straightforward calculation using the continuity equation gives the instantaneous current across @xmath23-th bond @xmath120    again , when the @xmath23-th site ( say , even ) gets updated , the energy of the @xmath23-th bond is @xmath121 and after the subsequent update of odd sites it becomes @xmath122 .",
    "thus using eq .",
    "( [ precess ] ) , the instantaneous current ( time is measured in units of @xmath0 ) across the @xmath23-th bond in the limit @xmath123 reduces to @xmath124 which is same as eq .",
    "( [ conteq ] ) .    in the following ,",
    "we show that the model with dtoe dynamics can be solved exactly in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 limits to obtain analytical expressions for the energy current and energy profile .",
    "we show that energy transport in any finite system is ballistic in the limit @xmath9 , whereas diffusive transport is observed for @xmath125 0.5 cm",
    "_ ballistic limit _ ( @xmath126 ) : in this limit , the spins are nearly aligned ( hence @xmath127 ) and , therefore , precess by small angles . in dtoe dynamics",

    "this equivalence can be utilised to write the energy function eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) in this limit as @xmath128 which is similar to the energy function of a harmonic system .",
    "since the dtoe dynamics is energy conserving , update of a spin @xmath19 assures that @xmath129 remains invariant .",
    "again , since the low temperature stationary state dynamics is governed by spin waves i.e. , spin configuration whose orientation varies slowly with distance along the axis of the chain , the spins are locally parallel and @xmath130 is invariant in the @xmath117 limit .",
    "thus the only allowed dynamics for the angle variable is @xmath131 consequently , the energy of the bonds that connect to the @xmath23-th spin , namely @xmath132 and @xmath133 , are mutually exchanged in this limit . starting from @xmath134 , the bond energies @xmath135 for the odd bonds ` move ' to the right and the even bond energies @xmath136 ` move ' to the left ballistically ( without any scattering ) .    in the steady state , the average bond energies after the update of odd spins are @xmath137 and @xmath138 whereas , the same after the update of even spins become @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "thus the effective correlation length diverges as @xmath117 and energy in any finite system would be transferred to arbitrary distances without being scattered .    also , unlike the equilibrium case , the correlation functions of the driven system _ depend _ on @xmath0 when @xmath12 is finite . in the following ,",
    "we argue that when @xmath146 the correlation length @xmath147 actually diverges . since the energy profile in this limit is flat , a small change @xmath148 will not change the correlation functions substantially . in order to keep the correlation functions ( which are functions @xmath149 ) unaltered",

    "while conventional integration schemes fail to preserve the required conservation of @xmath24 and @xmath28 , this dynamics preserves both .",

    "the system size @xmath12 ) ; the equation of motion is recovered from the map in the limit @xmath117 .",

    "the energy profile in this case is linear with the slope asymptotically approaching the value @xmath222 however , for small system sizes ( i.e. for @xmath210 ) , thermal transport appears to be ballistic with a relatively flatter energy profile .",
    "the same scenario prevails when , instead , the temperature @xmath50 is varied .",
    "that is , for a given @xmath12 and @xmath0 , the slope of the energy profile approaches @xmath223 ( or @xmath224 ) as @xmath163 ( or @xmath224 ) .",
    "thus , finite systems show an apparent crossover from a diffusive to a ballistic behavior as @xmath50 is lowered below a characteristic temperature scale @xmath225 .",
    "this is described in fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] along with additional numerical evidences .    to demonstrate the crossover phenomena quantitatively , we measure the local slope @xmath226 of the energy profile at @xmath227 for a system of size @xmath12 and",

    "[ fig : m ] we show the crossover temperature @xmath230 for two different system sizes , @xmath231 . the crossover line @xmath232 separates the diffusive regime ( well above the curve ) from the ballistic one ( well below the curve ) .",
    "again , the crossover line shifts downwards when the system size @xmath12 is increased .",
    "this clearly indicates that in the thermodynamic limit , the crossover line is infinitesimally close to the axes and thus , for any @xmath162 , one observes a diffusive behaviour independent of the choice of @xmath160 the apparent ballistic behaviour in the small @xmath0 or small @xmath50 regime is only an artifact of finiteness of the system and is a consequence of the divergence of the correlation length , as @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath147 on @xmath0 can be understood from the fact that the spin precesses by a small angle , proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "this effect is similar to a low temperature precession - dynamics , where the correlation length @xmath147 is very large .",
    "thus , for studying thermal transport at a given @xmath50 and a small @xmath0 , one must carefully choose the system size to be large enough such that the point ( @xmath235 ) lies well above the crossover line .",
    "the model is exactly solvable in both the limits @xmath126 and @xmath163 . in the @xmath126 limit ,",
    "the thermal current @xmath236 is independent of @xmath12 and the energy profile @xmath237 is flat . in this limit fourier law",
    "is violated as @xmath2 is not proportional to local slope of @xmath204 , which is now zero since @xmath204 is flat .",
    "the finite current @xmath238 is a consequence of the _ discontinuity _ of the energy profile at the boundaries .",
    "this discontinuity , and therefore a finite current , can never be obtained numerically for any finite @xmath0 , however small .",
    "numerical simulations , in fact , show that the current vanishes as @xmath239 for small @xmath160      in conclusion , a thermodynamically large classical heisenberg spin chain in one dimension obeys fourier law for any non - zero temperature .",
    "however while studying thermal transport numerically for a finite system ( though large ) and a finite integration time step ( though small ) one must be careful in keeping the boundary temperatures larger than the characteristic scale @xmath242 to obtain the correct thermodynamic behaviour .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath243 the system will show an apparent ballistic behaviour which will eventually disappear in the @xmath244 limit .",
    "this temperature dependent crossover from diffusive to ballistic behavior at small @xmath50 is expected since @xmath185 is a critical point with a diverging correlation length .",
    "it will be quite interesting to study thermal transport in a system where one can set the boundary temperatures such that a singular point falls in the bulk .",
