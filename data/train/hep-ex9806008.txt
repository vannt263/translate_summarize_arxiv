    "the hermes experiment ( a asurement of pin ) is a second generation polarised deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiment to study the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "it is being run at the hera storage ring at desy .",
    "several experiments over the last decade have provided accurate data on the polarisation asymmetry of the cross - section for _ inclusive _ scattering where only the scattered lepton is detected .",
    "these experiments have been interpreted as showing that at most 30% of the nucleon spin comes from the spins of the quarks .",
    "further knowledge of the origin of the nucleon s spin can be gained by studying _",
    "semi - inclusive _ processes involving the detection of hadrons in coincidence with the scattered lepton .",
    "these data offer a means of ` flavour - tagging ' the struck quark to help isolate the contributions to the nucleon spin of the individual quark flavours , including the sea quarks .",
    "the interpretation of semi - inclusive data is made clearer if the type of hadron is identified .",
    "this is a central theme of the hermes experiment , which can identify pions and will add kaon identification for 1998 .    the physics program for hermes is very broad .",
    "the experiment contributes inclusive data with qualitatively different systematic uncertainties to improve the world data set for the _ x _ dependence and the integral of the spin structure function g@xmath45(@xmath46 ) for both the proton and the neutron ( see below for the definition of @xmath46 ) .",
    "most importantly , hermes is providing new precise data on semi - inclusive processes by virtue of the good acceptance of the spectrometer combined with hadron identification and the purity of the targets .",
    "the hera storage ring can be filled with either electrons or positrons , which are accelerated to 27.5  gev .",
    "positrons have been used since 1995 because longer beam lifetimes are then possible . since with few exceptions such as the luminosity measurement ,",
    "the physics processes are the same for positrons and electrons , the term `` positron '' will be used for both in this paper .",
    "in addition to studying polarised dis using @xmath47 targets , data are collected with unpolarised gases ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this provides in a relatively short period of time ( 2 - 3 weeks ) high statistics data sets that are used to study important properties of the nucleon not related to spin , such as the flavour asymmetry of the sea , as well as hadronisation in nuclei .",
    "the hermes experiment is located in the east hall of the hera storage ring complex at desy .",
    "the spectrometer is a forward angle instrument of conventional design .",
    "it is symmetric about a central , horizontal shielding plate in the magnet . due to this symmetry",
    ", the description of the detectors contained in this paper will apply typically to only one half of the spectrometer , in particular with respect to the number of detectors quoted and their dimensions .",
    "a diagram of the spectrometer is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spect ] .",
    "the coordinate system used by hermes has the z axis along the beam momentum , the y axis vertical upwards , and the x axis horizontal , pointing towards the outside of the ring .",
    "the polar ( @xmath49 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath50 ) scattering angles as well as the initial trajectory for the determination of the particle s momentum are measured by the front tracking system , which consists of microstrip gas chambers ( msgc , referred to as the vertex chambers ( vc ) ) and drift chambers ( dvc , fc1/2 ) .",
    "the momentum measurement is completed by two sets of drift chambers behind the magnet ( bc1/2 and bc3/4 ) . in addition , there are three proportional chambers in the magnet ( mc1/3 ) to help match front and back tracks as well as to track low momentum particles that do not reach the rear section of the spectrometer .",
    "0.01 cm    particle identification ( pid ) is provided by a lead - glass calorimeter , a pre - shower detector ( h2 ) consisting of two radiation lengths of lead followed by a plastic scintillator hodoscope , a transition radiation detector ( trd ) consisting of six identical modules , and a threshold erenkov detector (  ) .",
    "the particle identification system was designed to provide a hadron rejection factor of 10@xmath10 to yield a very clean dis positron sample , and exceeds this in practice .",
    "pion identification is provided by a threshold erenkov detector .",
    "an upgrade to a ring imaging erenkov detector that will identify both pions and kaons is being prepared for operation in 1998 .",
    "the calorimeter and pre - shower detector are included in the trigger along with a second hodoscope ( h1 ) placed in front of the trd .",
    "an additional trigger hodoscope ( h0 ) was included in 1996 in front of fc1 to reduce the trigger rate from background caused by the proton beam .",
    "the acceptance is limited at small angles by an iron plate in the beam plane , which shields the positron and proton beams from the magnetic field of the spectrometer magnet .",
    "both beams go through the spectrometer , separated by 72  cm .",
    "particles with scattering angles within @xmath51170  mrad in the horizontal direction and between + ( )40  mrad and + ( )140  mrad in the vertical direction are accepted .",
    "therefore , the range of scattering angles is 40  mrad to 220  mrad .",
    "spin structure functions depend on @xmath46 ( @xmath46=  q@xmath31/2m@xmath52 where q is the four - momentum transfer in the dis reaction , @xmath52 is the energy transfer , and m is the mass of the nucleon ) .",
    "the variable @xmath46 can be interpreted as the fraction of the nucleon s momentum carried by the struck quark .",
    "the @xmath46 range covered by the hermes experiment is 0.02 - 1.0 , although there is little count rate for x@xmath530.8 when w @xmath54 2 gev ( w is the photon - nucleon invariant mass ) .    the experiment is mounted on a large platform that can move on rails together with an attached trailer ( et ) containing the electronics and the gas systems . a fixed but removable concrete wall between the platform and the et shields the main part of the hall from radiation and hence allows access to the electronics while the accelerators are running .",
    "cables and gas pipes between the detectors and the et are routed beneath the platform to a large cable tray passing under the shielding wall .",
    "the experiment was assembled in the east hall outside the shielding during the 1994 hera run .",
    "after the shielding wall had been dismantled , the platform / trailer was moved into place in the ring .",
    "the shielding wall was re - erected between the platform and the electronics trailer in such a way that the experiment could be moved far enough within the shielding to allow the hera maintenance tram access to the tunnel on 24 hours notice .",
    "the hermes target consists of gas from a polarised source fed into a storage cell internal to the hera positron ring . in 1995 ,",
    "an optically pumped polarised @xmath55 cell was used to supply gas to the storage cell @xcite , while an atomic beam source ( abs ) was used in 1996 - 97 to produce a @xmath56 target @xcite .",
    "the abs will be modified for operation with @xmath57 in 1998 - 99 .",
    "it is also possible to inject unpolarised gases into the storage cell .",
    "the following were used in the first three years of operation : @xmath48 .",
    "the target region is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : target ] .",
    "the gas enters an open - ended ( ie .",
    "windowless ) t - shaped tube that confines the gas atoms in a region around the positron beam .",
    "the storage cell increases the areal target density by about two orders of magnitude compared to a free atomic beam .",
    "the gas atoms leak out the open ends of the target cell and are pumped away by a high speed differential pumping system . in this way , the number of atoms seen at the target location by the beam is maximized while minimizing the effect on the stored beam .",
    "the storage cell is an elliptical tube , 9.8  mm high by 29.0  mm wide and 400  mm in length .",
    "it was made of 125  @xmath58 m thick ultra - pure aluminium in 1995 and 75  @xmath58 m aluminium in 1996 - 97 .",
    "the transition from the cell to the beam pipe was made smooth to avoid the generation of wake fields that could cause heating and increase the emittance of the beam .",
    "this was accomplished using thin perforated tubes called `` wake field suppressors '' .",
    "the amount of synchrotron radiation created upstream of the hermes area is considerable , even though it is reduced by the addition of two weak dipoles downstream of the last bending magnet in the arc of the accelerator . if it were allowed to hit the target cell , it would damage the cell coating , and on the order of 10@xmath6  -  10@xmath22 soft synchrotron photons per second would compton scatter into the spectrometer acceptance .",
    "this is prevented by a system of two collimators installed near the target .",
    "c1 is placed 2  m upstream of the target and protects the next collimator from direct radiation .",
    "it actually consists of two moveable collimators , c1h in the horizontal direction and c1v in the vertical , separated by 0.5  m. these collimators are opened during beam injection and operated at a narrow but safe setting ( 15@xmath59 + 0.5  mm ) during hermes operation . during the first three years of operation , typical beam parameters were @xmath60=  0.31  mm and @xmath61=  0.07  mm .",
    "c2 has a fixed aperture that is slightly larger than c1 , and is located right in front of the storage cell to protect it from photons scattered in c1 .",
    "it also protects the cell from direct radiation during beam injection .",
    "note that only c2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : target ] .    particles scattered into the spectrometer acceptance exit the target chamber through a thin ( 0.3  mm ) stainless steel foil .",
    "background from showers ( initiated mostly by @xmath62 s from @xmath63 decay ) is reduced by also making the beam pipe just downstream of the target chamber of thin stainless steel .",
    "the hermes spectrometer magnet is of the h - type with field clamps in front as well as behind in order to reduce the fringe fields at the position of the drift chambers fc2 and bc1 .",
    "a massive iron plate in the symmetry plane shields the positron and proton beams as they pass through the magnet .",
    "the most important features of the magnet are :    * it is capable of providing a deflecting power of @xmath64 = 1.5  t@xmath65 m , although it is operated at 1.3  t@xmath65 m to reduce power consumption . the smaller field integral does not significantly impair the performance of the spectrometer .",
    "the variation of the deflecting power within the acceptance is less than 10 % . *",
    "the gap between the pole faces encloses the geometrical acceptance of @xmath51(40 .. 140 )  mrad in the vertical direction . in the horizontal direction @xmath51170 mrad plus",
    "another @xmath51100  mrad starting halfway through the magnet is provided .",
    "the pole faces are tilted parallel to the limits of the vertical angular acceptance . due to the limited space of 8.5  m for the hermes spectrometer between the center of the target and the first quadrupole magnet of the electron machine",
    ", only 2.2  m between the drift chambers fc2 on the front and bc1 on the rear side are utilized for the magnet .",
    "* the fringe field at the positions of the adjacent drift chambers does not exceed 0.1  t. * an effective magnetic shielding substantially reduces the effect of the magnet on the proton and positron beams .",
    "in particular , the sextupole moment of the magnetic field in the beam tubes is minimized . * a correction coil with a deflecting power of 0.08  t@xmath65 m is accommodated inside the shielding of the positron beam pipe .",
    "this coil is used to correct for fringe fields and the imperfections of the magnetic shielding in this section of the iron plate .",
    "it is also intended to compensate the transverse holding field of the target when operating with transverse polarisation .",
    "it serves as an element of a closed orbit bump with no net global effect on the positron beam .",
    "magnetic model calculations were done with the 3d - codes mafia @xcite and tosca @xcite .",
    "the calculations agree with subsequent magnetic measurements within a few percent .",
    "the field measurements were done with a 3d - hall probe on an automated 3d - mapping machine .",
    "the results exhibit an overall reproducibility of about 10@xmath66 , and a field pattern as expected .",
    "no homogeneous regions are found due to the high gap to length ratio of the magnet , and a pronounced step in the field is observed that reflects the structure of the iron shielding plate .",
    "the detailed field map was integrated into the track reconstruction algorithm , as described later .",
    "the tracking system serves several functions , which vary somewhat in their performance requirements :    * determine the event vertex in the target cell to ensure that reconstructed events come only from the sub - mm beam envelope in the target gas , with the expected z - distribution .",
    "also , the analysis of events with multiple tracks requires either a common vertex , or possibly an additional displaced vertex for a reconstructed particle decay .",
    "* measure the scattering angles for kinematic reconstruction .",
    "* measure the particle momentum from the track deflection in the spectrometer dipole magnet . *",
    "identify the hits in the pid detectors associated with each track .    when all tracking detectors are fully operational , the momentum resolution for positrons is limited by bremsstrahlung in the material of the target cell walls , the 0.3  mm thick stainless steel vacuum window , as well as the first tracking detectors .",
    "even the resolution in scattering angle is normally limited by multiple scattering in this material .",
    "an exception was 1995 , the first year of operation , when the low efficiency of most planes of the vertex chambers ( improved for 1996 for the top detector ) made it more attractive to reconstruct the tracks using only the drift chambers ( dc ) , as will be explained later in more detail .",
    "this mode of operation resulted in the resolution of reconstructed kinematic quantities being much more sensitive to the dc spatial resolution .",
    "the locations of the tracking detectors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] and listed in table [ trtab ] , which also summarizes their properties .",
    "the microstrip gas counters vc1/2 , the drift vertex chambers dvc s , and the front drift chambers fc1/2 provide both vertex reconstruction to the target , and definition of the scattering angle . in conjunction with the front tracking , the back drift chambers bc1/2 and bc3/4 measure the magnetic deflection and hence the momentum .",
    "the bc s also identify the cells in the pid detectors associated with each track .",
    "the proportional chambers inside the magnet ( mc1/3 ) were originally intended to ensure that multi - track ambiguities could be resolved .",
    "as it happens , chamber occupancies are low enough that this can be accomplished using the drift chambers alone .",
    "however , the mc s are found to be very useful for momentum analysis of low energy decay products that are deflected too much to reach the downstream tracking detectors .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     due to the high radiation background in the region",
    "very near to the beam , the calorimeter consists of erenkov crystals of nabi(wo@xmath67)@xmath68 @xcite , which have a very high radiation hardness on the order of @xmath69 gy . to further minimize radiation damage ,",
    "the calorimeters are moved away from the beam pipe exit window by @xmath70 20 cm in the horizontal direction for beam injection and dumping .",
    "the properties of nabi(wo@xmath67)@xmath68 are summarized in table  [ lumit1 ] .",
    "the small radiation length and the small molire radius allow a very compact calorimeter design .",

    "this provides a statistical accuracy of the luminosity measurement of 1% , within about 100  s. +",
    "the function of the trigger system is to distinguish interesting events from background with high efficiency , and initiate digitization and readout of the detector signals .",
    "hermes requires physics triggers corresponding to deep - inelastic positron scattering , photoproduction processes ( where no positron is detected ) and additional triggers for detector monitoring and calibration .",
    "the trigger hierarchy is potentially capable of four levels .",
    "however , for running in 1995 - 97 only the first - level trigger was required .",
    "the first - level trigger decision is made within about 400  ns of the event using prompt signals of the scintillator hodoscopes , the calorimeter , and a few wire chambers .",
    "this can be divided into the time necessary for signal formation in the detectors and transportation to the electronics trailer ( @xmath76  250  ns including the transit time of the particle from the target ) , and the time needed for a decision by the trigger electronics ( @xmath76  150  ns ) .",
    "the first - level trigger initiates digitization by the readout electronics .",
    "the second - level trigger could use any information available within the 50  @xmath58s during which time a hardware clear of the fastbus readout electronics is possible .",
    "the third - level decision could be made on a timescale of a few hundred micro - seconds by existing digital signal processors in fastbus , which would first read out only that part of the detector information required for the decision . in fourth level",

    "only the first - level trigger is described below .",
    "the dis trigger selects positron events by requiring hits in the three scintillator hodoscopes , h0 , h1 , and h2 , ( only h1 and h2 in 1995 ) together with sufficient energy deposited in two adjacent columns of the calorimeter , in coincidence with the accelerator bunch signal ( hera clock ) .",
    "the forward h0 scintillator was installed in 1996 because backward - going particles from the hera proton beam are not adequately suppressed by the h1 ",
    "h2 timing alone .",
    "with h0 included , the primary sources of background are hadrons either produced from positron beam interactions in the upstream collimators , or photoproduced in the target .",
    "the requirement of hits in the h0 and h1 hodoscopes suppresses neutral particle background .",
    "the primary charged background discrimination is done using a calorimeter threshold set above the minimum ionizing energy deposition of 0.8  gev .",
    "the calorimeter has high efficiency for electromagnetic showers , but relatively low efficiency for hadronic showers .",
    "the hodoscope thresholds were set below minimum ionizing .",
    "a calorimeter threshold setting of 3.5  gev ( used for the 1995 running and corresponding to @xmath78 ) suppresses the charged hadronic background rate by a factor of @xmath53 10 in the trigger .",
    "the typical trigger rate at a luminosity of @xmath79  nucleons / cm@xmath31/sec , was about 50  hz in 1995 .",
    "the threshold was lowered to 1.4  gev during 1996 to increase the @xmath80 range to @xmath81 and improve the acceptance for semi - inclusive particles .",
    "the photoproduction trigger detects hadrons such as k , @xmath82 , d@xmath83 , j/@xmath84 and @xmath85 that are produced at low @xmath86 and decay to two or more charged particles .",
    "typically the scattered positron angle is too small for detection .",
    "the trigger requires charged particle tracks in both the top and bottom detectors , as identified by the three hodoscopes and the bc1 chamber as well as the hera clock .",
    "the back chamber requirement eliminates those showers originating in the upstream collimators , which are confined near the beampipe and hit the tips of the hodoscopes but not the wire chambers which are well shielded by the magnet steel .",
    "the signals needed for the first - level triggers are the hodoscopes ( h0 , h1 , h2 ) , a multiplicity of two or more hits in the back wire chambers ( bc1 ) , and a cluster of calorimeter blocks with total energy above threshold .",
    "hits in the top and bottom halves of the spectrometer are required for the photoproduction trigger .",
    "each hodoscope photomultiplier ( pmt ) signal is passively split with one output going to a lecroy 1881 m analog to digital convertor ( adc ) and the other going to a lecroy 3420 constant fraction disciminator ( cfd ) .",

    "the data are copied between fills to storage silos on the desy main site via a fddi link and associated hardware . in parallel , they are stored on local exabyte tape drives for redundancy .",
    "the local system was switched to dlt tapes late in 1996 .",
    "a total of 2  tb was recorded in 1995 and 4.1  tb in 1996 .",
    "the deadtime during standard running is typically well below 10% and the downtime due to the data aquisition system is estimated to be below 1% .",
    "the possible throughput of was determined by the cpu and",
    "i / o bandwidth of the event distributing work station ( alpha 3000x ) , which corresponds to a 150 hz event rate at the average event size . by replacing the 175 mhz 3000x with a 266 mhz 5/266 , this was doubled for 1997 .",
    "since hermes is a fixed target experiment , the scattered particles are mostly forward and the detectors are necessarily in close proximity to the beamline .",
    "this makes the experiment sensitive to beam induced background .",
    "the two main sources of background associated with the positron beam are synchrotron radiation and showers from halo particles striking the collimators just upstream of the target .",
    "several closed orbit corrections ( i.e. that affect the beam only locally ) are available to help minimize background .",
    "these are of two types : symmetric which affect the position of the beam at the interaction point ( ip ) , and asymmetric which vary the angle at the ip .",
    "it was determined to be crucial to tune the beam in the straight section upstream of the experiment to minimize synchrotron radiation .",
    "in particular , background from this source is acceptable only when a special asymmetric orbit correction well upstream of the ip is optimized .",
    "the detectors most susceptable to backgrounds are the front tracking chambers and the trd , the former because they must operate in front of the magnet and hence in the presence of a large flux of low energy particles , the latter because it is particularly sensitive to photons by design .",
    "the trd was made less vulnerable to synchrotron radiation by adding a thin sheet of lead ( @xmath871  mm ) in front of the first chamber to absorb some of the low energy incident photon flux .    to help optimize background conditions",
    "before the detectors are turned on , dedicated scintillators were installed around the beam pipe .",
    "this system is called the tuning scintillation telescope ( tst ) .",
    "the tst consists of 2 sets of scintillators ( 8 each ) that are located upstream of the front chambers at z  = + 1.4  m and behind the luminosity detector at z  = + 8.3  m. each set has two layers of 4 scintillators surrounding the beampipe to view the beam halo .",
    "the first layer is unshielded and therefore is sensitive to synchrotron radiation as well as charged particles .",
    "the second layer is shielded with 3 mm of lead , so the synchrotron radiation is mostly suppressed .",
    "charged particle halo and synchrotron radiation can be identified using coincidences and anticoincidences between the first and second layers of scintillators .",
    "beam tuning is then a matter of minimizing the counting rates and making them symmetric .",
    "the tst is used primarily during initial beam tuning when the accelerators are first turned on at the start of a running period , and at the beginning of a fill of the storage rings .",
    "beam position monitors ( bpm ) on either side of the ip allow the beam to be adjusted to a pre - determined position and angle in a short time .",
    "the bpms are particularly useful at the beginning of a fill of the storage rings .",
    "the experiment is also exposed to particles that come from showers originating from the proton beam .",
    "a set of scintillators was installed around the proton beam pipe just behind the calorimeter to monitor this background .",
    "background from this source varies significantly from fill to fill and even during a fill .",
    "however , essentially none of it is correlated with the events of interest so its main effect is to increase the trigger rate and decrease the proportion of good events going to tape . as outlined previously ,",
    "the addition of the front trigger hodoscope ( h0 ) has significantly improved the situation .",
    "this paper describes the spectrometer built to measure the products of deep inelastic scattering of polarised positrons from polarised internal gas targets at hera . after a relatively short commissioning phase ,",
    "the experiment started recording data in 1995 .",
    "all essential detectors have performed well with only a few component failures over the first two and a half years of running .",
    "the acceptance of the spectrometer allows the detection of hadrons in coincidence with the scattered positron .",
    "these important semi - inclusive measurements with the identification of pions and kaons are unique to hermes and will allow the determination of the spin dependent quark distribution functions .",
    "the hermes collaboration would like to thank all those who participated in the design and construction of the spectrometer .",
    "we are particularly indebted to the mea staff at desy , many more of whom contributed than are mentioned in the author list .",
