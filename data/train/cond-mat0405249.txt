    "a jumping process can be defined in terms of two probability distributions which determine a jump size and a waiting time between consecutive jumps .",
    "one usually assumes that both distributions are independent of each other .",
    "such process is often regarded as a generalized form of the random walk and used to describe a diffusive transport .",
    "that approach , known as the continuous - time random walk theory @xcite , is able to account for various forms of diffusion , both normal and anomalous , by a suitable choice of the probability distributions defining the process @xcite .",
    "power - law dependences are especially interesting @xcite .",
    "a stochastic trajectory characterized by jump sizes so distributed , exhibits a pattern typical for the lvy flights and features systems which reveal the enhanced diffusion @xcite . on the other hand , long tails of the waiting time distribution ( long rests )",
    "evoke the opposite effect : they are responsible for the subdiffusion @xcite .",
    "processes which possess such tails are often treated in terms of the fractional diffusion equation @xcite .    for uniform distribution of jumps in time ,",
    "i.e. if the waiting time probability density has the exponential form , the jumping process relaxes to some stationary equilibrium .",
    "the kangaroo process @xcite provides a simple and well - known example . instead of the jump size distribution",
    ", this process assumes a probability distribution of the process value after the jump and , in addition , a jumping rate which depends on the process value .",
    "an advantage of the kangaroo process from the point of view of possible applications stems from the fact that it can be easily constructed for arbitrary correlations .",
    "a need for models of correlated noises is obvious .",
    "for example , the long correlations , both in space and time , arise as a result of the fast modes removal procedure @xcite .",
    "long tails of the correlation function emerge also in the relaxation process of a system coupled to a fractal heat bath via a random matrix interaction @xcite . in those cases",
    "the stochastic dynamics obeys the generalized , non - markovian , langevin equation and the monte carlo simulation of solutions requires a specific model of the noise .",
    "unfortunately , the kangaroo process is not suitable to model noises with power law correlations : the distribution of the stochastic variable during the trajectory evolution is biased because the waiting time distribution changes its shape when it is inserted into the generalized langevin equation @xcite . as a result",
    ", the relaxation to the thermal equilibrium can not be achieved .    in this paper",
    "we consider a simple power - law correlated jumping process which is exempt of that difficulty .",
    "our objective is not only to analyze the master equation for that process but above all to obtain the stochastic variable itself by solving a stochastic equation .",
    "therefore the presented procedure can be utilized as a noise model for numerical simulations of the stochastic trajectories in the framework of the langevin formalism .",
    "we define the process and discuss corresponding equations in sec.ii .",
    "the expression for the autocorrelation function is derived in sec.iii , whereas sec.iv is devoted to the application of the process as a model of some specific form of the correlated noise in the generalized langevin equation .",
    "the main results are summarized in sec.iv .",
    "we assume that a stochastic process is step - wise , i.e. a process value @xmath2 is constant within the time intervals @xmath3 : @xmath4 for @xmath5 . jumping times @xmath6",
    "are randomly distributed and jumping rate @xmath7 depends on the process value .",
    "the size of the jump , defined as the difference between the values of @xmath2 after and before the jump , is determined from a given probability distribution @xmath8 .",
    "then the stochastic trajectory @xmath9 obeys the following equation @xmath10 where the waiting time @xmath11 is governed by the poissonian distribution : @xmath12 which determines the probability density that a jump occurs in the interval @xmath13 .",
    "the initial condition for the eq.([stoch ] ) , @xmath14 , follows from a given probability distribution @xmath15 .",
    "the eq.([stoch ] ) is stochastic because it determines the time evolution of the stochastic variable @xmath2 , in contrast to the master equation which can give us only probability distributions .",
    "the trajectory @xmath9 can be constructed step by step by sampling consecutive values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 from the distributions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the process is markovian and stationary .",
    "the transition probability @xmath20 that the process value is between @xmath2 and @xmath21 at an infinitesimal time @xmath22 , providing it was equal @xmath23 at @xmath24 , is given by : @xmath25 in the above expression we have utilized the fact that @xmath26 may depend only on time differences . the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([trkp ] ) is the probability that no jump occurred in the time interval @xmath27 .",
    "the term @xmath28 means the probability that one jump occurred .",
    "the master equation for a probability density @xmath29 can be obtained by calculating the time derivative from @xmath29 and taking into account all possible initial values @xmath23 : @xmath30/\\delta t. \\end{split}\\ ] ] we get the master equation in the following form @xmath31    the jumping process described above is still too general and thus we introduce additional restrictions .",
    "let @xmath2 be a two - dimensional vector , @xmath32 , with the unit length : @xmath33 .",
    "therefore we require the norm to be preserved during the jumps . with these assumptions ,",
    "the process can be described in terms of a single angle variable @xmath34 : @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for the probability density @xmath19",
    "we take the gaussian : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a given width and the normalization constant @xmath39 $ ] contains the modified bessel function .",
    "we will demonstrate in the following that the jumping rate @xmath40 determines the shape of the process autocorrelation function .",
    "it appears algebraic if @xmath40 is given by the expression @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "taking into account the above assumptions , we obtain the master equation eq.([fpkp ] ) in the one - dimensional form : @xmath43 the equilibrium solution of eq.([mast ] ) , @xmath44 , has to satisfy the condition @xmath45const .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 becomes quite simple : @xmath46 since for the jumping rate ( [ nu ] ) @xmath47 , @xmath44 is properly normalized .",
    "numerical simulation of stochastic trajectories requires random numbers distributed like @xmath8 , according to eq.([ker ] ) .",
    "for that purpose we apply the rejection method which allows us to avoid evaluating complicated integrals .",
    "the algorithm is the following .",
    "first we sample uniformly distributed random numbers @xmath48 from the interval @xmath49 . then @xmath50 is calculated and this value is compared with another random number , @xmath51 , uniformly distributed within the interval @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the minimum and maximum values of @xmath19 , respectively . if @xmath55 then @xmath56 is accepted , otherwise it is rejected and the sampling procedure is repeated",
    "the autocorrelation function of the process ( acf ) , @xmath57 , where the average is taken over the stationary distribution @xmath58 , can be evaluated from the following expression @xcite @xmath59 the conditional probability of passing from @xmath23 to @xmath2 during the time @xmath60 , @xmath61 , can be obtained by taking into account all possible paths leading from @xmath23 to @xmath2 and summing over the jumps @xcite . the final formula for the laplace transform of acf can be expressed by the following series    @xmath62d\\phi_0d\\phi . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    inverting the laplace transform we obtain the final expression for acf : @xmath63    we are interested in the asymptotic bahaviour of @xmath64 for large @xmath60 . in this limit the first term of eq.([covt ] )",
    "can be estimated easily . because of the exponential dependence of the integrand on @xmath60 , only a vicinity of @xmath65 contribute to the integral : @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the first term can be approximated by the integral @xmath67 . in the second term",
    "we first calculate the integral over @xmath34 : @xmath68d\\phi'$ ] .",
    "if we take the limit of large @xmath60 in the inner integral , the exponential containing @xmath69 can be dropped .",
    "moreover @xmath70 becomes negligible , comparing to @xmath71 , as well as @xmath34 in the arguments of the cosine function .",
    "then for any @xmath72 we have : @xmath73 and the integral over @xmath34 can be easily evaluated .",
    "the required time dependence is of the form @xmath74 which means that the second term falls with time faster than the first one .",
    "the same conclusion refers to the higher terms .",
    "the second term has a simple asymptotic dependence also on the kernel width @xmath38 . expanding the exponential functions over @xmath75 and taking into account that @xmath76 , we find that the second term decreases like @xmath77 for large @xmath38 .",
    "we finally conclude that the acf can be well approximated by the first term of the eq.([covt ] ) and its tail is algebraic : @xmath78    fig.1 presents acf for @xmath79 ; @xmath64 was calculated from the definition , by means of single trajectories evolution according to eq.([stoch ] ) , for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the equilibrium probability distribution @xmath44 was taken as the initial condition .",
    "the result for the larger value of @xmath38 agrees very well with the first term in eq.([covt ] ) and it can be parameterized by the function @xmath82     for the jumping rate @xmath40 given by eq.([nu ] ) with @xmath79 .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed for @xmath81 ( solid line ) and @xmath80 ( dotted line ) . the first term in eq.([covt ] ) is also shown ( dashed line ) , as well as the parameterization by eq.([covt2 ] ) ( dashed - dotted line).,width=321 ]    the existence of long tails of acf means that the power spectrum of the process , defined by the fourier transform @xmath83 as @xmath84 , is strongly enhanced at @xmath85 . the power spectrum can be obtained directly from @xmath64 by using the wiener - khinchin theorem @xcite : @xmath86 .",
    "for @xmath87 we get the following result : @xmath88 then our jumping process is characterized by the algebraic power spectrum and becomes the @xmath0 noise for @xmath89 .",
    "overpopulation of small frequency values is due to the fact that the process is dominated by long waiting times between consecutive jumps .",
    "such long intervals correspond to small values of @xmath34 , i.e. to the evolution along the @xmath90 axis .",
    "a quantity @xmath91 , which means the average of the poissonian distribution ( [ poi ] ) , is well suited to characterize long rests .",
    "the statistics of @xmath92 is directly connected with the process value probability distribution @xmath44 and , in accordance with that , the density distribution of @xmath92 in the equilibrium , @xmath93 , can be derived from the equation @xmath94 . in the limit of large @xmath92",
    "we obtain @xmath95 and this result means that the poissonian waiting time distribution with variable jumping rate can possess , effectively , power law tails .",
    "the jumping process with @xmath79 resembles a deterministic dynamical system : the lorentz gas of periodically distributed hard disks . in this lattice",
    "a particle is elastically reflected by the discs and wanders freely among them .",
    "free paths of the particle are infinite at directions parallel to the symmetry axes .",
    "the system is characterized by the velocity autocorrelation function with the tail @xmath96 , analogously to eq.([covt2 ] ) , and by the power spectrum @xmath97 .",
    "however , the long free path distribution falls faster then its stochastic counterpart , like @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "if a brownian particle is driven by a stochastic force with a finite correlation time , the time evolution of the velocity obeys the generalized langevin equation @xcite : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a position - dependent external potential , @xmath101 is a stochastic force and @xmath102 denotes the mass of the particle . the integro - differential equation ( [ gle ] ) can be solved numerically for any @xmath100 if we apply a concrete model for the noise @xmath103 . in the case @xmath104 the eq.([gle ] ) is manageable by laplace transforms .",
    "we obtain the following solution : @xmath105 where the laplace transform of the resolvent @xmath106 is given by the equation @xmath107.\\ ] ]    in the eq.([gle ] ) the usual damping term ",
    "proportional to the velocity  which appears in the ordinary langevin equation , has been substituted by the retarded friction in the form of a memory kernel to ensure proper characteristics of the equilibrium , namely the equation should satisfy the second fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "the kernel @xmath108 has to be proportional to the noise acf @xmath64 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the temperature which characterizes the heat bath and @xmath111 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the introduction of memory friction changes the shape of the velocity autocorrelation function considerably : it is no longer restricted to the exponentials .",
    "we wish to demonstrate how the process described in the preceded sections can be applied as a model for the driving stochastic force in eq.([gle ] ) . for that purpose",
    "we choose acf possessing the tail @xmath1 which characterizes e.g. the noise - induced stark broadening @xcite and nuclear collisions in the framework of a dynamical model @xcite . it can be also found in problems connected with phenomena in disordered media @xcite .",
    "this form of acf is of special importance for molecular dynamics because it corresponds to the problem of scattering inside a periodic lattice @xcite .",
    "let us then consider the acf given by eq.([covt2 ] ) .",
    "moreover we assume @xmath112 . in this case @xmath113 and eq.([rods ] ) reads @xmath114 in order to obtain the resolvent @xmath106 we need to inverse the above transform .",

    "the resolvent @xmath120 has the interpretation of the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath121 , @xmath122 r(t ) falls from @xmath123 to negative values and then rises , approaching zero very slowly from below .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath124 at @xmath125 is determined by the integral in eq.([res ] ) . in this limit ,",
    "it becomes simpler : @xmath126 . integrating over @xmath60 yields the integrand in the form @xmath127 and the integral over @xmath128",
    "can be estimated @xcite as @xmath129 .",
    "the final expression reads @xmath130 therefore the tail of @xmath124 diminishes very slowly , like the tail of @xmath64 , and it is negative .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation function determines the transport properties of the system : the diffusion coefficient can be expressed in terms of the laplace transform of @xmath124 in the form : @xmath131 . since for @xmath64 given by eq.([covt2 ] ) @xmath132 , the transport is subdiffusive .",
    "we come to the same conclusion by the direct calculation of the position variance @xmath133 .",
    "integrating @xmath124 twice over time , we get the following estimation : @xmath134 therefore the subdiffusion is very weak and hardly distinguishable from the normal diffusion .",
    "the same form of the anomalous diffusion has been found in a chaotic ( deterministic ) system @xcite and it has been attributed to the intermittency .    our aim is to study the motion of the particle by a direct simulation of stochastic trajectories , assuming that the driving force in eq.([gle ] ) is modeled by means of the stochastic process @xmath9 and satisfies eq.([stoch ] ) .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case @xmath104 .",

    "the expression for acf with power - law tails has been derived .",

    "can be very long and actually algebraically distributed .",
    "this conclusion is not surprising because the mean value of the exponential distribution is also a stochastic variable .",
    "then the existence of long tails of the waiting time distribution does not rule out a relaxation to the equilibrium .",
    "the procedure described in the paper allows us to construct stochastic trajectories corresponding to a wide class of power law acf in a simple manner .",
    "therefore it can serve as a model of physical phenomena and can be used as a stochastic force in the generalized langevin equation .",
    "we have solved this equation for an exemplary form of acf , @xmath1 , utilizing our process . since waiting times",
    "are correlated with the direction of the noise vector , the resulting velocity distribution exhibits a strong anisotropy .",
    "the distribution of the first component , corresponding to long waiting times , has rapidly falling tails and indicates an extremely long memory about the initial condition , despite the fact that the comprehensive shape of the distribution equilibrates relatively fast . on the other hand , the tails of the distribution corresponding to the second component",
    "coincide with the standard gaussian .",
    "the tail of acf is determined predominantly by the long waiting times and then only one component of the process value is crucial for its shape .",
    "therefore , this component can constitute a one - dimensional counterpart of our two - dimensional jumping process which still has the power - law acf .",
    "this remark is important if one requires a model of noise possessing an arbitrary dimensionality ."
