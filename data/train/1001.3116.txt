    "we proved the correctness of the minor - embedding reduction and solved a related parameter setting problem in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the intertwined adiabatic quantum architecture design problem , which is to construct a hardware graph @xmath2 that satisfies all known physical constraints and , at the same time , permits an efficient minor - embedding algorithm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : aqc ] , we review adiabatic quantum computation , and describe an adiabatic quantum architecture that is implemented with superconducting devices and the imposing physical constraints . in section  [ sec : minor - embed ] , we recall the minor - embedding in aqc . in section",
    "[ sec : triad ] , we describe an optimal complete - graph minor hardware graph . in section  [ sec : sparse ] , we discuss the open problem for designing sparse - graph minor universal hardware graphs and the related work in literature .",
    "adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) was proposed by farhi  et  al .",
    "@xcite in 2000 as an alternative quantum paradigm to solve np - hard optimization problems , which are believed to be classically intractable .",
    "later , it was shown by aharonov  et  al .",
    "@xcite that aqc is not just limited to optimization problems , and is polynomially equivalent to conventional quantum computation ( quantum circuit model ) . in this paper , we will focus on _ quantum adiabatic optimization _ ,",
    "in which the final hamiltonian is a diagonal matrix in the computational basis . in particular , we restrict to a subclass of hamiltonians , known as _ ising hamiltonians _ : @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 resp . ) is the vertex set ( edge set resp . ) of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ( the pauli matrix @xmath11 is in the @xmath12th position ) , similarly for @xmath13 .    the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of @xmath14 are encoded in the following energy function : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , called a _",
    "spin_. in particular , the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath14 corresponding to the minimum of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 corresponds to its eigenvector ( called _ ground state _ ) of @xmath14 .",
    "hereafter , we refer the problem of finding the minimum energy of the ising model or equivalently the ground state of ising hamiltonian as the _ ising problem_.      an adiabatic quantum algorithm is described by a system hamiltonian @xmath19 for @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "there are three ingredients of @xmath23 : ( 1 ) initial hamiltonian : @xmath24 ; ( 2 ) final hamiltonian : @xmath25 ; and ( 3 ) evolution path : @xmath26 \\longrightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] , e.g. , @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath23 is an adiabatic algorithm for an optimization problem if we encode the problem into the final hamiltonian @xmath28 such that the ground state of @xmath28 corresponds to the answer to the problem .",
    "the initial hamiltonian @xmath29 is chosen to be non - commutative with @xmath28 and its ground state must be known and experimentally constructable , e.g. , @xmath30 . here @xmath31 is the running time of the algorithm . according to the adiabatic theorem , if @xmath32 evolves `` slowly '' enough , or equivalently , if @xmath31 is large enough , which is determined by the minimum spectral gap ( the difference between the two lowest energy levels ) of the system hamiltonian , the system remains at the ground state of @xmath32 , and consequently , ground state of @xmath25 gives the solution to the problem .",
    "therefore , if we set @xmath28 to be @xmath14 , @xmath23 is an adiabatic algorithm for the ising problem . in physics , @xmath33 is known as the _ ising model in a transverse field_.      a scalable superconducting architecture for adiabatic quantum computation that implements the hamiltonian of ising model in a transverse field was initially proposed by kaminsky  et  al .",

    "@xcite is building such a superconducting quantum processor .",
    "in particular , the quantum architecture is based on superconducting flux qubits connected via tunable coupling devices .",

    "see figure  [ fig : d3-triad]@xmath36 for an example .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the quantum hardware graph .",
    "each vertex @xmath37 corresponds to a qubit , and each edge @xmath38 corresponds to a coupler between qubit @xmath12 and qubit @xmath39 . in the following",
    ", we will use qubit and vertex , and coupler and edge interchangeably when there is no confusion .",
    "there are two weights , @xmath40 ( called the qubit _ bias _ ) and @xmath41 ( called the _ tunneling amplitude _ ) , associated with each qubit @xmath12 .",
    "there is a weight @xmath42 ( called the coupler _ strength _ ) associated with each coupler @xmath43 . in general , these weights are functions of time , i.e. , they vary over time , e.g. , @xmath44 .",
    "there are some known physical constraints on the quantum hardware graph ( superconductor based design ) . in particular , there is a _ degree - constraint _ in that each qubit can have at most a constant number of couplers .",
    "the coupler ( or edge ) length can not be `` too long ''",
    "( that is , all neighbor qubits are within a bounded distance ) .",
    "note that the wire of a qubit can be `` stretched '' .",
    "the shape of each qubit does not need to be a small circle .",
    "in other words , an adiabatic quantum hardware graph is a bounded - degree , edge - length bounded _ geometric graph _ ( or known as _ layout _ ) .",
    "notice that crossing is allowed ( i.e. , it can be a non - planar graph ) .",
    "given an adiabatic quantum computer that implements the ising hamiltonian , one can thus solve an ising problem on a graph @xmath0 , if @xmath0 can be embedded as a subgraph of the quantum hardware graph @xmath1 . as mentioned above , there are physical constraints on the hardware graph @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the _ degree - constraint _ of a qubit implies that the graphs that can be solved on a given hardware graph @xmath1 through subgraph embedding must also be degree - bounded .",
    "so what to do if @xmath0 is not a subgraph of the hardware graph @xmath1 ?",
    "kaminsky  et  al .",
    "@xcite observed and proposed that one can embed @xmath0 in @xmath2 through ferromagnetic coupling to solve maximum independent set ( mis ) problem ( which is a special case of the ising problem ) of planar cubic graphs ( regular graphs of degree-3 ) on an adiabatic quantum computer .",
    "in particular , they proposed an @xmath45 square lattice as a scalable hardware architecture on which all @xmath46-vertex planar cubic graphs are embeddable .",
    "the notion of embedding here follows naturally from physicists intuition that each _ logical qubit _ ( corresponding to a vertex in the input graph )",
    "is mapped to a subtree of _ physical qubits _ ( corresponding to vertices in the hardware graph ) that are ferromagnetically coupled such that each subtree of physical qubits acts like a single logical qubit .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : example - embedding ] , the logical qubit @xmath47 ( in orange color ) of the graph @xmath0 is mapped to a subtree of physical qubits ( labeled @xmath47 ) of the square lattice .    informally , a minor - embedding @xmath48 of a graph @xmath0 in the hardware graph @xmath1 is a subgraph of @xmath1 such that @xmath48 is an `` expansion '' of @xmath0 by replacing each vertex of @xmath0 with a ( connected ) subtree of @xmath1 , or equivalently , @xmath0 can be obtained from @xmath48 by contracting edges ( same color in figure  [ fig : example - embedding ] ) . in graph theory",
    ", @xmath0 is called a ( graph ) _ minor _ of @xmath1 .",
    "( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "we now formally define minor - embedding .",
    "let @xmath1 be a fixed hardware graph .",
    "given @xmath0 , the _ minor - embedding _ of @xmath0 is defined by @xmath49 such that    * each vertex in @xmath7 is mapped to a connected subtree @xmath50 of @xmath1 ; * there exists a map @xmath51 such that for each @xmath52 , there are corresponding @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 .    given @xmath0 ,",
    "if @xmath56 exists , we say that @xmath0 is _ embeddable _ in @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath56 is clear from the context , we denote the minor - embedding @xmath57 of @xmath0 by @xmath48 is also referred as @xmath0-minor . ] .",
    "see figure  [ fig : example - embedding ] for an example .",
    "in particular , there are two special cases of minor - embedding :    * _ subgraph - embedding : _ each @xmath50 consists of a single vertex in @xmath1 .",
    "that is , @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath48 ( a subgraph of @xmath1 ) . * _ topological - minor - embedding : _ each @xmath50 is a chain ( or path ) of vertices in @xmath1 .",
    "remark : the embedding in @xcite is the _ topological - minor _ embedding .    in  @xcite , we have shown that the np - hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem  @xcite ( which is equivalent to the ising problem ) on a graph @xmath0 can be solved in an adiabatic quantum computer that implements the spin-1/2 ising hamiltonian , by reduction through minor - embedding of @xmath0 in the quantum hardware graph @xmath2 . by _ reduction through minor - embedding _ ,",
    "we mean that one can reduce the original ising hamiltonian on the input graph @xmath0 to the embedded ising hamiltonian @xmath58 on its minor - embedding @xmath48 , i.e. , the solution to the embedded ising hamiltonian gives rise to the solution to the original ising hamiltonian .",
    "we proved the correctness of the minor - embedding reduction .",
    "there are two components to the reduction : _ embedding _ and _ parameter setting_. the embedding problem is to find a minor - embedding @xmath48 of a graph @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter setting problem is to set the corresponding parameters , qubit bias and coupler strengths , of the embedded ising hamiltonian . in @xcite",
    ", we solved the parameter setting problem .",
    "the embedding problem , though , is dependent on the hardware graph design problem discussed in the following sections .",
    "in this section , we describe a @xmath59-minor hardware graph , where @xmath59 is a complete graph of @xmath60 vertices .",
    "a triangular layout of a @xmath59-minor graph  @xcite , called triad , is shown in figure  [ fig : triad ] .",
    "@xmath61{complete8.pdf } & \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth , angle=90]{triad - k8.pdf }    \\end{array}\\ ] ]      the idea behind the construction of triad is to map each vertex of @xmath59 to a chain of @xmath62 `` virtual '' vertices .",

    "for example , suppose @xmath66 and @xmath67 , then it will require two physical qubits : we `` chop '' the chain of @xmath68 virtual vertices into two physical qubits : one consists of 3 virtual vertices and the other consists of 4 virtual vertices .",
    "see figure  [ fig : decomp]@xmath34 for the illustration .",
    "@xmath69{decomp1.pdf } & \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{figuredecompose2.pdf}\\\\ ( a ) & ( b ) \\end{array}\\ ] ]    [ fig : decomp2 ]    the result of such a chopping is a decomposition of @xmath59 .",
    "alternatively , we can view a complete graph @xmath59 as a combination ( disjoint union ) of two complete subgraphs of @xmath70 and a complete bipartite graph of @xmath71 .",
    "inductively , a complete graph @xmath59 ( assume @xmath72 ) can be represented as a partition of complete graph @xmath73 s and complete bipartite graph @xmath74 s , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : decomp2]@xmath36 .",
    "notice that @xmath75 is a minor of @xmath74 .",
    "for example , if @xmath67 , one can thus use @xmath76 as the basic unit for building triad . by construction , it is easy to see that triad is optimized for embedding a complete graph @xmath59 .",
    "each logical qubit ( vertex ) of @xmath59 requires at least @xmath77 physical qubits .",
    "that is , the hardware graph needs to have @xmath78 physical qubits .    in short , triad satisfies all known physical constraints and admits a simple and efficient embedding ( as illustrated in figure  [ fig : triad ] ) of @xmath59 , which thus allows for embedding any graph of @xmath60 vertices efficiently .",
    "since qubits and couplers are scarce , we are interested in designing a sparse - graph - minor hardware graph .",
    "first , we introduce the terminology of minor - universal graph .",
    "let @xmath4 consist of a set of sparse graphs ( e.g. , bounded degree graphs ) .",
    "it is also desirable that these sparse graphs are the underlying graphs of some classically hard instances .",
    "we are interested in designing a @xmath4-minor - universal graph _",
    "@xmath5 _ that is as small as possible ( in terms of number of qubits and number of couplers ) subject to both physical constraints and embedding constraint .",
    "that is , it satisfies all known physical constraints and , at the same time , a minor - embedding can be efficiently computed .",
    "the name `` minor - universal '' was naturally adopted from the `` universal graph '' .",
    "there are many studies on the construction of an universal graph ( which is a special case of a minor - universal graph ) , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "many of these work are based on the expanders which seem to have the desired properties  sparse and yet highly connected .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , all the current known explicitly constructable expanders are _ topological _ graphs and require long edge lengths , while what we need is a _ geometric _ expander .",
    "minors are well - studied in graph theory , see for example  @xcite . given a _ fixed _",
    "graph @xmath0 , there are algorithms that find a minor - embedding of @xmath0 in @xmath1 in polynomial time of size of @xmath1 , from the pioneering @xmath80 time algorithm by robertson and seymour  @xcite to the recent nearly linear time algorithm of b.  reed .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to reiterate that these algorithms are for _ fixed _",
    "@xmath0 , and their running times are _ exponential _ in the size of @xmath0 . here",
    "the minor - embedding problem is to find a minor - embedding of @xmath0 ( for any given @xmath0 ) while fixing @xmath1 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only known work related to our minor - embedding problem was by kleinberg and rubinfeld  @xcite , in which they showed that there is a randomized polynomial algorithm , based on a random walk , to find a minor - embedding in a given degree - bounded expander .",
    "however , as discussed above , the known expanders do not satisfy the physical constraints required .",
    "our embedding problem might appear similar to the embedding problem from parallel architecture studies .",
    "however , besides the different physical constraints for the design of architectures , the requirements are very different .",
    "in particular , in our embedding problem , we do not allow for _ load _ @xmath81 , which is the maximum number of logical qubits mapped to a single physical qubit .",
    "also , we require _ dilation _ , which is the maximum number of stretched edges ( through other qubits ) , to be exactly 1",
    ". however , all of the existing research on embedding problems for parallel processors  @xcite , at least one of the conditions is violated ( namely either load @xmath81 or dilation @xmath81 ) .",
    "we remark that the _ treewidth _ of @xmath5 needs to necessarily large ( @xmath82 ) for otherwise the dynamic programming over the tree - decomposition of @xmath5 would be able to solve the problem in @xmath83 time ( while polynomial in the size of the input size )  @xcite , once the embedding is given . for the quantum circuit model ,",
    "it was shown by markov & shi  @xcite that a quantum circuit with @xmath60 gates whose underlying graph has treewidth @xmath84 can be simulated in @xmath85 time .",
    "how does a minor - embedding affect the efficiency of an adiabatic algorithm ? and how do we measure the goodness of an embedding ?",
    "these problems in turn relate to the running time or complexity of quantum adiabatic algorithms . recall that",
    "according to the adiabatic theorem , the running time of an adiabatic algorithm depends on the minimum spectral gap of the system hamiltonian , which however is in general difficult to compute analytically . in order to address the time complexity of an adiabatic algorithm ,",
    "one will also need to specify the initial hamiltonian .",
    "the effect of the embedding and its consequential initial hamiltonian on the complexity of an adiabatic algorithm remains to be investigated .",
    "most of this work was done while the author was working at d - wave systems inc .",
    "i would like to thank my colleagues from whom i learn to derive this work .",
    "thanks also go to david kirkpatrick for the encouragement , advice and discussion , and bill kaminsky for the comments ."
