    "we consider a wiretap set - up , in which a message is transmitted to its legitimate receiver bob in the presence of eve the eavesdropper .",
    "eve is assumed to have unlimited computational power , but to experience an additional noise compared to bob .",
    "lattice coset coding is utilized to maximize eve s confusion , cf .",
    "bob s lattice is referred to as the code lattice or dense lattice , and eve s lattice as the sparse or coarse lattice .",
    "the channel is assumed to exhibit additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) but no fading .",
    "the respective channel equations for bob and eve are    @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the received vector , @xmath2 the transmitted coset - coded vector , and @xmath3 is awgn with respective variances @xmath4 .    in finding optimal lattice wiretap codes , there are three main objectives :    * maximizing the data rate @xmath5 , which is determined by the size of the codebook @xmath6 and the decoding delay @xmath7 as @xmath8 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) . * minimizing the legitimate receiver s decoding error probability . * minimizing the eavesdropper s probability of correct decision .    considering only the first two problems , the largest codebooks for a fixed transmission power and an upper bound for the receiver s error probability are the solutions to the widely investigated sphere - packing problem .",
    "this results in lattices that are typically nonorthogonal ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "orthogonal lattices have still traditionally been preferred due to an easy - to - implement bit - labeling algorithm , namely the gray - mapping . due to this mapping ,",
    "the encoding and decoding procedures are more straightforward for orthogonal lattices than for nonorthogonal , i.e. , skewed lattices .",
    "nevertheless , computationally efficient closest - point algorithms such as the sphere decoder also exist for nonorthogonal lattices ( for an explicit construction , see @xcite , sec . 4 ) . in @xcite",
    ", it was also demonstrated how skewed lattices can be efficiently encoded and decoded by using a modified power - controlled sphere decoder or sphere decoding adjoined with minimum - mean - square - error generalized - decision - feedback - equalization ( mmse - gdfe ) , both resulting in optimal ( maximum - likelihood ) performance . hence , skewed lattices should not be excluded when searching for optimal lattices , in particular in the light of the present paper showing that they are not only better in terms of bob s performance , but also in terms of confusing the eavesdropper .",
    "similarly to the sphere - packing problem in bob s case , we now include the third objective in our consideration .",
    "our approach is to fix the data rate and the transmission power and then compare skewed and orthogonal lattices from the point of view of the latter two objectives in an awgn channel .",
    "we study an expression that has two alternative interpretations as either the receiver s error probability ( rep ) for any lattice code in an awgn channel or the eavesdropper s correct decision probability ( ecdp ) for a lattice coset code in an awgn channel .",
    "we prove the following results ( notation will be defined in the subsequent section ) .    * skewing bob s orthogonal code lattice @xmath9 will decrease the rep of any code . * skewing eve s orthogonal sparse lattice @xmath10 will decrease the ecdp of any lattice coset code . * combining the previous two results , the common set - up of the dense lattice @xmath9 being orthogonal and the commonly used choice of an orthogonal sublattice @xmath11 are suboptimal in terms of both the ecdp and the rep . according to whether gray - labeling is insisted or not , this common set - up can be improved by either choosing a skewed sublattice of the same orthogonal dense lattice @xmath9 , leaving bob s lattice orthogonal and the rep suboptimal , or skewing both lattices .",
    "these results suggest that skewed lattices deserve more attention in the study of the awgn wiretap channels even though their encoding and decoding are admittedly somewhat more complicated than that of orthogonal lattices .",
    "it is also worthwhile to keep in mind that in any practical system , an outer error correcting code , e.g. , a low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) code , is used in addition to the inner lattice code .",
    "the true decoding bottle - neck in this case is the outer code requiring soft input , not the lattice code .",
    "in this section , we present some necessary definitions and their information - theoretic interpretations .",
    "a _ lattice _ is a discrete additive subgroup of @xmath12 .",
    "any point in a lattice @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of a _ generator matrix _ @xmath14",
    "as follows @xmath15 we assume that the columns of @xmath16 are linearly independent over @xmath17 and hence , the _ lattice coordinates _",
    "@xmath18 of a lattice point are unique .",
    "if @xmath19 , the lattice is of _ full rank_. a _ sublattice _ of a lattice of dimension @xmath20 in @xmath12 is an additive subgroup ; it has a generator matrix @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the dimension of the sublattice and for a square matrix @xmath24 , @xmath25 the _ volume _ @xmath26 of the lattice @xmath27 is the volume of the fundamental parallellotope spanned by the column vectors of @xmath16 , given by @xmath28 for full - rank lattices .",
    "differing from some information theory references , here vectors are identified with _ column _ matrices and the lattice generator vectors with the _ columns _ of the generator matrix @xmath16 .    the _ dual lattice _",
    "@xmath29 of a full - rank lattice @xmath27 generated by @xmath16 is the one generated by @xmath30    let @xmath27 be a full - rank lattice with generator @xmath16 and let @xmath31 be a continuous function with @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that the partial sums of @xmath34 converge uniformly whenever @xmath35 is restricted onto a compact set .",
    "then , @xmath36 where the fourier transform is defined as @xmath37    the proof is given in @xcite .",
    "we point out that the condition on the continuity of @xmath38 is essential for the proof and is missing in the book .",
    "the function that we will optimize is the following .",
    "the _ psi function _",
    "@xmath39 of a lattice @xmath27 at a point @xmath40 is given by @xmath41    this is a variant of lattice theta series restricted on the imaginary axis , @xmath42 .",
    "the convergence properties of the psi series follow from those of the theta series .    in @xcite , an upper approximation for the ecdp @xmath43 for a lattice coset code",
    "is derived as @xmath44 here @xmath9 is the dense and @xmath10 the sparse lattice , inteded for the receiver and the eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "the lattices are assumed to be of full rank and the eavesdropper s noise is assumed to be awgn with variance @xmath45 .",
    "the inequality is tight for large @xmath46 . for small @xmath46 ,",
    "the upper bound is larger than @xmath47 and hence useless .    on the other hand ,",
    "using the union bound technique as is done in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ii ) for rayleigh - fading channels and setting the rayleigh fading coefficients equal to one , the rep can be approximated from above as : @xmath48 this formula is valid for any lattice code @xmath9 ( not just a coset code ) in an awgn channel and the approximation is good for small receiver s noise variances @xmath49 .    based on these two formulae and the fact that the variances @xmath45 and @xmath49 vary with the random channels , our subsequent aim will be to provide inequalities of the form @xmath50 for all @xmath40 . when comparing different lattices sharing the same dimension , their volumes are first normalized to one .",
    "this ensures that for a relatively large fixed transmission power , the finite codebooks carved from the infinite lattices will be approximately equally large , and hence we can fairly compare the lattice codes without considering the actual data rates , as these will coincide .    due to the obvious connection between the formulae and for the rep and ecdp ,",
    "respectively , one would intuitively guess that a solution for the sphere - packing problem also yields an optimal ecdp .",
    "this , however , does not seem to work on the level of mathematical proofs ; eq .",
    "is obtained by the union bound technique , whereas in the sphere - packing problem , the upper bound for rep is based on integrating a gaussian function over a ball , yielding a much tighter bound for large receiver s noise variances @xmath51 or , equivalently , for small arguments of @xmath52 . to minimize the ecdp , we want to minimize @xmath52 for small arguments . hence ,",
    "even if the sphere - packing probability bound is small , it does not provide us with immediate information as to how small the @xmath52 function is for small arguments , i.e. , how small the ecdp is .",
    "in this section , we show that skewing a lattice will always improve a code both in terms of eve s and bob s probabilities .",
    "[ translation lemma ] for any full - rank lattice @xmath27 , @xmath53 for any @xmath54 .",
    "denote summands of the respective sides as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so @xmath57 .",
    "then , by the elementary properties of fourier transform , we have @xmath58 .",
    "hence , using the poisson formula , @xmath59 where @xmath16 is the generator matrix of @xmath27 . in continuation , we will use the knowledge that the fourier transform of the gaussian function @xmath60 is another gaussian , hence a real , positive and even function .",
    "( the explicit form of @xmath61 could be calculated but it is not necessary . ) first , since @xmath61 is even , the imaginary parts @xmath62 of the summand for lattice @xmath29 points @xmath63 cancel out , yielding @xmath64    next , we need the positivity of @xmath61 to be able to approximate the cosine by @xmath47 . first , note that we assumed @xmath54 , equivalently , @xmath65 with some component of @xmath66 , say the @xmath67 one @xmath68 , not integer . also note that @xmath69 where @xmath70 . hence , @xmath71 .",
    "now , choosing the lattice point @xmath72 such that @xmath73 , we immediately see that @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "hence , replacing @xmath76 by @xmath47 in the preceding step , we get a strict inequality @xmath77 where we have again applied the the poisson formula to .",
    "finally , the double fourier transform is in general a reflection operator , so @xmath78 , and using the fact that @xmath79 we obtain the result , @xmath80    [ def : skew ] let @xmath81 be a full - rank orthogonal lattice in @xmath12 with generator vectors @xmath82 , @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "we call a lattice @xmath85 a _ skewing _ of @xmath81 , if it has a generator matrix that is an upper triangular matrix with the diagonal elements @xmath86",
    ".    this definition has a simple geometric interpretation , depicted in fig . [ skewfig ] .",
    "we point out that skewing can be interpreted as a matrix operation .",
    "if @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the generator matrices of @xmath81 and @xmath89 , respectively , then the non - singular skewing matrix @xmath90 can be solved from the matrix equation @xmath91 this equation is non - singular , since @xmath92 and @xmath93 by the determinant rule of upper triangular matrices .",
    "this also implies that @xmath94 .",
    "now we are ready to state the main theorem .",
    "after this , we will provide an illustrative interpretation of the theorem and prove it .    [ skewing theorem ] for a skewing @xmath89 of a full - rank orthogonal lattice @xmath81 , @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",
    "skewings provide several easy ways to improve lattice coset codes .",
    "we point out that since skewing keeps the lattice volume constant ( @xmath94 in matrix representation ) , it will not affect the size of a spherical codebook .",
    "hence , a lattice comparison between skewings only requires considering the ecdp and the rep . with ths knowledge , the theorem has the following immediate implications .    * comparing a dense lattice @xmath97 and its skewings @xmath98 , theorem [ skewing theorem ] applied to eq .",
    "shows that the rep is always smaller for the skewings @xmath98 .",
    "this holds for all codes , not just coset codes .",
    "* consider a coset code arising from a fixed nonorthogonal lattice @xmath9 .",
    "then , to minimize the ecdp , it seems that @xmath10 should not be chosen orthogonal ( if orthogonal sublattices exist ) .",
    "note that then no skewing of the orthogonal @xmath10 is necessarily a sublattice of @xmath9 , so this is just heuristics . * consider a typical set - up of @xmath97 generated by @xmath99 being orthogonal and @xmath100 . in this case both the rep and the ocdp are suboptimal .",
    "there are two remedies : * * first , we can skew both @xmath101 and @xmath97 .",
    "skewing by @xmath90 so that the skewed lattices @xmath102 and @xmath103 are generated by @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , will yield a nonorthogonal lattices but preserve the volumes : @xmath106 ( since @xmath94 ) .",
    "hence , applying this and theorem [ skewing theorem ] in eqs . and , we see that skewing will decrease both the rep and the ecdp .",
    "however , the skewed lattice will not allow for a simple gray mapping , or in other words , the gray mapping is not guaranteed to give an optimal bit - labeling . * * second , we can only opt for skewing the sublattice @xmath10 , while leaving @xmath9 orthogonal .",
    "this means that the rep will remain suboptimal , but the lattice will allow for gray labeling and maintains simpler encoding and decoding for bob along the lines discussed in the introduction .",
    "moreover , the ecdp is decreased .",
    "the idea is that if @xmath97 is orthogonal and generated by @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , then any sublattice @xmath103 generated by @xmath21 , where @xmath24 is an upper triangular integer matrix with diagonal etries @xmath109 , is easily proven to be a skewing of @xmath110 ( or equal to @xmath110 ) .",
    "then , applying theorem [ skewing theorem ] to eq . , we see that @xmath111 will yield a lower ecdp .",
    "let us use the notation of definition [ def : skew ] .",
    "furthermore , denote by @xmath112 the embedding into @xmath113 , @xmath114 , of @xmath115 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath112 is the lattice in @xmath113 generated by the @xmath23 first columns of the generator @xmath88 of @xmath89 . continuing to ease the notation ,",
    "denote the projection of the @xmath116 column of @xmath88 onto @xmath117 by @xmath118 , so the @xmath116 column is @xmath119 .",
    "now , it is apparent from the definition of @xmath120 that @xmath121 and that @xmath122 on the other hand , using lemma [ translation lemma ] for the lattice @xmath123 , @xmath124 , which is a full - rank lattice of @xmath117 , we obtain    @xmath125    and , as stated in lemma [ translation lemma ] , the equality holds if and only if @xmath126 for all @xmath127 , equivalently , @xmath128 .",
    "this is furthermore equivalent to that the @xmath116 column @xmath119 of @xmath88 can be replaced by @xmath129 without changing the lattice @xmath89 .",
    "next , starting from eq .",
    ", using the identity inductively , and finally using eq . , we obtain @xmath130 the equality holds if and only if it has been possible to modify , for all @xmath23 , the @xmath116 column of @xmath88 into @xmath131 without changing the lattice generated by @xmath88 . but",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath88 and @xmath132 generating the same orthogonal lattice @xmath81 .",
    "this is impossible by the definition of a skewing .",
    "hence , for any skewing @xmath89 of @xmath81 , we have a strict inequality @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",
    "this completes the proof .    the gosset lattice @xmath133 has the generator matrix @xmath88 given by @xcite    @xmath134    so it is a skewing of the orthogonal lattice @xmath27 generated by @xmath135 .",
    "the theta series of the gosset lattice is expressible by the jacobi theta functions as @xcite @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "the theta series of the orthogonal lattice @xmath27 is @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 is the @xmath67 diagonal element of @xmath87 .",
    "now , recalling that @xmath42 , we can compare the psi series of these two lattices by evaluating jacobi theta functions .",
    "the plots of the psi functions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ psi_skewings ] .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath141 for all @xmath142 , as predicted by theorem [ skewing theorem ] .    in coset coding",
    ", this has the following interpretation : @xmath133 and @xmath27 are both index @xmath143 subgroups of @xmath144 .",
    "if bob s lattice is @xmath144 , then the coset lattices @xmath133 and @xmath27 will yield the same code rates , but @xmath133 with a better secrecy .     and its skewing @xmath133.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in the construction of lattice codes for awgn wiretap channels , skewed lattices should be taken more seriously .",
    "namely , we have proved that orthogonal lattices are suboptimal not only in terms of the receiver s error probability as we already know from the sphere - packing theorems , but also in terms of the eavesdropper s correct decision probability when using lattice coset codes .",
    "hence , the design of secure lattice codes should ideally be based on skewed lattices .",
    "however , due to implementation purposes , one may opt for only skewing the eavesdropper s lattice , while preserving the orthogonality of the legitimate receiver s lattice , which results in suboptimal performance but easy - to - implement algorithms for bob , as well as improved security .",
