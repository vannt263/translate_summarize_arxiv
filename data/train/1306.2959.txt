    "one of the most urgent problems facing particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology today is that of understanding the nature of dark matter .",
    "fortunately , a confluence of emerging data from direct - detection , indirect - detection , and collider experiments suggests that major progress may soon be at hand .",
    "a potentially important ingredient in this mix may involve recent results  @xcite from the experiment on the flux of cosmic - ray positrons at energies up to @xmath0  gev .",
    "these results confirm the anomalous and puzzling results observed by earlier cosmic - ray detectors such as heat  @xcite , ams-01  @xcite , pamela  @xcite , and fermi  @xcite which indicate that the positron fraction  , the ratio of the differential flux @xmath1 of cosmic - ray positrons to the combined differential flux @xmath2 of cosmic - ray electrons and positrons  actually rises as a function of particle energy @xmath3 for energies @xmath4  gev .",
    "since the positron fraction is generally expected to fall with energy in this energy range , the observed positron excess suggests that some unanticipated physics might be in play . while many possibilities exist",
    ", one natural idea is that these positrons may be produced via the annihilation or decay of dark - matter particles within the galactic halo .",
    "unfortunately , this rise in the positron flux occurs without any other distinctive features , and no downturn at high energies  a standard prediction of the most straightforward dark - matter models  is apparent .",
    "this rise in the positron fraction therefore poses a major challenge for any potential interpretation in terms of dark - matter physics .    at first glance",
    ", it might seem relatively straightforward to interpret the observed positron excess in terms of annihilating or decaying dark - matter particles within the galactic halo .",
    "however , such a dark - matter interpretation of the cosmic - ray positron excess is tightly constrained by a number of additional considerations .",
    "for example , no corresponding excess is observed in the flux of cosmic - ray antiprotons  @xcite , a fact which significantly constrains the particle - physics properties of possible dark - matter candidates .",
    "indeed , these constraints are particularly severe for dark - matter candidates which annihilate or decay either predominately to strongly - interacting standard - model ( sm ) particles or to particles such as @xmath5 or @xmath6 whose subsequent decays produce such particles with significant frequency .",
    "for this reason , the most natural dark - matter candidates which can explain the observed positron excess are those which annihilate or decay primarily to charged leptons .",
    "however , even such `` leptophilic '' dark - matter candidates are significantly constrained by cosmic - ray data .",
    "precise measurements of the combined flux spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons and positrons by the fermi collaboration  @xcite further restrict the range of viable dark - matter models of the observed positron excess .",
    "moreover , constraints on the production of photons are also quite stringent .",
    "for example , high - energy photons produced by a cosmological population of dark - matter particles contribute to the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background which has been measured by the fermi collaboration  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the energy released via the annihilation or decay of dark - matter particles in the early universe can also lead to a reionization of the thermal plasma at or after the time of last scattering .",
    "this in turn induces a modification of the observed temperature and polarization fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .   as a result",
    ", cmb data from boomerang  @xcite , acbar  @xcite , wmap  @xcite , and planck  @xcite significantly constrain the rate at which dark matter can annihilate or decay during and after the recombination epoch .",
    "a number of scenarios have been advanced over the past decade to reconcile the observed positron fraction with these additional constraints  @xcite . as these constraints have sharpened over time ,",
    "the corresponding dark - matter models have also grown in complexity and sophistication  a trend which has only continued  @xcite since the release of the most recent data .",
    "for example , one current possibility  @xcite involves a dark - matter particle which annihilates or decays into exotic intermediate states which only subsequently decay into @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "other possibilities  @xcite involve dark - matter particles which decay primarily via three - body processes of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an additional , lighter dark - sector field and where @xmath11 .",
    "there also exist other three - body - decay models  @xcite in which all of the final states are in the visible sector . in each case",
    ", these features are required in order to ensure that the resulting electron and positron flux spectra are significantly `` softer '' ( , broader , more gently sloped ) than those produced by a dark - matter particle undergoing a two - body decay directly to sm states .",
    "indeed , only such softer spectra can provide a satisfactory combined fit to the observed positron fraction and to the @xmath12 flux spectrum observed by fermi while simultaneously satisfying all other phenomenological constraints .",
    "taken together , these attempts have led to certain expectations concerning the nature of the dark - matter particle whose decays or annihilations might explain the positron excess .",
    "specifically , it is expected that this dark - matter particle will not undergo two - body decays to standard - model states , but will instead decay through more complex decay patterns such as those involving non - trivial intermediate states or three - body final states . as discussed above ,",
    "this is necessary in order to soften the kinematic spectrum associated with such single - particle dark - matter candidates .",
    "second , it is also expected that such dark - matter particles must be relatively heavy , with masses @xmath13(tev ) , in order to properly explain the measured positron excess .",
    "this is unfortunate , since leptophilic particles with such heavy masses are typically difficult to probe via other experiments ( , existing collider experiments ) which provide complementary probes of the dark sector .",
    "finally , we note that all current dark - matter - based attempts at explaining the observed positron excess inevitably predict that the positron fraction will experience a relatively sharp downturn at energies which do not greatly exceed current sensitivities .",
    "indeed , a relatively sharp downturn is in some sense required by the decay kinematics of such dark - matter candidates .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that dynamical dark matter ( ddm )  @xcite can provide an entirely different perspective on these issues .",
    "first , we shall demonstrate that a leptonically - decaying ddm ensemble can successfully account for the observed positron excess and combined cosmic - ray @xmath14 flux without running afoul of any other applicable constraints on decaying or annihilating dark - matter particles .",
    "second , we shall show that ddm can do this entirely with dark - matter components undergoing simple two - body decays to leptons  indeed , more complicated decay phenomenologies are not required .",
    "third , we shall find that the ddm components which play the dominant role in explaining the positron excess are themselves relatively light , with masses only in the @xmath15  gev range .",
    "this is an important distinction relative to more traditional models , opening up the possibility of correlating these positron - flux signatures with possible missing - energy signatures in collider experiments .",
    "this would then allow a more tightly constrained , complementary approach to studying such dark - matter candidates . indeed , as we shall see , ddm accomplishes all of these feats by providing an _ alternative _ method of softening the flux spectra  not through a complicated set of dark - matter decay / annihilation channels ( and thus complicated particle kinematics ) , but instead through a richer and more complex dark sector itself .",
    "but perhaps most importantly , we shall show that ddm also makes a fairly firm prediction for the positron fraction at energies _ beyond _ 350  gev : the positron fraction will level off and remain roughly constant all the way up to energies of approximately @xmath16  tev .",
    "indeed , as we shall find , this behavior for the positron fraction emerges for most of the viable regions of ddm parameter space .",
    "hence , within such regions , the ddm framework predicts that no abrupt downturn in the positron fraction will be seen .",
    "this is a marked difference relative to most traditional dark - matter models which seek to explain the positron excess : indeed , most of these models predict either a continuing rise in the positron fraction or the onset of a downturn , but can not easily accommodate a relatively flat plateau .",
    "thus , if we interpret the positron excess seen by as resulting from dark - matter annihilations or decays , a relatively flat plateau in the positron fraction at energies less than 1  tev may be taken as a `` smoking gun '' of dynamical dark matter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ensembles ] , we briefly review the general properties of ddm ensembles and introduce the general parametrizations we shall use in order to characterize these ensembles in our analysis . in sect .  [",
    "sec : propagation ] , we then discuss the @xmath14 injection spectra produced by the decays of a ddm ensemble and show how these spectra are modified upon propagation through the interstellar medium . in sect .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] , we then discuss the additional considerations which further constrain decaying dark - matter candidates and examine how these considerations apply to ddm ensembles .",
    "our main results appear in sect .  [",
    "sec : results ] , where we demonstrate that ddm ensembles can indeed reproduce the observed positron excess while simultaneously satisfying all relevant constraints  even with relatively light ddm constituents undergoing simple two - body leptonic decays .",
    "we also demonstrate that most of the viable ddm parameter space leads to the prediction of a positron fraction which levels off and remains roughly constant out to energies of approximately @xmath16  tev .",
    "even though ( as we shall see ) there exist other regions of viable ddm parameter space for which the predicted positron excess can experience a downturn ( or even an oscillation ! )  as a function of energy , we shall explain why we nevertheless believe that the existence of a plateau in the positron fraction can serve as a `` smoking gun '' for the dynamical dark matter framework as a whole .",
    "in section  [ sec : varyinginputs ] , we then discuss the extent to which these results continue to apply when our fundamental theoretical assumptions and computational procedures are altered . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude with a summary of our results and a discussion of their implications for distinguishing between decaying ddm ensembles and other proposed explanations for the positron excess , including those involving purely traditional astrophysical sources .",
    "dynamical dark matter ( ddm )  @xcite is an alternative framework for dark - matter physics in which the requirement of dark - matter stability is replaced by a balancing of lifetimes against cosmological abundances across an ensemble of individual dark - matter components with different masses , lifetimes , and abundances .",
    "it is this ddm ensemble which collectively serves as the dark - matter `` candidate '' in the ddm framework , and which collectively carries the observed dark - matter abundance @xmath17 .",
    "likewise , it is the balancing between lifetimes and abundances across the ensemble as a whole which ensures the phenomenological viability of the ddm framework  @xcite . in some sense",
    "the ddm ensemble is the most general dark sector that can be envisioned , reducing to a standard stable dark - matter candidate in the limit that the number of dark - matter components is taken to one .",
    "however , in all other cases , stability is not an absolute requirement in the ddm framework ( a feature which distinguishes ddm from other multi - component dark - matter scenarios ) , but instead depends , component by component , on the corresponding cosmological abundances . as has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , ddm ensembles appear naturally in many extensions to the standard model , including string theory and theories with large extra spacetime dimensions , and not only possess a highly non - trivial cosmology but can also lead to many striking signatures at colliders  @xcite and direct - detection experiments  @xcite  signatures which transcend those associated with traditional dark - matter candidates . indeed , ddm ensembles are fairly ubiquitous , and can also potentially arise in a variety of additional contexts ranging from theories such as the axiverse  @xcite to theories involving large hidden - sector gauge groups and even theories exhibiting warped stringy throats  @xcite .    it is the purpose of this paper to examine the behavior of the positron flux within the context of the general ddm framework , and thereby study the implications of the ddm framework for _ indirect_-detection experiments . because the ddm framework lacks dark - matter stability as a founding principle , discussions of decaying dark matter ( such as those possibly leading to a cosmic - ray positron excess ) are particularly relevant for ddm .",
    "indeed , one important characteristic of ddm is that the ddm dark sector includes particles whose lifetimes can in principle collectively span a vast range of timescales from well before to long after the present day .",
    "understanding the impacts of such decays for present - day cosmic - ray physics is therefore of paramount importance .",
    "because our goal in this paper is to explore the cosmic - ray phenomenology to which ddm ensembles can give rise , we shall avoid focusing on a specific ddm model and instead assume a general ensemble configuration of individual dark - matter components @xmath18 whose masses @xmath19 are given by a relation of the form @xmath20 where the mass splitting @xmath21 and scaling exponent @xmath22 are both assumed positive .",
    "thus the index @xmath23 labels the ensemble constituents in order of increasing mass .",
    "likewise , we shall assume that these components @xmath18 have cosmological abundances @xmath24 and decay widths @xmath25 which can be parametrized according to general scaling relations of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are general power - law exponents . while the existence of such scaling relations is not a fundamental requirement of the ddm framework , relations such as these do arise naturally in a number of explicit realistic ddm models  @xcite and allow us to encapsulate the structure of an entire ddm ensemble in terms of only a few well - motivated parameters .",
    "note that the decay width @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaomegascaling ] ) refers to ( or is otherwise assumed to be dominated by ) the decay of @xmath18 to sm states , and likewise @xmath24 denotes the cosmological abundance that @xmath18 _ would have had _ at the present time if it had been absolutely stable .",
    "indeed , because the ddm framework allows each individual @xmath18 component to decay at a different time , the corresponding abundances @xmath24 generally evolve in a non - trivial manner across the ddm ensemble  @xcite , and thus no single scaling relation can hold across the ensemble for all times .",
    "given these scaling relations , our ddm ensemble is in principle described by the seven parameters @xmath29 . for convenience , in this paper we shall fix @xmath30 and @xmath31  gev ; these choices ensure that our ddm ensemble transcends a mere set of individual dark - matter components and observationally acts as a `` continuum '' of states relative to the scale set by the energy resolution of the relevant cosmic - ray detectors .",
    "we shall also fix @xmath32 by requiring that the ensemble carry the entire observed dark - matter abundance @xmath33 ; this will be discussed further below . of the remaining four parameters ,",
    "we shall treat @xmath34 as free parameters and eventually survey over different possibilities within the ranges @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "given a specific assumption for how each @xmath18 decays to standard - model states , we will then find that each such choice of @xmath34 leads to a unique prediction for the overall shape of the resulting electron and positron fluxes as functions of energy , with an arbitrary normalization set by the lifetime @xmath38 of the lightest dark - matter component in the ensemble .",
    "for each choice of @xmath34 , the final remaining parameter @xmath39 can therefore be determined through a best - fit analysis , and indeed we shall find that most scenarios of interest have @xmath40  s. thus , in this paper , the three quantities @xmath34 shall serve as our independent degrees of freedom parametrizing our ddm ensemble .    there are also additional phenomenological considerations which can be used to place bounds on these parameters .",
    "for example , one generic feature of the ddm framework is an expected balancing of decay widths against abundances across the ddm ensemble .",
    "this expectation comes from the general observation that the earlier a dark - matter component might decay during the evolution of the universe , the smaller its cosmological abundance must be in order to avoid the disruptive effects of that decay and remain phenomenologically viable  @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect to find , roughly speaking , an _ inverse _ relation between cosmological abundances and decay widths , or equivalently that @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , as indicated above , it is usually @xmath27 which will be negative in most ddm scenarios , while @xmath28 is generally positive .",
    "however , for illustrative purposes , in this paper we shall also occasionally consider extrapolations into regions of parameter space with @xmath42 .    likewise , in this paper we also shall focus on regions of parameter space in which @xmath28 is not too large .",
    "our reasons , again , are primarily phenomenological . in general , our interest in this paper concerns the contributions that the dark - matter components @xmath18 might , through their decays , make to the differential electron / positron fluxes @xmath43 within the energy range @xmath44  tev .   one of the most interesting regions of parameter space will therefore be that in which all of the @xmath18 which could in principle yield a non - negligible contribution to these fluxes are sufficiently long - lived that their abundances @xmath24 are effectively undiminished by decays and consequently still scale according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaomegascaling ] ) at the present time .",
    "indeed , this is the regime within which the full ddm ensemble plays the most significant role in indirect - detection phenomenology and within which the most distinctive signatures arise . in order to specify where this regime lies within the parameter space of our ddm model , we begin by noting that the contribution from extremely heavy dark - matter components @xmath18 to @xmath43 will be comparatively negligible ( , below background ) for @xmath45  tev .",
    "we therefore define a fiducial mass scale @xmath46 to represent this cutoff , and demand that all components @xmath18 with masses @xmath47 have lifetimes @xmath48 , where @xmath49  s is the age of the universe . the scaling relation for @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaomegascaling ] ) implies that this condition may be written as a constraint on the scaling exponent @xmath28 : @xmath50 for any ensemble with @xmath51  s and @xmath52  gev , we find that the conservative choice @xmath53  gev yields the limit @xmath54 . as we shall see in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , it is not difficult to satisfy the condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaconsistencycondit ] ) while simultaneously reproducing the positron - fraction curve reported by and satisfying all other applicable constraints . however , we hasten to emphasize that the criterion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaconsistencycondit ] ) does _ not _ represent a parameter - space constraint which our ddm model must satisfy for theoretical or phenomenological consistency . by contrast , it merely defines a regime of particular phenomenological interest within our model .",
    "finally , in order to evaluate the contribution to the observed cosmic - ray electron and positron fluxes from such a ddm ensemble , it is necessary to specify not only the particle - physics properties of the ddm ensemble itself but also certain astrophysical properties of the ensemble which characterize how the populations of the various @xmath18 are distributed throughout the galactic halo .",
    "first , for this analysis , we assume that the ddm ensemble contributes essentially the entirety of the present - day dark - matter abundance , and therefore that the total ddm ensemble abundance @xmath55 matches the total dark - matter abundance @xmath56 observed by wmap  @xcite .",
    "( although recent planck results  @xcite suggest the slightly higher value @xmath57 , such a shift in @xmath33 has an essentially negligible effect on our results . )",
    "note that since we are considering only those ddm ensembles for which @xmath58 , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegatot ] ) remains convergent in the @xmath59 limit  @xcite .",
    "second , we make the simplifying assumption that the density profiles @xmath60 according to which our individual dark - matter components @xmath18 are distributed within the galactic halo share a common functional form , which we model using an nfw profile  @xcite . finally , for simplicity , we take the normalization of each @xmath60 within the galactic halo  which is typically specified by the local dark - matter density @xmath61 within the solar neighborhood  to be proportional to the global energy density of the corresponding constituent .",
    "thus , we shall assume that @xmath62 in what follows , with @xmath63 .",
    "in general , a given dark - matter particle @xmath64 undergoes a decay of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a multi - particle final state which includes at least some visible - sector fields . using only visible - sector physics , one",
    "can then extract a set of differential electron and positron fluxes @xmath67 which reflect not only the kinematics of how @xmath66 subsequently decays to electrons and positrons , but also the possible decay chains and branching ratios that might be involved in such subsequent processes , the effects of final - state radiation , and so forth .",
    "however , @xmath67 only describes the differential fluxes at the location where these electrons and positrons were originally produced ( here assumed to be somewhere within our galaxy ) ; it is still necessary to use this so - called `` injection '' spectrum @xmath67 in order to determine the final electron and positron differential fluxes @xmath43 that will emerge and be measured after these particles have propagated through the interstellar medium ( ism ) and entered our solar neighborhood . in this section , we shall discuss how these final observed differential fluxes @xmath43 may be determined , focusing on the case when our injection spectrum @xmath67 arises from an entire ddm ensemble .",
    "note , in particular , that our interest in this paper centers on the _ differential _ fluxes @xmath43 ; these quantities are related to the _ total _ fluxes @xmath68 via @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , it is only the differential fluxes @xmath43 which exhibit the all - important energy - dependence which is ultimately the focus of our analysis . in this vein",
    ", we also note that we are only concerned in this paper with total differential fluxes integrated over all angles , and not with their directional dependence .      following ref .",
    "@xcite , we next adopt a stationary two - zone diffusion model in which the diffusion coefficient is spatially constant throughout the diffusion zone and takes the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are free parameters which characterize a particular diffusion model and where @xmath85 is the so - called `` rigidity '' of the particle ( defined as the ratio of its momentum in gev to its electromagnetic charge in units of the electron charge @xmath86 ) . note that for electrons and positrons with @xmath87  kev , the diffusion coefficient may also be expressed as @xmath88 .",

    "the functional forms for @xmath90 , the @xmath91 , and the @xmath93 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "finally , the diffusion zone is assumed to be cylindrical , with a radius @xmath94 and half height @xmath95 .",
    "for this analysis we adopt the so - called `` med '' propagation model of refs .",

    "( [ eq : transportequation ] ) .",
    "indeed , this equation indicates that the differential flux which results from the decaying ddm ensemble is nothing but the sum of the individual differential fluxes which would have resulted from the decays of each ddm component individually  precisely as expected for an essentially linear propagation model wherein the green s function @xmath108 encapsulates the essence of propagation through the interstellar medium .    for a ddm ensemble parametrized as in sect .",

    "we shall now discuss each of these in turn .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , limits from pamela  @xcite on the flux of cosmic - ray antiprotons impose non - trivial constraints on dark - matter models which purport to explain the positron excess .",
    "these constraints are particularly stringent for dark - matter candidates which decay primarily either directly into quarks or gluons , or else into @xmath5 or @xmath6 bosons which in turn produce such particles with significant branching fractions via their subsequent decays .",
    "however , these constraints are far less stringent for dark - matter candidates which decay primarily into charged leptons . for this reason , in our analysis we shall focus primarily on the case in which the constituents of the ddm ensemble decay leptonically , via processes of the form @xmath128 , where @xmath129 . in each case",
    ", we have used the pppc4dmid package  @xcite to calculate the contribution to the cosmic - ray antiproton flux from the leptonic decays of our ddm ensemble , and we have verified that the antiproton flux lies well below experimental limits for all relevant antiproton energies . indeed , this conclusion holds within all portions of the ddm parameter space which ultimately prove relevant for explaining the positron excess .",
    "we emphasize that while other similar limits on decaying dark - matter particles exist  for example , constraints on the contributions of such particles to cosmic - ray antideuteron fluxes  these constraints do not significantly impact the parameter space of ddm ensembles whose constituents decay primarily via leptonic channels .      the flux of gamma rays produced from annihilating or decaying dark - matter particles within the galactic halo is also tightly constrained by observation , as is the contribution from a cosmological population of decaying dark - matter particles to the isotropic gamma - ray flux .",
    "the latter constraints are typically more stringent for decaying dark - matter models  @xcite ; moreover , they do not depend on the halo profile or other unknown properties of the dark - matter distribution within our galaxy .",
    "we therefore focus here on the isotropic gamma - ray constraints .",
    "in general , the total contribution to the apparent isotropic gamma - ray flux from dark - matter decay receives two sub - contributions : @xmath130 the first of these is the contribution from a cosmological population of decaying dark - matter particles to the true diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray flux .",
    "the second is the isotropic component of the residual contribution from decaying dark - matter particles in the galactic halo .",
    "this latter contribution includes individual contributions from prompt gamma - ray production and from gamma - ray production via the inverse - compton scattering of @xmath14 produced by @xmath18 decays off background photons .",
    "we evaluate both of these contributions to the residual galactic background flux , as well as the truly diffuse extragalactic flux contribution , using the pppc4dmid package  @xcite . following the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the direction at which this latter contribution reaches a minimum is that opposite the galactic center .    since there is substantial uncertainty in the background contribution to the isotropic gamma - ray flux from astrophysical sources ( see , , the various possible contributions discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we require as a consistency condition only that the contribution to this flux predicted from the decay of a given ddm ensemble alone not exceed the flux reported by the fermi collaboration  @xcite . in this manner ,",
    "given a particular choice of model parameters , we determine a lower bound on the lifetime @xmath39 of the lightest ensemble constituent .",
    "we do this by computing the goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath131 where the index @xmath132 labels the energy bins into which the fermi data are partitioned , where @xmath133 is the differential gamma - ray flux for bin @xmath132 predicted by the ddm model in question , where @xmath134 is the central value reported by fermi for the gamma - ray flux in the corresponding bin , where @xmath135 is the uncertainty in that central value , and where @xmath136 denotes the heaviside theta function .",
    "we then compute a ( one - sided ) @xmath137-value by comparing this goodness - of - fit statistic to a @xmath138 distribution with @xmath139 degrees of freedom , where @xmath140 is the number of energy bins used in the fermi gamma - ray analysis .",
    "finally , we express this result in terms of the number of standard deviations away from the mean to which this @xmath137-value would correspond for a ( two - sided ) gaussian distribution . in this analysis ,",
    "we adopt as our criterion for consistency with fermi data the requirement that the isotropic gamma - ray flux contributed by the decays of the ddm ensemble constituents agree with the fermi data to within @xmath141 .",
    "we note , however , that there also exist other methods  @xcite of using fermi gamma - ray data to constrain the properties of decaying or annihilating dark matter .",
    "gamma - ray signatures of this sort are not the only way in which photon signals constrain the properties of the dark matter .",
    "indeed , synchrotron radiation produced via the interaction between high - energy electrons and positrons within the galactic halo and background magnetic fields can result in an observable radio signal .",
    "observational limits on such a signal therefore constrain scenarios in which electrons and positrons are produced by a population of annihilating  @xcite or decaying  @xcite dark - matter particles",
    ". constraints of this sort were derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a traditional dark - matter candidate @xmath142 which decays primarily into charged leptons , and in particular into @xmath143 pairs . for the choice of halo profile and propagation model",
    "we adopt here , it was shown that these constraints are generically subleading in comparison with direct constraints on the positron fraction for @xmath144  gev .",
    "indeed , the most stringent bound on the lifetime of any leptonically - decaying @xmath142 with @xmath145 in this mass regime from synchrotron - emission considerations alone is @xmath146  s , again for a particle which decays essentially exclusively to @xmath143 .",
    "( the corresponding constraints on a particle with a significant branching fraction to @xmath147 or @xmath148 are even less stringent  @xcite . )",
    "since the above results hold for a single dark - matter component @xmath142 with @xmath149  gev , they will necessarily hold component - by - component across our entire ddm ensemble so long as @xmath150  gev and @xmath151 . as we shall see , this latter condition is necessary in order to ensure that the injection energy decreases as a function of increasing mass within the ensemble .",
    "we therefore conclude that the synchrotron - emission constraints will always be less stringent than the limits on @xmath1 from fermi and data for any ddm ensemble satisfying these two constraints .",
    "in addition to direct limits on the observed gamma - ray and synchrotron fluxes , dark - matter decays in the early universe are also constrained by considerations related to the cmb .",
    "in particular , high - energy photons , electrons , and positrons produced as a result of dark - matter decays in the early universe can alter the ionization history of the universe , thereby leaving an observable imprint on the cmb .   that no such imprint has been observed in cmb data implies stringent constraints  @xcite on dark - matter annihilation and decay .",
    "forthcoming cmb - polarization data from planck will improve upon these limits , and projections based on the expected performance of the planck satellite for the case of a single long - lived dark - matter particle @xmath142 have been assessed by a number of authors  @xcite .    broadly speaking ,",
    "the results of these studies indicate that such a dark - matter particle @xmath142 must have a lifetime @xmath152  s if it is to have a cosmological abundance @xmath153 , and that the upper limit on the present - day abundance of such a long - lived particle drops rapidly as the lifetime of the particle decreases .",
    "these studies also indicate that the upper bound on @xmath154 is not particularly sensitive to the mass of @xmath142 .",
    "2.75 truein   0.2 truein 2.75 truein + 5.00 truein    a precise determination of the corresponding limits on the parameter space of any given ddm scenario would require a detailed re - analysis of the ionization history of the universe in the presence of a ddm ensemble .",
    "however , we can derive a rough criterion for consistency with cmb data from the usual cmb limits on decaying dark - matter particles based on the observation that such limits essentially constrain the energy injection from dark - matter decays  @xcite , and that these constraints are not particularly sensitive to the mass of the decaying particle .",
    "indeed , for any such particle with a lifetime @xmath155  s , the projected planck limits derived in ref .",
    "@xcite essentially amount to a constraint @xmath156 .",
    "we can therefore establish a rough criterion for consistency with cmb data by imposing an analogous condition on the total energy injection from the ddm ensemble as a whole : @xmath157 indeed , for the specific case of a ddm ensemble parametrized as in sect .",

    "the underlying reason for this success is easy to understand upon comparison with the case of a traditional dark - matter candidate with the same decay phenomenology . in a nutshell ,",
    "the @xmath14 injection spectra associated with traditional dark - matter candidates with the same decay phenomenologies are generally too hard , and thus can not match the softer data after propagation through the ism .",
    "by contrast , in the ddm framework , the total dark - matter cosmological abundance @xmath33 is partitioned across an ensemble of individual constituents with different masses .",

    "for such a heavy dark - matter candidate , it is difficult at the same time to reproduce the combined fermi flux @xmath12 ; moreover , for such candidates , constraints related to the gamma - ray flux are quite severe .",
    "however , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : significancecontourplot ] that the preferred region of parameter space for our ddm model is one in which a significant fraction of the dark - matter cosmological abundance @xmath33 is carried by constituents with masses in the range @xmath187 . for such light particles ,",
    "the gamma - ray constraints are less severe .",
    "it is this observation which lies at the heart of the phenomenological success of the ddm ensemble .",
    "moreover , according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the preferred regions of ddm parameter space indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : significancecontourplot ] correspond directly to those regions in which the full ddm ensemble contributes meaningfully to the cosmological dark - matter abundance @xmath33 ( as opposed to regions in which the single most - abundant constituent effectively carries the entirety of @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , we see that it is the full set of degrees of freedom within the ddm ensemble which play a role in achieving this outcome .",
    "having demonstrated that ddm ensembles can successfully reproduce the positron fraction reported by , we now turn to the all - important question of how the predicted ddm positron fraction behaves at energies @xmath188  gev .   in this way",

    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fanplot ] . in this figure , superimposed on the actual experimental data , we have plotted the predicted combined flux and positron fraction which correspond to a variety of ddm parameter choices that lie within those regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : significancecontourplot ] for which our curves agree with data to within @xmath141 . the color of each such curve reflects the significance level to which the predicted and observed positron fractions agree , using the same color scheme as in fig .  [ fig : significancecontourplot ] .",
    "we emphasize once again that the values of @xmath39 and @xmath119 for each curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fanplot ] are those for which the best fit to the positron fraction is obtained , irrespective of the goodness of fit to the combined @xmath14 flux , provided that this goodness of fit corresponds to a statistical significance of at most @xmath141 . as a result ,",
    "the curves shown in the left panel of this figure essentially all deviate from fermi data at the @xmath141 significance level .",
    "however , substantially improved consistency with fermi data can easily be achieved without significantly sacrificing consistency with data  , by employing an alternative fitting procedure involving a combined fit to both data sets simultaneously .",
    "note also that the fit to fermi data depends on a number of assumptions concerning the astrophysical background flux , and not merely its normalization ; hence small deviations from fermi @xmath12 results are not necessarily to be taken as a sign of tension with data .",
    "we immediately see from fig .  [",
    "fig : fanplot ] that ddm ensembles give rise to unusual and distinctive positron - fraction curves whose behaviors at high energies differ significantly from those obtained for traditional dark - matter models . indeed , traditional dark - matter models for explaining the observed positron excess predict a rather pronounced downturn at @xmath189 ( for annihilating dark matter ) or @xmath190 ( for decaying dark matter ) , where @xmath145 denotes the mass of the dark - matter particle .",
    "by contrast , as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : fanplot ] , ddm ensembles give rise to positron - fraction curves which either decline only gradually or remain effectively flat for @xmath191  gev .   indeed , we see that @xmath192 over this entire range . in principle",
    ", of course , ddm ensembles can give rise to positron - fraction curves exhibiting a broad variety of shapes and features .",
    "however , imposing the requirements that the positron fraction and combined @xmath14 flux agree with current data substantially limits the high - energy behaviors for the resulting positron fraction , permitting only those curves for which this fraction levels off and remains relatively constant as a function of energy .",
    "since no sharp downturn in the positron fraction appears consistent within the ddm framework , we may take this to be an actual prediction of the framework .",
    "the presence or absence of such a downturn therefore offers a powerful tool for distinguishing decaying ddm ensembles from other dark - matter explanations of the positron excess .",
    "even more importantly , however , we observe that a positron fraction which falls only gradually or which remains effectively constant for @xmath191  gev can be achieved only in a scenario in which an ensemble of dark - matter states with different masses and decay widths act together in coordinated fashion in order to support the positron - fraction function against collapse and to carry it smoothly into this higher energy range .",
    "this behavior , if eventually observed experimentally , can therefore be taken as a virtual `` smoking gun '' of dynamical dark matter .",
    "this claim , of course , rests upon the fundamental assumption that we are attributing the positron excess to dark - matter physics . as we have indicated above , it is always possible that some configuration of pulsars or other astrophysical sources can also provide part or all of the explanation for the observed positron excess . given this observation",
    ", it may initially seem that our conclusions regarding the spectra predicted by the ddm framework may be somewhat moot .",
    "however , the success of the ddm framework not only in accommodating the existing positron data but also in predicting the continuation of the positron excess out to 1  tev can be taken , conversely , as indicating that one need not be forced into a conclusion involving traditional astrophysical sources should such phenomena be observed experimentally . indeed , as we have shown , there exists a well - motivated dark - matter framework  namely that involving a ddm ensemble obeying well - ordered scaling relations  which can easily do the job .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that the ddm framework can naturally accommodate the positron excess , that this framework actually predicts that the positron excess will continue out to energies of at least approximately @xmath193  tev , and that any future experimental verification of this prediction can actually be taken ( within the confines of dark - matter interpretations of the positron excess ) as a `` smoking gun '' for ddm .   however , there are a number of input assumptions which have either explicitly or implicitly played a role in our analysis  some of these concern the structure of the ddm ensemble itself , while others concern the background astrophysical environment whose properties also enter into our calculations .",
    "it is therefore critical that we understand the extent to which our results are robust against variations in these input assumptions .      as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : ensembles ] , our ddm ensemble can be parametrized in terms of five fundamental parameters @xmath194 . (",
    "the remaining parameters @xmath195 are then essentially determined through the `` normalization '' conditions discussed earlier . ) in the analysis we have presented thus far , we have allowed @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath171 to vary , but we have taken @xmath30 and @xmath168  gev as fixed benchmarks . since there is nothing in the ddm framework which requires these particular values , it is reasonable to ask what new effects might emerge if these values are altered .    7.0 truein    the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 play independent but correlated roles : both appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : massspectrum ] ) and together they parametrize the density of states in the ddm ensemble .",
    "increasing @xmath22 or @xmath21 has the effect of increasing the masses of the heavier ddm constituents relative to the lighter ones , thereby potentially diminishing their effects on low - energy physics .",
    "indeed , for sufficiently large @xmath21 , our ddm ensemble essentially acts as a traditional single - particle dark sector as far as most low - energy effects are concerned .",
    "by contrast , decreasing @xmath22 or @xmath21 has the reverse effect .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath196 limit , the states in the ddm ensemble form a continuum , and in practice such `` continuum '' behavior can be expected whenever @xmath21 is smaller than the scale set by the energy resolution of the relevant cosmic - ray detectors .    in our analysis thus far , we were motivated to take because this is the value which arises in certain well - motivated realizations of ddm ensembles involving large extra spacetime dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , our choice of @xmath31  gev was made on purely aesthetic grounds , as a small value of this size ensures that a large portion of the ddm ensemble plays a role in contributing to the relevant cosmic - ray fluxes .",
    "it is therefore interesting to understand the extent to which our predictions remain valid even if @xmath21 exceeds this value .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltamplot ] , we show the fluxes which emerge from a variety of ddm ensembles corresponding to different values of @xmath21 , while the remaining ddm parameters are held fixed at values which ensure a successful fit to data for @xmath31  gev .   as we see from this figure , increasing",
    "the value of @xmath21 causes the resulting fluxes to increasingly deviate from the existing data , particularly at the highest energies for which such data is available .",
    "this is particularly dramatic for the positron - fraction data ; indeed , increasing the value of @xmath21 ultimately reintroduces the characteristic downturn that is normally associated with traditional single - component dark - matter candidates . as we see , it is only by taking @xmath21 sufficiently small that the predicted positron fraction can match all of the data .",
    "this is precisely the `` ddm limit '' in which a large portion of the ddm ensemble plays an active role in contributing to the cosmic - ray fluxes at these energies .",
    "this observation demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between obtaining a successful fit to the data and having a dark sector such as a ddm ensemble in which a relatively large number of dark - matter states actually contribute to the cosmic - ray fluxes at these energies .",
    "but what is particularly remarkable about the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltamplot ] is the existence of a second , independent correlation : a successful fit to the entirety of available data is also correlated with the absence of a sharp downturn in the positron fraction out to energies @xmath197  tev .",
    "indeed , setting @xmath21 to any value less than the maximum value that will fit the existing data causes the corresponding positron fraction to exhibit at most a gently declining plateau out to @xmath197  tev .   in an arbitrary hypothetical multi - component theory of dark matter ,",
    "this second correlation need not have existed , but its emergence in the ddm framework is ultimately a consequence of the tight internal scaling structure of the ddm ensemble .",
    "it is this `` rigidity '' of the ddm ensemble  , its inability to fit the existing data while simultaneously producing an immediate downturn in the positron fraction at higher energies  which is the underlying reason that the ddm framework yields such `` smoking gun '' predictions about the positron fraction at higher energies .",
    "( in this context we remark that although we have taken @xmath198  gev for the curves in fig .  [",

    "while these worries would certainly be valid for an arbitrary hypothetical multi - component theory of dark matter , the important point here is that our dark sector is not just a random collection of individual states with arbitrary , freely adjustable masses and decay widths . instead ,",

    "[ fig : varybackgroundsandfluxes ] , the effect of replacing the med propagation model with the min propagation model is quite dramatic and results in a near - total elimination of the allowed ddm parameter space , while replacement with the max propagation model does not dramatically alter the allowed region of ddm parameter space and merely changes the calculated quality of fit to data within this region .",
    "these results are relatively easy to understand . broadly speaking , the effect of propagation on the injected fluxes through the interstellar medium is to increase the contribution to @xmath203 at low @xmath117 from injected @xmath14 with an injection energy @xmath204 . moreover , this effect becomes increasingly pronounced at higher @xmath205 .",
    "the collective contribution to @xmath43 from the heavier constituents in the ddm ensemble is therefore greater at low @xmath117 for propagation models such the max model , in which the processing of the @xmath14 injection spectra by the interstellar medium is more pronounced .",
    "as we have seen , this contribution is ultimately responsible for the all - important softening of the @xmath43 flux spectra which renders these spectra compatible with the data .",
    "therefore , the increased processing of the injection spectrum by the interstellar medium in the max model relative to the med model can compensate to some degree for the hardening of the injection spectrum which results from an increase in @xmath171 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : deltamplot ] .",
    "by contrast , use of the min propagation model has the effect of minimizing the contributions to the low - energy @xmath14 fluxes from the heavier ddm ensemble components .",
    "the resulting near - total elimination of the allowed ddm parameter space therefore can be taken as yet another feature highlighting the critical role of the entire ddm ensemble ( and not just its lightest component ) in producing a successful fit to @xmath199 data .    the other lesson that can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : varybackgroundsandfluxes ] is that our results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of halo profile .",
    "this indicates that our results are indeed properties of the ddm framework rather than properties of the specific halo profile chosen .",
    "the primary reason for this halo - insensitivity is that the dominant contribution to @xmath1 and @xmath206 in the ddm framework is the result of dark - matter decay rather than dark - matter annihilation .",
    "the contribution to @xmath1 or @xmath206 from a decaying dark - matter particle @xmath64 is proportional to its density @xmath207 , whereas for an annihilating particle it is proportional to @xmath208 .",
    "these fluxes are consequently far less sensitive to the shape of the dark - matter halo in the former case than in the latter .",
    "likewise , the dominant constraints on decaying dark - matter models of the positron excess come from considerations which depend either very weakly ( or not at all ) on the shape of the galactic dark - matter halo , such as the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray flux and the properties of the cmb radiation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fanplotsminmax ] , we show the fluxes which result from the use of the min and max propagation models within the corresponding allowed parameter spaces shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varybackgroundsandfluxes ] . as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : varybackgroundsandfluxes ] , use of the min propagation model results in only a small surviving sliver of ddm parameter space ; this in turn leads to a fairly sharp set of flux predictions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fanplotsminmax ] . by contrast",
    ", use of the max propagation model leads to a set of possible fluxes in fig .  [",
    "fig : fanplotsminmax ] which are even somewhat broader in their allowed behaviors than those which appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : fanplot ] for the med propagation model . despite these differences ,",
    "however , we once again see that the primary prediction of the ddm framework  that the positron fraction will continue to exhibit a surplus out to the higher energies @xmath209  tev without exhibiting a sharp downturn  continues to hold in all cases .",
    "indeed , even the steepest allowed decline exhibited in the max case continues to be a relatively slow one in which the positron flux reaches its expected background value only at energies well beyond @xmath197  tev .",
    "we see , then , that the primary results we have presented in this paper  that decaying ddm ensembles can successfully reproduce both and fermi data and yield concrete predictions for the positron fraction at high energies  in most cases do not depend significantly on our choice of astrophysical approximations or computational tools . indeed , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , it is the relative softness of the @xmath43 spectra from an entire decaying ddm ensemble which underlies these phenomenological successes , and this is an inherent property of the ddm framework which transcends the particular calculational procedures and astrophysical parameters chosen . even in the most dramatic case in which we replace the med propagation model with the rather extreme min propagation model , the very small remaining region of ddm parameter space continues to exhibit the `` smoking gun '' feature in which the positron fraction remains above background out to higher energies beyond those currently probed . thus , while the specific quantitative results obtained using alternative approximations or computational tools may differ somewhat , this relative softness  which we have demonstrated contributes significantly to easing phenomenological tensions  is a real and direct consequence of the underlying particle physics of ddm ensembles .    finally , before concluding , we emphasize that the criterion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaconsistencycondit ] ) does not represent a constraint which our ddm framework must satisfy , but rather merely defines a phenomenologically interesting regime of parameter space within that framework .",
    "indeed , regions of parameter space in which this criterion is not satisfied can also in principle yield models which reproduce positron - fraction data and at the same time satisfy other constraints on dark - matter decays . in general ,",
    "such models lead to a more mundane set of predictions for the positron fraction at high energies , including the possibility of a relatively sharp downturn similar to that expected in traditional dark - matter models of the positron excess .",
    "thus , while the observation of a slowly falling or relatively level positron excess in future data would strongly favor a decaying ddm ensemble over other possible dark - matter interpretations , the non - observation of such a signal would not , in and of itself , rule out a ddm ensemble as an explanation of that excess .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the implications of cosmic - ray data  and in particular , the recent measurement of the positron fraction  for models constructed within the dynamical dark matter ( ddm ) framework . because the ddm framework generally includes dark - matter particles with lifetimes near the current age of the universe",
    ", present - day cosmic - ray data can be expected to have particular relevance for ddm .",
    "our primary results can be summarized as follows :    * first , we have shown that ddm ensembles provide a viable dark - matter explanation of the existing positron excess .",
    "this is true even when the relevant astrophysical and cosmological constraints are taken into account . indeed , as we have seen , the partitioning of the dark - matter abundance @xmath33 across an entire ensemble of dark - sector fields obeying certain scaling relations provides a natural and well - motivated method of softening the @xmath14 injection spectrum and reproducing the existing data .",
    "moreover , for a ddm ensemble whose constituents decay primarily to @xmath147 , we have found that this softening alone is sufficient to obtain consistency with the positron fraction observed by and the combined @xmath14 flux observed by fermi . *",
    "second , we have shown that those ddm scenarios which successfully reproduce the observed positron excess generically predict that the positron fraction either levels off or falls gradually at higher energies beyond those currently probed .",
    "by contrast , conventional dark - matter scenarios for explaining the positron excess generically predict a very different behavior : an abrupt downturn in the positron fraction at higher energies .",
    "thus , if we attribute the positron excess to dark - matter physics , we may interpret a relatively flat positron excess curve as a `` smoking gun '' of the ddm framework .",
    "* finally , we note that in order to reproduce the positron - fraction curve observed by pamela and , a traditional dark - matter candidate typically must be quite heavy , with a mass @xmath186  tev .",
    "by contrast , we have shown that those ddm ensembles which accurately reproduce the observed positron - fraction curve generically tend to include large numbers of lighter constituent particles @xmath18 , with masses in the range @xmath210 .",
    "the presence of such lighter particles playing an active role in the dark sector opens up a broader variety of possibilities for detection using other , complementary probes of the dark sector  including colliders , direct - detection experiments , _",
    "etc_.    moreover , as we have shown in sect .  [ sec : varyinginputs ] , these results are largely independent of a variety of input assumptions associated with the nature of our ddm ensemble or the modelling of the external astrophysical environment .    despite these results , it is important to stress that our analysis in this paper has been fundamentally predicated on an underlying dark - matter interpretation of the positron excess",
    ". however , there do exist alternative explanations of these cosmic - ray anomalies .",
    "indeed , as has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , a contribution to @xmath1 and @xmath206 from a population of nearby pulsars may provide an alternative explanation for the positron excess reported by pamela , fermi , and other cosmic - ray experiments .",
    "this explanation is a compelling one because it offers an origin for this excess in terms of standard astrophysical processes rather than new physics .",
    "moreover , the pulsar explanation is also of particular interest in relation to the cosmic - ray phenomenology of ddm ensembles . indeed , much like the net contribution from a ddm ensemble , the net contribution to @xmath1 and @xmath206 from a population of nearby pulsars represents the sum over a large number of individual contributions .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that many of the same characteristic features which arise in the @xmath1 and @xmath206 spectra associated with ddm ensembles should also appear within the range of possible spectra associated with specific pulsar populations .",
    "indeed , the shape of the overall positron - fraction curve associated with a collection of pulsars may be difficult to distinguish from that associated with a ddm ensemble .",
    "however , in general one can measure more than the mere _ shape _ of such a differential flux ; one can also study the _ directionality _ associated with its individual angular contributions .",
    "directionality is especially important in this situation because it provides a critical method of distinguishing the case of a ddm ensemble from that of a population of pulsars . in the pulsar case ,",
    "an anisotropy is expected in the signal contributions as a function of energy due to the differing positions of the individual contributing pulsars .",
    "in fact , if a single nearby pulsar ( or a small number thereof ) is essentially responsible for the observed positron excess , this anisotropy should be observable over a wide range of energies @xmath117 at the cherenkov telescope array ( cta )  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , it is reasonable to imagine that the constituent particles within a ddm ensemble are distributed in roughly the same manner throughout the galactic halo , and thus no significant flux anisotropy is to be expected ( other than a slight overall flux enhancement in the direction of the galactic center , an enhancement which is unlikely to be detected at future experiments ) .    provided that the contributions of individual pulsars can be resolved , we conclude that forthcoming data on the anisotropy of the observed positron flux may play an important role in differentiating between a collection of local pulsars and a ddm ensemble as explanations for the observed positron excess .",
    "however , we note that the propagation of cosmic rays in the local environment is very complicated , and it may ultimately be very difficult to draw any firm conclusions in the case that no anistropy is ultimately detected . these issues are discussed more fully in ref .",
    "likewise , we also note that there also exist even more prosaic models that can potentially explain the positron excess .",
    "these include , for example , models  @xcite in which the excess positrons are generated as secondary products of hadronic interactions inside natural cosmic - ray sources such as supernova remnants , and are thus naturally accelerated in a way that endows them with a relatively flat spectrum .",
    "measurements of the secondary nuclei produced by cosmic - ray spallation could potentially be used in order to discriminate between these possibilities  @xcite .",

    "<S> the experiment has recently released data which confirms a rise in the cosmic - ray positron fraction as a function of energy up to approximately @xmath0  gev .   over the past decade , attempts to interpret this positron excess in terms of dark - matter decays have become increasingly complex and have led to a number of general expectations about the decaying dark - matter particles : such particles can not undergo simple two - body decays to leptons , for example , and they must have rather heavy tev - scale masses . in this paper , by contrast , we show that dynamical dark matter ( ddm ) can not only match existing data on the positron excess , but also accomplish this feat with significantly lighter dark - matter constituents undergoing simple two - body decays to leptons . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate that this can be done without running afoul of numerous other competing constraints from fermi and planck on decaying dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that the dynamical dark matter framework makes a fairly robust prediction that the positron fraction should level off and then remain roughly constant out to approximately 1  tev , without experiencing any sharp downturns . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> if we interpret the positron excess in terms of decaying dark matter , we find that the existence of a plateau in the positron fraction at energies less than 1  tev may be taken as a `` smoking gun '' of dynamical dark matter .    .7ex    </S>",
