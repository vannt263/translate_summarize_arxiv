    "<S> a scaling analysis is presented of the statistics of long dna confined in nanochannels and nanoslits . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that there are several regimes in between the de gennes and odijk limits introduced long ago . </S>",
    "<S> the dna chain folds back on itself giving rise to a global persistence length which may be very large owing to entropic deflection . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is an orientational excluded - volume effect between the dna segments imposed solely by the nanoconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> these two effects cause the chain statistics to be intricate leading to nontrivial power laws for the chain extension in the intermediate regimes . </S>",
    "<S> it is stressed that dna confinement within nanochannels differs from that in nanoslits because the respective orientational excluded - volume effects are not the same .    * </S>",
    "<S> electronic address : odijktcf@wanadoo.nl    a perusal of the rapidly developing literature on nanoconfined dna shows that its behavior is more complex than anticipated ( see e.g. teg , rec , rei1,fan , man , bal1,ste , kim , hsi , tan , bal2,jo , rei2,kri , cro , bon , kri2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that more regimes are needed besides those originally described by daoud and de gennes @xcite and odijk @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nanoconfinement of a semiflexible chain specifically introduces subtleties in the chain statistics which i address here within a scaling analysis . </S>",
    "<S> a complete theory would involve solving a fokker - planck equation subject to the boundary conditions arising from nanoconfinement @xcite . nevertheless , backfolding or hairpin formation </S>",
    "<S> may be addressed in a mechanical approximation @xcite though entropic depletion of the chain near a wall still needs to be resolved quantitatively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerical investigations of nanoconfined stiff chains interacting via excluded - volume interactions have appeared recently @xcite but in the limit of ground - state dominance without accounting for hairpin formation .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider a very long double - stranded dna chain confined in a nanochannel of square cross section whose side @xmath0 is smaller than the persistence length @xmath1 so that we are in the odijk regime @xmath2 . thus the chain may be conveniently viewed as a sequence of deflection segments of typical length @xcite    @xmath3    the orientational fluctuations with respect to the channel center axis are given by the mean - square average    @xmath4    it is important to note that the coefficient @xmath5 here is quite small as has been determined numerically @xcite and estimated analytically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inevitably , a long chain must bear thermally activated hairpins leading to a global persistence length @xmath6 as shown in fig 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the entropic depletion caused by the nanowalls forces the hairpin bends to be tightened up so that @xmath6 is often considerably larger than the persistence length @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> expressions for @xmath6 are presented in appendix i.    . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between hairpins is typically @xmath6.[fig1 ] ]    in view of the backfolding , segments of the dna interact with each other via the excluded - volume effect . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the charges borne by the dna backbone , one introduces an effective diameter @xmath7 rather than a bare diameter @xcite ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the interaction were purely isotropic , the excluded volume between a pair of deflection segments would scale as @xcite    @xmath9    but the segments are aligned ( see eq ( [ vgl2 ] ) ) so that the effective excluded volume becomes @xcite    @xmath10    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the angle between two deflection rodlets ( for a computation of the orientational factor , see appendix ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is stressed that we are in the sparse limit @xmath13 : the orientational order is imposed solely by the walls of the nanochannel and independent of the density of dna segments .    </S>",
    "<S> the dna chain of length @xmath14 may now be viewed as a one dimensional walk consisting of @xmath15 statistical segments . </S>",
    "<S> it is partly self avoiding in the sense that the volume exclusion between the deflection rodlets is three - dimensional . employing a mean - field argument of the flory type which is excellent in one dimension @xcite , i write the free energy of the confined chain as    @xmath16    here , t is the temperature and @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in eq ( [ vgl6 ] ) is the ideal free energy needed to extend the dna chain to root - mean - square extension @xmath18 and the second term arises from the interaction of @xmath19 deflection segments in a volume @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> minimization of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath18 yields    @xmath22    @xmath23    eqs ( [ vgl6 ] ) and ( [ vgl7 ] ) are reminiscent of those occurring in the theory of grafted polymers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one is now naturally led to introduce the following regimes .      </S>",
    "<S> from eq ( [ vgl7 ] ) we discern that the chain must be almost fully aligned @xmath25 apart from minor fluctuations given by eq ( [ vgl2 ] ) .      </S>",
    "<S> the excluded - volume term in eq ( [ vgl6 ] ) is analogous to the excluded - volume parameter @xmath28 introduced in the two - parameter theory of the expansion of flexible polymer chains @xcite    @xmath29    the excluded - volume effect is fully exerted in the limit @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a crossover to the case of weakly interacting segments at @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the contour length must be larger than @xmath32 if eq ( [ vgl7 ] ) is to remain valid .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33      in this case the excluded - volume effect is weak @xmath35 so the behavior of the dna is effectively that of an ideal chain as long as @xmath36    @xmath37    i now investigate what happens as the nanochannel is widened . </S>",
    "<S> the global persistence length rapidly approaches the usual persistence length ( see eq ( [ vgl25 ] ) in appendix i ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , one may introduce a crossover    @xmath38    at @xmath39 which signals the breakdown of the odijk regime ( the numerical coefficient @xmath40 is larger than unity ) . </S>",
    "<S> concomitantly , the channel is no longer narrow enough to impose orientational order on the dna : @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we now enter the next regime upon increasing @xmath0 .      </S>",
    "<S> i now express the total free energy of the chain as in eq ( [ vgl6 ] ) but with @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to    @xmath45    @xmath46    it is again possible to demarcate one subregime in which the chain expansion is dominated by the excluded - volume effect from another subregime where the chain is ideal more or less . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover in the contour length is given by    @xmath47    superficially , it may appear as if eq ( [ vgl13 ] ) conforms to a daoud - de gennes type of theory @xcite but this is not the case for @xmath48 ( see eq ( [ vgl16 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate regime one has to introduce here is caused by the fact that the dna segments are slender @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the chain may be viewed as a sequence of anisometric blobs , each of length @xmath50 and diameter @xmath0 .      </S>",
    "<S> daoud and de gennes argued that a flexible polymer confined in a capillary piles up as a sequence of blobs , each blob being viewed as a flory chain of @xmath52 segments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the blobs do not interpenetrate owing to the excluded - volume repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> the supposition is that @xmath30 within a blob . in the problem at hand </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath53 segments of length @xmath1 interacting by an excluded volume @xmath54 yielding an excluded - volume parameter @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> if the flory expansion is to be valid within a blob of radius @xmath0 , we require @xmath56 . in other words , upon eliminating @xmath53 we must have @xmath57 . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , if the blob picture is to be valid , one has to impose @xmath58 implying that @xmath59 is expressed by    @xmath60    note that eq ( [ vgl13 ] ) remains valid as can be verified in a blob analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however , the difference between regimes 3 and 4 may show up in subtle measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> let us next turn to nanoslits of rectangular cross section @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) . in many respects , </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning is now the same as that presented above so the analysis will be brief . </S>",
    "<S> i first focus on thin slits @xmath63 in which the dna chain is effectively one dimensional .    </S>",
    "<S> the analogue of eq ( [ vgl6 ] ) is now    @xmath64    the orientational factor @xmath65 within e then has a rather subtle dependence on a and d ( see appendix ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the deflection length is still given by eq ( [ vgl1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> upon minimizing eq ( [ vgl17 ] ) , we get    @xmath66    @xmath67    the second equality in the expression for @xmath68 pertains to the limit @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> it is again possible to introduce crossovers @xmath70at @xmath71 and @xmath72 and so forth .    if one next increases the width @xmath73 , the global persistence length given by eqs ( [ vgl24 ] ) and ( [ vgl27 ] ) decreases rapidly to the value @xmath1 at @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a numerical constant larger than unity . at the same time the chain loses its local anisotropy : @xmath76 ( see eq ( [ vgl31 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that the chain remains confined to a thin slab @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> eq ( [ vgl17 ] ) with @xmath44 still holds though @xmath68 in eq ( [ vgl18 ] ) is replaced by    @xmath78    ultimately , if we keep on increasing @xmath73 , we attain the case where the chain may be viewed as a two - dimensional pancake @xmath79 . instead of eq ( [ vgl17 ] ) , we have    @xmath80    minimization of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath18 yields    @xmath81    one recognizes the usual @xmath82 power law applicable to the excluded - volume effect in two dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the excluded - volume parameter    @xmath83    has to be greater than unity if eq ( [ vgl23 ] ) is to be valid otherwise @xmath84    the analysis given above has the drawback that the numerical coefficients are unknown and may deviate substantially from unity . </S>",
    "<S> this is exemplified in the application of eqs ( [ vgl8 ] ) and ( [ vgl10 ] ) to the recent measurements on @xmath85-phage dna extended within nanochannels of essentially square cross - sections @xcite . for instance , in the widest channel of width @xmath86 nm , the dimensionless parameter @xmath87 is about @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath90 m which would lead to a crossover length @xmath91 of about @xmath92 @xmath90 m ( i have estimated @xmath7 to be 4.6 nm on the basis of the concentration of buffer used by reisner et al ) . </S>",
    "<S> but we know that the coefficients in eq ( [ vgl2 ] ) and ( [ vgl3 ] ) are somewhat smaller than unity ( see also ref @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is a persistent finite size effect for semiflexible chains which significantly suppresses the excluded - volume interaction @xcite . on the whole </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath32 could be an order of magnitude larger so that the dna of contour length @xmath93 @xmath90 m would only be slightly perturbed by excluded volume . </S>",
    "<S> this would explain why the hairpin theory for the phantom worm @xcite agrees well with the dna extensions @xcite . in a similar vein , krishnan and petrov @xcite </S>",
    "<S> use the same theory to explain the ionic - strength dependence of the dna elongation measured in some detail by reisner et al @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , the strong dependence on salt then arises from the exponential dependence of @xmath6 on the persistence length @xmath1 ( see eq ( vgl25 ) ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter quantity was dealt with on an empirical level by using the values from optical tweezer experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , reisner et al rei2 themselves argue that a blob picture could be valid on the basis of assuming @xmath94 ( this would be regime 3 defined above ) . </S>",
    "<S> a reassessment of these experiments is warranted to reconcile the apparently opposing points of view .    as i argued above </S>",
    "<S> , the degree of orientational order depends on whether the cross section of the channel in which the dna is confined is square , rectangular or slitlike of infinite extent . in the case of the @xmath95 nm@xmath96 nanoslits used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 12 , the quantity @xmath97 from eq ( [ vgl19 ] ) turns out to be very large because the ionic strength is quite low ( @xmath98 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dna is predicted to be fully extended even in 100 @xmath90 m long slits as is indeed the case . </S>",
    "<S> bonthuis at al @xcite have studied the radius of gyration of dna in @xmath99 slits as a function of height @xmath0 right into the odijk regime . </S>",
    "<S> there is only one abrupt transition at @xmath100 i.e. there are no intermediate regimes in agreement with the analysis presented here </S>",
    "<S> .    in summary , a scaling analysis of nanoconfined dna has been presented based on orientational order imposed by the channel walls and a global persistence length greatly enhanced by entropic depletion . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , more experiments are needed to delineate the regimes proposed here . </S>"
