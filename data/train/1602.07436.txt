    "we have called this phenomenon the azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri , see @xcite ) ; following theoretical suggestions by @xcite , this mode has by now been observed in a laboratory experiment @xcite .",
    "this combination of a magnetic field @xmath13 and a rotation profile @xmath14 ( potential flow ) exactly at the rayleigh limit is an example of a particular class of basic states defined by @xcite to consist of @xmath15 or more generally , @xmath16 that is , the radial profiles of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are required to be the same , but there may be a constant of proportionality between the two , denoted as the magnetic mach number @xmath19 , the ratio of the fluid velocity @xmath17 to the  velocity @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "however , these states can be destabilized if at least one of the molecular diffusivities @xmath26 ( kinematic viscosity ) or @xmath27 ( magnetic diffusivity ) is non - zero .",
    "we argued that the class of states which fulfill the condition ( [ chandra2 ] ) yield a set of diffusive instabilities with several properties in common @xcite .",
    "while @xcite concentrated on linear results for the modes @xmath28 , this study extends this work towards higher @xmath5 and concentrates especially on nonlinear effects in the saturated state .    as a reminder , for the azimuthal modes @xmath3 the marginal stability curves in the @xmath29-@xmath30 plane converge for small magnetic prandtl numbers @xmath31 as a consequence , for sufficiently small @xmath2 instability only exists for @xmath32 , that is , for slow rotation . rapidly rotating flows with @xmath33",

    ", the inclusion of the radiative viscosity leads to @xmath35 magnetic prandtl numbers @xcite .",
    "as many of these magnetized cosmical objects combine large magnetic mach numbers with small magnetic prandtl numbers , the astrophysical relevance of these chandrasekhar states , including amri , might seem to be limited . however , these results to date considered only azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath3 .",
    "we will see in this work that @xmath4 modes may behave quite differently , with sufficiently flat profiles allowing instability for large @xmath19 even for small @xmath2 , and hence yielding astrophysically relevant results after all .    finally , for the sake of completeness , let us return briefly to axisymmetric modes , and demonstrate that any states satisfying ( [ chandra2 ] ) are always stable to such @xmath36 modes , provided only that the rotation rate does not increase outward .",

    "the reason for the particular choice @xmath91 is that this represents the so - called quasi - keplerian value where @xmath94 , although according to ( [ basic ] ) the profile is not exactly keplerian , but merely has the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 that fit a keplerian ratio at the endpoints .",

    "much closer comes a scaling @xmath163 that is found in forced turbulence @xcite or in spectra of not yet truly turbulent flows @xcite . because the amri power spectra for low @xmath74 also have a tendency towards @xmath163 , this might be a sign of very weak turbulence .    on the other hand , as the energy source in this case is only from the underlying current rather than any differential rotation , one might question whether @xmath29 and/or @xmath74 are the relevant measures at all , or whether @xmath30 might not be the more appropriate measure in determining the shape of the spectrum for the rigidly rotating pinch .",
    "the largest numerically accessible hartmann number is @xmath164 , and still showed no deviation from this @xmath163 scaling .     for @xmath165 and @xmath139 for various @xmath2.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]",
    "the spectra in the axial direction have a somewhat different shape compared with the azimuthal direction .",
    "the basic wavenumber at the onset of instability is @xmath166 , corresponding to a round cross section of the patterns .",
    "a small increase in the reynolds number extends this range to @xmath167 . for turbulence at even higher reynolds numbers ,",
    "these large scales remain as a plateau for @xmath168 , and the part of the spectra for intermediate @xmath6 shows a similar behavior as the @xmath5 spectra with no significant plateau ( fig . [ fig_spec_km_ray ] ) .",
    "the closest slope is again the ik profile with @xmath169 .     and @xmath6 wavenumbers for @xmath170.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]     and @xmath6 wavenumbers for @xmath171.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    one aspect where the @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra clearly differ is for large values . as previously noted , for large @xmath5 the spectra drop off quite strongly , due to the smoothing and hence damping effect of the differential rotation",
    "such a mechanism does not exist in the axial direction , and larger @xmath6 are correspondingly more strongly excited than large @xmath5 . the greater the shear , the greater the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in this regard . for @xmath172",
    "the largest @xmath6 are stronger by one order of magnitude for the quasi - keplerian flow , and two orders of magnitude for the steeper potential flow ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_km_ray ] and [ fig_spec_km_kep ] ) . for the very large @xmath74 of real astrophysical objects",
    ", this anisotropy between different directions might be even more strongly developed .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic taylor - couette flows have been investigated for many decades @xcite .",
    "one possibility that is always stable for ideal flows is if the imposed field is purely azimuthal , and has the same radial profile as the imposed velocity profile @xcite .",
    "however , as demonstrated by @xcite , such chandrasekhar states can become unstable if at least one of the diffusivities is non - zero .",
    "if viscosity and magnetic resistivity are _ both _ non - zero , the @xmath3 marginal instability curves in the @xmath30-@xmath29 plane become independent of magnetic prandtl number in the limit @xmath153 . from the definition ( [ mm ] ) , there will then always exist some ( small ) value of @xmath2 below which _ all _ eigenvalues of the linear perturbation equations yield @xmath32 .",
    "given that many cosmical objects such as accretion disks , stars and compact objects often combine small @xmath2 and large @xmath19 , the stability of these chandrasekhar states might therefore seem to be a purely academic exercise .",
    "this is especially the case as for the standard amri at least , with @xmath89 and @xmath13 , the @xmath4 modes exhibit exactly the same scaling with @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , for the pure ti , with @xmath173 and @xmath174 , only the @xmath3 mode is unstable , and it also scales with @xmath30 and @xmath29 for small @xmath2 .",
    "however , as we demonstrated in this work , for rotation laws _ between _ @xmath89 and @xmath173 ( and corresponding @xmath175 ) , the @xmath4 modes behave differently , for small @xmath2 scaling instead with @xmath107 and @xmath74 . from the basic relationship @xmath176 , together with the upward - sloping shape of the critical stability curve @xmath177 , it then follows that @xmath33 can always be achieved , even in the limit @xmath106 .",
    "this finding is one of the main conclusions of this work , and suggests that only the @xmath4 modes are relevant for the majority of astrophysical applications .",
    "the magnetic and kinetic energies of mhd instabilities are often considered as approximately the same order when @xmath178 . for smaller @xmath2 the magnetic energy",
    "is assumed to be smaller than the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "this is indeed true for these chandrasekhar states .",
    "the top panels of figs .",
    "[ 25d ] ( amri ) and [ 100b ] ( ti ) show the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) for the two limiting examples for various @xmath2 . in both cases",
    "the magnetic and kinetic energies are indeed equipartitioned for @xmath178 , and @xmath179 for smaller @xmath2 . for the curves with fixed @xmath30 and @xmath29 a clear trend exists of the critical @xmath2 at the crossing points at the axis @xmath159 . for a single curve for the pair @xmath180 $ ] the ratio scales as @xmath181 , but the curves with other parameter combinations are not identical but rather parallel .    as this conclusion holds for both an example with differential rotation ( amri ) and another one with rigid rotation ( ti ) , the induction by the background flow is obviously not so important .",
    "moreover it is not @xmath2 that defines the value of @xmath140 .",
    "the relevant parameter is the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "this is true not only for the limits @xmath86 and @xmath90 , but also for all @xmath102 in between .    for non - magnetic taylor - couette flows @xcite simulated turbulent solutions with @xmath85 for flows with resting outer cylinder .",
    "the critical reynolds number for @xmath36 is 68 , for @xmath3 it is 75 , and for @xmath118 it is 127 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath182 the flow is not yet turbulent as no high frequencies appear . for @xmath183 , 5000 and 8000 temporal power spectra of the kolmogorov - type develop , which only differ slightly for high frequencies .",
    "the higher the reynolds number the higher frequencies appear as more and more nonaxisymmetric modes become unstable . a similar behavior can be observed for the amri @xmath5 spectra of fig .",
    "[ spec25 ] .",
    "the bottom panel displays spectra of the magnetic energy for reynolds numbers from @xmath184 ( blue line ) to @xmath185 ( black line ) .",
    "the latter line represents the occurrence of higher frequencies .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ spec25 ] demonstrates the influence of the magnetic prandtl number for given hartmann and reynolds numbers , in comparison to the results of fig .",
    "the majority of the modes are unstable for @xmath115 , while for smaller @xmath2 ( or more general @xmath74 ) the higher modes become more and more stable so that the steepest curve in fig .",
    "[ spec25 ] ( top ) results for the smallest @xmath2 .",
    "the opposite is true for the azimuthal power spectrum of the rigidly - rotating pinch .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ spec100 ] the curve for @xmath115 is the steepest . here",
    "only the mode with @xmath3 is unstable , with the strongest rotational suppression for @xmath115 ( see fig .",
    "[ 100a ] ) .",
    "even the power spectrum of the rigidly - rotating pinch gives an indication about the double - diffusive character of the nonaxisymmetric magnetic kink - type instability , as analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the scaling behavior of the intermediate range of both wavenumbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 remains unclear in the sense that no significant plateau develops .",
    "the closest scaling exponent will be @xmath157 and @xmath169 of a iroshnikov - kraichnan spectrum .",
    "@xmath186 scaling is not observed .    in comparison to the azimuthal spectra ,",
    "the axial spectra show a different distribution .",
    "first of all there exists a large - scale plateau around the marginal unstable wavenumber @xmath187 .",
    "the largest wavenumbers are also much more strongly excited .",
    "the reason is the smoothing action of differential rotation , which tends to destroy high wavenumbers and leads to a steeper slope in the tails of the @xmath5 spectra compared with the @xmath6 spectra .",
    "this anisotropy should be even more strongly pronounced for the very large @xmath74 of real astrophysical objects .",
