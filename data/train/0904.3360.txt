    "discovery and establishment of neutrino mass and the lepton flavor mixing @xcite by the atmospheric , the solar , and the reactor experiments @xcite triggers a tantalizing question of whether neutrinos have interactions outside the standard model of particle physics .",
    "in fact , the possibility has been extensively discussed starting from the early works in @xcite and in conjunction with expectation of new physics at tev energy scale @xcite .    to our current understanding ,",
    "one of the most significant features of fundamental matter is the quark - lepton parallelism .",
    "then , the crucial question is to what extent it prevails and in what respect it fails @xcite .",
    "for example , quark and lepton flavor mixing is described by the ckm @xcite and the mns @xcite matrices , respectively , similar in structure but with very different values of the mixing angles @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the quark sector the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) theory @xcite for cp violation works perfectly to the accuracy of the experiments achieved to date @xcite .",
    "we still do not know if a natural extension of the km theory to the lepton sector provides a correct description of nature  @xcite .    in the presence of non - standard interactions ( nsi ) of neutrinos , however , the task of exploring lepton cp violation is inevitably confused or enriched by the coexistence of possible another source of cp violation induced by nsi @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the problem of how to resolve the confusion caused by the two sources of cp violation in the context of measurement of the lepton mixing parameters in neutrino factory experiments  @xcite .",
    "of course , discovery of nsi will open an entirely new window to physics beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we aim at achieving the two goals : illuminating how to resolve the confusion between the standard interaction ( si ) and the nsi parameters , and exploring the discovery potential of nsi . in this paper , we mean by si parameters @xmath11 and @xmath0 assuming that the other standard lepton mixing parameters are determined to reasonable accuracies .",
    "the problem of confusion between the si and the nsi parameters has been raised in the form of @xmath13nsi confusion in @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that it can be resolved by a two - detector setting , one at baseline @xmath5 km and the other at @xmath6 km , in neutrino factory experiments , enjoying an intense neutrino beam from a muon storage ring . in a natural continuation of the work",
    ", we discuss the problem of two - phase confusion in this paper by extending our treatment to allow the nsi elements @xmath14 ( for definition , see sec .",
    "[ sec : nsifeatures ] ) to have phases . for",
    "a related work on the same subject see @xcite .",
    "the similar question of distinguishing two kind of cp violation in the context of `` unitarity violation '' approach @xcite has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "one of the most important questions on nsi is how large their effects are . given the extreme success of the standard model at low energies the natural framework to address the question is via higher dimensional operators @xcite . assuming the new physics scale of @xmath151 tev , it may be @xmath16 and @xmath17 for dimension six and eight operators , respectively .",
    "possible forms of theses operators are further narrowed down by the severe constraints on four charged lepton processes  @xcite , the @xmath18 partners of the neutrino interactions on leptons , the problem raised in @xcite . in view of the fact that the operators which are free from the four lepton counterpart are very limited @xcite , it may be the right attitude to anticipate and cover a wide range of magnitudes @xmath19 ( or less if possible ) as our target for hunting the nsi effects .",
    "for this reason , we try to cover the region down to @xmath20 in our analysis in this paper .",
    "the constraints on magnitude of nsi on neutrinos has been investigated @xcite , and the authors of @xcite made major advances in understanding the loop constraints .",
    "as is well known , the effects of nsi exist not only in propagation in matter but also in production and detection processes of neutrinos @xcite . in this paper , however , we only deal with the effect of nsi in neutrino propagation in matter .",
    "the reason for this limitation is mainly technical ; the features of neutrino flavor transformation are sufficiently complicated so that it deserves separate treatment . for the same reason , we restrict ourselves to systems with a single nsi element , either @xmath21 or @xmath2 , at one time .",
    "thanks to these limitations , we can have a transparent view of the parameter degeneracy  @xcite in systems with nsi  @xcite in its limited aspect that can be seen more clearly under the simplified setting . in this paper , we will try to give a complete understanding of the characteristic features of the system , not just showing the sensitivity contours .",
    "in particular , we will clarify the reasons why the sensitivities are so different between the systems with @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "taking @xmath22 as the target region , it is unlikely that reactor @xcite or superbeam @xcite experiments are powerful enough to have significant discovery potential for nsi .",
    "thus , we are left with either the neutrino factory @xcite or the beta beam @xcite as the possible technologies within our current knowledge .",
    "in fact , there exist a number of articles which are devoted to discuss the capabilities of discovering or constraining nsi in a neutrino factory experiment , for instance , see ref .",
    "because of the clean event reconstruction capability , we focus on the appearance channels @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the so called golden channels for the neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "we assume , following @xcite , a high energy muon beam of @xmath25 gev and two magnetized iron detectors at @xmath5 and 7000 km .",
    "notice that in the @xmath26-induced appearance channels , this or @xmath27 , the only relevant nsi elements are either @xmath3 or @xmath2 as shown in a perturbative framework in @xcite , which is nothing but the natural extension of the one developed in  @xcite .",
    "of course , it is important to place constraints on nsi from all possible available means .",
    "in fact , the bounds ( to be ) placed on nsi have been discussed in the context of accelerator neutrinos  @xcite ( excluding the neutrino factory ) , atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite , reactor or spallation beam neutrinos @xcite , solar neutrinos @xcite , as well as of astrophysical neutrinos @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation in the presence of nsi is a highly nontrivial problem .",
    "we try to give an introductory discussions on it in the light of some recent progresses .",
    "we consider nsi involving neutrinos of the type @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fermi constant , @xmath30 stands for the index running over fermion species in the earth , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 stands for a projection operator which is either @xmath33 or @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    to summarize its effects on neutrino propagation it is customary to introduce the effective @xmath37 parameters , which are defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) denotes the @xmath30-type fermion ( electron ) number density along the neutrino trajectory in the earth . using such @xmath37 parameters the evolution equation of neutrinos in the flavor basis",

    ": we note that since our discussion in this paper ignores effects of nsi in production and detection processes of neutrinos , the results here must be interpreted with care . yet ,",
    "the system is complicated enough so that the analysis of nsi effects in neutrino propagation itself seems to be a meaningful step .",
    "we also note that since we concentrate on nsi effects in neutrino propagation in matter only the vector type interactions can be probed .",
    "moreover , the types of nsi that can be studied may be limited to a sub class of generic nsi @xcite .",
    "we focus on @xmath23 and @xmath48 appearance channels to analyze effects of nsi , anticipating intense @xmath26 and @xmath49 beam from either a neutrino factory or beta beam .",
    "all the quantitative analyses will be done assuming muon storage ring and magnetized iron detectors with muon charge identification capability . for simplicity",
    ", we do not consider disappearance channels in this paper as we believe that the inclusion of them would not modify substantially our results .",
    "for qualitative understanding of various features of the analysis we use the oscillation probability derived in @xmath50 perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 is small as it is natural for the neutrino factory setting , though the current bound is still rather mild @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "@xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are regarded as small expansion parameters of the same order , while @xmath53 is regarded as of order unity .",
    "it is shown that to second order in @xmath50 the relevant nsi elements are only @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the @xmath56 channel ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "then , the oscillation probability in the @xmath57 channel can be written in the form of an absolute square as @xcite @xmath58   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{20 mm }   - { c_{23}}{s_{23}}\\varepsilon_{e\\tau }   \\left [ \\sin \\left ( \\frac{al}{4e } \\right ) e^{-i \\delta_{31 } } -   \\biggl ( \\frac{a}{{\\delta m_{31}^2}-a}\\biggr ) \\sin \\left ( \\frac{{\\delta m_{31}^2}-a}{4e}l \\right ) \\right ] \\biggr |^2 ,   \\label{pemu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .    as we will learn in the next subsection",
    ", the system with @xmath54 and @xmath55 is too complicated to do a full analysis , having six unknown parameters including three cp violating phases . in this paper , therefore , we work on systems with only a single type of nsi , @xmath54 or @xmath55 , as a step to understand the features of neutrino oscillations with nsi .",
    "the expression of the oscillation probability in ( [ pemu ] ) illuminates a notable difference between the systems with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "namely , the sensitivity to @xmath54 is generally better than that to @xmath55 because the two kinematic factors in the square bracket multiplied by the latter ( former ) tend to cancel ( add up ) .",
    "unfortunately , the reduced system with a single type of @xmath37 is still quite complicated .",
    "therefore , we try to understand the characteristic features of neutrino oscillations with @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) in this subsection .",
    "what makes this system so complicated is the presence of two cp violating phases , the lepton km phase @xcite in the mns matrix @xcite , and the phase @xmath64 of the nsi element @xmath65 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "an appropriate tool to illuminate the properties of neutrino oscillation with emphasis on the role played by phases is the bi - probability plot in @xmath66 ( for short @xmath67 ) space proposed in @xcite .",

    "<S> in neutrino oscillation with non - standard interactions ( nsi ) the system is enriched with cp violation caused by phases due to nsi in addition to the standard lepton kobayashi - maskawa phase @xmath0 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to disentangle the two cp violating effects by measurement of muon neutrino appearance by a near - far two detector setting in neutrino factory experiments . </S>",

    "<S> they include synergy between the near and the far detectors , the characteristic differences between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems , and in particular , the parameter degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use a concrete setting with the muon energy of 50 gev and magnetized iron detectors at two baselines , one at @xmath5 km and the other at @xmath6 km , each having a fiducial mass of 50 kton to study the discovery potential of nsi and its cp violation effects . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , by assuming @xmath7 useful muon decays for both polarities , that one can identify non - standard cp violation down to @xmath8 , and @xmath9 at 3@xmath10 cl for @xmath11 down to @xmath12 in most of the region of @xmath0 . the impact of the existence of nsi on the measurement of @xmath0 and the mass hierarchy is also worked out .    </S>",
