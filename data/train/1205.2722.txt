    "half - metals are among the most studied magnetic materials due to their potential application in spintronic devices.@xcite these unusual materials present metallic properties for one spin - direction while they behave like semiconductors for the other spin - direction eventually leading to 100%  spin - polarization at the fermi level.@xcite this peculiar property is exhibited by several transition - metal alloys but lately half - metallic ferromagnetism has been predicted for several alloys which do not include transition - metal atoms .",
    "such alloys are widely known in literature with various names like @xmath1 magnets , @xmath2-ferromagnets or sp - electron ferromagnets.@xcite these compounds have the advantage of being energy - efficient for applications since they create weak external magnetic fields and thus lead to minimal energy losses .",
    "there are several ways to create sp - electron ferromagnets and an extensive review is given in ref . .",
    "one of the most promising routes to half - metallic @xmath3-electron ferromagnets is the growth of i / ii - iv / v nanostructures in metastable lattice structures similar to the case of transition - metal pnictides and chalcogenides in the metastable zincblende structure.@xcite several studies to this research direction have appeared following the pioneering papers published by geshi et al@xcite and kusakabe et al@xcite who have shown using first - principles calculations that cap , caas and casb alloys present half - metallic ferromagnetism when grown in the zincblende structure .",
    "moreover they have shown that the gap appears due to a p - d hybridization mechanism which is similar as we will discuss in the next paragraph for all half - metallic ferromagnetic i / ii - iv / v alloys in all three zincblende , wurtzite and rocksalt metastable structures .",
    "the spin magnetic moment in these alloys follows a slater - pauling behavior with the total spin magnetic per formula unit in @xmath0 being 8 minus the number of valence electron in the unit cell : @xmath4 .",
    "the eight stems from the fact that in the majority - spin band we have exactly 4 occupied states ( one s and three p states ) and the rest of the electrons occupy exclusively the minority - spin states .",
    "the same reasoning stands even for heusler compounds like gekca and snkca which contain no transition metals and have been predicted to exhibit half - metallic ferromagnetism.@xcite evidence of the growth of such nanosctructures has been provided by liu et al who have reported successful self - assembly growth of ultrathin can in the rocksalt structure on top of cu(001).@xcite",
    "following the refs . and mentioned in the previous paragraph a lot of theoretical studies on sp - electron ferromagnets have appeared based on first principles calculations and we will give a short overview of them . a general trend",
    "is that the rocksalt ( rs ) structure is more stable than the zincblende ( zb ) or wurtzite ( wz ) structures , in all cases the slater - pauling ( sp ) rule for the total spin magnetic moment is obeyed and the spin magnetic moment is almost entirely concentrated to the anionic sites and the interstitial region while the cations show a spin moment one or two orders of magnitude smaller ( note that the occupied states are almost exclusively of anionic s- and p - character ) .",
    "also in most studied cases half - metallicity is conserved for large variations of the lattice constant assuming hydrostatic pressure .",
    "we will start our overview from the alkali - metal based alloys . in 2006 sieberer and",
    "collaborators predicted half - metallicity for lin and na(k)p(as ) in the zincblende structure with a total spin magnetic moment of 2 @xmath0 per formula unit ( f.u.)@xcite and in 2008 zhang confirmed the half - metallicity also for the alkali - metal carbides ( li , k , na)c with a total spin moment of 3 @xmath0 in accordance to the sp rule.@xcite after , zberecki and collaborators have demonstrated that the rocksalt is the most stable structure for alkali - metal nitrides with respect to the zincblende and wurtzite structures.@xcite these results were independently confirmed by yan,@xcite and by gao and collaborators who have also shown that among the alkali metal phosphides and arsenides , only kp and kas are half - metallic ferromagnets.@xcite finally , gao et al have also studied the alkali - metal sulfides ( li , na , k)s which exhibited a total spin magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 as expected by the sp rule for both the zb and the energetically - favored rs structures.@xcite    gao and collaborators have studied a series of alkaline - earth metal compounds with the ivth column elements and found that all casi , cage , cac , src and bac in the zb structure are half - metals.@xcite gao and yao have , then , studied src and bac in more detail and have shown that the rs structure in the most stable against the other metastable structures and found that both rs - src and rs - bac are half - metals with the curie temperature of src exceeding the room temperature ( 485 k).@xcite dong and zhao have shown that the alkaline - earth metal carbides retain their half - metallicity up to a hydrostatic pressure of 32gpa ( the volume is reduced by 30%),@xcite zhang et al have studied scc in the wz structure,@xcite and finally gao have shown that the ( 110 ) surface of zb - cac keep their half - metallic character contrary to the ( 001 ) surfaces .",
    "@xcite also verma and collaborators have studied the alkaline - earth metal silicides and found that only the zb - structure is half - metallic contrary to the more - stable rs ferromagnetic structure.@xcite        most of the attention has been focused on the alkaline - earth metal ( iind column ) compounds with the vth - column elements . as we have already mentioned",
    "half - metallicity has been predicted for the cap , caas and casb zb - alloys.@xcite sieberer et al studied all possible ii - v combinations in the zb and wz structures and found that all alloys containing ca , sr and ba are half - metallic while only mgn was half - metallic between the mg - based compounds.@xcite it was also shown in ref .",
    "that the ferromagnetic state is energetically preferable to both the non - magnetic and the antiferromagnetic configurations .",
    "yao et al have shown that the zb - alloys containing bi from the vth column are also half metals,@xcite but later on li and yu demonstrated that the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling destroys half - metallicity in these bi - alloys.@xcite volnianska and boguslawski , as well as geshi and collaborators have studied the alkaline - earth metal nitrides and have shown that the rs is the most stable structure with formation energies of about -11 ev per unit cell.@xcite gao et al have shown that among the rs alloys containing ca , sr or ba as a cation and n , p or as as an anion only the nitrides are stable half - metallic ferromagnets with a total spin magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 and cohesive energies about -9 ev per formula unit.@xcite droghetti and collaborators have shown that rs - mgn is in verge of the half - metallicity and suggested that mgn inclusion upon the n - doping of mgo should lead to a material suitable for magnetic tunnel junctions.@xcite the most recent studies on nitrides concern the curie temperature which was found to be well above the room temperature for can and srn in both the zb and rs structures,@xcite and the rs - can / zb - inn and rs - srn / zb - gap ( 111 ) interfaces which were found to retain half - metallicity only when the interface is made up from ca - n or n - in atoms in the first case and n - ga in the second case.@xcite    [ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "to simulate deformation of the lattices with respect to equilibrium we took into account three cases : ( i ) hydrostatic pressure ( hydro ) which is a uniform compression and expansion of the cubic lattice , ( ii ) tetragonalization of the lattice keeping the in - plane lattice parameters constants and equal to the equilibrium values and changing only the lattice parameter along the c - axis ( tetra - i ) , and ( iii ) tetragonalization where we vary both the in - plane and out - of - plane parameters keeping the unit cell volume constant to the equilibrium ( tetra - ii ) . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we have gathered our results concerning the spin magnetic moments for can and cap adopting the zb - lattice .",
    "we have also performed similar calculations for srn and srp but the behavior of the sr compounds is identical to the ca ones and thus we do not present them .",
    "moreover we present results also for can in the rocksalt structure which has been also widely studied in literature .",
    "preliminary results on srn in both zb and rs structure taking into account only the case of tetragonalization keeping the unit cell volume constant have been published in ref . .",
    "the latter type of distortion is expected to occur more often when these compounds are grown on top of various substrates , but the other two cases under study are also susceptible to occur and we include them aiming to give a better description of the properties of these alloys under various distortions . in the second column of the table we present for each one of the three cases the percentage of change ; `` - '' means compression by that percentage and `` + '' means expansion .",
    "moreover in the case of the hydrostatic pressure the percentage refers to the lattice constant since the expansion or compression is uniform , in the case of tetra - i where we keep constant the in - plane lattice parameters the percentage refers to the out - of - plane lattice parameter , and finally in case tetra - ii where we keep the unit - cell volume constant the percentage refers to the in - plane lattice constants . for each case we took six values of the percentage @xmath51 % , @xmath55 % and @xmath510 % .",
    "the larger changes in the unit cell volume occur for the hydrostatic case where @xmath510 %  change of the lattice constant means compression or expansion of the unit cell volume by about 27 % .",
    "amazingly even for these extreme cases can and cap in the zb lattice remain half - metallic with a total spin magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 .",
    "can in the rs - lattice shows similar behavior to the zb one and only in the case of 10% compression it is at the verge of half - metallicity and fermi level is located at the edge of the occupied majority - spin states ; this behavior occurs because the half - metallic gap ( energy difference between the upper edge of the occupied majority - spin states and the fermi level ) is 0.1 ev much smaller than the compounds in the zb lattice .",
    "deformations in can lead to small changes of the absolute values of the ca and n atomic spin magnetic moments of less than 0.07 @xmath0 in such a way that they cancel each other keeping the total spin moment constant .",
    "when we replace p for n in can the fluctuations of the atomic spin magnetic moments of the constituent atoms are even smaller .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we present for the alloys in table [ table2 ] the total dos taking into account expansion or compression by 10% which are the limiting cases studied and compare them with the dos for the ideal cubic lattices at the equilibrium lattice constants .",
    "we focus on the energy window including the p - d bonding hybrids which are the most relevant for magnetism . in the case of the @xmath51% and @xmath55% cases",
    "the dos for the distorted lattices coincide with the dos for the equilibrium lattice and the curves fall almost one on top of the other ; the only noticeable difference concerns the hydrostatic pressure case where compression leads to slightly wider bands and thus smaller pick intensities .",
    "differences in the dos are only visible in the case of the @xmath510% deformations presented in the figure .",
    "the most important changes occur in the case of hydrostatic pressure where compression leads to wider bands and expansion to narrower bands , this behavior being typical for p - orbitals . in the case of tetragonalization",
    "the zb - can shows very small changes in the dos shape while for zb - cap we remark a small redistribution of the weight of the empty minority - spin states just above the fermi level . for can in the rs - lattice the changes in the dos are even more marginal than for the zb - lattice .",
    "the large half - metallic gaps especially in the case of the zb lattice ensure that any small change in the characteristics of the dos does not affect the half - metallicity and the fermi level still crosses exclusively the minority - spin bands .",
    "the same image is also valid for the srn and srp alloys .",
    "thus we can safely conclude that deformation of the lattice only marginally affects the electronic properties as was the case also for the magnetic properties discussed just above .",
    "we have studied the properties of the xy ( x= mg , ca , sr and y= n , p , as , sb ) pnictides crystallizing in the zincblende structure using a full - potential electronic structure method in conjunction to the generalized gradient approximation .",
    "we have shown that the ca- and sr - based alloys should be classified as sp - electron ferromagnets ( also known as @xmath1-ferromagnets ) .",
    "moreover they are half - metals since the fermi level crosses only minority - spin states and the total spin magnetic moment per formula unit was found to be 1.0 @xmath0 .",
    "contrary to the ca and sr alloys , in the case of the mg alloys the p - d hybridization effect is much weaker and only mgn is a half - metallic ferromagnet while mgp , mgas and mgsb prefer energetically to be non - magnetic .",
    "we have also studied for these alloys the effect of deformation taking into account both the cases of hydrostatic pressure and tetragonalization keeping constant either the in - plane lattice parameters or the unit cell volume .",
    "even large degrees of deformation only marginally affected the electronic and magnetic properties of these alloys which kept their half - metallic ferromagnetic character .",
    "similar behavior is found also when they crystallize in the rocksalt instead of the zincblende structure .",
    "our results suggest that the alkaline - earth metal monopnictides are promising materials for spintronic applications ."
