    "one of the leading candidates to solve some of the well - known problems of the standard model ( sm ) , such as the hierarchy problem , is a class of models with warped extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "these models are characterized by the existence of a compact , curved extra dimension with ads geometry containing two 4-dimensional boundaries in the extra dimension , the so - called branes .    in these models the otherwise unnatural difference between the higgs mass and the planck scale is explained by an exponential warp factor between the two branes arising from the ads geometry , which fixes the ratio of the size of the extra dimension to the ads curvature radius , with the additional assumption that the higgs is localized in one of the branes ( the tev brane ) .",
    "the fermion mass hierarchy arises naturally by @xmath4 parameters that control the fermion wave functions in the extra dimensions , which in turn determines the yukawa couplings to the tev brane localized higgs boson @xcite .",
    "the same fermion wave functions also govern their potentially flavor - changing neutral current couplings to kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the gauge bosons , and as a result they are strongly suppressed for light quarks .",
    "this constitutes the so - called rs - gim mechanism @xcite , although some tension still exists in the kk contribution to @xmath5 oscillations . @xcite .    as in all models of extra dimensions ,",
    "warped models predict the existence of kaluza - klein excitations of the sm particles with mass scales determined by the compactification scale . in order to be consistent with electroweak precision tests , this scale is usually in the few tev range .",
    "detailed studies of the production and detectability of these excitations have been performed in the literature @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of these models arises from the fact the presence of the two branes breaks scale invariance , leading to the the existence of a dilaton - like particle , usually called radion .",
    "the radion , which we will denote by @xmath6 , has an important role in stabilizing the size of the extra dimension @xcite . as a dilaton , the radion couples to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of the theory .",
    "hence , its couplings are proportional to masses of particles , in much the same way as the usual higgs boson .",
    "as opposed to the kk excitations of sm particles , the radion mass is not determined by the compactification scale .",
    "it depends on the details of the mechanisms that stabilizes the size of the extra dimension and hence can be considered as a free parameter .",
    "it might very well be the lightest new particle in these models .",
    "many phenomenological studies have been dedicated to finding signals for the radion at colliders @xcite .",
    "some studies were also performed by atlas and cms a few years ago to assess the lhc reach for a radion decaying to @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in fact , many of the higgs searches can also be used for limiting the parameters of a radion model @xcite .",
    "this was already done using data from tevatron @xcite . with the recent results from the lhc ,",
    "it is finally possible to put bounds on parameters of the radion .",
    "one general feature of radion models is that the radion can in principle mix with the higgs boson .",
    "this mixing can have important phenomenological consequences .",
    "if one does not include the mixing , the only way to suppress the radion couplings is to increase its energy scale .",
    "therefore , lhc bounds will result in large values for the radion scale @xcite .",
    "however , including the mixing opens up a rich interplay with higgs physics and also allows the possibility to evade the lhc higgs exclusion constraints on the radion and the mixed higgs without increasing the new physics scale .    in this work we concentrate on",
    "the radion mediated processes @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and use lhc data for higgs searches up to a scalar mass of @xmath13 gev in order to exclude regions in the parameter space of the radion model .",
    "the higgs and radion cross sections can be easily related as follows .",
    "the proton - proton cross section for the production of a given final state @xmath14 via the radion in gluon - gluon fusion , which is the dominant process at the lhc with @xmath15 tev center - of - mass energy , can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gluon luminosity given by the parton distribution function of the gluons in a proton and @xmath18 is the partonic cross section . using a breit - wigner narrow width approximation one can relate the sm higgs cross section to a radion cross section with the same mass by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the total sm higgs and radion widths respectively .",
    "this should be a very good approximation since for most of the ranges of masses we will be considering both the higgs boson and the radion are very narrow resonances ( @xmath22 ) . in the next section",
    "we describe the model we will adopt to calculate the bounds on the radion .",
    "in this work we follow closely the realistic warped space scenario for the radion described by cski et al . @xcite .",
    "the unperturbed metric is written as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 refers to the coordinate in the 5th dimension restricted to @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the ads curvature .",
    "the radion is related to the scalar perturbation of the metric , which at leading order is given by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the 5d radion field .",
    "the linear radion couplings are determined by the modification of the action due to the linear perturbation of the metric , which by the definition of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath29 is given by : @xmath30    the canonically normalized scalar radion field in 4d is related to @xmath28 by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 can be interpreted as the radion vacuum expectation value that leads to the stabilization of the size of the extra dimension .",
    "for fields that are strongly localized in the infrared brane , such as the higgs boson and the top quark , the coupling to the radion is given by the usual term @xmath33    the leading contribution to the radion interaction with massive gauge bosons @xmath34 and @xmath35 and heavy fermions localized in the ir brane ( there are corrections depending on the localization parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 that are small when the fermions are localized in ir such as the top quark and they are not large for the @xmath38 quark , see @xcite ) is similar to the randall - sundrum set - up @xmath39    usually the coupling of the radion to massless gauge bosons vanishes at tree level . at 1-loop level",
    "it arises due to two contributions : the trace anomaly , which is related to the beta function , and the top quark triangle diagram .",
    "however , in the warped scenario , there are two main differences : a tree level bulk contribution from radion and gauge bosons wave functions and a modification in the beta function term to take into account that only particles in the infrared brane contribute to the running . however ,",
    "when a proper matching at 1-loop between the 5d and 4d coupling constants is performed , the usual beta function is recovered . the final result for this coupling is @xcite : @xmath40   f_{\\mu \\nu }   f^{\\mu \\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for photons and @xmath41   g_{\\mu \\nu}^a   g^{\\mu \\nu}_a\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for gluons , where @xmath42 and the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 as @xmath45 are defined in the usual way ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the coefficients of the sm @xmath1 functions we use are @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are related to the planck and tev - brane induced kinetic terms .",
    "the first term in the brackets is the usual radion contribution due to the qcd trace anomaly and the top triangle contributions .",
    "the other terms arise from the integration of the radion and gauge fields profiles in the bulk and the inclusion of brane - localized gauge field kinetic terms .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the term arising from the integration of the profiles resulting in the @xmath51 $ ] is actually of the same order of @xmath52 for a realistic value of @xmath53 and hence should not be neglected .",
    "for the higgs boson the situation is more involved because of two factors : spontaneous symmetry breaking and the fact that the energy - momentum tensor of a scalar field must be modified in order to allow the possibility that its trace can vanish in the zero - mass limit in the case of @xmath54 , resulting in a classically conformal invariant theory @xcite .    for a higgs lagrangian ( after symmetry breaking )",
    "@xmath55 the modified energy - momentum tensor @xmath56 reads @xcite : @xmath57 which leads to @xmath58 therefore , for @xmath54 , one gets @xmath59 where the first term of the trace of the modified energy - momentum tensor is proportional to the higgs mass whereas the second term will induce a mixing between the radion and the higgs boson .",
    "radion phenomenology is very sensitive to the values of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2 term for a general scalar field @xmath60 can be written as a coupling to the ricci scalar r as @xmath61 and it breaks a shift symmetry in the scalar field . in models where the higgs is a goldstone boson , one would expect the residual shift symmetry to forbid such a term , which correspondes to setting @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "even if the higgs is an approximate goldstone boson @xmath2 should be small .",
    "however , in general one can consider @xmath2 as a free parameter .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath2 results in radion - higgs mixing , which can be important for phenomenological purposes such as the goal of this letter .",
    "the radion - higgs mixing can be studied following the results of @xcite .",
    "one can write the physical radion and higgs fields that diagonalize the quadratic terms and have canonical normalization as : @xmath63 the physical masses @xmath3 and @xmath64 and the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 determine the mixing parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "their explicit expression can be found in , _",
    "e.g. _ , dominici _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in the case of no mixing ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we will be interested in the case where the radion is heavier than the higgs boson .",
    "it will be considered the cases where the higgs boson is outside the region where the standard model higgs has been recently excluded at @xmath69 cl , @xmath70 gev @xcite .",
    "we will also comment on the possibility of hiding a heavier higgs bosons .",
    "we denote in the following the ratio of the sm vacuum expectation value to the radion scale @xmath71 .",
    "the effects of the radion potential arising from the stabilization mechanism , such as triple and quartic radion couplings , and brane - localized kinetic terms are not included , since both effects are very model - dependent .",
    "the ratio of the radion width to the same - mass sm higgs boson width is the same in the fermionic and electroweak gauge boson channels ( @xmath12 ) ( neglecting again small contributions from the fermion localization factors ) and is given by @xcite @xmath72 since these decays modes are dominant for most regions of parameter space , the branching ratio of the radion and the higgs in these channels are similar .",
    "the exception occurs when there is a cancellation such that @xmath73 , in which case the radion becomes phobic to both fermions and vector bosons . in this case",
    "there will be much weaker bounds from the lhc , since the decay rates will be decreased , but the production rate remains significant since it is dominated by the anomaly .",
    "this region of parameter space will show up in our results .",
    "the ratio of the radion width into gluons to the width of a same mass sm higgs boson is @xmath74 and similarly for the photon channel @xmath75    when kinematically allowed , the radion can also decay into 2 higgs bosons .",
    "we use the feynman rules given in [ dggt ] to derive @xmath76    finally , for the partial and total widths of the sm higgs boson we use the results from hdecay code @xcite and write for the total radion width : @xmath77",
    "in what follows we take as free parameters of the radion model the physical radion mass , @xmath3 , the radion vacuum expectation value , @xmath0 and the mixing parameter @xmath2 . as mentioned before we will consider the case where the mixed higgs boson mass is @xmath78 gev , so that it has escaped detection so far and also the case where it is inside the region where the standard model higgs has been excluded .",
    "we will fix @xmath79 in order to solve the large hierarchy problem .",
    "one must notice that for a given value of @xmath3 and @xmath0 there is a limited range of values that the mixing parameter can assume , given by the condition that the unmixed masses are real .",
    "there is another bound on @xmath2 arising from perturbative unitarity in @xmath80 scattering @xcite .",
    "however , requiring that perturbative unitarity is maintained up to a scale of @xmath81(tev ) results in the two bounds being similar .",
    "we take into account this maximum range of @xmath2 in our results .",
    "we use the cms data on the higgs search with approximately @xmath82 fb@xmath83 integrated luminosity recently presented at cern @xcite , considering only the individual channels @xmath7 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the so - called cl@xmath86 method is used to put bounds at 95% confidence level on @xmath87 , the signal strength modifier , where @xmath88 is the  true \" cross section and @xmath89 is the predicted sm cross section .",
    "it is assumed the sm branching ratios throughout their analysis . due to the similarities between the radion and the higgs boson , it is straightforward to use the data on higgs searches to constrain parameters in the radion model . in this case the signal strength modifier",
    "is simply given by eq.([enhancement ] ) , where the corrections for the different branching ratios are taken into account .",
    "notice that because there are always ratios of quantites for the higgs boson and for the radion of the same mass , one expects that higher order corrections such as nlo qcd k - factors will be cancelled , since their production mechanism is the same .    in fig.([exclusionxizero ] ) we show the exclusion regions for a pure radion with no - mixing ( @xmath62 ) for the different channels , with a higgs mass fixed at @xmath90 gev .",
    "one can see that there are regions where the bounds are very stringent .",
    "for instance , for @xmath91 tev , a radion mass in the range @xmath92 gev is already excluded .",
    "it is only possible to have a pure radion with a mass @xmath93 gev if its couplings are suppressed by @xmath94 tev .",
    "however , for @xmath95 gev the bounds are less stringent , allowing for @xmath96 tev .     and @xmath3 coming from cms data for a pure radion ( @xmath97 ) and a light higgs @xmath90 gev .",
    "the white regions are excluded whereas the colored regions are allowed .",

    "the region above the solid line is allowed by data from @xmath99 channel.,width=264 ]    the lhc constraints can be ameliorated with the inclusion of a non - zero mixing parameter . in fig.([exclusionlighthiggs ] ) we show some of the exclusion regions in the @xmath100 plane from the cms higgs search for two extreme scenarios where the @xmath80 constraints are strong ( @xmath93 gev ) and weak ( @xmath101 gev ) , fixing again the higgs mass at @xmath90 gev .",
    "we can see from the most constrained situation that a radion mixed with the higgs is allowed all the way down to @xmath102 tev , insofar as direct searches at the lhc are concerned .",
    "this is possible because of the  funnel \" region for @xmath2 where the cancellation in the @xmath103 couplings of the radion mentioned earlier occurs . the solid line that runs exactly in the  funnel \" are the values where the second order term in the eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiovv ] ) vanishes . from now on we will call these values @xmath104 . in the scenario with @xmath90 gev and @xmath101 gev , where the lhc constraints are weaker , there is a larger allowed region of parameter space .",

    "as was already explained , in the funnel region the couplings of the radion to fermions and massive gauge bosons are suppressed .",
    "one could expect that because the radion becomes fermiophobic ( and gaugephobic ) its production cross section by gluon fusion will also get suppressed .",

    "this is consistent with the recent results on the higgs searches using almost @xmath126 of data collected on 2011 .",

    "<S> the radion , a scalar particle associated with the radius of a compact warped extra dimension , may be the lightest new particle in this class of models . </S>",
    "<S> its couplings to sm particles are proportional to the their masses , similar to the usual higgs boson , but suppressed by a scale @xmath0 , the radion vacuum expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> the main differences are the coupling to massless gauge bosons that receives contribution from the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor due to the the nonvanishing @xmath1 functions and the mixing with the higgs boson arising from a nonminimal coupling to gravity parametrized by a dimensionless coefficient @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these differences can result in significant modifications of the radion phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> we use current lhc data on higgs searches to find exclusion regions on the parameters of a radion model , @xmath0 , @xmath2 and the radion mass @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , even for low values of @xmath0 , the radion can still have a mass in the region where the standard model higgs has been excluded , for a narrow range of values for the mixing parameter . </S>",
    "<S> some signals at the lhc for this scenario are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that it is possible to hide the higgs boson in the current searches in this model , due to a suppression of its couplings . </S>"
