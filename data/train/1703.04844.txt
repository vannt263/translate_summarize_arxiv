    "the wigner function  @xcite provides a particularly useful visual representation of the state of a bosonic single mode quantum system as a real valued function on the two - dimensional system phase space . integrating the wigner function with respect to the system position coordinate @xmath0 gives the marginal probability density in the momentum coordinate @xmath1 ( and vice versa ) ; more generally , integrating the wigner function with respect to any quadrature phase coordinate @xmath2 gives the marginal probability density in the complementary quadrature phase coordinate @xmath3 . in terms of the wigner function , the quantum expectation value of a ( weyl ordered ) observable @xmath4 is evaluated in exactly the same way as for the corresponding classical system described by a phase space probability distribution function .",
    "furthermore , the master equation that describes the open quantum system dynamics gets mapped to a partial differential equation for the wigner function dynamics that closely resembles the fokker planck equation for the classical system statistical dynamics .    given the close resemblance between the wigner function representation of the quantum system dynamical equations and the corresponding classical statistical dynamical equations , the wigner function has helped provide an understanding of how classical dynamics arises by approximation from the underlying quantum dynamics  @xcite . of particular interest in this respect",
    "are nonlinear single mode systems such as the driven , damped duffing oscillator .",
    "a number of investigations have employed the wigner function representation to explore the resulting quantum phase space dynamics in parameter regimes where the corresponding classical nonlinear dynamics exhibits , for example , bistability or chaos  @xcite . by varying the system damping and noise ( diffusion ) due to coupling to the environment",
    ", the quantum to classical transition can be explored in a controllable and visually direct way by comparing the corresponding quantum wigner function phase space and classical phase space pictures .",
    "however , the wigner function can take negative values and so is not a true probability distribution , despite the properties mentioned above .",
    "the presence of regions in phase space where the wigner function is negative is conventionally interpreted as a signature of nonclassicality in the quantum state ; with the exception of gaussian ( i.e. , coherent and squeezed ) states , _ all _ pure states have negative - valued wigner function regions and hence are nonclassical  @xcite .",
    "well known examples are the harmonic oscillator energy eigenstates or fock states and so - called schrdinger cat states involving superpositions of different coherent states . as with the above - mentioned quantum - classical correspondence investigations ,",
    "the wigner function has served as a very effective visual tool in the investigation of the generation and detection of nonclassical states of bosonic , single as well as few mode quantum systems .",
    "a range of investigations have been carried out involving optical  @xcite , microwave cavity  @xcite and superconducting circuit systems  @xcite , as well as nanomechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "a sought after goal for such bosonic mode systems is to generate macroscopic quantum states that are stable over long times against the decohering effects of the environment  possibly even under ` warm ' conditions where the environment temperature is large compared to the characteristic frequency scale of the system dynamics .",
    "stabilized macroscopic quantum states are useful not only for quantum information processing applications , but also for fundamental explorations , especially concerning how macroscopic a quantum state can be in the presence of unavoidable decohering environments .    by ` macroscopic ' , we mean that the average photon or phonon number of the stabilized system quantum state is large , while by ` quantum ' we mean that that the wigner function representation of the state has significant negative regions in the system phase space .",
    "how large can a negative wigner valued region be ?",
    "two classic theorems that can be easily generalized to mixed states establish that the wigner function is generally bounded in magnitude by @xmath5  @xcite , while the area of a given negative wigner valued region can exceed @xmath6 , but where at least one of the dimensions must be of order @xmath7 or smaller  @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 harmonic oscillator fock state has a single negative annular wigner function region of area @xmath9 and radial width @xmath10",
    ".    approaches to stabilizing quantum states involve measurement feedback to control the quantum system dynamics  @xcite , as well as so - called autonomous methods that do not require measurement feedback control .",
    "the latter typically involve ` reservoir engineering ' , where the effective system - environment interaction is tailored in such a way as to evolve the system into a quantum state as well as to protect the state from the decohering effects of the environment  @xcite .    another approach to autonomously generating quantum states exploits the nonlinearities in the closed bosonic mode system dynamics ",
    "equivalently anharmonicities in the system hamiltonian .",
    "the presence of anharmonicities can cause initial gaussian states with associated positive wigner functions to evolve into nonclassical states with associated negative valued wigner functions ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in terms of the quantum fokker planck dynamical equations for the wigner function ,",
    "the root cause of such evolution is the presence of a third or higher order position derivative term involving the system potential energy . only when the potential energy is anharmonic is this term present and without this term , the wigner function dynamical equation coincides with the classical fokker planck equation .",
    "for example , in the case of the driven duffing oscillator with @xmath11 anharmonicity in the potential energy and the resulting coexistence of bistable large and small amplitude oscillatory solutions for the classical dynamics , an initial coherent state will transiently evolve into a schrdinger cat - like state where the wigner function displays a sequence of alternating negative and positive regions in between the corresponding large and small amplitude positive wigner function peaks  @xcite ; in a classically chaotic regime , an initial coherent state will spread out in phase space , exhibiting a complex inference pattern of positive and sub-@xmath6 ( sub - planckian ) scale negative wigner function regions  @xcite .",
    "however , depending on the environment temperature , such non - classical features will typically diffuse away for the usual device system - environment couplings , leaving a long time steady state that is closely approximated by the corresponding classical system fokker - planck equation .",
    "nevertheless , the question is still largely unresolved as to whether it might be possible to stabilize quantum states largely with anharmonicities alone . in particular , for certain anharmonicity types and drives ( whether externally or internally generated by the system dynamics ) , we may be able to prepare and maintain quantum states with significant associated negative wigner function regions , despite the counteracting decoherence effects of environmental noise .",
    "recent relevant developments in superconducting microwave resonator ( as well as coupled nanomechanical resonator ) circuits involving embedded josephson junction elements provide strong motivation for pursuing this question  @xcite",
    ". in particular , the josephson elements can induce strong effective anharmonicities in the microwave mode hamiltonian , as well as internally generated drive tones through the ac - josephson effect .",
    "one consequence is lasing - like behavior  @xcite , with the continuous , stimulated emission of amplitude - squeezed microwave photons  @xcite .    with the above motivations in mind , in the present work we will extend the wigner formulation of the open quantum system dynamics and take into account also the so - called wigner function flow vector field ( or ` wigner flow ' in short )  @xcite .",
    "the wigner flow allows a particularly concise reformulation of the quantum fokker planck equation as a standard continuity equation , equating ( via the familiar gauss s theorem of vector calculus ) the rate of change of the net wigner quasiprobability within some two dimensional region to net wigner flows normal to the boundary enclosing the region ; loosely speaking , the phase space flow picture is somewhat analogous to a system involving a distribution of positive and negative charges ( e.g. electrons and holes ) that can be annihilated and created , albeit described by a quite different quantum statistical dynamics .",
    "the potential advantage of bringing the wigner flows into play is that they can give a strong visual representation of how non - classical states form through the system hamiltonian anharmonicity , as well as diffuse away due to the environment . by exploring the relative contributions to the net wigner flow across the boundary of a given negative region arising from the system hamiltonian anharmonicity and from the interactions with the environment",
    ", we may be able to improve our understanding of how to ` engineer ' system hamiltonian anharmonicities and drive stones so as to stabilize macroscopic bosonic quantum states in the face of environmental noise .",
    "the present work gives some initial steps in this direction .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "for a one dimensional particle with hamiltonian @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ( time dependent ) anharmonic potential energy , a possible lindblad master equation that describes the quantum dynamics of the system state characterized by density matrix @xmath14 interacting weakly with an oscillator bath can be written as follows : @xmath15+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}(\\bar{n}+1)\\left(2 a\\rho a^{\\dagger}-a^{\\dagger}a\\rho-\\rho a^{\\dagger}a\\right)\\cr & & + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\bar{n}\\left(2a^{\\dagger}\\rho a - a a^{\\dagger}\\rho-\\rho a a^{\\dagger}\\right ) , \\label{mastereq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the system energy damping rate , @xmath17 is the bose - einstein thermal average occupation number of the temperature @xmath18 bath at the characteristic frequency @xmath19 of the system hamiltonian .",

    "this is just the process of decoherence viewed in terms of the wigner flow .    in order to gain a better understanding of how regions where the wigner function is negative initially form , are stabilized , or eventually disappear , let us suppose that the wigner function at some given time instant @xmath84 is negative in certain regions of phase space .",
    "this is the case for the initial fock state and coherent state superposition examples considered above ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : figure1]-[fig : figure4 ] ) , while for the duffing oscillator , we see that negative wigner function regions are generated through the dynamics ( figs .",
    "[ fig : figure5]-[fig : figure8 ] ) . consider a particular negative region with phase space area @xmath85 and boundary @xmath86 , where the indicated @xmath84-dependence accounts for the fact that the negative region evolves in time . in particular , the boundary is defined by @xmath87 .",

    "( [ negduffrateeq ] ) vanishes ( since @xmath92 ) and the rate of change of the region negativity is affected solely by the environmental diffusion flow  ( [ dimlessdifffloweq ] ) . since the wigner function is by definition negative on the interior region and positive on at least the immediate exterior region of the boundary @xmath86 , the gradient @xmath93 points outwards so that @xmath94 everywhere on the boundary .",
    "therefore , for the harmonic oscillator we have that @xmath95 and we thus see that the size of the negative regions always decreases with time at a rate governed by the environmental diffusion flow .    on the other hand , for the duffing oscillator system ( @xmath96 ) , we see from eq .",
    "( [ negduffrateeq ] ) that the rate of change of the region negativity is governed by two flow contributions : the system quantum flow @xmath97 and the environmental diffusion flow  ( [ dimlessdifffloweq ] ) . since the environmental diffusion destroys negative regions , the system quantum flow must therefore be responsible for the initial generation and possible eventual stabilization of negative regions in the steady state . in particular , for a growing negative region",

    "eventually , the negative regions practically vanish even at zero temperature as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5](c ) .",
    "because the chosen parameter values result in coexisting small and large amplitude stable oscillations for the classical dynamics , the wigner function must correspondingly spread out through flow and quantum diffusion from its initially narrow and strongly peaked coherent state distribution [ fig .",

    "the magnitude of the term @xmath99 must decrease overall , and with the small chosen anharmonic coupling strength value @xmath38  ( @xmath109 ) , the system quantum term is too weak to counter the deleterious effects of the diffusion term in eq .",

    "in this present work , we extended the wigner phase space formulation of open quantum system dynamics to include a description of the wigner flow vector fields on phase space .",
