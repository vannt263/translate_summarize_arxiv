    "in recent years , it was realized that chaos can have useful applications . among others we mention the diffusive ionization of a hydrogen atom by a microwave field @xcite , the dissociation of polyatomic molecules by laser radiation due to the transition to chaos @xcite , the stabilization of chaotic laser radiation @xcite by the controlling chaos method @xcite , secret communications @xcite using synchronization of chaotic systems @xcite , and chaos is even promisible in the generation of music variations and other sequences of context - dependent symbols @xcite .",
    "all applications mentioned dealt with classical chaos .",
    "recently the main activity in chaos has been shifting to the studies of quantum chaos , particularities in the behavior of quantum systems that are chaotic in the classical limit @xcite . as a rule ,",
    "quantum effects distort or suppress `` useful '' manifestations of classical chaos .",
    "for example , in the most studied system , a hydrogen atom in a microwave field , quantum effects suppress diffusive ionization by the mechanism of quantum localization @xcite ( the analog of anderson localization in a solid state @xcite ) or by the appearance of `` scars '' of a wave function @xcite in the vicinity of classical unstable periodic orbits of the corresponding classical model of the atom @xcite . the only probable useful application known to us ( and in particular in the area of quantum optics ) for quantum chaos",
    "is the suggestion @xcite to utilize the effect of wave function localization in a one - dimensional quantum chaotic system driven by a periodic external field , for the generation of electromagnetic field in the fock state .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the possibility of squeezed states of the light generation @xcite at the transition to quantum chaos .",
    "we show that the maximal possible degree of squeezing , achievable during some time interval of measurement , for chaotic dynamics is much greater than for regular dynamics during the same time interval .",
    "we find a direct correlation between the degree of squeezing and the value of the local lyapunov instability rate in the corresponding classical chaotic system .",
    "our consideration @xcite is based on three simple but general ideas : + ( i ) a free electromagnetic field is in a coherent state that is a gaussian wave packet .",
    "a wave packet spreads when it propagates through a nonlinear medium .",
    "however , there still exists a time interval of well - defined quantum - classical correspondence during which the wave packet follows a path in phase space closed to the path defined by ( semi)classical equations of motion . during this time interval ,",
    "localized wave packet demonstrates squeezing in one direction of phase space and stretching in another direction . as a result",
    ", one of the field quadrature components may be observed in the squeezed state at some time moments . due to the presence of the local strong ( exponential ) instability inherent in the underlying classical chaotic dynamics @xcite , _",
    "the stretching and squeezing of the wave packet for quantum chaos is much stronger than for the case of the regular and stable dynamics _",
    ", when the distance between two initially closed trajectories in phase space increases in time only in a power wise way @xcite .",
    "+ ( ii ) the time interval of the quantum - classical correspondence depends on the number of quanta involved in the nonlinear dynamics : it has a power dependence on the number of quanta for regular dynamics , and this dependence is logarithmic for chaotic dynamics @xcite . in spite of the time interval of the localized wave packet motion ,",
    "when enhanced squeezing is expected , at chaotic dynamics may be very short , this time scale seems quite observable in modern experiments on light squeezing @xcite , where average number of photons @xmath0 involved in the nonlinear interaction is as great as @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , in the conditions of the experiments , the time of the localized wave packet motion and the well - defined quantum - classical correspondence may be of the same order as the time scale when dissipation and other factors restricting squeezing could be neglected . + ( iii ) along with stretching and squeezing , another inherent characteristic of chaos in bounded phase space is folding . for strong chaos",
    "there are strong and multiple foldings of the wave packet ; therefore , the time intervals of squeezing become very short and squeezing even becomes unstable @xcite .",
    "however , at the same time that strong folding appears , the wave packet becomes delocalized and well - defined quantum - classical correspondence , which we understand here as the motion of a wave packet center along a classical trajectory , is broken @xcite .",
    "therefore , if one studies the dynamics of the wave packet only on a time scale of well - defined quantum - classical correspondence , the squeezing could be strong and still rather stable for not very strong chaos or even for regular trajectories lying in phase space near the chaotic region .",
    "it is already known that light squeezing can be increased near the bifurcation points between different dynamical regimes @xcite . among with well - studied parametric media",
    "@xcite , such an increase of squeezing was predicted also for the interaction of the field with 2-level atoms inside a high-@xmath2 cavity @xcite .",
    "the explanation of enhanced squeezing near the bifurcation point has been used @xcite and it is very similar to the arguments presented above that utilize quantum chaos for large squeezing : at the transition ( bifurcation ) between different dynamic regimes , there should exists some diverging variable , and then the conjugate variable should be strongly squeezed . in spite of the similarity , our suggestion has two significant differences .",
    "first , all papers devoted to the study of the enhanced squeezing in the vicinity of instability threshold @xcite dealt with the integrable or near - integrable systems with _ regular dynamics_. instead , we suggest the use of the transition from _ regular _ to _ chaotic _ dynamics .",
    "second , from the general viewpoint , the transition to chaos and chaos itself are frequent phenomena and , as a rule , they take place for a rather wide region of the control parameters , in contrast to a commonly narrow region of control parameter characterizing a bifurcation between different regimes of regular motion .    in this paper",
    "we consider the squeezed light generation by nonlinear nonintegrable optical systems obeying the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the classical limit . as for other problems of quantum chaos @xcite",
    ", we deal with the semiclassical limit when a great number of quantum levels @xmath3 are involved into the dynamics .",
    "our consideration is valid for any nondissipative quantum system with one and half degrees of freedom , but we demonstrate our main results on the enhanced squeezing for some particular model of the nonintegrable optical system : the nonlinear oscillator periodically forced by the classical field . to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the systems and the dynamics of squeezing in the semiclassical limit , it is natural to use the cumulant expansion technique @xcite as a variant of the general @xmath4-expansion method @xcite . in this paper , we use the @xmath4-expansion method suggested in @xcite , which is well - adopted for the problems of quantum optics .",
    "we show that as long as the wave packet is localized , its dynamics may be well described by the behavior of the mean values accounting for quantum corrections and the lowest - order quantum cumulants .",
    "we demonstrate that the equations of motion for the second order cumulants are essentially the same as those are used in the definition of the lyapunov exponent for the corresponding classical system .",
    "this fact gives us the opportunity to find direct correlation between the degree of light squeezing and the degree of local instability in the corresponding classical system .",
    "we also compare our approach with the generalized gaussian approximation @xcite , which is used to find approximate solutions of many problems of quantum optics @xcite , as well as with a similar variant of the cumulant expansion @xcite , and find good agreement with minor differences .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows . in the next section , using @xmath4-expansion method and starting from the heisenberg equations of motion , we derive the self - consistent set of equations for the mean values and second - order cumulants describing the dynamics of quantum fluctuations in the semiclassical limit for an arbitrary quantum system with one and half degrees of freedom .",
    "we show that these equations coincide with the equations used for the calculation of the classical lyapunov exponent . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the conditions of validity of our basic equations for regular and chaotic dynamics and compare our approach with the results of other semiclassical techniques used in both quantum optics and quantum chaos studies .",
    "we consider the dynamics of light squeezing at the transition to quantum chaos , and compare it with the dynamics of squeezing for regular and stable motion in section 4 .",
    "we illustrate our results on enhanced squeezing at the transition to chaos in the model of a kicked quantum oscillator in section 5 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in the final section 6 .",
    "we begin with a single - mode quantum system described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 including an explicit dependence on time , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are bose operators ( @xmath8=1 $ ] ) of the mode .",
    "we use normal ordering of operators .",
    "let our system include some large parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 may represent the number of quanta ( photons ) pumped to the system @xcite or the number of degrees of freedom of a quantum system @xcite . because we are interested in semiclassical limit @xmath9 , it is useful to introduce new operators for the annihilation and creation of photons @xmath10 with the commutation relation @xmath11=1/n.\\ ] ] in the classical limit ( @xmath9 ) , one has two commuting @xmath12-numbers .",
    "the natural quantum states for the consideration of the quantum system in semiclassical limit are coherent states @xcite .",
    "thus we suppose that our quantum system is initially in the coherent state @xmath13 corresponding to the mean number of quanta @xmath14 . following the general scheme of the @xmath4-expansion method @xcite , we rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath15 in the form @xmath16 where the hamiltonian @xmath17 generates the correct classical equations of motion in the classical limit @xmath9 . in the classical limit , the operators @xmath18 , @xmath19 , following ( [ 2 ] ) ,",
    "may be considered as @xmath12-numbers of order of unity and all quantum corrections being of order of or less than @xmath4 could be treated by perturbation theory .    in order to illustrate the representation of hamiltonian in the form ( [ 3 ] ) , consider a particular model of the nonintegrable quantum system : the nonlinear oscillator periodically driven by the classical field . in the interaction picture , the hamiltonian has the form ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 describe a single mode of the quantum field and @xmath22 is proportional to the third - order nonlinear susceptibility of a nonlinear medium .",
    "the last term in ( [ 4 ] ) corresponds to a coupling of the oscillator with an external classical periodically modulated field containing a large number of photons @xmath3 ( @xmath23 is a coupling constant , @xmath24 is a periodic function of time , and @xmath25 is a detuning of the mode frequency from the carrier frequency of the external field ) .",
    "using new operators @xmath26 given in ( [ 1 ] ) , the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) may be represented in the form ( [ 3 ] ) with @xmath27 it may be shown that in the classical limit @xmath3 , when we have classical variables @xmath28 ,",

    "the self - consistent system of equations ( [ 20 ] ) completely describes the dynamics of quantum fluctuations in the first order of @xmath4 .",
    "we shall use these equations for the description of the dynamics of light squeezing at the transition to quantum chaos in section 4 after a discussion of the validity of our approach and its comparison with other semiclassical methods .",

    "the time scale ( [ 24 ] ) is very short for small @xmath0 . however , under the conditions of modern experiments on light squeezing , where the average number of photons @xmath0 involved in the nonlinear interaction is @xmath111 , @xmath110 is of the order of @xmath112 of the system s characteristic periods @xmath113 and thus it looks quite reasonable .",
    "we now compare our approach to the description of the dynamics of quantum fluctuations with that widely used in quantum optics and called the generalized gaussian approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation also assumes the existence of a well - localized , almost gaussian wave packet throughout the time of quantum evolution and in this respect it is very closed to our consideration .",
    "more precisely , the generalized gaussian approximation consists in an assumption that the fourier transform of the quantum distribution function , i.e. the quantum characteristic function , is gaussian for any moment of time @xcite .",
    "such a quantum state corresponds to the superposition of the coherent signal and small quantum noise @xcite .",
    "for such a state , only the first- and second - order cumulants are nonzero .",
    "it possesses the expression for higher - order cumulants in terms of only the first and second - order cumulants and truncation of an infinite hierarchy dynamic system for cumulants is possible .",
    "we compare our system ( [ 20 ] ) with the dynamic equations for the mean values and cumulants obtained within the generalized gaussian approximation for several popular models of quantum optics : second harmonic generation described by the hamiltonian @xmath114=1 , \\quad \\omega_2=2\\omega_1,\\ ] ] the problem of nondegenerate optical 3-wave mixing described by the hamiltonian @xmath115 and for the periodically forced nonlinear oscillator with the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) .",

    "we turn now to the discussion of squeezing at the transition from regular to chaotic motion .",

    "moreover , because our equations of motion for cumulants ( [ 20c ] ) and ( [ 20d ] ) in fact coincide with the equations arising from the definition of the maximum lyapunov exponent , we can apply simple physical arguments to the strong deformation of the classical phase volume at chaos for the prediction of the strong squeezing of the noise ellipse at quantum chaos in the semiclassical limit .",

    "the increment of local instability and the corresponding degree of squeezing are complex functions of the initial conditions or parameters . as a result",
    ", the dependence of squeezing on initial conditions or parameters may be rather complex .",
    "3 , we plot the minimum value @xmath173 of the principal squeezing during seven kicks and degree of the local instability @xmath169 as a function of the kick s period @xmath174 at fixed initial conditions , @xmath175 , and number of quanta @xmath171 .",
    "the regions of parameter values with mainly regular or chaotic motion in the classical limit @xmath176 are marked in the center of the plot .",
    "the first large region of chaos begins at @xmath177 , which is in good agreement with the approximate criterion ( [ 31a ] ) of the transition to chaos .",
    "of course , there are some singular values of the parameter @xmath174 corresponding to regular motion in the range of @xmath174 that is mainly filled by chaotic trajectories .    as is evident from fig .",

    "because we present the dependences of @xmath169 and squeezing on @xmath174 for only seven kicks , the degree of instability and squeezing may be comparable for some points from regular and chaotic ranges of @xmath174 .",

    "5a . in spite of",
    "the correlation between the degree of squeezing and @xmath179 it is also evident in fig .",
    "5a that the increase of squeezing at the transition from regular to chaotic motion @xmath180 is smoothed more than in the case of nine kicks shown in fig .",
    "4 .    as we already mentioned , the degree of local instability",
    "may itself depend on time .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5b , where in an interval of @xmath181 kicks the instability for @xmath182 ( curve 1 ) is greater than for @xmath183 ( curve 2 ) . as a result , the squeezing during 3 kicks at @xmath182 ( point 1 in fig .",
    "5a ) is greater than for @xmath183 ( point 2 in fig .",
    "5a ) . after eight kicks",
    "we have inverse picture : the instability for @xmath183 is greater than at @xmath182 ( see fig .",
    "5b ) resulting in enhanced squeezing for the parameter s values of point 1 in comparison to squeezing for the parameter s values of point 2 .    summarizing our findings from figs .",
    "3 - 5 , we see that in the semiclassical limit the degree of squeezing has a one - to - one correspondence to the degree of local instability in the system . for a short time of the order of several kicks ,",
    "the dependence of squeezing on the lyapunov exponent , which is calculated in the limit @xmath136 , is not well pronounced .",
    "moreover , squeezing for regular motion located near the border of the transition to chaos is comparable to squeezing for weak chaos .",
    "the dependence of squeezing on the value of the lyapunov exponent becomes more pronounced for moderate times of the order of ten kicks .",
    "we compare now the time - dependence of principal squeezing for different @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath128 on @xmath184 at @xmath185 ( curve 1 ) and at @xmath186 ( curve 2 ) is presented in fig . 6 for the case of mild chaos .",
    "curves 1 and 2 coincide during seven kicks , which determines the time interval of well - defined quantum - classical correspondence for such a choice of parameters .",
    "moreover , our numerical calculations demonstrate that if the number of quanta increases in two orders up to @xmath171 , the squeezing is indistinguishable from squeezing at @xmath185 up to fifteen kicks .",
    "this finding is well explained by remembering @xmath187 dependence ( [ 24 ] ) of the time scale .",
    "thus we demonstrate that an increase in the average number of photons @xmath0 results in corresponding increase of the time interval for the applicability of our description of squeezing dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , the number of photons @xmath188 initially pumped to the system is quite realistic for contemporary experiments on light squeezing @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the stability of chaotic squeezing .",
    "the time - dependence of the optimal local oscillator phase @xmath122 given in ( [ 28 ] ) for the cases of regular and mild chaos is shown in fig . 7 for two slightly different initial conditions @xmath189 and @xmath190 . the deviation of the optimal local oscillator phase values related to different @xmath165 in the case of regular dynamics is small during all time evolution presented in fig.7 ( see dashed and dotted curves ) .",
    "for chaos ( @xmath191 , @xmath175 ) , the deviation is sufficient only at the fifth kick ( boxes and crosses in fig.7 ) .",
    "thus , for not very strong chaos , there is a time interval during which squeezing is enhanced and still stable .",
    "in ref . @xcite a fundamental question was asked : `` what is the best squeezing device ? '' the answer founded in @xcite is based on the fact that `` the quantum noise reduction is effective below and above the bifurcation points between dynamical regimes '' .",
    "the reason for enhanced squeezing consists in the fact that `` the same classical linearized equations are used to study the stability of the system and to calculate its quantum fluctuations '' @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that only integrable or near integrable systems with regular dynamics were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the results of our paper demonstrate that in addition to a very narrow class of integrable systems near the threshold of instability , there is another wide class of potentially `` the best squeezing devices '' : systems at the transition to quantum chaos operating during the time interval of the well - defined quantum - classical correspondence .    in this paper",
    "we have presented a semiclassical theory for the quantum systems with one and half degrees of freedom and illustrated our findings on the model of kicked nonlinear oscillator .",
    "direct numerical observation of enhanced squeezing in the model of a kicked quantum rotator at the transition to quantum chaos ( nonperturbative approach ) will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
