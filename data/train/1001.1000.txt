    "the latter effect has been extensively investigated in atomic physics in connection , for instance , with the problem of autoionization of an atom by ultraviolet radiation or in laser - induced continuum structures ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the simplest case , population trapping in the continuum describes decay suppression of two discrete states coupled to a common and unstructured continuum : as a single bound state coupled to the continuum decays in an irreversible way and population is transferred into the continuum , under certain conditions coupling of the continuum with the additional other bound state may partially or totally suppress the decay of states owing to a destructive interference effect which was first studied by fano for radiative transitions to autoionizing states in atoms @xcite .",
    "fano - like resonances in photonic systems have been considered in several recent works as well @xcite , with a main focus on the scattering ( transmission ) properties of the structures .",
