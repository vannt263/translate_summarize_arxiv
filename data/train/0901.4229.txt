    "low - mass discs orbiting massive compact bodies are a feature of many astronomical systems .",
    "when the dynamics of a disc is dominated by the newtonian gravitational force of the central body , the disc may be considered nearly keplerian . in a purely keplerian potential eccentric orbits",
    "do not precess because the orbital frequency is equal to the epicyclic frequency . in a nearly keplerian disc",
    "there is a small difference between the orbital and epicyclic frequencies .",
    "this could be due to the self - gravity of the disc , thermal pressure in a gas disc , and random motions in a collisionless disc .",
    "this difference in frequencies manifests as a precession of eccentric orbits at rates that are small compared to the orbital and epicyclic frequencies .",
    "then the disc may be able to support large - scale , slow , lopsided modes @xcite . in the linear regime",
    ", these modes have azimuthal frequency , @xmath0 , whose first systematic investigation is due to @xcite .",
    "he studied slow modes in various types of discs ( fluid , collisionless and softened gravity ) , with the focus largely on the effect of the self - gravity of the disc .",
    "in particular , a wkb analysis was used to show that the fluid disc can support large - scale slow modes when the mach number , @xmath3 , is much larger than the toomre @xmath4 parameter ( both parameters are defined in   2 ) .",
    "the assumption behind this analysis is that the self - gravity of the disc dominates fluid pressure .",
    "however , such is not the case for thin accretion discs around white dwarfs and neutron stars . indeed , for a disc around a white dwarf @xcite , we can estimate @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; hence the analysis of @xcite is not directly applicable .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study large - scale @xmath0 slow modes in thin accretion discs , where @xmath7 .    in ",
    "2 we use the wkb approximation to establish that pressure , in the absence of self - gravity , can enable slow , @xmath0 modes in thin accretion discs .",
    "the linear eigenvalue problem for slow pressure modes ( or `` p - modes '' ) is formulated in   3 for a flat barotropic disc , which is axisymmetric in its unperturbed state .",
    "when appropriate boundary conditions are chosen , the eigenvalue equation reduces to a sturm - liouville problem . since the differential operator is self - adjoint , the eigenfrequencies are real : therefore all p - modes are stable , and the eigenfunctions form a complete set of orthogonal functions .",
    "we also map the eigenvalue equation into a schrdinger - like equation , which is useful in the interpretation of our numerical results . in   4 we present numerical results for a variety of discs , namely ( i ) an approximation to the shakura - sunyaev thin disc , ( ii ) the kuzmin disc which is more centrally concentrated , ( iii ) power - law discs .",
    "of particular interest is the nature of the eigenfrequency ; whether it is positive or negative .",
    "this has bearing on the excitation of these modes , because they are stable and will not grow spontaneously through a non - viscous instability .",
    "comparison with earlier work , summary and conclusions follow in   5 .",
    "consider a flat thin disc of fluid orbiting a central mass @xmath8 .",
    "the fluid is assumed to be barotropic and the disc is described by a surface density profile @xmath9 . in our analysis",
    "we ignore viscous forces , assuming that they adjust to maintain a quasi - stationary flow with a small radial velocity , and have little effect on the perturbed flow .",
    "thus , we start with the continuity and euler equations in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the radial and azimuthal components of the fluid velocity , @xmath13 is the enthalpy per unit mass , and @xmath14 is the gravitational potential due to the disc . for a barotropic",
    "fluid with an equation of state given by @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is a constant ) , the isentropic sound speed and enthalpy are given by @xmath17      we assume that the radial velocity of the unperturbed flow is much smaller than the azimuthal velocity and set it identically equal to zero ; this assumption is justified below at the end of   2.2 .",
    "the unperturbed disc is assumed to be axisymmetric , therefore all @xmath18 derivatives are set to zero .",
    "gas flows along circular orbits , with centrifugal balance maintained largely by the gravitational attraction of the central mass ( with small but non trivial contributions from gas pressure and disc self - gravity ) .",
    "the azimuthal and radial frequencies , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , associated with nearly circular orbits are given by @xmath21 where the subscript ` @xmath22 ' indicates unperturbed quantities . the mach number of the flow @xmath23 .",
    "the dominant contribution to both @xmath24 and @xmath25 is due to the central mass , with small corrections coming from the disc self - gravity @xmath26 and enthalpy @xmath27 .",
    "let us define the small parameter @xmath28 as the larger of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the apsides of the nearly circular orbit of a fluid element precesses at a rate given by , @xmath31 note that , in contrast to @xcite , we have retained the contribution from gas pressure ( i.e. enthalpy ) . in fact , in thin accretion discs around compact stars , disc self - gravity is negligible and the contribution to @xmath32 is almost entirely from gas pressure . the goal of this section is to establish that these discs have large - scale slow modes driven only by pressure . in the wkb analysis of linear modes given below",
    "we follow the presentation due to @xcite .",

    "@xcite showed that the dispersion relation for @xmath0 modes can be written as @xmath41    in @xcite it is argued that , when the pressure is negligible compared to disc self - gravity ( i.e. @xmath42 ) , the wkb dispersion relation of equation  ( [ eq : dr ] ) admits large - scale ` @xmath43 ' modes with frequencies @xmath44 .",
    "it may be verified that the condition of negligible pressure implies that the mach number @xmath45 .",
    "however , as we have argued in the introduction , this inequality is violated for thin accretion discs around compact stars where the opposite is true , i.e. @xmath7 . hence we need to consider a situation that is complementary to the analysis of @xcite .",

    "this is the motivation for our studies of the eigenvalue problem for slow modes given below .",
    "henceforth we ignore disc self - gravity altogether and consider only the effect of gas pressure .",
    "we now justify the assumption made at the beginning of   2.1 , that the radial velocity in the unperturbed disc is small , and may be ignored when studying slow modes .",
    "the time scale of radial spreading of the disc is , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the shakura  sunyaev viscosity parameter .",
    "the frequency of a slow mode is @xmath54 .",
    "therefore @xmath55 implies that the radial spreading occurs over many slow mode periods .",

    "this equation is a special case of equation ( 13 ) of @xcite , where @xmath67 , and the external and self gravity perturbations are set equal to zero .",
    "it can be noted that this equation becomes singular at @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the former corresponds to the corotation resonance and the latter corresponds to the lindblad resonances ( lr ) .",
    "below we discuss the validity of equation ( [ eq : gold ] ) at lr ; a similar analysis holds for the singularity at corotation radius but we do not discuss it in this paper since , as is argued later , for the slow modes the corotation radius has to lie outside the disc .",

    "we confine our investigations to free modes of an undriven disc , therefore , as the above discussion shows , nothing special happens at the lr .    *",

    "we obtain @xmath75 similar to equation ( [ eq : gold ] ) , equation ( [ eq : apgold ] ) too is singular at the lindblad resonances , however the singularity at the corotation radius has gone away since this equation has been derived under the slow mode condition , @xmath72 .",

    "therefore , there are no outer lindblad resonance singularities for slow modes",
    ". however , the inner lindblad radius ( ilr ) , where @xmath80 , could very well lie inside the disc . due to the fact that the disc surface density is completely arbitrary , there could in general be more than one ilrs . to make the problem well posed under the slow mode approximation , at the ilrs",
    ", the condition ( [ eq : ilr:1 ] ) reduces to @xmath81 we shall see later that the numerical solutions of equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) satisfy this condition and the velocity amplitude at the ilr remains finite ; thus the linear approximation remains valid and nothing special happens at the ilr .    from equation ( [ eq : pomh ] ) , @xmath82",

    "we shall see in the examples that this condition is comfortably satisfied .",
    "we integrate the eigen equation in the range @xmath114 .",
    "we assume that the perturbations obey the boundary conditions , @xmath115 we note that these boundary conditions make the differential operator in equation  ( [ eq : sl ] ) self - adjoint : therefore the eigenvalues @xmath98 are real , and all slow p - modes are stable .",

    "collecting terms of zeroth order in @xmath120 leads to the dispersion relation @xmath123 which is identical to equation  ( [ eq : drslow ] ) .",
    "however , we find that this dispersion relation , together with the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition of equation  ( [ eq : quant ] ) predicts eigenvalues that compare poorly with those obtained from numerical integration of the sturm - liouville equation .",

    "the solution is oscillatory where @xmath133 , implying @xmath134 , and non - oscillatory otherwise .",
    "since the disc is finite the eigen spectrum is always discrete and there are two distinct types of spectra :    * type i * : this occurs when there is at least one turning point within the disc .",
    "in the case of a single turning point we can have oscillatory solution on either side of the turning point , depending on the form of @xmath130 .",
    "if there are more than one turning point then we could either have oscillatory behaviour confined between the turning points or outside , such as the case of the ss disc discussed below .",
    "* type ii * : this occurs when there are no turning points within the disc and the discreteness of the spectra depends entirely on the size of the disc .    to obtain real eigenvalues we need to consider the possibility of satisfying @xmath133 in a bounded region , which could either be bounded by one or both of the disc boundaries or by turning points .",
    "thus a useful first step is to plot this potential for the problem at hand . if the potential allows regions that can support bound states , we search for solutions numerically , and to verify our results we use the wkb approximation .",

    "the case of positive eigenvalues , @xmath139 , is more interesting .",
    "if the eigenvalue is positive and smaller than the maximum value of @xmath140 , then there are two turning points ( say , @xmath141 with @xmath142 ) separating three distinct regions .",

    "as discussed in the last section , we consider finite disc and we expect the spectra of equation  ( [ eq : sl ] ) to be discrete",
    ". these modes would have observational consequences since they would rotate at a definite frequency around the disc .",
    "the perturbations in the enthalpy would lead to azimuthal variations in the temperature and density across the disc , which might be observable depending on the amplitude of perturbations .    since very little is known about the surface density profiles of the discs we carry out a simplistic calculation based on certain standard forms of the disc as test cases .",
    "we also consider the generic power law profile .",
    "some of the profiles considered below are formally infinite in size , however as noted above , we need to keep the disc finite . this would imply that the surface density would abruptly fall to zero at the outer disc radius .",

    "comparison with fig  ( [ fig5 ] ) shows that the solutions are more radially extended , with well separated peaks . for @xmath200",
    "there is no turning point and the eigenvalues are of type  ii .",
    "we have presented a theory of slow @xmath0 linear pressure modes ( or `` p - modes '' ) in thin accretion discs around massive compact objects , such as white dwarfs and neutron star .",
    "these modes are enabled by the small deviation from a purely keplerian flow , due to fluid pressure rather than disc self - gravity . for simplicity",
    "we have taken the fluid to be barotropic .",
    "our formulation largely follows that of @xcite , although there is a key difference : using the wkb approximation , @xcite argued that fluid discs for which disc self - gravity dominates fluid pressure can support slow modes , if the mach number @xmath3 is much larger than the toomre @xmath4 parameter",
    ". this condition may be satisfied in relatively cool discs , but not for thin accretion discs around white dwarfs or neutron stars . in these discs , @xmath7 , and",
    "the analysis in @xcite does not apply , because disc self - gravity is negligible when compared with fluid pressure in thin accretion discs .",
    "this implies that the precession rate of the apsides @xmath201 of a fluid element in a nearly circular orbit is determined by the fluid pressure ; to order of magnitude , @xmath202 .",
    ".the eigenvalues for the power law model with are tabulated here for comparison between those obtained numerically and those obtained using the wkb approximation .",
    "the columns @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath203 and @xmath204 respectively .",
    "the match between numerical and wkb eigenvalues is within a few per cent , and remains good even for small quantum numbers .",
    "the eigenvalues are not very sensitive to precise value of @xmath205 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      a wkb analysis was used first to argue that thin accretion discs can support large - scale @xmath206 , @xmath0 p - modes with small angular frequencies , @xmath207 . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "these long wavelength modes may dominate the appearance of the disc , and are not expected to be damped by viscosity .",
    "we derived an eigen equation for slow linear modes and showed that it is identical to a sturm - liouville problem .",
    "the differential operator being self - adjoint implies that the eigenvalues are all real , so that all slow p - modes are stable .",
    "this corresponds to the result in @xcite that all slow modes of the softened gravity disc are stable .",
    "we solved the sturm - liouville problem numerically for a variety of unperturbed discs , and summarise our results below .    1 .",
    "the first corresponds to two different kinds of barotropic approximations to the shakura - sunyaev thin disc , which have modes with negative eigenfrequencies .",
    "the second is the kuzmin disc , which is more centrally concentrated .",
    "as earlier , this too supports only negative eigenfrequencies .",
    "power - law discs can support modes with negative eigenfrequencies for reasonable values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for certain combinations of these parameters power law discs can support positive eigenfrequencies as well ; however the range of parameters turn out to be physically uninteresting .",
    "if slow modes are stable , it is necessary to consider how they could be excited .",
    "since they have azimuthal wavenumber @xmath0 , we need look for excitation mechanisms which possess the same symmetry , at least in the linear limit .",
    "one possibility is from the stream of matter from the secondary star that feeds the accretion disc .",
    "when viewed in the rest frame of the primary , the region where the stream meets the outer edge of the disc rotates in a prograde sense with angular frequency equal to the orbital frequency of the binary system .",
    "since the orbital frequency of the binary can be much smaller than the orbital frequency of the gas in the accretion disc , there is the possibility of the resonant excitation of a slow mode if it has positive frequency . in the cases we have considered",
    ", we find only negative frequencies belonging to a discrete spectrum , allowing only for non  resonant driving .",
    "there is , however , another alternative that does not rely on external sources of excitation . @xcite",
    "have studied linear waves in thin accretion discs and applied their theory to slow @xmath0 modes around black holes .",
    "they used the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential of @xcite to model the general relativistic effects due to a schwarzschild black hole . in this case",
    "@xmath32 is due to the deviation of the pseudo - newtonian potential from a kepler potential , so their slow modes are not driven by pressure ( as is true in all the cases we have considered ) ; hence more detailed comparison with our work is not possible .",
    "what is interesting is that they find that their slow modes to have negative energy and angular momentum , and suggest that slow modes may be excited spontaneously through the action of viscous forces .",
    "this possibility should be examined in the context of the p - modes we have studied . however",
    ", this would require reformulating the eigenvalue problem taking into account viscous effects .",
