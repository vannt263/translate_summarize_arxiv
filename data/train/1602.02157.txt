    "the past few years have seen considerable progress in our understanding of the phenomenon of many body localization ( mbl ) which has built on the early@xcite , seminal and rigorous@xcite work that established its existence .",
    "one of the more interesting ideas that has emerged from this work is that of eigenstate phase transitions wherein individual many body eigenstates and/or the eigenspectrum exhibit singular changes in their properties across a parameter boundary even as the standard statistical mechanical averages are perfectly smooth . in recent work @xcite",
    "this idea was generalized to disordered floquet systems taking advantage of the fact that they exhibit generalizations of the notions of eigenstate and eigenvalue in the form of time - periodic floquet eigenstates and associated quasi - energies .",
    "ref .   presented evidence that one dimensional spin chains with ising symmetry exhibit four distinct floquet phases with either paramagnetic or spin glass order  two of the resulting floquet phases have no analogs in undriven systems .",
    "disorder seems to be an essential ingredient in this generalization  if the driving hamiltonians are clean@xcite , or lack sufficiently strong disorder@xcite , the eigenstate properties of periodically driven systems seem to exhibit `` infinite temperature '' ergodic behavior , with no vestige of paramagnetic or spin glass quantum order .    in this paper",
    "we pick up the thread from this point and address the question of obtaining an enumeration of all possible floquet phases in one dimension .",
    "specifically , we restrict ourselves to floquet phases which do _ not _ spontaneously break any symmetry of the drive ; we will analyze the case of broken symmetry in a subsequent paper . in 1d",
    "this implies that we are looking for floquet versions of symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phases of matter , which generalize topological insulators and superconductors to interacting systems .",
    "all spt phases of matter are associated with some global symmetry group @xmath3 , which is not spontaneously broken . given a symmetry group @xmath3 there may be many distinct spt phases , each of which can be distinguished by their ground states  two ground states represent the same spt phase iff they can be connected to one another by a symmetric local unitary .",
    "a complete classification of spts in 1d is available @xcite .",
    "the first step away from the purely ground state classification was taken in refs .   where it was shown that in the presence of localization induced by sufficiently strong disorder , the entire spectrum ( not just the ground state ) of certain spts can carry a signature of the underlying spt order . in 1d",
    "this is the statement that in many - body localized spt systems , the entire spectrum has a characteristic string order .",
    "this idea was clarified recently in ref .  .",
    "on the one hand mbl hamiltonians are believed to be characterized by the appearance of a complete set of local integrals of the motion or @xmath4bits @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that a proper subset of the possible spt orders can be captured by commuting stabilizer hamiltonians , where the @xmath5 are local and commute amongst themselves .",
    "see ref .   for a well explained example of a commuting stabilizer spt hamiltonian , and examples in the main text . ] . ref .   synthesized these observations arguing that only those spt orders captured by commuting stabilizer hamiltonians can have eigenstate order .    in another line of work ,",
    "non - interacting floquet systems have been investigated for non - trivial topology and building on various examples @xcite a classification has recently been obtained @xcite , and also investigated in a disordered setting@xcite .",
    "this classification is indeed richer than for the undriven problem . as ref",
    ".   shows , if the original equilibrium non - interacting classification was @xmath6@xcite , then the floquet classification is of form @xmath7 .    here",
    "we will show that the classification of symmetric floquet states is different from both the undriven mbl spt classification _ and _ the non - interacting floquet classification ; a simple example is given by the @xmath8 bosonic spt considered in detail in .",
    "our general approach is as follows .",
    "we start with a floquet drive with associated floquet unitary @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 has a prescribed eigenstate order which we call the bulk order ( measured by a string order parameter for unitary @xmath3 , and encoded in the form of the local conserved quantities ) . to focus on those floquet systems potentially resilient against heating to `` infinite temperature ''",
    ", we consider only those bulk orders which are many - body localizable in the sense of ref .    in practice , this means we restrict ourselves to states with on - site symmetry groups @xmath3 .",
    "we make a further simplification by assuming @xmath3 is abelian .    in the undriven",
    "setting , the classification of 1d spt eigenstate order is captured by how the symmetries in the problem act projectively at the edge@xcite , this being captured almost entirely by a so - called 2-cocycle @xmath11 .",
    "we conjecture that in the driven mbl setting in addition to this information there is just one further piece of data @xmath12 characterizing the commutation between the symmetry action local to the edges and the floquet unitary @xmath13 itself . for unitary symmetries ,",
    "we show that this @xmath14 is a 1d representation of @xmath3 .",
    "for anti - unitary symmetry groups of form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is unitary and @xmath17 is @xmath18 time reversal , our results are less certain , but we conjecture that @xmath14 obeys a twisted 1-cocycle condition . in any case , the set of all such @xmath14 is denoted @xmath2 .",
    "hence our proposed interacting classification for floquet drives is of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the undriven classification .",
    "a compatible set of results was obtained independently shortly after the appearance of the present work in refs .  .",
    "to support our conjecture we investigate in more detail the structure of local symmetric floquet unitaries with a complete set of local bulk integrals of motion . on an open chain",
    ", we argue that such a unitary can be brought into a form @xmath21 where @xmath22 are local to the left / right end of the system and both commute with @xmath23 , a local functional of the local bulk conserved quantities characterizing the bulk order .",
    "we formulate @xmath14 in terms of @xmath22 , and show that it is robust under arbitrarily large but symmetric modifications to the floquet drive local to the edges as well as small symmetric perturbations to the bulk .",
    "the balance of the paper is set out as follows .",
    "we start in with a 1d floquet system with class d ( fermion parity protected ) kitaev chain eigenstate order .",
    "we use a novel framework to reproduce the @xmath24 classification obtained from band theory , and verified in an interacting setting in ref .  .",
    "this helps us to motivate a more general framework in .",
    "then in we reinterpret our results more simply as an extension of the undriven algebraic classification of ref .  .",
    "in we examine the spectrum of the interacting bosonic @xmath25 drive , explaining what kinds of edge modes are present . in we deal separately with two examples of time reversal invariant spts , the latter being an interacting driven version of fermionic class bdi . we conclude in .",
    ", while the string order operator for the topological phase ( c ) involves a product of bond fermion parity operators @xmath26 .",
    "]     summarize the protected multiplets in the spectrum for an open chain e.g. , in the @xmath27 trivial phase , if there is a state with @xmath28 eigenvalues @xmath29 then there are guaranteed to be states at @xmath30 up to exponential corrections . ]",
    "we will now consider in some detail a particular case that will explain the logic we follow in the general case .",
    "this is the case of floquet drives defined by fermionic hamiltonians @xmath31 which conserve fermion parity . for quadratic time",
    "independent hamiltonians this is class d in the altland - zirnbauer classification .",
    "we will use the same nomenclature for our interacting time dependent problem .",
    "for the non - interacting floquet problem the list of phases for class d is known and we will explain how this exhausts the list of phases in the interacting mbl setting as well ; we note that previous work @xcite has shown by explicit computation that the non - interacting phases do continue into this setting but not settled the question of whether others exist .",
    "we now , successively , review the basics of the time independent quadratic classification , its floquet analog and an understanding of the latter appropriate to the mbl setting and end with the promised generalization to interacting mbl floquet systems .",
    "there are just two spts with just @xmath32 fermion parity symmetry in 1d@xcite .",
    "they have model hamiltonians    @xmath33    where the hilbert space consists of @xmath34 spinless fermion degrees of freedom @xmath35 , or equivalently two @xmath36 majorana fermion degrees of freedom per site defined by @xmath37 .",
    "if we choose the @xmath38 to be translationally invariant then @xmath39 encode the well known kitaev trivial / topological 1d wire fixed point states .",
    "hamiltonians in the same phase as @xmath40 are called topological because they are associated with an ( exponentially ) protected spectral pairing on an open system associated with a protected majorana mode at its edge . concretely , for",
    "@xmath41 presented above , we can find simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath41 and fermion parity @xmath42 .",
    "the operator @xmath43 commutes with @xmath41 but anti - commutes with @xmath44 .",
    "hence each energy eigenvalue @xmath45 of @xmath46 is associated with at least two states @xmath47 with fermion parity @xmath48 respectively .",
    "@xmath49 , the trivial state , has no such protected degeneracies .",
    "another way to distinguish the ground states of the trivial / topological phases is through the use of string order parameters .",
    "that is , if we define [ eq : classdstringorder ] _",
    "l , r^(c)=    _ l < s < ri_s _ s & c=0 + i_l _ r & c=1    then @xmath50 is long - ranged / exponentially decaying in the trivial / topological phases respectively , and @xmath51 is long - ranged / exponentially decaying in the topological / trivial phases respectively ( see ref .   for an illuminating account of string order in 1d spts ) .",
    "we will thus refer to the trivial / topological states as having type @xmath52 string orders respectively .",
    "if we choose @xmath38 strongly disordered _ all of the eigenstates _ of @xmath39 necessarily have string order of types @xmath52 respectively , and this statement is at least perturbatively stable to the inclusion of interactions@xcite .",
    "there are four known phases of the class d floquet problem .",
    "following ref .",
    "we can exhibit them in a simple model of a binary floquet drive ( see also ref .  )",
    "using the reference hamiltonians @xmath39 @xmath53 where we pick @xmath54 to be uniform .",
    "eventually we will disorder these couplings , but we assume uniformity for now for ease of exposition .",
    "the final floquet unitary is simply @xmath55    the phase diagram of our binary drive as a function of @xmath56 has some manifest periodicities .",
    "note that @xmath57 whence the replacement @xmath58 shifts all quasi - energies by @xmath59 but otherwise the floquet eigenstate properties remain unchanged .",
    "the same holds true for shifts like @xmath60 .",
    "hence the eigenstate properties of @xmath13 are invariant under @xmath61 .",
    "another thing to note is that for systems with an even number of sites the unitary @xmath62 effectively flips @xmath63 while @xmath64 flips @xmath65 .",
    "therefore the eigenstate properties of @xmath13 are also invariant under such inversions and reflections in @xmath66 . from this combination of shift and reflection symmetries in @xmath67",
    ", it suffices to consider a unit cell of the phase diagram @xmath68 $ ] as shown in .",
    "the phase transition lines drawn in the diagram are straightforwardly obtained by diagonalizing @xmath69 for closed chains where each individual momentum sector only presents a two dimensional problem .",
    "of these , the boundary at small @xmath70 , can be obtained by using the bch formula to show that @xmath71 . in this regime ,",
    "the eigenstates are determined by the effective hamiltonian @xmath72 , which is expected to be fully trivial / topological for @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "we will now develop an analytical , spatially local , picture of this phase diagram , which in turn will guide our attempt to classify 1d floquet phases  we do this by focusing on the boundaries of the fundamental region where the floquet unitaries will exhibit localization even absent disorder . in the regions labelled ` triv ' , representative unitaries are obtained by setting @xmath75 i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "it is clear that the eigenstate properties of these unitaries are simply those of the trivial hamiltonian @xmath77 and _ all _ of the eigenstates have @xmath78 string order .",
    "this is clearly a consequence of the ( trivial ) localization of @xmath77 . in the region",
    "labelled ` top ' , representative unitaries are obtained by setting @xmath79 i.e. , @xmath80 , so the eigenstate properties of these are simply those of the topological hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "all of the eigenstates have @xmath81 string order and on an open system , this drive will have a protected majorana at its edges commuting with @xmath13 , and a spectral pairing associated with this majorana .",
    "the @xmath82 topological phase is new to the driven setting .",
    "as an example , set @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xmath85 this is simply the unitary associated with a topological drive ( discussed above ) multiplied by the global fermion parity operator which is itself a good quantum number of @xmath40 .",
    "there is a complete basis of eigenstates with @xmath81 topological string order , which follows from the fact they have local integrals of the motion of form @xmath26 .",
    "now , rewrite @xmath13 in terms of said local integrals of the motion to obtain @xmath86 this unitary looks like the topological drive above ( with @xmath87 shifted ) , multiplied by a term @xmath88 which commutes with the bulk local integrals of motion .",
    "thus we can diagonalize the bulk unitary @xmath89 and the edge unitary @xmath90 simultaneously , writing eigenvalues of @xmath13 as @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the eigenvalues of the bulk and edge unitaries respectively .",
    "note that @xmath93 anti - commutes with @xmath94 and commutes with the bulk unitary . hence if @xmath95 is an eigenvalue of @xmath13 then so is @xmath96 .",
    "in other words if @xmath97 then @xmath98 has eigenvalue @xmath99 . this @xmath82 shift symmetry in the argument of @xmath100 associated with the boundary majoranas",
    "is the reason we call this state the @xmath82 topological state .    in summary",
    ", we identified the eigenstate order of the drive , wrote the unitary in terms of the corresponding local integrals of motion .",
    "the resulting unitary looked like a simple topological drive @xmath89 multiplied by a term @xmath101 which hops majoranas between the distant edges .",
    "this implied a spectral pairing at quasi - energy @xmath82 .",
    "we can treat the @xmath102 phase analogously . on the boundary of that region ,",
    "the eigenstates have type @xmath103 ( trivial ) string order and at a given edge , there is a @xmath103 and a @xmath82 quasi - energy majorana mode . to see this , set @xmath104 and @xmath105 . the resulting unitary simplifies to @xmath106 in the last line we used a local symmetric unitary change of basis ( implemented by @xmath107 ) .",
    "note that the on - site fermion parities @xmath108 are local integrals of motion in the bulk ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "as in the previous example , we use these local integrals of motion to re - express the unitary as u_f i _ 1 _",
    "n e^- i ( t_0+/2 ) ^n-1_s=2 i_s _ s this looks like a bulk non - topological drive multiplied by a majorana tunneling operator @xmath110 .",
    "note that the edge degrees of freedom are completely decoupled from the bulk so we can simultaneously diagonalize the bulk @xmath111 unitary and the two site edge unitary @xmath112 note that the two boundary sites @xmath113 involve the _ four _ majoranas @xmath114 .",
    "this two - site unitary has two useful independent integrals of motion @xmath115 and @xmath116  note these are also integrals of motion of the original unitary @xmath13 as well . picking a reference eigenstate @xmath117 of @xmath118 for the two site problem , we can toggle between the four eigenstates of @xmath94 as shown in .",
    ".eigenstates of the unitary @xmath94 involving sites @xmath113 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "given a symmetry group of the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the time reversal symmetry group with @xmath18 , and @xmath16 is some unitary symmetry group , we wish to find all @xmath121 obeying [ eq : twisted1dapp ] ( gh)= ( g)^(h ) ( h)^(g ) . with @xmath122 .",
    "in particular , note that @xmath123 so that @xmath124 . note that for any @xmath125 @xmath126 hence , restricted to @xmath16 , @xmath14 is just some 1d representation @xmath127 of @xmath16 .",
