    "we study point - to - point block fading channels , depicted in figure  [ fig : sysmdl ] , in the presence of a hybrid adversary .",
    "the hybrid half - duplex adversary can choose to either eavesdrop or jam the transmitter - receiver channel , but not both at a given block .",
    "the goal of the transmitter is to communicate a message reliably to the receiver while keeping it asymptotically secret from the hybrid adversary . during the communication ,",
    "the state of the adversary ( jamming or eavesdropping ) changes in an _ arbitrary _ manner from one block to the next and is _ unknown _ to the transmitter .",
    "we further assume that the transmitter has _ no channel state information _",
    "( csi ) of the transmitter - to - receiver channel ( main channel ) , the transmitter - to - adversary channel ( eavesdropper channel ) and the adversary - to - receiver channel ( jamming channel ) .",
    "the receiver has perfect causal csi of the main and jamming channels .",
    "we study the secrecy capacity of this setting when ( i ) there is no receiver - to - transmitter feedback , and ( ii ) there is @xmath0-bit of receiver - to - transmitter feedback sent at the _ end of each block_. the main challenge in our problem stems from the fact that simultaneously maintaining reliability and secrecy is difficult because of the adversary s arbitrary strategy in choosing its state , i.e. , jamming or eavesdropping , at each block . if we design a scheme focusing on a particular adversary strategy , with a slight change in that particular strategy , the adversary can cause a decoding error or a secrecy leakage .",
    "for instance , if our scheme assumes a fully eavesdropping adversary , then jamming even in a small fraction of the time will lead to a decoding error . likewise ,",
    "if the scheme is designed against a full jammer , then the adversary will lead to a secrecy leakage even it eavesdrops for a small fraction of time . a robust scheme",
    "should take into account the entire set of adversary strategies to maintain reliability and secrecy .",
    "our technical contributions are summarized as follows :    * we show that the secrecy capacity is zero when the receiver feedback is not available and the eavesdropper channel stochastically dominates the _ effective _ main channel gain .",
    "however , we also show that even one bit of receiver feedback at the end of each block is sufficient to make the secrecy capacity positive for almost all possible channel distributions .",
    "* under an arbitrary adversarial strategy , the receiver can not employ a well known typical set decoder @xcite since it can not assume a certain distribution for the received signal . to that end",
    ", we propose a receiver strategy in which the receiver generates artificial noise and adds it to the received signal ( i.e. , jams itself to involve typical set decoding @xcite ) .",
    "we show special cases in which artificial noise generation at the receiver is an optimal way to achieve the secrecy capacity .",
    "* for the 1-bit receiver feedback case , we propose a proof technique for the equivocation analysis , that is based on renewal theory . by this technique",
    ", we can improve the existing achievable secrecy rates in @xcite , which focus on passive eavesdropping attacks only . note that our adversary model covers the possibility of a full eavesdropping attack as well since it allows for the adversary to eavesdrop ( or jam ) for an arbitrary fraction of the time .",
    "* we bound the secrecy capacity when there are multiple hybrid adversaries .",
    "the challenge in bounding the secrecy capacity for multiple adversaries scenario stems from the fact that , when an adversary jams the legitimate receiver , it also interferes to the other adversaries as well .",
    "however , we show that the impact of the interference of one adversary to another adversary does not appear in the bounds , which results in a tighter upper bound .",
    "furthermore , the bounds we provide are valid for the cases in which the adversaries collude or do not collude . in the non - colluding case ,",
    "we show that the secrecy capacity bounds are determined by the adversary that has the strongest eavesdropper channel .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned set - up , we also consider a delay limited communication in which a message of fixed size arrives at the encoder at the beginning of each block , and it needs to be transmitted reliably and securely by the end of that particular block .",
    "otherwise , _ secrecy outage _ occurs at that block .",
    "we analyze delay limited capacity subject to a secrecy outage constraint .",
    "we employ a time sharing strategy in which we utilize a portion of each block to generate secret key bits and use these key bits as a supplement to secure the delay sensitive messages that are transmitted in the other portion of each block .",
    "our scheme achieves positive delay limited secrecy rates whenever the secrecy capacity without any delay constraint is positive .",
    "the wiretap channel , introduced by wyner  @xcite , models information theoretically secure message transmission in a point - to - point setting , where a passive adversary eavesdrops the communication between two legitimate nodes by wiretapping the legitimate receiver .",
    "while attempting to decipher the message , no limit is imposed on the computational resources available to the eavesdropper .",
    "this assumption led to defining ( weak ) secrecy capacity as the maximum achievable rate subject to zero mutual information rate between the transmitted message and the signal received by the adversary .",
    "this work was later generalized to the non - degraded scenario  @xcite and the gaussian channel  @xcite . by exploiting the stochasticity and the asymmetry of wireless channels , the recent works  @xcite extended the results in @xcite to a variety of scenarios involving fading channels .",
    "however , all of the mentioned works consider a passive adversary that can only eavesdrop .",
    "there is a recent research interest on hybrid adversaries that can either jam or eavesdrop @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors formulate the wiretap channel as a two player zero - sum game in which the payoff function is an achievable ergodic secrecy rate .",
    "the strategy of the transmitter is to send the message in a full power or to utilize some of the available power to produce artificial noise .",
    "the conditions under which pure nash equilibrium exists are studied . in  @xcite , the authors consider fast fading main and eavesdropper channels and a static jammer channel , where the adversary follows an ergodic strategy such that it jams or eavesdrop with a certain probability in each channel use . under this configuration",
    ", they propose a novel encoding scheme , called block - markov wyner secrecy encoding . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors introduce a pilot contamination attack in which the adversary jams during the reverse training phase to prevent the transmitter from estimating the channel state correctly .",
    "the authors show the impact of the pilot contamination attack on the secrecy performance .",
    "note that , neither of these works consider an adversary that has an _ arbitrary strategy _ to either jam or eavesdrop , which is the focus of this paper .",
    "channels under arbitrary jamming ( but no eavesdropping ) strategies have been studied in the context of arbitrary varying channel ( avc ) .",
    "avc , the concept of which is introduced in  @xcite , is defined to be the communication channel the statistics of which change in an arbitrary and unknown manner during the transmission of information . in  @xcite , the authors derive the capacity for gaussian avcs , memoryless gaussian channels disrupted by a jamming signal that changes arbitrarily with unknown statistics . an extensive treatment of avcs , outlining the challenges and existing approaches can be found in  @xcite .",
    "recently , discrete memoryless avcs with a secrecy constraint and no receiver feedback have been studied in @xcite @xcite , where the states of the channels to the both receiver and the eavesdropper remain unknown to the legitimate pair and change in an arbitrary manner under the control of the adversary .",
    "the achievable secrecy rates they propose are zero when the worst possible transmitter - to - receiver channel is a degraded version of the best possible transmitter - to - adversary channel . on the other hand , in addition to the jamming signal of the adversary , we consider the fading channels whose states can not be completely controlled by the adversary .",
    "we show the _ secrecy capacity _ is zero when the main channel gain is stochastically dominated by the eavesdropper channel gain .",
    "furthermore , under arbitrarily small receiver feedback rate ( 1-bit at the end of each block ) , we show that the secrecy capacity is _ non - zero_.    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ chap :",

    "the actions of the adversary is parametrized by the state , @xmath2 of a switch , shown in figure  [ fig : sysmdl ] .",

    "<S> we consider a block fading wiretap channel , where a transmitter attempts to send messages securely to a receiver in the presence of a hybrid half - duplex adversary , which arbitrarily decides to either jam or eavesdrop the transmitter - to - receiver channel . </S>",
    "<S> we provide bounds to the secrecy capacity for various possibilities on receiver feedback and show special cases where the bounds are tight . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , without any feedback from the receiver , the secrecy capacity is zero if the transmitter - to - adversary channel stochastically dominates the _ effective _ transmitter - to - receiver channel . however , the secrecy capacity is non - zero even when the receiver is allowed to feed back only one bit at the end of each block . </S>",
    "<S> our novel achievable strategy improves the rates proposed in the literature for the non - hybrid adversarial model . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the effect of multiple adversaries and delay constraints on the secrecy capacity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our novel time sharing approach leads to positive secrecy rates even under strict delay constraints . </S>"
