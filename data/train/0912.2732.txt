    "the basic physical model for radio lobes in frii radio galaxies is based on a pair of relativistic , collimated jets emerging from the active black hole ( bh ) . as the jet interacts with and",
    "is decelerated by the ambient ( interstellar or intergalactic ) medium , a reverse shock propagates inwards into the ejected plasma . after crossing the reverse shock",
    ", the jet material inflates a cocoon of hot gas , which is less dense but much overpressured with respect to the undisturbed medium .",
    "thus , the cocoon expands supersonically , driving a forward shock ( bow shock ) into the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "the cocoon and lobes are the main sources of optically - thin ( steep spectrum ) synchrotron radio emission , while we expect optically - thick ( flat - spectrum ) radio emission from the jet near the core .",
    "a radio- and sometimes x - ray - luminous hot spot is usually found at the reverse shock , at the end of the jet .",
    "this is where most of the bulk kinetic energy of the jet is transferred to a non - thermal population of ultra - relativistic electrons , which cool via synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton emission .",
    "this scenario implies that the peaks of the radio and x - ray emission are spatially coincident .",
    "optically - thin thermal plasma x - ray emission may come instead from the hot , shocked ambient gas in the thin layer between the cocoon and the bow shock , when its expansion is highly supersonic . in this case",
    ", the peak of the thermal x - ray emission will appear just in front of the radio lobe , as is the case for example in the nearest radio galaxy , cen a @xcite .",
    "there is a scale invariance between the jet emission processes in microquasars ( powered by stellar - mass bhs ) and in agn / quasars ( powered by supermassive bhs ) .",
    "there is also at least one important difference : microquasars are mostly located in a relatively low - pressure medium as compared to the medium around agn , when scaling of the jet thrust is taken into account @xcite . as a consequence , we expect to see fewer , dimmer cocoons and radio lobes in microquasars than in the most powerful agn and quasars ; but the linear size of those microquasar cocoons and jets can be up to 1000 times larger than in radio galaxies , scaled to their respective bh masses .",
    "so far , our knowledge of the interaction of microquasar jets with the interstellar medium has largely relied on the galactic microquasar ss433 and its surrounding synchrotron - emitting nebula w50 ( size @xmath7 pc ) .",
    "a mildly relativistic ( @xmath8 ) , precessing jet acts as a sprinkler that inflates `` ear - like '' structures , protruding from the more spherical w50 nebula .",
    "most of the jet power ( @xmath9@xmath10 erg s@xmath5 ) is dissipated in those lobes @xcite .",
    "faint evidence of the interaction of relativistic jets with the interstellar medium have been found in a few other , less powerful galactic microquasars ( e.g. , cyg x-1 : @xcite ; cyg x-3 : @xcite ; grs1915@xmath11105 : @xcite ) . on a larger scale , huge ( size @xmath12 pc ) ionized nebulae have been found around a significant fraction of ultraluminous x - ray sources in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "such nebulae emit optical lines typical of shock - ionized gas , and in a few cases , synchrotron radio emission @xcite .",
    "the derived ages ( @xmath13 a few @xmath14 yrs ) and energy content ( @xmath15@xmath16 erg ) are too large for ordinary supernova remnants , and suggest jet / wind inflation with a mechanical power @xmath9@xmath10 erg s@xmath5 , comparable with the x - ray luminosities @xcite . however , no direct x - ray or radio evidence of a collimated jet had been found , until recently .    .",
