    "in the regime of high energy scattering , where the center of mass energy is larger than any other available scale , perturbative approach to processes with high momentum transfer allows factorization of the cross section into a hard matrix element with initial off - shell gluons and an unintegrated gluon density  @xcite . the unintegrated gluon density is a function of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 and transverse momentum @xmath1 of a gluon . after taking into account formally subleading corrections coming from coherence of gluon emissions one is lead to the ccfm equation which introduces gluon density dependent on hard scale related to probe . in principle",
    ", it is an equation that should be the ideal framework for application to final states at high energies and covering dglap and bfkl domain in gluon channel .",
    "it has been implemented in the monte carlo event generator @xcite .",
    "however , so far good agreement with high precision data has been successfully achieved only in rather inclusive processes like @xmath2 and drell - yan @xcite .",
    "it is known that on the theory side the ccfm physics is still to be completed .",
    "for instance : the impact of the kinematical effects introducing energy conservation in the ccfm evolution have been not investigated in all detail .",
    "as it turns out from our study it is necessary to revisit the inclusion of the so called kinematical constraint  @xcite into ccfm equation .",
    "only recently the ccfm has been promoted to non - linear equation  @xcite therefore allowing for the possibility to investigate interplay of coherence effects and saturation @xcite . in particular",
    "the important question is what is the role of the angular ordering and kinematical effect in the evolution at the non - linear level .",
    "the optimal form of initial conditions is also not known .",
    "we present here a continuation of the work done in  @xcite .",
    "the ccfm equation for gluon density reads : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and the modulus of two dimensional vectors transversal to the collision plane are denoted @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 is gluon s longitudinal momentum fraction and @xmath7 .",
    "also the rescaled momentum is introduced as @xmath8 .",
    "+ where @xmath9 is the gluon splitting function .",
    "the function @xmath10 is the sudakov form - factor .",
    "the non - sudakov form - factor @xmath11 regularizes @xmath12 singularity .      the integration over @xmath13 in the equation  , although being constrained from below by the soft cut - off @xmath14 , is not constrained by an upper limit thus violating the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "moreover in the low @xmath0 formalism one requires that in the denominator of the off - shell gluon propagator one keeps terms that obey @xmath15 . in order to be consistent",
    "the non - sudakov form - factor should be accompanied by a kinematical constrained limiting the above integration over @xmath16 .",
    "in approximated form it reads @xmath17 and at @xmath18 guaranties that @xmath19 . in @xcite",
    "it has been extended to region including also the case when @xmath20 .",
    "careful derivation leads to following form of the kinematical constraint @xmath21 .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath22 results in the upper bound on @xmath23 providing local condition for energy - momentum conservation .",
    "we include the kinematical constraint in the ccfm equation .",
    "the non - sudakov form - factor after inclusion of the full form of the kinematical constraint assumes form @xmath24 please note the presence of the function @xmath25 .",
    "the authors of @xcite solve the ccfm at small @xmath26 limit therefore the function @xmath25 is neglected and in most of the phenomenological and theoretical applications of the ccfm this term is neglected @xcite .",
    "the following form of non - sudakov form factor is usually being used : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , if @xmath29 ; @xmath30 , if @xmath31 ; @xmath32 , if @xmath33 .",
    "the discussed above @xmath34-function is not taken into account .      to account for gluon recombination at large gluon densities",
    "the ccfm equation has been promoted to non - linear equation by including a quadratic term @xcite and it reads :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and we included the kinematical constraint of the form in the kernel .",
    "simpler versions of the equation above have been already analyzed in  @xcite and it has been observed , that the equation leads to phenomenon called saturation at the saturation scale @xcite and the saturation strongly suppresses the gluon density at low @xmath0 and low @xmath37 .",
    "the natural question arises how are these results modified when some of the approximations are not taken and how are they modified if the kinematical effect is imposed in the full form .",
    "( 30,0 ) ( 5 , -105 )    ( 189 , -105 )    ( 30,0 ) (-8 , -105 )    ( 174 , -105 )      we use an initial condition which includes resummed virtual and unresolved contributions , according to  @xcite and  @xcite , in the form @xmath38 , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the regge form - factor .    the observation we make from the plots ( like plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots1d-2 ] ) is that the solutions of equations we study differ significantly .",
    "the solutions exhibit also similar features . solutions of both versions of the kernel with kinematical constraint exhibit a local maximum as functions of @xmath37 and @xmath41 . the positions of local maxima in the plots of @xmath41 dependence are correlated with the value of @xmath37 , with a shift to higher @xmath37 for the solution of the equation with kinematical constrain @xmath34-function included . the peak can be explained by the fact that the contribution of the integral on the right hand side of the equaiton peaks at around @xmath42 .",
    "the peak therefore is a result of presence of @xmath43  angular ordering condition .",
    "similar peaks are present also in the plots of @xmath37 dependence and resemble sudakov suppression of @xmath37 scales of the order of @xmath41  @xcite . however , in the case of without the @xmath34-function it seems , that the position of the peak does not depend on the value of @xmath41 .",
    "the peak observed in solution of the equation without kinematical constrain @xmath34-function is hidden under the result of the evolution .",
    "we can conclude that the peak in the @xmath37 dependence is an interplay result of inclusion of the explicit kinematical contraint via @xmath34-function factor and the sudakov effect .",
    "we set the parameter characterizing the strength of the non - linear term @xmath44 the value @xmath45gev in the equation  . by comparing the ccfm and kgbjs equations we see ,",
    "that the kinematical constraint suppresses the growth of the gluon so much that the non - linear effects enter only at very low @xmath0 .",
    "observations made in previous paragraphs are confirmed in 2-dimensional plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plots2d-2 ] ) , where we plot absolute relative difference of two amplitudes , solutions of the ccfm and kgbjs equations , defined by the quantity @xmath46 the function @xmath47 , introduced before in  @xcite , can be used to measure the strength of the non - linear effects and to define a saturation scale using the conditions : @xmath48 the second condition in   defines @xmath41-related saturation scale .",
    "the conditions above can be seen as equipotential lines in the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots2d-2 ] , where different equipotential lines correspond to different constants on the right - hand side of the equation above . the change in the slope of the @xmath49 at around @xmath50 reported in  @xcite ,",
    "can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots2d-2 ] , can be understood in the context of the peak at @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plots1d-2 ] ) .    by comparing the plots fig .",
    "[ fig : plots2d-2 ] to analogous plots in @xcite we see that the main features are very similar .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath52 approximation of the kgbjs and ccfm equations taken in @xcite does not , at least , modify the relative difference between linear and non - linear equation .",
