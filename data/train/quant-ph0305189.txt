    "later , hunter and wadlinger @xcite proposed the single - slit diffraction experiment in order to measure the diameter of the photon .    in order to investigate the reasons of unobservability of quantum effects in the classical world arndt et al .",

    "@xcite performed quantum interference experiments with objects of large mass and diameter , including macromolecules .",

    "are there new effects applying to particles bigger than their de broglie wavelength ?",
    "\\2 ) does internal structure have influence on interference ?",
    "arndt et .",
    "al .  emphasized the task @xcite : `` here we report the observation of de broglie wave interference of @xmath0 molecules by diffraction at a material absorption grating .",
    "this molecule is the most massive and complex object in which wave behavior has been observed .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that @xmath0 is almost a classical body , because of its many excited internal degrees of freedom ... '' .",
    "\\3 ) what happened with an ensemble of incoming particles if slits are smaller than the diameter of the particles ?    in the experiment of arndt et .",
    "the de broglie wavelength of the interfering fullerenes is already smaller than their diameter by a factor of almost @xmath1 and authors pointed out that `` it would be certainly interesting to investigate the interference of objects the size of which is equal or even bigger than the diffracting structure '' @xcite .",
    "these experiments could shed more light on a long standing dilema whether each quanton consists of a particle and accompanied wave ( as two different compatible entities ) @xcite , or quantons sometimes behave like a wave and sometimes behave like a particle ( obeying principle of complementarity ) @xcite ?",
    "the following citations illustrate the present situation .",
    "`` we performed an experiment which was proposed by ghose , home and agarwal showing both classical wave - like and particle - like behaviors of single photon states of light in a single experiment , in conformity with quantum optics . '' @xcite .",
    "`` here we give a detailed justification of our claim that this experimental results contradict the tenet of mutual exclusiveness of classical wave and particle pictures assumed in bohr s complementarity principle . ''",
    "`` simultaneous observations of wave and particle behavior is prohibited '' @xcite .    ``",
    "although interference patterns were once thought of as evidence for wave motion , when looked at in detail it can be seen that the electron arrive in individual lumps . ... we must therefore conclude that electrons show wave - like interference in their arrival pattern despite the fact that they arrive in lumps just like bullets '' .",
    "@xcite    `` it is frequently said or implied that the wave - particle duality of matter embodies the notion that a particle  the electron , for example  propagates like a wave , but registers at a detector like a particle . here",
    "one must again exercise care in expression so that what is already intrinsically difficult to understand is not made more so by semantic confusion .",
    "the manifestations of wave - like behavior are statistical in nature and _ always _ emerge from the collective outcome of many electron events ... that electrons behave singly as particles and collectively as waves is indeed mysterious , ... ''",
    "@xcite    `` each atom is therefore at the same time a particle and a wave , the wave allowing one to get the probability to observe the particle at a given place . ''",
    "@xcite     ... ever since then the two sides of the same quantum object appeared together : on the one hand the non - local wave nature needed to describe the unperturbed propagation and on the other hand the local aspect of the object when it is registered by the detector \" @xcite    in this paper we present the theoretical study of the dependence of the quantum interference pattern on the diameter of the particle , assuming that the characteristic sizes of the diffraction structure are of the order of the diameter of the particle .",
    "we argue that an asymmetric double - slit interferometer ( an interferometer whose slits have different widths @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) is the generic case for this study .",
    "we shall now determine , the wave function of a quanton which travels with velocity , @xmath4 through the region i , towards the slits and is then sent through the slits to the region ii ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "results in this section are valid for arbitrary slits .",

    "far enough from the slits wave function resembles the fourier transform of the wave field accross the aperture .",
    "this can be verified from the fresnel - kirchhoff solution . in the far region",
    "it follows : @xmath25 wave function is now separable into two functions , one depending on @xmath26 and the other depending on @xmath27 @xcite : @xmath28    the solution of equation ( [ statschr ] ) in region ii can be written in another form @xcite .",
    "this form is more convenient for our analysis than the form ( [ fksol ] ) . with approximation valid for small diffraction angles",

    "in fact , for each value of @xmath45 , in the far field there exists the straight line with origin at the center of the grating along which this particular value of @xmath45 propagates .",
    "by assuming that the motion of an atom along the @xmath26-axis may be treated classically and that the transverse motion is quantum , one is tempted to use the relation @xmath46 and to determine the time dependent function of the transverse motion @xmath47 from the function @xmath48 , by the following definition : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "we see that the function @xmath47 has the form of a general solution of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "the wave function @xmath31 is then seen as a wave function of this one - dimensional ( transverse ) motion in the momentum representation .",

    "the slit width is often equal or up to ten times smaller than the distance between the slits . in quantum interference experiments with electrons and neutrons",

    "but , depending on the velocity , atoms may have de broglie wavelength which is smaller than the diameter of the atom . with macromolecules",
    "such a situation encounters more often , as shown in the experiment of arndt et .",

    "a study of a quantum particle in an asymmetric double - slit interferometer ( @xmath82 ) seems to be useful for this purpose because we identify two characteristic cases for the ratio of slit widths @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the diameter of the particle @xmath81 :    _ a _ ) the diameter @xmath81 is negligeable with respect to the widths @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "we know that the diameter of the particle is not incorporated anywhere in the schrdinger equation .",
    "but , we expect that a particle with diameter @xmath81 , such that @xmath88 could not pass through the second slit .",
    "so , it seems to us that we are forced to assume that wave functions in the coordinate and momentum representation in the case _ b _ ) is also given by expressions ( [ ift])-([cktwo ] ) .",
    "the momentum distribution @xmath51 of particles is given also by ( [ cdefd ] ) , because it is determined by the values of the wave function at the boundary .",
    "but the space distribution of particles in case _ b _ ) is different from the space distribution in case _ a _ ) , because the particles arriving to the smaller slit can not go through .",
