    "the strong short - range and tensor component in realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions induces correlations in the nuclear many - body wave functions that can not be accounted for in an independent - particle approximation as for example adopted in the hartree - fock ( hf ) model . over the years , various models that aim at going beyound the independent - particle model ( ipm ) wave functions , including effects of short - range and tensor correlations ,",
    "have been proposed @xcite . despite the strongness of the tensor and short - range force it turns out to be a very challenging task to determine the proper measurable quantities that can verify the realistic character of those models .",
    "cross sections for pion double - charge exchange reactions @xmath3a(@xmath4,@xmath5)@xmath6a have been shown to exhibit some sensitivity to dynamical short - range correlations ( src ) but can not yet distinguish between the different model predictions @xcite .",
    "better conditions to study the effects of correlations are predicted for reactions induced by leptonic probes .",
    "in contrast to pion - induced reactions , the data are not contaminated by effects related to initial - state interactions and the whole nuclear volume , including the interior , is sampled .",
    "it is believed that with the advent of a new generation of high - duty cycle electron facilities in the intermediate energy range ( @xmath7  gev ) good conditions have been created to explore the dynamics of ground - state correlations with unprecedented precision .",
    "a key function in the study of ground - state correlations in nuclei is the single - particle spectral function @xmath8 that gives the probability to remove a nucleon with momentum @xmath9 and find the residual a-1 system at an energy @xmath10 .",
    "the most dramatic effects of the short - range and tensor correlations on @xmath8 are predicted to occur at high momentum and energy @xcite .",
    "one should realize , however , that these parts of the spectral function belong to the smaller probability components in the nuclear wave functions . as a consequence ,",
    "signals of ground - state correlations are likely to produce relatively small cross sections .",
    "this puts heavy constraints on the experimental requirements when performing measurements that aim at probing those correlations .",
    "moreover , when exploring the small components in the nuclear wave functions one should start worrying about the role of competing mechanisms that could blur their effects in the actual cross sections . in this respect",
    "it is worth mentioning that the frequently quoted relation between the ( e , e@xmath0p ) cross section and the single - particle spectral function is based on rather severe assumptions regarding the reaction mechanism . apart from the neglect of any sort of final - state interaction effect , the initial photoabsorption mechanism is assumed to be dominated by one - body operators . even under quasi - elastic conditions , when this assumption is believed to have good chances to match reality , there are indications for many - body effects contributing to the ( e , e@xmath0p ) cross sections @xcite . already in the late fifties it was suggested that two - nucleon knockout reactions might shed some light on short - range correlations in nuclei .",
    "the underlying idea is that a photon hitting a strongly correlated nucleon pair will induce two nucleons to escape from the target @xcite .",
    "two - nucleon knockout reactions have been extensively studied using real photons . in these investigations",
    ", data have been taken in a wide photon energy range ( e@xmath11 1 gev ) , covering both the proton - proton and proton - neutron knockout channel .",
    "rather than revealing information about ground - state correlations , the gross features of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 data could be interpreted in terms of meson - exchange and pion degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "data for electroinduced two - nucleon knockout reactions are rather scarce .",
    "pioneering experiments have been performed at nikhef - k @xcite .",
    "more data will be collected at mami and tjnaf in the near future .",
    "it is hoped that the additional longitudinal degree of freedom will create optimum circumstances to reveal signatures of ground - state correlations .",
    "one of the principal aims of this paper is to provide a framework in which models for ground - state correlations can be confronted with cross sections for electroinduced two - nucleon knockout reactions . in our developments",
    "we leave room for reaction mechanisms that can feed the two - nucleon knockout channel and can not be directly associated with ground - state correlations .",
    "the major competing reaction mechanism consists of processes in which the photon is absorbed on two- , three- , ... nucleon currents .",
    "just as the ground - state correlation effects these multi - body currents are a natural manifestation of the many - body dynamics of the nuclear system .",
    "for the present purposes we will restrict ourselves to two - body currents related to one - pion exchange .",
    "the framework in which those currents are treated , however , is rather general and can be extended to include the effects of heavier meson exchange .",
    "apart from the exclusive two - nucleon knockout channel , we address also the ( e , e@xmath0p ) reaction .",
    "we concentrate on the high missing - energy region where the effects of ground - state correlations are predicted to manifest themselves .",
    "the exclusive nature of the electroproton reaction at high missing energies can not be guaranteed . in our theoretical considerations",
    ", the starting point will be that the single - particle spectral function is not a directly measurable quantity .",
    "it will be argued that two - nucleon knockout represents an important fraction of the continuum ( e , e@xmath0p ) strength and that the ( e , e@xmath0p ) can be considered as a possible source of information about many - body dynamics in the nuclear system .",

    "this is of particular importance in view of the fact that on several occasions we will make integrations over relatively large parts of the available phase space for the final products . in two - nucleon knockout from finite nuclei",
    "the final - state interaction involves apart from mutual interactions between the escaping nucleons also distorting effects from the residual @xmath19 system .",
    "another aspect of the fsi that deserves further attention is the role of multi - step processes .",
    "an obvious way to take these into account is a coupled - channel calculation . in the two - nucleon emission case , however , lots of channels are expected to contribute which makes a coupled - channel calculation very challenging . in the absence of a consistent and handleable theory to describe the full complexity of the fsi",
    ", we adopt the view that rather than accounting for only part of the fsi it is maybe better to work in a direct knockout model . or put in other words , we assume that the two nucleons involved in the photoabsorption mechanism will escape from the target nucleus without being subject to inelastic collisions with the core . this is the basic assumption of the so - called `` spectator approximation '' . in the shell - model picture , direct emission of two nucleons will leave the residual nucleus in a two - hole ( 2h ) state relative to the ground state of the target nucleus . even in a direct reaction model",

    "it is shown that a proper a - body wave function with two asymptotically free nucleons and a residual nucleus generated in a 2h state can be reached by performing a partial wave expansion in terms of the two - hole - two - particle eigenstates of a mean - field one - body hamiltonian . for the sake of completeness we mention the obtained expression for the required type of final wave function : @xmath37 the model that we adopt to account for the fsi is thus based on a partial wave expansion in terms of two - hole - two - particle ( 2h2p ) eigenstates of a mean - field potential .",

    "[ sec : mec ] and [ sec : src ] .      in comparison with exclusive ( e , e@xmath0nn ) reactions",
    "the semi - exclusive ( e , e@xmath0p ) channel is more attractive from the experimental point of view . for model calculations , however , the semi - exclusive channel can be more challenging than exclusive 2n knockout calculations .",
    "indeed two - nucleon knockout is expected to feed the semi - exclusive ( e , e@xmath0p ) channel as soon as the thresholds are crossed .",
    "the calculation of the two - nucleon knockout contribution to the semi - exclusive channel involves integration over the phase space of the undetected escaping nucleon ( either a proton or a neutron ) . in what follows",
    "we will exploit the fact that most of the derivations for the two - nucleon knockout cross sections in previous sections are done in coordinate space to perform some of these integrations analytically . in this way we facilitate the calculation of semi - exclusive cross sections enormously and develop a framework that can be further exploited to investigate the role of the dynamical nucleon - nucleon correlations in the semi - exclusive channel .",
    "as most of the dynamical correlations are believed to be of two - body nature , one could expect that they manifest themselves most clearly in the two - nucleon emission channel .",
    "it is a major challenge to trace those kinematical regions where the semi - exclusive channel is predominantly fed by emission of two nucleons .",
    "such investigations start from considering the contribution from ( e , e@xmath0pp ) and ( e , e@xmath0pn ) to the semi - exclusive channel  : @xmath55    an obvious way of determining the right - hand side of the above expression is calculating the 2n knockout cross sections for a grid of kinematical conditions that covers the full phase spaces @xmath56 ( ( e , e@xmath0pp ) contribution ) and @xmath57 ( ( e , e@xmath0pn ) contribution ) . those cross sections can then be integrated to obtain the semi - exclusive strength that is attributed to 2n knockout",
    ". such a procedure would be cumbersome and would consume a lot a computing time .",
    "we present an alternative method that avoids those numerical integrations at a very small cost for the accuracy of the calculated cross sections .",
    "we start with remarking that most of the two - nucleon emission strength @xmath58 ( a = p@xmath0,n ) is confined to a relatively small fraction of the complete @xmath59 phase space  : ever since the original work by k.  gottfried @xcite it has been clear that 2n knockout reactions predominantly occur in back - to - back situations ( quasi - deuteron kinematics ) .",
    "consequently , for a particular @xmath60 ( semi - exclusive situation ) most of the ( e , e@xmath0 n@xmath14 p ) strength will reside in a restricted angular range for the second nucleon n@xmath14 that remains undetected . in this restricted @xmath61 area",
    "the value of the undetected nucleon momentum , which is determined from energy - momentum conservation , will vary very slowly so that to a good approximation it can be replaced by an `` average '' value @xmath62 .",
    "this average momentum can be determined by imposing quasi - deuteron kinematics ( which is equivalent with considering the situation with zero recoil momentum ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the momentum of the detected proton . after introducing this `` average momentum '' , the integration over @xmath65 and @xmath66 in eq .",

    "the number of situations which have to be considered depends on the quantum numbers ( @xmath195 ) of the orbits from which the nucleons are escaping .",

    "[ fig : cross ] .",
    "another observation is that with the central correlation function of ref .",

    "this is a rather surprising result as their functional dependence on the relative coordinate of the two interacting particles is rather similar .",

    "these calculations have been performed according to the formalism outlined in sect.[sec : semi ] and include the meson - exchange and isobaric currents in addition to the strength generated by the jastrow correlations .",
    "the latter are accounted for in the fhnc parametrization .",
    "apart from the highest momentum transfer considered here , the calculations give a reasonable account of the measured strength . the major contribution to the semi - exclusive spectrum",
