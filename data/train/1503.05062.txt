    "in this paper we study what we call the _ modem illumination problem_. this problem stems from our daily use of laptop computers and wireless modems .",
    "experience shows that when trying to connect a laptop to a wireless modem , there are two factors that have to be considered : the _ distance _ to the wireless modem and , perhaps most important in many buildings , the _ number of walls _ separating our laptop from the wireless modem . from now on ,",
    "the term _ modem _ will be used to refer to a wireless modem .",
    "we call a modem _ a @xmath0-modem _ if it is strong enough to transmit a stable signal through  @xmath0 walls along a straight line .",
    "thus , we say that a point  @xmath10 in a polygon  @xmath11 is illuminated by a  @xmath12 in  @xmath11 if the line segment joining  @xmath10 to  @xmath12 _ crosses _ at most  @xmath0 walls ( edges ) of  @xmath11 . + _ * the modem illumination problem : * _ let  @xmath11 be a student center ( f.k.a .",

    "+ we point out that we allow a modem to be located at a point  @xmath13 on an edge  @xmath14 ( or even on a vertex  @xmath9 ) of  @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", we do not consider  @xmath14 ( or the two edges incident to  @xmath9 ) as a barrier for the modem .",
    "that is , the line segments connecting  @xmath13 and any point of @xmath11 do not cross  @xmath14 ( or the two edges incident to  @xmath9 ) . thus",

    "our problem corresponds to chvtal s art gallery theorem  @xcite which states that @xmath16 watchmen are always sufficient and sometimes necessary to guard an art gallery with @xmath1 walls .",
    "many generalizations of the original art gallery problem have been studied , see  @xcite for comprehensive surveys .",
    "the modem illumination problem was introduced in  @xcite .    a similar problem , posed by urrutia and solved by fulek et al .",
    "@xcite , is the following : what is the smallest number @xmath17 such that in any collection of @xmath1 pairwise disjoint convex sets in the @xmath18-dimensional euclidean space , there is a point such that any ray emanating from it meets at most @xmath19 sets of the collection ? in our language , they proved that one is always sufficient to illuminate the @xmath18-dimensional euclidean space in presence of  @xmath1 convex obstacles .    in  @xcite ,",
    "several variations of the modem illumination problem are studied .",
    "for example they present upper and lower bounds on the number of needed to illuminate the plane in the presence of obstacles modeled by line segments ( with fixed slopes ) , or nested polygons .",
    "they also present some bounds on illuminating special classes of simple polygons with in the interior of the polygon .",
    "polygon illumination with wireless devices has also been studied in a slightly different context , the so - called sculpture garden problem  @xcite . there",
    ", each device only broadcasts a signal within a given angle of the polygon and has unbounded range .",
    "the task is to describe the polygon ( that is , distinguish it from the exterior ) by a combination of the devices , meaning that for each point  @xmath10 in the interior of the polygon no point outside the polygon receives signals from the same devices as  @xmath10 .",
    "we remark that the general case of the modem illumination problem for is widely open .",
    "almost no tight bounds are known so far for any class of polygons for any @xmath20 ; see for example the recent column of orourke  @xcite .",
    "very recently , there has been some development on these problems in several directions .",
    "duque and hidalgo  @xcite have announced an upper bound of @xmath21 on the number of needed to illuminate the interior of a simple polygon of @xmath1 sides . in the case of orthogonal polygons",
    "they give a tighter bound of @xmath22 .",
    "for the related question on `` edge - transmitters '' ( modems where the signal is emanated from a whole edge instead of only a point ; see also  @xcite ) , cannon et al .",
    "@xcite consider several classes of polygons .",
    "they show lower ( i.e. , sometimes necessary ) and upper ( i.e. , always sufficient ) bounds on the number of needed transmitters for simple ( orthogonal ) ( monotone ) polygons .",
    "for example , for monotone polygons they prove @xmath23 and @xmath24 as lower and upper bounds , and they give a tight bound of @xmath25 for monotone orthogonal polygons .",
    "finally , in  @xcite , the same authors study the corresponding algorithmic optimization problems for both , point and edge transmitters .",
    "in particular , they show that it is np - hard to compute the minimum number of needed to illuminate a given simple polygon .",
    "in this paper we provide lower and upper bounds for the modem illumination problem for monotone polygons and monotone orthogonal polygons , which are a reasonable model of most real life buildings .",
    "these bounds are asymptotically tight ( i.e. , the lower and upper bounds match ) : @xmath2 for monotone polygons ; @xmath5 for monotone orthogonal polygons for  @xmath4 and even  @xmath0 ; and @xmath7 for monotone orthogonal polygons for  odd  @xmath6 .",
    "( note that these bounds improve the bounds from the preliminary version  @xcite . )",
    "to keep things as simple as possible we introduce several conventions on monotone polygons .",
    "when we speak of a polygon , we refer to both the boundary and the interior of the polygon . for technical reasons and without loss of generality",
    ", we make the following assumption : for a non - orthogonal monotone polygon , we assume that no two of its edges ( on different chains ) are parallel .    for any monotone polygon , we assume that the direction of monotonicity is the , and that no two vertices have the same @xmath26-coordinate .",
    "we denote a ( monotone ) polygon  @xmath11 with  @xmath1 vertices as ( monotone ) .",
    "further , we denote the vertices of  @xmath11 by @xmath27 , where the labels are given to the vertices with respect to their @xmath26-sorted order , such that @xmath28 is the leftmost and @xmath29 is the rightmost vertex of  @xmath11 .",
    "note that this implies that , in general , the vertices are not labeled with respect to their order along the boundary of  @xmath11 .    to validate possible positions we will consider rays from these positions . for a point @xmath13 of @xmath11",
