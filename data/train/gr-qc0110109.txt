    "the special theory of relativity is based on two basic postulates : lorentz invariance and the hypothesis of locality .",
    "lorentz invariance refers to a fundamental symmetry principle , namely , the invariance of basic physical laws under inhomogeneous lorentz transformations . in practice",
    "these laws of nature involve physical quantities measured by inertial observers in minkowski spacetime .",
    "an inertial observer always moves uniformly and refers its observations to the fixed spatial axes of an inertial frame ; it can be depicted by a straight line in the minkowski diagram and represents an ideal ; in fact , physical observers are all effectively accelerated .",
    "for instance , one can imagine the influence of radiation pressure on the path of a cosmic particle .",
    "in general , the acceleration of an observer consists of the translational acceleration of its path as well as the rotation of its spatial frame .",
    "observers with translational acceleration are therefore represented by curved lines in the minkowski diagram . as an example of a rotating observer ,",
    "consider a uniformly moving observer that refers its observations to spatial axes that rotate with respect to the spatial frame of the underlying inertial coordinate system .",
    "the hypothesis of locality refers to the measurements of realistic ( i.e. accelerated ) observers : such an observer is postulated to be equivalent , at each event along its worldline , to a momentarily comoving inertial observer .",
    "the origin of this assumption can be traced back to the work of lorentz in the context of his classical electron theory  @xcite ; later , it was simply adopted as a general rule in relativity theory  @xcite .    along its worldline , the accelerated observer passes through a continuous infinity of hypothetical momentarily comoving inertial observers",
    ". stated mathematically , the translationally accelerated observer s curved worldline is the _ envelope _ of the straight worldlines of this class of hypothetical inertial observers .",
    "therefore , the hypothesis of locality has two components : ( i ) the assumption that the measurements of the accelerated observer must be somehow connected to the measurements of the hypothetical class of momentarily comoving inertial observers along its worldline and ( ii ) that this connection is postulated to be the pointwise equivalence of the accelerated observer and the momentarily comoving inertial observer .",
    "the latter means that the acceleration of the observer does not _",
    "directly _ affect the result of its measurement ; devices that obey this rule are called  standard \" .",
    "thus the hypothesis of locality is a simple generalization of the assumption that the rods and clocks of special relativity theory are not directly affected by acceleration @xcite .    what is the physical basis for the hypothesis of locality ?",
    "it is difficult to argue with part ( i ) of this hypothesis , since the fundamental laws of ( nongravitational ) physics have been formulated with respect to inertial observers and hence the measurements of accelerated observers should be in some way related to those of inertial observers . on the other hand , part ( ii ) can only be valid if the measurement process occurs instantaneously and in a pointwise manner .",
    "that is , ( ii ) is appropriate for phenomena involving coincidences of classical point particles and null rays .",
    "classical waves , on the other hand , are extended in time and space with a characteristic wave period @xmath0 and a corresponding wavelength @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "imagine , for example , the measurement of the frequency of an incident electromagnetic wave by an accelerated observer ; at least a few periods of the wave must be received by the observer before an adequate determination of the frequency would become possible .",
    "thus this measurement process is nonlocal and extends over the worldline of the observer .",
    "the observer s acceleration can be characterized by certain _ acceleration lengths _ @xmath2 given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 for translational acceleration @xmath5 and rotational frequency @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the nonlocality of the external radiation is thus expected to couple with the intrinsic scales associated with the acceleration of the observer .",
    "classical wave phenomena are expected to violate the hypothesis of locality .",
    "the scale of such violation would be given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the _ acceleration time_. the hypothesis of locality will hold if @xmath1 is so small that the incident radiation behaves like a ray , i.e. in the eikonal ( or jwkb ) limit such that @xmath9 ; alternatively , @xmath2 can be so large that deviations of the form @xmath10 would be below the sensitivity threshold of the detectors available at present .",
    "consider , e.g. , laboratory experiments on the earth ; typical acceleration lengths would be @xmath11 and @xmath12 , so that for essentially all practical purposes one can ignore any possible deviations from locality at the present time . in this way",
    ", we can account for the fact that the standard theory of relativity is in agreement with all observational data available at present . as a matter of principle , however , it is necessary to contemplate generalizations of the hypothesis of locality in order to take due account of intrinsic wave phenomena for realistic ( accelerated ) observers .",
    "all of our considerations in this paper are within the framework of classical field theory ; nevertheless , it is necessary to remark that quantum theory is based on the notion of wave - particle duality , and so an adequate treatment of classical wave phenomena is a necessary prelude to a satisfactory quantum theory .    to proceed , we consider the most general extension of the hypothesis of locality that is consistent with causality and the superposition principle .",
    "a nonlocal lorentz - invariant theory of accelerated observers has been developed along these lines  @xcite and is presented in section  2 .",
    "the theory involves a kernel that depends primarily on the acceleration of the observer ; that is , the measurements of the observer depend on its past history of acceleration .",
    "the main physical principle that is employed in the nonlocal theory for the determination of the kernel is the assumption that an intrinsic radiation field can never stand completely still with respect to an accelerated observer ; this statement involves a simple generalization of a property of inertial observers to all observers .",
    "thus the accelerated observer is endowed with _ memory _ , and the past affects the present through an averaging process , where the weight function is proportional to the kernel @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out that the kernel @xmath14 can not be completely determined by the theory presented in section  2 .",
    "an additional simplifying assumption is therefore introduced in section  3 : @xmath15 must be a function of a single variable .",
    "two cases are then considered : ( 1 ) @xmath16 and ( 2 ) @xmath17 we show that case  ( 1)i.e .",
    "the _ kinetic _ memory case  has acceptable properties that are described in section 3 .",
    "case  ( 2 ) , i.e. the _ dynamic _ memory case , is treated in detail in sections 3 and 4 , where it is shown that the kernel function @xmath18 can be unbounded even if the observer s past history has constant velocity except for one episode of smooth translational acceleration with finite duration .",
    "specifically , we study the measurement of electromagnetic radiation fields by an observer that undergoes translational or rotational acceleration that lasts for only a finite interval of its proper time . after the acceleration is turned off , the observer measures in addition to the regular field a residual field that contains the memory of its past acceleration .",
    "this leftover piece is a finite _ constant _ field ( _ kinetic _ memory ) in case ( 1 ) ; however , it is time dependent ( _ dynamic _ memory ) in case ( 2 ) .",
    "we rule out the latter case , since we prove that the measured field could diverge under certain reasonable circumstances .",
    "we are thus left with a unique theory that involves kinetic memory .",
    "an important aspect of our nonlocal ansatz is that the kernel induced by the acceleration of the observer depends on the spin of the radiation field under consideration . in particular",
    ", the kernel vanishes for an intrinsic scalar field , i.e. such a field is always _",
    "local_. as discussed in section  5 , our theory therefore rules out the possibility that a pure scalar ( or pseudoscalar ) field exists in nature .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with available experimental data .",
    "the nonlocal theory therefore predicts that any scalar particle would have to be a composite .",
    "section 5 contains a brief discussion and our conclusions .",
    "a detailed discussion of the observational consequences of the nonlocal theory is beyond the scope of this work . in the following , we use units such that @xmath19 , i.e. the speed of light in vacuum is unity .",
    "the measurement of length by accelerated observers involves subtle issues in relativity theory that have been investigated in detail @xcite ; for our present purpose , the main result of such studies is that an accelerated frame of reference , i.e. an extended coordinate system set up in the neighborhood of an accelerated observer , is of rather limited theoretical significance .",
    "we shall therefore refer all measurements to an inertial reference frame in minkowski spacetime .",
    "imagine a global inertial frame with coordinates @xmath20 and the standard class of static inertial observers with their orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the temporal direction at each event and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , are the spatial directions .",
    "the hypothesis of locality implies that an accelerated observer is also endowed with a tetrad frame @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the proper time along its worldline . for each @xmath27 , @xmath28 coincides with the constant tetrad frame ( related to @xmath29 by a lorentz transformation ) of the momentarily comoving inertial observer .",
    "we note that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a tensor such that @xmath32 and @xmath33@xmath6@xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the translational acceleration of the observer and @xmath6@xmath36 is the rotational frequency of its spatial frame .",
    "each element of the acceleration tensor @xmath37 is a scalar under the inhomogeneous lorentz transformations of the background spacetime .",
    "we assume throughout that the acceleration is turned on at @xmath38 and will in general be turned off at @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 represent an electromagnetic radiation field as measured by the standard set of static inertial observers .",
    "according to the hypothesis of locality @xmath41 , i.e. the projection of the field on the instantaneous tetrad frame , would be the field measured by the accelerated observer .",
    "on the other hand , let @xmath42 be the true result of such a measurement .",
    "taking causality into account , the most general linear relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is @xmath45 this relation refers to quantities that are all scalars under the poincar group of spacetime transformations of the underlying inertial coordinate system .",
    "we note that the magnitude of the nonlocal part of equation is of the form @xmath10 if the kernel is proportional to the acceleration of the observer .",
    "it follows from volterra s theorem that in the space of continuous functions the relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath47 is unique  @xcite ; this theorem has been extended to the hilbert space of square - integrable functions by tricomi  @xcite .    the basic ansatz   is consistent with an observation originally put forward by bohr and rosenfeld that the electromagnetic field can not be measured at a spacetime _",
    "point _ ; in fact , an averaging process is necessary over a spacetime neighborhood  @xcite . in the case of measurements by",
    "_ inertial _ observers envisaged by bohr and rosenfeld  @xcite , there is no intrinsic temporal or spatial scale associated with the inertial observers ; therefore , one can effectively pass to the limiting case of a point with no difficulty as the dimensions of the spacetime neighborhood can be shrunk to zero without any obstruction . for an accelerated observer ,",
    "however , the intrinsic acceleration time and length need to be properly taken into account . hence the nonlocal ansatz   may be interpreted in terms of a certain averaging process over the past worldline of the accelerated observer .    to determine the kernel @xmath14 ,",
    "let us first mention a basic consequence of the hypothesis of locality for a radiation field .",
    "imagine plane monochromatic electromagnetic waves of frequency @xmath48 propagating along the @xmath49-axis and an observer rotating uniformly about this axis with frequency @xmath50 in the @xmath51-plane on a circle of radius @xmath52 in the underlying inertial reference frame .",
    "we find from @xmath53 that according to the rotating observer the frequency of the wave is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the lorentz factor corresponding to the speed @xmath56 of the observer and the upper ( lower ) sign refers to incident positive ( negative ) helicity radiation .",
    "this result has a simple intuitive interpretation : in an incident positive ( negative ) helicity wave the electric and magnetic field vectors rotate with frequency @xmath57 about the direction of propagation of the wave .",
    "as seen by the rotating observer , the field vectors rotate with frequency @xmath58 with respect to the inertial temporal coordinate @xmath59 ; moreover , the lorentz factor simply accounts for time dilation @xmath60 .",
    "it follows that a positive helicity incident wave can stand completely still with respect to all observers rotating uniformly with frequency @xmath61 . in terms of energy",
    ", we have @xmath62@xmath63@xmath64 @xmath6@xmath65 , where @xmath63 is the spin of the incident photon . more generally , for oblique incidence @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the multipole parameter such that @xmath68 is the component of the total ( orbital plus spin ) angular momentum along the @xmath49-axis .",
    "this is an example of the general phenomenon of spin - rotation coupling ; various aspects of this effect and the available observational evidence are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "again , the incident wave can theoretically stand completely still for all observers rotating with frequency @xmath50 such that @xmath69 .",
    "let us recall here a fundamental consequence of lorentz invariance , namely that a radiation field can never stand completely still with respect to an inertial observer .",
    "that is , an inertial observer can move along the direction of propagation of a wave so fast that the frequency @xmath70 can approach zero but the mathematical limit of @xmath71 is never physically achieved , since the observer s speed can not reach the speed of light in vacuum @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , for an inertial observer @xmath71 implies that @xmath73 . on the other hand , while we find that the hypothesis of locality predicts that a circularly polarized wave can stand completely still with respect to a uniformly rotating observer , this possibility can be avoided in the nonlocal theory by an appropriate choice of the kernel .    to implement the requirement that a radiation field can never stand completely still with respect to any observer",
    ", we assume that if @xmath43 turns out to be constant in equation  , then @xmath40 must have been originally constant just as in the case of inertial observers in the standard theory of relativity .",
    "it is convenient to replace the tensor @xmath40 by a six - vector @xmath47 , with electric and magnetic fields as components , and introduce the `` lorentz '' matrix @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "then for constant fields @xmath47 and @xmath46 , equation   takes the form @xmath76 where for @xmath77 , the matrix @xmath78 is constant and @xmath79 .",
    "thus in the nonlocal theory the kernel @xmath14 should be determined from the volterra integral equation @xmath80 it follows from volterra s theory ( see appendix a ) that to every kernel @xmath14 corresponds a unique _ resolvent _ kernel @xmath81 such that @xmath82 therefore , only the integral of the resolvent kernel is completely determined by our physical requirement @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the unit matrix .",
    "it is clear at this point that given @xmath85 , relations  are not sufficient to determine the kernel @xmath14 uniquely . to proceed further , other simplifying restrictions are necessary on @xmath14 or @xmath86 , @xmath87 this must be done in such a way as to preserve time translation invariance in the underlying inertial coordinate system .",
    "let us finally remark that for a scalar field , @xmath88 and equations  simply reduce to the requirement that @xmath13 must have a vanishing integral over @xmath89 .",
    "that is , the connection between the kernel and the acceleration of the observer disappears .",
    "this circumstance is further discussed in section 5 .",
    "it is necessary to introduce simplifying assumptions in order to find a unique kernel @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore tentatively postulate that @xmath14 is a function of a single variable .",
    "there are two reasonable possibilities : @xmath90 in either case , the basic requirement of time translation invariance in the background global inertial frame is satisfied .      in case",
    "( 1 ) , the kernel @xmath91 corresponds to a simple weight function that can be determined by differentiating equation  , @xmath92 the kernel @xmath91 is thus directly proportional to the acceleration of the observer .",
    "a significant feature of this kernel is that once the acceleration is turned off at @xmath93 , then for @xmath94 , @xmath95 there is therefore a _ constant _ memory of past acceleration and the field @xmath46 satisfies the standard field equations in the inertial frame .",
    "that is , the field equations are linear differential equations and the addition of a constant solution is always permissible but subject to boundary conditions . in terms of actual laboratory devices that have experienced accelerations in the past , such constant fields as in equation   would be canceled once the devices are reset .",
    "thus case  ( 1 ) involves simple `` nonpersistent '' memory of past acceleration ; therefore , we call @xmath91 the _ kinetic memory _ kernel .",
    "it is interesting to note that our basic integral equation   together with the kinetic memory kernel   and an integration by parts takes the form @xmath96 } \\lambda df,\\ ] ] so that @xmath97 along the worldline of the accelerated observer .",
    "the second case involves a convolution type kernel @xmath98 .",
    "it follows ( see appendix a ) that in this case the resolvent kernel is of convolution type as well , @xmath99 .",
    "thus equation   can be written , after expressing the left side as the area under the graph of the function @xmath100 from the origin to @xmath101 , as @xmath102 the kernel @xmath18 is then given by ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) @xmath103 where a star denotes the convolution operation .",
    "we note that in this case the _ resolvent _ kernel is directly proportional to acceleration , so that @xmath104 and , by equation  , @xmath105 for @xmath106 or @xmath107 , i.e. before the acceleration is turned on .",
    "however , the character of memory that is indicated by @xmath18 , @xmath108 is more complicated than in case  ( 1 ) due to the intricate relationship between @xmath109 and @xmath110 in equation  . even if the acceleration is turned off at @xmath93 , it turns out that @xmath18 does not vanish in general for @xmath111 and could even be divergent ; in fact , proving the latter point is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "imagine , for instance , that @xmath110 is finite everywhere and decays exponentially to zero for @xmath112 .",
    "then in equation  , as @xmath113 long after the acceleration has been turned off at @xmath93 , the contribution of the nonlocal term in rapidly approaches a constant and we essentially recover the `` nonpersistent '' kinetic memory familiar from case  ( 1 ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that in general case  ( 2 ) involves situations with persistent or _ dynamic _",
    "memory such that under certain conditions @xmath110 could diverge resulting in an asymptotically divergent @xmath114 .",
    "the convolution ( faltung ) type kernel is generally employed in many branches of physics and mathematics . as in equation  , to produce the nonlocal part of the output @xmath114 , an input signal @xmath115 is linearly folded , starting from @xmath27 and going backwards in proper time until @xmath116 , with a weight function @xmath110 that is the impulse response of the system .",
    "the use of convolution type kernels is standard practice in phenomenological treatments of the electrodynamics of media  @xcite , feedback control systems  @xcite , etc .",
    "we find , however , that for the pure vacuum case the convolution kernel due to _ nonuniform acceleration _ in general leads to instability and is therefore unacceptable .",
    "this proposition is proved in the following section for the translational and rotational accelerations of the observer .",
    "the simplicity of the kinetic memory versus dynamic memory has been particularly stressed by hehl and obukhov in their investigations of nonlocal electrodynamics  @xcite ; moreover , their work has led to the question of the ultimate physical significance of the convolution type kernel in the nonlocal theory of accelerated systems  @xcite .",
    "this question is settled in the present paper in favor of the kinetic memory kernel .",
    "imagine an observer at rest on the @xmath49-axis for @xmath117 . at @xmath118 ,",
    "the observer accelerates along the positive @xmath49-direction with acceleration @xmath119 . for @xmath120",
    ", we set @xmath121 @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the natural nonrotating orthonormal tetrad frame of the observer along its worldline is given by @xmath124 in this case @xmath85 is given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , is a @xmath128 matrix proportional to the operator of infinitesimal rotations about the @xmath129-axis .",
    "let us first consider case  ( 1 ) , for which the kernel can be easily computed using equation  , @xmath130 so that when the acceleration is turned off at @xmath93 the kernel @xmath91 vanishes with the acceleration for @xmath131 . on the other hand , @xmath91 is simply constant for uniform acceleration ( i.e. hyperbolic motion ) with @xmath132 for @xmath133 . in the rest of this section , we focus attention on case  ( 2 ) involving the convolution kernel .    for the convolution kernel ,",
    "the resolvent kernel is given , via equation  , by @xmath134 where @xmath135 . in principle , the convolution kernel can be computed via the substitution of equation   in equation  ; however , this turns out to be a daunting task in practice .",
    "imagine , for instance , that the acceleration is turned off at @xmath136 , so that the resolvent kernel has compact support over a time interval of length @xmath137 and vanishes otherwise .",
    "it then follows that the @xmath138 term in the expansion has compact support over a time interval of length @xmath139 .",
    "the summation of series turns out to be rather complicated , except for the case of _ uniform _ acceleration , i.e. @xmath132 for @xmath133 , and the result is @xmath140 it is interesting to note that equation is the _ same _ as the result of case  ( 1 ) , equation  , for _ uniform _ acceleration .    in view of the difficulty of summing the series directly ,",
    "we find it advantageous to use laplace transforms , which we denote by an overbar , i.e. @xmath141 , where @xmath142 then , taking the laplace transform of equation   and using the convolution ( faltung ) theorem repeatedly , we arrive at @xmath143^{-1}-i,\\ ] ] which is consistent with the reciprocity between @xmath18 and @xmath100 .",

    "it is possible to obtain series representations for @xmath175 and @xmath176 ( see appendix c ) ; however , to gain insight into the asymptotic behavior of @xmath175 and @xmath176 it proves more fruitful to proceed with an investigation of the singularities of @xmath177 and @xmath178 in the complex @xmath179-plane .",
    "this is due to a simple property of the laplace transformation in equation   extended to the complex @xmath179-plane : let us suppose that the convolution kernel @xmath110 is a bounded function for all @xmath180 as one naturally expects of a function that represents memory ; then , for any @xmath179 in the complex plane with positive real part , i.e. @xmath181 , equation   implies that the absolute magnitude of @xmath182 should be finite , i.e. @xmath182 can not be singular .",
    "therefore , if we could show that @xmath182 has in fact pole singularities at complex values of @xmath179 with @xmath181 , then it would simply follow that @xmath110 can not be bounded for all @xmath183 and would thus be unsuitable to represent the memory of finite accelerated motion .",

    "thus the rest of this subsection is devoted to the determination of the poles of @xmath182 in the right half - plane .",

    "let us consider the complex roots in the right half - plane of the equation @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is one of the real numbers @xmath200 .",

    "the use of convolution kernels is standard practice in the nonlocal electrodynamics of continuous media , where it is assumed phenomenologically that memory always fades . in our treatment of acceleration - induced nonlocality in vacuum , however , the behavior of memory must be determined from first principles . in this connection ,",

    "the theory developed here is applicable to any basic field ; however , for the sake of concreteness and in view of possible observational consequences , we employ electromagnetic radiation fields throughout .",
    "a basic consequence of the nonlocal theory of accelerated systems is that it is incompatible with the existence of a basic scalar field ; that is , in this case @xmath88 , @xmath432 and the nonlocality disappears so that a basic scalar radiation field can stay completely at rest with respect to a rotating observer in contradiction with our fundamental physical assumption .",
    "this prediction of the nonlocal theory is in agreement with present experimental data .",
    "further confrontation of the nonlocal theory with observation is urgently needed .",
    "consider an integral equation of the form @xmath433 where @xmath434 is a continuous function , the kernel @xmath14 is continuous and @xmath435 is a constant parameter .",

    "the proof of the existence and uniqueness of the resolvent kernel is by successive approximation .",
    "in fact , the solution @xmath437 can be obtained as the uniform limit of the sequence of continuous functions @xmath438 defined as follows : @xmath439 and @xmath440 thus @xmath441\\,dy\\\\ \\label{a5 } \\tag{a5 } = & \\;\\phi_1(x)+\\epsilon^2\\int^x_ak(x , y)\\int^y_a k(y , z)\\psi ( z)\\ , dz dy.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integration in is over a triangular domain in the @xmath442-plane defined by the vertices @xmath443 , @xmath444 and @xmath445 . changing the order of the integration in results in the equality @xmath446\\ , dy\\\\ & \\quad = \\int^x_a\\left [ \\int^x_z k ( x , y ) k(y , z)\\,dy\\right ] \\psi ( z)\\,dz.\\end{split}\\ ] ] let us define the successive iterated kernels of @xmath14 by @xmath447 and @xmath448 then we can write as @xmath449 and similarly @xmath450 etc . , such that in general @xmath451    iterating for @xmath452 and summing the equations results in @xmath453 \\psi ( z)\\,dz,\\ ] ] which can be rewritten as @xmath454 \\psi   ( y)\\,dy.\\ ] ] it can be shown that the uniform limit as @xmath455 exists ( see  @xcite ) .",
