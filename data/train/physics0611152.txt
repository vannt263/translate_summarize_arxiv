    "a basic aspect of plasma physics is the so - called debye shielding of the electrostatic potential .",
    "this consists in the property of plasmas ( or electrolytes @xcite ) , either quasi - neutral or non - neutral , to shield the electrostatic field produced by charged particles ( to be also denoted as test particles ) immersed in the same system .",
    "this result has fundamental consequences on plasma phenomenology , since it actually limits the range of static coulomb interactions inside the debye sphere , i.e. , at a distance @xmath0 from the test particle@xmath1 @xmath2 being the debye length . as usual here @xmath3 where the sum is carried out on all plasma species and @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 being respectively the @xmath7species temperature and number density ( the latter defined in the absence of test particles ) .",
    "in fact , when both the particles and the plasma are assumed non - relativistic , small - amplitude , stationary ( or slowly time- and space - varying ) , electrostatic perturbations generated by isolated test particles , result effectively shielded in the external domain , i.e. , at distances larger than the debye length @xmath2 .",
    "the renewed interest in this problem @xcite is particularly related to dusty plasmas or colloidal suspensions which are characterized by the presence of a large fraction of highly charged particles ( grains ) , i.e. , having an electric charge @xmath8 with @xmath9 .    in this work",
    "we intend to analyze the consistency of the traditional mathematical model for the so - called _ debye screening problem _ ( dsp ) originally formulated by debye and hckel ( _ dh model _",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", we intend to prove that the 3d poisson equation involved in the dh model does not admit physically acceptable solutions , i.e. , solutions which are provided by ordinary functions and are at least continuous in the domain of existence , i.e. , are so - called classical ( or strong ) solutions . for this purpose a modified model",
    "is proposed which takes into account the effect of local plasma sheath ( i.e. , the local domain near test particles where the plasma must be considered discrete ) .",
    "basic consequences of the model are discussed , which concern the asymptotic properties of the solutions determined both for weakly and strongly - coupled plasmas .    despite previous attempts to construct approximate or exact solutions to the dh model @xcite",
    ", the related mathematical model appears incomplete and can be shown to be physically unacceptable , due to the neglect of the local plasma sheath .",
    "in fact , it is obvious that sufficiently close to the point - particle the so - called weak - field approximation is violated making the dh model invalid tessarotto2006 . in the past",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that in such a case the test particle does not produce any electric field , but only complete charge neutralization by the plasma , thus producing a debye length which effectively vanishes .",
    "other objections concerned the asserted indeterminacy of the solution for @xmath10 due to its divergence in the same point @xcite .",
    "these issues were later addressed in a more general context @xcite , including the 2d case where complete neutralization can not be achieved . to recover the correct physical picture the effect of local plasma sheath must be included . nevertheless , for suitably dense plasmas or in the case of plasma species characterized by very high electric charges ( high - z ) , such as dusty plasmas , the weak - field approximation may be locally violated .",
    "this circumstance , when the effect of finite local plasma sheath is included , occurs if the normalized electrostatic potential @xmath11 results of order unit or larger on the boundary of the plasma sheath ( produced by at least one of the @xmath12 plasma species ) , namely for @xmath13    it is well - known that , in general , the debye effect occurs provided suitable physical assumptions are introduced .",
    "in particular , the plasma must be assumed appropriately close to kinetic maxwellian equilibrium , in which each particle species is described by a maxwellian kinetic distribution function carrying finite fluid fields [ defined respectively by the number density , temperature and flow velocity @xmath14 . in the absence of test particles these fluid fields",
    "must be assumed slowly varying in a suitable sense , or constant , both with respect to position ( @xmath15 ) and time ( @xmath16 ) .  in this regard",
    "it is important to remark that the appropriate treatment of the plasma sheath surrounding each test particle is essential also for the validity of the mathematical model for the debye screening problem , i.e. , for the existence of classical solutions of the debye screening problem , which do not exist when letting @xmath17 tessarotto2006 .",
    "another significant aspect concerns the issue of the absorption of plasma particles by the test particle , which effectively modifies the local charge density of the background plasma species bernstein1959,alpert1965,allen1992 .",
    "since the particle capture mechanism is a manifestly charge - dependent and velocity - dependent phenomenon ( in particular it depends on the angular momentum of the incoming particle ) , it is obvious that in principle it can produce deviations from local maxwellian equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , this phenomenon is expected to become relevant only if the radii of the test particle and of the surrounding plasma sheath ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are comparable , i.e. , @xmath20 . instead , is results negligible when @xmath21 .",
    "since dusty and colloidal plasmas are characterized by typical grain size @xmath18 smaller than @xmath22 @xmath23 and radius of plasma sheath @xmath19 of the order of @xmath24 @xmath23 , these effects will be considered negligible .",
    "goal of this work is the analysis of dsp and the definition of a suitably modified mathematical model to take into account the effect of local plasma sheaths in quasi - neutral plasmas .",
    "in particular , in sec .",
    "2 a modified debye screening problem ( modified dsp ) is presented . in sec .",
    "3 the basic mathematical result is presented which concerns the non - existence of classical solutions of dsp .",
    "the proof is reached by noting that dsp can be obtained as limit problem obtained from the modified dsp .",
    "basic feature of the approach is the representation of the poisson equation in integral form .",
    "this permits to analyze the asymptotic properties of the solutions of the modified problem in the limit @xmath25 it is found , that the limit solution of the modified dsp for @xmath26 is a distribution which vanishes identically for all @xmath27 and is discontinuous in @xmath28 hence , the limit function @xmath29 is not an strong solution of the dsp equation .",
    "this is therefore a characteristic property of the dh model . in particular , as a basic consequence , the effective charge of the dh asymptotic solution @xmath30 vanishes identically in such a limit and results independent of the charge of the test particle .",
    "the traditional formulation of the dsp , based on the debye - hckel model @xcite regards the test particles as point - like and having a spherically - symmetric charge distribution while ignoring the effect of local plasma sheath .",
    "this implies , from the physical standpoint , to neglect the discrete nature of the plasma .",
    "here we shall consider a modified modified debye - hckel model , based on the introduction of the notion of _ local plasma sheath _ @xcite . in the sequel we shall consider for simplicity of notation the case of a two species - plasma , formed by electrons and hydrogen ions , having an unique plasma sheath .",
    "thus , we shall assume that the test particle is represented by a spherically symmetric charge of radius @xmath31 for a particle in which @xmath32 the plasma sheath is represented by the spherical shell centered at the position ( center ) of the test particle for which @xmath33 , in which the plasma charge density ( except for the presence of the test particle ) results negligible .",
    "in the sequel we can also let in particular @xmath34 ( point - like test particle ) or @xmath35 ( finite - size test particle ) .",
    "the customary dh model is thus recovered letting @xmath36 and taking the limit @xmath37 ( or in dimensionless variables , requiring @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xmath40 ) .",
    "denoting @xmath41 the solution of the poisson equation , here we intend to determine its asymptotic properties in the limit @xmath42 while  also letting @xmath43 ( see lemma ) . as a consequence and in agreement with @xcite , in such a case it follows that the limit function @xmath44 vanishes identically for @xmath45 i.e. , @xmath46 in addition , in the same set we intend to prove the identity @xmath47where @xmath48 us the ( weak ) heaviside function . in detail the relevant equations valid in each subdomain for the normalized electrostatic potential @xmath49 are as follows . in the internal domain @xmath50 the electrostatic potential is assumed constant , namely @xmath51 . in the plasma sheath @xmath52 @xmath41 satisfies the customary poisson equation in the presence of the charge density produced by a finite - size spherically - symmetric charge @xmath53finally , in the external domain @xmath54 there holds the poisson equation in the presence of the plasma charge density : @xmath55the boundary conditions , imposed respectively at infinity and at the boundary of the plasma sheath , are specified as follows @xmath56we notice that , if @xmath57 ( for example , @xmath43)@xmath1 @xmath58 results by assumption at least of class @xmath59 where @xmath60 x_{p},\\infty \\right [ $ ] . here @xmath61 are both assumed constant and strictly positive real numbers . the problem defined by ( [ dsp modified]),([dsp - modified -b ] ) , together with the boundary conditions ( [ bc-1 b]),([bc-2 b ] ) ,",

    "it is immediate to establish , the existence and uniqueness of @xmath41 in the functional  class @xmath70 together with its continuous dependence on initial data , in particular the continuity with respect to the parameter @xmath71 moreover , assuming that the weak - fields approximation applies ( this condition is manifestly fulfilled identically in the weak - coupling ordering,@xmath72 and is satisfied at least for @xmath73 suitably large@xmath1 it is immediate to prove that in this subset an asymptotic  solution of the modified dsp is provided by the _ external asymptotic solution _",
