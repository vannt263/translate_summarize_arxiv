    "ratchet systems , i.e. brownian particles moving in asymmetric periodic potentials , have been largely investigated in the last ten years , since their first version was introduced by ajdari and prost @xcite .",
    "these systems are maintained far from equilibrium by periodic or correlated stochastic forces which can be either multiplicative or additive , ( the corresponding models being called _ flushing - potential _ and _ fluctuating - force _ ratchets , respectively ) , so that the thermal bath energy can be converted into effective work without any conflict with the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the damping and the asymmetry of the potential are crucial ingredients for this conversion , both in the multiplicative @xcite and in the additive @xcite case .",
    "this phenomenon arises in a variety of different systems and has been used to design new experimental devices both for physical and biological applications @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ratchet effect is presently considered as a possible mechanisms by which molecular motors ( e.g. kinesins , myosins , dyneins ) take advantage of thermal fluctuations to perform their functions @xcite .    on the other hand , _ fluctuating - force _",
    "ratchet dynamics are possible also in absence of noise , both in overdamped systems @xcite and in underdamped chaotic ones @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite the ratchet motion of a particle subject to an additive periodic forcing ( _ fluctuating - force ratchet _ ) was ascribed to phase locking between the motion of the particle in the asymmetric potential and the frequency of the driver .",
    "the current steps arising from this phase locking dynamics were well preserved ( at least the relevant ones ) also in presence of noise , with a tendency of decreasing in width as the noise intensity was increased .",
    "thus , at least for these types of ratchets , phase locking emerges as the basic mechanism underlying ratchet dynamics , both in presence and in absence of noise .",
    "since phase locking is a very well known and largely investigated phenomenon in many areas of science , one can take advantage of its knowledge to infer results in the field of ratchets .",
    "thus , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the phase locking steps arising in the voltage - current characteristic of a long josephson junction can be stabilized by applying weak subharmonic signals which suppress the deterministic chaos @xcite .",
    "the above phase locking interpretation of the ratchet dynamics naturally suggests that similar stabilization phenomena could exists also in _ fluctuating - force _ ratchet models .",
    "the present paper is just devoted to this , i.e. we study the effects of weak subharmonic signals on the ratchet dynamics of an underdamped particle moving in an asymmetric potential both in absence and in presence of noise .",
    "the aim of the paper is twofold .",
    "from one side we are interested to enlarge the regions of the parameter space for which stable direct currents are observed .",
    "we find that this is indeed possible and better achieved when weak subharmonic signals , in - phase with the internal driver , are applied .",
    "the stabilization effect is observed both in presence and in absence of noise and is accompanied , in analogy with josephson junctions @xcite , by a suppression of the deterministic chaos , a property which can be useful in technical applications .",
    "on the other side , we are interested in an external control on the functioning of the ratchet mechanism .",
    "we find that , depending on the relative phase between external and internal drivers , one can stabilize different orbits of the system , as well as , destabilize the ratchet .",
    "thus , when the unidirectional motion of a physical or biological system is governed by an additive ratchet , it could be possible to control its dynamics by applying suitable `` out of phase '' subharmonic signals .",
    "in many practical situations , however , the relative phase between the internal and the external ( subharmonic ) driver could be difficult to control . in these cases the phase should be considered as a random variable and a final average on it should be performed in the calculation of the current .",
    "we find that also in this case , although reduced , the subharmonic signal induces a stabilization on the ratchet dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ first ] we introduce the model and discuss the stabilization induced by a weak subharmonic field , in - phase with the internal driver , both in absence and in presence of noise . in section [ second ]",
    "we investigate the effects of a relative phase between the two drivers on the stabilization phenomenon .",
    "finally , the main results of the paper will be resumed in the conclusions .",
    "to conform with previous studies we take the same model as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. we consider a particle that moves in the spatially periodic asymmetric potential @xmath0 @xmath1 , \\ ] ] subjected to time - periodic forcing , damping , and noise . in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 are introduced in order to have one potential minimum in @xmath4 with @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "since we are interested in stabilization effects , we introduce also a small subharmonic signal , so that the equation of motion , in dimensionless variables , is @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the friction coefficient , @xmath9 is a white noise fluctuation and @xmath10 its intensity , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are respectively the frequency and amplitude of the internal driver , @xmath13 is the amplitude of a small ( @xmath14 ) subharmonic field , and @xmath15 a relative phase .    in the deterministic case and in absence of the subharmonic signal ( @xmath16 ) , it is known that net average motion in one direction arises when the time required for the particle to move from one well of the potential to another is commensurable with the period of the internal driver , i.e. when the particle motion becomes locked to the driver @xcite .",
    "the mean velocity of the particle stays constant for all parameter values for which the locked solution is stable ( locking range ) , and is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spatial period of the potential ( in our case @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 and we call @xmath21 the fundamental locked mean velocity induced by the driver @xmath22 ( the current is calculated as the particle velocity averaged over time , or , briefly , _ mean velocity _ , @xmath23 ) .",
    "when the conditions of eq .",
    "( [ rule ] ) are achieved the particle follows regular orbits in the phase space , otherwise it displays a chaotic motion with zero mean velocity @xcite . to simplify our study we fix in all the following numerical simulations , @xmath24 and @xmath25 (",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for other parameter values ) and consider @xmath12 and @xmath13 to be free parameters .",
    "the solid curve reported in fig .",
    "1 represents the average velocity ( current ) of the particle vs the internal driver amplitude for @xmath26 and in absence of noise ( the average is taken over @xmath27 forcing periods , with a time step of @xmath28 ) .",
    "current steps with velocities @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , as well as chaotic regions without locking effects , are clearly recognized . to investigate stabilization phenomena induced by the subharmonic driver we consider @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ sub ] ) and focus , for simplicity , on the largest current step in fig .  1 ( solid curve ) corresponding approximately to the range @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "let us start first with the case of zero noise and zero relative phase between the two drivers .",
    "the stabilization effect in this case is seen from the enlargement of the steps computed for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 as reported by the broken curves of fig .  1 ( the curves with increasing values of @xmath13 were vertically shifted to avoid overlapping ) . in the inset of the figure the step width as a function of @xmath13",
    "is also reported , from which we see that the width increases roughly linearly with the subharmonic amplitude .",
    "as expected from ref.@xcite , the subharmonic signal tends to suppress the chaos present in the system , and at @xmath38 the chaotic region near @xmath39 , visible in the @xmath26 case , disappears completely . at higher values of @xmath13 ,",
    "the situation becomes more involved ( steps can `` break '' and instabilities arise ) due to the more complicated structure of the phase space of the two - drivers system ( in these cases the subharmonic is not anymore a small perturbation ) .",
    "let us now introduce noise in the system but still with the relative phase @xmath15 fixed to zero .",
    "we choose a noise intensity @xmath40 , corresponding , in the dimensional parameter space , to approximatively thermal noise at room temperature for a system with mass @xmath41 , spacing @xmath42 and a potential barrier of @xmath43 @xcite .    in figure  2 we present the results of the application of the same external driving forces considered in the deterministic case to a population of @xmath44 particles in presence of noise .",
    "we have introduced again a vertical shift for each curve for the aim of readability of the picture ( the mean velocity is now averaged also over all particles , @xmath45 ) . at @xmath40 and @xmath26 ( figure  2 , solid line ) , almost all the steps in the same range of figure  1 disappear ; nevertheless , the largest one is preserved and still corresponds to a constant velocity @xmath30 .",
    "note however how its width is reduced in presence of noise . even in this case , the stabilization effect of the subharmonic driving term results with evidence .",
    "the step in current is more and more enlarged by the application of the external forcing with increasing amplitudes ( the step width as a function of @xmath13 is displayed in the inset of fig .  2 ) .",
    "from these results we see that the region of the internal parameter space for which a stable direct current is observed can be significantly enlarged by the application of a weak subharmonic field , in - phase with the internal driver , either in absence or in presence of noise .",
    "moreover , we observe that the stabilization effect is always associated with a suppression of the deterministic chaos .",
    "in natural systems , such as biological motors , the phase of the internal driver is an unknown parameter so that @xmath15 becomes difficult ( if not impossible ) to control . furthermore , a population of many of such motors should correspond to a set of model particles with random phases , their internal drivers being , in principle , not synchronized .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the effect of the phase @xmath15 on the stabilization .",
    "since the noise leads to a smoothing of the current steps with a reduction of their widths , we shall concentrate only on the deterministic @xmath46 case .    to this end",
    "we have studied the effect of the phase @xmath15 for some fixed values of the internal and external driver amplitude .",
    "the external driver was fixed to @xmath38 in all cases . letting evolve the system according to eq .",
    "( [ sub ] ) for each different value of @xmath15 in @xmath47 , we obtained for different values of @xmath12 the mean velocity as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "results for some interesting values of @xmath12 are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the first three value of the internal driver of figure  3 , i.e. @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , all correspond to points on the current step ( see figure  1 , dotted line ) .",
    "the effect of the subharmonic driver results to be indeed phase dependent .",
    "while the mean velocity at @xmath51 is @xmath30 in all three cases , the stabilization of the corresponding orbit arises only in some ranges of the parameter @xmath15",
    ". when the internal and external drivers are approximatively around phase @xmath52 or @xmath53 , it can happens that the subharmonic tends to destabilize the system to a chaotic orbit , as for @xmath48 ; in other cases , it tends instead to stabilize a symmetrical orbit with opposite velocity @xmath32 , as for @xmath39 .",
    "the stabilization regions , however , are dominant with respect to the chaotic ones .",
    "this is a consequence of the coexistence of different regular orbits at a time @xcite so that when one orbit destabilizes , another orbit ( with different current ) becomes available for transport ( the chaos is only in the transient from one stable motion to another ) .",
    "this is very similar to what described in ref .",
    "@xcite on the stabilization of the phase locking dynamics of long josephson junctions .    for other values of the parameter range",
    ", many different regular orbits can be stabilized for different values of the phase , as in the case of @xmath54 .",
    "note that in this case the particle motion is regular almost everywhere . nevertheless , an average of the mean velocity over all different values of the phase for values as @xmath39 and @xmath54 will give almost zero , because of the mixing up of orbits with opposite velocities .",
    "this has important consequences in the case of an ensemble of particles with random phases , as discussed below .",
    "the last case shown in figure  3 , @xmath55 , corresponds to the second end of the whole interval considered in figure  1 ( this region is chaotic for @xmath26 ) .",
    "interestingly , while in the in - phase case the subharmonic driver has no effects on this chaos , for some values of the phase ( again near @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) the subharmonic field can induce the stabilization of regular orbits with mean velocities @xmath58 and @xmath31 . from this",
    "we can conclude that a weak subharmonic perturbation _ with an appropriate phase _ with respect to the internal driver can induce phase locking in parameter regions where only chaotic motion is present for the unperturbed system .",
    "the application of an external subharmonic driver has therefore relevant phase dependent effects on the ratchet dynamics .    in order to consider the phase averaged effect of a weak subharmonic signal on a set of particles",
    ", we have performed the same analysis of figure  2 but introducing a random phase @xmath59 for each particle @xmath60 .",
    "we used in this case a population of @xmath61 particles , @xmath38 , and again @xmath46 .",
    "results are shown in figure  4 .",
    "the results obtained in the cases @xmath62 and @xmath63 are also shown for comparison . according to figure  4 ,",
    "the phase averaging causes a reduction of the mean velocity in the main locked window , and the plateau is in this case poorly defined .",
    "note that although the width of the step is reduced with respect to the corresponding @xmath51 case ( dots ) , it is still slightly larger that the one in absence of subharmonic ( open squares )",
    ".    we also remark that the averaged mean velocity shown in figure  4 could lead to misleading conclusions . indeed , the values where the averaged mean velocity drops to zero seems coincide with the chaotic region of the unperturbed system around @xmath39 .",
    "one could then be tempted to conclude that the chaotic orbits are actually preserved in average , with no relevant stabilization effect .",
    "this , however , is not the case as one can see by calculating in the same range of parameters the average of the mean velocity _ absolute value _ , @xmath64 .",
    "the result is shown in the same fig .  4 , as a dashed line .",
    "the absolute value of the velocity is clearly well above zero for all values of @xmath12 , and we can conclude that the zero average of the velocity is due to the mixing of orbits with positive and negative velocities ( and not to the presence of chaotic orbits with zero mean velocity ) .",
    "we finally remark that the average on the phase leads to a lowering of the mean velocity , with a deviation of the current step from a straight segment , this being a consequence of the mixing of orbits with different velocities stabilized by different phases .",
    "in this work we addressed the study of the stabilization effect of a weak subharmonic field on the phase locked dynamics of a ratchet system .",
    "we found that , for fluctuating - force ratchets , the application of an external subharmonic driver suppresses chaos and stabilizes regular orbits over larger ranges of the internal driver amplitude .",
    "this phenomenon strongly depend on the relative phase of the internal and external drivers which can then be used as a control parameter in the stabilization of a particular ratchet motion",
    ".    it would be interesting to apply these ideas to real experimental devices such as , for example , ratchet particle separators @xcite .",
