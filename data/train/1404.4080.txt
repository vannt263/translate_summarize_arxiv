    "gowdy - symmetric solutions to einstein s field equations are useful test cases for studying key issues in cosmology , e.g.  questions related to strong cosmic censorship , spikes and the bkl conjecture",
    ". moreover , their investigation promises insights that clearly go beyond the realm of the homogeneous standard models .",
    "consequently , these spacetimes are of considerable interest  especially in mathematical general relativity .",
    "a particular class of gowdy - symmetric models has been introduced in a recent paper @xcite : the _ smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut ( sggtn ) solutions_. these spacetimes are generally not known in the form of exact solutions . instead",
    ", existence has been shown with abstract methods .",
    "the main result was that for any choice of two free functions , subject to a periodicity condition , a unique sggtn solution exists .",
    "each sggtn spacetime has a past cauchy horizon , and the two free functions describe the behaviour of the spacetime geometry as this horizon is approached .",
    "moreover , with the exception of particular `` singular cases '' , these solutions are generally expected to develop a second , future cauchy horizon .",
    "the goal of the present article is to investigate the nature of the initial constraint ( the periodicity condition ) , which restricts the choice of data at the past horizon .",
    "we will see that this condition is related to a topological feature of this horizon , namely the fact that the null generators have closed orbits .",
    "here , we extend the construction of sggtn spacetimes to situations with horizons ruled by non - closed generators .",
    "the resulting class of spacetimes turns out to again have two functional degrees of freedom , but a periodicity condition is not required anymore . note that many investigations of cosmological cauchy horizons in the literature assume closedness of the generators , mainly for technical reasons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is particularly interesting to study properties of spacetimes for which this assumption is violated .",
    "the following abstract investigation of sggtn solutions with a more general past horizon will be complemented by the construction of an exact family of solutions .",
    "this enables us to study some properties of such spacetimes in more detail .",
    "in particular , we construct and investigate extensions of the exact solutions through the cauchy horizons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sggtn ] we give an overview of the construction of sggtn solutions , which summarizes key steps in the local and global existence proofs presented in @xcite .",
    "afterwards , in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we generalize these models to incorporate cauchy horizons with non - closed null generators .",
    "the announced family of exact solutions within this class is then derived and studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : exact ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , we discuss our findings .",
    "we start by summarizing some properties of the class of smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut ( sggtn ) solutions , before we generalize these models in the next section .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the sggtn cosmological models are gowdy - symmetric vacuum solutions to einstein s field equations with spatial three - sphere topology @xmath0 .",

    "the spatial coordinates are defined in the regions @xmath10 in the following we will outline how existence of globally hyperbolic solutions was shown in the time interval @xmath11 . also note that an important property of the sggtn models is their extendibility beyond this domain as non - globally hyperbolic spacetimes , very similar to the famous taub solution @xcite and its extensions to taub - nut @xcite .    in our coordinates , the two killing vectors corresponding to gowdy - symmetry can be chosen to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the norm of @xmath12 is @xmath14 , which vanishes at @xmath15 , provided @xmath7 is bounded there .",
    "indeed , the sggtn solutions have a past cauchy horizon at @xmath15 '' or `` at @xmath16 '' , even though , strictly speaking , our coordinates break down there .",
    "but what we actually mean , of course , are the boundaries that formally correspond to @xmath17 in suitable regular coordinates .",
    "similarly , we will often simply call certain killing vectors `` generators '' of a cauchy horizon , even though the actual generators , i.e.  the tangent vectors to the corresponding null geodesics , are only proportional to , but not identical with these vectors .",

    "afterwards it was shown that the first - order equations for @xmath9 are then integrable , provided the asymptotic data satisfy a periodicity condition .",
    "more precisely , the following local existence result has been shown .",

    "satisfying the following uniform expansions at @xmath15 : @xmath37    this theorem also shows that the sggtn models have two degrees of freedom , namely the two smooth functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , subject to the periodicity condition .",
    "once local existence was ensured , global existence in the time interval @xmath40 followed from a result due to chruciel @xcite .",
    "note that the line element degenerates at @xmath15 and at @xmath16 .",
    "the degeneracy at @xmath15 comes from a coordinate singularity at the cauchy horizon ( which can be removed by introducing suitable regular coordinates ) .",
    "however , since the global existence result does only apply for @xmath41 , the question about the behaviour at @xmath16 , where the metric again degenerates , remained .    in order to study the situation at @xmath16 , it is useful to reformulate the two einstein equations , for @xmath7 and @xmath8 in form of the ernst equation @xmath42 for the complex ernst potential @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 with @xmath48 interestingly , the ernst equation belongs to the remarkable class of integrable equations , i.e.  there is an associated linear matrix problem which is equivalent to the original nonlinear equation via its integrability condition .",

    "but he could also travel to point @xmath243 and further towards the hyperbola .",
    "what happens there ?",
    "it turns out that the divergence of @xmath244 and @xmath245 ( as a consequence of a diverging @xmath212 ) is due to a coordinate singularity . roughly speaking",

    "also note that @xmath259    the region above the hyperbola branch @xmath225 corresponds to coordinate values @xmath260 .",
    "however , since nothing special happens at @xmath261 in terms of the new coordinates , we may extend the solution to @xmath262 .",

    "the region @xmath263 `` beyond '' @xmath225 corresponds to the same coordinate values of @xmath168 and @xmath193 as the shaded region in fig .  [ fig : ext]c .",

    "consequently , the values of the metric potentials change as well .",
    "moreover , we still have that @xmath264 , but also @xmath212 , which was positive for @xmath260 , is now negative .",
    "this leads to a sign change of the metric components @xmath244 and @xmath245 , such that @xmath168 is now a spatial coordinate and @xmath193 is again the time coordinate .",

    "[ fig : ext]c ) or bounded ( if the slice hits the horizon @xmath214 ) . hence , unlike the spatially compact gowdy square , the region beyond @xmath214 is spatially unbounded and therefore not a cosmological model in the usual sense .",

    "we can also carry over the explicit construction of the metric at @xmath16 in terms of the data at @xmath15 , which shows that the solutions tend to develop a second cauchy horizon there .",
    "as before , the only exceptions are singular cases in which curvature singularities form at the boundary @xmath16 . whether this is the case can be read off from the data at the past horizon .",
