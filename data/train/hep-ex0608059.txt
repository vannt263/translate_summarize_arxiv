    "a generic calculation of neutrino event rates for detectors at various locations in the numi neutrino beam has been done .",
    "only flux , probability , cross sections and rudimentary energy reconstruction is considered .",
    "no particular detector technology is assumed .",
    "this document gives a calculation of neutrino flux and interaction rates for detectors placed in the various locations in the numi beam at 810 km from the target .",
    "four off - axis locations are considered : 6 km ( 7.4 mrad ) , 12 km ( 14.8 mrad ) , 30 km ( 37.0 mrad ) and 40 km ( 49.4 mrad ) .",
    "neutrino flux calculations are performed using the geant3 based gnumi simulation program .",
    "the proton beam , target , focussing horns , decay tunnel and other elements are models of what is currently in use by minos .",
    "the locations of the two focusing horns with respect to the target can focus the neutrino parents to produce different spectra .",
    "the so called `` low energy '' ( le ) and `` pseudo medium energy '' ( pme ) tuning are used to confirm the simulation against measured minos near detector data while the `` medium energy '' tuning is used for spectra at 810 km to match .",
    "table  [ tab : beams ] summarizes the beam tunings used . in all cases a 120 gev primary proton beam is used .",
