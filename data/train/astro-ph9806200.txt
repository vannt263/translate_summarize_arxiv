    "optical and x - ray deep surveys have revealed a clear evolution in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , that their co - moving space density was much higher in the past than at present ( e.g. hawkins et al .",
    "luminous agns are inferred to have turned into fainter agns or non - agn objects ( e.g. padovani et al.1990 ) , due probably to decrease on cosmological time scales in the mass accretion rate onto the central black holes .",
    "recent radio ( e.g. miyoshi et al . 1995 ) and optical ( e.g. kormendy 1995 ) observations revealed a gaseous disk orbiting around a huge mass concentration , presumably a black hole , at the center of many nearby galaxies .",
    "in addition , low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) , with 210 kev luminosities of @xmath10 w ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath3 ) , have been discovered with x - rays in many nearby galaxies ( makishima et al .",
    "1994 ; ptak et al .",
    "1995 ; ishisaki et al . 1996",
    "; iyomoto et al . 1996 , 1997 ; terashima et al . 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , relic of the past agns may lurk in the center of many apparently normal galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , it has remained unclear whether these relics were long time ago actually luminous agns .    here",
    ", we identify the radio galaxy ngc  1316 ( fornax a ) as a relic of a past luminous agn .",
    "this is one of the brightest extra - galactic radio sources in the ghz band , and exhibits double radio lobes ( ekers et al .",
    "these lobes have allowed the first successful detection of inverse - compton x - rays , by _ rosat _ ( feigelson et al . 1995 ) and _ asca _ ( kaneda et al . 1995 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this in turm provides a reliable estimate of the magnetic field and synchrotron lifetime in the lobes . by comparing the lifetime with a tight upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of its nucleus ,",
    "we conclude that the activity of its nucleus has decreased markedly over the last @xmath12 gyr .",
    "we assume a distance of 16.9 mpc to ngc  1316 ( tully 1988 ) , corresponding to the hubble constant of @xmath13 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "all the errors refer to single - parameter 90% confidence limits .",
    "we mainly use the mksa units .",
    "in contrast to the bright radio lobes , the nucleus ( core ) of ngc  1316 is quite radio faint ; 0.026 jy at 4.8 ghz . ratio of the core flux to the total ( lobe + core ) flux of ngc  1316 becomes @xmath14 at 4.8 ghz , falling by two orders of magnitude below the general correlation seen between these two quantities of radio galaxies ( morganti et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "this suggests that the ngc  1316 nucleus is currently rather inactive , and the lobes are relic of the past activity ( e.g. ekers et al .",
    "a supporting evidence is that the nucleus is offset by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 kpc ) from the radio `` bridge '' connecting the two lobes .",
    "the bridge may be the jet axis in the past , while the offset may represent the galaxy proper motion after the jet activity ceased ( ekers et al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "the radio emission , however , generally carries only a minor fraction of the overall radiative power emitted by an agn , and this fraction scatters largely among different types of agns . for example , majority of seyfert galaxies do not show luminous core radio emission , radio jets , or radio lobes .",
    "then , it might be that the ngc  1316 nucleus simply switched from a `` radio - loud '' mode to a `` radio - quiet '' mode , rather than from active to inactive states .",
    "alternatively the nucleus may in fact be quite active at present , and the faintness of the radio nucleus may be a result of its obscuration from our line of sight as suggested by the symmetric lobe morphology . indeed , fabbiano et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported a significant optical extinction in the ngc  1316 nucleus .    to obtain a firmer estimate of the current activity of the nucleus of ngc  1316 , we clearly need information in the higher - energy photons , particularly x - rays .",
    "therefore , below we evaluate the x - ray activity of the ngc  1316 nucleus , utilizing the x - ray imaging data from _ rosat _ and the spectroscopic x - ray data from _",
    "kim et al . ( 1998 ) , using the _ rosat _ hri , reported that the x - ray nucleus of ngc  1316 is undetectable with the 0.12.4 kev flux @xmath17 @xmath18 w m@xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the nucleus may be absorbed by hydrogen column density @xmath19 higher than @xmath20 m@xmath7 as in type ii seyfert galaxies ( e.g. iwasawa 1995 ; ueno 1996 ; turner et al . 1997 ) , although kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) did not consider this .",
    "therefore in reference to the _ rosat users handbook _ , we converted their upper limit on the count rate into the intrinsic 210 kev luminosity of the nucleus , assuming a power - law spectrum of photon index 1.7 together with various values of @xmath19 .",
    "these upper limits are plotted in figure 1 as thin arrows , against the assumed absorption .",
    "while the nuclear x - ray luminosity is well constrained in the low @xmath19 range , it is not constrained at @xmath21 m@xmath7 due to the limited band pass of _",
    "the _ asca _ observation of ngc  1316 was made on 1994 january 11 for 35 ksec , with the gis ( gas imaging spectrometer ; ohashi et al .",
    "1996 , makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) in the normal ph mode and the sis ( solid - state imaging spectrometer ; bruke et al .",
    "1991 ) in the 2 ccd faint mode .",
    "these data were already used in paper i to detect the inverse - compton x - rays .",
    "as shown in figure 1b of paper i , the x - ray emission from ngc  1316 itself dominates the gis image , and the x - ray centroid coincides with the optical nucleus within the astrometric accuracy of _ asca _ ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we accumulated the gis and sis events over a circle of radii 4@xmath23 ( @xmath020 kpc ) and 3@xmath23 ( @xmath015 kpc ) centered on the x - ray centroid , respectively .",
    "these regions cover the nucleus and a significant portion of the optical galaxy , but excludes the radio lobes .",
    "we added the data from the two gis detectors ( gis2 and gis3 ) into a single gis spectrum , and the data from sis0 chip 1 and sis1 chip 3 into a single sis spectrum .",
    "the derived spectra are shown in figure 2 , after subtracting the background utilizing blank - sky observations .",
    "they exhibit a soft component with low - energy emission lines , and a featureless hard continuum .",
    "both these components are characteristic of elliptical galaxies , among which the former can be identified with the thermal emission from hot interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. forman et al .",
    "1985 ; canizares et al .",
    "1987 ; awaki et al .",
    "the hard component is basically interpreted as integrated hard x - rays from neutron - star binaries ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "1989 ; matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , but may be partially contributed by the active nucleus , because agn emission and the integrated x - ray binary emission often exhibit similar spectral shapes in the _ asca _ energy band .",
    "we fitted the gis and sis spectra jointly , with a spectral model consisting of a soft thermal plasma emission by raymond & smith ( 1977 ) and a power - law .",
    "we applied a common absorption to the two components , with @xmath19 fixed to the galactic value of @xmath24 m@xmath7 ( @xmath25 cm@xmath7 ) .",
    "the fit is successful with @xmath26 for 140 degrees of freedom .",
    "the raymond - smith component has a temperature of @xmath27 kev , a metallicity of @xmath28 solar , and a luminosity of @xmath29 w in 0.54 kev .",
    "these values are typical of the ism emission from elliptical galaxies .",
    "the power - law component has a photon index of @xmath30 , and a 210 kev luminosity of @xmath31 w.    thus , the hard component would be consistent with an llagn emission in its spectral shape alone .",
    "however , the value of @xmath32 compares with the optical b - band luminosity of ngc  1316 ( @xmath33 w at 16.9 mpc ; tully 1988 ) as @xmath34 .",
    "this ratio aligns with the general x - ray to optical correlation seen among nearby normal galaxies without llagns , @xmath35 , which was first derived with _ einstein _",
    "( e.g. forman et al .",
    "1985 ; canizares et al . 1987 ) and then updated using _",
    "ginga _ and _ asca _ ( makishima et al . 1989 ; matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ; reynolds et al . 1997 ; matsumoto et al . 1997 ) .",
    "since the correlation is thought to represent the dominant contribution of neutron - star binaries to @xmath32 , we infer that the hard component of ngc  1316 is also dominated by the integrated emission from neutron - star binaries , with little room for the llagn contribution .",
    "indeed , we can restore an acceptable spectral fit by replacing the power - law component with a bremsstrahlung model of temperature fixed at 10 kev , which simulates the binary - component spectrum ( makishima et al .",
    "1989 ; matsushita et al .",
    "the value of @xmath32 remained the same , and the soft - component parameters did not change significantly .",
    "therefore , the hard component is consistent with being entirely of the binary origin . even allowing for @xmath36% uncertainties in the @xmath37 correlation , the 210 kev luminosity of the ngc  1316 nucleus should not exceed @xmath38",
    "w. we show this limit in figure 1 by an arrow with circle .",
    "the above conclusion is insensitive to the nuclear absorption up to a column density of @xmath39 m@xmath7 .",
    "however the nucleus may be more heavily obscured , as seen in several llagns ( makishima et al .",
    "1994 ; iyomoto et al .",
    "accordingly , we refitted the gis and sis spectra by a three - component model , consisting of the raymond - smith component , the binary component , and an absorbed power - law of photon index 1.7 simulating the absorbed llagn emission . by fixing the column density of the power - law component at various values , we calculated the maximum power - law normalization allowed by the data .",
    "thick arrows in figure 1 represent the derived upper limits on the power - law luminosity , calculated in the 210 kev band after removing the absorption .",
    "thus , we can constrain the 210 kev luminosity of the nucleus as @xmath40 w over a wide range of nuclear obscuration up to 10@xmath41 m@xmath7 .    when the nuclear obscuration exceeds @xmath42 m@xmath7 , direct x - rays become almost invisible in the _ asca _ band .",
    "however , we still expect to see scattered continuum , and a fluorescent fe - k line ( e.g. makishima 1986 ) .",
    "such fe - k lines have been observed from many type ii seyferts ( e.g. koyama et al .",
    "1989 ; ueno et al . 1994",
    "; iwasawa et al . 1994 ; fabian et al .",
    "1994 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "1994 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "1997 ) and obscured llagns ( iyomoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , at typical equivalent widths of 12 kev with respect to the scattered continuum .",
    "accordingly we fitted the 310 kev portion of the gis / sis spectra with a single power - law plus a narrow gaussian line of which the center energy is fixed at 6.4 kev ( neutral fe - k line ) .",
    "then the fe - k line equivalent width has been constrained to be @xmath43 ev . therefore , the scattered continuum accounts for at most @xmath44 of the observed hard x - ray component . by correcting this for the scattering efficiency",
    ", we can constrain the intrinsic nuclear luminosity . although the scattering efficiency depends on geometry and ionization state of the scatterer",
    ", we may adopt a rough estimate of @xmath01% at 6 kev ( e.g. koyama et al . 1989 ) , to crudely constrain the intrinsic luminosity as @xmath45 w. this limit is also given in figure 1 by an arrow with square .",
    "we may quote further evidences supporting the current dormancy of the ngc  1316 nucleus .",
    "the [ oiii ] luminosity of ngc  1316 is lower than @xmath46 w ( at 16.9 mpc ; siebert et al .",
    "1996 ) , which corresponds to a 210 kev luminosity of @xmath47 w in view of the tight x - ray to [ oiii]@xmath485007 correlation in type i seyferts ( grossan 1992 ; mulchaey et al .",
    "the amounts of molecular and neutral hydrogen in ngc  1316 are estimated to be 8.95 @xmath49 using sco line , and @xmath50 using 21 cm line , respectively . these are no higher than those in normal e / s0 galaxies ( roberts et al .",
    "1991 ) , indicating that the nucleus lacks sufficient fueling material .",
    "infrared flux densities of ngc  1316 , 0.25 jy at 25 @xmath51 m and 3.0 jy at 60 @xmath51 m , are similar to or even lower than those of normal e / s0 galaxies ( green et al .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the x - rays from a luminous agn are converted into infrared by the obscuring material .",
    "all these properties support the conclusion from the radio and x - ray observations , that the nucleus is in the state of very low activity .",
    "while the nucleus of ngc  1316 is currently nearly dormant as discussed in  2 , it must have been much more active previously because it had to power the lobes .",
    "then , when did the activity decline ?",
    "the inverse - compton x - rays from ngc  1316 are produced when the radio - emitting relativistic electrons in the lobes scatter off the cosmic microwave photons . comparing the radio and x - ray brightness",
    ", the magnetic field strength in the lobes of ngc  1316 has been determined unambiguously to be 0.3 nt ( feigelson et al .",
    "1995 ; paper i ) , without relying upon the usual assumption of energy equipartition .",
    "in addition , the lobe radio spectrum is known to extend at least to 5 ghz without a noticeable spectral turn over ( brinkmann et al .",
    "1994 [ 408 mhz ] ; jones et al .",
    "1992 [ 843 mhz ] ; ekers et al .",
    "1983 [ 1415 mhz ] ; wall et al .",
    "1973 [ 2700 mhz ] ; morganti et al",
    ". 1993 [ 4.8 ghz ] ) .",
    "then , it is a textbook case to calculate that the electrons emitting 5 ghz radio photons lose half the energy on a characteristic time scale of @xmath52 gyr .",
    "this @xmath53 gives a reliable measure of the synchrotron life time of the lobes of ngc  1316 .",
    "that is , the nucleus must have been active until at least @xmath53 years ago , or even to a more recent epoch .",
    "the @xmath54 ( 30 kpc ) offset between the nucleus and the bridge provides another clue .",
    "since ngc  1316 is a member of the fornax cluster of which the velocity dispersion is @xmath55 km s@xmath3 ( ferguson & sandage 1990 ) , the time required for the nucleus to travel this distance may be @xmath56 gyr ( 30 kpc divided by @xmath55 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this must be a lower limit on the time elapsed since the jet ceased , as the bridge must have a non - zero lifetime .",
    "the first of the above two arguments suggests that the activity decline time scale @xmath57 is shorter than @xmath58 0.08 gyr , while the second one requires @xmath57 to be longer than @xmath59 0.1 gyr . to satisfy both these conditions ,",
    "@xmath60 gyr is required .",
    "the remaining task is to estimate how powerful the nucleus used to be . for this purpose , we note that the electron energy density in the lobes have been constrained in paper i to be @xmath61 j m@xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the distance and @xmath64 is volume filling factor of the relativistic electrons . by multiplying this with the lobe volume of @xmath65 m@xmath66 , we estimate the electron energy contained in the lobes to be @xmath67 j ( assuming @xmath68 1 ) . since this energy is radiated away on the synchrotron lifetime of @xmath69 gyr , a kinetic power of at least @xmath70 w is needed to sustain the lobes in a steady - state condition .",
    "there is a good correlation between kinetic luminosities and narrow line luminosities of agns over five orders of magnitude ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ; ceolotti & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "the luminosity of [ oiii ] , the strongest narrow emission line , in turn correlates well with the x - ray continuum luminosity over five orders of magnitude ( grossan 1992 ; mulchaey et al .",
    "from these two correlations , we infer that the nucleus of ngc  1316 used to have a 210 kev luminosity of @xmath7110@xmath72 w or larger .",
    "however we admit that the above two correlations are both subject to significant intrinsic scatters , so that the derived x - ray luminosity is a very crude estimate .",
    "we may rather argue that typical radio galaxies have 0.54 kev luminosities ( to which the 210 kev luminosities should be comparable ) in the range @xmath73 w ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1984 ) , and none of the llagns mentioned in  1 exhibits prominent radio lobes .",
    "using the _ asca _ data , we have shown that the nucleus of ngc  1316 is at present very inactive , with the 210 kev luminosity less than @xmath74 w ( @xmath75 erg s@xmath3 ) over a wide range of obscuration up to 10@xmath41 m@xmath7 .",
    "this agrees with the extreme faintness of the radio core .",
    "in contrast , the nucleus must have been previously as luminous as @xmath76 w in the 210 kev x - rays .",
    "these indicate that the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole of ngc  1316 decreased by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "our x - ray constraints become rather loose for nuclear obscuration higher than @xmath42 m@xmath7 , but the available data in other wavelengths altogether suggest that such a heavy obscuration is rather unlikely .    furthermore , using the estimate of the lobe life times and the observed nucleus vs. bridge offset , we have shown that the activity decline took place in the last @xmath60 gyr .",
    "these results reveal a large decrease in the agn activity of ngc  1316 , and provide one of the first convincing examples that the activity of an agn can actually turn - off .",
    "objets like ngc  1316 must be statistically rather rare , because its turn - off took place over a time scale which is much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "its lobes are currently disappearing , and in another 0.1 gyr or so , ngc  1316 will be a quite normal elliptical galaxy without any trace of the past agn activity .",
    "this suggests that a certain fraction of currently normal galaxies used to be luminous agns in the past , although quantitative estimates are difficult with only one example . in conclusion , the fascinating case of ngc  1316 supports the scenario that the past quasars turned into normal galaxies .",

    "<S> ngc  1316 ( fornax  a ) is a radio galaxy with prototypical double lobes , where the magnetic field intensity is accurately measured via the inverse - compton technique . </S>",
    "<S> the radio - emitting electrons in the lobes are inferred to have a synchrotron life time of @xmath0 0.1 gyr . considering the lobe energetics </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the past nuclear x - ray luminosity of ngc  1316 to be at least @xmath1 w ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the nucleus was rather active at least 0.1 gyr ago . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we confirmed with _ </S>",
    "<S> asca _ and _ rosat _ that the nucleus of ngc  1316 is very faint in x - rays at present , with the 210 kev luminosity of any agn - like hard component being @xmath4 w ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) even assuming a nuclear obscuration up to @xmath6 m@xmath7 ( 10@xmath8 cm@xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is at least an order of magnitude lower than the estimated past activity , indicating that the nucleus is presently very inactive . </S>",
    "<S> from these two results , we conclude that the nucleus of ngc  1316 has become dormant during the last 0.1 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the possible abundance of `` dormant '' quasars in nearby galaxies . </S>"
