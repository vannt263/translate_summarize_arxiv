    "paczyski & stanek ( 1998 ) found that the @xmath1 colors of clump giants in baade s window were anomalous in the sense that at fixed @xmath8 , they were redder in @xmath9 than clump giants in the solar neighborhood by 0.2 mag .",
    "stutz , popowski , & gould ( 1999 ) found a similar offset ( 0.17 mag ) for rr lyrae stars in baade s window compared to those in the solar neighborhood .",
    "popowski ( 2000 ) showed that part of these offsets was simply due to errors in the original photometry used by both groups . when he incorporated the revised ogle photometry of paczyski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , he found that the offset in @xmath10 shrank to @xmath11 mag in both cases .",
    "popowski ( 2000 ) then reviewed the various attempts to explain such an offset in terms of a difference between the intrinsic properties of stars in the two populations , an idea advanced by paczyski ( 1998 ) and by stutz et al .",
    "he argued that such an explanation was not impossible , but unlikely , and that a more plausible explanation is that the ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath12 adopted by both paczyski & stanek ( 1998 ) and stutz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from stanek ( 1996 ) was incorrect .",
    "both color anomalies could be solved , he noted , by adopting @xmath13 .",
    "popowski ( 2000 ) used this re - evaluation to draw various conclusions about the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "in the course of calibrating a @xmath14-band clump - giant distance indicator and applying it to measure the distance modulus of the baade s window bulge field , alves ( 2000 ) measured @xmath15 .",
    "he did so by comparing the @xmath1 colors of his 20-star sample of baade s window clump giants taken from tiede , frogel , & terndrup ( 1995 ) with the @xmath1 colors of local clump stars .",
    "here we improve on the alves ( 2000 ) measurement by incorporating a factor @xmath16 more stars into the analysis , i.e. , all 138 g0-k4 giants with @xmath1 photometry from tiede et al .",
    "we determine @xmath4 by comparing these @xmath1 colors to the @xmath1 colors of nearby stars as determined by bessell & brett ( 1988 ) .",
    "we find , @xmath17 this reduces the color anomalies to @xmath18mag and so qualitatively confirms popowski s ( 2000 ) explanation of them .",
    "to measure @xmath4 , we assume that the @xmath1 colors of giant stars in baade s window as measured by tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are intrinsically the same as those in solar neighborhood as determined by bessell & brett ( 1988 ) .",
    "( we will partially test this assumption below . )",
    "bessel & brett ( 1988 ) give @xmath1 colors from g0 to m5 , that is , over the color range @xmath19 .",
    "however , there is considerable evidence that the spectral energy distributions of m giants ( at fixed spectral type ) differ significantly between baade s window and the solar neighborhood ( frogel & whitford 1982 , 1987 ; tiede et al .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the @xmath2 color - color relation is different , and in fact we will present evidence below that it is not .",
    "however , to be conservative , we restrict consideration to @xmath20 , which eliminates all m giants and k5 giants as well . that is , @xmath21 we begin with the sample of 509 stars with optical and infrared photometry from the bw4b field of tiede et al .",
    "note that the columns headed `` @xmath22 '' and `` @xmath9 '' in that paper actually give @xmath23 and @xmath10 .",
    "we recover the original @xmath14 magnitudes by adding @xmath24 , as indicated by table 1 of tiede et al .",
    "we then obtain @xmath8 using visual extinctions , @xmath25 , from stanek s ( 1996 ) extinction map together with the relation , @xmath26 note that the stanek ( 1996 ) map ( available by anonymous ftp at astro.princeton.edu , stanek / extinction ) has been corrected to the zero point found by gould , popowski , & terndrup ( 1998 ) and alcock et al .",
    "these authors made their zero - point determinations by comparing the @xmath27 colors of local k giants and rr lyrae stars , respectively , with the @xmath27 colors of similar stars in baade s window , making use of the extinction ratio given by equation ( [ eqn : avk ] ) .",
    "hence , for consistency , we use the same ratio here .    of the original 509 tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) stars , 185 lack @xmath28 photometry . of the remainder , 86 lack @xmath25 measurements because they fall within @xmath29 of ngc 6522 where stanek ( 1996 ) found the @xmath25 determinations to be unreliable .",
    "a further 96 stars are bluer than the color interval ( [ eqn : besrange ] ) , and an additional 4 stars are redder .",
    "this leaves a total of 138 stars .",
    "for each of these 138 stars , we use linear interpolation to estimate the @xmath30 predicted from their measured @xmath8 and the bessell & brett ( 1988 ) @xmath1 color - color relation .",
    "we then fit the data to a two - parameter model @xmath31 , \\label{eqn : linfit}\\ ] ] where the offset 2.348 is chosen to eliminate the correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we remove outliers as follows .",
    "we do the fit using all the data , and determine the `` errors '' by forcing @xmath34 per degree of freedom to unity .",
    "we find the largest @xmath35 outlier , eliminate it , and repeat the process .",
    "we stop when the largest outlier is less than @xmath36 .",
    "this eliminates six outliers .",
    "we find , @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{eqn : alphabeta}\\ ] ] since @xmath38 , we obtain equation ( [ eqn : rvi ] ) . from the fact that @xmath33 is consistent with zero at the @xmath39 level , we conclude that the shift from @xmath10 to @xmath9 depends only on @xmath25 and not on the color of the star .",
    "we therefore set @xmath40 and show our resulting fit in figure [ fig : one ] .",
    "note that since @xmath4 will in general be a function of color or spectral type , our measurement should be taken as applying to stars at the mean of our sample , @xmath41 , i.e. , k0 giants .",
    "our value , @xmath42 , is in good agreement with the one found by alves ( 2000 ) , @xmath15 , and the one adopted by tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , @xmath43 .    also plotted on figure [ fig : one ] are the four stars ( _ open circles _ ) that were excluded from the fit because they were too red .",
    "note that they lie very close to the local @xmath1 curve of bessell & brett ( 1988 ) .",
    "if we repeat the entire procedure including these four stars , we obtain @xmath44 .",
    "\\label{eqn : alphabeta2}\\ ] ] with four outliers excluded .",
    "that is @xmath45 , essentially identical to equation ( [ eqn : rvi ] ) . in either case , the slope @xmath33 is consistent with zero , indicating that our determination is not a signficant function of spectral type .",
    "this non - dependence on @xmath8 color appears to be in strong conflict with figure 14 of tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) which shows a large number of points in the range @xmath46 that lie @xmath47 mag below the bessell & brett ( 1988 ) relation .",
    "in fact , all the points with ccd @xmath28 photometry from tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) lie close to the line ( as they do in our fig.[fig : one ] ) .",
    "the remaining points are from frogel , whitford & rich ( 1984 ) and frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) who obtained their own single - channel infrared data , but relied on the earlier photographic data of whitford & blanco ( 1979 ) and arp ( 1965 ) for the @xmath28 photometry . from the small overlap between these older photographic data and the ccd photometry reported in tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we estimate that the earlier photographic photometry may have a zero - point error of @xmath47 mag in @xmath10 in the sense of being too blue .",
    "if this zero - point error is confirmed by future observations , it would mean that the @xmath2 color - color relation is the same for baade s window and the solar neighborhood , but not necessarily the correspondance between colors anad spectral type .",
    "nevertheless , to be conservative , we base our results only on the g0k4 sample .",
    "as with essentially all methods for determining total and selective extinction , our measurement relies on the assumption that the colors of stars in baade s window are the same as those in the solar neighborhood . if the mean @xmath9 color at fixed @xmath8 differed between the two populations by @xmath48 , then our estimate of @xmath32 would likewise be in error by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mean value of @xmath25 over our final sample of 132 stars .",
    "however , from the fact that @xmath33 is consistent with zero ( eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : alphabeta ] ] ) , such an offset would have to be independent of spectal type from g0 to k4 ( and arguably to m5 ) .",
    "this seems quite implausible .",
    "in addition , approximately the same offset would have to apply to rr lyrae stars ( stutz et al .",
    "most probably , the fault lies not in the stars , but in the dust .",
    "popowski ( 2000 ) reexamined the woniak & stanek ( 1996 ) method by which stanek ( 1996 ) determined @xmath51 . making use of the original tests done by woniak & stanek ( 1996 )",
    ", he found that this determination depends in part on an initial assumption about @xmath4 so that values as low as @xmath52 would be consistent with the data .",
    "our measurement of @xmath4 removes most , but not all , of the anomalous color problems found by paczyski & stanek ( 1998 ) and by stutz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "popowski s ( 2000 ) revised offset @xmath53 mag is now reduced to @xmath54 , and so is only a @xmath55 discrepancy . however , for the clump giant anomaly found by paczyski & stanek ( 1998 ) , the formal uncertainty is only @xmath56 mag , so statistical fluctuations do not provide a plausible explanation . nevertheless , the remaining discrepancy is small and may be due to a combination of small offsets between the photometric zero points of the various measurement systems that are used to make the comparison .",
    "paczyski et al .  ( 1999 ) used @xmath57 from stanek ( 1996 ) to deredden the observed centroid of the clump in their @xmath28 color - magnitude diagram of baade s window .",
    "the zero point of their @xmath23-band extinctions is based on gould et al.(1998 ) and alcock et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and is not affected by the present paper .",
    "however , the @xmath58-band photometry should be adjusted fainter by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the value we determine here and @xmath61 is the mean extinction of clump stars measured by paczyski et al .",
    "this adjustment yields a clump centroid of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the color is only 0.05 mag redward of the centroid of the hipparcos clump ( paczyski et al .",

    ", we obtain a distance modulus to baade s window @xmath63 where we have adopted [ fe / h]@xmath64 .",
