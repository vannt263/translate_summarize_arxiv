    "it has recently been shown that there exists a macroscopic quantum phase difference in processes connected with atomic waves .",
    "namely , this effect is observed between two tunnel - coupled bose - einstein condensates @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the coupling occurs due to a trap potential which has the form of a double - well potential .",
    "the theoretical investigation shows that here is possibly an interesting phenomenon of periodic oscillations of the atomic population between condensates and quantum self - trapping of population in the dependence of the relative phase between condensates @xcite-@xcite .",
    "analogous phenomena which have been studied are the ac josephson effect @xcite and the periodic exchange of power and switching of electromagnetic waves between cores in nonlinear optical couplers @xcite .    in particular",
    ", there is a direct analogy between the tunneling phenomena in two prolongated bose - einstein condensates and two tunnel - coupled single mode optical fibers . in this optical analogy ,",
    "the role of the chemical potential is played the propagation constant , and to the nonlinear interaction between atoms is analogous to the kerr nonlinearity of optical media .",
    "the tunnnel - coupling arising from the overlaps of the electromagnetic fields outside of dielectric cilinders ( fibers)@xcite exactly corresponds to the tunnel coupling between two bose - einstein condensates due to the overlaps of the wavefunctions .    in this context , it is natural to investigate the influence of a time varying coupling on the quantum coherent tunneling process . in the nonlinear optical coupler analogy",
    "this corresponds to the variation in the longitudinal direction coupling @xcite .",
    "as was shown recently , the variation in time of the trap potential can lead to resonant oscillations of the bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of the gross - pitaevsky equation shows that the rapid variation in time of the trap potential can lead to a bifurcation of the effective ( averaged ) form of the trap potential and consequently to splitting of the bec @xcite .    from what we have said above",
    ", we could wait for new phenomena in the process of quantum coherent atomic tunneling ( qcat ) process too .",
    "recalling the analogy with josephson effects in coupled junctions , we note that in the last case it is very difficult to produce such kind of effects , the difficulty coming from the fact that it is hard to implement the time varying overlap properties of junctions .",
    "thus , in this article we will study the atomic tunneling between two tunnel - coupled bec s in a double - well _ time dependent _ trap .",
    "namely , in section ii we will study the nonlinear resonance phenomena in the interference and , in particular , the stationary regimes , with damping taked into account .",
    "the phase and population damping are considered as well .",
    "the phase locked states are interesting because the suppression in these states of the fluctuations of the relative phase between two condensates .",
    "the regions of regular and chaotic oscillations of the relative atomic population are calculated in section iii , using the melnikov function approach . in section",
    "iv the macroscopic quantum interference in two overlapped condensates with rapidly varying traps is investigated .",
    "we derive the system of averaged equations for coupled modes and define in section v new regimes of parameters for the macroscopic quamtum self - trapping ( mqst ) .",
    "the problem of bose - einstein condensates in a two double - well time dependent trap can be described by the following model @xmath2 where the parameters @xmath3 are defined by the overlaps integrals of the time dependent gross - pitaevsky eigenfunctions as given in @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 are parameters of nonlinear interactions between atoms and @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the atomic scattering length .",
    "the attractive case can be obtained analogously , using symmetries of the equation this system of equations is valid in the approximation of a weak link between condensates .",
    "comparison with the numerical solution of gpe shows that the system ( [ basic ] ) is a reasonable approximation for @xmath7 for the strongly overlapped condensates the system should be modified . for a periodically varying @xmath8 we have limitations on the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "for which the two - mode approximation is valid .",
    "the small deformation of bound states requires @xmath11 . to avoid the resonances of the modulations with normal modes of the spherical",
    "well we should require that the difference of energy between the ground state and the first normal mode be larger than the modulation energy , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath13 , @xcite , where @xmath14 is the harmonic oscillator frequency , we find the condition @xmath15 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath16  the frequency of the linear oscillations of the atomic population , defined by the tunneling frequency , we conclude that by a proper choice of parameters we can have the resonant case @xmath17 or the rapidly varying modulation @xmath18 .    introducing new variables @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21",
    "are respectively the number of atoms and phases in i - th trap , we get the following system @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the positive and negative atomic scattering length respectively . in",
    "what follows , we will consider the case @xmath25 , ( @xmath26 ) , if not stated otherwise .",
    "we have included in eq([tun ] ) the damping term @xmath27 .",
    "it appears if we take into account a noncoherent dissipative current of normal - state atoms , proportional to the chemical potential difference @xmath28 . for the other type of overlapping condensate there might be another type of damping .",
    "for example , for the two interacting condensates with different hyperfine levels in a single harmonic trap the damping has the form @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the unperturbed system ( @xmath30 const,@xmath31 const , @xmath32 ) is @xmath33    let us consider the case of periodic modulations of the tunnel coupling parameter , when @xmath34 and the time - periodic energy difference is @xmath35 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the parameter @xmath36 , which is a slow - varying function of the time in a comparison with the period @xmath10 .",
    "the averaged system of equations can be found by averaging over the period of fast oscillations @xmath37 .",
    "doing so , we get the system @xmath38    let us now look for the fixed points of eq.([av ] )",
    ". introduce first the notation @xmath39 . from the system ( [ av ] ) we find the following equation for the fixed points @xmath40 for small @xmath41 we can find the explicit solution @xmath42    the existence of a stationary solution is connected with the circumstance that the damping of the oscillation in quantum tunneling is compensated by the periodic variation of the trap . in",
    "reference@xcite the influence of the damping on the macroscopic quantum interference has been investigated numerically and degradation of the interference due to damping has been analyzed .",
    "the predicted stationary solutions , where these effects are compensated by the variable driving , are indeed phase - locked solutions .",
    "thus we can think that the fluctuations of the relative phase will be suppressed in such states .",
    "it is an important prediction since bec s have phase fluctuations and it is difficult to maintain the constant relative phase of condensates",
    ". this phenomenon can be useful to develop the phase standard for the bose - einstein condensate- a problem attracting considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the value of fixed points for an experimental situation .",
    "for example , when @xmath43 , we obtain the fixed points @xmath44 .",
    "stability analysis shows that only the first point is stable and corresponds to the global attractor .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations of the initial system for the relative population @xmath45 are presented in fig.1 .",
    "it shows that the agreement between theory and numerical simulations is good .",

    "the two component condensates where two different hyperfine states can be populated and confined in the same trap .",
    "a weak driving field couples two internal states and as result the oscillations in the relative population will occur @xcite . in this case",
    "the damping term has the form @xmath46 . repeating the above mentioned procedure we obtain the averaged system @xmath47    in the model @xcite",
    ", @xmath48 corrsponds to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are chemical potentials and @xmath51 is frequency detuning @xmath52 , @xmath14 is the separation in frequency of two hyperfine states , @xmath14 is the frequency of drive .",
    "the fixed points are : @xmath53 here @xmath54 .",

    "all solutions decay to the first fixed point .",
    "in this section we consider the interference in the system which in some limit is mathematically equivalent to the motion of a particle in a double - well potential under parametric periodic perturbations .",
    "the particle motion is of course unharmonic and the nonlinear resonances between oscillations of a particle and oscillations of the trap potential are possible .",
    "one of consequences of this is the possible appearence of chaotic dynamics in such systems .",
    "we will now study the conditions for the appearence of the chaotic dynamics in atomic tunneling .    to proceed",
    "it will be useful first to consider some aspects of the unperturbed system , that is , when the coupling is constant . in this case the system ( [ tun ] ) is equivalent to the quartic ( duffing ) oscillator @xcite .",

    "this case corresponds to the periodic flux of atoms from one bec to other . when @xmath68 the motion of effective particle is confined in the one of the wells .",
    "this case corresponds to the localization of atomic population in one of the condensates - the so called macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) .",
    "the case @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath70 , corresponds to the separatrix solution separating these two regimes .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the dynamics of atomic population , when the inital parameters @xmath71 are close to the separatrix of the unperturbed systsem . from the general theory of nonlinear driven oscillations",
    "@xcite we can expect the appearence of _ chaotic macroscopic tunneling phenomena_.    the separatrix solutions for the right hand side well(condensate ) are : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the motion near the separatrix is very sensitive to the change of the initial condition and a stochastic layer appeas , leading to the chaotic dynamics of the solutions of the system ( [ tun ] ) .",
    "the melnikov function method is effective to find the regions of chaotic behavior @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ tun ] ) may written in the form @xmath74 and has a hyperbolic fixed point . according to this method",
    ", we need to calculate the melnikov function @xmath75 @xmath76 as is well known , the existence of zeros of @xmath77 indicates the intersection of separatrices and the existence of homoclinical chaos .",
    "substituting the expressions for @xmath78 from the system ( [ tun ] ) and calculating the integrals , we find the final expressions for the melnikov function",
    ". we shall give the results for two possible damping terms .",
    "the integrations in ( [ m ] ) are cumbersome , and will be omitted .",

    "we plot this criterion in the @xmath84 plane for @xmath85 .",
    "regions below the curve correspond to regular oscillations and above to chaotic oscillations of @xmath45 .",
    "the criterion gives a good lower bound on the region of chaos in this plane .",
    "we verified this lower bound in ( @xmath86 ) plane by numerical simulations and found a good agreement with the formulae ( [ holmes1 ] ) .",
    "when the damping coefficient is zero we have the expression for the width of stochastic layer near the separatrix as @xmath87    in fig.4 we plot the width of the stochastic layer as a function of the frequency for @xmath88 .",
