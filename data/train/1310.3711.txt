    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies provide a particularly clean probe of the universe at the time of decoupling , @xmath0 years after the big bang , and have allowed constraints to be placed on cosmological parameters at the 1% level .",
    "@xcite measurement of cmb polarization at large angular scales also provides information about the very early universe and physics at grand - unified - theory energy scales through its sensitivity to a primordial gravitational - wave background ( gwb ) .",
    "many models of inflation predict that such a gwb should exist , and a gwb would leave a unique odd - parity pattern , termed `` b modes , '' in the cmb polarization.@xcite    the magnitude of the gravitational - wave b - mode signal is known to be less than 100nk .",
    "@xcite from the ground , this signal must be viewed through an atmosphere of 520k in antenna temperature , which can fluctuate by tens of mk on minute time scales .",
    "@xcite rapid signal modulation is a well - known technique first used by dicke in radio astronomy ,  @xcite and cmb polarization experiments have used a number of modulation schemes .",
    "rapid modulation of linear polarization by a half - wave plate ( hwp )  @xcite is one of the most promising modulation techniques to separate the cmb b - mode signal from the large unpolarized atmosphere for instruments with large optical throughput and large numbers of pixels .",
    "@xcite    here we report results from using a hwp on the atacama b - mode search ( abs ) instrument to modulate the incident polarization at a rate well above the @xmath1 knee of the atmospheric emission . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", abs is the first experiment to use a rapidly - rotating hwp on a ground - based cmb experiment . using a demodulation procedure , we find that the polarized signal band is free from atmospheric contamination at the level of 0.1% of that in the raw intensity signal .",
    "this allows the noise in the demodulated tod to integrate down as @xmath2 over the time scales of 1000 seconds and demonstrates the ability of ground - based cmb experiments to recover cmb polarization over large angular scales . in the constant - elevation scans done by abs",
    ", this facilitates recovery of modes perpendicular to the scan direction with wavelengths up to 24@xmath3 , corresponding to multipoles @xmath4 4090 , even in the presence of strong atmospheric emission .",
    "this multipole range is crucial for cosmology as the inflationary gravitational - wave signal is expected to peak at @xmath5 .",
    "the technique of fast modulation also makes it unnecessary to difference the timestreams of paired detectors sensitive to two orthogonal linear polarizations . without fast modulation ,",
    "a ground - based experiment using bolometric polarimeters usually achieves some rejection of atmospheric fluctuations by pair differencing in the analysis pipeline .",
    "this differencing requires that both detectors in a pair be functional , with well - understood and stable responsivity ratios , reducing detector array efficiency and overall sensitivity . for abs",
    ", the two detectors in a pair can operate independently .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the atacama b - mode search ( abs ) is a 145 ghz receiver consisting of 240 feedhorn - coupled polarimeters with 480 transition - edge sensors ( teses ) that operate at a base temperature of 300 mk .",
    "the target bandpass for abs is 127160 ghz ; however , approximately half of the array has a shifted bandpass attributed to unplanned changes in the index of refraction of the silicon - dioxide microstrip dielectric on the detector wafers .",
    "these detectors have a bandpass of 140170 ghz with a broader cutoff at the high - frequency side , making those detectors more susceptible to contamination from the water line of the atmosphere at 183ghz .",
    "cryogenic 60-cm primary and secondary reflectors in a crossed - dragone configuration couple the focal plane to the sky with 35@xmath6 full width half maximum ( fwhm ) beams and a 22@xmath3 field of view .",

    "abs is located next to the atacama cosmology telescope ( act)@xcite at an altitude of 5190 m , on cerro toco in the atacama desert of northern chile .",
    "abs is unique among current and planned cmb polarization experiments in modulating the incoming polarization using an ambient - temperature , continuously - rotating hwp .",

    "this level of emission would degrade system sensitivity by approximately 6% . in - field",
    "characterization of loading is on - going , with warm optics estimated to add 8k of loading .",
    "this is an upper limit on hwp loading , as we have reason to believe that some excess loading comes from sources other than the hwp , including diffraction onto warm elements or unexpected emission from the hwp anti - reflection coating .",
    "we are working to reduce this excess warm loading .",

    "an incremental encoder disc with an index to mark the zero point is used to read out the hwp angle with @xmath9 resolution .",
    "the hwp is placed at the entrance aperture of the telescope directly above the vacuum window and is the first optical element in the path of light from the sky to the focal plane , allowing for a clear separation of sky polarization and instrument polarization .",
    "the location is also designed to be the beam waist of the ensemble of the detectors so that the detectors share the same hwp surface and some of the systematics originating from the hwp can be removed as a common mode among detectors . figure  [ fig : hwp_photo ] shows a drawing of the abs hwp system and the system in its installed configuration .",

    "\\label{equ : modulation_equation2}\\ ] ]    in practice , signals synchronous with the hwp rotation come from a number of sources other than sky polarization .",
    "because the hwp is warm , the dominant hwp - synchronous signal comes from polarized emission due to differential emissivity of the sapphire along different crystal axes , where the difference is roughly 0.3%.@xcite differential transmission produces linear polarization from unpolarized sky emission and is the second most significant hwp - synchronous signal for abs .",
    "reflections of radiation from the receiver off the hwp and back to the detectors will be polarized in reflection .",
    "these effects produce a linear polarization fixed relative to the hwp optical axis that couples to the detectors at @xmath26 .",
    "this signal can be modulated up to the @xmath27 signal band by small misalignments of the hwp axis from the air - bearing or encoder axes , as well as non - uniformities in the ar coating . at non - normal incidence , reflection can also produce a small polarization that can be modulated at @xmath27 .",

    "( [ equ : modulation_equation ] ) and ( [ equ : modulation_equation2 ] ) .",
    "any leakage of unpolarized power into the @xmath27 signal band is particularly detrimental because the unpolarized atmospheric signal and temperature anisotropies of the cmb are many orders of magnitude stronger than the signal of interest .",
    "such @xmath29 leakage arises at non - normal incidence , as a small linear polarization is generated upon each reflection in the sapphire and its ar coating , which is then rotated by the sapphire .",
    "given the 22@xmath3 field of view of abs , @xmath29 leakage from off - axis incidence must be evaluated .",
    "a @xmath30 transfer - matrix model that relates total electric and magnetic fields at the material boundaries was developed @xcite to estimate possible @xmath29 leakage from the hwp .",

    "variation of the function @xmath28 over long time scales occurs due to fluctuations in unpolarized atmospheric emission as well as the time variation of @xmath42 caused by temperature drifts of the hwp or changes in detector responsivity .",

    "however , since for abs @xmath13 varies slightly as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hwp_encoder_fft ] , the bandpass filter effectively suppresses contamination that is localized in the frequency domain of @xmath41 ( e.g. , electric or magnetic pickup at certain frequency or the atmospheric @xmath1 noise ) . without the bandpass filter , the variation of @xmath13 smears this contamination in the frequency space of @xmath53 .    in eq .",

    "time variations of @xmath67 and @xmath68 lead to long time - scale fluctuation , or @xmath1 noise , in the measurement .",

    "the sensitivity to the polarized component is the same as to the total intensity .",
    "we note that at no point in the analysis do we take the difference between the pair of orthogonally oriented detectors .",
    "we now investigate the quality of the demodulated timestreams during select calibration runs and normal cmb observations .",

    "@xcite the wiregrid is comprised of thin , reflective wires placed at intervals of one inch . during a calibration session , we placed the wiregrid on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight , and rotated it discretely around the line of sight to vary the polarization angle of the radiation reflected by the grid .",

    "the azimuth scans typically have a frequency of @xmath69 and are repeated for 11.5hours ; a set of repeated azimuth scans is denoted a `` constant - elevation scan '' ( ces ) .",
    "the detectors are rebiased at the beginning of every ces . in evaluating the data",
    ", we apply crude data selection criteria to reject ill - behaved teses ( e.g. , those that are not properly biased , those with too many glitches , etc . ) .",
    "we also reject teses that have significantly low optical efficiency ( @xmath70 of a typical tes or lower ) since inclusion of those may overestimate the stability of the timestreams .",

    "the abs polarimeters are white - noise dominated above a few mhz .",
    "the average among teses is calculated by inverse - variance weighting the power spectrum of each tes in each frequency bin so that it reflects the effective noise level relevant in the science analysis .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_example ] shows the power spectra before the demodulation .",
    "we show both the raw timestream spectrum and the spectrum after the subtraction of the @xmath28 component that is constant over the ces .",
    "although large spikes are observed at the harmonics of the modulation frequency @xmath13 , most of them correspond to the time - invariant @xmath28 and disappear after the subtraction .",
    "note that the subtraction leads to little loss of the cmb signal .",
    "@xcite the bottom panel shows the power spectra of the demodulated timestreams . here , there are two power spectra that correspond to two different methods of obtaining the power spectrum of a single tes .",
    "one is to simply fourier transform each of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath58 , and add them in power , which we will simply refer to as `` the spectrum of @xmath58 . '' in the other method , we first redefine the demodulated timestream as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is found by maximizing ( minimizing ) the low - frequency noise of the real ( imaginary ) part of @xmath77 , and then averaging the power spectra of the real and imaginary parts by inverse - variance weighting in each frequency bin in the same manner as we do in averaging different teses .",
    "note that the demodulated timestream from a single tes has two degrees of freedom ( the real and imaginary parts ) and these two correspond to two orthogonal linear combinations of @xmath62 and @xmath63 polarizations .",
    "thus , @xmath77 simply redefines the orthogonal linear combinations such that they are the eigenmodes of the @xmath1 noise for a single tes .",
    "the phase @xmath76 is determined separately in each ces for each tes .",
    "we typically find only one dominant mode of @xmath1 noise in the two degrees of freedom of a demodulated timestream , and the imaginary part of @xmath77 tends to exhibit extremely low @xmath1 noise .",
    "thus , the second method of inverse - variance weighting @xmath77 evaluates the effective noise level better than the first method .",
    "the phase @xmath76 for each tes tends to show large ces - by - ces scatter .",
    "however , it tends to show a mild peak at a certain value and the peak is correlated to the polarization angle to which the tes is sensitive .",
    "thus , at least part of the source of the @xmath1 noise has optical origin such as @xmath29 leakage .    as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_example ] , the low - frequency noise component in raw timestreams typically has @xmath78 and a spectral index @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80mhz knee frequencies in the demodulated timestreams correspond to @xmath81 reduction in noise power ( or @xmath82 reduction in amplitude ) and demonstrate a leakage from total power to polarization of less than @xmath31db .",
    "figure  [ fig : fknee_distr ] shows the distribution of the knee frequencies of the demodulated timestreams for @xmath83 detectors .",
    "the knee frequencies , characterizing the levels of low - frequency noise excess , are determined by fitting the following model to the power spectrum : @xmath84,\\ ] ] where free parameters of the fit are the high - frequency noise power @xmath85 , the spectral index @xmath7 , and the knee frequency @xmath86 . in the fit , the region around the scan frequency @xmath87 is excluded .",
    "three knee frequencies are determined for each detector by fitting the spectrum of @xmath58 as well as the spectrum for each of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath77 .",
    "we evaluate the primary science data of about one month period .",
    "for each detector , the median knee frequency over this period is calculated for each of the three spectra .",
    "shown are the distributions of these median knee frequencies per detector .",
    "the medians among all the detectors are 2.0mhz , 2.6mhz and 0.8mhz for the spectra of @xmath58 , the real part of @xmath77 , and the imaginary part of @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath88 is so low that its timescale is close to the length of the timestream itself , small biases are introduced in the estimates above .",
    "these biases are evaluated through monte - carlo simulation studies and all of the results presented above are corrected for the bias .",
    "the corrections are small , corresponding to @xmath89@xmath90mhz in the estimation of @xmath88 .",
