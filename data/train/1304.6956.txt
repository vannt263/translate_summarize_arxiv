    "a space @xmath4 is said to be a _ codimension one manifold factor _ provided that @xmath5 is a manifold .",
    "it is a long standing unsolved problem as to whether all resolvable generalized manifolds are codimension one manifold factors @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called product with a line problem and it is the essence of the famous generalized r.  l.  moore problem @xcite .",
    "the product with a line problem speaks directly to one of the most fundamental questions in geometric topology , which is how to recognize manifolds @xcite . because manifolds have a rich structure which is useful to exploit in many areas of mathematics and its applications , it is important to recognize when one is dealing with a space that is a manifold .",
    "one notable example is the relevance of the product with a line problem to the famous busemann conjecture in metric geometry @xcite .",
    "one might wonder even if a decomposition of @xmath1 into convex sets could give rise to a decomposition space topologically distinct from @xmath1 .",
    "this problem was investigated for several years beginning with bing in the 1950 s @xcite . in 1970 ,",
    "armentrout @xcite produced the first example of a decomposition of @xmath6 into convex sets that yields a non - manifold .",
    "then in 1975 , eaton @xcite demonstrated that a certain decomposition of @xmath6 into points and straight line segments , originally proposed by bing @xcite , is indeed topologically distinct from @xmath6 .",
    "hence , this type of complexity is significant .",
    "it should also be noted that there are no known examples of a non - manifold resulting from a decomposition of @xmath7 into convex sets .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate how the type of complexity represented by decompositions of @xmath1 into convex sets can affect the classification of a decomposition space as a codimension one manifold factor .",
    "we shall demonstrate that decompositions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , into convex sets are always codimension one manifold factors .",
    "in particular , we shall show that such spaces have a particularly strong general position property , the disjoint arc - disk property .",
    "we briefly review some basic definitions and notations . recall that a map @xmath8 is said to be _ proper _ if whenever @xmath9 is a compact subset of @xmath10 , then @xmath11 is compact .",
    "there are various equivalent definitions of upper semicontinuous decompositions @xcite , but the following will be the most useful for our purposes :    a decomposition @xmath0 of @xmath12 into compact sets is said to be _ upper semicontinuous _ ( usc ) if and only if the associated decomposition map @xmath13 is a proper map .    a compact subset @xmath9 of a space @xmath4",
    "is said to be _ cell - like _ if for each neighborhood @xmath14 of @xmath9 in @xmath4 , @xmath9 can be contracted to a point inside @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a usc decomposition @xmath0 of @xmath12 is said to be _ cell - like _ if each element @xmath15 is cell - like .",
    "a map @xmath16 is said to be _ cell - like _ if for each @xmath17 , @xmath18 is cell - like .",
    "resolvable generalized n - manifold _ is an @xmath19-dimensional space @xmath4 that is the image of a cell - like map @xmath20 where @xmath12 is an @xmath19-manifold .",
    "convex sets are contractible , and hence they are cell - like .",
    "thus , a usc decomposition @xmath0 of @xmath1 into convex sets is a cell - like decomposition and the associated decomposition map @xmath21 is a cell - like map .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 is finite - dimensional follows from a result of zemke ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5.2 ) ) .",
    "therefore , in this setting , @xmath3 is a resolvable generalized @xmath19-manifold .    for resolvable generalized manifolds",
    ", we have the following very useful approximate lifting theorem , which follows from ( * ? ? ?",

    "then for any map @xmath24 of a finite - dimensional compact polyhedron @xmath25 , and any @xmath26 , there exists a map @xmath27 such that @xmath28 is an @xmath29-approximation of @xmath30 .",
    "general position properties are very useful in detecting codimension one manifold factors @xcite . for our results",
    ", we shall only need to employ the following :    a space @xmath4 is said to have the _ disjoint arc - disk property _",
    "( dadp ) provided that any two maps @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be approximated by maps with disjoint images , where @xmath33 denotes the unit interval and @xmath34 denotes a disk .",

    "useful in discussions of the dadp is the local @xmath35-co - connectedness property .",

    "( @xmath35-lcc ) in @xmath4 if for every @xmath37 , each neighborhood @xmath14 of @xmath38 contains another neighborhood @xmath39 of @xmath38 so that any two points in @xmath40 are path connected in @xmath41 .",
    "note that if @xmath25 is nowhere dense in @xmath4 , then @xmath42 .",

    "the main result of this paper is the following theorem :    let @xmath0 be an upper semicontinuous decomposition of @xmath1 into convex sets , where @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath3 is a codimension one manifold factor .",
    "this theorem will follow immediately as a corollary of theorem [ dadp thm ] and the following theorem :    [ dadp-4 thm ] let @xmath0 be an upper semicontinuous decomposition of @xmath1 into convex sets , where @xmath2",
    ". then @xmath3 has the dadp .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it follows from corollary [ path ] that it suffices to show that there is an @xmath29-approximation @xmath50 of @xmath30 such that @xmath51 is @xmath52-dimensional .",
    "let @xmath53 be a piecewise linear map , that is an @xmath54-approximate lift of @xmath30 .",
    "we shall show that @xmath55 is then the desired map .",
    "let @xmath56 denote a triangulation of @xmath57 .",
    "we claim that if @xmath58 is a @xmath52-simplex of @xmath56 , then @xmath59 is @xmath52-dimensional . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath60 be the decomposition induced over @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath60 is the decomposition of @xmath1 having as the only nontrivial elements , the nontrivial elements of @xmath0 that meet @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the associated decomposition map .",
    "note that @xmath63 is necessarily a proper map , being a decomposition induced over a closed set in the decomposition space of a usc decomposition .",
    "let @xmath64 be the @xmath52-dimensional plane in @xmath65 that contains @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the restriction of @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath66 is also a proper map .",
    "thus @xmath66 determines a usc decomposition of the plane into convex sets , elements that do not separate the plane .",
    "it now follows from a classical result of moore @xcite , that @xmath66 is a near - homeomorphism onto its image .",
    "thus @xmath67 is at most @xmath52-dimensional .",
    "but @xmath67 is homeomorphic to @xmath68 , which in turn is homeomorphic to @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath61 is at most @xmath52-dimensional subset of @xmath3 .",
    "hence @xmath69 is a @xmath52-dimensional subset of the generalized @xmath19-manifold @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , the complexity represented by decompositions into convex sets does not inhibit a decomposition space from being a codimension one manifold factor .",
    "the fact that such spaces satisfy the dadp is a pleasant result .",
    "it is well known that not all codimension one manifold factors satisfy the dadp , and hence the dadp is not a general position property that provides a characterization of codimension one manifold factors .",
    "in fact , the dadp condition is a relatively weak tool for detecting codimension one manifold factors , compared to other general position properties such as :    * the disjoint homotopies property @xcite ; * the plentiful @xmath52-manifolds property @xcite ; * the @xmath35-stitched disks property @xcite ; * the method of @xmath70-fractured maps @xcite ; and * the disjoint topographies ( or disjoint concordance ) property @xcite .",
