    "strong decay processes still present a considerable challenge within the physics of hadrons .",
    "this is unfortunate , not only in view of the vast amount of experimental data but also because the decay properties of hadron resonances give important insights into strong interaction physics ( see , for example , the recent nstar workshops  @xcite ) .",
    "investigations of strong decay processes date back to the late 1960s  , and with the refinement of constituent quark models ( cqms ) various aspects of the strong decays have been studied  . in particular , the decay mechanism and the type of hyperfine interactions in cqms have been in the focus of interest .",
    "these investigations have been performed within nonrelativistic or so - called relativised models , and usually a number of parameters has been introduced beyond the cqms employed .",
    "further complications resulted in the ambiguity of the proper phase space factor and various forms have been used .",
    "as a consequence the available results are strongly dependent on the chosen inputs .",
    "this makes them hardly comparable to each other , and from the comparison with experiment the quality of the cqms can not be judged reliably .",
    "in our investigations we are primarily interested in the direct predictions of decay widths by different types of cqms .",
    "once they are established on a consistent basis for all decay modes , one can go ahead to study particular details of the decay mechanism as well as baryon wave functions .",
    "recently , we presented a covariant calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays of @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances with relativistic cqms of the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) and goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) types  @xcite .",
    "the investigations were performed in the framework of poincar - invariant quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we adhered to its point - form version  @xcite and applied a spectator - model decay operator . in this way",
    "the transition amplitude could be calculated in a manifestly covariant manner and ambiguities regarding the phase - space factor could be avoided .    here",
    "we report on the extension of our study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays to strange baryon resonances .",
    "again we work with the relativistic gbe and oge cqms of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .    while there is a wealth of experimental data on these types of decays , theoretical investigations are rather scarce in the literature , at least within modern cqms ; in particular , we are not aware of any relativistic calculations .",
    "there exists an older study of strange resonance decays  @xcite but the corresponding results are mainly of a qualitative nature .",
    "more recently , since the advent of cqms , there have only been a few investigations of strong decays in the strange sector  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : theory ] we briefly describe the theoretical framework of the relativistic calculations with the pfsm decay operator ; the nonrelativistic limit is delegated to the appendix  [ sec : appendix ] . in sections  [ sec : num1 ] and  [ sec : num2 ] we present the numerical results for decay widths in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-channels , respectively .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our findings and give a conclusion .",
    "the decay width of a hadron resonance is defined by the expression @xmath4 given by the matrix element of the four - momentum conserving reduced decay operator @xmath5 between incoming and outgoing hadron states @xmath6 denotes the four - momentum of the outgoing meson in the rest - frame of the decaying baryon resonance .",
    "the latter is expressed by the eigenstate @xmath7 , characterized by the eigenvalues of the velocity @xmath8 , mass @xmath9 , intrinsic spin @xmath10 with z - component @xmath11 , and isospin @xmath12 with z - projection @xmath13 ; correspondingly the outgoing baryon state is denoted by primed eigenvalues .",
    "the baryon eigenstates are obtained by the solution of the eigenvalue problem of the invariant mass operator @xmath14 including the interactions .",
    "they are simultaneously eigenstates of the baryon four - velocity @xmath15 .    representing the baryon eigenstates with suitable basis states the matrix element in eq .",

    "these wave functions result from the velocity - state representations of the baryon eigenstates ( for more details of the formalism see ref .",
    "the wigner rotations stem from the boosts of the baryon eigenstates relating the individual quark momenta through @xmath22 .",
    "the momentum representation of the decay operator follows from the pfsm construction , which assumes that only one of the quarks directly couples to the emitted meson , while the other two act as spectators : @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the quark - meson coupling constant , @xmath25 the mass of the active quark , @xmath26 the flavor - transition operator specifying the particular decay mode , and @xmath27 the quark spinor according to the standard notation  @xcite ; details of the formalism can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath28 is specific for the pfsm construction  @xcite and is taken to be @xmath29 this form is congruent with the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite and also consistent with the requirements of baryon charge normalisation as well as time - reversal invariance of the electromagnetic form - factors  @xcite .",
    "the same normalisation factor was also used in previous studies of the electroweak structure of the nucleons and the other light and strange baryon ground states  @xcite .",
    "we also consider a nonrelativistic reduction of the pfsm decay operator .",
    "its derivation is given in the appendix  [ sec : appendix ] and it leads to the standard impulse approximation according to the elementary emission model ( eem ) : @xmath30",
    "for the calculations of the mesonic decay widths we employ two different kinds of relativistic cqms . thereby we can learn about the importance of distinct hyperfine interactions .",
    "in particular , we consider the gbe cqm  @xcite and the oge cqm in the variant of the relativistic version of the bhaduri - cohler - nogami model  @xcite as parameterised by theussl et al .",
    "the invariant mass spectra of both cqms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lasig ] in comparison to experiment as compiled by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite .",
    "the spectra of the two cqms show the typical behavior as it is well known from the literature  @xcite .",
    "only the flavor - dependent hyperfine interaction of the gbe cqm is able to reproduce at the same time the correct level orderings in the nucleon and the @xmath31 excitation spectra  @xcite .",
    "both types of cqms fail in reproducing the @xmath31(1405 ) resonance .",
    "further shortcomings of the cqms may also reside in other strange baryon excitations , for which no experimental data exist at the moment .",
    "differences between theoretical and experimental resonance masses , however , can have a strong influence on the predictions for decay widths . in order to have these mass effects under control",
    ", we calculated the decay widths by using also experimental masses as input . in this way we can directly estimate the effects from different quark - model wave functions too",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the nonrelativistic reduction again has a considerable effect on the @xmath1 decay widths . as observed in case of the @xmath32 decays , it enhances in particular the results for the @xmath33 states .",
    "the corresponding figures appear way too big at least for the @xmath31(1670 ) and @xmath31(1800 ) resonances . on the other hand , the decay widths of the @xmath34",
    "are again reduced and practically vanish .",
    "we have reported relativistic calculations of nonstrange decays of strange baryon resonances within cqms . in particular , we have presented covariant predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays of @xmath31 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 resonances by two types of cqms , the ones with gbe and oge dynamics .",
    "the transition elements have been calculated with a spectator - model decay operator in point - form relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the present results complement the ones obtained earlier for the same mesonic decay modes of the ( nonstrange ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances  @xcite .    regarding the @xmath0 decay widths we have found that the direct relativistic predictions of the cqms in general underestimate the experimental data .",
    "in this respect the results parallel the ones obtained earlier for @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances along the same approach . here , only the @xmath31(1670 ) represents an exception .",
    "we argue that a possible mixing effect with the @xmath31(1405 ) resonance is responsible for this result .",
    "such mixings of resonance states should certainly be taken into account in a future more refined calculation .",
    "the systematics of the relativistic results has also led to a new interpretation of the three lowest @xmath33 @xmath35 excitations produced by the cqms . in principle , all three can be seen as candidates for the phenomenological @xmath35(1750 ) .",
    "however , most naturally only the third state @xmath37 is identified with the experimentally measured @xmath35(1750 ) , as it produces the most adequate @xmath0 decay width .",
    "for the @xmath1 decay widths we have found a qualitatively similar behavior , namely , they are all rather small or at most reach the ( scarce ) experimental data from below .",
    "even the largest @xmath1 decay width of @xmath38 can be characterized in this manner , since its total decay width is reported to be extremely large .    in the present work we have also shown that the pfsm decay operator has a sensible nonrelativistic reduction , leading to the standard elementary - emission model .",
    "however , it has also become evident that the nonrelativistic decay widths exhibit no consistent pattern , as they vary considerably in their magnitudes , scattering above and below the experimental data .",
    "the nonrelativistic reduction introduces sizable effects strongly depending on the @xmath39 values of the pertinent resonances .",
    "we have herewith completed the relativistic studies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays of light and strange baryon resonances within cqms .",
    "we have established the direct predictions of two types of cqms without introducing any additional parameterisations .",
    "the results show a consistent behavior but they are not able to explain the experimental data . in any case",
    "relativistic effects are found to be of utmost importance .",
    "the present study provides for a reliable starting point to improve the relativistic description of mesonic decays .",

    "( [ eq : transel ] ) @xmath40 . in a first step",
    "we replace in this matrix element the lorentz boosts by galilean boosts and use free three - quark states @xmath41 instead of velocity states for the representation of the eigenstates of the quark - model hamiltonian .",
    "this leads to baryon wave functions in the form @xmath42 @xmath43 where the completeness relation of the free three - quark states reads @xmath44 using the latter one obtains for the spectator - model decay operator of eq .",

    "the nonrelativistic baryon momenta satisfy @xmath50 as well as @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , the energy and the momentum of the emitted meson are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "next we have to express the various variables in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) in terms of the residual integration variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "furthermore , one neglected terms of the orders @xmath60 and @xmath61 , upon the assumption that the quark masses @xmath62 are large as compared to the absolute value of the three - momentum @xmath63 and the meson energy @xmath64",
    ".    for the practical calculation one transforms to a coordinate system , where the momentum transfer to the final baryon is into the negative z - direction and obtains for the relations of the primed and unprimed variables ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) and ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) @xmath69 for @xmath70 . here",

    "the latter is specific for the pseudovector coupling in the decay operator  ( [ momrepresent ] ) ; it would not be present at the same order of nonrelativistic approximation in case of pseudoscalar coupling ."
