    "when the face centered cubic ( f.c.c ) phase of @xmath3(a = k , rb , cs ) compounds is slowly cooled from 400k , one - dimensional polymerization of c@xmath4 molecules spontaneously occurs along the ( 110 ) cubic direction and leads to an orthorhombic phase@xcite .",
    "a drastic change in the electronic properties is observed at the structural transition@xcite .",
    "indeed , the f.c.c .",
    "phase was shown to be a mott insulator@xcite , whereas in the orthorhombic phase a plasma frequency was measured in optical experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the density of carriers is likely to be rather low or their effective mass very large since the plasma frequency is equal to 0.1ev in @xmath5 polymer and even lower for @xmath6 and @xmath7@xcite .",
    "in addition , the low frequency conductivity of both @xmath6 and @xmath8 decreases smoothly over a broad temperature range , being at variance with @xmath9 which remains conducting down to 4.2k@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependence of the @xmath10 spin - lattice relaxation rate shows that strong magnetic fluctuations are present up to room temperature in @xmath11 and @xmath8@xcite and the sharp decrease of the uniform static susceptibility ( measured from epr line intensity ) below 50k for @xmath6 and 40k for @xmath7@xcite , suggests that both compounds undergo magnetic transitions at these respective temperatures .",
    "the occurrence of spin ordering is also evident from nmr experiments@xcite : the slowing down of magnetic fluctuations gives rise to a divergent relaxation rate below 40k .",
    "however , the nature of the spin order is less obvious . on one hand ,",
    "epr experiments @xcite suggest the onset of a spin density wave ground state as a result of a possible one - dimensional ( 1d ) character of the band structure . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath12 studies@xcite show a gradual transition towards a highly disordered magnetic phase and do not rule out the possibility of a random spin freezing below 40k .",
    "in a recent nmr work@xcite , we have shown that some of the @xmath13 sites remain unaffected by the onset of the spin - ordering in the low temperature state , magnetic and nonmagnetic domains being spatially distributed . at the temperature of 13.8k the occurrence of a charge redistribution and a concomitant decrease of the local electronic susceptibility inside these nonmagnetic domains have been observed @xcite . in agreement with this latter result ,",
    "detailed analysis of the epr linewidth at ambient pressure also suggest that two distinct magnetic environments coexist in the low temperature state of @xmath6 and @xmath7 polymers @xcite and insofar as a charge redistribution occurs in the nonmagnetic domains at 13.8k@xcite , the spontaneous thermal contraction recently observed at 14k by x - ray diffraction in @xmath7@xcite strongly supports the fact that these inhomogeneities are intrinsic.in this manuscript , we give experimental evidence showing that the `` conducting '' state of the @xmath8 polymerized phase can not be understood within the framework of an electronic band conductor as claimed earlier@xcite .",
    "we first report the temperature dependence of the spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath14 for both @xmath10 and @xmath13 nuclei at different pressures up to 9 kbar , indicating that in the temperature domain above 80k two different mechanisms govern the relaxation of @xmath10 and @xmath15 nuclei respectively .",
    "as far as @xmath13 is concerned , @xmath16 decreases linearly down to about 80k though remaining pressure independent up to 9kbar .",
    "this behavior is in sharp contrast with the @xmath10 nuclei for which @xmath17 strongly decreases under pressure up to 9kbar while remaining almost temperature independent .",
    "the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath10 nuclei exists _ independently _ of the nature of the ground state of the system .",
    "more insight into these peculiar properties is then obtained using quadrupolar echo experiments performed on the @xmath18 nucleus which enable us to analyze with great accuracy the temperature dependence of the nmr spectrum at 1bar .",
    "we show that the nmr spectrum of the two phases ( magnetic and nonmagnetic ) is motional narrowed above 100k because of the fast motion of the local environment around the @xmath18 sites .",
    "the evolution of the lineshape with temperature reveals that the static coexistence of two different @xmath13 sites below 15k arises from a gradual freezing of these fluctuations in the local environment .",
    "the measurements have been conducted on two powdered samples with entirely consistent results , one of them ( 10% ) @xmath19 enriched . the pressure set up is a homemade double - stage copper - beryllium cell using fluor - inert as the pressure medium .",
    "this enables us to correct for each temperature the loss of pressure within the sample chamber due to the gradual freezing of the fluor-inert.the spin - lattice relaxation were measured by monitoring the recovery of the magnetization after saturation with a series of @xmath20 pulses .",
    "the recovery curve is exponential for @xmath13 and @xmath10 @xcite at room temperature . at ambient pressure ,",
    "the recovery curve gradually becomes bi - exponential for both nuclei below 40k . a large distribution of short relaxation rates",
    "is observed giving raise to a recovery curve of the following shape @xmath21 with a value of @xmath22 of the order of 0.5 at the lowest temperature investigated i.e 4k . at 5kbar",
    "the recovery curve is for @xmath13 exponential down to 4k .",
    "not so for @xmath10 since a nonexponential recovery is observed below 20k .",
    "different fit procedures did not help us to determine without ambiguity the shape of the recovery but no significant change were observed on the qualitative temperature dependence of @xmath17 .",
    "the relaxation rates @xmath17 shown on fig.1b at 5kbar are therefore deduced below 20k from a fit of the recovery curve assuming it to be exponential as above 20k . at 9kbar ,",
    "the recovery curve is exponential for @xmath13 and @xmath10 in the all temperature range investigated .",
    "finally we should point out that despite the presence of a static quadrupole splitting@xcite for the nmr line of @xmath13 in the orthorhombic phase , the smallness of the quadrupole frequency which is of the order of 5khz enables us to saturate all the transitions at once .",
    "therefore the nuclear levels are initially equally populated establishing a well - defined spin temperature ( equal to infinite ) . in that case",
    "no deviation from an exponential behavior is expected for the relaxation of the magnetization@xcite which perfect exponential recovery at room temperature is a proof of the homogeneity of the samples .",
    "we report on fig.1a and fig.1b the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate for @xmath13 and @xmath10 nuclei at ambient pressure , 5kbar and 9kbar .",
    "the large enhancement of @xmath16 and @xmath17 below 40k is due to a slowing down of magnetic fluctuations which is completely suppressed at 5kbar . at this pressure ,",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath25 decrease exponentially below 20k revealing the opening of a spin - gap at @xmath26 , the ground state being homogeneous and nonmagnetic .",
    "the effect of an applied pressure on this long range order has been carefully investigated by @xmath13-nmr .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath27 at 5 , 5.5 , 5.7 and 9kbar is shown in fig.2.the well - defined instability at 5kbar gives rise to a sharp peak on @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "quite remarkably , a slight increase of the applied pressure strongly reduces the amplitude of the spin - gap , without any significant change in @xmath28 itself ( as given by the position of the @xmath27 peak , see on fig.2 ) .",
    "however , a smooth decrease of the temperature @xmath29 at which the slowing down of magnetic fluctuations occurs has been observed by epr experiments under pressure up to 4kbar@xcite .",
    "this fact is also evident from the temperature dependence of the linewidth of the @xmath13 nmr line shown at different pressures on fig.3 .",
    "thus , as the pressure increases @xmath29 drops continuously along a transition line which does not exist for the case of the spin - singlet ground state .",
    "henceforth we can infer that the sharp suppression of the spin - gap below 20k which in turn gives rise to a metallic state , is not due to continuous changes in the magnitude of the electronic interactions but may reflect some structural changes above 5kbar as suggested by dc conductivity measurements performed under pressure@xcite .",
    "another striking feature in the response of the polymerized phase @xmath30 to high pressure appears at glance in fig.1a and fig.1b .",
    "indeed , a clear distinction has to be made between the two temperature domains 4.2 - 80k and 80k-300k .",
    "below 80k , @xmath16 and @xmath25 exhibit a similar pressure and temperature dependence .",
    "this is , however , no longer true above 80k , where @xmath16 and @xmath25 behave in complete different ways . in particular",
    ", we can see in fig.1a that above 80k , @xmath16 shows no pressure dependence up to 9kbar unlike @xmath17 , which is shown on fig.1b . within the first five kilobars ,",
    "the relaxation of @xmath10 nuclei is strongly affected by pressure in two manners:(i ) an overall depression is observed under pressure following the depression of the uniform spin susceptibility ( @xmath31 ) measured by epr @xcite which drops at a rate of about 10% per kbar , ( ii ) a weakly temperature dependent contribution to @xmath17 ( 20% decrease from 300 to 40k ) is suppressed at 5 kbar.broadly speaking , the spin - lattice relaxation rate for a given nuclei and the static electronic spin susceptibility are linked together by the following relation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the form factor of the hyperfine interaction between a given nuclei and the electronic spins located at the neighboring sites . unlike @xmath13 which environment is octahedral , there is no particular symmetry for @xmath10 sites . if both nuclei are coupled to the same electronic spins then , that @xmath17 and @xmath16 display a different pressure and temperature dependence above 80k , might be attributed to the presence of a spatially dependent electronic spin susceptibility which dominates the relaxation of @xmath34 nuclei",
    "however , as previously shown for @xmath11 @xcite , the decrease of @xmath17 follows the decrease of the uniform spin susceptibility deduced from epr@xcite within at least the first five kilobars .",
    "this reveals that in the low pressure regime , the dominant contribution to the relaxation of @xmath23 above 80k is due to enhanced magnetic fluctuations at the wave vector @xmath35 and therefore , the differences described above between @xmath23 and @xmath24 can not be ascribed to the form factor of the alkali site in the polymerized phase .",
    "as it is , one can draw the following conclusions .",
    "first , the absence of pressure dependence observed for @xmath16 above 80k shows that the dominant contribution to the fluctuating field at @xmath36 site in this temperature range is unrelated to the electronic spins involved in the relaxation of @xmath10 nuclei .",
    "secondly , the fact that above 80k , @xmath17 is weakly temperature dependent at ambient pressure and constant at 5kbar suggests that the electronic spins are localized .",
    "this latter conclusion is in agreement with the calculated band structure of the polymer @xmath37@xcite which displays a dispersionless 1d half - filled band at the fermi level but in apparent contradiction with transport measurements@xcite performed in the similar compound @xmath38 .",
    "one can therefore conclude that a model based on a single electron specie is inadequate for describing the electronic properties of the polymerized phases @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "in a previous work@xcite , we have shown that the use of quadrupolar spin echoes of @xmath13 nuclei enables to reveal the presence of nonmagnetic domains within a magnetic background . however , whether this inhomogeneous state results from the existence of static structural defects along the chains or is purely electronically driven e.g. as proposed for underdoped cuprates@xcite and spin - ladders compounds@xcite , remained an open question . in what follows",
    ", we address this problem again with the aid of quadrupolar spin echoes in order to determine how the inhomogeneous state at low temperature arises from the high temperature one .",
    "in a similar way than in the reference@xcite , the spin echoes of @xmath13 have been obtained after a ( @xmath39 ) in - phase rf pulse sequence@xcite , maintaining fixed the echo delay @xmath40 at 40@xmath41 .",
    "half of the spin - echo at 3@xmath40 is then fourier transformed .",
    "this procedure gives rise to a spectrum containing two lines @xmath42 and @xmath43 split by an amount @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the quadrupole frequency of @xmath18 nuclei in the polymerized phase @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath13 spectrum is displayed on fig.4 at different temperatures between 100 and 4.2k .",
    "the expected doublet spectrum corresponding to a single @xmath13 site is observed at 100k , but as @xmath46 approaches 40k , the shape becomes asymmetric and a fine structure gradually develops . at 25k ,",
    "the coexistence of two different @xmath18 sites is evident in fig.4 , with a frequency difference in the local field of the order of @xmath44 .",
    "this means therefore that two distinct magnetic environments are spatially distributed at this temperature .",
    "as the temperature is further lowered , the situation with a single quadrupolar split is recovered and thus only one @xmath13 site contributes to the spin echo signal below 15k .",
    "the amplitude of the spin echo refocused at 3@xmath40 is proportional to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the width of the local field distribution due to the static electronic moments at a given temperature  @xmath46 .",
    "considering two distinct populations of @xmath13 nuclei below 30k , @xmath49 and @xmath50 which are coupled to the local field inhomogeneity @xmath51 and located inside the nonmagnetic domains respectively , the total number of @xmath18 sites contributing to the spin echo signal at 3@xmath40 can be expressed as :  @xmath52 .",
    "if the condition @xmath53 is fulfilled , only a fraction @xmath54 of the nuclei contribute to a spin echo at @xmath55 since this experiment selects those @xmath56 sites which are entirely decoupled from the onset of local magnetism .",
    "let @xmath57 be the integrated intensity of the fourier transform performed on this spin echo .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath58 ( equal to @xmath59 ) is reported on fig.5 .",
    "we observe that a majority of the @xmath18 nuclei is gradually wiped out of the signal below 40k .",
    "a minimal value for @xmath54 is reached at 15k and amounts to about 10% of the total number of nuclei at @xmath60 .",
    "however , the estimated ratio between the two phases from the @xmath23 spectrum suggests that approximately half of the @xmath23 sites do not see the magnetic moment distribution in the low temperature state@xcite .",
    "we may solve this puzzle by considering that the @xmath23 spins probe the very local properties within each @xmath61 chains carrying the electronic spins whereas only @xmath62 sites far from any magnetic domain will contribute to the echo signal refocused at @xmath55 .",
    "this would mean that the boundary surface is large compare to the domains size suggesting that the phase separation sets on a microscopic scale.to gain insight into the driving force of this process more attention must be paid to what happens above the spin ordering temperature .",
    "in particular , we see on fig.4 that the splitting of the @xmath13 spectrum displays a fine structure near 40k although the nmr spectrum corresponding to two @xmath13 sites is not yet resolved .",
    "this can be understood if we assume that the local field of a @xmath13 nucleus jumps randomly from one value to the other in the `` conducting '' state .",
    "indeed , using only the difference between the resonance frequencies @xmath63 and the hopping time @xmath64 , we can propose the following scenario . at high temperature ,",
    "@xmath65 and the spectrum is motional narrowed , which means that only one doublet is visible .",
    "when the temperature is lowered , the jump frequency ( @xmath66 ) decreases and the condition @xmath67 becomes fulfilled with a fine structure developing in the nmr spectrum . finally , when @xmath68 , the quadrupolar splitting of the two sites are well resolved , _ i.e_. one for @xmath13 sites in the magnetic domains and the other for @xmath18 sites in the nonmagnetic ones .",
    "we simulate each of the three cases and our simulations at fixed @xmath63 are shown in fig.6 for different correlation times @xmath64 and superimposed ( dotted line ) on the experimental spectra on fig.4 . clearly , the calculated spectra bear a strong resemblance with the experimental ones displayed on fig.3 between 100 and 30k . we can thus infer the existence of a thermally activated change in the local environment of @xmath13 sites which may become the dominant contribution to @xmath16 when the frequency @xmath69 is of the order of the larmor frequency ( 43 mhz ) of the @xmath70 nuclei .",
    "therefore , from the results exposed in this section we can conclude to the existence of another degree of freedom aside from the fluctuations of the electronic spins located on the @xmath71 molecules , and possibly related to spontaneous local structural changes in the polymerized phase .",
    "as emphasized above , one of the difficulty aroused by our work is to bring together the conducting nature of the polymerized phase established by optical and transport measurements@xcite with the pressure and temperature dependence of @xmath17 which strongly suggest that electrons are localized .",
    "it therefore turns out natural to question ourselves about the possible relationship between the local structural change around @xmath13 nuclei and the presence of charge degrees of freedom like polarons in the polymerized phase . on the basis of the above nmr results and anticipating results described further on , we suppose that the mobility of a charge carrier in the polymerized phase mainly depends upon the occurrence of a local structural distortion in its vicinity . from a point of view which is somewhat naive",
    ", one may consider that at thermal equilibrium , the charge carriers diffuse through the lattice under the action of a random force @xmath72 which takes on only two discrete values @xmath73 .",
    "for our particular purpose , the relevant physical quantity to be consider is the spectral density @xmath74 defined as the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath75 , the brackets indicating an ensemble average . in our case , @xmath76 can be assumed to be of the form@xcite : @xmath77 , which leads to the following spectral density : @xmath78 . because any excited state of the charge carriers is to relax due to the random force @xmath72 , the spectral density @xmath74 will lead to a strong frequency dependence in the response function of the carriers to external oscillating fields .",
    "it is therefore of a great interest to focus on ac resistivity measurements@xcite performed at ambient pressure in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for @xmath5 which does not exhibit a slowing down of spin fluctuations , ac and dc resistivities display a similar temperature dependence",
    "this is however not true for @xmath6 since a frequency dependent peak is clearly observed on ac resistivity .",
    "the peak shifts from 35k at 1.1khz down to 25k at 43hz , the order of magnitude of these frequencies being in good agreement with the value we deduced from our simulate spectra in the same temperature range for @xmath8 ( c.f.fig.6 ) .",
    "the fact that the electronic properties of @xmath6 and @xmath7 display similar electronic and structural features as opposed to @xmath5 allows us to extrapolate the results obtained by zhou _",
    "et al _ for @xmath6 to the case of @xmath8 .",
    "thus experiments show that in the two polymerized phases @xmath6 and @xmath8 , the dissipation reaches a maximum when the hopping frequency of the local environment of the alkali ion becomes equal to the ac frequency",
    ". such a coincidence can be hardly fortuitous and suggests that the mobility of the charge carriers in the polymerized phase is strongly coupled to the environment of the alkali ion . in this context , it is worthwhile to mention that polaron - like distortions such as @xmath79 have been predicted to be energetically favorable in the charged polymer @xmath80 which exhibits a tendency to undergo a charge density wave transition @xcite . in that particular case , the conduction mechanism would be due to an intramolecular property of the polymer itself and that would drastically change our expectations regarding the pressure effect on the electronic properties of the polymerized phase . however , on the sole basis of the nmr experiment above described we can not address the microscopic mechanism at the origin of the spontaneous formation of polarons in the polymerized phase . in the light of the above considerations , it is interesting to shortly reconsider the pressure effect on the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath17 of @xmath34 nuclei in the low pressure regime .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath17 shows at room temperature a similar pressure decrease than the electronic spin susceptibility deduced from epr @xcite which suggests that magnetic fluctuations at the wave vector @xmath35 dominate @xmath17 at ambient pressure .",
    "one possible explanation for the origin of these enhanced uniform fluctuations might be that polarons acting as local defects , induce disorder in the af exchange coupling @xmath81 along the chain leading to the formation of spin clusters@xcite .",
    "it was indeed shown theoretically@xcite that the low energy magnetic fluctuations ( i.e when @xmath82 ) of a disordered af spins chain are merely governed by clusters with an odd number of spins , each one acting as a nearly free localized ( 1/2 ) spin .",
    "in such a case the _",
    "reversible _ suppression at 5kbar of a weak temperature dependent term in @xmath17 could be ascribed to the suppression with applied pressure of disorder in the magnetic coupling along the chain which presence would be henceforth closely related to the slowing down of spin fluctuations in the low temperature state .",
    "much more experimental inputs are however required to go beyond this statement .",
    "as it is , the phase separation occurring in the low temperature state at ambient pressure appears to be the logical outcome of the twofold nature of the polymerized phase @xmath8 that is : mobile polarons spontaneously form aside from localized electrons and compete with a 3d magnetic order imposed by the transverse dipolar coupling between the chains .",
    "note that the presence of nonmagnetic domains is in itself a strong hint that polarons are not randomly spatially distributed within the magnetic background but may form collective structures developing a long range order below 14k as suggested by nmr@xcite and x - ray experiments@xcite .",
    "the work described in this manuscript deals with the electronic properties of the polymerized phase @xmath8 extensively studied by nmr of @xmath10 and @xmath13 nuclei .",
    "the salient result is that the electronic properties of the polymerized phase @xmath8 involve two degrees of freedom : one related to localized spins , the other related to mobile charges which mobility is strongly entangled to the local environment of the cs ion .",
    "the polymerized phase @xmath8 is therefore dynamically inhomogeneous and as shown by nmr under pressure , this feature persists up to 9kbar . at ambient pressure static",
    "inhomogeneities gradually develop below 40k concomitantly with a slowing down of spin fluctuations . at 5kbar ,",
    "the polymerized phase @xmath8 undergoes a nonmagnetic transition at @xmath83 equal to 20k .",
    "the ground state is homogeneous and a spin gap opened below 20k . finally ,",
    "a dramatic decrease of the amplitude of the spin gap is observed above 5kbar without any significant decrease of @xmath83 .",
    "the presence of magnetism therefore appears to be closely related to the occurrence of static inhomogeneities .",
    "how does the applied pressure suppress these inhomogeneities and stabilize a homogeneous nonmagnetic ground state ? that can not be addressed by the present work but remains an important issue to be solved .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank f. rachdi for the @xmath84 enriched @xmath71 .",
    "we are also very grateful to c. berthier , s. brasovski , p. carretta , p. sotta and p. wzietek for illuminating discussions and to j. p. cromires and m. nardone for technical assistance.one of the authors ( l.f ) is grateful for the support of the swiss national science foundation .",
    "we can always fit the recovery curve with the expression @xmath85 , @xmath86 being the equilibrium magnetization and @xmath22 a dimensionless coefficient comprised between 0.5 and 1 . at room temperature and at any pressure investigated",
    "@xmath22 is equal to 1 for @xmath87cs whereas a substantial deviation from an exponential recovery is observed i.e @xmath88 for @xmath89c . because of the possible presence of a small amount of pure amorphous c@xmath4 , such deviation might be extrinsic . therefore , we talk about `` exponential recovery '' for @xmath89c as opposed to the dramatic changes in the recovery curve observed at low temperature and which occurrence is unambiguously related to some intrinsic properties of the polymerized phase .",
    "the presence of a quadrupole splitting does not imply a quadrupole relaxation but is consequent to the noncubic symmetry of the local environment of @xmath87cs site .",
    "for a cubic symmetry the three components of the electric field gradient are strictly equal to zero which implies no quadrupole splitting .",
    "however , any fluctuations leading to a substantial deviation from the cubic symmetry may lead to a quadrupole relaxation depending upon the magnitude of the quadrupolar coupling compare to others . for the particular case of @xmath87cs , the possibility of a quadrupole contribution in the relaxation of the magnetization",
    "can be easily ruled out because of the remarkably small value of its quadrupole moment .",
