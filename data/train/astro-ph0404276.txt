    "measurements of large - scale structure from galaxy redshift surveys obviously measure the distribution of luminous matter only ; the total mass distribution will be dominated by dark matter .",
    "the question of how the galaxies trace the total matter density field is therefore extremely pertinent , both to the estimation of cosmological parameters , and also as a probe of the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "a common assumption is ` linear biasing ' , which can be expressed @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the fractional overdensities relative to the mean in galaxies and mass respectively .",
    "this assumption becomes unphysical when @xmath8 since , by definition , @xmath9 , but we can still define a bias parameter , @xmath10 , by e.g. @xmath11 . many of the constraints on cosmological parameters derived from large - scale structure measurements rely on an understanding of galaxy bias . both the 2dfgrs power spectrum analysis ( percival  2001 ) and the constraints obtained for the neutrino mass ( elgary & lahav 2003 ) assume scale independent bias .",
    "joint constraints obtained by combining the 2dfgrs results with measurements of the cmb power spectrum ( percival et al .  2002 ; efstathiou et al .  2002 ; verde et al .",
    "2003 ) also require a model for galaxy bias .",
    "dekel & lahav ( 1999 ) show that nonlinearity and stochasticity in the bias relation can explain discrepancies between different methods of measuring parameters which assume a linear bias factor , such as measurements of @xmath12 ( peacock et al .",
    "2001 ; hawkins et al .  2003 ) .",
    "in fact both theoretical approaches ( mo & white 1996 ) and simulations predict that bias may be non - linear and scale dependent , at least on some ( small ) scales .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find only weak scale dependence on large scales and a bias relation consistent with linear bias .",
    "benson et al .  ( 2000 ) find that semi - analytic galaxies in a lcdm model could reproduce the apm correlation function given a scale dependent bias taking the form of an antibias of galaxies relative to matter on small scales .",
    "somerville et al .  ( 2001 ) also use semi - analytic modelling to demonstrate that the physics of galaxy formation introduces a small scatter in the galaxy  mass relation ; they find the mean bias to have only a weak dependence on scale for @xmath13mpc , ( where the hubble constant , @xmath14@xmath15kms@xmath16 ) .    in principle",
    "the true mass distribution can be directly measured from measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities using e.g.  potent reconstruction ( dekel , bertschinger & faber 1990 ) . in practice accuracy",
    "is hard to achieve by such methods ; the technique requires heavy smoothing since the error bars per galaxy are large and the volumes surveyed up to the present are relatively local .",
    "a useful probe is instead to compare the clustering of different types of galaxy : if these cluster differently , at least one type can not exactly follow the mass distribution .",
    "it has been known for some considerable time that galaxies of different morphological type have different clustering properties .",
    "early - type galaxies , such as ellipticals or s0s , are highly clustered , accounting for almost 90% of galaxies in the cores of rich clusters .",
    "this fraction drops off steeply , however , with distance from the cluster cores and in the field 70% of galaxies are late - type galaxies : spirals and irregulars ( dressler 1980 ; postman & geller 1984 ) .",
    "the level of fluctuations in each of the early- and late - type density fields can also be compared using the correlation functions or power spectra for the two sub - populations .",
    "this kind of study is optimised for small separations ( @xmath17mpc ) and has generally revealed that the clustering amplitude of ellipticals is greater than that of spirals by a factor of 1.31.5 ( e.g.  loveday et al .",
    "1995 ; norberg et al .  2002a ; madgwick et al .",
    "if both density fields were perfectly correlated with the matter density field this factor would be equivalent to the ratio between linear bias parameters @xmath18 .",
    "there is also evidence that the relative bias between sub - populations of galaxies is more complex than the global galaxy bias .",
    "measurements of the 2dfgrs bispectrum ( verde  2002 ) found no evidence for nonlinearity in the bias for 2dfgrs galaxies .",
    "more recently however , kayo  ( 2004 ) find evidence for relative bias being complex on weakly non - linear to non - linear scales from a measurement of the redshift - space three - point correlation function , as a function of galaxy colour and morphology , in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "wild et al . (",
    "2004 ) have carried out a counts - in - cells analysis using volume limited samples from the 2dfgrs , and find evidence for non - linearity and stochastic effects .",
    "a detailed framework for dealing with possible nonlinearities and stochasticity in the bias relation is given by @xcite , based on the joint probability distribution of the galaxy and mass densities @xmath19 . in an analogous manner we will consider the joint probability distribution of the early- and late - type galaxy density fields for magnitude limited samples in the 2dfgrs .",
    "this approach in large part follows the methods described in blanton ( 2000 ) for the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) , although the geometry of the 2dfgrs is considerably more amenable to this kind of study than that of the lcrs and allows us , for example , to examine a large range of scales .",
    "this paper is organised into sections as follows . in section  [ survey ]",
    "we summarize details of the 2dfgrs , the pca-@xmath20 parameter and the division into cells .",
    "we present a measurement of the variances of the counts in cells using the method of efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , which we have corrected for integral constraint bias , in section  [ variances ] .",
    "in section  [ dist_fns ] we present an analysis of the one - point distribution of the counts in cells based on fits to a lognormal distribution function . in section  [ rel_bias ]",
    "we discuss the relative bias .",
    "we present the results of applying the ` modified @xmath1 ' statistic of @xcite to the joint counts in cells and then move on to describe the application of the maximum - likelihood technique of @xcite to constrain the relative bias between spectral types .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the 2dfgrs observations were carried out between may 1997 and april 2002 using the 2df instrument : a multi - object spectrograph on the anglo australian telescope .",
    "the main survey region consists of two broad strips , one in the south galactic pole region ( sgp ) covering approximately @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the other in the direction of the north galactic pole ( ngp ) , spanning @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "in addition there are a number of circular two - degree fields scattered randomly over the full extent of the low extinction regions of the southern apm galaxy survey .",
    "the parent catalogue for the survey was selected in the photometric @xmath25  band from a revised and extended version of the apm galaxy survey ( maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1990a , b , c ; 1996 ) .",
    "the magnitude limit at the start of the survey was set at @xmath26 but both the photometry of the input catalogue and the dust extinction map have since been revised and so there are small variations in magnitude limit as a function of position over the sky",
    ". the effective median magnitude limit , over the area of the survey , is @xmath27 ( colless  2001 ; colless  2003 ) .",
    "the completeness of the survey data varies according to the position on the sky because of unobserved fields ( mostly around the survey edges ) , untargeted objects in observed fields ( due to collision constraints or broken fibres ) and observed objects with poor spectra ; also there are drill - holes around bright stars .",
    "the variation in completeness with angular position , @xmath28 , is fully described by the completeness mask ( colless  2001 ; norberg  2002b ; colless  2003 ) . note",
    "that since we use exclusively those galaxies for which a principal component spectral type has been derived , we require a slightly modified completeness mask from that describing the completeness of the full survey , one which reflects the completeness of galaxies with measured @xmath20-type ( norberg  2002a ) .",
    "we use the completed 2dfgrs data set which was released publicly at the end of june 2003 ( colless  2003 ) .",
    "this includes 221414 unique , reliable galaxy redshifts ( quality flag @xmath29 3 , colless  2001 ; colless  2003 ) .",
    "the random fields , which contain nearly 25000 reliable redshifts , are not included in this analysis . throughout the paper we treat the ngp and sgp regions as independent data sets , which means we have two estimates for each of the statistics we derive .",
    "this approach functions both as a ` reality check ' for our error estimates and also gives an idea of the variation due to cosmic variance .",
    "the spectral properties of 2dfgrs galaxies have been analysed and the galaxies split into spectral type classes using a principal component analysis ( pca ) described by madgwick et al .",
    "this technique splits the galaxies on the basis of the characteristics of their spectra which show the most variation across the sample , without using any prior assumptions or template spectra .",
    "madgwick  ( 2002 ) define a scalar parameter , @xmath20 , which is a linear combination of the first two principal components chosen to minimize instrumental effects which make the determination of the continuum uncertain . in effect",
    ", @xmath20 quantifies the relative strengths of emission and absorption lines , and can be shown to be tightly correlated to the equivalent width of  in particular , so a simple physical interpretation of @xmath20 is as a measure of the current star formation rate in a galaxy ( madgwick et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "the pca classification makes use of the spectral information in the rest - frame wavelength range 3700  to 6650 , which includes all the major optical diagnostics between oii and .",
    "the spectral coverage imposes a limit on the maximum redshift at which this analysis can be used of @xmath30 . for galaxies with @xmath31",
    "however , sky absorption bands contaminate the  line , which affects the stability of the classification . for this reason we restrict our analysis to galaxies with @xmath32 following madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the distribution of  for the 2dfgrs spectra is clearly bimodal ( see fig .  4 of madgwick  2002 ) , with a shoulder at @xmath33 .",
    "madgwick  ( 2002 ) divide galaxies into four spectral type bins based on the shape of this distribution ; the local minimum at @xmath33 is used to separate early and late types while the late type ` shoulder ' is divided in two and also separated from the tail , which will be dominated by particularly active galaxies such as starbursts and agn . because of the effects of possible evolution in the last two spectral type bins , discussed further in the next section , we use only the spectral classes 1 & 2 of madgwick et al.(2002 ) in this paper , which we refer to as early and late type respectively , and exclude the bluer classes 3 & 4 .",
    "the important aspect of the pca classification used here is that it represents a coherent method for dividing a galaxy sample into classes based on a diagnostic with a relatively clear physical interpretation , i.e.  current star formation rate .",
    "note that this specific interpretation will not necessarily be the case for all galaxy samples classified using a pca method ; comparing classifications based on a pca analysis between samples is in general nontrivial . in our case , however , the fact that the pca classification of the 2dfgrs is dominated by  means that a classification of galaxies based on @xmath20 is virtually the same as a classification based on the equivalent width of .      the analysis presented in this paper is complementary to approaches to the study of the relative bias based on correlation functions , in that we compare the two density fields on a point by point basis , rather than measuring overall clustering amplitudes . to estimate the local galaxy density contrast for each type we use the method of counts in cells .",
    "analysis of the 2dfgrs counts in cells has already been used by croton  ( 2004a , b ) and baugh  ( 2004 ) to constrain the higher - order correlation functions and the void probability function .",
    "another respect in which this analysis is complementary to the correlation function approach is that it is optimised for much larger scales .",
    "the method by which we divide the survey region into cells is identical to that first used by @xcite for measuring the variance of the counts in cells for a sparse - sampled redshift survey of iras galaxies @xcite .",
    "first the surveyed region of space is divided into spherical shells of thickness @xmath34 centred on the observer .",
    "each shell is then subdivided into approximately cubical cells using lines of constant right ascension and declination , chosen for each radial distance and declination to ensure that the sides of the cell of length @xmath35 , the shell separation . in this paper",
    "we analyse cell divisions over a range in @xmath34 from @xmath36mpc to @xmath37mpc .",
    "we assume a concordance cosmology of @xmath38 .",
    "effective scales corresponding to a given value of @xmath34 can be computed using the approximate relationship between the radius of a gaussian sphere window , @xmath39 , the radius of a spherical top - hat window , @xmath40 , and @xmath34 , given in eq .",
    "[ scales ] ( peacock 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath41    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we present in table  [ av_bias ] a comparison of the relative bias parameters from all of the measurements presented in the paper .",
    "we have averaged the bias measurements for all scales with @xmath42mpc which we expect to be unaffected by biases from empty cells .",
    "the error bars on each average are obtained assuming that the measurements in adjacent bins in @xmath34 are perfectly correlated , which is a better approximation than assuming the measurements on separate scales are independent .",
    "where relevant we have also used the more realistic error bars obtained from our rayleigh - lvy flight models .",
    "as previously noted , the results for @xmath43 are consistent between regions and also consistent between measurements from direct variance estimation and fitting lognormal models to the one - point distribution .",
    "comparing the two estimates of the linear relative bias parameter @xmath44 , from the maximum likelihood method and from the tegmark test , we find in both cases a significant discrepancy between ngp and sgp regions .",
    "the magnitude of this discrepancy is around 2-@xmath45 . on the other hand",
    "the power - law bias measurements are approximately consistent between regions at a value of @xmath46 which is further from unity . as we noted in section  [ bias ] the assumption of linear bias",
    "when fitting to joint counts in cells which contain a significant degree of nonlinearity pushes the best fit relative bias closer to unity .",
    "this effect was also noted by wild  ( in preparation ) .",
    "it is likely that the apparent discrepancy between ngp and sgp linear bias parameters is also partly an artefact produced when non - linear joint distributions are fit with a linear bias model .      in general ,",
    "the relative bias is expected to be scale dependent on small scales ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the scale at which the bias relation becomes scale independent depends on the scales over which the biasing mechanism(s ) operates .",
    "non - local bias models ( bower et al .",
    "1993 , matsubara 1999 ) are those on which the physical processes acting to produce the bias act on scales larger than those defined by the movement of massive particles , for example those models where radiation from qsos has a significant effect . local bias models ( e.g.  narayanan , berlind & weinberg , 2000 ) are those which are defined by some property of the local matter field , for example its density .",
    "narayanan , berlind & weinberg ( 2000 ) determine the variation with scale of a number of local and non - local bias models applied to n - body simulations .",
    "a general conclusion of this work is that local bias models are generically unable to influence the biasing relation on scales greater than @xmath48mpc , which corresponds to @xmath49mpc in this work .",
    "although there does appear to be some variation of the best fit linear bias parameter on scales @xmath50 , when we factor in the larger error bars derived from models including selection function variation across cells in a more realistic way , the significance of any variation becomes negligible .",
    "even if the variation in the linear bias parameter were significant it would not necessarily imply scale dependence of the bias since there is no significant scale dependence of the best fit power - law bias parameter .",
    "this illustrates the interdependence of non - linear , non - local and stochastic biasing effects .",
    "we conclude that any non - local contribution to the relative bias can not be a dominant effect on large scales .",
    "a special case of local relative bias which was considered in detail by narayanan , berlind & weinberg ( 2000 ) is a local morphology density relation , of the type measured in the local environment of clusters and groups by e.g.  postman & geller ( 1984 ) .",
    "a general conclusion for the relative bias produced by such a local effect is that the constant bias factor to which the scale dependent bias asymptotes on large scales is not equal to unity ; assigning galaxy types based on local density produces a difference in clustering strength of the different galaxy types on all scales .",
    "our results are fully consistent with this picture , which leads on to the question of whether the relatively well studied morphology - density relation can be held solely responsible for the relative bias measured in the 2dfgrs .",
    "the 2dfgrs was made possible through the dedicated efforts of the staff of the anglo - australian observatory , both in creating the 2df instrument and in supporting it on the telescope .",
