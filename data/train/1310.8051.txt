    "an explicit lagrangian description of multiple m2-branes @xcite has opened up a new window to study m - theory or non - perturbative string theory .",
    "it was proposed that @xmath2 multiple m2-branes on @xmath3 are described by @xmath4 supersymmetric chern - simons - matter theory with gauge group @xmath5 and levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 . due to supersymmetry ,",
    "partition function and vacuum expectation values of bps wilson loops in this theory on @xmath8 were reduced to a matrix integration @xcite , which is called the abjm matrix model . here",
    "the coupling constant of the matrix model is related to the level @xmath6 inversely .",
    "the abjm matrix model has taught us much about m - theory or stringy non - perturbative effects . among others ,",
    "we have learned @xcite that it reproduces the @xmath9 behavior of the degrees of freedom when @xmath2 multiple m2-branes coincide , as predicted from the gravity dual @xcite .",
    "also , as we see more carefully below , it was found in @xcite that all the divergences in the worldsheet instantons are cancelled exactly by the membrane instantons .",
    "this reproduces the lesson we learned in the birth of m - theory or non - perturbative strings : string theory is not just a theory of strings .",
    "it is only after we include non - perturbative branes that string theory becomes safe and sound .",
    "after the pioneering paper @xcite which reproduced the leading @xmath9 behavior , the main interest in the study of the abjm matrix model was focused on the perturbative sum @xcite and instanton effects @xcite .",
    "all of the computations in these papers were done in the t hooft limit , @xmath10 with the t hooft coupling @xmath11 held fixed , though for approaching to the m - theory regime with a fixed background , we have to take a different limit .",
    "namely , we have to consider the limit @xmath10 with the parameter @xmath6 characterizing m - theory background fixed @xcite . to overcome this problem , in @xcite",
    "the matrix model was rewritten , using the cauchy determinant formula , into the partition function of a fermi gas system with @xmath2 non - interacting particles , where the planck scale is identified with the level : @xmath12 .",
    "this expression separates the roles of @xmath6 from @xmath2 , which enables us to take the m - theory limit .",
    "note that the m - theory limit probes quite different regimes from the t hooft limit .",
    "especially , using the wkb expansion in the m - theory limit , we can study the @xmath6 expansion of the membrane instantons systematically .    using the fermi gas formalism",
    ", we can also compute several exact values of the partition function with finite @xmath2 at some coupling constants @xcite .",
    "we can extrapolate these exact values to the large @xmath2 regime and read off the grand potential @xcite .",
    "the grand potential reproduces perfectly the worldsheet instanton effects predicted by its dual topological string theory on local @xmath13 when instanton number is smaller than @xmath14 , though serious discrepancies appear beyond it .",
    "namely , the worldsheet instanton part of the grand potential is divergent at some values of the coupling constant , while the partition function of the matrix model is perfectly finite in the whole region of the coupling constant . by requiring the cancellation of the divergences and the conformance to the finite exact values of the partition function at these coupling constants , we can write down a closed expression for the first few membrane instantons for general coupling constants @xcite , which also matches with the wkb expansion . furthermore , using the exact values",
    ", we can study the bound states of the worldsheet instantons and the membrane instantons @xcite .",
    "we also find that the instanton effects consist only of the contributions from the worldsheet instantons , the membranes instantons and their bound states , and no other contributions appear .",
    "finally in @xcite we relate the membrane instanton to the quantization of the spectral curve of the matrix model , which is further related to the refined topological strings on local @xmath13 in the nekrasov - shatashivili limit @xcite .    from the exact solvability viewpoints",
    ", we could say that the abjm matrix model belongs to a new class of solvable matrix models besides that of the gaussian ones and that of the original chern - simons ones .",
    "as we have seen , this class of matrix models can be rewritten into a statistical mechanical model using the cauchy determinant formula and contains an interesting structure of pole cancellations between worldsheet instantons and membrane instantons .",
    "the abjm matrix model is the only example satisfying these properties so far .",
    "the most direct generalization of the abjm theory is the abj theory @xcite with the inclusion of fractional branes .",
    "it was proposed that @xmath4 supersymmetric chern - simons - matter theory with gauge group @xmath15 and the levels @xmath16 describes @xmath17 m2-branes with @xmath18 fractional m2-branes on @xmath3 . the partition function and the vacuum expectation values of the bps wilson loops in the abj theory",
    "are also reduced to matrix models . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume @xmath19 and @xmath20 for expectation values of hermitian operators .",
    "the unitarity constraint requires @xmath21 to satisfy @xmath22 .",
    "the integration measure of the abjm matrix model preserves the super gauge group @xmath23 while that of the abj matrix model preserves @xmath24 @xcite . in the language of the topological string theory",
    ", the abjm matrix model corresponds to the background geometry local @xmath13 with two identical kahler parameters , while the abj matrix model corresponds to a general non - diagonal case .",
    "hence , the abj matrix model is a direct generalization also from this group - theoretical or topological string viewpoint .    in this paper",
    "we would like to study how the nice structures found in @xcite are generalized to the abj matrix model .",
    "we start our project by presenting a fermi gas formalism for the abj matrix model .",
    "our formalism shares the same density matrix as that of the abjm matrix model and hence the same spectral problem @xcite .",
    "the effects of fractional branes are encoded in a determinant factor which takes almost the same form as that of the half - bps wilson loops in the abjm matrix model @xcite .",
    "another interesting fermi - gas formalism was proposed previously by the authors of @xcite . compared with their formulation ,",
    "our formalism has an advantage in the numerical analysis since the density matrix is the same and all the techniques used previously can be applied here directly .    in the formalism of @xcite",
    ", they found that the formula with integration along the real axis is only literally valid for @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath26 , additional poles get across the real axis and we need to deform the integration contour to avoid these poles . here",
    "we find that the same deformation is necessary in our formalism .",
    "besides , we have pinned down the origin of this deformation in the change of variables in the fourier transformation .",
    "we believe that our fermi gas formalism has also cast a new viewpoint to the fractional branes . in string theory",
    ", it was known that graviton sometimes puffs up into a higher - dimensional object , which is called giant graviton @xcite . in the gauge theory picture , this object is often described as a determinant operator .",
    "our fermi gas formalism might suggest an interpretation of the fractional branes in the abj theory as these kinds of composite objects , though the precise identification needs to be elaborated .",
    "later we will see that the derivation of our fermi gas formalism relies on a modification of the frobenius symbol ( see figure [ frobenius ] ) .",
    "since the hook representation has a natural interpretation as fermion excitations , this modification can be regarded as shifting the sea level of the dirac sea .",
    "this observation may be useful for giving a better interpretation of our formula .    using our new formalism we can embark on studying the instanton effects .",
    "first of all , we compute first several exact or numerical values of the partition function . from these studies ,",
    "we find that the phase part of the partition function has a quite simple expression . the grand potential defined by the partition function after dropping the phase factors @xmath27 can be found by fitting the coefficients of the expected instanton expressions using these exact values .",
    "we have found that they match well with a natural generalization of the expression for the perturbative sum , the worldsheet instantons and the bound states of the worldsheet instantons and the membrane instantons in the abjm matrix model .",
    "however , the membrane instanton part contains a new kind of contribution .",
    "finally , we conjecture that the large chemical potential expansion of the grand potential is given by @xmath28 here the perturbative coefficients are @xmath29 while the worldsheet instanton coefficients are @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the gopakumar - vafa invariants of local @xmath32 and @xmath33 . aside from the sign factor @xmath34 ,",
    "the membrane instanton coefficients are the same as in the abjm case @xcite @xmath35 and the bound states are incorporated by @xmath36 note that @xmath37 in is different from @xmath31 in . in terms of the refined topological string invariant @xmath38 , both of them are given as follows @xcite : @xmath39 it should be noticed that , compared with the abjm result , our formula has a non - trivial term multiplied by @xmath40 , which is related to @xmath41 by @xmath42 the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath40 are determined from the quantum mirror map and their explicit form is given in @xcite . if we restrict ourselves to the case of integral @xmath6 , @xmath41 can be read from the following explicit relation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath45    the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",

    ", we can combine the results of the abj partition function and the abjm half - bps wilson loop @xcite in a natural way .",

    "this is explained further by an example in figure [ frobenius ] .",
    "our first observation is the usage of a combination of the cauchy determinant formula and the vandermonde determinant formula @xmath74 here on the right hand side , the upper @xmath75 submatrix and the lower @xmath76 submatrix are given respectively by @xmath77 the determinantal formula can be proved without difficulty by considering the @xmath78 cauchy determinant and sending the extra @xmath79 pieces of @xmath80 to infinity .",
    "here comes the main idea of our computation . without the extra monomials @xmath81 ,",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , the partition function can be rewritten into traces of powers of the density matrices . in the study of the abjm half - bps wilson loop @xcite",
    ", the monomials of the wilson loop insertion play the role of the endpoints in this multiplication of the density matrices .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows : the partition function is expressed by `` closed strings '' of the density matrix while the wilson loops are expressed by `` open strings '' .",

    "this is important not only for ensuring the cancellation of the divergences as we noted in subsection [ polecancel ] , but also for reproducing the correct coefficients of @xmath191 .",
    "thirdly , we confirm that the prescription of introducing the sign factor @xmath34 reproduces correctly the bound states , where there are no pure membrane instanton effects .    as for the constant term in the membrane instanton , there is an ambiguity as long as it does not raise any singularities .",
    "there are two candidates for it : one is of course to take exactly the same constant term as in the abjm case when expressed in terms of the chemical potential @xmath44 .",
    "another choice is to define @xmath117 by respecting the derivative relation .",
    "namely , in the abjm matrix model it was observed that , when the grand potential @xmath192 is expressed in terms of the effective chemical potential @xmath43 , the constant term is the derivative of the linear term .",
    "these two choices give different answers because of the change in @xmath123 .",
    "comparing these two candidates with our numerical results in figure [ grandpotkm ] , we have found that neither of them gives the correct answer . instead , the difference with the latter one is always @xmath193 times bigger than the former one . from this observation ,",
    "we can write down a closed form for our conjecture in . we have checked this conjecture up to seven worldsheet instantons and four membrane instantons .",
    "although we restrict our analysis to the case @xmath25 , we believe our final conjecture is valid for the whole region of @xmath22 because of the consistency with the seiberg duality .",
    "though the expression does not look symmetric in the exchange between @xmath21 and @xmath194 , if we pick up a pair of integers whose sum is @xmath6 , we find two identical instanton expansion series after cancelling the divergences .",
    "we have checked this fact for all the pairs whose sums are @xmath179 .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a fermi gas formalism for the partition function and the half - bps wilson loop expectation values in the abj matrix models .",
    "our formalism identifies the fractional branes in the abj theory as a certain type of wilson loops in the abjm theory .",
    "hence , our formalism shares the same density matrix as that of the abjm matrix model , which is suitable for the numerical studies . we have continued to study the exact or numerical values of the partition function using this formalism . based on these values",
    ", we can determine the instanton expansion of the grand potential at some coupling constants @xmath195 and conjecture the expression for general coupling constants .",
    "let us raise several points which need further clarifications .",
    "the first one is the phase factor of our conjecture .",
    "as we have seen in figure [ fig : phase ] , we have checked this conjecture for @xmath176 carefully .",
    "however when @xmath196 the numerical errors become significant and it is difficult to continue the numerical studies with high accuracy for large @xmath6 .",
    "it is desirable to study it more extensively .",
    "the second one is the relation to the formalism of @xcite , which looks very different from ours .",
    "as pointed out very recently in @xcite it was possible to rewrite the formalism of @xcite into a mirror expression where the physical interpretation becomes clearer .",
    "we would like to see the exact relation between theirs and ours .",
    "thirdly , we have found an extra term in proportional to the quantum mirror map @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we have very few data to identify its appearance and it would be great to check it also from the wkb expansion @xcite , though we are not sure whether the restriction @xmath25 gives any difficulty in the wkb analysis .",
    "furthermore , we can not identify its origin in the refined topological strings or the triple sine functions as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we hope to see its origin in these theories .",
    "it may be a key to understand the gravitational interpretation @xcite of the membrane instantons .",
    "the fourth one is about the wilson loop in the abj theory . after seeing that there are only new terms appearing in the membrane instantons",
    ", we expect that the instanton expansion of the vacuum expectation values of the wilson loop should be expressed similarly as that in the abjm case @xcite .",
    "however , we have not done any numerical studies to support it . also , it is interesting to see how our study is related to other recent works on the abj wilson loops @xcite .",
    "finally , one of the motivation to study the abj matrix model is its relation to the higher spin models .",
    "since we have written down the grand potential explicitly , it is possible to take the limit proposed in @xcite .",

    "<S> this formulation identifies the effect of the fractional m2-brane in the abj matrix model as that of a composite wilson loop operator in the corresponding abjm matrix model . using this formalism , we study the phase part of the abj partition function numerically and find a simple expression for it . </S>",
    "<S> we further compute a few exact values of the partition function at some coupling constants . fitting these exact values against the expected form of the grand potential , we can determine the grand potential with exact coefficients . </S>",

    "<S> the part of the conjectured grand potential from the perturbative sum , worldsheet instantons and bound states is regarded as a natural generalization of that in the abjm matrix model , though the membrane instanton part contains a new contribution .    </S>",
