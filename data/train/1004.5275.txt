    "paradigmatic schematic models of predator  prey interaction that build on the classic lotka ",
    "volterra system @xcite have been widely studied .",
    "specifically , systems with cyclic dominance of competing populations have been suggested to provide a mechanism to promote species diversity ; there are also natural connections to evolutionary game theory @xcite .",
    "a minimal yet non - trivial model for cyclic competition is the three - species cyclic predator  prey system with standard lotka ",
    "volterra predation interactions , essentially equivalent to the familiar rock  paper ",
    "scissors ( rps ) game @xcite .",
    "this rps system has , for example , been used to model the cyclic competitions between three subspecies of certain californian lizards @xcite , and the coevolution of three strains of _ e. coli _ bacteria in microbial experiments @xcite .",
    "other examples include coral reef invertebrates @xcite and overgrowths by marine sessile organisms @xcite . in this simple rps model ,",
    "one lets ` rock ' ( species @xmath0 ) smash ` scissors ' ( species @xmath1 ) , ` scissors ' cut ` paper ' ( species @xmath2 ) , and ` paper ' wrap ` rock ' .",
    "already for a non - spatial rps system , the presence of intrinsic stochastic fluctuations ( reaction noise ) makes the system eventually evolve to one of the three extinction states where only one species survives @xcite .",
    "for example , if the reaction rates in the system are not equal , one intriguingly observes the ` weakest ' species , with the smallest predation rate , to survive , whereas the other two species always die out @xcite .",
    "when the model is extended to include spatial degrees of freedom , say by allowing particles to hop to nearest - neighbor sites on a lattice and interact upon encounter , spatial fluctuations and correlations further complicate the picture .",
    "for instance , species extinction still prevails in one - dimensional rps models @xcite , but the system settles in a coexistence state when the species are efficiently mixed through particle exchange ( but see also ref .",
    "in contrast , two - dimensional rps systems are characterized by coexistence of the competing species , and the emergence of complex spatio - temporal structures such as spiral patterns @xcite .",
    "recently , reichenbach _",
    "et al . _ extensively studied the four - state rps model without conservation law @xcite , and it is now well - established that cyclic reactions in conjunction with diffusive spreading generate spiral patterns ( when the system is sufficiently mixed ) . in model variants that incorporate conservation of the total population density ,",
    "on the other hand , spiral patterns do not occur @xcite ; also , when the species mobility is drastically enhanced through fast particle exchange processes , the spiral patterns are destroyed as well , and the system eventually reaches an extinction state @xcite .",
    "this work is motivated by the following question : which are the crucial model ingredients to be included in order to attain a further degree of realism ? to this end , we carried out monte carlo simulation studies on the influence of the carrying capacity and environmental inhomogeneity on the properties of a class of spatial rps models where the total population size is conserved ( zero - sum games ) @xcite . in our stochastic lattice models ,",
    "the carrying capacity ( i.e. , the maximum population size that can be sustained by the environment ) is implemented through site occupation number restrictions .",
    "environmental variability is modeled through assigning local reaction rates that are treated as quenched random variables drawn from a uniform distribution .",
    "our extensive numerical study shows that carrying capacity and quenched disorder have little influence on the oscillatory dynamics , spatial correlation functions , and extinction times in the rps model system .",
    "this demonstrates a quite remarkable robustness of this class of models . from a modeling perspective , this establishes the essential equivalence of rather distinct model variants .",
    "we emphasize that this outcome is nontrivial , as is , for example , revealed by a comparison with the two - species lotka - volterra system @xcite , where spatially varying reaction rates may cause more localized clusters of activity and thereby enhance the fitness of both predator and prey species @xcite .",
    "naturally , lattice models should be viewed as coarse - grained representations of a metapopulation system where each lattice site or cell can be interpreted as a ` patch ' ( or ` island ' ) populated by a ` deme ' ( or ` local community ' ) @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity ( i.e. to try to understand the simplest possible systems before venturing further ) , we here restrict our presentation to rps model variants that obey a conservation law ( even though that has no particular ecological motivation ) . as empty lattice sites are allowed , we shall refer to our model system as a class of four - state rps models with conservation law ( if all sites are at most occupied by a single individual , each of them can be in one of four states ) .",
    "while the presence or absence of the conservation of the total number of particles is crucial for the emergence of spiral waves in rps systems  @xcite , this is not the case for the properties studied here .",
    "in fact , it turns out that our conclusions on the effects ( or lack thereof ) of limited carrying capacity and random environmental influences on the transient population oscillations , spatial correlation functions , and species extinction times are common to models both with and without conservation laws @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we define our model , the stochastic four - state spatial rock  paper  scissors ( rps ) game or cyclic three - species predator  prey system with conservation of total population density , and briefly review the results obtained from the mean - field rate equation approximation . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce our monte carlo simulation algorithm and discuss the detailed model variants we have explored .",
    "we then present results for the species time - dependent densities , associated frequency power spectra , and spatial correlation functions to analyze the influence of quenched spatial disorder in the reaction rates and site occupation restriction on the temporal evolution and quasi - stationary states of this system , both in two dimensions and for a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we also compare our numerical findings with the mean - field predictions , and obtain the mean extinction time ( for the first species to die out ) as function of system size .",
    "finally , we provide a summary of our results and concluding remarks .",
    "the rock  paper  scissors ( rps ) model describes the cyclic competition of three interacting species that we label @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the following ( zero - sum @xcite ) predator  prey type interactions : @xmath3 note that these irreversible reactions strictly conserve the total number of particles .",
    "we remark that naturally other variants of the rps dynamics could also be considered ; notably the four - state may  leonard model which does not conserve the total particle density @xcite has attracted considerable attention , see e.g. refs .",
    "as will be demonstrated elsewhere , the conclusions presented here on the effects of carrying capacity and spatial reaction rate variability remain essentially unchanged for this system @xcite . to generalize the above reaction model to a spatially extended lattice version ,",
    "we allow empty sites ( as a fourth possible state ) and let the reactions happen only between nearest neighbors .",
    "in addition , we introduce nearest - neighbor particle hopping with rate @xmath4 ( if at most one particle is allowed per lattice site , this process takes place only if an adjacent empty site becomes selected at each time step ) .    within the mean - field approximation , wherein any correlations and spatial variations are neglected , the following set of three coupled rate equations for homogeneous population densities @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , with fixed total population density @xmath8 describes the system s temporal evolution , @xmath9 \\ , ,    \\nonumber \\\\    \\partial_t \\ , b(t ) & = & b(t ) \\left [ k_b \\ , c(t ) - k_a \\ , a(t ) \\right ] \\ , , \\\\",

    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 , and utilizing the conservation law @xmath14 , we may express the first two rate equations in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "linearizing about the reactive fixed point then gives @xmath17 with the linear stability matrix @xmath18 with eigenvalues @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents a characteristic oscillation frequency , e.g. , for total density @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the typical frequency is @xmath26 .",
    "we will use these mean - field values later to compare with the simulation results . in the special case of symmetric reaction rates",
    "where @xmath27 , we get @xmath28 ; for example , if @xmath21 and @xmath29 , then @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in addition",
    ", the system also has three absorbing states , with only a single species surviving ultimately : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . within the mean - field approximation ,",
    "these fixed points are all linearly unstable .",
    "however , in any stochastic model realization on a finite lattice , temporal evolution would ultimately terminate in one of these absorbing states , as we shall explore for small systems below .",
    "we investigate stochastic rps systems on one- and two - dimensional lattices with periodic boundary conditions . at each time step ,",
    "one individual of any species is selected at random , then hops to a nearest - neighbor site , if the number of particles on the chosen target site is empty .",
    "otherwise , one of the particles on the chosen neighboring site is selected randomly and undergoes a reaction with the center particle according to the scheme and rates specified by ( [ react ] ) if both particles are different .",
    "the outcome of the reaction then replaces the eliminated particle .",
    "note that predation reactions always involve neighboring particles ; on - site reactions do not occur .",
    "this has the advantage of permitting us to treat the model variants with and without site occupation number restriction within the same setup , allowing for direct comparison .",
    "a similar approach was already adopted for the two - species lattice lotka ",
    "volterra model , where we confirmed earlier that nearest - neighbor predation interactions and strictly on - site reactions lead ( without loss of generality ) to essentially identical macroscopic features @xcite .",
    "if the selected and focal particle are of the same species , the center particle just hops to its chosen neighboring site . for our model variants with site occupancy restriction",

    "we find that only a single species ultimately survives and eventually occupies the whole lattice no matter whether spatial disorder or site restrictions are included in the model : as expected , the one - dimensional system will always evolve towards one of the three extinction states where two of the three species will die out .",
    "while this phenomenon also occurs in two dimensions , in @xmath46 the species coexist over a time that on average scales polynomially with the system size ( see below ) , i.e. , extinction happens on a much shorter time scale than in two dimensions ( see fig .

    "an algebraic decay of the number of domains was also reported in ref .",

    "we observe exponential decay with similar large correlation lengths for all model variants upto about 50 lattice sites , followed by a cutoff ( which extends to larger @xmath55 as time increases ) .",

    "for which the statistical errors are likely better controlled , our results may even be consistent with the mean - field value @xmath64 .",
    "note , however , that the extinction time distribution acquires even fatter tails at large times than in two dimensions , see fig .",
    "[ fig17:exds2 ] , and rare long survival events dominate the averages and induce large statistical fluctuations .",
    "the mean extinction time alone therefore poorly characterizes the extinction kinetics .",
    "when the reaction rates are chosen asymmetric , we have checked that only the ` weakest ' species with the smallest predation rate survives , whereas the other two species are driven to extinction  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effects of finite carrying capacity and spatial variability in the reaction rates on the dynamics of a class of spatial rock  paper ",
    "scissors ( rps ) models .",
    "we have investigated the properties of several variants of the stochastic four - state zero - sum rps game ( with conserved total particle number ) on two- and one - dimensional lattices with periodic boundary conditions . in two dimensions , owing to the strict ( local ) conservation of the total particle number",
    ", one does not observe the formation of spiral patterns ; the three species simply form small clusters .",
    "in fact , spatial correlations are weak in the ( quasi - stationary ) coexistence state , and the system is remarkably well described by the mean - field rate equation approximation .",
    "typical extinction times scale exponentially with system size @xcite , resulting in coexistence of all three species already on moderately large lattices .",
    "we find the characteristic initial oscillation frequency to be proportional to the reaction rate and total particle density , as predicted by mean - field theory .",
    "we observe that neither site occupation number restrictions nor quenched spatial disorder in the reaction rates markedly modify the populations temporal evolution , species density fourier signals , or equal - time spatial correlation functions .",
    "this observation holds for models with symmetric as well as asymmetric reaction rates , and even if spatial variability is introduced only for the competition of one species pair . on the basis of the mean - field results ,",
    "this very weak disorder effect is a consequence of the essentially _ linear _ dependence of the long - time densities on the reaction rates @xmath65 ; averaging over a symmetric distribution just yields the average . in the two - species lotka  volterra model , instead both the asymptotic predator and prey densities are inversely proportional to the predation rate , and averaging over a distribution of the latter strongly biases towards small rate values and large densities @xcite .",
    "both in the two- and cyclic three - species systems , spatially variable rates induce stronger localization of the species clusters .    in one dimension ,",
    "two species are driven towards extinction with the mean extinction time @xmath57 , @xmath66 ( with large error bars ) , and only a single species survives .",
    "the distribution of extinction times displays fat long - time tails .",
    "we confirm that the single - species domains grow with the predicted power law @xmath54 in the models with site restrictions @xcite , and we have obtained similar results for the model variants with an infinite carrying capacity . for asymmetric reaction rates ,",
    "we have also checked that the ` weakest ' species is the surviving one @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that the physical properties of cyclic rps models are quite robust , even quantitatively , with respect to modifications of their ` microscopic ' model definitions and characterization .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the related two - species lotka  volterra predator - prey interaction model .",
    "we believe the origin of this remarkable robustness lies in the comparatively weaker prominence of stochastic fluctuations and spatial correlations in the cyclic three - species system .",
    "the robustness of the rps models considered here implies that environmental noise can be safely ignored and that their properties are essentially independent of the carrying capacity .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this result is nontrivial ; in terms of modeling such systems , it notably implies that one has the freedom to consider strict site restriction ( @xmath36 ) and hence simplify the numerical calculations , or to set @xmath67 ( no site restrictions ) and thus facilitate the mathematical treatment .",
    "in fact , our study establishes that both ` microscopic ' model realizations are essentially equivalent .",
    "as it turns out , this conclusion also pertains to spatial may ",

    "<S> we study several variants of the stochastic four - state rock  paper  scissors game or , equivalently , cyclic three - species predator  prey models with conserved total particle density , by means of monte carlo simulations on one- and two - dimensional lattices . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we investigate the influence of spatial variability of the reaction rates and site occupancy restrictions on the transient oscillations of the species densities and on spatial correlation functions in the quasi - stationary coexistence state . for small systems , we also numerically determine the dependence of typical extinction times on the number of lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> in stark contrast with two - species stochastic lotka  </S>",
    "<S> volterra systems , we find that for our three - species models with cyclic competition quenched disorder in the reaction rates has very little effect on the dynamics and the long - time properties of the coexistence state . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we observe that site restriction only has a minor influence on the system s dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> our results therefore demonstrate that the features of the spatial rock  paper  scissors system are remarkably robust with respect to model variations , and stochastic fluctuations as well as spatial correlations play a comparatively minor role . </S>"
