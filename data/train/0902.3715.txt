    "it was brought to our attention that the same result was independently obtained by mitsumatsu and mori in @xcite .",
    "bennequin used braid theory in @xmath0 to show the standard contact structure was tight . since then , the main way to show a contact structure is tight is to use powerful analytic machinery like holomorphic curves or seiberg - witten theory . by studying braids in general open books",
    "it is hoped that tightness can be better understood from a purely topological / combinatorial perspective .",
    "the results presented in this paper constitute a first step in this program .",
    "while these results are purely geometric , it would be nice to have an algebraic description of a generalized @xmath4braid group@xmath4 .",
    "in particular , one needs to define the stabilization moves with respect to different binding components and account for the fundamental group of the page .",
    "we will explore this algebraic perspective in a subsequent paper .    in @xcite , markov gave an equivalent condition for the closures or two braids in @xmath0 to be isotopic as knots .",
    "this is the case if and only if the two braids differ by conjugations in the braid group and positive and negative markov moves . in @xcite ,",
