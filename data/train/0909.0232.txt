    "the supercluster environment and its constituent structures have a role in the processes of galaxy star formation and its associated triggering mechanisms .",
    "mature ( low @xmath1 ) and dense superclusters ( @xmath2 ) like the horologium - reticulum supercluster ( hrs ) of galaxies are the products of the formation of rich galaxy clusters , and they are also dependent on the evolution of mature voids ( @xmath3@xmath4  mpc ) . by using specific examples from the hrs ,",
    "the purpose is to present some of the recent results in galaxy supercluster studies as they relate to star formation in galaxies .",
    "the hrs is one of the largest supercluster complexes of galaxies in the low @xmath1 universe ( @xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a rich dataset comprised primarily of optical spectroscopy and radio continuum photometry over small ( e.g. , @xmath5 deg@xmath6 , * ?",
    "* ) and wide ( @xmath7 deg@xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) areas on the sky has provided the context for examining star formation on a variety of scales .",
    "in fact , knowledge of the the supercluster environment via such a comprehensive dataset provides a key in connecting the specific indications of star formation with their respective mechanism(s ) .",
    "the presentation of the results will follow an order - of - magnitude approach in obtaining perspectives of the supercluster environment on the scales of 100 , 10 , and 1 megaparsecs .",
    "it is well - known that superclusters of galaxies are regions of higher galaxy density and are populated by a larger percentage of quiescent , early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* tab .  1 ) , which follows from a general understanding of the morphology - density relation extended out to galaxy superclusters @xcite .",
    "therefore as a whole , star forming galaxies are seemingly less - likely to reside within superclusters when compared to field galaxies .",
    "however running counter to the suppression of star - formation in galaxies due to dense environments , some studies find an enhancement of star formation associated with galaxy filaments that stretch on the order of 1050@xmath4  mpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "one potential cause for this enhancement is thought to occur due to an increase in low - velocity galaxy mergers or recent tidal interaction that occur more readily in gas - rich , poorer groups .",
    "the increase in galaxy density within superclusters is not uniform , where clusters and filaments with higher density are contrasted against voids of lower density .",
    "figure 1 shows the hrs survey volume as presented with the interactive , 3d visualization tool , gyve @xcite .",
    "specifically , intercluster galaxies are shown by the filled gray spheres , galaxy clusters by the filled cylinders , and mature voids ( @xmath3@xmath4  mpc ) with numbers .",
    "these mature voids are completely absent of the fairly bright galaxies ( @xmath8 ) selected for our survey @xcite , which was carried out in conjunction with the six - degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs , * ? ? ?",
    "particular to the case of star formation , filaments of galaxies that stretch on the order of 1050@xmath4  mpc are detected on the peripheries of mature voids ( @xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "guided by the understanding that merger interactions are potentially heightened in supercluster filaments and the observation that void peripheries contain such filamentary structures in the hrs , galaxies located at the void periphery are examined for enhanced star formation and for understanding the mechanism(s ) provoking the enhancement .",
    "similarly , @xcite used sloan and 2df observations of galaxies in ` void walls ' to show that there are increases in star formation occurring in bluer galaxies across a wide range in both luminosity and local density .",
    "ceccareli et al .",
    "attribute the modulation in star formation within these galaxies to the differing evolutionary history that void galaxies undergo ( i.e. , less disruptive ) when compared with normal field galaxies .    to quantify the amount of star formation taking place in galaxies located within @xmath9 ( i.e. , the void rim ) , the h@xmath10 emission line equivalent widths ( ew ) were measured from the 6dfgs spectra .",
    "galaxies are classified as `` active star formers '' when they display an ew(h@xmath10 ) @xmath11  ( this value correlates closely with the 2dfgrs @xmath12 that also indicates star formation , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when comparing the ratios of star - forming and passive galaxies in void rims to those in einasto et al .",
    ", we find that active star - formation is elevated in bright ( @xmath13 ) galaxies by @xmath1430%  above normal levels in the supercluster ( 210 of 417 total 6df galaxies ) .    to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of the active star - forming galaxies , figure 2 shows a representative color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) for void rim galaxies in the hrs .",
    "open circles represent galaxies in the void rim and filled circles represent galaxies that have measurements consistent with active star formation .",
    "while the @xmath15 and @xmath16 photometric measures are subject to modest errors ( @xmath17mags ) , most of these star forming galaxies are above @xmath18 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* in the 2dfgrs ) .",
    "therefore , our results are consistent with previous studies in showing a range of luminosities undergoing active star formation , but they do not seem tightly correlated with explicitly bluer populations .",
    "since the cmr does not show a definite color segregation for the active star - forming galaxies , photometric images are examined for signature signs of merging activity ( e.g. , faint near neighbors , asymmetric or warped disks , etc . ) . of the active star - forming galaxies in the 6df void rims ,",
    "approximately half ( @xmath19% ) contain some signature of interaction .",
    "figure 3 shows representative examples of closely - neighbored , star - forming galaxies , often between brighter star - forming galaxies and faint bluer galaxies ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) from the total sample of 210 galaxies .",
    "the moderate density environment of filaments combined with the low velocities consistent with void evolution seem to suggest that conditions are favorable for tidal and merging interactions .",
    "with detailed information of the hrs filament  cluster network @xcite , plus recent results linking star formation to the infall region around galaxy clusters along filament axes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the view of the hrs is now restricted to the periphery of the rich galaxy cluster , a3158 .",
    "specifically , a3158 is a member of a 10@xmath4  mpc intercluster filament that forms a large portion of the southern hrs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the 1.4 ghz luminosity function of a3158 at radio wavelengths shows an apparent suppression of agn - type emission at higher radio power when compared with representative galaxy clusters , which is interpreted as a cluster in the later stages of merging @xcite . in combination with the suppression of emission at higher radio power around the cluster ,",
    "johnston - hollitt et al.also find a significant excess of low - power radio galaxies at 1.4ghz ( i.e. , @xmath22 w hz@xmath23 ) seemingly aligned with the a3158 intercluster filament axis that also contains two , bright cd galaxies ( see fig .  10 , * ? ? ?",
    "such values of radio emission are often associated with star - formation occurring at modest rates , sfr@xmath24 yr@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "having identified a potential population of star - forming galaxies using statistical measures ( i.e. , radio source counts and luminosity function ) , the characteristics of these galaxies are examined to better understand the mechanism(s ) responsible for the burst of star - formation . while it has recently been",
    "observed that galaxies along filament axes undergo a burst of star formation at larger distances ( @xmath252@xmath4  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many of the low - power radio galaxies in a3158 are located at projected distances of @xmath26@xmath4  mpc ( less than the virial radius ) .",
    "so deep within the cluster core , it is expected that star - formation mechanisms must coincide with higher velocities caused by the gravitational potential .",
    "coupled with the previous observations of a relatively large axi - symmetric x - ray temperature distribution @xcite , which also aligns with the radio galaxy ",
    "intercluster filament axis , stripping - induced star formation within the fainter and bluer populations of radio galaxies is a plausible mechanism .",
    "some radio galaxies located at these distances also exhibit optical emission ( @xmath27 $ ] and h@xmath28 , @xcite ) also consistent with a star - forming population ( but is not required , see * ? ? ?",
    "icm stripping is also observed in detail for similar cluster galaxies ( bluer and fainter ) at equivalent distances , where galaxy transformations are apparently occurring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a rich , multi - wavelength dataset reveals the hrs to contain a variety of filamentary substructures that seem to facilitate star - formation in member galaxies .",
    "specifically , statistical measures based on optical ( ews ) and radio ( source counts ) datasets indicate the presence of enhanced star - forming populations in both lower density ( void periphery ) and higher density ( cluster ) environments . in both cases , galaxy filaments apparently aid the density - specific mechanisms .",
    "filaments are effective organizers of material to provide a low - velocity environment with increased density , where star formation mechanisms like mergers and tidal interactions can operate effectively ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in higher density environments with",
    "increased infall velocities , galaxy filaments appear to be conduits for icm interactions ( like stripping ) within fainter and bluer members @xcite .",
