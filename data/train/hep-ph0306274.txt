    "recently babar collaboration announced a positive - parity narrow state with a rather low mass @xmath12 mev in the @xmath13 channel @xcite , which was confirmed by cleo @xcite and belle @xcite later .",
    "because of its low mass and decay angular distribution , its @xmath14 is believed to be @xmath5 . in the same experiment cleo",
    "@xcite observed a state at @xmath15 mev with the possible spin - parity @xmath16 in the @xmath17 channel .",
    "babar @xcite also found a signal near there .",
    "since these two states lie below @xmath18 and @xmath19 threshold respectively , the potentially dominant s - wave decay modes @xmath20 etc are kinematically forbidden .",
    "thus the radiative decays and isospin - violating strong decays become favorable decay modes .",
    "the later decay goes in two steps with the help of virtual @xmath21 intermediate states , @xmath22 where the second step arises from the tiny @xmath23-@xmath24 isospin - violating mixing due to @xmath25 .",
    "the experimental discovery of these two states has triggered heated debate on their nature recently in literature .",
    "the key point is to understand their low masses .",
    "the @xmath3 mass is significantly lower than the values of @xmath5 mass in the range of @xmath26 gev calculated in quark models of @xcite .",
    "the model using the heavy quark mass expansion of the relativistic bethe - salpeter equation in @xcite predicted a lower value @xmath27 gev of @xmath5 mass which is still 50 mev higher than the experimental data .",
    "bardeen , eichten and hill interpreted them as the @xmath0 @xmath1 spin doublet as the parity conjugate states of the @xmath28 doublet in the framework of chiral symmetry@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "a quark - antiquark picture was also advocated by colangelo and fazio @xcite , cahn and jackson @xcite , godfrey @xcite .",
    "based on such a `` conventional '' picture , the various decay modes were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "apart from the quark - antiquark interpretation , @xmath3 was suggested to be a four - quark state by cheng and hou @xcite and barnes , close and lipkin @xcite .",
    "szczepaniak even argued that it could be a strong @xmath29 atom @xcite ! but we think it would be very exceptional for a molecule or atom to have a binding energy as large as @xmath30 mev .",
    "van beveren and rupp @xcite argued from the experience with @xmath31 that the low mass of @xmath3 could arise from the mixing between @xmath18 continuum and the lowest scalar nonet . in this way",
    "the @xmath5 @xmath0 state is artificially pushed much lower than that expected from quark models .",
    "the recent lattice calculation suggests a value around @xmath32 gev for @xmath5 state mass @xcite , much larger than the experimentally observed @xmath3 and compatible with quark model predictions .",
    "the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite is that @xmath3 might receive a large component of @xmath18 and the physics might resemble @xmath33 .",
    "such a large @xmath18 component makes lattice simulation very difficult .    in this paper",
    "we shall use qcd sum rules @xcite in the framework of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite to extract the masses since hqet provides a systematic method to compute the properties of heavy hadrons containing a single heavy quark via the @xmath34 expansion , where @xmath35 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "the masses of ground state heavy mesons have been studied with qcd sum rules in hqet in @xcite . in @xcite masses of the lowest excited non - strange heavy meson doublets @xmath36 and @xmath2",
    "were studied with the sum rules in hqet up to the order of @xmath37 .",
    "these masses were also analyzed in the earlier works @xcite with sum rules in full qcd . in this short note",
    "we extend the same formalism in @xcite to include the light quark mass in calculating the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we shall also use more stringent criteria for the stability windows of the sum rules in the numerical analysis .",
    "the proper interpolating current @xmath39 for a state with the quantum numbers @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 in hqet was given in @xcite .",
    "these currents were proved to satisfy the following conditions @xmath43&&\\times\\ : \\int \\,dt\\delta(x - vt)\\:\\pi_{p , j_{\\ell}}(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath44 limit , where @xmath45 is the polarization tensor for the spin @xmath40 state , @xmath46 is the velocity of the heavy quark , @xmath47 is the transverse metric tensor , @xmath48 denotes symmetrizing the indices and subtracting the trace terms separately in the sets @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are a constant and a function of @xmath53 respectively which depend only on @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we consider the correlator @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",

    "we shall study the low - lying @xmath62 @xmath63 states .",
    "the values of various qcd condensates are @xmath64 we use @xmath65 gev for the strange quark mass in the @xmath66 scheme .",
    "we use @xmath67 mev for three active flavors and @xmath68 mev for four active flavors .",
    "the sum rules with massless light quarks have been obtained in @xcite .    in the numerical analysis of the qcd sum rules",
    "we require that the high - order power corrections be less than @xmath69 of the perturbation term .",
    "this condition yields the minimum value @xmath70 of the allowed borel parameter .",
    "we also require that the pole term , which is equal to the sum of the cut - off perturbative term and the condensation terms , is larger than @xmath71 of the perturbative term , which leads to the maximum value @xmath72 of the allowed @xmath73 .",
    "thus we have the working interval @xmath74 for a fixed @xmath61 . if @xmath75 , we are unable to extract useful information from such a sum rule . in the ideal case , the difference between the meson mass @xmath76 and the heavy quark mass @xmath35 ( or other observables ) is almost independent on @xmath73 for certain values of @xmath61 .",
    "namely , the dependence on both the borel parameter and continuum threshold is minimum . in realistic cases ,",
    "the variation of a sum rule with both @xmath73 and @xmath61 will contribute to the errors of the extracted value , together with the truncation of the operator product expansion and the uncertainty of vacuum condensate values .    in subsections 2.1 and 2.2",
    "we give sum rules for @xmath1 and @xmath2 doublets using interpolating currents with derivatives , respectively .",

    "we would like to make some remarks .",
    "usually , the currents with the least number of derivatives are used in qcd sum rule approaches .",
    "the sum rules then are less sensitive to the threshold energy @xmath61 .",
    "however , it is pointed out in @xcite that in the non - relativistic limit the coupling constant of these currents to the p wave states vanishes . if this coupling constant is suppressed due to this reason , the relative importance of the contribution of the @xmath105 and other states in continuum in the sum rules which are usually neglected would be enhanced . besides",
    ", it is shown in @xcite by using soft pion theorem that the contribution of the @xmath106 continuum is large in the sum rule with the non - derivative current for the @xmath5 state of the non - strange @xmath107 system and significantly decreases the value of @xmath83 .",
    "similar method of calculation is not good in the present case , but it indicates that the contribution of the @xmath105 continuum with the non - derivative current may be large too .    [ fig4 ]",
