    "this method removes a substantial amount of the sky gradient and allows us to detect many galaxies within the psf wing . however , one notable weakness of this method is that many high - frequency features remain after the subtraction because the spatial resolution of the sky estimation by swarp is limited . in the second method ,",
    "we preserve the sky level in our image reduction and only subtract the psf from the final co - add after modeling the psf profile .",
    "judging from visual inspection , we believe that the second method is superior in terms of high - frequency feature removal .",

    "the coordinate transformation by gravitational lensing in a weak - lensing regime is often expressed by the following matrix @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are convergence and reduced shears , respectively .",

    "similarly , a positive value of @xmath46 is responsible for the elongation along the direction defined by the function @xmath47 ( i.e. , 45@xmath48 with respect to the @xmath44-axis .",

    "an analytic first - order correction is derived by seitz & schneider ( 1997 ) , and we apply the method to our analysis .",
    "the matrix ( eqn .  [ eqn_lens_trans ] ) transforms a circle into an ellipse , and the resulting ellipticity becomes @xmath25 when we define ellipticity as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the semimajor and semiminor axes , respectively .",
    "therefore , when no bias is present , the measurement of @xmath25 is simply averaging the object s ( ideal ) ellipticities .",

    "extensive discussions on these challenges are available in the literature , and for some challenges many state - of - the - art algorithms meet or exceed the requirements that many future weak - lensing surveys demand ( mandelbaum et al .",
    "below we briefly describe our shape measurement method , which turns out to be among the best - performing methods in the 3rd gravitational lensing accuracy testing ( great3 ; mandelbaum et al . 2014 ; 2015 ) .",
    "the great3 challenges include realistic psfs and their spatial variations , realistic galaxy morphologies , multi - epoch data , etc .",
    "we model an observed ( smeared by psf ) galaxy image with a convolution of an elliptical gaussian function @xmath70 and a psf @xmath71 : @xmath72 the elliptical gaussian function @xmath70 has four parameters , namely , the semimajor axis @xmath73 , the semiminor axis @xmath74 , the position angle @xmath67 , and the normalization @xmath75 ; we let the centroid remain fixed .",
    "@xmath71 is computed by applying principal component analysis ( pca ) to stellar images .",
    "our psf modeling scheme is different between subaru and _ hst_. for subaru , each ccd frame contains a sufficient number ( @xmath76 ) of high s / n ( @xmath77 ) stars , which enables us to apply pca directly to science images ( jee & tyson 2011 ) .",
    "this is not the case for hst , whose small field of view ( @xmath78 ) normally provides only 10 - 20 high s / n stars therefore , we use external stellar field images and construct psf libraries from them ( jee et al .",
    "of course , it is necessary to find a matching psf template from the library for each science frame , where we measure weak lensing .",
    "this template matching between science and stellar fields is possible because the _ hst _ psf pattern is repeatable , largely determined by the focus as empirically demonstrated by jee et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "schrabback et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggest that perhaps two parameters might be needed to better characterize the psf pattern of a given acs exposure .",
    "going back to the issue of ellipticity measurement , we minimize the difference between @xmath79 and the observed galaxy profile @xmath80 .",
    "we refer to the ellipticity from this measurement as raw ellipticity @xmath81 .",
    "this raw ellipticity @xmath81 is slightly offset from the ideal ellipticity @xmath82 above , which we convert to the reduced shear by straightforward averaging .",
    "the sources of the bias include noise bias , model bias , truncation bias , etc ( see mandelbaum et al .",
    "2015 for details ) .",
    "thus , we modify the above equation  [ eqn_e_ave ] as follows : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the inverse - variance weight , @xmath85 @xmath86 is @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the multiplicative bias , which is empirically determined from our image simulations ( e.g. , jee & tyson 2011 ; jee et al .",
    "the simulated images match the depth , resolution , and source density of our science images , which are necessary to capture the dependence on imperfect deblending , psf size , noise level , etc .",
    "although we find that the multiplicative bias @xmath88 is a function of several parameters such as s / n , size , and surface brightness , we derive a single value that represents the mean correction for the entire source population . for hst and subaru data ,",
    "we obtain @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively ; in the derivation of these calibration factors , we also apply the same source selection criteria discussed in [ section_source_selection ] .",
    "apart from this multiplicative bias , additive bias is present especially when psfs are severely elongated .",
    "we find that the mean level of additive bias is a few percent of the psf ellipticity .",

    "we identify at least four luminosity peaks , and three of them ( l1 , l2 , and l4 ) are resolved by the subaru weak lensing .",
    "because of the bright ( @xmath127 ) star in the field center , there is a nonnegligible chance that the substructures around the star may be affected , although we carefully subtract the stellar light profile and attempt to use as many galaxies as possible in the neighborhood .",
    "we suspect that the influence on the mass peak near l1 is minor because of its significant lensing signal ( some strong - lensing features are also visible ) .",
    "however , interpretation of the substructure near l4 needs caution because it is very close to the star and also the peak significance is weaker despite the apparent alignment between light and mass .",

    "the significance estimates of p3 and p4 are somewhat weaker than these two peaks , but their detections are statistically nonnegligible .",

    ", the result shows that the mass structure of rx  j0603.3 + 4214  is by and large bimodal with the two mass components corresponding to the two strongest luminosity peaks .",
    "these two mass peaks are also collinear with the two x - ray peaks and the  brush \" of the  toothbrush \" radio relic",
    ".                  accurate determination of cluster masses is challenging even for relaxed systems .",
    "various systematic errors , as well as differences in analysis method , can lead to @xmath142% offsets for the population mean and up to @xmath143% scatters for individual systems among different studies ( e.g. , von der linden et al .",
    "2014 ; merten et al .",
    "2015 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the issue becomes even more complex when one studies merging clusters .",
    "to say the least , merging clusters are believed to show more departure from conventional analytic profiles , and their lensing signals should be modeled as a superposition of a few or more halos .",
    "often , determining how many halos should be assumed and where they are placed for a given system is not straightforward . in jee",
    "et al . ( 2014 ; 2015 ) , we demonstrated that catastrophic ( @xmath144% ) over- or under - estimation can arise if the traditional method , which applies a single analytic profile to azimuthally averaged lensing signals , is employed .",
    "in mass estimation of rx  j0603.3 + 4214 , we follow the approach of jee et al .",
    "( 2014 ; 2015 ) , where the merging systems are modeled as a binary system .",
    "this binary assumption can be considered questionable in  rx  j0603.3 + 4214 , where the cluster galaxy and mass distributions are somewhat complex , but the inclusion of more than two halos leads to numerical instability in the current case . nevertheless ,",
    "since our final mass map based on _ hst _ and subaru indicates that the total mass is dominated by the two strongest mass peaks associated with the two most luminous halos , we believe that the amount of bias with a two - halo model would not be substantial . in [ section_mass_left_behind ] , we demonstrate that this bias , if any , is indeed small and within statistical errors by comparing this mass estimate with aperture mass densitometry , which does not require assumptions on the underlying mass distribution .    while fitting two nfw profiles simultaneously , we assume the mass - concentration relation of duffy et al . ( 2008 ) and fix the two halo centers at the two brightest luminosity centers . unlike ciza  j2242.8 + 5301",
    ", fixing the centers is necessary for rx  j0603.3 + 4214   because of the relatively low mass ( thus low amplitude of the lensing signal ) of the system .",
    "we excluded the shears at the core of each halo by choosing @xmath119 and @xmath145 for p1 and p2 , respectively in order to avoid potential bias from enhanced cluster member contamination near the core and signal confusion between strong / weak lensing regimes .",
    "the duffy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) relation has a considerable scatter . in jee",
    "et al . ( 2009 ) , we examined the impact of this scatter on the mass uncertainty of the high - redshift cluster xmmu j2235.3 - 2557 at @xmath146 and showed that the uncertainty from this mass - concentration scatter is @xmath147% .",
    "as this error from the mass - concentration scatter is independent of the statistical noise set by the finite number of source galaxies , in principle the total uncertainty can be obtained by adding the two uncertainties in quadrature . in the current study",
    ", we omit the procedure because the total error budget is dominated by the statistical errors .",
    "the resulting @xmath23 values for the northern and southern halos are @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively ( table 3 ) .",
    "this shows that rx  j0603.3 + 4214  consists of two subclusters with an approximate mass ratio of 3:1 . in merging clusters , estimation of the total mass of the entire system ( e.g. , @xmath23 when the two halos are combined ) by adding the masses of the two halos is ambiguous because the result certainly depends on the choice of the system center .",
    "if we choose the geometric mean of the two halos as the center , the total mass of the rx  j0603.3 + 4214  system becomes @xmath150 ; we determined the value @xmath24 numerically by overlapping the two halos in 3d .",
    "this mass nicely agrees with the value @xmath151 obtained from the tangential shear fitting discussed in [ section_1d ] ( i.e. , assuming a single halo ) .",
    "normally , this level of agreement should be considered surprising in merging clusters . however , because the southern cluster s contribution to the total mass is small ( @xmath152 ) , this agreement is not totally unexpected in rx  j0603.3 + 4214 .",
    "we summarize the mass estimation results in table 3 .",
    "ccc north & @xmath153 & @xmath154 + south & @xmath155 & @xmath156 + total ( two - component)@xmath157 & - & @xmath158 + total ( one - component)@xmath15 & 3.17@xmath1590.04 & @xmath160",
    "because we make an approximation that the mass of rx  j0603.3 + 4214  is dominated by the two halos associated with the two x - ray peaks , it is useful to examine the validity of the assumption by an independent method .",
    "we employ aperture mass densitometry , which allows us to estimate total projected masses within a given aperture without any assumption on the number of halos and their profiles .",
    "we will compare this projected mass from aperture mass densitometry with the results from our two halo model by projecting the 3d nfw mass distribution onto the plane of sky .",
    "aperture mass densitometry ( fahlman et al . 1994 ; clowe et al . 2000 ) is computed through the following equation : @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the azimuthal average of tangential shears , @xmath163 is the aperture radius , and @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the inner and the outer radii of the annulus , respectively .",
    "@xmath166 provides a density contrast of the region inside @xmath167 with respect to the control annulus @xmath168 .",
    "we choose @xmath169 and @xmath170 for the control annulus .",
    "projecting our nfw fitting results , we estimate the density within this annulus to be @xmath171 .",
    "because the control annulus radius is large and the density there is small , the impact of adopting the nfw results on the aperture mass densitometry becomes negligible .",
    "the input to the equation of the densitometry is a shear @xmath172 , not a reduced shear @xmath173 .",
    "therefore , we need to determine the aperture mass using the relation @xmath174 .",
    "we find that the density converges after three or four iterations .",
    "the resulting aperture mass is displayed in figure  [ fig_aperture_mass ] .",
    "also displayed in figure  [ fig_aperture_mass ] is the aperture mass estimated by projecting the nfw fitting results above . in order to obtain this estimation , we first projected each nfw profile along the line - of - sight direction and summed the two - halo results .",
    "the aperture mass density masses are within the 1@xmath135 upper limits of the nfw masses , which may hint at the possibility that the two - halo representation may not be a perfect choice . however , because the 1@xmath135 error bars from both methods overlap , we argue that the difference should not be considered statistically significant .",
    "range of statistical uncertainties .",
    "the two results are consistent with each other , and we conclude that no significant mass is excluded by modeling rx  j0603.3 + 4214  with two nfw profiles . , width=321 ]      a diffuse hot plasma within a cluster is well traced by x - ray emission because the emissivity is in general proportional to the plasma density squared ( given the same plasma temperature ) .",
    "since the plasma consists of charged particles subject to ram pressure , the x - ray morphology of merging clusters reveals critical information that can not be probed otherwise .",
    "here we compare the x - ray morphology of rx  j0603.3 + 4214  with the weak - lensing mass distribution and discuss the implication in the context of the merging scenario responsible for the observed  toothbrush \" radio relic .",
    "rx  j0603.3 + 4214  has been observed with both _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra_. the 82  ks _ xmm - newton _ data were studied by ogrean et al .",

    "ogrean et al . (",
    "2013 ) showed that the intracluster medium of rx  j0603.3 + 4214  is dominated by two components , which is confirmed by the chandra study of van weeren et al .",
    "in addition , a few new remarkable features are revealed in the high - resolution chandra observation .",

    "the two mach numbers derived by both density and temperature jumps are consistent ( @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively ) .",
    "second , the high - resolution chandra data show that the southern x - ray component has a triangular  bullet \"- like shape . according to their further temperature analysis , the density jump at the southern edge of the bullet indicates a cold front .    the comparison of these x - ray findings with the current weak - lensing results provides a consistent picture regarding the merging scenario of rx  j0603.3 + 4214 .",
    "we display the comparison in figure  [ fig_massoverxray ] , where we illustrate our hypothesized merger axis . despite the somewhat complex galaxy distribution",
    ", the x - ray and weak - lensing results suggest that the dominant merger may be approximated by a north - south collision of two components",
    ". we find offsets between x - ray and mass peaks .",
    "the northern mass peak is offset toward the northwest with respect to the corresponding x - ray peak by @xmath178 whereas the the southern mass peak is offset to the south by @xmath6 .",
    "similar to the bullet cluster , the direction of the offsets favors a scenario wherein the two components passed through each other and are still separating .",
    "our weak - lensing analysis shows that the northern component is more massive than the southern component by a factor of three .",
    "we believe that this mass inequality is consistent with the offset inequality , since the less massive southern component should experience more ram pressure .",
    "another supporting evidence for this mass inequality is the location of the  toothbrush \"- relic .",
    "the simulation by van weeren et al . ( 2011 ) predicts that two radio - relics are generated in a two - body encounter and travel along the merger axis with the larger relic associated with the more massive halo .",
    "the observation that the @xmath179mpc  toothbrush \"- relic is located near the northern edge of rx  j0603.3 + 4214   is consistent with the northern component being more massive in our weak - lensing analysis .",
    "the same trend has been observed in our weak - lensing study of the  sausage \" cluster ciza  j2242.8 + 5301  ( jee et al .",
    "2015 ) and zwcl0008.8 + 5215 ( n. golovich et al . in prep .",
    "the study of zwcl0008.8 + 5215 shows that the x - ray emission of the less massive system appears as a clear  bullet \"- like feature , similar to the  bullet \" cluster ( clowe et al .",
    "2006 ) , whereas the larger radio relic is found near the edge of the more massive system .",
    "the exact physical mechanism is unknown as to the question  why does the larger radio relic occur on the higher mass side ? \" on the other hand , x - ray observations show that distinct shock features such as density discontinuities , temperature jumps , etc . , are more prominent on the lower - mass side unlike radio relics , which are also believed to trace the location of shock fronts .",
    "some may argue that the above mass inequality argument may be challenged by the x - ray luminosity of the southern peak being much higher .",
    "needless to say , in general x - ray luminosity is positively correlated with mass . however , in active merging clusters , it is natural to suspect that this correlation between mass and x - ray luminosity can temporarily be altered for many reasons ( e.g. , randall et al . 2002 ; skillman et al . 2013 ) . for example , a cool core ( associated with a lower - mass component ) can survive a head - on collision , whereas a hot core ( associated with a higher - mass component ) can severely be disrupted after a core pass - through .",
    "the deep chandra x - ray image of the  el gordo \" cluster at @xmath180 is a good example .",
    "the weak - lensing study shows that the system is composed of two halos with a 2:1 mass ratio , whereas only the cool core associated with the less massive system ( south ) is clearly visible in x - ray ( jee et al .",

    "here we discuss some of the puzzling issues of rx  j0603.3 + 4214  that future hydrodynamic simulations should address .",
    "first , we believe that the extremely high icm temperature of rx  j0603.3 + 4214  deserves our attention .",
    "van weeren et al .",
    "( 2015 ) constrain the temperatures of the northern and southern x - ray peaks to be @xmath182 kev and @xmath183 kev , respectively . these temperatures",
    "are substantially higher than what our weak - lensing masses imply _ if _ we neglect nonthermal energy injection into icm . with the assumption of the isothermal @xmath56 model with @xmath184 kpc and @xmath185 ,",
    "the weak - lensing masses are converted to @xmath186 kev and @xmath187 kev for the northern and southern halos , respectively .",
    "even when we treat rx  j0603.3 + 4214   as a single halo with @xmath188 ( i.e. , the sum of the two halos using the values in table 3 ) , the implied temperature ( again with an isothermal @xmath56 model ) becomes only @xmath189 kev , significantly smaller than the global x - ray temperature @xmath190 kev .",
    "although this discrepancy may not be considered surprising , given the common understanding that x - ray temperatures of merging clusters are biased indicators of the cluster masses , the level of discrepancy that we witness in rx  j0603.3 + 4214   is somewhat extreme when we consider results for other clusters in the literature .",

    "second , although we argue that the two subclusters of rx  j0603.3 + 4214   played the dominant roles in creating the current observational features such as the galaxy - mass - relic alignments , the offsets between mass / galaxy and x - ray peaks , etc . , the long asymmetrically linear feature of the ",

    "third , the implied collision velocity is very high . the high polarization fraction @xmath191% ( van weeren et al .",
    "2012 ) suggests that the merger may be happening in the plane of the sky . according to our redshift analysis ( w. dawson et al . in prep ) , the line - of - sight velocity difference between the northern and southern subclusters is @xmath192 km  s@xmath37 .",

    "our weak - lensing study provides a high - resolution map of the cluster dark matter , which helps us to constrain the merging scenario responsible for the  toothbrush \" relic .",
    "we find that although the cluster substructure is more complicated than that of ciza  j2242.8 + 5301 , the global mass distribution can be approximated by a bimodal distribution with a 3:1 mass ratio .",

    "the two mass peaks , two x - ray peaks , two luminosity peaks , and the  brush \" of the  toothbrush \" relic are collinear , which strongly suggests that the violent merger responsible for the giant radio relic was mainly derived by the collision of the two components . however , the long  handle \" relic extended northeast from the  brush \" indicates that a third ( or more ) component might have been involved in this merger .",
    "it is interesting that our weak - lensing mass reconstruction reveals a mass clump southwest of the northern mass peak .",
    "we find that a galaxy luminosity peak coincides with this mass overdensity .",

    "<S> the galaxy cluster rx  j0603.3 + 4214   at @xmath0 is one of the rarest clusters boasting an extremely large ( @xmath1  mpc ) radio relic . because of the remarkable morphology of the relic </S>",
    "<S> , the cluster is nicknamed the  toothbrush cluster \" . </S>",
    "<S> although the cluster s underlying mass distribution is one of the critical pieces of information needed to reconstruct the merger scenario responsible for the puzzling radio relic morphology , its proximity to the galactic plane @xmath2 has imposed significant observational challenges . </S>",
    "<S> we present a high - resolution weak - lensing study of the cluster with subaru / suprime cam and _ hubble space telescope _ imaging data . </S>",
    "<S> our mass reconstruction reveals that the cluster is composed of complicated dark matter substructures closely tracing the galaxy distribution , in contrast , however , with the relatively simple binary x - ray morphology . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we find that the cluster mass is still dominated by the two most massive clumps aligned north - south with a @xmath33:1 mass ratio ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the northern and southern clumps , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the southern mass peak is @xmath6 offset toward the south with respect to the corresponding x - ray peak , which has a  bullet \"- like morphology pointing south . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the current weak - lensing result with the x - ray , galaxy , and radio relic suggests that perhaps the dominant mechanism responsible for the observed relic may be a high - speed collision of the two most massive subclusters , although the peculiarity of the morphology necessitates involvement of additional subclusters . </S>",
    "<S> careful numerical simulations should follow in order to obtain more complete understanding of the merger scenario utilizing all existing observations . </S>"
