    "the estimation of unobserved states of a continuous stochastic dynamical system from noisy discrete observations is of central importance to solve diverse scientific and technological problems .",
    "the major contribution to the solution of this estimation problem is due to kalman and bucy @xcite , who provided a sequential and computationally efficient solution to the optimal filtering and prediction problem for linear state space models with additive noise .",
    "however , the optimal estimation of nonlinear state space models is still a subject of active researches .",
    "typically , the solution of optimal filtering problems involves the resolution of evolution equations for conditional probabilistic densities , moments or modes , which in general have explicit solutions in few particular cases .",
    "therefore , a variety approximations have been developed .",
    "examples of such approximate nonlinear filters are the classical ones as the extended kalman , the iterated extended kalman , the gaussian and the modified gaussian filters @xcite ; and other relatively recents as the local linearization @xcite , the projection @xcite and the particle filters @xcite methods .    in a variety of practical situations ,",
    "the solution of the general optimal filtering problem is dispensable since the solution provided by a suboptimal filter is satisfactory .",
    "this is the case of the signal filtering and detection problems , the system stabilization , and the parameter estimation of nonlinear systems , among others .",
    "prominent examples of suboptimal filters are the linear , the quadratic and the polynomial one , which have been widely used for the estimation of the state of both , continuous - continuous @xcite and discrete - discrete @xcite models . in the case of continuous - discrete models , exact expressions for linear minimum variance filter ( lmv ) have also been derived @xcite , but they are restricted to linear models . for nonlinear models , this kind of suboptimal filter has in general no exact solution since the first two conditional moments of the state equation has no explicit solution .",
    "therefore , adequate approximations are required in this situation as well .    in this paper ,",
    "approximate lmv filters for nonlinear continuous - discrete state space models are introduced .",
    "the filters are obtained by means of a recursive approximation to the predictions for the first two moments of the state equation .",
    "it is shown that the approximate filters converge to the exact lmv filter when the error between the predictions and their approximations decreases .",
    "based on the well - known local linear approximations for the state equation , the order-@xmath0 local linearization filters are presented as a particular instance . their convergence , practical algorithms and performance in simulations are also considered in detail .",
    "the simulations show that these local linearization filters provide accurate and computationally efficient estimation of the unobserved states of the stochastic systems given a reduced number of partial and noisy observations , which is a typical situation in practical control engineering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , basic notations and results on lmv filters , local linear approximations and local linearization filters",
    "are presented . the general class of approximate lmv filters is introduced in section 3 and its convergence",
    "is stated . in section 4 ,",

    "undoubtedly , this imposes undesirable restrictions to the time distance between observations that can not be accomplished in many practical situations .",
    "this drawback can be overcome by means of the particle filter introduced in @xcite , but at expense of a very high computation cost .",
    "note that this filter performs , by means of intensive simulations , an estimation of the whole probabilistic distribution of the processes @xmath30 solution of ( [ ss1 ] ) from which the first two conditional moments of @xmath30 can then be computed . obviously , this general solution to the filtering problem is not practical when an expedited computation of the lmv filter ( [ lmvf1])-([lmvf5 ] ) is required , which is typically demanded in many applications .",
    "for example , the lmv filter and its approximations are a key component of the innovation method for the parameter estimation of diffusion processes from a time series of partial and noisy observations @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper , approximate linear minimum variance ( lmv ) filters for continuous - discrete state space models are introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the filters are obtained by means of a recursive approximation to the predictions for the first two moments of the state equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the approximate filters converge to the exact lmv filter when the error between the predictions and their approximations decreases . </S>",
    "<S> as particular instance , the order-@xmath0 local linearization filters are presented and expounded in detail . </S>",
    "<S> practical algorithms are also provided and their performance in simulation is illustrated with various examples . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed filters are intended for the recurrent practical situation where a nonlinear stochastic system should be identified from a reduced number of partial and noisy observations distant in time . </S>"
