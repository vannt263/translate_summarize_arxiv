    "one of the paradigmatic innovations of quantum information theory is to consider entanglement not only as an apparently paradoxical feature of distributed quantum systems , but rather as a physical resource for quantum information processing tasks .",
    "this resource point of view naturally raises the question , how to quantify the entanglement",
    ".    for pure bipartite quantum states there exists , under reasonable assumptions , a unique measure of entanglement ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which can in addition easily be calculated . for mixed states ,",
    "however , there is a large variety of inequivalent entanglement measures , which are either extremely hard to calculate , or do not satisfy some of the `` reasonable assumptions '' .",
    "two of these measures , however , stand out due to there physical meaning : the _ entanglement cost _ @xmath2 , and the _ distillable entanglement _ @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath2 is the amount of pure state entanglement asymptotically needed in order to prepare a given mixed state , whereas the distillable entanglement is the amount of pure state entanglement that can asymptotically be extracted from it ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . both , preparation and distillation process , are assumed to use only local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the question to what extent entanglement distillation is an ( ir-)reversible operation",
    ". we will give a complete characterization of the reversibility properties of the entire set of non - trivial distillable mixed states for which the ( entanglement assisted ) distillable entanglement is known so far .",
    "it was recently proven that there are indeed examples , for which @xmath3 is strictly smaller than @xmath2 , hence entanglement distillation is not reversible in general @xcite .",
    "however , it is yet unclear , whether this is an exceptional feature of specific quantum states , or a generic property of all mixed states .",
    "the particular variational and asymptotic nature of @xmath2 and @xmath3 makes this an intrinsically hard problem , even if we have not to calculate both measures explicitly .",
    "although a general answer to this question seems to be out of reach at the moment , we are able to completely classify a @xmath4 parameter family of non - trivial mixed states in arbitrary hilbert space dimensions @xmath1 with respect to their reversibility properties .    for the considered class of states",
    ", irreversibility turns out to be generic .",
    "this remains true even if the distillation process is catalytically assisted by pure state entanglement and the class of allowed distillation operations is considerably enlarged .",
    "moreover , all the reversible cases correspond to pure states which are hidden in a mixture , that can , however , be broken up by means of local operations .",
    "surprisingly , the equality @xmath5 is for the states under consideration essentially equivalent to a discrete entropic uncertainty relation , such that the cases of reversibility are completely characterized by vectors of minimal uncertainty .",
    "the appendix shows how to explicitly calculate the amount of _ undistillable entanglement _",
    "@xmath6 for some examples .    before specifying and proving these results",
    ", we will begin with providing some prerequisites and recalling recent results .",
    "let @xmath7 with @xmath8 be an orthonormal basis of maximally entangled states in @xmath9 , given by @xmath10where addition inside the ket is modulo @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we will in the following consider states of the form @xmath13 which form a @xmath4 parameter family of rank deficient states , characterized by the probability vector @xmath14 . note that we could equivalently choose @xmath15 with arbitrary integers @xmath16 , or any other set of states , which differs from @xmath17 only by the choice of local bases .",
    "it is readily verified that @xmath18 is entangled unless @xmath19 ( cf.@xcite ) . like all states , which are diagonal with respect to the basis @xmath7 , every state @xmath18 commutes with any element of the abelian symmetry group @xmath20 @xcite . in particular , @xmath18 is invariant under the locc twirl operation @xmath21 , which maps any state @xmath22 onto a symmetric state @xmath23 , which is diagonal with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "we will in the following make extensive use of the symmetry properties of @xmath18 and the particular form of @xmath24 .      for pure bipartite states there exists , under reasonable assumptions , a unique measure of entanglement : the von neumann entropy of the reduced state @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the shannon entropy of the spectrum @xmath27 of @xmath22 . for simplicity we will use the same notation for the shannon and von neumann entropy , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "every pure state @xmath29 can by means of locc operations be transformed into maximally entangled states @xmath30 in an asymptotically reversible manner , such that the number of maximally entangled states per copy of @xmath29 is given by @xmath31 .",
    "that is , we can locally transform @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where @xmath30 is any maximally entangled two qubit state .    for a mixed state @xmath22 the amount of pure state entanglement which is asymptotically required for the preparation of @xmath22 and the amount that can be extracted from it , need not be the same .",
    "however , it is from a physical point of view obvious , that the entanglement cost @xmath2 is in general larger than or equal to the distillable entanglement @xmath3 , where @xmath3 and @xmath2 are the asymptotically optimal rates in @xmath34 in fact , it was proven in @xcite , that there are undistillable ( @xmath35 ) as well as distillable @xmath36 cases , for which @xmath37 , such that there is some _ undistillable entanglement _ contained in the state , which makes the distillation process irreversible .",
    "one of these examples investigated in @xcite is in fact @xmath18 for the case @xmath38 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that @xmath39 is the asymptotic _ entanglement of formation _",
    "@xmath40 , where the infimum is taken over all pure state decompositions @xmath41 . for symmetric states like @xmath18 this computation",
    "can be simplified @xcite , such that @xmath42 is the convex hull of the function @xmath43 moreover , it was shown in @xcite that the distillable entanglement for states of the form @xmath18 is bounded from above by @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath45 is the _ ppt entanglement assisted _ distillable entanglement .",
    "that is , the class of allowed operations leading to the optimal rate @xmath45 is enlarged from locc to maps preserving the positivity of the partial transpose ( ppt ) @xcite , and the process is in addition assisted by loaned pure - state entanglement .",
    "the well known heisenberg uncertainty relation states that a function and its fourier transform can not both be highly concentrated .",
    "analogous relations can also be formulated for the case of a finite dimensional vector @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and its discrete fourier transform @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "it is known , for instance from classical signal recovery @xcite that @xmath50 is the number of non - zero components of @xmath51 .",
    "equality in eq.([donohostark ] ) is attained iff @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 are arbitrary integers , @xmath54 is any proportionality constant and @xmath55 is a factor of @xmath11 , such that @xmath56 .    instead of quantifying the `` concentration '' of @xmath51 and @xmath48 by their supports , we could as well use the entropy , and it was proven in @xcite , that if @xmath51 is normalized , then @xmath57 the case of equality in eq.([maassen ] ) was discussed in @xcite , where it was shown that in this case all non - zero @xmath58 as well as all @xmath59 have to have the same moduli , such that eq.([maassen ] ) reduces to eq.([donohostark ] ) and the complete set of minimal uncertainty vectors is again given by eq.([dsequality ] ) .",
    "we will discuss in the following section , how the entropic uncertainty inequality is for the set of states @xmath18 related to the irreversibility of entanglement distillation .",
    "our aim is to give a complete characterization of the cases of equality in @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we have therefore to find a sufficiently close estimate for the entanglement cost , which is considerably simplified by the symmetry properties of @xmath18 .",
    "first , we can utilize a result of @xcite in order to show that @xmath62 : if there is an isometry @xmath63 , which is such that @xmath64 is an _ entanglement breaking _ map , then @xmath65 holds for every @xmath22 with support in @xmath66 .",
    "the general form @xcite of an entanglement breaking map , which is such that @xmath67 `` breaks '' the entanglement of every input state , is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a povm ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 is a set of density operators .",
    "let us choose @xmath72 , such that @xmath18 is clearly in the support of @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath73 , with @xmath74 has the required property , and hence , the entanglement cost is indeed equal to the entanglement of formation @xcite .    utilizing that @xmath18 has a symmetry group @xmath75 of local unitaries , we can furthermore simplify the calculation of @xmath76 , such that we have the chain of ( in-)equalities : @xmath77 now note that @xmath78 is strictly smaller than @xmath79 only on affine pieces .",
    "since @xmath80 is , however , strictly convex , i.e. , nowhere affine , @xmath81 implies that also @xmath82 .",
    "we can therefore disregard taking the convex hull , since it does not alter the set of states for which equality is obtained .    in order to specify the function @xmath83",
    "we need first a characterization of pure states @xmath29 , which are mapped onto @xmath18 by the twirl operation @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath85 preserves every expectation value with respect to any element of @xmath7 , and the latter form an orthonormal basis in hilbert space , we have that @xmath29 has to be of the form latexmath:[\\[\\label{varphic }     calculation shows then , that the entanglement of @xmath29 is given by @xmath87 , where @xmath48 is the discrete fourier transform of @xmath51 .    combining all these observations we obtain that cases of equality in @xmath61 are exactly given by the minimal uncertainty vectors for the discrete entropic uncertainty relation , i.e. , @xmath88where @xmath89 .",
    "due to eq.([dsequality ] ) the vectors of minimal uncertainty correspond to a discrete set of states @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , the irreversibility of the process of entanglement distillation is generic even in the case where the distillation process is catalytically assisted by pure entangled states and the allowed operations are ppt preserving rather than locc .",
    "moreover , in prime dimensions eq.([dsequality ] ) gives only rise to trivial solutions corresponding to pure states , so that in this case every mixed state @xmath18 contains some _",
    "undistillable entanglement_.    we will in the following section have a closer look at the reversible cases appearing in non - prime dimensions .",
    "it is not difficult to see , that there are entangled mixed states for which the distillation and preparation processes are asymptotically reversible .",
    "a simple example are pure states `` hidden '' in a mixture , which can , however , be broken up by means of locc operations without destroying entanglement .",
    "the simple idea is to add a hilbert space @xmath90 , which contains a locally measurable _ tag _",
    "@xmath91 for every entangled state @xmath92 appearing in the mixture : @xmath93 may either correspond to one or to both parties . in the latter case they have to be products such that they do not contain any entanglement .",
    "it is then easy to see , that @xmath94 , since the pure state @xmath95 can by construction be identified with unit efficiency by local measurements on @xmath90 . as states of the form @xmath96 , which have already appeared in @xcite ,",
    "are in this sense essentially ( hidden ) pure states , we will call them _ quasi - pure_.    let us now turn to the case @xmath97 again . for simplicity",
    "we will change the local bases and choose @xmath98 now .",
    "eq.([dsequality ] ) tells us that reversibility in dimension @xmath99 occurs only if the state is up to local unitaries of the form @xmath18 with @xmath100 .",
    "writing down this state leads after some simple substitutions to @xmath101where the upper indices label the dimension of the respective states .",
    "the tensor product in eq.([tensorschummel ] ) corresponds to a split of the form @xmath102 rather than to an @xmath103 split . as pointed out in sec.[states ] the second part in eq.([tensorschummel ] ) is , however , a separable state , such that each reversible @xmath18 corresponds to the trivial case of a quasi - pure state for which all @xmath95 are the same .",
    "it is evident that in these cases @xmath104 , since the states are already distilled after discarding the separable part .",
    "we have discussed the irreversibility of entanglement distillation for the entire set of non - trivial distillable mixed states for which the ( entanglement assisted ) distillable entanglement is known so far .",
    "the result is supporting evidence for the conjecture that irreversibility in the distillation process is a generic property of mixed states . as a byproduct we rederived the discrete entropic uncertainty relation ( for complementary observables ) from the simple statement that",
    "entanglement is non - increasing under locc operations . within the considered set of states",
    "reversible cases are thus characterized by minimal uncertainty vectors , which in turn were shown to correspond to _ quasi - pure states_.",
    "mmw is grateful to h. maassen for valuable comments on entropic uncertainty relations .",
    "funding by the european union project equip ( contract ist-1999 - 11053 ) and financial support from the dfg ( bonn ) is gratefully acknowledged .      here",
    ", we will show how to explicitly calculate the amount of _ undistillable entanglement _ for some states @xmath18 .",
    "we can in particular circumvent the calculation of the infimum in eq.([epsilon ] ) , if all the eigenvalues @xmath105 except one are equal :    the entanglement of formation of the state @xmath106 with @xmath107 is equal to the entanglement of formation of an isotropic state @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "the entanglement of the latter was calculated in @xcite .",
    "this result is implied by the general extension method for isotropic states discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will , however , give here a simpler proof , that is based on the fact that for states diagonal w.r.t .",
    "@xmath7 as well as for isotropic states there exist a twirl operation @xmath85 resp .",
    "@xmath110 , which is entanglement non - increasing as it is a locc operation .",
    "since @xmath111 it follows that @xmath112 now , consider the pure states giving rise to the minimum in the optimization problem of @xmath79 for isotropic states @xcite : @xmath113 by twirling over the discrete group g , i.e. , @xmath114 we get @xmath115 , and thus @xmath116 since the convex hull of @xmath79 is the largest convex function below @xmath79 and @xmath117 is a convex function , we have indeed @xmath118 .",
