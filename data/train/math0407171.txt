    "initial conditions_. fomin and zelevinsky @xcite were able to show that for initial conditions satisfying some basic requirements , the rational functions generated by the cube recurrence are in fact laurent polynomials in the @xmath3 .",
    "the introduction of groves by carroll and speyer @xcite gave a combinatorial proof of the surprising fact that each term of these polynomials has coefficient + 1 .",
    "the main results in this paper only apply to the family of groves on _ standard initial conditions _ as described in section [ sec : init ] .    before getting into the details of groves ,",
    "let us first describe the motivation for this paper : random domino tilings of large aztec diamonds .",
    "aztec diamond _ of order @xmath4 consists of the union of all unit squares with integer vertices contained in the planar region @xmath5 .",
    "a _ domino tiling _ of an aztec diamond is an arrangement of @xmath6 rectangles , or _",
    "dominoes _ , that cover the diamond without any overlapping .",
    "a random domino tiling of a large aztec diamond consists of two qualitatively different regions . , though other probability distributions may be considered as well .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "as seen in the random tiling in figure [ fig : aztec ] , the dominoes in the corners of the diamond are _ frozen _ in a brickwork pattern , whereas the dominoes in the interior have a more random , _ temperate _ behavior .",
    "it was shown in @xcite and @xcite that asymptotically , the boundary between the frozen and temperate regions in a random tiling is given by the circle inscribed in the aztec diamond .",
    "since everything outside the circle is expected to be frozen , it is referred to as the _ arctic _ circle .",
    "[ h ]    in this paper we shall see that groves on standard initial conditions exhibit a very similar behavior . a grove , however , is not a type of tiling .",
    "as the name may suggest , a grove is in fact a collection of trees . from our point of view",
    ", groves are spanning forests on a finite triangular lattice satisfying certain connectivity conditions on the boundary .",
    "we will show that outside of the circle inscribed in the triangle , the trees of a large random grove line up uniformly .    despite their superficial differences , groves and random domino tilings of aztec diamonds",
    "are linked by more than their asymptotic behavior .",
    "in fact it seems that their asymptotic behavior is similar _ because _ they share a deeper link .",
    "the paper of carroll and speyer @xcite establishes that groves are encoded in the terms of a laurent polynomial given by the cube recurrence .",
    "there is a more general form of the cube recurrence : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are constants . if @xmath9 we have the original form of the cube recurrence from whence come groves .",
    "if @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we have ( after re - indexing ) , the _ octahedron recurrence _ :",
    "@xmath12 with which we may encode tilings of aztec diamonds . in section [ sec : aztec ] , we will show how the polynomial @xmath13 yields all tilings of an aztec diamond of order @xmath4 and we will describe the role that this recurrence plays in the large scale behavior of such tilings .",
    "while the octahedron recurrence is important to us , it has not been extant in the study of tilings of aztec diamonds in the past .",
    "rather , a local move called _ domino shuffling _ has been used .",
    "domino shuffling was introduced in @xcite and is generalized in @xcite .",
    "it provides a method for generating tilings of successively larger aztec diamonds uniformly at random , and has been at least implicit in all probabilistic analysis done to date .",
    "section [ sec : shuf ] will introduce an analogous local move for groves that we call _ grove shuffling_. like domino shuffling , it will be key to our analysis .    for each of the two models discussed we have a global perspective and a local perspective .",
    "laurent polynomials tell the global story : all groves are encapsulated in @xmath14 ( from the cube recurrence ) , all tilings in @xmath13 ( from the octahedron recurrence ) .",
    "a specified shuffling algorithm tells the local story . in this paper",
    "we combine these two points of view to build generating functions ( for tilings of aztec diamonds as well as for groves ) , with which we can study asymptotic behavior .",
    "[ h ]    the standard initial conditions of order @xmath4 specify a vertex set @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we draw its projection onto the plane @xmath20 as shown in figure [ fig : inits1 ] for the case @xmath21 .",
    "one way to generate all groves of order @xmath4 is to set @xmath1 for all @xmath22 , and compute @xmath14 .",
    "each term in the resulting laurent polynomial defines a grove as follows .",
    "let @xmath23 be the graph on the vertex set @xmath24 where vertex @xmath25 has as its neighbors the vertices @xmath26 .",
    "pictorially , edges of @xmath23 connect vertices that lie diagonally across a rhombus . in figure [",

    "we have the following    the _ grove _ @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 is the unique subgraph of @xmath23 containing no crossing edges such that vertex @xmath25 in @xmath24 has exactly @xmath32 incident edges .",
    "the uniqueness of the grove determined by each monomial is a consequence of theorem 3 in @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath14 on @xmath33 is @xmath34 and the corresponding groves are shown in figure [ fig : grove1 ] .",
    "[ h ]    for a more interesting example , one term of @xmath14 on @xmath35 is @xmath36 its corresponding grove , @xmath30 , is shown in figure [ fig : grove4pic ] .",
    "we can observe some connectivity properties of this grove that in fact hold for all groves .",
    "every vertex on the boundary of @xmath37 ( where cubes have been pushed down ) is connected to another vertex on the boundary of @xmath37 if and only if those vertices are equidistant to the nearest corner ( i.e. where two coordinates are zero ) of the grove .",
    "groves are acyclic  every connected component of a grove is a tree .",
    "lastly , each grove spans @xmath24 .",
    "these connectivity properties are in fact what distinguish groves from arbitrary subgraphs of @xmath23 , and so give us a combinatorial definition of groves .",

    "long edges connect flat vertices to flat vertices , and short edges connect up vertices to down vertices .",
    "even vertices are only connected to even even vertices and odd vertices are only connected to odd vertices .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that every vertex in @xmath44 has degree 2 and only uses its short edges . as a result ,",
    "there are only finitely many long edges , and these determine the grove .",
    "this observation leads to a more convenient way of looking at groves .",
    "we begin by constructing a modified form of the cube recurrence .",
    "let @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 be _ long edge variables _ where @xmath48 is fixed .",
    "the variable @xmath45 is the label for the edge between vertices @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath46 is the label for the edge between @xmath50 and @xmath25 , and @xmath47 is the label for the edge between @xmath25 and @xmath49 . we write a modified form of the cube recurrence as follows : @xmath51 as we said , the long edges determine the grove , so rather than setting @xmath1 for @xmath22 , we set @xmath52 for @xmath22 . then @xmath14 is simply a polynomial in the edge variables @xmath53 , where the variables appear with exponent @xmath54 or 0 , depending on whether the corresponding long edge is present or not .",
    "each term describes a unique grove , and we still produce every grove .",
    "this form of the cube recurrence is called the _ edge variables version_.    taking inspiration from the edge variables version of the cube recurrence , we can draw a simpler picture of our groves by ignoring all short edges and all of the vertices incident with them .",
    "in other words , specify a subset of the standard initial conditions of order @xmath4 , called the _ simplified initial conditions _ : @xmath55 .",
    "the simplified initial conditions are just all of the flat vertices .",
    "we now represent our groves as graphs on this vertex set  a triangular lattice shown in figure [ fig : simp ] .",
    "also in figure [ fig : simp ] we see the same grove as in figure [ fig : grove4pic ] , but with only the long edges included . in terms of edge variables ,",
    "this grove is given by @xmath56    [ h ]   compared to @xmath35 .",
    "on the right : a standard grove and its corresponding simplified grove.,title=\"fig : \" ]    another modification of the cube recurrence that we shall like to use is the _ edge - and - face variables version_. in the original version of the cube recurrence , the variables @xmath3 such that @xmath40 were vertex variables . in the simplified picture ,",
    "we call them the _ face variables _ of order @xmath4 , for reasons that will become clear . rather than setting @xmath57 for all @xmath25 in @xmath24 ,",
    "we give the face variables their formal weights .",
    "that is , we set @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "generating @xmath14 using these initial conditions , we get a laurent polynomial in the edge and face variables .",
    "the vertices of the simplified initial conditions can be seen as forming @xmath61 downward - pointing equilateral triangles , each with top - left vertex @xmath49 , top - right vertex @xmath50 , and bottom vertex @xmath25 .",
    "the face variables then correspond to each of these downward - pointing triangles . the triangle with @xmath25 as its bottom vertex has face variable @xmath62 .",
    "the exponent of the face variable is @xmath63 or @xmath64 , corresponding to whether the downward - pointing triangle has , respectively , two , one , or zero edges present .",
    "there ca nt be three edges , since that would introduce a cycle and we would no longer have a forest . although the face variables do nt tell us anything new about a particular grove , they will be useful later in deriving probabilities of edges being present in random groves .",
    "we have given one definition for what groves are , and how they may be generated .",
    "the methods and notation introduced in the previous section will be very helpful for later proofs .",
    "however , there is another tool we will like to use ; an algorithm called _ grove shuffling _ ( or _ cube - popping _ as in @xcite ) .",
    "grove shuffling not only gives a purely combinatorial definition of groves , but also a method for generating groves of order @xmath4 uniformly at random .",
    "its inspiration comes from _ domino shuffling _ , due to elkies , kuperberg , larsen , and propp @xcite .",
    "the use to which we put grove shuffling is directly motivated by james propp and his paper @xcite . for proof that grove shuffling does indeed give rise to the same objects as the terms of the laurent polynomials given by the cube recurrence , see carroll and speyer @xcite . here",
    "we will only include a description of the algorithm .",
    "[ h ]     grove shuffling can be thought of as a local move on the downward - pointing triangles of a simplified grove according to whether a triangle has zero , one , or two edges present .",
    "see figure [ fig : shuf ] .",
    "let @xmath65 be a generic downward - pointing triangle with possible edges @xmath66 as shown , and let @xmath67 be an upward - pointing triangle , concentric with @xmath65 , with possible edges @xmath68 as shown .",
    "there are three configurations of @xmath65 with two edges : @xmath69 .",
    "grove shuffling takes each of these triangles and replaces them with an upward - pointing triangle @xmath67 having none of its possible edges present .",
    "there are three configurations of @xmath65 with exactly one edge : @xmath70 .",
    "each of these is replaced by the upward - pointing triangle @xmath67 with only the parallel edge : @xmath68 , respectively present .",
    "lastly , there is one configuration of @xmath65 with none of its possible edges present .",
    "this triangle is replaced with the upward - pointing triangle @xmath67 containing any two of its three possible edges : @xmath71 , chosen randomly with probability 1/3 .",
    "this last step is the only random part of the algorithm .",
    "after we have turned every downward - pointing triangle into an upward - pointing triangle , we add three new vertices to the corners of the grove so that we may shuffle again .",
    "for an example of grove shuffling , see figure [ fig : shufexamp ] .",
    "[ h ]     there is a unique grove of order 1 .",
    "it has one downward - pointing triangle with zero edges .",
    "we now give a purely combinatorial description of simplified groves on standard initial conditions of order @xmath4 : they are all the possible results of @xmath72 iterations of grove shuffling , beginning with the grove of order 1 . from looking at the cube recurrence , it is not hard to show that there are @xmath73 groves of order @xmath4 .",
    "we can now make the following claim about grove shuffling .",
    "beginning with the unique grove of order one , any grove of order @xmath4 will be generated after @xmath72 iterations of grove shuffling with probability @xmath74 .",
    "in other words , grove shuffling can be used to generate groves uniformly at random .",
    "clearly the statement holds for @xmath4=2 .",
    "suppose that the claim holds for some @xmath75 .",
    "we would like to know the probability of an arbitrary grove of order @xmath76 being generated .",
    "fix such a grove and call it @xmath77 .",
    "only a certain subset of the groves of order @xmath78 can be shuffled to become @xmath77 .",
    "call this set the shuffling pre - image of @xmath77 , denoted @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 be the number of downward - pointing triangles in @xmath82 with zero edges , let @xmath83 be the number with exactly one edge , and @xmath84 be the number of downward - pointing triangles with two edges .    from the rules of grove shuffling",
    ", we see that the order of @xmath79 is @xmath85 .",
    "each pre - image is obtained by making different choices of the the two edges appearing in each of the @xmath84 downward - pointing triangles of @xmath82 .",
    "so since we have supposed the probability of generating a particular grove of order @xmath78 to be uniform , the probability is @xmath86 that after @xmath78 shuffles we produce a grove in @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath87 be the set of groves of order @xmath76 that can be obtained by shuffling a grove in @xmath79 .",
    "the order of @xmath88 is @xmath89 .",
    "this is because in each of the pre - images there are @xmath81 downward - pointing triangles with no edges present , and every such triangle can be shuffled to any of three upward - pointing triangles .",
    "furthermore , the only edges where the groves of @xmath79 differ will be annihilated upon shuffling .",
    "so there is a @xmath90 chance that one of the pre - images of @xmath77 will actually shuffle into @xmath77 .",
    "therefore the probability that @xmath76 iterations of grove shuffling yields @xmath77 is @xmath91 now we claim that @xmath92 .",
    "if so , then the probability computed above is equal to @xmath93 as desired .",
    "let us make some basic observations from @xcite or by easy induction .",
    "first , @xmath94 ; the total number of downward - pointing triangles in any grove of order @xmath78 .",
    "secondly , @xmath95 ; the total number of edges in any grove of order @xmath78 . then @xmath96 , and the theorem is proved .",
    "we now describe the phenomenon that we analyze in section [ sec : act ] .",
    "first we observe that edges are indexed relative to the corners perpendicular to them , so in fact the edges @xmath81 and @xmath97 in the description of grove shuffling have the same label : @xmath98 .",
    "horizontal edges are indexed relative to the bottom corner , and the diagonal edges are indexed relative to the top - right and top - left corners . in this way we can think of grove - shuffling as more akin to domino shuffling @xcite . rather than replacing edges with parallel edges , we `` slide '' edges toward the corners along perpendicular lines .",
    "when a downward - pointing triangle has two edges , we remove both of those edges because they `` annihilate '' each other . when a downward - pointing triangle has no edges , we create two new ones randomly .",
    "[ h ]     with this viewpoint , we define an edge to be _ frozen _ if it can not be annihilated under any further iterations of grove shuffling .",
    "clearly the bottom corner edge , @xmath99 , is frozen when present .",
    "then the edge @xmath45 is frozen exactly when the edges @xmath100 are frozen , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "diagonal edges behave similarly . in figure",
    "[ fig : frozenexample ] all the highlighted edges are frozen .",
    "we conclude this section by examining a picture of a large random grove generated by grove shuffling . in figure",
    "[ fig : ord100 ] , we see that outside of a certain region , all of the edges are parallel",
    ". moreover , the boundary between the less uniform interior and the frozen regions in the corners seems to approximate a circle . proving that this boundary approaches a circle in the limit is the main goal of this paper .",
    "for any @xmath4 , we can scale the initial conditions so that they resemble an equilateral triangle with sides of length @xmath103 , by mapping each vertex @xmath25 to @xmath104 .",
    "the corner vertices @xmath105 are scaled to @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "we will show that outside of the circle inscribed in this triangle , there is homogeneity of the edges in an appropriately scaled random grove of order @xmath4 , with probability approaching 1 as @xmath108 .",
    "specifically , we will examine the limiting probability of finding a particular type of edge in a given location outside of the inscribed circle .",

    "we prove the following formula for finding the edge probability @xmath117 in terms of creation rates .",
    "the horizontal edge probabilities are given recursively by @xmath118 .",

    "this point is a singularity of the variety that , as we have seen , resembles a cone point locally .",
    "the papers of pemantle and wilson give asymptotics near smooth points of the singular variety and near multiple points of the singular variety , but not near singular points of the singular variety as in our case .",

    "we now draw parallels between the examination of the behavior of large groves on standard initial conditions , and the behavior of tilings of large aztec diamonds . this approach yields no new results for aztec diamonds , but presents an alternative approach to their study . in this section",
    "we derive a generating function for the probabilities @xmath117 that position @xmath327 in a tiling of an aztec diamond of order @xmath4 is covered by a particular type of horizontal domino .",

    "some recursive formulas for @xmath117 are given in @xcite , and are the inspiration for our derivation of the edge probabilities for groves .",
    "we begin by describing precisely how tilings of aztec diamonds are encoded in the terms of polynomials generated by the octahedron recurrence .",
    "first of all , rather than considering tilings of an aztec diamond , we prefer to consider perfect matchings of the dual graph of this region .",
    "we call such a graph an _ aztec diamond graph_. the aztec diamond graph of order @xmath4 has as its vertices the set @xmath328 . in other words",

    "each vertex is connected with an edge to its nearest horizontal and vertical neighbors .",

    "each monomial is of the form @xmath340 where @xmath341 is the number of edges surrounding face @xmath327 in the dual matching to the tiling @xmath188 .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : adex ] we see the tiling associated with the monomial @xmath342    [ h ]     the assertion that aztec diamond tilings can be so encoded is just a special case of theorem 5.5 of eric kuo s paper on graphical condensation @xcite . here",
    "we take the weight of a tiling @xmath188 of order @xmath4 to be @xmath335 as above .",
    "domino shuffling is the name given to the local move that can be used to generate random tilings of aztec diamonds . in a tiling of an aztec diamond",
    "there are four types of dominoes , which may be characterized as follows .",
    "make a checkerboard coloring of the aztec diamond of order @xmath4 by making the leftmost square in each row of the top half of the diamond be white .",
    "a horizontal domino is _ north - going _ if its leftmost square is white , _ south - going _ if its leftmost square is black .",
    "similarly , a vertical domino is _ east - going _ if its topmost square is black , _ west - going _ if its topmost square is white .",
    "domino shuffling is described in detail in @xcite , but basically each domino slides in the direction indicated by its name .",
    "north - going dominoes take one step north , south - going dominoes head south , and so on .",
    "however , two dominoes may not pass through one another .",
    "if a north- and south- or east- and west - going pair of dominoes collide , they annihilate one another , and the resulting hole and any other holes opened by sliding dominoes is filled in with a pair of dominoes : two horizontals with probability 1/2 , or two verticals with probability 1/2 . using this description we have ,    [ thm : ds ] the horizontal edge probabilities",
    "are given recursively by @xmath343 .",
    "thus , @xmath344 .",
    "the proof of the theorem can be found in @xcite .",
    "it follows more or less directly from the definition of domino shuffling , where @xmath116 is the _ net creation rate _ ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .      by differentiating the uniformly weighted version of the octahedron recurrence @xmath345 and",
    "because @xmath346 we obtain @xmath347 from this recurrence and theorem [ thm : ds ] we get the generating function : @xmath348    this is the form of the generating function used as an example in @xcite . a weak arctic circle theorem like",
    "our theorem [ thm : wac ] follows directly from that example .",
    "probabilities throughout the diamond could be extracted from this function in principle , and current work of cohn and pemantle seeks to carry out this more difficult analysis .",
    "[ h ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    another variation on the model presented in this paper would be to study  groves with a drift , \" i.e. , rather than having the random choice in grove shuffling be uniform , we make a biased choice . for example",
    ", say we choose the two diagonal edges with probability @xmath242 , the horizontal and one of the diagonal edges with probability @xmath349 , and the horizontal and the other diagonal edge with probability @xmath350 .",
    "this bias is reflected in the cube recurrence by setting @xmath351 the generating function for biased creation rates is then @xmath352 we can also derive the generating function for biased horizontal edge probabilities : @xmath353 as seen in figure [ fig : bias ] , the arctic circle is just a special case of what one might call the `` arctic ellipse , '' dependent on the free parameters @xmath354 .",
    "using the same approach as in the unbiased case where @xmath355 , we can prove the following theorem without too much difficulty .",
    "[ thm : wac2 ] the boundary of the frozen region for ( rescaled ) groves with a drift is given by the intersection of the plane @xmath247 with the surface @xmath356 where @xmath357 , @xmath358 , and @xmath359 .    aside from simply describing the shape of the frozen region in the biased situation , it may also be useful to observe how the area of the temperate zone varies in @xmath242 and @xmath349 ( with respect to the area of the entire grove ) .",
    "specifically , we can compute the ratio of the area of the temperate zone , @xmath360 , to the area of the entire grove , @xmath361 , as a function of @xmath242 and @xmath349 .",
    "given that @xmath362 , @xmath363",
    "as mentioned , we hope to apply the methods of pemantle and wilson to determine asymptotic probabilities throughout a random grove .",
    "based on computer experiments and the similarity of groves and aztec diamond tilings seen so far , we believe a formula for such probabilities exists . another future aim is to apply the methods of growth models and statistical mechanics to groves , in the style of johansson @xcite , @xcite , or more recently kenyon , okounkov , and sheffield @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "perhaps something can be proved about the variance of the boundary circle by interpreting groves in a more familiar setting .",
    "one clever way for determining the boundary of the frozen region for aztec diamond tilings is to look at a frozen corner as a randomly growing young diagram .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for this interpretation .",
    "a nearly identical projection of the frozen region of a grove yields some sort of randomly growing young diagram , but it seems to follow more intricate rules of growth than those of aztec diamond tilings .    [ h ]     if we project the grove onto the plane @xmath364 we see a triangular array of boxes with two types of diagonal edges .",
    "let us put the corner box at the upper - left and index it as ( 0,0 ) .",
    "then we index the rows by @xmath365 , the columns by @xmath366 , so that each box has index @xmath327 with @xmath367 .",
    "a diagonal edge from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of a box corresponds to a short edge in the grove .",
    "edges from the top right to bottom left correspond to long edges in the grove .",
    "the box @xmath327 is _ frozen _ if it contains a long edge and all the boxes @xmath368 contain long edges , @xmath369 , @xmath370 . clearly the collection of all frozen boxes is a young diagram .",
    "we would like to be able to describe how this young diagram grows under grove shuffling .",
    "[ h ]     in a randomly growing young diagram , we call box @xmath327 a _ growth position _ if boxes @xmath371 and @xmath372 are both frozen and @xmath327 is not frozen ( we use the convention that boxes of the form @xmath373 are always frozen ) . in the case of aztec diamond tilings , the growth of a frozen corner under domino shuffling corresponds exactly to adding a new box at each growth position independently with probability 1/2 . with groves",
    "this is not the case , though it may not be clear from figure [ fig : gyd ] .",
    "in fact , two groves may have the same young diagram projection , yet grow very differently upon shuffling .",
    "it can happen that , at a particular growth position , one grove will not permit the addition of a new box under any circumstances , whereas the other will add a box with probability 2/3 .",
    "another difference seems to suggest the need for a new definition of growth position .",
    "it is possible that a grove can project to a young diagram with growth position @xmath327 , but after just one iteration of grove shuffling the projection adds a box not only to position @xmath327 , but also position @xmath374 .",
    "in fact for any @xmath78 there is a grove of some ( perhaps large ) order @xmath4 with growth position @xmath327 , so that with positive probability its projection to a young diagram adds boxes @xmath375 upon one iteration of grove shuffling .",
    "perhaps such situations are outliers , but there is still much work to do in this direction .",
    "much of the statistical study of groves is motivated by analogy with statistics for domino tilings of aztec diamonds .",
    "but there is at least one interesting feature of groves that seems to have no analogy in the realm of aztec diamonds .",
    "we conclude the paper with some observations about a unique vertex that is present in every grove .",
    "we call this special vertex the _ nexus_. loosely speaking ,",
    "the nexus is the vertex at the  middle \" of the unique tree connected to all three sides of the initial conditions .",
    "if the nexus and its incident edges are removed from the grove , then all three sides become disconnected from one another . in figure",
    "[ fig : nex ] we see the nexus highlighted .",
    "[ h ]     let @xmath30 be a grove of order @xmath376 or @xmath377 , @xmath378 .",
    "the _ nexus _ of @xmath30 is the ( even ) vertex @xmath39 which is connected to each of the three",
    "_ midpoints _ : @xmath379 , @xmath380 , and @xmath381 , and for which each midpoint lies on a distinct branch of the tree rooted at @xmath39 .",
    "we would like to understand how the nexus moves during grove shuffling .",
    "the nexus takes some kind of random walk in the initial conditions , but it is not a simple random walk . in some sense",
    "the nexus is a `` stuttering '' random walker . in some situations",
    "the nexus takes a step in one of three directions with equal probability , in others it does not move at all , and in still others it moves deterministically . specifically ,",
    "if the nexus is at an  up \" vertex ( see section [ sec : init ] ) then after one iteration of grove shuffling it will take a step in one of three directions , each with equal probability .",
    "if the nexus is at a  down \" vertex , then after one iteration of grove shuffling the nexus will not move ( and so becomes a  flat \" vertex in the new grove ) . strangely , if the nexus is at a flat vertex then depending on which edges lead from the nexus to the midpoints , the nexus will either move deterministically one step or it will not move .",
    "ultimately we want to say something about the distance of the nexus from the center of the grove as the size of the grove gets very large .",
    "how far from home does the nexus roam ?",
