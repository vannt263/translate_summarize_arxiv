    "understanding the properties of the nucleon is of obvious importance in hadron physics .",
    "a variety of nucleon matrix elements of bilinear quark operators have been evaluated in the past using various approaches .",
    "the qcd sum - rule method originally proposed by shifman , vainstein , and zakharov @xcite and its extension by ioffe and smilga @xcite for external field problems , provide a tractable framework for the study of these nucleon matrix elements .",
    "these include the matrix element of electromagnetic current to determine the magnetic moments @xcite , the matrix element of the axial vector current to find the renormalization of nucleon axial coupling constant @xcite , the matrix element of the quark part of the energy momentum tensor , which gives the momentum fraction carried by the up and down quarks in deep inelastic scattering @xcite , and the matrix element of isoscalar - scalar current for evaluating the nucleon sigma term @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the matrix element of the isovector - scalar density , @xmath3 , following the same external field approach .",
    "the appearance of the external field leads to specific new features in qcd sum rules which distinguish them from those in the absence of the external field .",
    "thus the phenomenological representation of the correlation function written in terms of physical intermediate states contains a double pole at the nucleon mass whose residue contains the matrix element of interest .",
    "in addition there are single pole terms which arise from the transition matrix element between the ground state nucleon and excited states .",
    "these later contributions are not exponentially damped after borel transformation relative to the double pole term and should be retained in a consistent analysis of the sum rules . in the theoretical side of the sum rules expressed in terms of an operator product expansion ( ope )",
    "the external field contributes in two different ways  by directly coupling to the quark fields in the nucleon current and by polarizing the qcd vacuum .",
    "since for our problem the external field is a lorentz scalar , non - scalar correlators can not be induced in the qcd vacuum .",
    "however the external field does modify the quark and gluon condensates already present in the qcd vacuum .",
    "it turns out that for the problem under study the most important one is the response of the up and down quark chiral condensates to the external field which can be described by a susceptibility @xmath4 .",
    "this can be determined by writing a spectral representation , which can be evaluated for example by using chiral perturbation theory .",
    "alternatively , since in the real world up and down quark masses are different , @xmath5 itself can be regarded as an external isovector scalar field and @xmath4 can be related to the isospin breaking in quark condensates @xmath6 and is given to first order in @xmath7 by @xmath8 . at the current level of accuracy where these two determinations can be done , they are mutually consistent .    in sec .",
    "[ sumrule ] we derive the sum rules for the nucleon current correlation function in an external isovector - scalar field and describe the analysis of these sum rules , which leads us to determine @xmath0 .",
    "we also study its dependence on the @xmath4 value .    in sec .",
    "[ npd ] we show that an evaluation of the matrix element @xmath9 enables us to compute the non - electromagnetic part of the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "since the 1970 s it has been recognized that the empirical mass difference arises from two sources .",
    "one is purely electromagnetic and yields a contribution of @xmath10@xcite to the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "the second source is the difference between up and down quark masses , which is of the order of the quark masses themselves .",
    "this difference leads to larger contribution which overrides the electromagnetic contribution making neutron heavier than proton . to first order in @xmath7 this later contribution",
    "is given by the product of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "recently several authors @xcite have applied the qcd sum rules for the nucleon mass to extract the neutron - proton mass difference by including the up and down quark masses in the mass sum rules for proton and neutron and the isospin breaking in the condensates .",

    "the latter is estimated to be @xcite @xmath167 the experimental mass difference is 1.29 mev , which then gives @xmath168    in the last section we saw that uncertainty in our knowledge of @xmath4 leads to a corresponding uncertainty in our determination of @xmath61 . for the @xmath4 value obtained from chiral perturbation theory [ see eq .",
    "( [ chiva ] ) ] , we get @xmath169 .    for @xmath4 values in the range @xmath170",
    ", we find @xmath171 which is consistent with experimental data .",
    "smaller and larger values of @xmath4 outside the range considered above lead to correspondingly smaller and larger values for the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "one of our main objectives in this paper has been to extract the proton matrix element @xmath172 .",
    "we have seen that the chiral - odd sum rule eq .",
    "( [ fiq ] ) is reliable for determining this matrix element .",
    "the major limiting factor has been the uncertainty in the value of the susceptibility @xmath4 . a more accurate evaluation of the two point function eq .  ( [ chi ] ) should reduce the uncertainty in the value of @xmath4 and hence help to pin down the value of the matrix element @xmath61 .",
    "we also saw that the non - electromagnetic part of the neutron - proton mass difference is essentially given by the matrix element @xmath61 multiplied by the light quark mass difference @xmath11 .",
    "if we use a median value @xmath173 mev and @xmath174 as obtained using a value of @xmath175 we get @xmath169 , which indeed has the right sign and magnitude .",
    "this suggest that our approach to extract @xmath61 and the neutron - proton mass difference is reliable .",
    "however , since @xmath4 and @xmath7 are not precisely known we can not make a critical comparison with data at present .",
    "we now turn to a comparison of our method with those of earlier authors .",
    "the nucleon mass was originally extracted by ioffe @xcite with a _ combined _ use of both the chiral - odd and chiral - even mass sum rules .",
    "it is necessary to use these two sum rules together since one must eliminate the coupling constant @xmath176 .",
    "belyaev and ioffe @xcite extended this method to determine the mass splitting between hyperon and nucleon by treating the strange quark mass as a perturbation .",
    "in addition to the mass shift , @xmath177 , one must also take into account the change in the coupling constant @xmath178 and the change in the continuum threshold @xmath69 .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite used the same procedure to determine the mass splittings within an isospin multiplet by treating @xmath179 and @xmath180 as perturbation parameters . in ref .",
    "@xcite the neutron - proton mass was extracted directly from the difference between the neutron and proton mass sum rules , but the continuum contributions were disregarded . in ref .",
    "@xcite , adami _ et.al .",
    "_ retained continuum corrections but regarded @xmath102 as a parameter to be determined by a fit to all isospin splittings in the baryon octet . in ref .",
    "@xcite , apart from the perturbation due to the quark masses , an attempt was made to incorporate the electromagnetic contribution also phenomenologically in the sum rules .",
    "the sum rules derived by us in sec .",
    "[ sumrule ] can also be derived directly from the mass sum rules .",
    "writing @xmath181 , @xmath182 and using @xmath183 one can differentiate eqs .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 17 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "one can then identify our sum rules eqs .",
    "( [ fiq ] ) and ( [ fi1 ] ) with eqs .",
    "( 29 ) and ( 30 ) of ref .",
    "( an assumption about the mixed chiral condensate , equivalent to our assumption , @xmath184 , was made in ref .",
    "this coincidence between the sum rules is not surprising , since the quark mass term in the qcd lagrangian can also be regarded as a constant external scalar field .",
    "the double pole term in the rhs of our sum rules clearly arises from the simple pole term in the mass sum rules after the differentiation of the proton mass with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "we note that the term proportional to the mixed quark - gluon condensate [ the fourth term in the lhs of our eq .",
    "( [ fiq ] ) ] has not been included in ref .",
    "we have seen in our analysis of the sum rules ( see fig.2 ) that this term is numerically significant .",
    "there is also a minor discrepancy in the coefficient of the four - quark condensate term between ref .",
    "@xcite and this work ( or ref .",
    "this discrepancy comes from the fact that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite directly used the @xmath185 and @xmath186 mass sum rules from ref .",
    "@xcite , where _ not _ all the quark mass terms were taken into account .",
    "it is now easy to see , as discussed earlier in sec .",
    "[ sumrule ] , why eq .",
    "( [ fiq ] ) is a better sum rule as compared to the chiral - even sum rule eq .",
    "( [ fi1 ] ) .",
    "in the chiral - odd sum rule , the perturbation due to the finite quark mass does not affect the leading asymptotic behavior and hence when a differentiation with respect to @xmath11 ( alternately when the neutron and proton sum rule difference is taken ) the leading asymptotic behavior reduces to a smaller power of the borel mass @xmath125 , which in turn means weaker dependence on the continuum contribution .",
    "on the other hand , in the chiral - even sum rule the introduction of quark mass leads to the term @xmath187 in the proton and @xmath188 in the neutron sum rule .",
    "consequently in the difference the leading asymptotic behavior is now @xmath189 . in other words ,",
    "the continuum contributions are enhanced .",
    "this feature is also clearly reflected in our analysis in sec .",
    "[ sumrule ] . for",
    "the chiral - odd sum rule the double pole term residue was stable when @xmath69 was varied while in the chiral - even sum rule the corresponding residue was unstable .",
    "further , in the chiral - even sum rule the single pole term corresponding to transition between proton and the excited states dominated over the double pole term .",
    "we would also like to point out that inclusion of instanton contributions improves the chiral - even mass sum rule @xcite . in the light of our observations above regarding the relation of our sum rules to the mass sum",
    "rules it suggests that such instanton contributions can also be significant in our sum rule eq .",
    "( [ fi1 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that in our work two stages are involved .",
    "we first calculate a hadronic matrix element @xmath61 .",
    "this involves the susceptibility @xmath4 , which being essentially the ratio @xmath190/@xmath11 is relatively insensitive to errors in our knowledge of @xmath11 .",
    "the quark mass part of the neutron - proton mass difference was obtained as the product @xmath191 .    as a final remark we shall comment on the nolen - schiffer anomaly @xcite .",
    "we saw in the last section that the empirical neutron - proton mass difference can be written as @xmath192 now , it is well known that the matrix element of the axial vector current is quenched @xcite inside the nuclear medium by about 30 percent",
    ". it may be reasonable to assume that the isovector - scalar matrix element latexmath:[$\\langle p| \\overline u u - \\overline d d    for example a 30 percent reduction in the value of @xmath61 , it follows form eq .",
    "( [ mnp ] ) that the effective mass difference in the nuclear medium is @xmath194 . understanding the nolen - schiffer anomaly",
    "is then reduced to explain the quenching of @xmath195 in nuclear medium .",
    "this can be handled either by traditional nuclear structure calculations or again by use of qcd sum rules as in the quenching of nucleon axial coupling @xcite .",
