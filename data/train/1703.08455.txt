    "wearable personal trackers that collect sensor data about the wearer , have long been used for patient monitoring in health care .",
    "holter monitors  @xcite , with large and heavy enclosures , that use tapes for recording , have recently evolved into affordable personal fitness trackers ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , popular health centric _ social sensor networks _ have emerged .",
    "products like fitbit  @xcite , garmin forerunner@xcite and jawbone up  @xcite require users to carry wireless trackers that continuously record a wide range of fitness and health parameters ( e.g. , steps count , heart rate , sleep conditions ) , tagged with temporal and spatial coordinates . trackers report recorded data to a providing server , through a specialized wireless base , that connects to the user s personal computer ( see figures  [ fig : system : main ] and  [ fig : system : maingarmin ] ) .",
    "the services that support these trackers enable users to analyze their fitness trends with maps and charts , and share them with friends in their social networks .",
    "all happening too quickly both for vendors and users alike , this data - centric lifestyle , popularly referred to as the quantified self or `` lifelogging '' is now producing massive amounts of intimate personal data .",
    "for instance , bodymedia  @xcite has created one of the world s largest libraries of raw and real - world human sensor data , with 500 trillion data points  @xcite .",
    "this data is becoming the source of privacy and security concerns : information about locations and times of user fitness activities can be used to infer surprising information , including the times when the user is not at home  @xcite , and company organizational profiles  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate vulnerabilities in the storage and transmission of personal fitness data in popular trackers from fitbit  @xcite and garmin  @xcite .",
    "vulnerabilities have been identified for similar systems , including pacemakers ( e.g. , halperin et al .",
    "@xcite ) and glucose monitoring and insulin delivery systems ( e.g. , li et .",
    "the differences in the system architecture and communication model of social sensor networks enable us to identify and exploit different vulnerabilities .",
    "we have built two attack tools , fitbite and garmax , and show how they inspect and inject data into nearby fitbit ultra and garmin forerunner trackers .",
    "the attacks are fast , thus practical even during brief encounters .",
    "we believe that , the vulnerabilities that we identified in the security of fitbit and garmin are due to the many constraints faced by solution providers , including time to release , cost of hardware , battery life , features , mobility , usability , and utility to end user .",
    "unfortunately , such a constrained design process often puts security in the back seat .    to help address these constraints , in this paper we introduce senscrypt , a protocol for secure fitness data storage and transmission on lightweight personal trackers .",
    "we leverage the unique system model of social sensor networks to encode data stored on trackers using two pseudo - random values , one generated on the tracker and one on the providing server .",
    "this enables senscrypt , unlike previous work  @xcite , to protect not only against inspect and inject attacks , but also against attackers that physically capture and read the memory of trackers .",
    "senscrypt s hardware and computation requirements are minimal , just enough to perform low - cost symmetric key encryption and cryptographic hashes .",
    "senscrypt does not impose storage overhead on trackers and ensures an even wear of the tracker storage , extending the life of flash memories with limited program / erase cycles .    senscrypt is related to dabinder ( naveed et al .",
    "@xcite ) , an android level defense .",
    "dabinder generates and enforces secure bonding policies between a device and its official app , to prevent external device mis - bonding attacks for bluetooth enabled android health / medical devices .",
    "senscrypt is built for a different platform and also , unlike dabinder , minimizes the role played by the base .",
    "senscrypt is applicable to a range of sensor based platforms , that includes a large number of popular fitness  @xcite and home monitoring solutions  @xcite , as well as scenarios where the sensors need to be immobile and operable without network connectivity ( e.g. , infrastructure , traffic , building and campus monitoring solutions ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the bases through which the sensors sync with the webserver are mobile , e.g. , smartphones of workers , who may become proximal to the sensors with the intention of data collection or as a byproduct of routine operations .",
    "we have developed sens.io , a $ 52 tracker platform built on arduino uno , of similar capabilities with current solutions .",
    "on sens.io , senscrypt ( i ) imposes a 6ms overhead on tracker writes , ( ii ) reduces the end - to - end overhead of data uploads to 50% of that of fitbit , and ( iii ) enables a server to support large volumes of tracker communications . in conclusion ,",

    "[ section  [ sec : solution ] ] show that senscrypt protects even against invasive attackers , capable of reading the memory of captured trackers [ section  [ sec : analysis ] ] .",

    ", we will use `` fitbit '' to refer the fitbit ultra and `` garmin '' to denote the garmin forerunner 610 solution .    * the tracker . *",
    "the _ tracker _ is a wearable device that records , stores and reports a variety of user fitness related metrics .",
    "we focus on the following trackers :    * the fitbit tracker * measures the daily steps taken , distance traveled , floors climbed , calories burned , the duration and intensity of the user exercise , and sleep patterns .",
    "it consists of four ic chips , ( i ) a mma7341l 3-axis mems accelerometer , ( ii ) a mems altimeter to count the number of floors climbed and ( iii ) a msp 430f2618 low power ti mcu consisting of 92 kb of flash and 96 kb of ram .",
    "the user can switch between displaying different real - time fitness information on the tracker , using a dedicated hardware _",
    "button ( see the arrow pointing to the switch in figure  [ fig : system : main ] ) .",
    "* the garmin tracker * records data at user set periodic intervals ( 1 - 9 seconds ) .",
    "the data includes a timestamp , exercise type , average speed , distance traveled , altitude , start and end position , heart rate and calories burned during the past interval .",
    "the tracker has a heart rate monitor ( optional ) and a 12 channel gps receiver with a built - in sirfstariii antenna . that enables the user to tag activities with spatial coordinates .",
    "both fitbit and garmin trackers have chips supporting the ant protocol , with a 15 ft transmission range for fitbit and 33 ft for garmin .",
    "each tracker has a unique i d , called the _ tracker public i d _ ( tpi ) .",
    "trackers also store profile information of their users , including age , gender and physiological information such as height , weight and gait information .    * the base and agent module .",
    "* the base connects with the user s main computing center ( e.g. , pc , laptop ) and with trackers within transmission range ( 15 ft for fitbit and 33 ft for forerunner ) over the ant protocol .",
    "the user needs to install an `` agent module '' , a software provided by the service provider ( fitbit , garmin ) to run on the base .",
    "the agent and base act as a bridge between the tracker and the online social network .",
    "they upload information stored on the tracker to its user account on the webserver , see figures  [ fig : system : main ] and  [ fig : system : maingarmin ] for system snapshots .",
    "* tracker to base pairing*. fitbit trackers communicate to any base in their vicinity . however , tracker solutions like garmin forerunners allow trackers to communicate only through bases to which they have been previously `` paired '' or `` bonded '' .",
    "garmin s pairing procedure works in the following manner . the agent running on the base searches for available ant enable devices .",
    "each tracker periodically sends broadcast beacons over the ant interface .",
    "if the agent discovers a tracker , it extracts its unique i d ( tpi ) .",
    "the agent uses one of two methods of authentication : initial _ pairing _ or _",
    "passkey_. the agent verifies if it already stores an authfile for this tpi . if no such file exists ( i.e. , this is the first time the tracker is pairing with the base ) , the agent uses the _ pairing _ method and sends a bind request to the tracker .",
    "when prompted , the user needs to authenticate the operation , through the push of a button on the tracker .",
    "the agent then retrieves a factory embedded `` passkey '' from the tracker .",
    "it then stores the pair @xmath0 in a newly created authfile . during subsequent authentications",
    ", the agent uses the _ passkey _ method : it recovers the passkey corresponding to the tpi from the authfile and uses it to authenticate the tracker .",
    "the system model considered can be extended to cover the case of fitness tracking solutions that turn the user s mobile device into a base , e.g. ,  @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the agent module is a mobile app running on the mobile device .",
    "the tracker communicates with the smartphone over existing network interfaces , e.g. , bluetooth or nfc .",
    "we note that naveed et al .",
    "@xcite identified an intriguing vulnerability of android smartphones bonded to health trackers .",
    "the vulnerability stems from the fact that the bonding occurs at smartphone device level not at the app level .",
    "this effectively leaves the health data vulnerable to rogue apps with bluetooth permissions .",
    "* the webserver . *",
    "the online social network webserver ( e.g. , fitbit.com , connect.garmin.com ) , allows users to create accounts from which they befriend and maintain contact with other users . upon purchase of a tracker and base , the user binds the tracker to her social network account .",
    "each social network account has a unique i d , called the _ user public i d _ ( upi ) .",
    "when the base detects and sets up a connection with a nearby tracker , it automatically collects and reports tracker stored information ( step count , distance , calories , sleep patterns ) with temporal and spatial tags , to the corresponding user s social network account . in the following ,",
    "we use the term _ webserver _ to denote the computing resources of the online social network .",
    "* tracker - to - base communication : the ant protocol .",
    "* trackers communicate to bases over ant , a 2.4 ghz bidirectional wireless personal area network ( pan ) ultra - low power consumption communication technology , optimized for transferring low - data rate , low - latency data",
    ".    * data conversion . *",
    "the fitbit tracker relies on the user s walk and run stride length values to convert the step count into the distance covered .",
    "it then extrapolates the user s basal metabolic rate ( bmr )  @xcite values and uses them to convert the user s daily activities into burned calories values .",
    "the garmin tracker uses the gps receiver to compute the outdoor distance covered by the user .",
    "it then relies on the firstbeat@xcite algorithm to convert user data ( gender , height , weight , fitness class ) and the captured heart rate information to estimate the user s metabolic equivalent ( met ) , which in turn is used to retrieve the calories burnt .",
    "we assume that the webserver is honest , and is trusted by all participants .",
    "we assume adversaries that are able to launch the following types of attacks :    * inspect attacks*. the adversary listens on the communications of trackers , bases and the webserver .",
    "* inject attacks*. the adversary exploits solution vulnerabilities to modify and inject messages into the system , as well as to jam existing communications .",
    "* capture attacks*. the adversary is able to acquire trackers or bases of victims .",
    "the adversary can subject the captured hardware to a variety of other attacks ( e.g. , inspect and inject ) but can not access the memory of the hardware .",
    "we assume that in addition to captured devices , the adversary can control any number of trackers and bases ( e.g. , by purchasing them ) .",
    "* jtag attacks*. jtag and boundary scan based attacks ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , extend the capture attack with the ability to access the memory of captured devices .",
    "we focus here on `` jtag - read '' ( jtag - r ) attacks , where the attacker reads the content of the _ entire _ tracker memory .      our goal in reverse - engineering the fitbit ultra and garmin forerunner protocols was dual , ( i ) to understand the source(s ) of vulnerabilities and ( ii ) to develop security solutions that are interoperable with these protocols .",

    "unlike fitbit , garmin uses https with tls v1.1 to send user login credentials .",
    "however , similar to fitbit , all other communications are sent over plaintext http .",
    "fitbit and garmin bases both use _ service logs _ , files that store information concerning communications involving the base .",
    "garmin s logs consist of an `` authfile '' for each tracker that was paired with the base , and .fit files .",
    "the authfile contains authentication information for each tracker .",

    "<S> the increasing popular interest in personal telemetry , also called the quantified self or `` lifelogging '' , has induced a popularity surge for wearable personal fitness trackers . </S>",
    "<S> fitness trackers automatically collect sensor data about the user throughout the day , and integrate it into social network accounts . </S>",
    "<S> solution providers have to strike a balance between many constraints , leading to a design process that often puts security in the back seat . </S>",
    "<S> case in point , we reverse engineered and identified security vulnerabilities in fitbit ultra and gammon forerunner 610 , two popular and representative fitness tracker products . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce fitbite and garmax , tools to launch efficient attacks against fitbit and garmin .    </S>",
    "<S> we devise senscrypt , a protocol for secure data storage and communication , for use by makers of affordable and lightweight personal trackers . </S>",
    "<S> senscrypt thwarts not only the attacks we introduced , but also defends against powerful jtag read attacks . </S>",
    "<S> we have built sens.io , an arduino uno based tracker platform , of similar capabilities but at a fraction of the cost of current solutions . </S>",
    "<S> on sens.io , senscrypt imposes a negligible write overhead and significantly reduces the end - to - end sync overhead of fitbit and garmin . </S>"
