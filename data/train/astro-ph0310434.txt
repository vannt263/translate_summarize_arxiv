    "the low lying @xmath1 rotationally excited state of oh has three hyperfine transitions in the 6-cm band : the f=0@xmath21 at 4660.242 mhz , the f=1@xmath21 at 4750.656 mhz , and the f=1@xmath20 at 4765.562 mhz ( lovas , johnson , & snyder 1979 ) . we have previously reported observations conducted with the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory of these lines in three sources : w3 ( gardner , whiteoak , & palmer 1983 ) , ngc 7538(irs1 ) ( palmer , gardner , & whiteoak 1984 ) , and sgr b2 ( gardner , whiteoak , & palmer 1987 ) . here",
    "we report observations of additional sources conducted in 1984 march  april .",
    "observations of the 6-cm oh lines have established that they are closely associated with star formation , and that in many sources they are the most highly variable of the oh maser lines .",
    "our primary interest in this paper is in the accurate positions of the observed lines and the variability of line intensities .",
    "subsequent papers in this series will report a detailed study of both ground state and excited state oh and h@xmath0o maser emission in one region and a vlba study of 4765-mhz emission in several regions .",
    "observations were made with 25 antennas of the vla . for the 1984 march observations ,",
    "the vla was in the cnb hybrid array ; in april , the c - array .",
    "these configurations provided beamwidths @xmath34 arcsec . for the 4765-mhz observations , a correlator bandwidth of 0.781 mhz",
    "was divided into 512 spectral channels . for the 4660- and 4750-mhz observations ,",
    "a bandwidth of 3.125 mhz was used in conjunction with 256 channels . on - line",
    "hanning smoothing of the resulting spectra and retention of every other channel yielded 256- and 128-channel spectra with resolution of 3.0 khz and 24 khz respectively . because of restricted data - taking rates at the vla at that time , observations were conducted in only one sense of polarisation ( right circular ) and only the central 31 of the hanning smoothed spectral channels were recorded .",
    "both previous observations and theory had established that these lines are unpolarised ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the only exception to date",
    "is monr2 , and in this case , it is argued that the polarisation may arise from amplification of a polarised background source ( smits , cohen , & hutawarakorn 1998 ) . because the 4765-mhz line is the most commonly detected of the three oh transitions",
    ", we observed only this line , except for w49a in which we observed all three oh lines .",
    "the velocity resolution for all 4765-mhz observations was 0.19 km  s@xmath4 yielding a total velocity coverage of @xmath52.88 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "for the other two lines observed in w49a , at 4750 mhz the resolution was 1.54 km  s@xmath4 yielding a velocity coverage of @xmath523.1 km  s@xmath4 and at 4660 mhz , 1.57 km  s@xmath4 yielding a velocity coverage of @xmath523.6 km  s@xmath4 . while the small velocity coverage at 4765 mhz was disappointing , we had access to then recent unpublished observations of these lines with the 100-m telescope at effelsberg by gardner ( private communication , hereafter ffg ) to use to plan our observations .",
    "the fwhm of the effelsberg telescope at this wavelength is @xmath33 arcmin , while the fwhm of the primary beam of the vla antennas at this wavelength is @xmath310 arcmin .",
    "therefore , any source detected by ffg would also be detected by the vla .",
    "however , any unexpected features outside the narrow velocity range that we were able to cover were not recorded .",
    "other details for each source are provided in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "all images produced from the observations extended well beyond the fwhm of the primary beam because some positions were not well known and to allow for serendipity .",
    "in addition to data for each line channel , a pseudo - continuum `` channel 0 '' was recorded .",
    "these data consist of an average over the central 3/4 of the spectral band . for the 4765-mhz observations ,",
    "channel 0 contained data from 192 of the 3.0 khz channels in the original ( mostly unrecorded ) hanning smoothed data set . for the 4750- and 4660-mhz observations , the pseudo - continuum was an average over 96 of the 24 khz channels .",
    "we checked carefully that the resulting continuum images were not contaminated by line emission by comparing them with images made from averages of known line - free channels . for dr21 , channel 0",
    "was not used .",
    "rather , a normal vla continuum observation was made ( 50-mhz bandwidth ) , so line contamination is not an issue .",
    "the results for the 4765-mhz line observations are summarised in table  [ tab : tab2 ] . to facilitate comparisons with recent work ,",
    "both b1950 and j2000 positions are given .",
    "the position uncertainties are caused by errors in positions of the phase calibrators , errors in array baselines , and thermal noise .",
    "phase calibrator positions were adjusted to modern values ( uncertainties @xmath60.01 arcsec ) and led to a sensible shift only for w49 ( 0.1 arcsec in declination ) .",
    "the errors quoted are 4-@xmath7 and are dominated by thermal noise except for the highest signal - to - noise source , dr21ex .",
    "no attempt was made to de - convolve the linewidths for instrumental broadening because in most cases the widths are close to our resolution . in the following subsections , a brief discussion is given for each source . because the 4765-mhz emission is very variable , in table  [ tab : tab3 ] we summarise all flux density measurements since these lines were discovered for the four detected sources . in order to compare our results with those obtained at different epochs by other observers when there was a significant difference in pointing position , we have corrected their measurements for the pointing offset from the vla - determined positions by assuming gaussian antenna beams . in a few cases the offsets are rather large so that the gaussian approximation is crude .",
    "the flux densities quoted are the corrected values , and this is indicated by a ( c ) following the value in table  [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "note that in some cases , exact dates of observations were not published .",
    "we estimate that the errors in flux densities in table  [ tab : tab3 ] are dominated by the absolute calibration uncertainties of the observations and are therefore about 10 per cent .",
    "this field is complex in the radio continuum ; but , because the vla in the c - array resolves out structures larger than @xmath330 arcsec , our continuum image shows only the compact source g192.58 - 0.04 @xcite .",
    "this source is located approximately between the optical nebulae s255 and s256 , and about 1 arcmin north of the cometary nebula pp56 which is associated with a near - ir source , both h@xmath0o and 1665-mhz ground state oh masers , and iras 06099 + 1800 .",
    "although ffg had detected a maser feature of amplitude 1.2 jy at v@xmath8= 6.61 km  s@xmath4 on september 15 , 1983 , approximately seven months later we detected no emission exceeding 50 mjy ( 5 @xmath7 ) .",
    "this line has not been detected subsequently : 1 @xmath7 upper limits of 230 mjy and 780 mjy were obtained in 1989 june / july ( cohen , masheder , & walker 1991 , hereafter cmw ) and in 1998 september 7 ( szymczak , kus , & hrynek 2000 , hereafter skh ) . for a maser at the position found by ffg",
    ", these upper limits should be increased by 16 per cent and 5 per cent , respectively . at the adopted distance to s255 and s256 ( 1.2 kpc ; @xcite ) , the projected separation between the 4765-mhz maser and pp56 corresponds to @xmath30.35 pc  that is , the source of the 4765-mhz maser is well separated from the other known masers in this field .      the spectrum at the position of maximum maser intensity is shown in fig .",

    "[ our c - array data does not contain the short spacings necessary to accurately image the extended flux density in this region which leads to the negative bowl around the bright compact sources ; a better image of all of the radio continuum from this region at 6 cm is found in roelfsema , goss , & geballe ( 1988 ) . ] in table  [ tab : tab3 ] , it can be seen that for most of the 20 years since its discovery ( @xcite , hereafter gmp ) , the flux density , while variable , has stayed within a factor of two of 1 jy  except for the flaring episode observed by skh .",

    "ground state oh is seen only in absorption in the immediate vicinity of k3 - 50 .",
    "the nearest maser feature seems to be the well known 1720-mhz source on-3 which is 2.25 arcmin to the northeast which corresponds to @xmath35 pc projected separation at the 7.4 kpc distance of the complex ( @xcite , scaled to an 8.5 kpc distance to the galactic centre ) .",
    "a more sensitive high resolution search for 18-cm masers would be worthwhile .",

    "many ground state oh masers in all four lines have been detected in this complex region as well as numerous h@xmath0o masers .",

    "comparisons of 18-cm oh masers in w49a with the 6-cm masers are difficult for two reasons .",
    "first , w49a contains many powerful ground state masers in all four lines so that fainter features may be confused .",
    "second , because w49a is @xmath95 times further away than dr21 and w75n for which we have noted closely spaced 4765-mhz and 1720-mhz features , neither linear resolution nor sensitivity to intrinsically faint features is comparable to those in the these sources . the continuum image from our data with the sites of 6-cm maser activity identified is shown in fig .",

    "note that our observations resolve out a significant amount of the extended flux density .",

    "the general agreement in profile shape and spatial distribution of the two lines together with the differences on a pixel - by - pixel basis , argue for excitation in the same volume of gas with minor differences in excitation from point to point .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] . for the 4660-mhz line ,",
    "the position of the eastern component ( near source g ) moves rather smoothly westward to the edge of source b as the velocity increases from v@xmath8=-4.32 km  s@xmath4 to v@xmath8=19.25 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the errors at each point depend on the signal to noise ; they are @xmath30.05 arcsec near the line maximum and @xmath30.2 arcsec at each end .",
    "the western component ( near source a ) is not visible at all velocities and is @xmath66 arcsec .",
    "similarly , for the 4750-mhz line , the position of maximum intensity moves rather smoothly as a function of velocity ( mostly in ra ) over about 4 arcsec .",
    "the emission in each channel is also slightly extended for both lines .",
    "note that these lines have much lower peak intensities than do the 4765-mhz lines reported above and that they have much greater fwhm s ( compare fig.s 1 and 3 ) .",
    "most of the published values must be read from plots and are therefore not precise ; but , including re - observations of these lines with the vla in 2001 august and november ( pg ) , it seems that neither of these lines has varied in the @xmath330 years since they were discovered .",
    "the only difference between the vla measurements and single dish measurements is that single dish measurements of the 4660-mhz line include varying amounts of the narrow feature near w49 south ( discussed in the next paragraph ) which would add about 70 mjy at @xmath10=@xmath314 km",

    "a possible association of 4660-mhz emission with 1612-mhz emission has been noted by @xcite in sgrb2 .",
    "our primary goal was to determine precise positions for the 4765-mhz masers .",
    "the principal limitation is that our velocity coverage did not allow us to include all now known velocity components .",
    "as shown in table 2 , our position determinations are more than adequate to guide vlbi observations .",
    "we note that in cases where features at several velocities are present , their separations are frequently not at the arc second scale ( like separations of 18-cm oh or h@xmath0o maser spots ) but by 10 s of arc second to arc minutes ( more similar to the separations of clumps of 18-cm oh or h@xmath0o maser spots ) .",
    "a byproduct of this work was a study of the time - variability of these masers .",
    "we have examined all published data , two unpublished studies ( ffg and rpz ) , and some of our work in progress ( pg ) . as most other observers have discovered , the 4765-mhz masers are highly time - variable .",
    "powerful flares such as reported for dr21ex by ffg and this paper and , most spectacularly , in mon r2 reported by @xcite are relatively rare .",
    "nevertheless , it is striking that over 20  30 year periods , three of the four maser sources detected in this paper have exceeded 6 jy at some time .",
    "that is , although usually rather faint , these masers occasionally reach flux density levels so that they could be detected in an observation of a few minutes duration with a typical 25-meter telescope .",
    "all known 4765-mhz features vary at some level , some at the 10 per cent level and others by more than 100 per cent .",
    "the region from which the spatially extended 4660-mhz and 4750-mhz emission is detected in w49a is exceptional in several ways .",
    "this region contains a partial ring of hii regions [ called source g by @xcite ] and several other compact continuum components ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this region also contains the dynamical centre of an exceptionally powerful h@xmath0o maser outflow .",
    "@xcite found that the velocity range exceeded 500 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "from a five epoch proper motion vlbi study , @xcite located the dynamical centre of the outflow within source g. the dynamical centre did not correspond to any of the sub - components g1 ",
    "g5 resolved by dmg with 0.8 arcsec resolution .",
    "subsequently g2 , the source nearest the dynamical centre was resolved into three sources : g2a ",
    "g2c by @xcite with 0.04 arcsec resolution .",
    "recently , @xcite in a study at 1.4-mm ( @xmath3 0.2 arcsec resolution ) identified an extension of g2b which corresponds to the dynamical centre of the h@xmath0o outflow .",
    "a possible solution to the `` lifetime problem '' for the large number of closely spaced compact hii regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is that they may be confined by surrounding molecular clouds with densities @xmath14 ",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 ( de pree , rodriguez & goss 1995 ) . a density range of @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 is required to collisionally excite the @xmath18 lines and it is above the range of density required for excitation of the 1.4-mm methyl cyanide emission observed by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the scenario of @xcite would provide a natural explanation for excitation of the observed oh and methyl cyanide lines . in summary , the entire region seems filled with dense gas in either a neutral or an ionised state .",
    "an important question is whether the spatially extended 4660-mhz and 4750-mhz emission is maser or thermal emission .",
    "the peak flux density at 4750-mhz is 97 mjy / beam in a 4.11 arcsec x 1.72 arcsec beam , corresponding to a brightness temperature @xmath3700 k. for the 4660-mhz line , the peak brightness is 168 mjy / beam in a 4.33 arcsec x 1.70 arcsec beam corresponding to @xmath31200 k. therefore it is hard to escape the conclusion that the spatially extended 4660-mhz and 4750-mhz emission with broad velocity widths near w49a source g is maser emission .",
    "a picture that is compatible with the considerations above is that the 6-cm oh lines are usually weakly inverted in the dense gas surrounding star - forming regions .",
    "spatially extended , broad velocity , non - variable 4660-mhz and 4750-mhz lines are detectable whenever @xmath19 in the dense regions is large enough .",
    "because the 4765-mhz lines are more frequently found , conditions for large inversions must be reached occasionally for these lines , although the column density and velocity coherence reach high enough values to produce the narrow , intense lines at 4765-mhz along any line of sight only for relatively transient periods .",

    "<S> the vla was used to determine precise positions for 4765-mhz oh maser emission sources toward star - forming regions which had been observed about seven months earlier with the effelsberg 100-meter telescope . </S>",

    "<S> no line was detected toward s255 : this line had decreased to less than 5 per cent of the flux density observed only seven months earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the time - variability of the observed features during the past 30 years is summarised . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , to compare with the effelsberg observations , the 4750-mhz and 4660-mhz lines were observed in w49a . </S>",
    "<S> these lines were found to originate primarily from an extended region which is distinguished as an exceptional collection of compact continuum components as well as by being the dynamical centre of the very powerful h@xmath0o outflow .    </S>",
