    "<S> if the first scenario is true , one should find that @xmath100 and @xmath101 have different time dependence or equivalently @xmath28 and @xmath29 have different functional forms . however , if the second scenario is true , there should be not much difference between @xmath100 and @xmath101 or @xmath102 .    to conclude , the 3-step motility pattern of _ v. alginolyticus _ discovered in our recent experiment ( 8) allows significant variations bacterial chemotactic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> these variations can be acted on by natural selection and give rise to distinct phenotypes observed in the wild . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the 2-step swimming pattern of _ e. coli _ , cells of _ v. alginolyticus _ can engage in chemosensing and migration in both the forward and the backward swimming intervals , and hence their `` duty cycle '' is @xmath103 asan important aspect in 3-step chemotaxis is backtracking that gives those bacteria to re - exploit what they find a moment earlier . in our opinion </S>",
    "<S> , the full duty cycle , backtracking , and flicking are defining characteristics of _ v. alginolyticus_. these significant niches are likely selected for by the ocean environment where a quick response to transitory signals is important . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , we showed that the biphasic response is most effective when the forward @xmath22 and the backward @xmath23 swimming intervals are comparable . this makes biological sense since a brief forward or a brief backward interval contributes little to motility , and consequently a monophasic response is sufficient for migration . </S>",
    "<S> this also raises the interesting question why the non - motile cw interval in _ </S>",
    "<S> e. coli _ is so long , if tumbling is just to change the direction , not it be better if cw interval is shorter ? </S>",
    "<S> an interesting possibility is that the ancestral cell that gave `` birth '' to _ e. coli _ and _ v. alginolyticus _ was a 3-step swimmer . </S>",
    "<S> however , when _ e. coli _ specilized in a different environment , which favored multiple flagella for motility , they gave up backtracking and flicking , resulting in a tumbly movement . </S>",

    "<S> tumbling interval is long and its chemotactic response is biphasic .    </S>",
    "<S> based on motility alone , we propose two different mechanisms , independent and shared chemosensing , by which cells of _ v. alginolyticus _ can optimize their migration speed in a linear gradient . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the biphasic response appears in both types of chemotactic strategies . </S>",
    "<S> we know very little at present how the chemotaxis network of _ v. alginolyticus _ regulates the 3-step motility pattern . </S>",
