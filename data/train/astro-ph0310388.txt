    "an accurate determination of the star - formation history ( sfh ) of the universe is one of the key goals of modern observational cosmology .",
    "studies which measure , analyse and model its precise form are important not only in indicating likely epochs of dominant activity , but also for comparisons with the predictions of semi - analytical models of galaxy formation , and as such have provided a major impetus towards a fuller understanding of the physical mechanisms of galaxy evolution .",
    "various techniques now exist to measure star - formation rates ( sfrs ) in distant galaxies , all of which are sensitive in some way to the number of young , short - lived , and hence massive stars .",
    "these include nebular recombination ( e.g. ) and forbidden line ( e.g. ) emission , ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum measures in the wavelength range 1500 to 2800   , decimetric radio emission , and far - infrared continuum emission @xcite .",
    "currently , many of these diagnostics are only available over limited ( and sometimes non - overlapping ) redshift ranges , so studies of the evolution of the cosmic sfh have tended to combine many disparate studies measuring star - formation using a selection of the techniques described above , without an accurate understanding of how underlying physical processes in galaxies can affect different diagnostics .",
    "however , there has been recent progress in inter - comparing and calibrating these measures by investigating the degree to which the different diagnostics agree when measured for the same galaxies .",
    "work to date comparing /uv measures and radio//uv measures @xcite has revealed broad correlations but with a significant scatter , together with some offsets from relations expected from simple sfh scenarios . such discrepancies indicate either poorly understood dust extinction corrections ( particularly on uv measures ) , some physical parameter varying from galaxy to galaxy , such as the metallicity or initial mass function , or variations in the timescale of recent star - formation and consequent contamination of uv - continuum derived sfrs by older and less massive stars .",
    "we have been using a unique sample of local uv - selected galaxies to investigate these issues , constructed using the balloon - borne camera of which images the sky at 2000 . in @xcite",
    "we used this sample to construct the first local uv luminosity function , finding an integrated star - formation density higher than that found in local emission - line surveys .",
    "@xcite extended this sample , and performed initial investigations into the physical nature of star - formation in the sample comparing  and uv - derived sfrs .",
    "evidence for non - linearities and significant scatter was found , though questions over aperture corrections on the  measures and @xmath2-corrections on the uv luminosities remained .",
    "the radio properties @xcite and chemical properties @xcite of this sample have also been investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we further constrain the nature of star - formation in the sample .",
    "we extend our previous studies to include new broad - band @xmath0 and optical @xmath3 imaging observations of a substantial fraction of the galaxies in the survey , allowing accurate aperture and @xmath2-corrections to be made .",
    "we then use the combined samples to investigate the optical and stellar population properties of the sample , as well as to investigate sfrs derived from a second uv continuum measure in conjunction with that previously measured at 2000 .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : datasets ]",
    "we introduce the redshift survey data , including the new imaging campaigns .",
    "section  [ sec : optical - properties ] discusses the optical properties of the sample , allowing improved aperture and @xmath2-corrections for our spectroscopic data .",
    "section  [ sec : star - form - prop ] then examines the star - formation properties of the galaxies derived from /uv/@xmath0 observations .",
    "we model and discuss the implications of our results in section  [ sec : modelling ] , and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 ) cosmology .",
    "this paper extends our earlier work of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter t98 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s2000 ) by augmenting our photometric dataset with with more extensive and precise optical photometry . here",
    ", we introduce the new datasets which are analysed in this paper .",
    "we commence with a brief discussion of the existing datasets  uv imaging data taken from the foca experiment and the follow - up optical spectroscopy  followed by the details of the new imaging surveys of these fields .",
    "the foca instrument is a balloon - borne 40-cm cassegrain with a single filter approximating a gaussian centred at 2015 , fwhm 188   .",
    "two fields observed by foca are studied here : the high galactic - latitude region of selected area 57 ( sa57 ; @xmath8 , @xmath9 , j2000 ) and the field of the @xmath10 leo cluster , abell 1367 ( a1367 ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , j2000 ) .",
    "the uv exposure times corresponded to a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 in the foca photometric system ( @xmath14 ) .. ] both fields have extensive multi - fibre optical spectroscopy obtained using the wiyn / hydra ( 35006600 ; 3.1-arcsec diameter fibres ) and wht / wyffos ( 35009000 ; 2.7-arcsec diameter fibres ) telescope / instrument combinations , providing redshifts for 224 uv - selected emission - line galaxies , of which  fluxes can be reliably measured in 111 objects .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the wiyn data preclude observation of .",
    "fluxes , equivalent widths ( ews ) , and errors for each of the principle emission lines , as well as the strength of the 4000   balmer break ( d4000 ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are measured where the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the spectra permits . where  is not detected , an upper flux limit is estimated at the emission wavelength using the noise characteristics of each spectrum .    the balmer emission lines are corrected for the effects of stellar absorption as described in earlier papers ( s2000 ) , with a median correction of 2.5 .",
    "fluxes are also corrected for the effects of galactic extinction using the dust maps of @xcite and a @xcite extinction law .",
    "these corrections are small , with typical s of 0.01 and 0.02 for sa57 and a1367 respectively .",
    "the ratio of these corrected  and  fluxes is used to determine the colour excess of the ionised gas , , and hence the internal dust extinction assuming case - b recombination and a @xcite attenuation law .",
    "agn and qso - like objects are removed from the star - forming sample on the basis of their optical spectra ( objects with broad emission lines are discarded ) .",
    "of the remaining narrow - band objects , the vast majority are star - forming galaxies , as evidenced from diagnostic diagrams based upon the ratios of their principle emission lines @xcite . details of all these procedures can be found in @xcite .      the new optical data are taken from three sources : a @xmath0/@xmath15 palomar / lfc imaging programme of sa57 , @xmath16-band imaging using the cfht/12k camera , and supplementary @xmath17 data from the palomar digital sky survey ( dposs ) for both sa57 and a1367 .      the large format camera ( lfc * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the palomar 200-in hale telescope is a mosaic of six 2048x4096 pixel ccds ( though only four were available when the data for this paper were collected ) , covering a region of diameter @xmath18@xmath19 with a pixel scale of 0.175 arcseconds .",
    "data were collected over the course of six dark nights split over two observing runs in april 2000 and march 2001 .",
    "the 1.5@xmath20 diameter field of sa57 was mosaiced using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath0 and @xmath15 filters , with a tessellation pattern avoiding bright foreground stars which created serious saturation and bleed trails on the lfc ccds .",
    "exposure times were 2400s in @xmath0 and 600s in @xmath15. due to time constraints , we concentrated our observations on the centre of the sa57 field .",
    "the lfc data were reduced using a hybrid of the national optical astronomy observatories ( noao ) mosaic reduction software for use in iraf  @xcite as well as custom - written routines to deal with some issues specific to the lfc .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted using the overscan regions on the chips and nightly master bias frames .",
    "flat - fielding was performed using dome flats ( for @xmath15 data ) and twilight sky flats ( for @xmath0 data ) taken on each night .",
    "we also constructed a ` super - sky ' flat for the @xmath15 data by stacking all the @xmath15 observations ; however the resulting sky flat - field frame was virtually indistinguishable from the dome flat , and hence was not used .",
    "the iraf  routine mscskysub was used to remove any second - order sky gradients across the field by computing medians in boxes of size 50 pixels and fitting a low - order two dimensional function to the median points .",
    "the residual ` fitted - sky minus sky mean ' is subtracted from each pixel .",
    "we derived astrometric solutions for each chip in the two filters using astrometric calibration exposures .",
    "sa57 is a ( deliberately chosen ) high galactic latitude field where the surface density of bright foreground galactic stars required for astrometric calibration is low .",
    "we therefore observed astrometric calibration fields taken from the astrometric calibration regions ( acrs ) catalogue of @xcite , with star positions typically accurate to @xmath21mas .",
    "we use sextractor   and the wcstools software suite written by d. mink ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to create approximate world co - ordinate system ( wcs ) solutions for each astrometric region in each filter based on stars in the acr catalogues , discarding stars with large proper motions .",
    "the wcs was then refined using the iraf   program ccmap and a tnx projection with a high order polynomial and half cross - terms .",
    "this flexible function was needed to fit the edges of the lfc chips where distortion can be significant .",
    "the plate solution for each filter / chip was then applied to every science exposure using the iraf  mscred tasks , shifting the reference point for the plate solution for each science field using the usno - a2.0 stars ( i.e. there are enough of these stars to calculate a reference point shift , but not to derive a full plate solution ) .",
    "the final solution for each science field is accurate to 0.150.2 , even for the regions of the chips that suffer significant distortion .",
    "each exposure was projected and re - sampled onto a linear wcs , and the individual dither steps at each pointing median - combined after masking cosmic - rays and chip defects to create one final dithered image for each chip , applying multiplicative scaling factors to allow for airmass differences between dithers .",
    "the result is an astrometrically calibrated and photometrically stable combined science image .    at the time the observing program was carried out , the sdss filters were ` non - standard ' , in the sense that few published calibration stars were available . to avoid complex colour terms",
    "needed to place our data on the standard @xmath22-lyrae photometric system , we used standard spectrophotometric stars to calibrate our data . on each night",
    ", two spectrophotometric standard stars were monitored at approximately two hour periods throughout the night to derive airmass - dependent extinction correction terms , augmented by dawn and dusk twilight observations of 45 other spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "our preferred standards were feige 67 and feige 34 .",
    "we calculated the ab magnitude of each standard star in the @xmath0 and @xmath15 filters using the spectrophotometric star spectra energy distributions ( seds ) taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we convolved these seds with the filter and lfc - ccd responses ( c. steidel , private communication ) to calculate the magnitude in a particular filter .",
    "the @xmath15 zero - point was extremely stable with a mean r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of @xmath23mag .",
    "the @xmath0 zero - point was less well - defined , with an r.m.s .",
    "variation from standard star to standard star of @xmath24mag .",
    "due to the accuracy limit to which the spectra of these standard stars are calibrated an accuracy greater than 0.03mag in @xmath0 is probably not achievable ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as an additional consistency check , the overlapping nature of the mosaicing technique allows us to compare magnitudes of objects in different fields , and a night - to - night ( or even year - to - year ) comparison is possible .",
    "we typically find agreement to within 0.02mag in @xmath15 , rising to 0.04mag for the @xmath0 data .",
    "no offsets were seen between the same objects measured on different nights .",
    "object catalogues were created using sextractor  version 2.2.2 .",
    "we used the automatic aperture magnitudes determined by sextractor , similar to kron s ` first moment ' algorithm @xcite .",
    "our high galactic - latitude fields contain a low source - density of objects ( particularly in @xmath0 ) , so crowding on the fields was not a problem and de - blending was rarely required .",
    "a second optical survey of sa57 was conducted using the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and the cfh12k instrument , a large mosaicing camera with an imaging area of 42@xmath19@xmath2528@xmath19 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the observations were carried out on the 25th ( 3/4 night ) and 26th ( 1/4 night ) may 2000 using seven cfht12k pointings to cover the sa57 field .",
    "the first night was photometric , but poor weather on the second night curtailed the program . each pointing comprised two 300s dithered exposures .",
    "@xcite standard star fields were interspersed with the science observations to achieve a photometric calibration of the data .",
    "the data were reduced at the terapix centre using the terapix pipeline reduction software designed for use with the cfh12k camera according to a procedure described in the june 2002 terapix progress report .",
    "an image catalogue covering sa57 was constructed using the sextractor  package and here again we use the automatic aperture magnitudes .",
    "the catalogue is complete to @xmath26 .    finally , we augment the two dedicated observing programs of sa57 with data taken from the digitised palomar sky survey ( dposs ) .",
    "this provides data for both sa57 and a1367 in @xmath27 , @xmath15 and @xmath28 gunn filters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the areal coverage in both fields is 100 per cent , though the data are shallower ( @xmath29 ) and of limited photometric accuracy when compared to the palomar / cfht data , hence we use the dposs data where no other imaging is available .",
    "the optical sources in the various bands are uniquely matched within a search radius of 1.5 .",
    "as in our earlier papers , we use a search radius of 10  to assign optical counterparts from our combined optical data to the foca sources .",
    "the problem of multiple optical counterparts is addressed in section  [ sec : search - more - optical - counters ] .      to consistently inter - compare these new photometric data , we place all the magnitudes onto a system with the same calibration zeropoint .",
    "our imaging data comprises four different calibration systems : the foca system , the vega system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ab system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the gunn system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we compute conversions between the different systems using the seds of vega , bd+174708 ( for gunn magnitudes ) , and appropriate filter and ccd response curves . because of the advantages of a system where magnitudes are easy to interpret physically , we align all of our magnitudes onto the ab system , defined as :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the flux in . for convenience , we list the conversion values between the various original systems to the ab system in table  [ tab : filter_conv ] .",
    ".offsets used to convert the magnitudes to the ab system . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : median_bestfit_bursts ]    our conclusion from this modelling work is that whilst regular sfhs can provide an adequate explanation for approximately half of the sample , they provide poor representations of the remaining galaxies . by relaxing the assumption of a simple sfh , and instead allowing the recent star - formation in the galaxies to evolve according to a simple burst structure ,",
    "these inconsistencies appear to be resolved .",
    "the finding that the sfhs of a substantial fraction of the galaxies in our dataset appear irregular has important implications for surveys that measure sfrs in galaxies via uv measures , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "prior to that analysis , we first examine the results of this survey with other redshift surveys as a consistency check to confirm that the uv - selected galaxy properties make sense within the broader galaxy population .",
    "comparison of the results of this survey with other samples of uv - selected galaxies at low - redshift are not yet possible due to the lack of low - redshift uv observations ( a situation soon to be rectified via the galex experiment ) , and @xmath32-band observations must suffice . however , at higher redshift a comparison is easier as @xmath32-band fluxes are shifted into optical bandpasses .",
    "we compare here with five different samples .",
    "the first , at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , is the emission - line ( ) selected sample of .",
    "next are two high - redshift samples of @xcite ( @xmath35 ) , who observe  fluxes for a sample of @xmath36-band selected cfrs galaxies , and @xcite , who select @xmath37 galaxies using a photometric colour technique .",
    "finally , we show the two @xmath38 samples of @xcite and . for all these samples ,",
    "we take the published  and uv - continuum fluxes , correct for dust using the @xcite prescription if required , and convert to sfrs using our cosmological model and the 2  conversions as appropriate .",
    "the samples are then plotted with the foca data in fig .",

    ", our alternative hypothesis of irregular sfhs can also explain the observations : high  luminosity systems are likely near a peak in sfr , where models predict that  and uv luminosities are at least equal , or should even show an  excess ( as  light increases in a new starburst more rapidly than uv light ) .    below sfrs of @xmath41 ,",
    "the properties of the different samples begin to diverge . as noted in section  [ sec : comp - star - form ] , the uv - selected sample shows a general excess in the uv - derived sfrs .",
    "however , the two @xmath38 samples demonstrate sfrs that agree well , while the -selected sample shows a larger scatter in the derived sfrs , with an  excess at the faint end . once again , a systematic under - estimation in the dust extinction corrections can explain the -excess at the faint end , but this does not explain the uv - excess galaxies . again , all of the results can be consistently interpreted within a framework of non - regular sfhs coupled with the various survey selection criteria : -selected galaxies are likely to be located at a phase in their sfh where they are either near a peak of a starburst ( in galaxies with varying sfhs ) and the -derived sfr is greater than that from the uv , or the galaxies will have regular sfhs and the  and uv sfrs agree well .",
    "the @xmath39 galaxies , with a general optical selection criteria , are likely to represent star - formation across normal hubble types and are less likely to possess the irregular sfhs found in the foca sample which are selected by their uv light .",
    "we examine these ideas further in section  [ sec : impl - cosm - star ] .      the finding that a fraction of the galaxies in our sample do not possess simple sfhs has implications for flux - limited redshift surveys such as this . a galaxy that evolves with an intermittent sfh",
    "will clearly brighten and dim over the course of its history .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig : visi_modelgalaxy_foca ] , where we show the uv evolution of a typical galaxy in our survey and the input sfr(t ) required to produce it , together with the flux limit of the foca survey ( @xmath42 in the ab system ) .",

    "the bursts of star - formation brighten the model galaxy above the uv flux limit into the detectable magnitude range . without this boost , a galaxy",
    "would otherwise not be detected in the uv unless located at a low redshift .",
    "this bias in itself is not serious ",
    "it is one of the goals of this redshift survey to measure an integrated star - formation density , including that fraction of star - formation that occurs in a ` burst mode ' rather than a ` continuous mode ' .",
    "however , a more important bias arises due to the time required for the uv light to die away after a burst has completed , thus leading to higher measured sfrs in the uv or @xmath0 than might be obtained via alternative diagnostic measures , and higher measured sfrs than the ` true ' sfr in the galaxy .",
    "we illustrate this using a model taking into account the flux limit of the foca survey and -selected survey .",

    "an excellent match between the observed galaxy distribution and the simulated galaxies can be seen .    estimating how ` biased ' a determination of the sfr derived from a uv continuum measurement in a particular galaxy is ( i.e. how much this measurement is over - estimated due to recent star - formation activity )",

    "though these parameters can , in principle , be estimated using techniques such as those in section  [ sex : fitting - galaxy - seds ] , this can only be done reliably for a sub - sample of the galaxies  and even then there is a considerable uncertainty in the derived parameters due to the lack of infra - red photometry ( particularly the total stellar mass ) .    instead , we can estimate the effect of the recent sfh in a purely statistical manner based on the entire sample .",

    "this correction is valid over sfrs of approximately 0.1 to 100  for galaxies in this survey selected at 2000 .",
    "whilst similar relational forms likely hold for other redshift surveys , the exact form will depend on the selection criteria and hence the number of galaxies with ` normal ' sfhs admitted into the survey .",
    "even for other uv - selected surveys , selection at a shorter wavelength will be less affected by the effects of starbursts as the uv light dies away more quickly , whilst longer wavelengths could suffer considerable bias .",
    "understanding the precise impact of this bias on analyses such as the madau plot is a complex problem .",
    "the corrections given above are only applicable to individual galaxies , not to the integrated luminosity density of the survey as a whole , as the standard luminosity function @xcite parameters ( @xmath22 , @xmath54/@xmath55 and @xmath56 ) will be affected in different ways by correcting for this effect .",
    "this correction tends to make the sfr in fainter galaxies lower , and hence the appropriate luminosity function slope will be flatter , or @xmath22 will become less negative , likely leading to a slight decrease in the calculated integrated star - formation density .",
    "the luminosity functions and light densities of this sample will be addressed in a forthcoming paper ( treyer , sullivan & ellis , in preparation ) .",
    "the conclusion from this study is that integrated luminosity densities are a poor guide to the complex physical processes at play in these systems .",
    "star - formation densities derived from these measures need to be carefully calibrated , and the effects of different biases at work more fully understood , before the results of flux - limited surveys can be fairly compared .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the results of panoramic wide - field optical imaging of a uv - selected galaxy redshift survey , with the aim of further investigating the nature of star - formation in local @xmath57 star - forming and starburst galaxies .",

    "we have investigated the dependence of the , uv and @xmath0 luminosity to sfr conversion factors on the imf and mass ranges , the stellar metallicity and the time since onset of star formation , assuming constant sfhs .",
    "though varying these parameters can have a large effect on individual conversion values , the effect is smaller when considering ratios of these values ( e.g. uv/ ) .",
    "taking advantage of our new dataset , we update the study of @xcite and compare sfrs derived from uv or @xmath0 and  luminosities . assuming simple sfhs",
    ", we show the scatter and non - unity best - fitting slopes observed are unlikely to be primarily generated by varying the above parameters .",
    "we show that models including a burst or increased period of star - formation superimposed on an otherwise smooth underlying sfh provide much better fits to the data set of @xmath6150% of the galaxies ( , uv and @xmath0 luminosities , balmer break ,  ew and colours ) than a smooth sfh alone .",
    "such burst modes of star formation lead to an overestimate of sfrs derived from uv luminosities in lower luminosity systems , as uv light from less massive stars will still be present after a burst has died away .",

    "<S> we present panoramic @xmath0 and optical ground - based imaging observations of a complete sample of low - redshift ( @xmath1 ) galaxies selected in the ultraviolet ( uv ) at 2000  using the balloon - borne foca instrument of milliard et al . </S>",
    "<S> this survey is highly sensitive to newly - formed massive stars , and hence to actively star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we use the new data to further investigate the optical , stellar population and star formation properties of this unique sample , deriving accurate galaxy types and @xmath2-corrections based on the broad - band spectral energy distributions .    when combined with our earlier spectroscopic surveys , </S>",
    "<S> these new data allow us to compare star - formation measures derived from aperture - corrected  line fluxes , uv(2000 ) and @xmath0(3600 ) continuum fluxes on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis . </S>",
    "<S> as expected from our earlier studies , we find broad correlations over several decades in luminosity between the different dust - corrected star - formation diagnostics , though the scatter is larger than that from observational errors , with significant offsets from trends expected according to simple models of the star - formation histories ( sfhs ) of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> popular galaxy spectral synthesis models with varying metallicities and/or initial mass functions seem unable to explain the observed discrepancies .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the star - formation properties further by modelling the observed spectroscopic and photometric properties of the galaxies in our survey . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nearly half of the galaxies surveyed possess features that appear incompatible with simple constant or smoothly declining sfhs , favouring instead irregular or temporally - varying sfhs . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how this can reconcile the majority of our observations , enabling us to determine empirical corrections that can be used to calculate intrinsic star formation rates ( as derived from  luminosities ) from measures based on uv ( or @xmath0 ) continuum observations alone . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the broader implications of our finding that a significant fraction of star - forming galaxies have complex sfhs , particularly in the context of recent determinations of the cosmic sfh .    </S>",
