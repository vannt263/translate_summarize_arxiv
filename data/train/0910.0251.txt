    "the study of intermediate ( @xmath1m@xmath2 m@xmath3m@xmath4 ) and high - mass ( m@xmath5m@xmath4 ) star formation has made significant progress in recent years , catching up dramatically with our understanding of low mass star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , it appears that stars share many similar formation processes over a wide range of stellar masses . as in the case of low - mass star formation",
    ", outflows have been observed ubiquitously towards forming intermediate and high - mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there exist examples of stars as massive as early b - type surrounded by disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , a key difference between these regimes is that the reduced kelvin - helmholtz contraction timescale of massive protostars results in massive stars reaching the main - sequence while they are still accreting ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "thus , we expect the circumstellar material of these accreting embedded stars to be progressively engulfed by an expanding hii region , and to also be affected by strong stellar winds and radiation pressure",
    ". this fact may provide an explanation for why outflows and disks are not commonly detected towards forming o stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the above processes may be responsible for quickly photoevaporating or dispersing the circumstellar material . however , current observational biases may instead be responsible for the lack of disk detections for the most massive stars .",
    "in this work we aim to provide preliminary studies of a selection of sites containing intermediate- and high - mass star formation , specifically to uncover the presence of ionized gas towards them .",
    "we also wish to study the relationship between the star forming gas , traced by millimeter continuum emission from dust , and the ionized gas created by massive stars , traced by radio continuum emission .",
    "we will select the most promising objects from this study for follow up with higher resolution observations , to map any outflows or disks towards these sources , and to study how the formation of an hii region affects the material within several hundreds of au of the star .",
    "therefore , we have selected sources that are within a declination range suitable for future study with atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and the expanded very large array ( evla ) .    to fulfill these aims ,",
    "we have conducted radio continuum observations at 3.6  cm , using the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory , of 31 clumps detected in previous millimeter continuum observations .",
    "ten sources were selected from preliminary images from the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps , aguirre et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) , and 5 were selected from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b06 ) .",
    "the remaining 16 sources were observed serendipitously , as their positions lay within the observed vla 3.6  cm fields .",
    "note that , in this work , we adopt the terminology that a molecular core produces a single star ( or close binary system ) while molecular clumps form clusters of stars . in our study of massive star forming regions ,",
    "our selected sources are several kiloparsecs away and , thus , we most likely detect clumps forming one or more massive stars along with many lower mass stars .",
    "section [ sourceselect ] presents our selection criteria for the observed millimeter sources .",
    "section [ observation ] provides details of our observations and data reduction .",
    "section [ results ] presents the observed 3.6  cm continuum images of each field ; lists the measured positions , fluxes , and angular sizes of each detected vla source ; compares these results to existing millimeter and mid - ir observations ; and presents derived properties for each source .",
    "our discussion is presented in section [ discussion ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "clumps of molecular gas which are in the process of collapsing to form stars contain dust at temperatures of several tens of kelvin .",
    "this dust is assumed to radiate as a gray body - a black body modified by a frequency dependent opacity , producing emission peaking at sub - millimeter and millimeter wavelengths .",
    "thus observations in the millimeter regime are able to detect possible sites of star formation .",
    "the selected molecular clumps have masses large enough to harbor a forming intermediate or high - mass star , ranging from approximately 50 to 2500m@xmath6 .",
    "sources were chosen from bgps preliminary images and the source list of b06 .",
    "the bgps ( aguirre et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) is a 1.1 mm continuum survey of 150 square degrees of the galactic plane visible from the northern hemisphere , including a contiguous strip from @xmath7 = -10.5 to 86.5 , @xmath8 = @xmath00.5 , as well as selected regions beyond the solar circle .",
    "the survey has a limiting non - uniform 1-@xmath9 noise level in the range 20 and 50 mjybeam@xmath10 rms at a resolution of 33 `` .",
    "the observations of b06 were taken with the 37-channel sest imaging bolometer array ( simba ) on the swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) to identify 1.2 mm continuum emission within a 15 by 6.6 region centered on selected iras sources .",
    "these observations have a resolution of 40 '' .",
    "sources were chosen to have :    1 .   a near distance of @xmath111kpc , for clumps selected from the bgps .",
    "a description of how the bgps clump distances were calculated is given in section [ mmprops ] .",
    "however , hi observations subsequently showed many of the selected bgps clumps to be at the far distance ( see section [ mmprops ] ) . clumps from b06 were selected to have distances given in their table 1 of less than 4kpc .",
    "two of these sources however were also subsequently found to be at the far distance .",
    "2 .   a clump mass greater than 1m@xmath12 at the near distance , with a preference for more massive clumps .",
    "a description of how the bgps source masses were calculated is given in section [ mmprops ] .",
    "masses of b06-selected sources are taken from their table 2 .",
    "little or no associated emission in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 1.4 ghz continuum images and msx e band ( 21.34 @xmath13 m ) images @xcite , suggesting that any massive protostellar objects are young , and/or deeply embedded .",
    "the rms noise in the nvss and msx e band images is 0.45 mjybeam@xmath10 ( in a synthesized beam size of 45 \" ) , and @xmath1413.3 mjysr@xmath10 respectively .",
    "4 .   a declination between -20 and + 40@xmath15 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the lower declination limit of the vla is -48@xmath15 , however , to ensure our observations had a reasonable beam shape , we chose a lower declination limit of -20@xmath15 . to avoid excessive shadowing in alma s compact configurations in follow up studies , we chose an upper declination limit of + 40@xmath15 .",
    "preference was given to sources with no previous vla observations at 3.6  cm that have sensitivities @xmath1630 @xmath13jybeam@xmath10 .",
    "fifteen sources were selected based on the above criteria while another sixteen were serendipitously present within the observed fields .",
    "table  [ selectsrc ] presents these sources , giving their positions ; the velocity of associated @xmath17co galactic ring survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* grs ) emission , if available ; their near and far distances ; the assumed distance ( near or far ) ; the luminosity of associated iras sources ; the millimeter flux ( at 1.1 or 1.2 mm ) ; and the estimated mass of the millimeter clumps .",
    "millimeter clumps that were observed serendipitously are identified by `` serend . '' in column 14 while clumps initially selected are identified by `` select . ''",
    "the determination of the bgps - selected source properties given in table [ selectsrc ] is described in section [ mmprops ] .",
    "b06-selected source properties in table  [ selectsrc ] are taken from their tables 1 and 2 , apart from the exceptions described below .",
    "it was possible to determine the velocities and distances of the clumps towards iras18424 - 0329 and iras18571 + 0349 , using the same methods as for the bgps - selected sources ( outlined in section [ mmprops ] ) .",
    "clumps associated with iras18424 - 0329 were found to be at the far distance ( see section [ mmprops ] ) , and iras18571 + 0349 was assumed to be at the far distance following the results of @xcite .",
    "therefore the values of b06 are appropriately scaled to the far distance for these sources , and the velocity and distances found by the methods in section [ mmprops ] are instead quoted in columns 6 , 7 and 8 of table [ selectsrc ] .",
    "the bgps sources were identified by eye in preliminary bgps images , prior to the final data release ( aguirre et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "several of the sources are not included in the final bgps catalog @xcite , which is designed to minimize false detections , however sources were confirmed by detection of morphologically similar emission in the @xmath17co(j=1 - 0 ) channel maps of the boston university - five college radio astronomy observatory galactic ring survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* grs ) . in order to extract flux densities for our objects , we reprocessed the images using the bgps catalog pipeline , seeding the source identification portion of the catalog with the by - eye positions .",
    "this enabled the catalog routine to extract source properties that directly correspond to the fields observed .",
    "source properties are determined as per the bgps catalog ; the integrated flux densities listed in table [ selectsrc ] are determined using the same method as the flux density @xmath18 in @xcite .",
    "the quoted uncertainties for the integrated flux densities shown in table  [ selectsrc ] are due to the photometry only ; an additional 11% error should be added to account for the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration ( 10% random and 5% systematic , aguirre et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "distances to bgps - selected molecular clumps were determined using velocities of the corresponding @xmath17co emission .",
    "the velocity @xmath19 of each source was measured from the grs @xmath17co channel maps , taking the mean velocity of the associated @xmath17co cloud at the source position .",
    "the distances of the clumps were calculated assuming a flat galactic rotation curve , and circular orbits around the center of the galaxy .",
    "iau values were assumed for the radius of the sun s orbit around the galaxy @xmath20 , and the velocity of the sun around the galaxy @xmath21 ( @xmath22 kpc , @xmath23 kms@xmath10 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "uncertainties of the calculated distances were estimated using a monte carlo simulation , assuming gaussian errors for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the measured velocity @xmath19 .    following a similar method to that outlined in @xcite , distance ambiguities were resolved by examining hi channel maps from the vla galactic plane survey ( vgps , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) towards each source .",
    "two methods of distance determination were used .",
    "firstly , the hi channel maps were inspected for hi self - absorption at the velocity assigned to each millimeter clump .",
    "cool hi in the outer layers of clouds can absorb emission from the warm diffuse galactic hi background ; clouds at the near distance should show hi self - absorption of diffuse hi emission at the far distance , whereas clouds at the far distance will not since there is no background to absorb .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the presence of 21 cm continuum emission from hii regions in the cloud in question can provide a background to absorb even at the far distance .",
    "therefore , a second method of distance determination was employed for sources that displayed hi absorption at the same velocity as the cloud , but also significant 21 cm emission with the same morphology .",
    "this continuum emission can also be absorbed by clouds in the line of sight .",
    "if the cloud is at the near distance , the hi channel maps and profile will exhibit absorption features at velocities only less than that of the cloud , and if the cloud is at the far distance , there will be absorption features present up to the tangent point velocity ( see figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "table[selectsrc ] , column9 , indicates whether the near or far distance has been chosen based on the above methods , indicating whether presence or lack of hi self - absorption ( hisa ) or 21 cm continuum absorption ( ca ) was the deciding factor .",
    "we were able to determine the velocities and distances to the clumps associated with iras18424 - 0329 and iras18571 + 0349 using the above methods , as they have corresponding grs and vgps data .",
    "the clumps toward iras18424 - 0329 were found to be at the far distance .",
    "the distances for the clumps toward iras18571 + 0349 could not unambiguously be determined using the above methods , however hi observations by @xcite found the molecular cloud towards these sources to be at the far distance .",
    "therefore the luminosities and masses quoted in b06 for these sources are accordingly scaled to the far distance .",
    "several of the selected clumps lie within the grs clouds with distance determinations listed in @xcite .",
    "these clouds are : grsmcg029.14 - 00.16 , grsmcg048.59 + 00.04 , grsmcg048.84 + 00.24 , and grsmcg050.29 - 00.46 , which were all determined to be at the far distance , in agreement with our results .",
    "the luminosities of iras sources associated with bgps - selected millimeter clumps ( at the distances given in table[selectsrc ] ) were calculated by first integrating the flux under the four 12 to 100  @xmath24 m iras fluxes , and then adding the integrated flux of a blackbody peaking at 100  @xmath24 m for wavelengths longer than 100  @xmath24 m . when an upper limit was given for any of the four iras fluxes , the upper limit to the integrated flux",
    "was found by integrating under these values , and the corresponding lower limit was then found by setting the fluxes in question to zero before integration .",
    "when two values for the iras luminosity are given in table  [ selectsrc ] , separated by a dash , they denote the lower and upper limits to the luminosity respectively .",
    "uncertainties in the iras luminosity due to the distance uncertainty are not given in table[selectsrc ] , however these can be found by scaling the given luminosities to the upper and lower distance limits .",
    "the masses of the observed bgps clumps were found using the equation    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the gas - to - dust ratio , taken to be 100 , @xmath27 is the integrated flux density , @xmath28 is the clump distance , @xmath29 is the black body function , which is a function of frequency @xmath30 and temperature @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the frequency - dependent opacity .",
    "we have assumed a temperature of 30k for all sources , as a compromise between the dust and nh@xmath33 temperature results of @xcite , who found an average dust temperature from iras emission towards their selection of high - mass stellar objects of 40k , and an average rotation temperature from ( 1 , 1 ) and ( 2 , 2 ) lines of nh@xmath33 of 20k .",
    "following @xcite , we assumed an opacity of 1.14  @xmath34g@xmath10 at 1.1  mm , derived from the results of @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the 1.1 mm flux density vary from @xmath11 10 - 60% .",
    "the temperatures of the observed clumps also may lie between 15 and 60k ( from both nh@xmath33 and dust temperature measurements from * ? ? ?",
    "assuming the rayleigh - jeans approximation holds , mass is approximately inversely proportional to temperature .",
    "therefore the maximum error in the temperature , which is assumed to be 30k , is 100% when t=60k , and will give rise to the same error in the mass .",
    "table  [ selectsrc ] shows that the uncertainty in the clump distances lies in the range 10 - 20% , therefore contributes an error of 40% .",
    "the opacity is uncertain by a factor of two or less @xcite , and the gas - to - dust ratio has been derived , using extinction and gas - phase abundance measurements respectively , to be approximately 100 and 140 @xcite , giving an error of at least 40% .",
    "therefore the calculated masses are accurate to within a factor of approximately 2 , as the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the opacity .",
    "the selected millimeter sources were observed on two occasions with the d  configuration of the national radio astronomy observatory vla , in 3.6  cm ( 8.4  ghz ) continuum mode on 2007 april 6 and on 2007 may 1 , under the program as895 .",
    "vla continuum mode consists of four bands , each having 50  mhz bandwidth ; two of these bands are centered on a frequency of 8.435  ghz , and the remaining two are centered on 8.485  ghz .",
    "the baseline lengths in d array range from 35  m to 1.03  km , resulting in the largest angular scale of observable structure being approximately 3 at 3.6  cm .",
    "however , note this value was lower in some instances due to flagging of the shortest baselines during data reduction .",
    "the average angular resolution of our final images is 8.35 \" .",
    "the on - source integration time for each observation was approximately 30 minutes , which corresponds to a theoretical rms noise of @xmath35jybeam@xmath10 , and @xmath36jybeam@xmath10 in overlap regions of mosaiced fields .",
    "twenty - six antennas were available for the first set of observations , and twenty - five were available during the second .",
    "the data were taken during the transition to the new vla correlator controller , which resulted in there being a larger fraction of data than expected with poor phases or amplitudes that had to be flagged , decreasing the final sensitivity in the images . as well as flagging to remove erroneous data , some of the shorter baselines were flagged to improve the final images , when bright , large - scale structure could not be adequately imaged . the percentage of data flagged for each field ranged from 33 to 47% .",
    "these values include @xmath1110% of the data that was previously flagged by the on - line system .",
    "the pointing centers for most target fields were shifted between the april 6 and may 1 observations ( presented in table [ obssum ] ) .",
    "this was done primarily to move several bright sources on the edge of the vla fields closer to the phase center of the map , to improve image deconvolution . for most of the observations , 1922 + 155 was used as a phase calibrator , with the exception of the source iras 18256 - 0742 , which used 1822 - 096 , and iras 18424 - 0329 and iras 18586 + 0106 which used 1832 - 105 .",
    "the fluxes found during calibration for 1822 - 096 , 1832 - 105 and 1922 + 155 were 1.34 , 1.43 and 0.68  jy , respectively .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package .",
    "the phase calibrator 1922 + 155 was extended , and therefore self - calibration was performed on 1922 + 155 before deriving and applying phase calibration to the target source data .",
    "the primary flux calibrator was 1331 + 305 ( 3c286 ) , which has a flux of 5.23  jy at a wavelength of 3.6  cm .",
    "we used a model of 1331 + 305 for flux calibration , as this source was slightly resolved , allowing data at all uv distances to be used for flux calibration .",
    "the error in absolute flux calibration is approximately 2% .",
    "all of the data , with the exception of iras  18256 - 0742 and iras  18586 + 0106 , were imaged with casa s multi - scale mosaic deconvolution routine , which is based on the clean algorithm , using either three or four scales .",
    "imaging of the remaining two sources was performed using multi - scale clean , as they share the same pointing center in both observations .",
    "panels a ) and b ) of figures [ g44587 ] to [ iras18586 ] present images of the vla 3.6  cm continuum emission tracing ionized gas , and the millimeter continuum emission from the bgps and b06 tracing warm dust , in the 10 observed fields . panel a ) of figures [ g44587 ] to [ iras18586 ] presents the observed vla 3.6  cm fields in grayscale and contours .",
    "panel b ) of figures [ g44587 ] to [ iras18586 ] compares the 3.6 cm images , in contours , to the corresponding bgps 1.1  mm or sest simba 1.2  mm images ( from b06 ) , shown in grayscale .",
    "the bgps 1.1  mm images have been gaussian smoothed using @xmath371.5 pixels .",
    "hereafter , sources selected from the bgps will be quoted in the format g44.587 , as this is sufficient to discriminate between them .",
    "several of the observed bgps sources are close enough to one another to be shown in the same figure ; these are g44.587 & g44.661 , g48.580 & g48.616 , g48.598 & g48.656 , and g50.271 & g50.283 .",
    "the noise in the 3.6  cm images was found not to be gaussian , due to poor uv coverage of extended and very bright emission in the observed fields ( causing stripes in the deconvolved images ) .",
    "therefore an estimate of the noise in the image @xmath38 was taken to be above any residual artifacts .",
    "the 3.6  cm contour levels presented in figures [ g44587 ] to [ iras18586 ] are given in multiples of @xmath38 .",
    "in the 10 observed fields , 35 hii regions are identified , of which 20 are newly discovered .",

    "the integrated flux density was measured using a 1@xmath39 cut - off , within apertures placed so that they included all of the 1@xmath39 contour for each source .",
    "errors in the aperture fluxes were calculated to be a combination of the error due to the image noise over the aperture , and the vla absolute flux error , which is 2% for our observations .",
    "similarly , the peak flux error was found by combining the 1@xmath39 flux density with the vla absolute flux error .",
    "the apertures for source sub - components were unavoidably arbitrary , as they cut across 1@xmath39 contours or higher .",
    "therefore we have provided figure [ polygons ] to show the chosen apertures for sub - sources , denoted by  a , b , c ... \" in table [ vlaresult ] .",
    "in addition to the noise and absolute flux errors mentioned above , which are accounted for and quoted for each sub - component in table [ vlaresult ] , an additional 10 - 20% uncertainty in the integrated flux density should also be included for sub - sources , to account for the arbitrary placing of apertures .",
    "values for the solid angle quoted in table [ vlaresult ] are given for irregular or extended sources only , and are derived from the number of pixels above the 1@xmath39 within each photometry aperture .",
    "for all extended sources , the angular size of the source at the 3@xmath39 level was measured by taking the major axis of the source to be along the direction which it is most extended , to within a position angle of 10 degrees .",
    "the peak and integrated flux densities , the angular size , and the position angle of fully or nearly unresolved sources ( -p ) were determined using the aips task imfit .",
    "the reported peak positions are measured from the peak pixel of the source , except for fully or nearly unresolved sources , whose peak positions are determined from the peak in the fitted gaussian .    due to the removal of some of the shortest baselines ( c.f .",

    "the presence of such a well - defined cluster suggests that these regions are likely to be more evolved ( since multiple zams stars have formed already ) and , indeed , the hii regions tend to be extended and/or complex . yet there is the potential for significantly more star formation to occur , as there are still large amounts of gas ( @xmath111000 - 5000 m@xmath6 ) traced by warm dust emission that are able to continue to form massive stars in the cluster .",
    "given the presence of ongoing massive star formation in these two clusters , their age is likely to be greater than @xmath106 years but less than 3myrs .",

    "these are followed by millimeter clumps associated with singly peaked hii regions , which are likely to be a single star or compact cluster , and finally millimeter clumps with no associated ionized gas emission may provide examples of the youngest sources .    comparing the 1 mm bolocam or sest images with @xmath17co images from the galactic ring survey ( gps ) , we have shown that the emission from these two tracers is correlated , confirming that distance determinations using @xmath17co data can be made for the observed 1 mm clumps .",

    "<S> we find that the ionized gas tends to be associated towards the millimeter clumps ; of the 31 millimeter clumps observed , 9 of these appear to be physically related to ionized gas , and a further 6 have ionized gas emission within 1. for clumps with associated ionized gas , the combined mass of the ionizing massive stars is compared to the clump masses to provide an estimate of the instantaneous star formation efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> these values range from a few percent to 25% , and have an average of 7 @xmath0 8% . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a correlation between the clump mass and the mass of the ionizing massive stars within it , which is consistent with a power law . </S>",
