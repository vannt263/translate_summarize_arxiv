    "as seen in spectra from hires ( vogt 1994 ) on keck , the absorption profiles arising in @xmath0 galaxies exhibit a rich variety of subcomponent structure and kinematic complexity ( churchill , steidel , & vogt 1996 ; churchill , this volume ) .",
    "the key to applying qso absorption line studies to the problem of galaxy evolution hinges upon establishing the connections between absorption  line properties and the components and processes in galaxies that give rise to the absorption .",
    "one simple absorption property is the `` morphological or kinematic shape '' of the profiles , which we explore here .",
    "the status ",
    "quo picture of absorbers is that absorption arises from `` clouds '' spatially distributed throughout galactic halos .",
    "the covering factor of these clouds is inferred to be nearly unity , since intermediate redshift galaxies that lie within 3540  kpc of a qso line of sight rarely fail to exhibit absorption [ steidel 1995 ( s95 ) ] . however , in the present  day milky way , only a @xmath1% covering factor is observed for down to @xmath2   ( bowen , blades , & pettini 1995 ) .",
    "the implication is that either halo clouds may not be the _ primary _ source of absorption or that the spatial distribution of halo gas has evolved substantially from @xmath3 to the present .",
    "we are exploring the theme : `` what you see is what you get '' .",
    "in other words , we examine the hypothesis that the galactic substructures known from local galaxies are sufficient to give rise to the observed variety of absorption profile morphologies . our first goal is to ascertain if models based upon this hypothesis fail to produce simulated profiles similar to those observed .",
    "the two components _ known _ to exist in local galaxies that we explore here are :    1 .   extended and warped disks of spiral / disk galaxies , 2 .",
    "dwarf satellite galaxies associated with typical @xmath4 galaxies .",
    "is associated with down to a neutral column density @xmath5  2 , so one issue is how extended these disks are to this column density .",
    "likewise , we need to estimate the gaseous extent of dwarf satellite galaxies and the number of dwarfs that are associated with a typical @xmath4 galaxy .",
    "we have assumed that no dramatic evolution in the spatial distribution of these absorbing structures has occurred from @xmath3 to the present and have preliminarily explored whether these present  day and familiar components can qualitatively reproduce the morphological shapes and variety of observed absorption profiles .",
    "naively , one would at first expect that highly inclined disk galaxies , observed over the full range of impact parameters , would not frequently give rise to absorption . however , when we account for the increased pathlength and velocity dispersion sampled through an inclined disk , we find that `` clumpy disk '' models yield nearly the same absorption properties as do models of `` clouds '' distributed in a spherical halo [ charlton & churchill 1996 ( cc96 ) ] .",
    "both models yield an effective covering factor of @xmath6% , and so are in apparent conflict with the very small number of non  absorbing galaxies ( only 3/51 ) reported to lie below the @xmath7  kpc `` absorption boundary '' ( s95 )",
    ". however , the survey work of steidel , dickinson , & persson ( 1994 ) reported in s95 is not fully complete .",
    "once their observational selection procedures to date are considered , and the possibility of an occasional absorber misidentification is accounted for , the discrepancy in covering factor between our models and the data may be resolved ( cc96 ) . thus ,",
    "both spherical or disk models are currently consistent with the available data .",
    "we have developed simple tests useful for distinguishing between these two geometries .",
    "these tests rely upon high  spatial resolution imaging of the galaxies and high  resolution spectra of the absorption ( cc96 ) .",
    "we now address `` what you get '' in absorption when you sample lines of sight through a galaxy disk of various orientations .",
    "we designed a monte carlo clumpy disk with empirical properties roughly consistent with those seen in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "we randomly distributed `` absorbing clouds '' in a disk , which we have assumed to be increasing in thickness from 1  kpc to 10  kpc and to have a truncation radius of 50  kpc .",
    "the individual clouds have radii of 1  kpc and number densities given by @xmath8 ( so that the equivalent width @xmath9 ) .",
    "the cloud  cloud velocity dispersions were @xmath10  .",
    "these models were viewed from random orientations at a given impact parameter , and the resulting absorption profiles were sampled every 2  .",
    "the profiles were then convolved with the hires instrumental profile , and poisson noise was added to give a @xmath11 . in figure 1 , we show a series of simulated profiles with increasing impact parameter , which allows qualitative comparison with observed hires spectra ( fig .  1 of churchill , this volume ) .",
    "-2.3 in    we have also found that a series of model disks viewed with increasing inclination ( at fixed impact parameter ) show an increasing spread in subcomponent velocity and a gradual progression toward greater kinematic complexity ( i.e.  blended components separate in velocity space ) .",
    "thus , simulations such as those presented here will yield an orientation test , once high  spatial resolution images of the absorbing galaxies are available .",
    "a major qualitative difference between the simulated absorption spectra from the clumpy disk models and the observed profiles is the presence of `` high  velocity '' weak features in the observed data .",
    "we consider the probability that lines of sight through @xmath4 galaxies may also pass through dwarf satellites , which would give rise to outlying and relatively weak lines . assuming that the gaseous cross section of a satellite is given by @xmath12  kpc",
    ", we computed the mean number of satellites intercepted by random lines of sight at various impact parameters through a milky  way like galaxy in a `` local group '' ( using the actual distances and luminosities of local group members ) .",
    "the overall probability of intercepting a satellite ranges from 0.2 to 0.35 , with the dominant contribution being lmc and smc  like satellites .",
    "how many satellites would be needed to produce a unity probability of interception ? assuming that the luminosity distribution of dwarf satellites can be described by a schechter function with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and that they follow an isothermal spatial distribution between @xmath15  kpc around the primary , we find that that @xmath16 satellites are required .",
    "there are roughly 45 dwarf satellites associated with the milky way that fit these specifications .",
    "thus , evolution in the numbers of dwarf galaxies associated with @xmath4 galaxies would be required if these `` high  velocity '' weak features do arise from dwarf satellites .",
    "if we extrapolate the results of carlberg , pritchett , & infante ( 1995 ) that the number of close pairs increases with redshift as @xmath17 , we find 2530 satellites would be expected per milky way by @xmath18 . if so , an even larger number of `` high  velocity '' absorption lines would be predicted from @xmath19 galaxies .",
    "a simple preliminary clumpy disk model appears to produce simulated profiles remarkably similar to those observed from @xmath20 galaxies . combined with a plausible contribution from satellite galaxies",
    ", we might find that these simulated profiles would also exhibit the higher  velocity weaker features commonly observed .",
    "we strongly caution , however , that this preliminary model is far from unique .",
    "our future efforts will include modeling distributions of clouds in a spherical geometry with various velocity fields ( eg . , rotation , radial infall , and isotropic ) .",
    "if the simulated spectra from familiar local galactic structures and systematic velocity fields match the `` morphological '' and kinematic substructures of observed profiles , then there may not be so much more behind producing absorption than what meets the eye .",
    "it would be fruitful to observationally confirm if higher ",
    "velocity weaker features are actually produced by satellite galaxies and to establish if the orientation effects expected from disks are seen .",
    "such a study would depend upon deep high  spatial resolution images ( roughly 2030 ) of the galaxies for which hires spectra are available .",
