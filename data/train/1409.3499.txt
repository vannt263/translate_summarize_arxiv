    "cellular responses to environmental fluctuations often involve biochemical reactions that are intrinsically stochastic .",
    "for example , stochasticity ( noise ) plays an important role in processes leading to gene expression  @xcite and in biochemical switching between distinct states  @xcite .",
    "regulation of noise in these processes is critical for the maintenance of cellular functions as well as for the generation of phenotypic variability among clonal cells .",
    "quantitative modeling of mechanisms of noise regulation is thus a key step towards a fundamental understanding of cellular functions and variability .",
    "noise regulation in cells is typically implemented by regulatory proteins such as transcription factors ( tf ) .",
    "recent research has demonstrated that , at the single - cell level , regulatory proteins are often produced in bursts  @xcite .",
    "such proteins can further be involved in autoregulation ( e.g. the tat regulatory protein which controls the latency switch of hiv-1 viral infections )  @xcite or in downstream regulation of biochemical switches ( e.g. switching of flagellar rotation states in bacterial chemotaxis )  @xcite .",
    "some interesting questions arise from these observations : how does feedback from proteins produced in bursts regulate noise in gene expression and biochemical switching ?",
    "how can gene expression parameters be tuned to optimize noise in the presence of bursting and feedback ?",
    "the aim of this letter is to address these questions by developing a gene expression model that combines bursting and feedback for which we obtain the exact stationary distribution .",
    "previous work on noise in gene expression has focused on exact analytical solutions for models with : a ) bursting but no feedback effects @xcite or b ) feedback effects but no protein production in bursts @xcite .",
    "similarly , previous work on noise - induced biochemical switching @xcite does not consider the case of input noise source produced in bursts . in this letter , we introduce a _",
    "model that addresses these gaps in the field .",
    "our model reduces to multiple previously studied models in limiting cases .",
    "we obtain exact analytical distributions that significantly extend previously obtained results and lead to new insights .",
    "* model : * a schematic representation of the model is shown in fig.[fig : model ] . here 0 and 1 represent the inactive and active state of the promoter , respectively .",
    "note that the terms inactive / active are simply used to label the two states since protein production can occur from either state .",
    "specifically , protein production from the inactive ( active ) state occurs with rate @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "each production event results in a random burst of proteins and we assume that these bursts are distributed geometrically with mean size @xmath2 .",
    "the degradation rate of proteins is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the rate of switching from active to inactive state is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the rate at which the inactive state switches to the active state has two contributions : the spontaneous contribution with rate @xmath5 , and the feedback contribution , with rate @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the number of proteins , and @xmath8 measures the strength of the feedback ) .",
    "the linear dependence on @xmath7 for the feedback term is consistent with experimental characterization of the genetic circuit for expression of hiv-1 tat protein @xcite .    .",
    "rate of transition from inactive to active state is @xmath9 , and that from active to inactive is @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) for @xmath10 the model maps onto a two - state switch driven by a bursty input source.,width=321 ]    since we allow protein production from both active and inactive states , the model can be used to analyze the effects of positive feedback as well as negative feedback .",
    "when @xmath11 , the feedback term enhances protein production leading to positive feedback . in contrast , @xmath12 leads to negative feedback . for @xmath13 ,",
    "protein production is independent of the promoter state . as indicated in fig .",
    "1b , the model then corresponds to a bursty input noise source controlling switching between the two states .",
    "thus the same model can be used to analyze the impact of input protein noise on the statistics of a simple two - state switch @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the probability to find , at time @xmath15 , the promoter in state @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath7 proteins in the cell .",
    "the temporal evolution of @xmath14 is given by the following master equations @xcite : @xmath18p_{0,n},\\nonumber\\\\ \\partial_t p_{1,n}&=&k_1\\sum_{p=0}^ng(p)p_{1,n - p}+\\mu ( n+1)p_{1,n+1}\\nonumber\\\\&+&(\\alpha+\\tilde{\\alpha}n ) p_{0,n}-[k_1+\\beta+\\mu n]p_{1,n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the protein burst distribution .",

    "this solution for the generating function is the central result of this paper .",
    "it can be shown that our result reduces to previously obtained results in different limiting cases ( supplementary information ) .",
    "it can be used to derive exact analytical results for several quantities of interest .",
    "for example , the steady - state probability that the promoter is in state @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is given by ( see supplementary information ) @xmath36}{{_2f_1}[u , v , u+v+1-w,1-\\phi]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , eq.([solution ] ) can be used to obtain an analytical expression for the protein steady - state distribution @xmath37 and to analyze the corresponding moments .",
    "these expressions lead to quantitative insights into multiple topics of current research interest as discussed below .",
    "* regulation of protein noise : * there has been considerable focus in previous work on analyzing the effects of feedback on the noise @xmath38 characterizing the protein steady - state distribution @xcite . to analyze the impact of feedback , we first compare the noise for the case with feedback ( @xmath39 ) to the case without feedback ( @xmath40 ) in fig.[fig : fig2](a , b ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that negative feedback increases the noise when compared to the case without feedback : @xmath41 . on the other hand",
    ", positive feedback leads to a decrease of noise @xmath42 . while this may appear surprising given previous results @xcite , this observation is consistent with recent results from simulations @xcite .",
    "it should be further noted that negative feedback leads to a reduction in mean levels whereas positive feedback increases mean levels ; thus the changes in @xmath43 can be driven largely by changes in the mean levels .",
    "it follows that to determine the effects of feedback on noise , it is desirable to compare models which give rise to the same mean levels .     as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath8 for a ) negative feedback ( @xmath44 ) and",

    "other parameters are : @xmath47.,width=340,height=226 ]    to address this issue , we introduce an effective model with no feedback that is characterized by a _ constant _",
    "rate @xmath48 for promoter switching from the inactive to active state .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 is determined analytically ( supplementary information ) by the condition that the mean protein levels @xmath49 and @xmath50 are identical in the original and effective models .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as in the original model . in the following ,",
    "we compare noise in protein distributions for the original and effective models .",
    "fig.[fig : fig2](c , d ) illustrates the ratio @xmath46 for negative as well as positive feedback . for negative feedback ,",
    "protein noise in the original model is lower than the noise in the effective model , i.e. the effect of negative feedback is to reduce noise . for positive feedback , as shown in fig.[fig : fig2]d , we observe that feedback increases the noise when compared to the noise for the effective model .",
    "thus , in the context of regulation of protein noise , the results obtained indicate that the choice of reference model plays a critical role . in relation to the model without feedback , we observe that negative ( positive ) feedback increases ( decreases ) the noise .",
    "however , in relation to the effective model , which preserves the average number of proteins , the opposite behaviour is observed .",
    "fig.[fig : fig2](c , d ) also indicates that the effective model provides a useful approximation to the original model for a wide range of parameters , in particular for positive feedback . in this case , for the range of parameters considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](d ) , the effective model provides a good approximation in regions of parameter space for which a ) @xmath51 or b ) @xmath52 . in the former case ,",
    "fluctuations in protein levels make a negligible contribution to the promoter switching rate , whereas the latter condition represents ( almost ) constitutive production of protein bursts , making the effective model indistinguishable from the original model .",
    "however , there is a class of problems for which the effective model is inadequate and it is necessary to analyze the complete model .",
    "an important example includes noise optimization in the presence of feedback by varying system parameters , as discussed in the following .",
    "* noise minimization : * recent work @xcite has analyzed noise minimization due to negative feedback for a model similar to the one outlined in fig .",
    "1 . in this model ,",
    "the binding of a tf switches its promoter to a repressed state , ( i.e. set @xmath53 ) and the switching rate @xmath4 corresponds to the dissociation rate of the tf from its promoter . in the limit @xmath54 , there is no feedback , since proteins bursts are effectively produced constitutively with rate @xmath0 . to examine noise minimization , the system parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4",
    "are varied subject to the constraint that the mean protein number @xmath49 is held fixed .",
    "in particular , it is of interest to determine : a ) the minimum dissociation rate , @xmath55 , required for negative feedback to result in a reduction of noise relative to the model with no feedback .",
    "b ) the optimal rate @xmath56 at which noise suppression is maximal . in the following ,",

    "3 illustrates the variation of protein noise @xmath43 as a function of tf dissociation rate @xmath4 , keeping the mean protein levels fixed by changing the transcriptional rate @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath54 ( i.e no feedback )",
    ", we have @xmath57 .",
    "as @xmath4 is reduced , the noise initially decreases , reaches a minimum value at @xmath58 and subsequently increases .",
    "in contrast , for the corresponding effective model with a constant rate of promoter transitions ( as defined in the preceding paragraphs ) , we have @xmath59 for all finite @xmath4 , i.e. there is no noise reduction .",
    "this indicates that it is essential to consider the role of fluctuations in the rate of promoter transitions ( from active to repressed state ) in understanding noise reduction due to negative feedback .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 can be determined by the condition that for @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 . the exact expression for @xmath43 in combination with some approximations , specifically @xmath62 ,",
    "can be used to derive the result obtained in @xcite for @xmath63 ( supplementary information ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that this rate corresponds to @xmath64 which implies that for noise reduction , the rate of tf dissociation must be greater than the rate of arrival of nonzero bursts of proteins .",
    "our results can also be used to analyze the optimal value @xmath65 at which noise suppression is maximal .",
    "the results derived in @xcite using moment - closure approaches serve as a good approximation in the limit of large @xmath49 .",
    "since our exact results apply for arbitrary parameter values , they can be used to connect large @xmath49 results with those for low @xmath49 .",
    "as discussed below , this analysis leads to some interesting observations .     for @xmath66 .",
    "corresponding variations for the optimal dissociation rate @xmath56 and the probability @xmath50 are plotted for different values of @xmath49 in the inset , dotted lines representing the prediction of ref .",
    "other parameters are : @xmath67.,width=207,height=151 ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the optimal value of dissociation rate @xmath56 is linearly dependent on @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 remains constant as @xmath49 is varied by changing @xmath0 . as expected , we recover this feature when @xmath49 is large ( see fig .",
    "however , for small @xmath49 we see a strong deviation from the large @xmath49 limit , characterized by non - monotonic variation .",
    "furthermore , this non - trivial variation in the optimal dissociation rate is also reflected in the probability of the promoter state being transcriptionally active , @xmath50 .",
    "as shown in the figure , @xmath50 decreases monotonically with @xmath49 and in the limit of large @xmath70 it approaches the result derived in ref .",
    "thus our results predict that , for optimal noise suppression in low abundance tfs , the fraction of time that the promoter is active decreases as we increase tf concentration .    * switching statistics : * as noted in fig .",
    "1b , when @xmath71 , the model analyzed can be mapped to a two - state system driven by a _",
    "bursty _ input signal .",
    "several cellular systems can be modeled ( at a coarse - grained level ) as two - state switches ; thus it is of interest to explore how such switches respond to fluctuating inputs  @xcite .",

    "the quantity of interest is the variance of the switch , @xmath72 , with @xmath50 given by eq.([ep0 ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , previous work @xcite has considered the case such that each burst leads to creation of exactly one protein ( i.e. protein dynamics is a simple birth - death process ) .",
    "remarkably , there exists a mapping between the analytical solutions in these two cases ( supplementary information ) . using this mapping , we obtain the following exact result for the problem considered in previous work @xcite @xmath73.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as expected , the above expression , eq.([ep02 ] ) , reduces to analytical results derived in @xcite ( for @xmath74 ) in limiting cases .",
    "for example , in the slow switching limit , i.e. @xmath75 , eq . ( [ ep02 ] ) leads to @xmath76 , which is identical to the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the fast switching limit @xmath77 , if we further set @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 , consistent with the result obtained in @xcite . the exact result derived above , eq.([ep02 ] ) , allows for analysis of switching statistics beyond these limits , i.e. throughout parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the results derived can be used to explore how bursty protein production affects switching statistics .",
    "fig.[fig : switch]a shows how the switch variance @xmath81 depends on the burst size , @xmath2 , and the average number of proteins , @xmath68 .",
    "some interesting observations can be made which highlight the nontrivial variation of @xmath81 with bursting . for large @xmath49 values",
    ", @xmath81 shows a non - monotonic variation with @xmath2 , with a maximum at a critical burst size , @xmath82 ( see fig.[fig : switch]b ) . on the other hand , for low @xmath68 , we observe that @xmath81 decreases monotonically with @xmath2 with the maximum corresponding to @xmath83 ( fig.[fig : switch]b ) .",

    "the model developed can also be applied to study the statistics of a simple two - state switch driven by a bursty protein noise source .",
    "our results show that such bursty input noise can induce strong deviations in the optimal parameters for switch variance from the corresponding mean - field predictions .",

    "here we illustrate how we can map a model with arrival of proteins in geometric bursts to a model for which each arrival leads to the production of a single protein .",
    "first , consider the geometric burst distribution conditional on the production of at least one protein ( i.e. ignore bursts which do not result in the production of any proteins ) .",
    "if the original burst distribution has mean @xmath2 , then the generating function of the corresponding conditional geometric distribution is given by @xmath142 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the mean of the conditional geometric distribution is @xmath143 .",
    "if we now take the limit @xmath144 for the conditional geometric distribution , this corresponds to the case in which exactly one protein is produced in every burst .",
    "thus the simple poisson arrival process can be recovered as a limit of the model with arrival of _ conditional _ geometric bursts .",
    "now we note that the model described in fig .",
    "1b can be equivalently viewed from two perspectives : ( i ) geometric bursts ( with mean @xmath2 ) arriving at rate @xmath145 or ( ii ) conditional geometric bursts ( with mean @xmath146 ) arriving with rate @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the probability that the burst produces at least one protein .",
    "thus the steady - state solution obtained in the main text is also the solution for a model with arrival of conditional geometric bursts .",
    "based on this observation , the results obtained also lead to exact results for models with conditional geometric bursts , using the mapping @xmath149 carrying out this mapping and taking the limit @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) leads to the exact result for the problem considered in previous work @xcite .",
    "using eq . ( 9 ) , expression for the mean number of proteins is @xmath151 where @xmath152}{_2f_1[u , v , c,1-\\phi]},\\ ] ] @xmath153 and expressions for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) . similarly , using eq . ( 3 ) , the exact expression for the protein noise can be written as a sum of two terms @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the noise contribution when proteins are produced constitutively , i.e. in the limit of @xmath156 , and @xmath157\\ ] ] is the noise contribution due to promoter switching , and @xmath158 is given as @xmath159 _ 2f_1[u+2,v+2,c+2,1-\\phi ] } { _ 2f_1[u+1,v+1,c+1,1-\\phi]^2}-1.\\ ] ] it is interesting to note that when the transition rate from the state 0 to 1 is a constant , the second term @xmath160 is a positive definite quantity and leads to monotonically increasing noise with decreasing @xmath4 . however , in the presence of feedback , the second term can be positive or negative or zero . the value of finite @xmath4 where @xmath161 corresponds to @xmath150 , which we wish to find .",
    "this is the minimum value of @xmath4 which marks the beginning of noise suppression due to negative feedback .      to proceed further",
    ", we need to determine how @xmath0 varies with @xmath4 , given the constraint that @xmath49 is held fixed .",
    "this can be simplified by making the mean - field approximation : @xmath164 in combination with the exact equation @xmath165 .",
    "defining @xmath166 , the preceding approximation gives us @xmath167 . substituting this in eq .",
    "( [ eb6 ] ) , we obtain the solution @xmath168 this is identical to the result derived in @xcite .",
    "the preceding analysis highlights the assumptions needed to obtain this result from the exact results derived in the main text .",
    "the derivation also shows that we have @xmath169 the right - hand side of the above equation represents the rate of arrival of non - zero bursts of proteins at steady - state .",
    "thus the minimum dissociation rate has to be greater than the rate of arrival of non - zero bursts of protein production",
