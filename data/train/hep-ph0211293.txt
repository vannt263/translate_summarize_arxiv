    "the weak n-@xmath0 transition amplitudes yield important information about the structure of the nucleon and the @xmath0 , and in particular about the role of chiral mesons since they explicitly enter in the expression for the axial part of the weak current .",
    "there exist only very few calculations in quark models @xcite yet none of them includes the mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be traced back to the difficulty of incorporating consistently the pion field which is necessary to describe the correct low-@xmath2 behaviour of the amplitudes .",
    "obviously , this can be done only in the models that properly incorporate the chiral symmetry .",

    "we study some general properties of the axial amplitudes in quark models that include the pion and possibly also its chiral partner , the @xmath5-meson .",

    ", if the meson self - interaction is absent in the model , i.e. if the pion interacts only with quarks , the pion contributes solely to the @xmath6 form - factor while the @xmath7 and@xmath4 form - factors pick up only the contribution from quarks . in most quark models",
    "the nucleon and the @xmath0 are calculated as localized states while the expressions for the amplitudes require states with good linear momenta . in sec .",
    "5 we use the wave packet formalism to derive corrections to the amplitudes calculated between localized states and show that the approximations are valid for momenta that are small compared to typical baryon masses . in sec .",
    "6 we give explicit expressions for the axial as well as the strong form - factors in the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) and make a simple estimate of their strengths .",
