    "integral quantum hall effect in a planar electron system is a beautiful manifestation of topological effects in physics .",
    "whenever the fermi level is in an energy gap , the quantized hall conductance is known to be a topological invariant at the microscopic level .",
    "@xcite for example , in a periodic system the hall conductance for a filled band is the chern number over the magnetic brillouin zone which is topologically a torus , @xcite usually called the tknn invariant named after its discovers . for a lattice system with edges",
    ", the hall conductance can be written as another topological invariant for the complex energy surface which is normally a higher - genus riemann surface .",
    "@xcite ( there is a close relationship between this invariant and edge states @xcite , which we are going to exploit in this paper . ) thus the quantization of hall conductance is expected to be stable against weak disorder and perturbations unless some topological change , e.g. gap closing , occurs .",
    "@xcite when the gap is reopened , usually there is a discrete change in the hall conductance .",
    "such a hall plateau transition due to gap collapse is an example of the so - called quantum phase transitions , which recently attracts some theoretical attention .",
    "@xcite    for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider the model of non - interacting electrons on a square lattice , with both nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hoppings , in a uniform magnetic field with rational flux , @xmath1 , per plaquette .",
    "in general , the one - electron spectrum is split into bands .",
    "if the fermi level is in a gap between two bands , the hall conductance is quantized . at some special values for hopping parameters , the gap may close ,",
    "leading to a hall plateau transition .",
    "@xcite one approach to study such transitions is to use effective field theory .",
    "the basic idea is that in the neighborhood of gap closing points , energy - momentum dispersion is generally linear , corresponding to the appearance of massless dirac fermion(s ) .",
    "thus the large - distance behavior of the system near the transition can be described by an effective field theory with dirac fermions , in which the gap closing and reopening are represented by sign change in fermion masses .",
    "( a similar situation is the anyon mott transition near the fermion point , which has been studied in this way in ref .",
    "usually one is tempted to include into the effective theory only the massless fermions that appear when the gap closes ; it is these fermions whose dirac mass may change sign across the transition .",
    "indeed , it has been generally shown that counting only these massless dirac fermions at the transition point will give us the correct value for the discrete jump in hall conductance across the transition .",
    "@xcite also only the massless dirac fermions contribute to the critical exponents for the transition .",
    "@xcite however , as we will see , this does not guarantee that the hall conductance before and after the transition can be correctly reproduced .",
    "in other words , the topological nature of the hall conductance dictates a matching condition for the large - distance effective field theory to be consistent with the microscopic lattice formulation .    to see the necessity of such consistency conditions",
    ", we note that the contribution of a planar massive dirac fermion to hall conductance is known to be plus or minus one - half in units of @xmath2 , with the sign depending on the sign of dirac mass .",
    "therefore , the change in hall conductance is always an integer , when a number of fermion masses change sign .",
    "but , if an odd number of dirac masses change sign across the transition , which is possible as we will see below in a numerical example , the hall conductance either before or after the transition is half - odd - integer , in conflict with the integer quantization as required by the microscopic topological arguments .",
    "thus a certain number of massive dirac fermions , whose masses do not change sign across the plateau transition , must be present in the effective field theory .",
    "we will call such fermions as spectators , since really they do not participate in the phase transition because they remain massive at the transition point . however , they are there in the effective theory , not only ensuring the hall conductance to be integral , but also , added to the non - triviality of the problem , ensuring that the integral value of the hall conductance before or after plateau transition to be the _",
    "correct one _ as dictated by the microscopic topological invariant .",
    "so the number of species of these massive `` spectators '' can not be arbitrary ; it needs to be determined from first principles .",
    "previously the necessity of the existence of massive `` spectator '' fermions has been noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite in some simple and specific models for phase transitions to quantum hall states . here",
    "we will discuss a general prescription and a concrete procedure for determining all the massive spectators in more complicated models with arbitrary rational flux per plaquette .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in the next section , we briefly review the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional dirac fermions , the associated zero mode and resulting contribution , @xmath3 per species , to hall conductance , providing arguments for the necessity of having massive spectators in the theory . in sec .",
    "iii , we propose a general prescription for determining the number of massive spectators , i.e. counting the number of `` vortices '' in the magnetic brillouin zone for the highest filled band near the transition .",
    "a concrete procedure in which we find vortices by edge states is introduced . to exemplify",
    ", we use a tight binding hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hoppings to illustrate our procedure .",
    "iv is devoted to exhibiting numerical results in this model , showing how our procedure works when gap closing occurs near certain critical value of the nnn hopping parameter .",
    "the existence of massive spectators is clearly demonstrated in the example . finally in sec .",
    "v we summarize our results and discuss relationship of our hall - conductance matching condition to precedents in the literature on matching topological property for theories at small and large distances .",
    "first let us briefly review the hall conductance for a system of planar dirac fermions in the effective field theory , with `` relativistic '' energy - momentum relation , which becomes linear for the massless case .",
    "this quantity can be extracted from a simple calculation of the `` vacuum - polarization '' diagram for the photon propagator with a fermion loop .",
    "this one - loop diagram is superficially divergent , a certain regularization is needed .",
    "then , the one - loop integral becomes finite even before removing the cut - off , with the result @xcite @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the dirac mass for species @xmath6 .",
    "it has been shown that if the fermions remain massive , there is no correction to the one - loop value of @xmath0 from higher orders .",
    "@xcite other derivations without computing diagrams can be found in references @xcite .",
    "here we present an argument @xcite which does not involve any diagram and regularization explicitly .",
    "the hamiltonian for a planar `` relativistic '' fermion of species @xmath6 in a static , uniform , perpendicular magnetic field is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are spatial components of covariant derivative , satisfying @xmath10= ie\\hbar b$ ] , @xmath11 is the magnetic field strength , and @xmath12 are pauli matrices .",
    "the spectrum for a single species at @xmath13 is symmetric with respect to zero and is given by @xmath14 which is gapless when @xmath15 , and is unbounded both from below and from above .",
    "when @xmath16 , relativistic landau levels are given by @xmath17    note that there is a zero - mode ( [ eq : spec_withb ] ) labeled by @xmath18 , which depends on the sign of fermion mass .",
    "for the vacuum state , whether this mode is filled or not depends on the sign of mass : filled if @xmath19 , and not if @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath15 , there is a charge conjugation symmetry for this species . in the mean time , the vacuum is doubly degenerate , with the zero - mode filled or not filled . in the continuum field theory ,",
    "this ambiguity can not be resolved .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a fermion - number fractionalization occurs if one assumes charge conjugation symmetry : the fermion number of the doubly degenerate vacuum is either @xmath21 or @xmath22 depending on whether the zero mode is filled or empty .",
    "similarly for the hall conductance , we may argue that since the contribution of the filled zero - mode is always unity ( in units of @xmath2 ) , charge conjugation symmetry requires that the vacuum with or without the zero - mode filled should have fractional contribution @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "now let us add an infinitesimal mass to the fermion to remove the vacuum degeneracy .",
    "obviously for the vacuum state , the zero - mode is filled if @xmath23 , and empty if @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we obtain the value of @xmath0 to be @xmath25 , depending on the sign of mass .",
    "when there are several species of fermions , the hall conductance is given by a sum of their individual contributions , as in eq.([eq : dirac_hall ] ) .",
    "therefore , if the mass of a species changes sign across a plateau transition , it gives rise to a change in hall conductance by unity .",
    "so to account for the change in hall conductance , one only needs to look for massless fermions at the transition .    however , it is easy to see that if the number of massless fermions is odd at the transition , their total contribution to hall conductance before or after the transition is a half - odd integer .",
    "if this gives the total hall conductance , it is in conflict with integral quantization of hall conductance implied by the tknn topological invariant .",
    "one may wonder perhaps this would never happen , similar to the no - go theorem of nielson and ninomiya @xcite in @xmath26-dimensions , which asserts that in the continuum limit of a lattice theory the number of massless chiral fermions must be even .",
    "if a similar theorem could hold also in the @xmath27-dimensional case , perhaps the number of massless dirac fermions must be even .",
    "unfortunately , it is not the case : no such no - go theorem exists in @xmath27-dimensions .",
    "moreover , in sec .",
    "4 we will show a numerical example , in which gap closing occurs clearly at three isolated points in the magnetic brillouin zone , corresponding to three ( no more and no less ) massless fermions .    thus if the low energy spectrum of the system consists of unpaired ( massless ) fermions , there must be massive fermions present in the `` high - energy '' sector of the theory .",
    "these massive fermions remain massive during the transition and , therefore , do not participate in the hall plateau transition , in the sense that their contribution to hall conductance does not change across the transition . therefore they are `` spectators '' of the transition .",
    "but their existence restores the integral quantization of hall conductance before or after the transition .",
    "@xcite in the next section we will discuss the general principle , as well as a practical procedure , to determine the number of species of the `` hidden '' massive fermion spectators from microscopic information .",
    "for definiteness , let us consider a tight - binding hamiltonian on a square lattice with both nn and nnn hoppings . in the landau gauge , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the annihilation operator for a lattice fermion at site @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the magnetic flux per plaquette @xmath31 is rational , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath1 with mutually prime integers @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the hall conductance in this case is a bulk quantity which is described by the tknn topological integer @xcite .",
    "it is written as the chern number of a @xmath34 fibre bundle over the magnetic brillouin zone as @xmath35_z , \\label{eq : chern}\\ ] ] @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a normalized bloch function of the @xmath38-th energy band , with @xmath39 @xmath40 labeling its components .",
    "( see references for precise definitions .",
    "@xcite ) an important observation here is that the magnetic brillouin zone @xmath41 is topologically a torus rather than a rectangle . since the torus does not have a boundary , application of stokes theorem to eq.([eq : chern ] ) would give @xmath42 if @xmath43 is well defined on the entire torus @xmath41 .",
    "a possible non - zero value of @xmath0 is a consequence of a non - trivial topology of @xmath43 . in order to better understand the relevant topology ,",
    "let us examine the effect of a phase transformation of the wavefunction @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an arbitrary smooth function of @xmath46 over the brillouin zone .",
    "the corresponding gauge transformatin for @xmath43 is @xmath47 which clearly leaves @xmath0 invariant .",
    "the non - trivial topology arises when the phase of the wavefunction can not be determined uniquely and smoothly in the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the gauge transformation defined above implies that the overall phase of the wavefunction can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "it can be determined , for example , by demanding the @xmath33-th component of @xmath48 to be real . however",
    ", this is not enough to fix the phase over the brillouin zone , when @xmath49 vanishes at some points .",
    "let us denote these zeros by @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and define small regions around the zeros by @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "we may adopt a different phase convention in @xmath54 so that another component , say , @xmath55 , is real .",
    "( we denote it by @xmath56 ) . then the overall phase is uniquely determined on the entire brillouin zone @xmath41 . at the boundaries , @xmath57",
    ", we have a phase mismatch @xmath58 by using the above formulas for gauge transformation , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gt1 ] ) , ( [ eq : gt2 ] ) , we have @xmath59 here @xmath60 must be integers since each of the states vectors must fit togther exactly when we complete full revolutions around each @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that the zeros of a certain component of the bloch function define vortices in the brillouin zone , whose integral vorticities contribute to the hall conductance .",
    "while the phase of the wavefunction depends on phase convention ( gauge choice ) , the total vorticity is a gauge invariant quantity . in this way , in principle , counting the total vorticity of the @xmath34 phase of the bloch wavefunction gives the bulk hall conductance . but this would need the knowledge of ( explicit or numerical ) wavefunctions in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "a more practical prescription to obtain the vortices of the bulk states is proposed in refs . @xcite and @xcite , which are summarized as follows .",
    "this method exploits a relationship between two closely related systems .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in @xmath62-direction .",
    "but in @xmath63-direction , we consider two possible boundary conditions separately : the periodic and fixed ones .",
    "using the periodic boundary conditions in both directions and taking the infinite size limit , one can obtain a bulk system ( without edges ) . by using the fixed boundary conditions in @xmath63-direction",
    ", one can consider a cylindrical system with edges in that direction . in this case , by a fourier transformation in @xmath62-direction , we obtain a one - dimensional tight - binding equation with parameter @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 this difference equation can be written as    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the following @xmath69 transfer matrix @xmath70 then the spectrum is completely governed by a product of @xmath33 transfer matrices , @xmath71 , given by @xmath72 in the following , for simplicity , we assume @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 to be a multiple of @xmath33 . the boundary conditions are @xmath76 and we set @xmath77 to fix the normalization .",
    "the one - dimensional system ( [ eq:1dhmlt ] ) has a period @xmath33 .",
    "thus as @xmath78 , part of the spectrum converges to @xmath33 energy bands which are determined by the condition @xmath79 this corresponds to the on - shell condition in usual scattering theory .",
    "further , for the cylindrical system , there are additional eigen energies , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , satisfying @xmath82 so that @xmath83 . for each @xmath84 ,",
    "the condition ( [ eq : cnd_band ] ) is not satisfied . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding state is localized near either @xmath85 or @xmath86 , depending on the value of @xmath87 : @xmath88 so this is an edge state , whose energy lies in the @xmath38-th gap .",
    "note that for such state , the above equation implies @xmath89 on the other hand , if @xmath90 , the condition ( [ eq : cnd_band ] ) is satisfied , implying that the edge state is in touch with an energy band edge .",
    "then the above equation ( [ eq : edge_cond ] ) tells us that the corresponding @xmath91 , together with @xmath92 or @xmath93 depending on which ( top or bottom ) egde it is of the energy band , gives a zero of the bloch function @xmath94 in the brillouin zone . in this way , each time when the edge state becomes degenerate with a bulk state at band edge occurs , we find a zero of the @xmath33-th component of the bloch wave function for that band , which gives a desired @xmath34 vortex in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chern ] ) .    how to determine the vorticity associated with each vortex found in this way ?",
    "a useful and practical rule is proved in ref .",
    "@xcite : when the degeneracy occurs at the top of a band and the edge state jumps from the right edge to the left ( or the opposite way from the left edge to the right ) with increasing @xmath64 , the vorticity is @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 ) .",
    "similarly , when the degeneracy occurs at the bottom of a band , the vorticity is just opposite to the previous case . in fig",
    "[ f : ex ] , a typical example of the degeneracy between an energy band and edge state is shown .",
    "the energy of an edge state that is localized at the right edge is drawn by a solid line and the one at the left edge by a dotted line .",
    "since there is one and only one edge state in the @xmath38-th gap , we may trace its energy @xmath97 as @xmath91 vareis from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , and define a winding number ( around the @xmath38-th gap ) associated with the edge state by adding all the vorticities at its degeneracy points .",
    "( geometrically indeed this number can be realized @xcite as the winding number of the loop traced by @xmath97 around the @xmath38-th hole on the complex energy riemann surface for eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dhmlt ] ) . )",
    "it is amusing that this winding number is exactly the contribution of the @xmath38-th band to the hall conductance . in this way , a direct relationship between the bulk hall conductance and the behavior of the edge state is established .",
    "we will exploit this relation to find the vorticities of the bulk bloch states . as will be discussed in the next section ,",
    "our rule is simply _ to assign a dirac fermion to each vortex associated with the edge state _ in the gap relevant to the plateau transition .",
    "in the model with only the nn hopping , it is known that there are zero modes when @xmath33 is even @xcite .",
    "there are @xmath33 zero modes and the dispersion is linear in momentum near these zero modes . as far as the low energy physics is concerned , when the fermi energy is near zero , we may treat the system as that of dirac fermions . the energy dispersion for @xmath100 case is shown in fig  [ f : dirac](a ) .",
    "there are four energy bands and the two of them near @xmath101 are degenerate where the linear dispersion is clearly observed .",
    "dirac fermions also appear in the nnn model @xcite .",
    "for example , in fig  [ f : dirac](b ) , the spectrum for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 is shown . in this case",
    ", there are three energy bands and the two higher energy bands are degenerate at three momenta , corresponding to three massless dirac fermions .    in general , there are @xmath33 gap closing points in the nnn model with @xmath103 .",
    "deviation of @xmath105 from @xmath106 brings a mass term in the energy dispersion . the formula ( [ eq : dirac_hall ] ) tells that one dirac fermion carries the hall conductance @xmath107 depending on the sign of its mass . for an even number of dirac fermions ( as shown in fig  [ f : dirac](a ) ) , eq.([eq : dirac_hall ] ) always gives an integer @xmath0 . on the other hand , if @xmath33 is odd , according to eq.([eq : dirac_hall ] )",
    ", these @xmath33 dirac fermions associated with the gap closing points will give a half - integer value for any kind of combination of signs in the mass terms .",
    "it would break the integral quantization for the hall conductance of the non - interacting fermions , if no massive dirac fermions are introduced . indeed , as will be shown below , for example for the case of fig  [ f : dirac](b ) ) , there is in addition a massive dirac fermion , corresponding to a vortex not passing through any of the gap closing points . though it is a `` spectator '' for this hall transition .",
    "it helps restore the integeral hall conductance .    in fig .",
    "[ f:1o3 ] , the energy bands , edge states , and the corresponding vortices of the nn model are shown where the white circles denote @xmath95 vorticities and the black ones denote @xmath96 vorticities . in figs .",
    "[ f : edges1o3 ] , the same things are shown for the nnn model for several @xmath105 s .",
    "one can see how the second energy gap closes and then opens again .",
    "the energy dispersions near the gap closing are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : edges1o3 ] ( d ) for @xmath108 and fig .",
    "[ f : edges1o3 ] for ( e ) @xmath109 , where there are three almost linear dispersions in the second energy gap .",
    "the exact linear dispersion is realized at @xmath110 .",
    "thus the dirac fermion are massive in the cases of figs .",
    "[ f : edges1o3 ] ( d ) and ( e ) . further by comparing fig .",
    "[ f : edges1o3](c ) and fig .",
    "[ f : edges1o3](d ) @xcite , one can see that the sign of the mass is reversed after the gap reopening .",
    "near the gap closing ( appearance of the massless dirac fermions ) at the three different momentum points , there are three vortices as shown in the figs  [ f : edges1o3 ] .",
    "the vortices moves between the lower band and the higher band during the process .",
    "it explains the change in the hall conductance .",
    "what is crucial to our point is that there is an additional vortex near the @xmath111 point , where there is a large energy gap .",
    "though the shape of the energy dispersion is quite different from that of a dirac fermion , it does not prevent us from including the effect of this vortex as a dirac fermion with a large mass term in the effective field theory , since its only role in the theory for the hall transition is to reproduce the correct value of the hall conductance@xcite .",
    "this is the hidden `` spectator '' which restores the integral quantization of hall conductance . in short ,",
    "it is the existence of the vortices rather than their energy dispersion that defines all relevant dirac fermions appearing in the effective theory , including massive spectators .",
    "note that when one changes the parameters of the model , the dirac fermions associated with vortices in the magnetic brillouin zone are always created in pairs . for example , in figs .",
    "[ f : edges1o3](a ) and ( b ) , between @xmath112 and @xmath113 , a pair of dirac fermions are created near @xmath111 .",
    "two fermions move toward the gap closing points at @xmath114 and @xmath115 and there they go across the energy gap when the gap closes ( figs .",
    "[ f : edges1o3](a)-(g ) ) . in summary , for the effective theory of this quantum hall transition , we should have three massless dirac fermions and one massive spectator with positive mass .",
    "we have shown that in general one needs to add massive fermions ( spectators ) into the effective field theory in orde to get correct integral hall conductance .",
    "the number of spectators is not arbitrary , since the hall conductance is dictated by the microscopic tknn topological invariant .",
    "therefore , one needs to consider the `` high - energy '' sector or the microscopic details of the system , in order that the hall conductance in the low - energy effective field theory at large distances should be the same as in the high energy microscopic model at small distances .",
    "this matching condition , required by topological considerations , establishes a connection between theories of the same system at large and small distaces . in the models with noninteracting electrons on a planar lattice",
    ", we have given the principles and a practical procedure for determining the number of massive species of fermion spectators from microscopic information .",
    "numerical examples are shown for the validity of our prescription and for the implementation of our practical procedure .    to conclude this paper",
    ", we would like to point out the relationship of our present problem to its precedents in the literature on topological investigations in quantum field theory . from the point of view of the latter , the hall effect in a planar system ( or in 2 + 1 dimensions ) can be expressed by a chern - simons effective action , obtained by integrating out the electrons in the system , for the external electromagnetic field : @xmath116 whose variation with respect to @xmath117 gives us the ( hall ) current in the system induced by the external field .",
    "( here @xmath118 . )",
    "there is a well - known formal relationship @xcite between this action and famous axial anomaly equation in 3 + 1 dimensions : @xmath119 here non - conservation of the axial current , @xmath120 , is expressed in terms of the gauge field that couples to the vector current .",
    "one observes that the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) can be viewed , up to numerical factors , as the surface term of an integral of the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomaly ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising to find similarities between our present problem and some known examples related to the axial anomaly in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the first example we like to mention is the thooft s anomaly - matching condition .",
    "@xcite in 3 + 1 dimensions , chiral fermions give rise to axial anomaly , which is known to be of topological origin .",
    "if this anomaly exists at the fundamental constituent level , thooft has argued that it must survive at large distances even in theories in which the massless fermions are confined ( like quarks ) and do not show up at large distances .",
    "this requirement , i.e. the axial anomaly in the effective theory at large distances should match that in the fundamental theory at small distances , imposes constraints on the spectrum of the effective theory at large distances . in certain cases , massive `` spectators '' may be needed to satisfy this condition . in our problem , what plays the role of axial anomaly is the hall conductance in 2 + 1 dimensions . the lattice theory we start with is the miscroscopic theory and the effective field theory is the one at large distances .    in certain sense , the nielson - ninomiya `` no - go '' theorem for unpaired massless chiral fermions in the continuum limit of a lattice theory constitutes another counterpart of our problem in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the basic argument for this `` no - go '' theorem is again the necessity of matching , in the continuum limit , the vanishing axial anomaly in the lattice theory .",
    "therefore , our present problem can be viewed as a 2 + 1 dimensional version of the above two problems for matching topological properties for theories of the same system at small and large distances .",
