    "in the past several years , many new excited charmed baryonic states have been discovered experimentally .",
    "for example , belle collaboration observed an isotriplet of new states @xmath0 decaying into @xmath15 , and they tentatively identified the quantum numbers of these states as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the neutral state @xmath16 was possibly confirmed in the @xmath17 channel by babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , the measured mass @xmath18 for @xmath16 is @xmath19 higher ( assuming gaussian statistics ) than the belle s measured value , and babar indicated that there is weak evidence that the excited @xmath20 observed by them is @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , babar collaboration reported the observation of a new charmed state @xmath1 decaying to @xmath22 with a mass of @xmath23 and an intrinsic width of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , belle collaboration confirmed it in the @xmath25 decay and measured its mass and width to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the experimental observations have triggered theorists great interest in understanding the internal structures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "one direct way of theoretical studies grounds on the assignments of them as conventional charmed baryons . from a relativized potential model prediction ,",
    "masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are close to theoretical values of @xmath28 with @xmath6 or @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 or @xmath32 , respectively @xcite . in the relativistic quark - diquark picture ,",
    "ebert _ et al .",
    "_ suggested @xmath0 as one of the orbital ( @xmath33 ) excitations of the @xmath34 with @xmath5 , @xmath35 , or @xmath29 , and proposed @xmath1 as the first radial excitation of @xmath34 with @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "strong decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as charmed baryons were analyzed in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite , with the @xmath37 model @xcite , and using the chiral quark model @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , garcilazo _ et al .",
    "_ indicated that @xmath0 would correspond to an orbital excitation with @xmath5 or @xmath35 and @xmath1 may constitute the second orbital excitation of the @xmath38 by the faddeev method . in a mass loaded flux tube model , chen _ et al . _",
    "suggested that @xmath1 could be the orbitally excited @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "another different way bases on the assumption that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are some molecular candidates . lutz _",
    "interpreted @xmath0 as a chiral molecule @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 was deciphered as a dynamically generated resonance with a dominant @xmath3 configuration .",
    "et al . _ pursued a possible hadronic molecule interpretation of @xmath0 as a bound state of the charmed @xmath41 meson and the nucleon @xmath42 , since isotriplet states of @xmath0 are very close to respective @xmath3 thresholds @xcite .",
    "they chose several possible quantum number assignments of @xmath0 as @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath5 corresponds to a @xmath2-wave @xmath3 configuration , @xmath45 and @xmath36 represent a @xmath46-wave , and @xmath6 has a relative @xmath41-wave in the @xmath3 system .",
    "they finally concluded that @xmath47 decay widths are consistent with current data for @xmath45 and @xmath6 assignments . coming down to @xmath1 , it was firstly proposed to be a @xmath2-wave @xmath48 molecular state with @xmath5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , because its mass is just a few @xmath49 below the @xmath48 threshold . from an effective lagrangian approach ,",
    "the strong two - body decay of @xmath1 was studied under the @xmath5 and @xmath50 @xmath4 molecular assignments , and it showed that @xmath5 should be ruled out @xcite .",
    "later , the radiative and strong three - body decays of @xmath1 were also researched in the @xmath4 molecule picture with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "systematically studied the interaction between @xmath51 and @xmath42 , and concluded that the @xmath4 systems may behave as @xmath43 and @xmath44 states @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , garca - recio _ et al .",
    "_ found a possible molecular candidate for the @xmath1 in the @xmath35 channel .",
    "_ studied @xmath1 as a @xmath4 molecule with @xmath6 in a constituent quark model , and claimed obtaining a mass which agrees with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "although various interpretations to @xmath0 and @xmath1 were put forward , at present their underlying structures are still unclear , which means that it is interesting and significative to make more theoretical efforts to reveal their properties .",
    "therefore , we devote to studying that whether @xmath0 and @xmath1 could be the @xmath2-wave @xmath3 state with @xmath5 and the @xmath2-wave @xmath4 state with @xmath6 , respectively . qcd is widely believed nowadays to be a true theory of strong interactions . at high energy ,",
    "the effective coupling constant of the quark - gluon interaction becomes small because of asymptotic freedom and the interaction can be treated perturbatively . on the other hand ,",
    "quark interaction within hadrons is strong since it binds quarks into unseparable pairs .",
    "thus , low energy qcd involves a regime where it is futile to attempt perturbative calculations , and the strong interaction dynamics of hadronic systems is governed by nonperturbative qcd effects completely .",
    "there are still many questions on nonperturbative qcd remain unanswered or realized only at a qualitative level since one s absence of knowledge on qcd confinement effects .",
    "therefore , it is quite difficult to calculate the hadron spectrum from qcd first principles .",
    "the method of qcd sum rules @xcite , developed by shifman , vainshtein , and zakharov , represents an attempt to bridge the gap between the perturbative and nonperturbative sectors by employing the language of dispersion relations .",
    "it is well known for the advantages of this method : instead of a model - dependent treatment in terms of constituent quarks , hadrons are represented by their interpolating quark currents and the interactions of quark - gluon currents with qcd vacuum fields critically depend on the quantum numbers ( spin - parity , flavor content ) of these currents .",
    "the qcd sum rule method is a nonperturbative formulation firmly based on the first principle of qcd , which has become a widely used working tool in hadron phenomenology .",
    "the mere fact that the seminal paper on qcd sum rules have already been cited more than @xmath52 times reflects its vigorousness .",
    "it has been successfully applied to conventional mesons and baryons ( for reviews see @xcite and references therein ) and multiquark states ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , many theoretical practitioners began to study light pentaquark states in refs .",
    "@xcite and heavy pentaquark systems in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we intend to investigate that whether @xmath0 and @xmath1 could be the @xmath2-wave @xmath3 state with @xmath5 and the @xmath2-wave @xmath4 state with @xmath6 respectively from qcd sum rules .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follow .",
    "we derive qcd sum rules for molecular states in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , with similar techniques as our previous works on heavy baryons @xcite and molecular states @xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , and masses of @xmath53 and @xmath54 molecular states are extracted out .",
    "[ sec4 ] contributes to the conclusions .",
    "one basic point of qcd sum rules is to construct a proper interpolating current to represent the studied state . in the real world , one hadron in particular a molecular state can not be an ideal point particle in a rigorous manner because each constituent quark of a hadronic system is separated in the space . without doubt",
    ", it would be best if one could describe a real hadron using some nonlocal current in qcd sum rules .",
    "however , the practitioners can find that it would become quite difficult or even unfeasible for qcd sum rule calculations when a hadron s current is constructed nonlocal .",
    "thus , interpolating currents used in qcd sum rules are commonly built local to characterize real hadrons , which is in fact a limitation inherent in the qcd sum rule method disposal of hadrons .",
    "the simplification has been widely proved feasible and the qcd sum rule method has been successfully applied to plenty of hadrons , involving a number of works on molecular states since the observations of so - called  x \" ,  y \" , and  z \" new hadrons in recent years ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". following the usual treatment , in this work we will construct molecular currents from local operators of hadrons . at present ,",
    "molecular currents are built up with the color - singlet currents of composed hadrons to form hadron - hadron configurations of fields , which are different from currents of pentaquark states constructed by diquark - diquark - antiquark configurations of fields .",
    "although molecular currents can be related to pentaquark currents by fierz rearrangement , the transformation relations are suppressed by corresponding color and dirac factor .",
    "consequently , it would be best to choose a hadron - hadron type of current to characterize if the studied object is a molecular state .",
    "therefore , currents for @xmath2-wave @xmath53 or @xmath54 molecular states can be built up with the color - singlet currents of @xmath55 or @xmath56 mesons and @xmath42 nucleons to form meson - nucleon configurations of fields .",
    "in full theory , interpolating currents for @xmath55 and @xmath56 mesons can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and currents for nucleons have been listed in ref .",
    "therefore , we build following forms of currents : @xmath57 for the @xmath2-wave @xmath3 or @xmath12 molecular state with @xmath5 , and @xmath58 for the @xmath2-wave @xmath4 or @xmath14 molecular state with @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath59 is heavy quark @xmath60 or @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , as well as @xmath64 denote light quarks @xmath65 and/or @xmath66 . the index @xmath67 means matrix transposition , @xmath68 is the charge conjugation matrix , with @xmath69 , @xmath61 , @xmath60 and @xmath70 as color indices .",
    "beside @xmath6 , one may have noted that the quantum number for a @xmath2-wave @xmath4 molecule could also be @xmath71 .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to construct the interpolating current for the @xmath2-wave @xmath4 molecule with @xmath5 from meson - nucleon configurations of fields . that s the main reason why the @xmath2-wave @xmath4 molecule with @xmath5 has not been involved here .",
    "in addition , it showed that the molecular assignment of @xmath1 with @xmath5 should be ruled out from an effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",

    "note that @xmath103 corrections may be important in the qcd sum rule calculations .",
    "meanwhile , one could expect the calculations of @xmath103 corrections especially for multiquark systems are complicated and tedious as one has to deal with many multi - loop massive propagator diagrams .",
    "actually , a lot of hard calculations already need to be done even if one merely works at leading order since there include many feynman diagrams up to dimension @xmath7 . however , it is expected that the @xmath103 corrections might be under control since a partial cancelation occurs in the ratio obtaining the mass sum rules ( [ sumrule1 ] ) and ( [ sumrule2 ] ) .",
    "this has been proved to be true in the analysis for heavy mesons @xcite ( the value of @xmath104 increases by @xmath105 after the inclusion of the @xmath103 correction ) and singly heavy baryons @xcite ( the corrections increase the calculated baryon masses by about @xmath106 ) .",

    "one could take input parameters as @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 @xcite . to choose proper work windows for the threshold @xmath76 and the borel parameter @xmath83",
    ", one could consider two rules in the standard qcd approach : on one hand , the perturbative contribution should be larger than condensate contributions to have a good convergence in the ope side ; on the other hand , the pole contribution should be larger than the continuum state contributions in the phenomenological side .",
    "besides the above two restrictions , the threshold parameter @xmath128 should not be taken arbitrarily .",
    "it is known that the first excitation of studied state defines the size of @xmath129 , and @xmath129 should be higher than the extracted value @xmath75 of studied state around @xmath130 for many hadrons . taking the case of @xmath3 state as an example , if @xmath129 were taken as @xmath131 , one could obtain the mass @xmath132 .",

    "however , it may have some difficulty to find a conventional work window critically satisfying all the above rules in this work , which has been discussed in detail for some other cases , e.g. refs .",
    "the main reason is that some condensate contributions are very large , making the standard ope convergence ( i.e. perturbative contribution at least larger than each condensate contribution ) to happen only at very large values of @xmath83 . for the case of @xmath2-wave @xmath3 state with @xmath5 as an example",

    "thus , one could try releasing the rigid ope convergence criterion ( i.e. , that the perturbative contribution should be larger than each condensate contribution ) and restrict the ratio of the perturbative to the  total ope contribution \" ( the sum of the perturbative and other condensates calculated ) to be at least larger than one half or more .",
    "what is also very important that we have found that condensates higher than dimension @xmath7 are quite small , and they could not radically influence the character of ope convergence here .",
