    "magnetic fluids ( or ferrofluids ) are colloidal dispersions of single domain nanoparticles in a carrier liquid .",
    "the fascination of ferrofluids stems from the combination of a normal liquid behaviour with the sensitivity to magnetic fields .",
    "this enables the use of magnetic fields to control the flow of the fluid , giving rise to a great variety of new phenomena and to numerous technical applications @xcite .",
    "one of the peculiarities of ferrofluids is the mutual influence of the microstructure and the rheological properties of the fluid . due to strong interparticle interactions various aggregates",
    "can be formed in a ferrofluid @xcite . on the one hand , the formation of the aggregates changes the effective viscosity of the fluid . on the other hand , the motion of the fluid influences the structure of the aggregates .    in an applied magnetic field chains containing several particles",
    "are the favored form of an aggregate and are formed by the dipolar interactions .",
    "there is a similarity between the chains of dipoles and the macromolecular chains in polymer solutions . in both systems",
    "a network of chains is coupled with a viscous carrier liquid .",
    "this viscous coupling implies , that the relaxation character of the chain dynamics leads to a viscoelastic behaviour of the solution .",
    "the viscoelastic behaviour is reflected in a dependence of the stress tensor on the history of the system .",
    "the theoretical treatment of the viscoelasticity of polymer solutions is usually based on a phenomenological model .",
    "there are three well known models for an isotropic linear viscoelastic liquid . in the maxwell model",
    "a viscoelastic element is a combination of a purely elastic spring with a purely viscous dashpot . in the bingham two - component model",
    "these elements are connected parallel to each other , and the jeffreys element is a superposition of the two previous ones .",
    "a comprehensive review of the theoretical basics and the existing models was done by bird in refs .  .",
    "an overview of the theoretical approaches to the polymer dynamics is given by doi and edwards @xcite .",
    "a ferrofluid with chains in a magnetic field is an anisotropic system .",
    "this makes it similar to a nematic liquid crystal ( nlc ) , whose rheology can be described by a group of models usually referred as ericksen - leslie - parody ( elp ) models .",
    "the stress tensor in refs .   involves five independent viscosity coefficients , which are scalar functions of the density and the temperature .",
    "elp models are widely used in the hydrodynamics of nlc .",
    "these models were employed in the analysis of a flow instability @xcite and in studying periodic patterns @xcite . in these papers as well as in refs .",
    "the influence of an external field was taken into account .",
    "readers who are interested in a deeper insight into elp models are referred to the books of de gennes @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "since the susceptibility of ferrofluids is much higher than that of liquid crystals , the effects caused by external field should be more pronounced .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the rheology of a colloidal suspension containing ellipsoidal particles in a field was performed by pokrovskij in refs .. the model gives a constitutive equation of the elp kind , where the viscosity coefficients are expressed in terms of the parameters of the suspension and the applied field .",
    "electro- and magnetorheological fluids present a group of suspensions , whose behaviour is close to that of ferrofluids .",
    "the viscoelastic properties of electro- end magnetorheological fluids were studied experimentally in refs .. particularly it was shown that external fields can influence the rheological response of the fluid by changing the complex shear modulus and yield stress .",
    "zubarev and iskakova @xcite used the results of refs .   to obtain a constitutive equation for a ferrofluid with chains for the case of a weak flow of any kind . in the present paper",
    "the model suggested in ref .",
    "is applied to the linear stability analysis of the faraday instability .",
    "the faraday instability denotes the parametric generation of standing waves on the free surface of a fluid subjected to vertical vibrations .",
    "the study of this phenomenon dates back to the observations by faraday @xcite in 1831 .",
    "the initially flat free surface of the fluid becomes unstable at a certain intensity of the vertical vibrations of the whole system . as a result of the instability ,",
    "a pattern of standing waves is formed at the fluid surface .",
    "the typical response is subharmonic , i.e. , the wave frequency is half the frequency of the excitation .",
    "a harmonic response can be observed on a shallow fluid at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "faraday waves allows one to investigate symmetry breaking phenomena in a spatially extended nonlinear system",
    ". therefore they experience a renewed interest in recent years .",
    "detailed experimental studies of the various patterns on a viscous fluid have been performed @xcite , where a one - frequency as well as a two - frequency forcing were applied . among the observed patters are parallel rolls @xcite , hexagons @xcite , a twelvefold quasi - pattern @xcite , triangles @xcite , superlattices formed by small and large hexagons @xcite , squares @xcite , and rhomboid pattern @xcite .    the comprehensive linear stability analysis of the faraday instability on an arbitrarily deep layer of a viscous non - magnetic fluid has been performed by kumar and tuckerman @xcite .",
    "this analysis was tested experimentally @xcite and an excellent agreement between the predicted and experimental data was found . in refs .",
    "the low frequency region is studied particularly .",
    "bicritical points , where transitions from one type of response to others occur , are predicted and experimentally confirmed @xcite . in ref .",
    "an analogy between the faraday instability and a periodically driven version of the rayleigh - taylor instability is exploited .",
    "based on that analogy in ref .",
    "a scaling law is suggested , which satisfactorily describes the behaviour of the system in a wide range of parameters .",
    "s. kumar @xcite discusses the mechanism of the wave number selection in the faraday instability on high - viscous fluids .    in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the faraday instability on a chain - free ferrofluid was studied .",
    "a nonmonotonic dependence of the stability threshold on the magnetic field is found at high frequencies of the vibrations .",
    "it was revealed that the magnetic field can be used to select the first unstable pattern of faraday waves . in particular , a rhombic pattern as a superposition of two different oblique rolls can occur .",
    "the faraday instability of a viscoelastic non - magnetic liquid was studied experimentally in ref .  , where a harmonic response was detected . in refs .",
    "the maxwell model of viscoelastic liquid was used in the theoretical analysis .",
    "the authors observed pronounced changes in the neutral stability curves .",
    "particularly , the tongues related to the harmonic response became abnormal .",
    "such a tongue has no tip and all tongues of higher order are inside this abnormal tongue .    the aim of the present paper is to investigate the role of the chains in the faraday instability on a ferrofluid in a horizontal magnetic field .",
    "the formation of the chains leads to a dramatic increase of the magnetization relaxation time , changes the effective viscosity of the suspension , and increases the susceptibility of the ferrofluid .",
    "a number of model ferrofluids are investigated in a wide range of the parameters of the system to study the relative importance of those effects .",
    "a dielectric , viscous , and incompressible magnetic fluid with constant density @xmath0 is considered , which contains particles of the equal size .",

    "interactions between chains can be neglected . assuming that the chains are straight and rigid , zubarev and iskakova determined the size distribution of chains , which minimizes the free energy of such a magnetic fluid and is given by @xcite :    @xmath12    @xmath13/(2y ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the volume of a particle and @xmath15 . each chain containing @xmath16 particles",

    "the former is known due to the classical langevin model and the latter is the solution of the fokker - planck equation ( see refs .  ) .",

    "the total stress tensor @xmath47 reads    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the pressure , and @xmath51 the induction of the magnetic field .",
    "the above model is used to analyze the stability of the free surface of a ferrofluid in the following setup .",

    "the fluid motion is governed by the continuity equation and the conservation law of the linear momentum    [ gov ] @xmath57 & = \\partial_jt_{ij}^{(2)}-\\rho g(t)\\delta_{i,3},\\quad i=1,2,3 . \\label{navier}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the vertical vibrations add a periodic term to the gravity acceleration @xmath58 , i.e. , a modulated value @xmath59 appears in the equations of the fluid motion . here",

    ", it is necessary to expand all quantities in taylor series .",
    "the above defined distribution functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 are affected by the small perturbations . since the formation and the dissociation of chains",
    "are connected with the diffusion of particles in the suspension , they are rather slow processes",
    ". it can be estimated by the schmidt number @xmath70 which relates the characteristic time for mass transport by flow to the characteristic time for mass transport by diffusion . for a typical ferrofluid",
    "the schmidt number is about @xmath71 with @xmath72 kg/(ms ) , @xmath73 kg / m@xmath74 , and the brownian diffusion coefficient @xmath75 m@xmath76/s @xmath77@xcite .",
    "therefore we neglect the changes in @xmath68 caused by the perturbations .",
    "this implies that the size distribution of chains does not depend either on the spatial coordinates or on time . in refs .",
    "only spatially homogeneous systems are considered .",
    "an extension to the case of a spatially inhomogeneous system results in additional convective terms in the dynamic equations for @xmath69 [ eq .  ( 12 ) in ref . ] .",
    "since these terms are of the form @xmath78 , i.e. , they are of second order with respect to the perturbations , they can be neglected in a linear stability analysis .",
    "as long as the typical length scale of a chain ( @xmath79 m ) is smaller than that of the spatial variation of the perturbations ( typically @xmath80 m ) , zubarev s model can be applied in the present setup .",
    "our results ( see sec .  [ results ] ) suggest that this condition is always fulfilled .",
    "the symmetry of the system possesses a number of restrictions on @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the change of @xmath81 to @xmath82 and @xmath83 to @xmath84 should not change the components @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , whereas this transformation leads to the change of a sign of the components @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "this completes the set of the moment equations derived from the fokker - planck equation @xcite , and gives us the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "the functions @xmath98 are obtained by means of averaging ( with function @xmath34 ) over the orientations of chains and averaging over the sizes of the chains ( with function @xmath68 ) .",
    "thus , the set of governing equation for the first order of the perturbations can be written :    [ gov_lin ] @xmath99    here @xmath100 is the perturbation of the induction of the magnetic field .",
    "the linearized boundary conditions differ from those in ref .   by the condition for continuation of the stress tensor across the free surface of the fluid    @xmath101    where @xmath102 .",
    "in contrast to the previous case @xcite , the first two equations in ( [ bound_lin ] ) are independent of each other .",
    "the stability of the flat surface with respect to standing waves is analyzed by using the floquet ansatz for the surface deformations and the @xmath83-component of the velocity    [ floquet ] @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the wave vector , @xmath105 is the growth rate , and @xmath106 is the parameter determining the type of the response . for @xmath107 the response is harmonic whereas for @xmath108 it is subharmonic .",

    "the condition of reality for @xmath56 leads to the equations @xcite    [ reality ] @xmath111    inserting the ansatz into the governing equations ( [ gov_lin ] ) , we obtain a set of algebraic equations for the amplitudes of all perturbed quantities . the solvability condition for this set",
    "gives us four values of the modified wave vector @xmath112 .",
    "hence , the general solution of the set of governing equations in the ferrofluid contains eight arbitrary constants .",

    "for the chosen set of parameters in fig .",
    "[ tongues ] the fourth tongue becomes exceptionally deformed , since it has no tip and no upper boundary in the way all other tongues have .",

    "the maximal contribution to @xmath218 comes for @xmath227 hz from chains off the maximum of @xmath68 .",
    "comparing the area under the @xmath214- , @xmath222- , and @xmath224-curve in fig .",

    "[ ef_visc](a ) describing the weaker dissipation of energy in the system .",
    "the origin of the viscoelasticity ( i. e. , the dependence of the relation between the tensors of velocity gradients and the stress tensor on the history ) in a ferrofluid with chains can be explain in the following way .",
    "when the orientation of a chain is changed from the equilibrium by the velocity gradients , a restraining moment is generated by the applied field .",
    "thus the network of chains is an `` elastic '' element of the system , which interacts with the viscous carrier liquid .",
    "if the relaxation time of a chain is much shorter than the period of the vibrations , the orientation of chains and consequently the rheological properties of the suspension do not depend on history , and there is no viscoelastic properties .",
    "this fact becomes more obvious , if one notes that the relaxation time of a chain is proportional to the carrier liquid viscosity .",
    "thus the negligible relaxation time of a chain implies a weak coupling between the chain and the carrier .    to estimate the importance of the relaxation processes in a ferrofluid with chains ,",
    "the deborah number @xmath229 is calculated for the subharmonic response .",
    "the deborah number is the product of the angular wave frequency with the mean relaxation time of a chain , @xmath230 . in the case of polymer solutions",
    ", the most pronounced viscoelastic behaviour should be expected in the range of @xmath231 , whereas at @xmath232 a recovery of the newtonian behaviour was observed @xcite . in the case of ferrofluids with chains , the viscoelastic behaviour is present over a much wider @xmath229 range . the frequency range of fig .",
    "[ ef_visc ] gives @xmath233 for which a viscoelastic behaviour is present since @xmath234 .",
    "that fact is supported by the range of appearance for the abnormal tongues considered to be a characteristic feature of viscoelastic behaviour . from fig .",
    "[ discon ] one can read that viscoelastic properties can be expected even for @xmath229 beyond @xmath235 .    obviously the viscoelasticity of a ferrofluid with chains differs from that of a polymer solution .",
    "the reason for this difference is the following .",
    "the relaxation time of a long polymer chain involved in the polymer dynamics is the conformational relaxation time .",
    "as soon as the period of excitation becomes much shorter than the conformational relaxation time , the polymer chain does not participate in the movement of the solution .",
    "therefore a motion of the newtonian solvent through the rigid obstacles of polymer chains is observed . in the case of the rather short chains formed by magnetic particles ,",
    "the relaxation time is the orientational relaxation time of a chain @xcite in the viscous carrier liquid . since it is proportional to the viscosity of the carrier liquid , the high values of @xmath194 and @xmath229 , respectively , mean a strong coupling between the motion of a chain and the carrier liquid , which ensures the viscoelastic behaviour .",
    "thus ferrofluids widen significantly the range in which viscoelastic features can be observed in contrast to polymer solutions .    in a real ferrofluid , any variation of the system parameters not only varies the deborah number but also affects the critical parameters either directly or indirectly by changing other properties as permeability or viscosity . in order to investigate the role of the deviations of the chains from equilibrium in greater detail , a model ferrofluid with a tunable coefficient of rotational diffusion for all chains @xmath236 is studied . via that coefficient the mean relaxation time @xmath194 , i.e. the deborah number , can be varied .",
    "@xmath237 is a phenomenological parameter , which is related neither to the    : @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath166 : @xmath240 , @xmath132 , and @xmath203 : @xmath241 , @xmath242 .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as before .",

    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ deborah ] that even small deviations from equilibrium are significant as the variation of @xmath125 and @xmath124 in the range from @xmath247 to @xmath248 show . in the case of a system with long chains ( @xmath249 ) , a pronounced minimum in the dependence of @xmath250 and a maximum in that of @xmath251 are observed . as @xmath117 and the mean chain length decrease ,",
    "these extrema are shifted towards higher values of de and become less pronounced and disappear for @xmath241 . beyond @xmath252",
    "one observes a saturation of @xmath125 and @xmath124 close to the corresponding extremal values .",
    "that means that beyond a certain deviation from equilibrium , viscoelastic effects can neither be enhanced nor diminished .",
    "the latter confirms that there is no recovery to a newtonian behaviour at high @xmath229 numbers .",

    "the dependencies of the critical acceleration amplitude @xmath124 and the critical wave vector on the excitation frequency @xmath228 , the magnetic field @xmath253 , and the dipolar coupling constant @xmath117 have been obtained for different depths of the layer in a wide range of fluid viscosities .",
    "a viscoelastic behaviour is predicted , which is indicated by the qualitative changes in the neutral stability curve : an abnormal tongue appears which has no tip and upper boundary in contrast to all other tongues ( fig .",
    "[ tongues ] ) . beside its existence",
    "it is revealed how this abnormal tongues is formed by the merging of other tongues as the viscosity of the carrier liquid is changed ( fig .  [ transitions ] ) .",
    "the threshold of the instability depends on the applied field and on the angle @xmath176 between the wave vector and the applied field separately ( fig .",
    "[ angle ] ) . therefore one can easily test a ferrofluid whether it contains chains or not by choosing different combinations of @xmath176 and @xmath206 but the same value for @xmath182 . if the ferrofluid contains chains one get different thresholds whereas the surface of a chain - free ferrofluid is destabilized at a unique value of @xmath124 .    a ferrofluid with chains whose orientation is out of equilibrium compared with other model ferrofluids ( figs.[field ] , [ coupling ] ) has the lowest threshold of all .",
    "this is caused by a decrease of the real part of the effective viscosity [ fig .",
    "[ ef_visc](a ) ] which corresponds to a weaker dissipation of energy and thus to a lower value of @xmath124 . the nonzero imaginary part of the effective viscosity [ fig .",
