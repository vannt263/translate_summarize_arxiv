    "quantum entanglement is one of the pillars of quantum information processing .",
    "distribution of entanglement among two or more spatially separated parties is a necessary ingredient for many tasks in quantum information theory , including distributed quantum computing  @xcite , blind quantum computing  @xcite , teleportation  @xcite , telecloning  @xcite , secret sharing  @xcite and quantum cryptography schemes  @xcite .",
    "multipartite entanglement enables a violation of bell inequalities that grows exponentially with the number of parties  @xcite .",
    "however , the controlled distribution of entanglement , in particular of multipartite entanglement , over long distances is a major challenge , due to unavoidable imperfections such as particle losses and decoherence .",
    "the seminal idea of quantum repeaters @xcite is based on the distribution of short - range entanglement between intermediate repeater stations ( thus avoiding losses that grow typically exponentially with the distance ) and subsequent entanglement swapping , which connects the short links along a line to long - range bipartite entanglement .",
    "several theoretical variations have been proposed : some of them are based on entanglement distillation  @xcite and others are based on forward error correction  @xcite .",
    "much experimental progress towards the realisation of a quantum repeater has been made @xcite .",
    "`` partially quantum '' networks are considered in the so - called trusted node scenario  @xcite , while fully quantum networks have been investigated in the context of network routing  @xcite and coding  @xcite strategies and heterogeneous network technologies  @xcite .",
    "here we propose a general multipartite quantum network architecture , where the long - distance links are bridged by quantum repeater stations .",
    "this idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] for the long - term vision of a `` world - wide quantum web '' .",
    "this network contains nodes ( labelled by letters ) , which receive , measure and send particles .",
    "they could be located at , e.g. , key institutions .",
    "network nodes are connected by long - distance transmission channels , which are subdivided into shorter channels by an appropriate number of quantum repeater stations - an example is also shown in fig .  [ fig : weltkarte ] .",
    "any network such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] forms a mathematical graph by identifying the network nodes with vertices and the quantum channels with edges . to any graph",
    "a corresponding graph state can be associated  @xcite .",
    "these states are highly entangled and constitute a valuable resource , e.g. for one - way quantum computation  @xcite . in our proposal",
    "the goal is to establish a multipartite entangled graph state between the network nodes .",
    "this goal is reached in two steps .",
    "step 1 : a graph state is produced , where _ both _ the network nodes and the repeater stations constitute vertices .",
    "step 2 : the vertices corresponding to the repeater stations are `` removed '' by appropriate measurements .",
    "it is important to note that no memories are needed at the repeater stations , as the measurements can be performed immediately , as will be explained in more detail below .    in order to deal with unavoidable errors , for example photon losses in fibres or in the atmosphere",
    ", quantum error correction will be used , i.e. the nodes and repeater stations will process higher - dimensional encodings of physical qubits ; we will use stabiliser codes throughout this paper .    as the same language of stabilisers",
    "is used for both the encoding and the target states , our scheme of a global quantum repeater network is concise and general .",
    "a mathematical graph @xmath0 consists of a set @xmath1 of @xmath2 vertices and a set e of edges , each of which connects two vertices , i.e. @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] , the network nodes as well as the repeater stations are vertices , and all transmission channels between them are edges of a graph . to each mathematical graph",
    "g corresponds a graph state @xmath4 , which can be defined in two equivalent ways .",
    "first , a graph state can be physically produced by switching on a specific entangling gate for each edge of the graph .",
    "concretely , @xmath4 is the state that is created from the state @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , by applying a controlled - phase gate @xmath7 to each pair @xmath8 of vertices in @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 where in the computational basis @xmath11 the entangling gate reads @xmath12 .",
    "second , a graph state is the unique state which is eigenstate of a set of so - called stabiliser operators , with eigenvalues + 1 .",
    "each vertex @xmath13 of the graph has an associated stabiliser operator @xmath14 which is a product of the pauli-@xmath15 operator for vertex @xmath13 and the pauli-@xmath16 operator for all its neighbours , i.e. @xmath14 reads @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is a short - hand notation for the pauli operator @xmath15 acting on vertex @xmath13 and the identity @xmath19 at all other vertices .",
    "the graph state @xmath4 is defined via the eigenequations @xmath20 , for all @xmath21 .",
    "note that a product of stabiliser operators is also a stabiliser . in order to present our main idea ,",
    "let us first describe the two mentioned steps . in step 1 , a graph state according to the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] is created : for the simple line graphs , which constitute the long - distance links , each repeater station receives one qubit from the previous station , produces one qubit in state @xmath22 , entangles it with the qubit from the previous station via a @xmath7 gate and then sends the second qubit through the channel to the next repeater station , which acts in the same way . thus , the edges between repeater stations are created .",
    "the network nodes act in a slightly different way : depending on their number of neighbours , they receive a certain number of inputs , create a certain number of qubits in state @xmath22 , perform entangling @xmath7 gates , and send on the appropriate number of qubits to the neighbouring repeater stations .",
    "some examples are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] .",
    "thus , the whole graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] will be produced .    in step 2 ,",
    "the vertices corresponding to all repeater stations are removed by a simple pauli @xmath15-measurement at each repeater station .",
    "the reasoning is as follows : remember that a product of stabilisers is also a stabiliser .",
    "consider the vertex s ( south africa ) in the quantum network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] and assume that the number of repeater stations is even on each edge ( odd numbers can be treated in an analogous way ) .",
    "take the product of the stabiliser generators starting from s and for every second repeater station , until reaching the neighbours t , m , p , i , and r. due to the definition of @xmath14 in equation  ( [ eq : gi ] ) and the fact that @xmath23 , this product of stabilisers contains only @xmath15-operators at s and the mentioned repeater stations , and @xmath16-operators on the neighbouring network nodes of s in the network ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we call this stabiliser operator the main stabiliser centred on s. measuring all repeater stations in the @xmath15-basis projects the state onto one stabilised by @xmath24 in the hilbert space of the network nodes only . here",
    "the sign of the stabilizer operator depends on the parity of the measurement outcomes of the repeater stations included in the main stabiliser centred on s. the minus sign can be removed by applying the so - called by - product operator @xmath25 in this case .",
    "this reasoning holds for all network nodes . by comparison of the obtained stabilisers with equation  ( [ eq : gi ] )",
    "it is clear that the graph state corresponding to the global network ( large vertices in fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] ) has been produced .    even though we have explained the procedure in two consecutive steps ,",
    "it is not necessary to store the full graph state : as the local measurements commute with the operations on other repeater stations , a qubit can be measured immediately after action of the @xmath7 gate , which is easier to realise experimentally .",
    "thus , the whole graph state between network nodes is gradually built up in a one - way fashion , as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : weltkarte ] , without need for memories in the repeater stations .    in an implementation of the above scheme",
    ", losses in the transmission channels , noise in the gates as well as errors in preparation and measurement will occur and would lead to a low - quality output state . as a solution to this problem , quantum error correction can be employed : the main idea is to encode the state of a so - called logical qubit redundantly into many physical qubits , such that a local error leads to a unique error syndrome and can be corrected by applying a suitable operation  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to previous ideas  @xcite where graph states were used as resource states for measurement - based implementations of quantum error correction .    in the present article",
    "we make use of so - called stabiliser codes  @xcite , which are defined via a set of stabiliser operators , the eigenstates of which ( with eigenvalue 1 ) are the codewords . in particular , we focus here on a subclass of stabiliser codes , the calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) codes  @xcite which have the useful property of `` transversal '' logical entangling gates ( see appendix  [ sec : errprop ] ) . thus the only change in our scheme is that instead of initial physical qubit states @xmath22 multi - qubit encoded logical states , denoted in the following as @xmath26 , need to be generated .",
    "the specific structure of @xmath26 depends on the chosen error correction code .",
    "low - error state preparation can be done more efficiently than general quantum operations on an unknown state , see e.g. @xcite for a preparation scheme for the quantum golay code  @xcite .",
    "the repeater operation in the encoded case and the short - hand notation @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the measurement on the encoded state is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : logicalrepeater ] .",
    "the unified description of the quantum network in terms of stabilisers for both the states and the encoding allows for a comprehensive analysis of errors and performance study .",
    "an error can be noticed , in the sense that it is known which qubit is affected ( e.g. a no - detection event ) , or unnoticed ( noise ) . for our performance study we will use the usual exponential loss model in optical fibres , i.e. the failure probability during transmission @xmath28",
    "is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a coupling failure probability , @xmath31 is the distance between repeater stations and @xmath32 is the attenuation length of the fibre , for which we will use the value @xmath33 .",
    "all qubit errors ( for sources , gates , channels , detectors ) will be modelled by the depolarizing channel , characterised as @xmath34",
    "i.e. with a failure probability @xmath35 the state of the qubit is proportional to the identity , and with probability @xmath36 it is unaffected .",
    "thus in case of failure the state is depolarized to the completely mixed state .",
    "the same effect is achieved by randomly applying bit - flips and phase - flips to the state .",
    "this mathematically equivalent viewpoint of a perfect operation followed by discrete @xmath15 and @xmath16 errors is very convenient  @xcite .",
    "when a physical @xmath15 or @xmath16 error has occurred , it propagates via the gates through the network , i.e. it may influence the consecutive qubits and measurement results .",
    "however , fortunately the spreading of errors along a repeater line is restricted to a finite length , concretely to up to two repeater stations .",
    "this is due to some simple rules for error propagation via a @xmath7 gate : a @xmath16 error that occurs on one of the two input qubits of a @xmath7 gate remains a @xmath16 error on the corresponding output qubit and does not affect the other output qubit .",
    "an @xmath15 error that occurs on one of the two input qubits remains an @xmath15 error on the corresponding output qubit , but also causes a @xmath16 error on the other output qubit .",
    "( if more than one error has occurred , the output qubits will suffer from corresponding products of errors . ) an @xmath15 or @xmath16 error may therefore be spread to the next repeater station , where the corresponding qubit will pass through the next @xmath7 gate and then will be measured . regarding the measurement , an @xmath15- ( @xmath16-)error before an @xmath15- ( @xmath16-)measurement does not affect the measurement outcome , while an @xmath15- ( @xmath16-)error before a @xmath16- ( @xmath15-)measurement flips the measurement outcome .",
    "the possible sources of errors are shown in fig  [ fig : circuit ] .",
    "it is important to note , due to the arguments given above , that repeater station number @xmath13 is only influenced by errors propagating from nearest and next - to - nearest neighbours , i.e. from stations @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    if an error is noticed , the corresponding measurement outcome is set to `` @xmath39 '' .",
    "the physical error rate depends on the failure probabilities for transmission , gates and measurements and is explicitly calculated in appendix  [ sec : errprop ] .",
    "are shown . here , ? denotes noticed errors and  denotes unnoticed errors .",
    "the measurement outcome at repeater station @xmath13 is marked as ? in case of a noticed error , and may be flipped in case of an unnoticed error . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] we focus on the physical error rates along a repeater line .",
    "the generalisation of our analysis to more gates and more qubits in the case of the network nodes is straightforward and can be described in terms of the vertex ( in- and out-)degree , see appendix  [ sec : generalization ] .",
    "note , however , that in a large - scale quantum network there are many more repeater stations than network nodes .",
    "thus the performance of the network mainly depends on the error rate at the repeater stations , which was described above .    up to now",
    "we have described the physical errors . for a given encoding the logical error rate ,",
    "i.e. the rate of uncorrectable errors , is a function of the physical error rate , see appendix  [ sec : fqbar ] .",
    "remember that the ( logical ) measurement outcomes at the repeater stations of the main stabiliser centred on a node @xmath40 determine whether the by - product operator @xmath41 needs to be applied .",
    "thus even numbers of logical errors on the corresponding repeater stations cancel each other .",
    "the local error rate @xmath42 at the vertex @xmath40 is an important indicator of the quality of the produced state .",
    "the formula to calculate @xmath42 follows the previous reasoning and is given in appendix  [ sec : logicalgraphstates ] .",
    "the error rates @xmath42 effectively combine all errors of the repeater stations and simplify the analysis considerably .",
    "the stabiliser error rates allow to bound the fidelity of the established state , see appendix  [ sec : logicalgraphstates ] .",
    "the performance of a quantum network may depend on the task it was built for : possible figures of merit are e.g. the rate for the production of a long - distance entangled state , the success probability for a task such as quantum teleportation , or the secret key rate in a cryptographic setting . in the following",
    "we will use as figure of merit the cost - performance ratio @xmath43 which compares the needed resources  @xcite : it is defined as the total number of needed qubits divided by the total distance @xmath44 and a specific quality factor @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of qubits per station ( neglecting preparation overhead ) and @xmath48 is the number of repeater stations .",
    "+   +   +    our description in the graph state language provides a tool to optimise the architecture of a quantum network : two graphs @xmath0 and @xmath49 with the same set of vertices @xmath1 but different sets of edges @xmath50 may correspond to local - unitary equivalent graph states  @xcite , i.e. states that are related by local basis changes .",
    "this fact leads to general optimisation arguments for quantum networks ; we now consider only network nodes as vertices and their connecting repeater lines as edges , which have a weight according to the number of repeater stations on this line .    1 .",
    "the graph @xmath49 can have fewer edges than @xmath0 .",
    "this corresponds to a reduced number of repeater lines in a network , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : ga ] .",
    "2 .   the graph @xmath49 can have less cycles than @xmath0 , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : ga ] and [ fig : gd ] .",
    "note that in general cycles increase the required coherence time of the used quantum memories at the network nodes , because the qubits need to be stored until all gates have been applied to them .",
    "the total length of the edges in @xmath9 and @xmath51 may differ , even if the number of edges of @xmath49 and @xmath0 are equal , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : gc ] .",
    "one can thus minimize the total number of repeater stations in the network .",
    "4 .   the maximal vertex degree of @xmath0 and @xmath49 may be different . given that the number of repeater stations is optimized w.r.t .",
    "@xmath43 for each individual edge , the rate of errors increases with the vertex degree ( see appendix  [ sec : logicalgraphstates ] ) .",
    "thus it can be advantageous to reduce the maximal vertex degree , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : gd ] .    in order to illustrate the general performance of a graph state quantum repeater and to compare different codes we consider in the following a bipartite setting , i.e. one repeater line .",
    "this is a typical quantum cryptographic scenario , and therefore we use as the quality factor @xmath45 in the cost - performance ratio @xmath43 the effective secret fraction @xmath52 , given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the probability for not aborting of the protocol ( one might choose to abort in case of a `` fatal '' pattern of noticed errors in order to increase the quality of the produced state ) , employing a given code .",
    "the factor @xmath55 is the secret fraction for the bb84 protocol , given by  @xcite @xmath56 here , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the error rates of the two end nodes , and the binary entropy is defined as @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath57 and @xmath58 depend on the logical error rate of the error correction code : a logical measurement error remains , if the outcomes are decoded to a codeword with wrong parity .",

    "note that the number of repeater stations in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcgraphen ] , i.e. the optimal weight of the long - distance edges , was also calculated using this bipartite figure of merit for each edge . for a comparison of various encoding schemes with the original repeater see figure  [ fig : costs ] . for distances larger than about 800 km",
