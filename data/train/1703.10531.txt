    "the understanding of irreversible phenomena is a long - standing problem in statistical mechanics",
    ". explanations of the fundamental laws of phenomenological nonequilibrium ( ne ) thermodynamics have been given and applied to quantum open systems for several decades @xcite .",
    "more recent discussions on the origin of thermodynamical laws at the nanoscale can be found in , for example , @xcite .",
    "originally the weak coupling limit of a finite - size central region interacting with thermal and/or particle baths was first considered @xcite .",
    "methods for dealing with the strong coupling limit have been recently developed  @xcite .",
    "one can study the ne thermodynamical properties and the entropy production in such systems when an external driving force is applied to the central region .",
    "the time dependence of the external force can be arbitrary or periodic @xcite .",
    "the long - time limit behaviour of the ne thermodynamics presents also very interesting properties @xcite .",
    "indeed , after some time much longer than some typical relaxation times of the finite system , a steady state can be obtained .",
    "such a state arises from the balance between irreversible processes ( fluxes of particle and/or energy ) and the driving forces induced by the reservoirs .",
    "the ne steady state presents some analogy to its equilibrium counterpart in the sense that an equilibrium state represents a stationary state of a closed system , while the ne steady state is the time - invariant state of an open system .",
    "the fact that the ne steady state can be seen as a pseudo - equilibrium state is central to the construction of the corresponding generalised gibbs ensembles @xcite and to the calculation of the entropy , heat or work production under ne conditions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we construct such a generalised gibbs expression for the ne density matrix and apply it to the calculation of the entropy production in the system under the presence of both a temperature difference and a chemical potential difference between the two reservoirs .",
    "our approach has no restriction for the nature of the coupling ( strong or weak ) to the reservoirs , nor for the presence ( or absence ) of interaction between particle in the central region .    in section [ sec : nedensmat ] , we provide different , but fully compatible , expressions for the ne density matrix and show that the new terms in the ne density matrix ( new in the sense that they do not appear in the equilibrium grand - canonical density matrix ) are associated with the entropy production under the ne conditions . the entropy production rate is shown to be related to the fluxes of particle and heat across the system ( section [ sec : entropy ] ) .",
    "we provide in section [ sec : example_deltas ] some numerical calculations of the entropy production rate for a model system of a single electron resonance coupled to two fermi reservoirs . a comparison to earlier results @xcite",

    "explicit derivations are provided in some limiting cases and it is shown that ne entropy is produced not only in the central region but also in the reservoirs .",
    "for the single resonance model , we also calculate the ne gibbs  -  von neumann entropy in the central region and present the corresponding results in section [ sec : example_sgibbs ] . our approach corroborate and extend earlier existing results .",

    "( [ eq : rho_ne_2 ] ) correspond to the most general expressions of the steady - state ne density matrix in the presence of both heat and charge currents ( for a two - reservoir device ) .",
    "we now use them to calculate the entropy production in the system under general ne conditions .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the different quantities @xmath117 or @xmath81 are related to the entropy production ( rate ) in the system .",
    "we can then define the ne entropy production @xmath118 in the steady state from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_ne_genhershfield ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_ne_2 ] ) in the following way : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the ne entropy production rate .",

    "a few remarks are now in order . at equilibrium when @xmath124 and @xmath125 , there are obviously no current flows and no extra entropy is produced ( apart from the equilibrium entropy arising from the thermal fluctuations in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 reservoirs ) . when @xmath124 , there is no energy flow and there is a charge current when @xmath61 . by convention , the ne averaged charge current @xmath121 is taken positive ( negative ) when flowing from @xmath126 to @xmath127 , i.e. when @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "hence the contribution @xmath130 to the entropy production is always positive .",

    "using the same model system , i.e. the non - interacting single level coupled to two reservoirs , we provide in the next section results for the entropy production rate for a wide range of parameters .      in the absence of interaction , the hamiltonian for the central region @xmath0",

    "the non - interacting reservoirs are also described by a quadratic hamiltonian @xmath14 with @xmath138 where @xmath139 is an appropriate composite index to label the free electrons on the site @xmath140 of the @xmath27 reservoirs .",

    "they are just two different ways of summing that series . for",
    "a non - interacting problem for which the series can be resumed exactly , the negf and the ne density matrix with the @xmath146 operators approach provide the same result @xcite . for an interacting system",
    ", one must resort to approximations to partially resum the series , and therefore the two approaches are similar only when the same approximations are used . for the purpose of the present section",
    ", we then use the negf approach as the calculations are more straight forward in the non - interacting case .",
    "we also note that the negf formalism permits us to include local interaction in the central region in a compact and self - consistent scheme , as we have done in @xcite .    for the non - interacting system ,",

    "hence the width of @xmath147 increases with the strength of the coupling to the reservoirs , and therefore the currents will always have a larger values when increasing the strength of this coupling .",
    "consequently , the entropy production rate @xmath120 defined by eq.([eq : nesentropy_rate ] ) is always larger for larger values of the coupling to the reservoirs .    in figure 2 , we show how the ne entropy production rate @xmath120 depends on the ne conditions , i.e. on the chemical potential difference @xmath178 ( see left panels ( a ) and ( c ) in fig.2 ) or on temperature differences @xmath179 between the reservoirs ( see right panels ( b ) and ( d ) in fig.2 ) .",
