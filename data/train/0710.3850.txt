    "acetylene constitutes a key ingredient in the production of large complex hydrocarbon molecules in the dense interstellar medium ( herbst 1995 ) .",
    "because acetylene has no permanent dipole moment , it lacks a rotational spectrum that could be observed at radio wavelengths ; observations of interstellar acetylene have therefore been limited to mid - infrared studies of rovibrational bands , carried out from ground-(e.g . , evans , lacy & carr 1991 ; carr et al . 1995 ) and space - based ( e.g. , lahuis & van dishoeck 2000 ; boonman et al .",
    "2003 ; lahuis et al .",
    "2007 ) observatories .",
    "acetylene has been detected in the gas - phase - either in absorption ( e.g. , carr et al .",
    "1995 ; lahuis & van dishoeck 2000 ) or in emission ( e.g. boonman et al .",
    "2003 , this paper ) - mostly toward young stellar objects .",
    "c@xmath0h@xmath0 can be used as a tracer of warm ( 100 k to 1000 k ) molecular gas along often complicated sightlines .",
    "c@xmath0h@xmath0 abundance estimates , which were sometimes a few orders of magnitude higher than the predictions of cold gas - phase steady - state chemical models , have led to a better understanding of the role that warm gas - phase chemistry ( e.g. , doty et al .",
    "2002 ; rodgers & charnley 2001 ) and/or grain mantle processing ( e.g. , ruffle & herbst 2000 ) can play in star - forming regions , both locally and in extra - galactic objects ( lahuis et al . 2007 ) .    in this letter , we present the first detection of the @xmath1 band of acetylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) at 13.7 @xmath2 m toward the star forming region cepheus a east using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) onboard the _ spitzer space telescope_. this is the first map of c@xmath0h@xmath0 obtained toward any interstellar gas cloud .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and data analysis .",
    "sections 3 and 4 compare the spatial distribution of c@xmath0h@xmath0 to those of gaseous co@xmath0 and h@xmath0 @xmath11(2 ) , and discuss the c@xmath0h@xmath0-emitting gas in the context of shock chemistry and local outflow activity .",
    "the presence of c@xmath0h@xmath0 on interstellar dust grains will also be discussed in the context of cometary ices composition .",
    "spectral maps were obtained with the irs instrument onboard _ spitzer _ as part of the guaranteed time observer program 113 .",
    "1@xmath12@xmath31@xmath12 square fields were observed with the short - low ( sl ) , short - high ( sh ) , and long - high ( lh ) modules , providing wavelength coverage from 5.2 to 25 @xmath2 m .",
    "we obtained continuous spatial sampling by stepping the slit perpendicular and parallel to its long axis in steps of one - half its width and 4/5 its length , respectively .",
    "the data were processed with version 12 of the pipeline .",
    "we used the spectroscopy modeling analysis and reduction tool ( smart , higdon et al .",
    "2004 ) , along with locally developed routines ( neufeld et al .",
    "2006 ) , to extract wavelength- and flux - calibrated spectra and to generate spectral line intensity maps .    to estimate the uncertainties in the c@xmath0h@xmath0 line intensities ( @xmath1 band at 13.7 @xmath2 m )",
    ", we first calculated the standard deviation ( @xmath13 ) around our best fit to the local continuum for each point in the map .",
    "we then shifted the best - fit continuum by @xmath141 @xmath13 and generated the corresponding new estimates of the line intensities .",
    "the difference between the best - fit line intensities and the intensities obtained by shifting the best - fit continuum model constitutes our @xmath141 @xmath13 errors .",
    "while extinction due to the long wavelength wing of the silicate feature ( 9.7 @xmath2 m ) certainly occurs , corrections to the c@xmath0h@xmath0 line intensities were not applied . as we will see below",
    ", c@xmath0h@xmath0 arises in a warm component located mostly in front of the cold quiescent gas traced by the silicates ( sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2007 , apj in press ) making a direct estimate of the fraction of dust located in this warm component nearly impossible . since our study also indicates that the silicates exhibit a homogeneous distribution over the spatial extent of the gaseous c@xmath0h@xmath0 emission , we are confident that the c@xmath0h@xmath0 intensity variations we see are not predominantly due to extinction effects .",
    "figure 1 ( _ upper _ ) shows a summed irs spectrum in the wavelength range containing acetylene at the spatial location corresponding to one peak in the c@xmath0h@xmath0 line emission intensity map ( hw5/6 in fig .  2 ) .",
    "note that frequent order mismatches around 14 @xmath2 m preclude any reliable detection of the hcn @xmath15 band at 14.05 @xmath2 m with our data .",
    "the striking similarities between the c@xmath0h@xmath0 maps presented here ( fig .  2 ) and the gaseous co@xmath0 maps we found previously ( sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2006 ) strongly suggest that c@xmath0h@xmath0 arises in the same warm postshock gas component exhibiting gaseous co@xmath0 . because the c@xmath0h@xmath0 emission lines are weaker by a factor @xmath510 than those of co@xmath0 , we first searched for the spatial positions where c@xmath0h@xmath0 was detected at a @xmath161.5 @xmath13 level .",
    "38 such individual spatial positions fulfilled this criterion over the mapped region shown in fig .  2 .",
    "these are the spectra that we will consider when comparing the c@xmath0h@xmath0 distribution with that of gas - phase co@xmath0 and h@xmath0 @xmath11(2 ) , a tracer of shock activity ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "we constrained the gas temperature in the selected c@xmath0h@xmath0-emitting region , by comparing synthetic profiles of the @xmath1 acetylene band for temperatures ranging from 50 to 900 k with the observed c@xmath0h@xmath0 @xmath17-branch ( 13.71 @xmath2 m ) profile .",
    "we find that temperatures between 50 and 200 k best fit the 38 selected c@xmath0h@xmath0 line profiles ( fig .  1 , _ lower",
    "note that significantly higher temperatures , such as those found by lahuis & van dishoeck ( 2000 ) toward other massive young stellar objects ( 300 - 1000 k ) , are ruled out in cepheus a east .",
    "most importantly , our moderate 50 - 200 k range coincides with the temperature range found for gaseous co@xmath0 in that same region ( sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2006 ) arguing in favor of a common spatial origin for the two species .    to estimate the column density associated with the c@xmath0h@xmath0 emission",
    ", the dominant excitation mechanism needs to be identified .",
    "accurate collisional rates for vibrational excitation of acetylene are not available to our knowledge . if the collisional rates for c@xmath0h@xmath0 vibrational excitation were similar to those of co@xmath0 ( boonman et al . 2003 ) , densities higher than @xmath18 @xmath19 would be required to account for the observed emission .",
    "such a high density would give rise to strong high - lying h@xmath0o rotational lines that are , however , not detected ( e.g. , van den ancker et al . 2000 ) .",
    "additionally , considering the low temperature in the c@xmath0h@xmath0-emitting gas component relative to the energy of the @xmath20 state ( @xmath21 k ) , as well as the rather low local hydrogen density inferred over this region ( @xmath22@xmath5 few @xmath3 10@xmath23 to a few @xmath3 10@xmath24 @xmath19 ; codella et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is quite unlikely that collisions are the dominant excitation mechanism .",
    "radiative pumping by 13.7 @xmath2 m continuum photons produced by warm dust local to c@xmath0h@xmath0 is also unlikely to produce the observed emission , since we previously determined that the radiation field in this region is dominated by dust close to the hw2 protostellar region ( sonnentrucker et al .",
    "therefore , we conclude that radiative pumping by 13.7 continuum photons emanating from the hw2 protostellar region seems the most likely excitation mechanism for the observed acetylene molecules , as we also found for co@xmath0 ( sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we computed the c@xmath0h@xmath0 column densities over the mapped region , following the prescription described in sonnentrucker et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . under these assumptions , the derived @xmath10(c@xmath0h@xmath0 )",
    "values are proportional to the acetylene intensities and to the square of the angular separation from the exciting source , hw2 ( e.g. , gonzlez - alfonso et al . 2002 ) .",
    "figure 2 displays the intensity map ( _ upper _ ) and the derived column density map ( _ lower _ ) for c@xmath0h@xmath0 toward cepheus a east . the gray contours show the distribution of nh@xmath25 ( 1,1 ) a tracer of cold quiescent molecular gas ( torrelles et al .",
    "1993 ) toward the region fully sampled by _",
    "spitzer_. like gas - phase co@xmath0 , the @xmath17-branch of gaseous c@xmath0h@xmath0 mainly traces the walls of the cavity carved by the _ northeast _ component of the outflow originating at hw2 ( e.g. , gmez et al . 1999 ) , an outflow that is apparently responsible for the disruption of the quiescent clouds as seen in the nh@xmath25 distribution ( e.g. , torrelles et al . 1993 ; goetz et al .",
    "1998 ; van den ancker 2000 ) .",
    "intensity maxima for c@xmath0h@xmath0 are detected close to the hw6 radio continuum source , at the ne bridge that joins the cep a-2 and cep a-3 cloud cores ( torrelles et al . 1993 ) , and along the western surface of the cep a-3 cloud .",
    "weaker emission is also found further from the ne bridge .",
    "the similarities in both the temperature and the spatial distribution of the c@xmath0h@xmath0 and co@xmath0 emitting gas add weight to the conjecture that both species arise from the same warm shocked component .",
    "we finally searched for correlations between the acetylene measurements and those obtained for gas - phase co@xmath0 and h@xmath0 @xmath11(2 ) , a tracer of shock activity , for those 38 positions where c@xmath0h@xmath0 was detected at a @xmath161.5@xmath13 level .",
    "figure 3 compares the c@xmath0h@xmath0 intensity with that of gaseous co@xmath0 ( _ upper _ ) , as well as the c@xmath0h@xmath0 column density with the co@xmath0 column density ( _ middle _ ) and the h@xmath0 @xmath11(2 ) intensity ( _ lower _ ) . in all cases",
    ", the good correlation found between acetylene , gaseous co@xmath0 and h@xmath0 @xmath11(2 ) indicates that c@xmath0h@xmath0 does indeed arise in the warm shocked component also containing gaseous co@xmath0 .",
    "acetylene was previously observed toward low - to - high mass star - forming regions either in absorption ( e.g. , lahuis & van dishoeck 2000 ) or in emission ( e.g. , boonman et al .",
    "2003 ) using the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) .",
    "excitation temperatures ranging from @xmath5 10 to 900 k and abundances with respect to h@xmath0 ranging from a few @xmath3 10@xmath9 to a few @xmath3 10@xmath26 were derived .",
    "steady - state models of gas - phase chemistry in cold ( 10 - 50k ) dense ( 10@xmath27 - 10@xmath28 @xmath19 ) molecular clouds predict abundances for acetylene between a few @xmath3 10@xmath29 and 1@xmath3 10@xmath9 with respect to h@xmath0 depending on the role that neutral - neutral destruction reactions may play ( bettens , lee & herbst 1995 ; lee et al .",
    "similar abundances are predicted by models of gas - grain chemistry in quiescent clouds with the highest values obtained only after 10@xmath30 years ( ruffle & herbst 2000 ) .",
    "while such models could account for the observed abundances in the cold gas , they were unable to reproduce the enhancements observed toward much warmer gas components in those objects .",
    "mechanisms such as c@xmath0h@xmath0 ice sublimation from grain mantles and/or c@xmath0h@xmath0 enhancements via warm gas - phase chemistry were then invoked ( e.g. , carr et al . 1995 ; doty et al .",
    "2002 ; boonman et al .",
    "2003 ) .    for the ne outflow region in cepheus a east",
    ", we derive c@xmath0h@xmath0/h@xmath0 abundance ratios in the range 1 @xmath3 10@xmath8 to 4 @xmath3 10@xmath9 , for an assumed h@xmath0 column density of 1.5 @xmath3 10@xmath31 @xmath19 ( gmez et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these values are averages along the observed sight - lines .",
    "the highest abundances are localized around and to the south of , the ne position as well as around the positions of the hw5/6 sources ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this is precisely where the interaction between the _ northeast _ outflow and the ambient molecular clouds occurs , and it is in these regions that we observe strong h@xmath0 @xmath11(2 ) emission , a tracer of warm shocked gas .",
    "thus the spatial variation of the c@xmath0h@xmath0 abundance again strongly suggests an association with shock activity , perhaps as a result of ( 1 ) production in the gas phase via high temperature reactions , or ( 2 ) grain mantle sputtering .    models for chemistry in hot cores ( rodgers & charnley 2001 ; doty et al . 2002 ) indicate that enhanced abundances of c@xmath0h@xmath0 ( @xmath5 few @xmath3 10@xmath9 ) are expected in warm regions with @xmath32 200 k. the good correlations between h@xmath0 @xmath11(2 ) , gaseous co@xmath0 and c@xmath0h@xmath0 indicate that such high temperatures were reached in the warm gas at the passage of the non - dissociative shock .",
    "the chemical pathways leading to the production of c@xmath0h@xmath0 are slow , and enhanced abundances only occur after @xmath5 10@xmath33 years , a time scale much greater than that expected for shock heating of the gas ( @xmath5 300 years ; e.g. kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) .",
    "hence , enhanced production of c@xmath0h@xmath0 by high temperature gas - phase chemistry is unlikely to be predominant in the observed region .",
    "thus the correlations shown in fig .  3 argue in favor of grain mantle sputtering over gas - phase production as the origin of the c@xmath0h@xmath0 in cepheus a east .",
    "this is the same production mechanism that we favored for gaseous co@xmath0 ( sonnentrucker et al .",
    "while models for the production of c@xmath0h@xmath0 in shocks are not available to our knowledge , our results further suggest that both c@xmath0h@xmath0 and co@xmath0 are released into the gas phase under very similar physical conditions .",
    "the gaseous @xmath34 ratio is roughly constant , with a mean value of 0.08 for all sight - lines where we detected acetylene at the 1.5 @xmath13 level . if this value reflects the composition of the grain mantle , and given a @xmath10(co@xmath0)@xmath35/@xmath10(h@xmath0o)@xmath35 ratio in this source of 0.22 ( sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2007 , apj in press ) , then the required @xmath10(c@xmath0h@xmath0)@xmath35/@xmath10(h@xmath0o)@xmath35 ratio is 0.02 .",
    "this value is at least a factor 4 larger than those derived toward other star - forming regions ( 0.1 - 0.5% , evans et al . 1991 ; lahuis & van dishoeck 2000 ) and those predicted by theoretical models ( 0.1 - 0.5% , hasegawa & herbst 1993 ; ruffle & herbst 2000 ) , and at least a factor 2 larger than the gaseous c@xmath0h@xmath0/h@xmath0o ratios obtained in observations of cometary comae ( 0.1 - 0.9% , brooke et al .",
    "1996 ; weaver et al .",
    "we speculate that these discrepancies might result from ( 1 ) the destruction of co@xmath0 by reaction with atomic hydrogen in shocks faster than @xmath5 30 km s@xmath36 ( predicted by charnley & kaufman , 2000 ) and/or ( 2 ) a greater efficiency for sputtering of c@xmath0h@xmath0 in slow shocks . would not necessarily require any fine tuning of the shock velocity .",
    "in reality , any sight - line typically samples an ensemble of shocks with a _ range _ of shock velocities , and the constancy of the @xmath34 would simply indicate that the admixture of shock velocities varies little from one sight - line to another ( e.g. neufeld et al .",
    "2006 ) . ] in either case , the gaseous c@xmath0h@xmath0/co@xmath0 ratios we observed may exceed the solid c@xmath0h@xmath0/co@xmath0 ratio , and the @xmath10(c@xmath0h@xmath0)@xmath35/@xmath10(h@xmath0o)@xmath35 ratio could be less than 0.02 . unfortunately , direct measurements of acetylene ice are not possible , the weak features expected from solid c@xmath0h@xmath0 being blended with much stronger features of co and h@xmath0o ( boudin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , further observations of gaseous c@xmath0h@xmath0 at a higher signal - to - noise ratio would be very valuable as a probe of any variations in the @xmath34 ratio which might provide important clues to the shock physics .",
