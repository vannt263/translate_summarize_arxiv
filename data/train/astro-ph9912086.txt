    "in the pn phase , stars more massive than 0.8  @xmath4  return to the ism material that has been processed in the stellar interior . this matter mixes with the surrounding medium and modifies the original abundances of elements .",
    "the contribution of pne to the galactic chemical evolution is particularly important for @xmath2he which , together with deuterium , plays a fundamental role in testing the standard big bang nucleosynthesis model . while the evolution of deuterium is well understood , that of @xmath2he still encounters serious problems which cast doubts on the usefulness of this isotope as a test of big bang nucleosynthesis models ( e.g. galli et al .",
    "1995 ; for a different opinion on deuterium see mullan & linsky  1999 ) .",
    "observations of @xmath2he toward pne and hii regions have resulted in abundances that differ by almost two orders of magnitude : @xmath2he / h  @xmath5 in pne ( rood et al .",
    "1992 , balser et al .  1997 ) , and @xmath2he / h  @xmath6 in hii regions ( balser et al .",
    "1994 , rood et al .",
    "the latter value is also representative of the @xmath2he abundance in the presolar material ( geiss  1993 ) and the local ism ( gloeckler & geiss  1996 ) .",
    "however , the abundance in pne agrees with the predictions of standard stellar evolution models for stars of mass 11.5  @xmath4(see the review by rood et al .",
    "the main question is then : if low - mass stars are net producers of @xmath2he and return it to the ism during the pn phase , why do nt we observe a much higher abundance in hii regions and in the solar system material , as all standard galactic evolutionary models predict ( see e.g. tosi  1996 ) ?",
    "an interesting solution to this problem involves the existence of a nonstandard mixing mechanism ( or cool bottom processing , hereafter cbp ) which operates during the red giant phase of stars with @xmath7  @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to decreasing the amount of @xmath2he in the stellar envelope , this process affects the abundances of other important elements , including carbon , as first suggested by hogan  ( 1995 ) , charbonnel  ( 1995 ) and wasserburg et al .",
    "in particular , the ratio of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  in the envelope is predicted to be much _ lower _ than in the standard case . for a 1  @xmath4  star ,",
    "the predicted ratio is about 5 against the standard value of 2530 in the red giant branch ( rgb ) and of 2040 in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "however , the discrepancy becomes larger for more massive stars where the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio can reach @xmath8100 in the agb phase ( charbonnel  1995 ; weiss et al .",
    "1996 ; forestini & charbonnel  1997 , hereafter fc ; van den hoek & groenewegen  1997 , herafter hg ; marigo  1998 ; boothroyd & sackmann  1999 , hereafter bs ) .    from an observational viewpoint ,",
    "it is important to obtain accurate measurements of the isotopic ratio in those pne where the @xmath2he abundance has been determined .",
    "should these objects show a high value of @xmath0c/@xmath1c , then no modifications to the standard stellar models would be required .",
    "otherwise , one has to invoke another selective process ( mixing , diffusion etc . ) that operates on some isotopes but not on @xmath2he .",
    "however , the number of pne with @xmath2he measurements is small ( e.g. balser et al . 1999 ) , whereas the suggested physical processes should be quite general and should affect the nucleosynthetic yields of all stars of mass less than @xmath9  @xmath4 .",
    "hence , it is critical to measure the carbon isotopic ratio in a sample of pne as large as possible",
    ".    the molecular envelopes of pne have been studied extensively at near infrared and millimeter wavelengths ( see e.g. kastner et al .  1996 , huggins et al .",
    "1996 , bachiller et al .",
    "these observations have shown that massive envelopes ( @xmath10  @xmath4 ) containing a rich variety of molecular species are commonly found around pne .",
    "co is the most widely observed species , and the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  isotopic ratio has been measured toward several pne ( bachiller et al .",
    "1989 , 1997 ; cox et al .",
    "these initial studies have shown that the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio is in the range 1020 .",
    "our project consists of two parts . in the first one , we have carried out high quality observations of @xmath0co and @xmath1co in six pne that have been searched for @xmath2he emission . in the second run",
    ", a larger sample of nebulae with strong @xmath0co line emission has been observed in the @xmath1co lines in order to determine the isotopic ratio in pne _ without _ @xmath2he measurements .",
    "galli et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter gstp ) have argued that extra - mixing processes must be at work in more than 70% of low - mass stars ( @xmath7  @xmath4 ) in order to reconcile the predictions of the galactic evolution of @xmath2he with the observational constraints .",
    "we set out this experiment to determine the isotopic ratio in a relatively large sample of pne .",
    "the observations were carried out with the iram 30-m telescope at pico veleta ( near granada , spain ) during two observing runs in november 1996 and may 1997 . in the first one we observed the six pne studied by balser et al .",
    "the observations were made simultaneously in the @xmath111 and 10 lines of @xmath0co .",
    "the strongest emitters were then observed in the @xmath1co lines . in the second run we searched for @xmath1co @xmath111 and 10 emission in 22 objects previously detected in @xmath0co by huggins et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . at the rest frequency of the @xmath111 and 10 @xmath0co lines ( near 115 and 230 ghz , respectively )",
    "the telescope beamsize and efficiency are 24@xmath12 and 0.6 ( 115 ghz ) and 12@xmath12 and 0.45 ( 230 ghz ) . the smaller beam size at 230 ghz , together with the small scale structure usually found in pne and with the high intrinsic co ( 21)/(10 ) line ratio , lead to observed 21/10 line ratios in the range 25 ( bachiller et al .",
    "1993 ) , meaning that the @xmath111 line is much more effective for co searches .",
    "the spectrometers used were two filter banks of 512 @xmath13 1 mhz channels , providing a spectral resolution of 1.3 km s@xmath14 in the @xmath0co 21 line , and 2.6 km s@xmath14 in the @xmath0co 10 line .",
    "typical system temperatures were around 600 k at 115 ghz and 8001000 k at 230 ghz .",
    "the spectra were calibrated with the standard chopper wheel method and are reported here in units of main - beam brightness temperature ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "molecular line observations at mm - wavelengths provide a powerful method to estimate the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio in pne . in particular , the @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratio should faithfully reflect the atomic @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio , since the mechanisms which could alter the @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratio are not expected to be at work in pne .",
    "in fact , the kinetic temperature in pn envelopes ( 2550 k ) is high enough that isotopic fractionation should not operate .",
    "also , selective photodissociation is expected to be compensated by the isotope exchange reaction @xmath0co+@xmath1c@xmath16co+c@xmath3 which is faster than the @xmath1co photodestruction in pn envelopes ( e.g. likkel et al .",
    "although the @xmath170 and @xmath111 lines of @xmath0co have been extensively observed in pne ( e.g. huggins et al .  1996 ) , very few observations of the @xmath1co lines are available and the value of the isotopic ratio is presently poorly known .    in order to estimate the @xmath0co/@xmath1co isotopic ratio , one needs to make a number of approximations .",
    "first , we assume that the emitting regions fill the antenna beams in the lines of both molecules , or that the filling factor is the same ( in the case of an extended clumpy medium ) .",
    "second , we assume that the rotational levels are thermalized at a representative uniform temperature of 25 k ( see e.g. bachiller et al .",
    "thermalization is indeed a reasonable assumption for @xmath0co and @xmath1co , since the dipole moment is quite small ( about 0.1 debye ) .",
    "third , if we assume that the emission is optically thin for both the @xmath0co and @xmath1co lines , then the @xmath0co/@xmath1co column density ratio is given by the ratio of the integrated intensities .",
    "we will discuss below the uncertainties introduced by this approach in the derived isotopic ratios .",
    "the results of the observations are given in table  1 where we list the pn name , the intensities @xmath18 of the @xmath0co and @xmath1co @xmath191 lines and the derived isotopic ratio .",
    "the sample of the six pne studied in @xmath2he shows little emission in co : with the exception of ngc  6720 , the values of i@xmath20 represent upper limits to the intensity and have been estimated from the line widths deduced from the expansion velocities listed in the catalog of acker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "bachiller et al .  ( 1989 ) detected an extended molecular envelope in ngc  6720 , the ring nebula .",
    "the co emission reveals a clumpy ring , resembling to that of the ionized nebula .",
    "we observed the @xmath191 and @xmath210 lines of @xmath1co in three positions and detected emission in all cases .",
    "1 shows the spectra of the four co and @xmath1co lines observed toward the strongest peak in the molecular envelope ( offset [ 40 , 20 ] from the central position ) . the measured isotopic ratio toward this position , where the s / n is the highest , is @xmath0c/@xmath1c  @xmath22 .",
    "this value is in agreement with a previous estimate of bachiller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and with the values obtained toward the two positions with lower s / n spectra .",
    "thus , our data provide no evidence for variations of the isotopic ratio across the nebula .",
    "we have also detected a line around the @xmath0co @xmath170 frequency in the central position of ngc  6543 , but we failed to detect the @xmath231 line at relatively low levels .",
    "this indicates that the line near the @xmath240 frequency is probably not due to co. it is interesting to recall that the h38@xmath25 recombination line is only separated by 3 mhz ( 7.8 km  s@xmath14 ) from the @xmath0co @xmath170 line . as discussed in bachiller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , the h38@xmath25 line can dominate the emission around the @xmath0co @xmath170 frequency in some nebulae with little or no molecular gas .",
    "we believe that this is the case in the central position of ngc  6543 .",
    ".co results for pne observed in @xmath2he [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     @xmath26  no heii , no zanstra analysis possible    let us examine the uncertainty involved in the final mass calculations .",
    "estimates of the stellar temperature and luminosity given in table  3 are affected by errors in magnitudes , fluxes , diameters and extinctions .",
    "however , these quantities are usually determined with good accuracy ( @xmath27 ) , so that the uncertainty in the derived mass of the central stars does not exceed @xmath28% , or @xmath29",
    "the values given in the table do not include errors on the distances to the pn , which can be intrinsically high ( up to 50% ) but are difficult to estimate on an individual basis .    to infer the main sequence masses , we have used the initial mass  final mass relation given by hervig  ( 1996 ) .",
    "this relation differs from that of weidemann  ( 1987 ) adopted in gstp .",
    "we preferred hervig s prescription since it is based on reliable observations of cluster white dwarfs , although the formal errors on the final mass are still substantial , and can amount to about 0.1 @xmath4 .",
    "since we derive initial masses from final masses , the errors on the former quantity can be even larger .",
    "quantitatively , we assign a formal error to the main sequence mass of @xmath30  @xmath4for low values of the initial mass ( @xmath31  @xmath4 ) , and a smaller error ( @xmath32  @xmath4 ) for higher masses .",
    "this difference is due to the change of the slope of the initial mass - final mass relation at about 2 @xmath4 : smaller masses are more sensitive to the adopted relation , and the uncertainty is correspondingly larger .",
    "how do we interpret our results on the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratios in the framework of stellar nucleosynthesis ? to help answering this question , we combine the information provided by the observed @xmath0c/@xmath1c  isotopic ratios with the mass estimates of the progenitors of the pne , and with the predictions of some representative stellar nucleosynthesis models .",
    "since the formation of a pn takes place at the end of the agb phase , the significant comparison is between the observed abundances and those predicted for the stellar ejecta at the agb tip .",
    "unfortunately , no stellar nucleosynthesis models up to these late phases are available in the literature for stars experiencing deep - mixing .",
    "for example , the calculations of boothroyd & sackmann ( 1999 ) allow to derive the mass dependence of the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio on the stellar surface at the tip of the red giant branch both for the standard case and in the presence of extra - mixing .",
    "the standard models indicate that the isotopic ratio has approximately a constant value of 2023 between @xmath33 and 4  @xmath4 , and then increases steadily at lower masses up to about 2830 with a small dependence on the stellar metallicity . in the case of extra mixing , the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio displays a sharp drop below @xmath9  @xmath4 , reaching values of 510 at @xmath81 m@xmath34 .",
    "similar results have also been obtained by charbonnel ( 1994 ) and denissenkov & weiss ( 1996 ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the distribution of the measured @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratios in 11 pne , together with the theoretical values in the ejecta of stars at the tip of the agb phase .",
    "the different curves refer to the models computed in the standard case with no mixing and solar metallicity by fc , hg , and marigo ( 1998 ) .",
    "3 indicates that over the mass interval between 1.5 and 4 m@xmath34 the predictions of the hg and marigo models are in good agreement with each other and indicate a roughly constant value of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  @xmath8100 .",
    "the models of fc show significantly lower ratios at 3 and 4 @xmath4 , but have the same qualitative behavior .",
    "these results are well understood in terms of the nucleosynthesis occurring during the thermally pulsating agb phase .",
    "in fact , a major phase of @xmath0c enrichment of the convective envelope results from the penetration of the convective tongue during thermal pulses ( see the discussion in , e.g. , fc and hg ) . at the same time , @xmath1c is partially burnt through the @xmath1c(@xmath25,n ) reaction at the bottom of the inter - shell region during the inter - pulse phase , as first suggested by straniero et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . the combination of these two effects accounts for the high @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio in this mass range .",
    "on the other hand , more massive agb stars experience hot bottom burning that progressively leads the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio close to its equilibrium value ( @xmath84 - 5 ) .    despite the uncertainties in our measurements",
    ", it appears that the standard models produce @xmath0c/@xmath1c  in excess of the values observed in our objects .",
    "the only exception is for the two lowest mass stars ( 0.9 and 1.0 @xmath4 ) computed by hg which agree with the ratios measured in m1 - 17 and ngc  6781 .",
    "although fig . 3 indicates a marked discrepancy between observed and theoretical values , one should be aware of the sensitivity of the predicted yields on the model assumptions .",
    "in particular , the isotopic ratios ( not only @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ) depend rather strongly on the adopted mass loss rate during the agb phase , on the third dredge - up efficiency , and on stellar metallicity .",
    "their combined effects have been thoroughly discussed by fc and hg and need not to be repeated here . in general , a shorter phase of mass loss and/or lower mass loss rates tend to decrease the surface @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio . however , a more efficient convective penetration results in a higher pollution of the envelope from pulse to pulse and a higher @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio . finally , stars with initial metallicities lower than solar yield higher @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratios .    returning to fig .",
    "3 , we see that several pne lie in the region of the diagram with low @xmath0c/@xmath1c  and low mass . for these objects",
    "we should expect the standard models to become inaccurate insofar as they neglect the possible occurrence of mixing mechanisms of non - convective origin which can alter the composition of the stellar ejecta .",
    "low values of the carbon isotopic ratio have also been measured in field population ii stars and in globular cluster giant ( e.g. sneden et al .",
    "1986 ; gilroy & brown 1991 ; pilachowski et al . 1997 ) and have provided the motivation to introduce extra - mixing processes in the standard evolution ( e.g. charbonnel  1995 ) .",
    "recently , charbonnel & do nascimento  ( 1998 ) find that more than 90% of a sample of 191 field and cluster red giants presents carbon isotopic ratios inconsistent with those predicted by standard nucleosynthesis .",
    "the observational situation in agb stars is less clear , because of the extreme sensitivity of the determination of isotopic ratios on excitation temperatures and model atmospheres .",
    "for example , greaves & holland ( 1997 ) have measured a @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio varying between 12 and 36 in a sample of 9 carbon stars with high mass - loss rates ( @xmath6 m@xmath35  yr@xmath14 ) , in accordance with similar results previously obtained by wannier & sahai ( 1987 ) on seven other carbon stars . on the other hand ,",
    "lambert et al . ( 1986 ) measured the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio in 30 cool carbon stars and found values between 30 and 70 .",
    "more recently , ohnaka & tsuji ( 1996 ) report ratios between 20 and 30 for 24 n - type carbon stars in common with the sample of lambert et al .",
    "these values are about a factor of 2 smaller than those derived by lambert et al .",
    "( see however the discussion in de laverny & gustafsson 1998 and ohnaka & tsuji 1998 ) , but are consistent with those found for our pn sample .",
    "if these samples are representative of the population of both carbon stars and pne , the low @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratios provide strong indication that most stars should experience some extra - mixing and deplete @xmath0c with respect to @xmath1c . according to this conjecture",
    ", it appears that in order to match the observations , _ more realistic stellar models should include additional physical processes to avoid too large _",
    "@xmath0c/@xmath1c  _ ratios throughout the latest stages of stellar evolution_.      theoretical models predict that stars with low values of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  should also have low @xmath2he abundances . in gstp",
    ", we estimated that to obtain consistency between the observed @xmath2he abundances and chemical evolution models , the majority of the galactic pne ( @xmath3670% ) should have a @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio well below the standard value . in this section",
    "we test this suggestion using the constraint provided by the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  observations in pne .",
    "chemical evolution models offer the adequate tool to follow simultaneously the evolution of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  and @xmath2he over the galactic lifetime .    in figs . 4 and 5 we show the evolution of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  and @xmath2he as a function of time in the solar neighborhood ( galactocentric radius @xmath37  kpc ) , and as a function of @xmath38 at the present time ( @xmath39  gyr ) , as predicted by models described by dearborn et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and sandrelli et al .",
    "the two figures correspond to different assumptions on the fraction of low - mass stars experiencing deep mixing in the rgb phase . in both cases ,",
    "the galactic evolution of the various isotopes has been computed assuming metallicity - dependent yields . in the upper panels",
    ", the solid line corresponds to models adopting the @xmath0c and @xmath1c yields from bs for stars in the mass range 0.8  2.5 @xmath4 , from fc in the range 3  6 @xmath4 , and from woosley & weaver  ( 1995 ) for massive stars .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines display the results obtained using the same yields as before , except for stars in the mass range 36 @xmath4 , where the hg and bs yields , respectively , are adopted .",
    "the calculations by bs are the only ones that provide the @xmath0c and @xmath1c yields for both the standard and the cbp cases . for @xmath2he",
    ", the standard yields are taken from dearborn et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the cbp yields from bs .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath2he is typical of the elements produced mainly by low - mass , long - lived stars .",
    "@xmath0c is a primary element produced by stars of any mass and available for galactic enrichment already after the explosions of the first massive objects .",
    "@xmath1c is mostly secondary and its bulk abundance is due to intermediate - mass stars .",
    "therefore , the enrichment of this element in the ism occurs later than that of @xmath0c .",
    "this delay causes the decrease of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  visible in figs .",
    "the positive radial gradient of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  is also due to the different mass intervals of stars that are producers of the carbon isotopes , and to the higher star formation activity in the inner galactic regions , independent of the stellar initial mass function .",
    "all these effects combined make the relative proportion of @xmath1c over @xmath0c producers increasingly higher for decreasing galactocentric distances .",
    "4 shows the standard case with no deep mixing , whereas the results with cbp in 90% of stars randomly chosen in the mass range",
    "@xmath40  @xmath4  are displayed in fig .",
    "the hatched regions represent the range of abundances resulting from 50 different cases for the random sorting .",
    "as already discussed by gstp , the overall enrichment of @xmath2he is very sensitive to the assumptions on deep mixing . on the contrary ,",
    "the variation of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  is marginal , since most of @xmath0c and @xmath1c is produced by stars more massive than 2.5  @xmath4  which are not affected by deep mixing processes .",
    "thus , altering the amount of @xmath0c and @xmath1c released by low - mass stars leads to smaller variations in the resulting abundances .",
    "for these reasons , the galactic evolution of @xmath2he is an excellent indicator of the fraction of low - mass stars which should undergo cbp , but that of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  is not . from figs .  4 and 5",
    ", one can see that the fraction required to reproduce the observed pattern of @xmath2he abundances is up to 90% , in agreement with the finding of charbonnel & do nascimento  ( 1998 ) .    as for @xmath0c/@xmath1c ,",
    "the predicted abundance distributions with time and with galactocentric distance are roughly consistent with the data regardless of the occurence of extra - mixing . the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio in the sun can not be accurately reproduced , and the radial gradient is flatter than the observed one ( as deduced from measurements in molecular clouds ) , independently of the adopted percentage of stars undergoing cbp . using the yields of fc and bs",
    "leads to a better fit of the solar value and to the present distribution of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  in the inner galactic regions .",
    "on the other hand , the models of hg reproduce the local ism ratio . in all cases ,",
    "the fraction of low - mass stars experiencing deep mixing does not affect significantly the overall results of the chemical evolution models .",
    "of course , deep mixing alters the values @xmath0c/@xmath1c  in low - mass stars , but the galactic evolution of @xmath0c and @xmath1c is mainly governed by stars in which this process is not expected to take place .",
    "one of the main goals of our study was the determination of the isotopic ratio in ngc  3242 , the best object for testing the mixing hypothesis since the @xmath2he measurements are very reliable _ and _ the progenitor mass is in the range where extra mixing should occur ( see also the discussion in rood et al .",
    "however , the high sensitivity of our observations and the fact that we searched for co emission across the whole circumstellar shell imply that co is absent in the nebula .",
    "we therefore conclude that the isotopic ratio can not be determined in this important object by means of millimeter line observations .",
    "the lack of a molecular envelope around ngc  3242 can be a consequence of the low - mass of the progenitor .",
    "it is well known that the transition from the agb phase to the pn stage is slow for low - mass stars and therefore the gas remains exposed to ionizing and dissociating radiation for a longer time than in the case of more massive stars .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the fact that the most massive object of our sample , ngc  6720 , indeed has a rich molecular envelope .",
    "unfortunately , ngc  6720 has an estimated progenitor mass of @xmath41  @xmath4 , quite close to the limit where the nonstandard mixing mechanism is expected to significantly affect the isotopic ratio .",
    "thus , the derived ratio is consistent with both standard and nonstandard evolutionary models .",
    "the lesson is clear : there is a trade - off between the need to select low - mass pne in order to discriminate between theoretical models and the higher detection rate of molecular envelopes around more massive objects .",
    "the determination of isotopic ratios may be a tricky business , but future observations should take up such a challenge .",
    "the method of using mm - wave transitions is not the only one adequate for measuring the isotopic abundance in pne .",
    "clegg  ( 1985 ) first pointed out the possibility of using the ciii ] multiplet near 1908     to obtain a direct estimate of the isotopic ratio in the _ ionized _ gas of pne .",
    "recently , clegg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have successfully detected the extremely weak isotopic line @xmath1c @xmath42p@xmath43@xmath44s@xmath45 in two pne ( plus a tentative detection in a third one ) , using the hst goddard high resolution spectrograph .",
    "the derived @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratios are 15@xmath463 in ngc  3918 and 21@xmath4611 in smc  n2 . in either case",
    ", no measurement at mm - wavelengths has been made to independently check the derived values . however , as clegg et al .",
    "point out , the two types of measurements are complementary since they can not be performed on the same objects : the uv transitions require high excitation conditions , while the opposite is true for the mm - wave lines studied by us . considering the negative results of the co search",
    ", it would be extremely important to perform the hst observations towards ngc  3242 .",
    "we have observed a sample of 28 pne in @xmath0co and @xmath1co . we have determined the isotopic ratio in 14 objects , 9 of which are new detections , and obtained robust upper limits in 4 other pne .",
    "the observations reported in this paper improve the available data on the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio in pne .",
    "the results confirm and extend earlier measurements which indicate values between 5 and 30 , below those predicted by current agb models . according to these calculations ,",
    "the value of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  in the ejecta of stars in the mass range between @xmath47 and @xmath48  @xmath4  is of the order of 100 . in order to agree with the observations , we suggest that stellar nucleosynthesis models should include the effects of extra - mixing to avoid the overproduction of @xmath0c with respect to @xmath1c not only during the rgb phase , but also in the latest phases of evolution .",
    "our estimates of the mass of the progenitor stars support this conclusion , since all pne considered here originated from stars with mass less than @xmath49  @xmath4 .",
    "the proposed extra - mixing mechanism is expected to be at work in this mass range ( hogan  1995 , charbonnel  1995 ) and represents at present the most likely solution to the so - called `` @xmath2he problem '' .    out of the six pne with measured @xmath2he abundances , only for one ( ngc  6720 ) it was possible to estimate the @xmath0c/@xmath1c  ratio .",
