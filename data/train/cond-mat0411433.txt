    "+ from a physical point of view the interesting feature of random k - sat problems is the presence of phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath5 and @xmath6 approach infinity and @xmath8 remains finite @xcite . here",
    "the transition is between sat and unsat phases where a typical instance of the formula is satisfied or unsatisfied respectively with probability @xmath9 .",
    "it is around the phase transition that the time needed to find the solution of a typical instance grows exponentially with the size of the problem @xmath5 .",
    "+ in this paper we study a generalized version of the random k - sat problems where each logical variable is negated with probability @xmath0 rather than @xmath10 as in the original random k - sat . the aim of this generalization is to go continuously from easy instances of the problem to hard ones .",
    "clearly for @xmath11 we have an easy random k - sat for all values of @xmath12 . on the other hand as the studies indicate , the problem is hard for @xmath13 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus one expects a crossover from easy to hard region by increasing @xmath0 from zero .",
    "is it possible to define a point beyond which one can say that the problem becomes hard ?",
    "how the problem approaches the hard regime ?",
    "what are the universal features of this crossover ?",
    "these are some questions which can provide us a deeper understanding of the typical complexity of random k - sat problems . + a similar problem to one that we are going to study is the horn - sat problem @xcite where all the clauses have at least one negated variable .",
    "it is an easy problem and solved in a polynomial time .",
    "however , notice that as long as @xmath12 is small fluctuations paly an important role in our problem and this could give rise to significantly different behaviors for the problem .",
    "there is also another problem called @xmath14 @xcite which by tuning @xmath0 goes from a @xmath15 to a @xmath16 problem .",
    "it is close to what we like to do in this paper but here we are able to study the easy - hard crossover for general @xmath12 and it is a more general problem to this end .",
    "+ in the following we first give the exact solution of 1-sat problem by a statistical mechanics approach .",
    "we find the average number of unsatisfied clauses and the average number of solutions in the ground state of the system and explain the origin of their behaviors .",
    "utilizing the cavity method and assuming the replica symmetry , we derive a relation for the critical point of k - sat problems .",

    "next we obtain the free energy and the distribution of effective fields with the aid of replica method and in the replica symmetry approximation .",

    "we take @xmath5 logical variables @xmath23 where @xmath24 if the corresponding variable is true and otherwise @xmath25 .",
    "alternatively we can speak of @xmath5 ising variables @xmath26 . on the other side",
    "we have a formula which consist of @xmath6 clauses which have been joined to each other by logical and .",

    "these variables , which join to each other by logical or , are negated with probability @xmath0 .",
    "one obtains the original random k - sat problem by choosing @xmath13 .",
    "here there is an example of a 2-sat formula with @xmath27 clauses and @xmath28 logical variables @xmath29 a very useful concept in these problems is the factor graph , a bipartite graph of variable nodes and function nodes . in fig.[f1 ] we have shown the factor graph of formula given above . in this figure the logical variables and the clauses have been represented by the circles ( variable nodes ) and the squares ( function nodes ) respectively .",
