    "<S> the two - dimensional quantum kagome antiferromagnet ( qka ) , a paradigm of correlated disordered spin states , seems to be resistant against valence - bond ordering , as a spin - liquid ( sl ) ground state preserving the lattice symmetry is predicted @xcite . however , this state is only slightly energetically favorable as compared to a valence - bond crystal ( vbc ) @xcite , which breaks the translational symmetry and could lead to a lattice distortion if assisted by the magnetoelastic coupling . since defects , inherently present in kagome materials , may be able to pin a vbc @xcite , it is interesting to pose the question of how much such perturbations to the qka can modify its ground state .    from early investigations </S>",

    "<S> this , together with the much smaller linewidth of the @xmath53 components @xcite and the fact that they are not exchange narrowed for * h*@xmath40*c * , reveals that the exchange coupling @xmath67 associated with the @xmath55 defects is small , i.e. , @xmath68 .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](c ) ] , implying a different local environment . </S>",
    "<S> the zn@xmath3 vacancies at the kagome sites , if present , could potentially be responsible for such defects by inducing local magnetization patterns in the surrounding spin liquid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if such vacancies are absent @xcite one could reconcile the existence of the @xmath69 defects by a local effect the interplane cu@xmath3 spins might have on the kagome planes by perturbing the intrinsic spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> such a local perturbation can pin a spinon kagome - lattice excitation @xcite , as recently found in the related kagome compound zn - brochantite @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> trivially , cu@xmath3 at the zn intersites could profoundly affect the intrinsic kagome physics by inducing random bonds on the kagome lattice @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , the required amount of disorder is unlikely realized in herbertsmithite and there is no apparent reason why the _ global _ threefold crystal symmetry should be broken . </S>",
    "<S> the same should apply to _ local _ jahn - teller distortions of the perfect octahedral environment at the zn intersites induced by the cu@xmath3 spins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the important question arises of whether the observed global symmetry reduction is in any way related to the establishment of the sl ground state , which could provide a global driving force . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the symmetry reduction in herbertsmithite may arise from local distortions if these are effectively coupled through the correlated electronic state of the system . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the lattice distortion should appear around the temperature where strong spin correlations pertinent to the sl state develop , i.e. around 50  k , where the kagome susceptibility exhibits its maximal value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though our investigation could not directly determine the possible onset temperature of this distortion  this would require unfeasible magnetic - torque measurement within the kagome plane @xcite  further arguments that favor this scenario can be found in the enhanced @xmath85cl nmr relaxation rate at 50  k @xcite and in a pronounced change of the quadrupolar frequency between 50 and 100  k at the @xmath4o site next to defects @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of the symmetry reduction in herbertsmithite is interesting in the context of a striped spin - liquid - crystal state , which was recently proposed as an instability of the dirac sl on the kagome lattice that breaks the uniaxial lattice symmetry , and also reduces the gauge symmetry from @xmath86 to @xmath87 @xcite . the only synchrotron xrd report at low @xmath5 s published to date failed to detect any obvious structural phase transition in herbertsmithite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rather small values of @xmath88 suggest that deformation of the hexagonal structure may be very small . on the other hand , a recent infrared reflectivity investigation reported an anomalous low-@xmath5 broadening of a low - frequency phonon mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this was interpreted as possibly signaling @xmath89 chirality symmetry breaking @xcite in the sl ground state , it could also be related to a structural deformation .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , our study has revealed that two types of intrinsic magnetic defects exist in herbertsmithite at low @xmath5 s , which differ significantly in their interactions with the surrounding kagome spins . </S>",
    "<S> the strongly exchange - coupled defects are identified by the broad esr component with a curie - weiss @xmath5 dependence of the susceptibility , while the second defect type , corresponding to the narrow esr components , is characterized by much weaker coupling and a steeper increase of their susceptibility on decreasing @xmath5 , possibly beyond the curie model . explaining the nature of the unexpectedly narrow esr response of the latter defects and their apparent isolation from the kagome spins should be a key avenue in future studies of the interplay between the defect and the intrinsic kagome physics in herbertsmithite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , both types of defects have provided evidence of a global symmetry reduction of the kagome lattice in herbertsmithite at low @xmath5 s . </S>",
    "<S> this changes the perspective on herbertsmithite and may have implications for the selection of its ground state . in order to better understand this intriguing discovery , refined _ ab initio _ calculations of relaxed structures in the presence and absence of the intersite disorder could potentially be highly informative , since the energy difference between perfect and defect structures is minimal @xcite .    </S>",
