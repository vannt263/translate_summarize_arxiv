    "the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems turns out to be very different from that of other , more familiar , many - body systems like neutral gases and plasmas due to the unshielded , long - range nature of the gravitational force @xcite .",
    "because of this fundamental difference , the notion of equilibrium is not always well - defined and these systems exhibit a non trivial behavior with the occurence of phase transitions associated with gravitational collapse . if the particles are treated as classical point - masses , it can be shown that no global entropy maximum exists , even if the system is restricted within a box so as to prevent evaporation @xcite .",
    "a self - gravitating system can increase entropy without bound by developing a dense and hot `` core '' surrounded by a dilute `` halo '' .",
    "there exists , however , local entropy maxima ( metastable equilibrium states ) if the condition @xmath0 is satisfied , i.e. if the energy @xmath1 is sufficiently large ( for a given box radius @xmath2 ) or if the radius is sufficiently small ( for a given energy @xmath1 ) .",
    "since these equilibrium states are only _ local _ entropy maxima , the question naturally emerges whether they are long - lived or if they will collapse to a configuration with higher entropy . in any case",
    ", a phase transition _ must _ occur for @xmath3 since the entropy has no extremum at all above this threshold @xcite . in that case",
    ", the system is expected to collapse indefinitly towards a state of higher and higher central concentration and temperature .",
    "this is the celebrated `` gravothermal catastrophe '' @xcite .",
    "however , if we introduce a repulsive potential at short distances , complete core collapse is prevented and it can be proved that a global entropy maximum now exists for all accessible values of energy .",
    "this effective repulsion can be introduced in many different ways but the physical results are rather insensitive to the precise form of the regularization .",
    "for example , we can study the case of self - gravitating fermions for which an exclusion principle imposes an upper bound on the distribution function @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can consider a classical hard spheres gas by introducing an `` excluded volume '' around each particle @xcite .",
    "other forms of regularization are possible @xcite .",
    "when such regularizations are introduced , it is possible to evidence properly three kinds of phase transitions of zeroth , first and second order .",
    "they separate a `` gaseous '' phase , which is independant on the small scale cut - off , from a `` condensed '' phase in which the particles are tightly bound .",
    "this is similar to the liquid / gas transition in an ordinary fluid .",
    "however , for long - range systems such as self - gravitating systems , the statistical ensembles are not interchangeable and phase transitions can occur both in the canonical and in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this results in the existence of _ two _ tricritical points , one in each ensemble . in that respect the self - gravitating fermi gas shares some analogies with the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model with infinite range interactions @xcite .",
    "the object of this paper is to provide a detailed description of phase transitions in self - gravitating systems . in the first part of the paper , we consider the case of self - gravitating fermions .",
    "the equilibrium phase diagram was calculated in an earlier paper @xcite and we complete this study by determining explicitly the values of energy ( in the microcanonical ensemble ) and temperature ( in the canonical ensemble ) at which the phase transitions occur . we also propose a simple analytical model to describe these phase transitions .",
    "the `` gaseous '' phase is modeled by a classical homogeneous sphere while the `` condensed '' phase is made of a completely degenerate nucleus surrounded by a hot atmosphere with uniform density ( restrained by the box ) .",
    "the mass @xmath4 of the nucleus is determined by maximizing the entropy ( resp .",
    "free energy ) versus @xmath4 for a given total mass and energy ( resp .",
    "temperature ) of the configuration .",
    "quite remarkably , this simple model can reproduce the main features of the numerical study .",
    "it also allows us to determine analytically how the energy or the temperature at the transition points depend on the degeneracy parameter .",
    "in the second part of the paper , we extend our analytical model to the case of a classical gas with a short distance cut - off .",
    "this model has been studied numerically by aronson & hansen @xcite and stahl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and our analytical model gives a good agreement with their numerical results .",
    "it is also consistent with the toy models of lynden - bell & lynden - bell @xcite and padmanabhan @xcite .",
    "the possible astrophysical applications of our study are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_astro ] .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath5 fermions interacting via newtonian gravity .",
    "these particles can be electrons in white dwarf stars @xcite , neutrons in neutron stars @xcite , massive neutrinos in dark matter models @xcite etc ... we assume that the mass of the configuration is sufficiently small so as to ignore relativistic effects .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the distribution function of the system , i.e. @xmath7 gives the mass of particles whose position and velocity are in the cell @xmath8 at time @xmath9 .",
    "the integral of @xmath10 over the velocity determines the spatial density @xmath11 and the total mass of the configuration is given by @xmath12 where the integral extends over the entire domain .",
    "on the other hand , in the meanfield approximation , the total energy of the system can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the kinetic energy and @xmath15 the potential energy .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath16 is related to the star density by the newton - poisson equation @xmath17 finally , the fermi - dirac entropy is given by the formula @xmath18 which can be obtained by a standard combinatorial analysis . in this expression , @xmath19 is the maximum value accessible to the distribution function .",
    "if @xmath20 denotes the spin multiplicity of the quantum states , @xmath21 the mass of the particles and @xmath22 the planck constant , one has by virtue of the pauli exclusion principle @xmath23 .",
    "an entropy of the form ( [ fd5 ] ) was also introduced by lynden - bell @xcite in the context of collisionless self - gravitating systems ( e.g. , elliptical galaxies , dark matter ) undergoing a `` violent relaxation '' by phase mixing @xcite . in that context",
    ", @xmath19 represents the maximum value of the initial distribution function and the actual distribution function ( coarse - grained ) must always satisfy @xmath24 by virtue of the liouville theorem .",
    "this is the origin of the `` effective '' exclusion principle in lynden - bell s theory which has obviously nothing to do with quantum mechanics . in reality",
    ", the mixing entropy introduced by lynden - bell is a complicated sum of fermi - dirac entropies for each phase level constituting the initial condition . for simplicity",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the single level approximation for which the mixing entropy coincides with expression ( [ fd5 ] ) .    at statistical equilibrium ,",
    "the system is expected to maximize the fermi - dirac entropy at fixed mass and energy .",
    "introducing lagrange multipliers to satisfy these constraints , we find that the _ critical points _ of entropy correspond to the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a strictly positive constant insuring that @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the inverse temperature . in the fully degenerate limit @xmath29 , this distribution function has been extensively studied in the context of white dwarf stars in which gravity is balanced by the pressure of a degenerate electron gas @xcite . in the non degenerate limit @xmath30 , the fermi - dirac distribution reduces to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath31 so that we expect to recover the properties of classical isothermal spheres at low densities @xcite . in particular , the fermi - dirac spheres , like the isothermal spheres , have an infinite mass and one is forced to confine the system within a box of radius @xmath2 .",
    "physically , this confinement is justified by the realization that the relaxation is _ incomplete _ so that the conditions of applicability of statistical mechanics , regarding for example the ergodic hypothesis , can be fulfilled only in a limited region of space .",
    "in addition , an astrophysical system is never completely isolated and @xmath2 could represent the typical radius at which the system interacts with its neighbors .",
    "kinetic equations have been proposed to describe the relaxation of self - gravitating systems towards the fermi - dirac distribution @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the system is subject to tidal forces and if we allow high energy particles to escape the system when they reach an energy @xmath32 , an extension of the michie - king model taking into account the degeneracy can be deduced from these equations @xcite . for @xmath33 , one has @xmath34 while @xmath35 for @xmath36 since the stars have been removed by the tidal field .",
    "when @xmath37 , we recover the michie - king model @xcite and when @xmath38 , we recover the fermi - dirac distribution ( [ fd6 ] ) .",
    "the density associated with this distribution function goes to zero at a finite radius , identified as the tidal radius .",
    "therefore , the configuration has a finite mass .",
    "this distribution function could describe elliptical galaxies and galactic halos limited in extension as a consequence of tidal interactions with other systems @xcite .",
    "this model is of course more realistic than the box model .",
    "however , in order to exhibit phase transitions in self - gravitating systems , the box model provides a more convenient theoretical framework and we shall use it in the sequel .",
    "the thermodynamical parameters for fermi - dirac spheres in the meanfield approximation have been calculated by chavanis & sommeria @xcite and we shall directly use their results .",
    "the equation determining the gravitational potential at equilibrium is obtained by substituting the fermi - dirac distribution ( [ fd6 ] ) in the poisson equation ( [ fd4 ] ) , using eq .",
    "( [ fd1 ] ) . introducing the variables @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the central potential , @xmath41 and @xmath42",

    "these stability results can be deduced from the turning point analysis of katz @xcite or by solving the eigenvalue equations associated with the second order variations of entropy or free energy @xcite . for @xmath84 and @xmath85 ,",
    "the stable solutions are only _ metastable_. there are no global maxima of entropy or free energy for classical point masses in gravitational interaction @xcite .",
    "we also note that the region of negative specific heats ( between points ce and mce ) is stable in the microcanonical ensemble and unstable in the canonical ensemble , where it is replaced by a phase transition ( an `` isothermal collapse '' ) .",
    "this is expected on physical grounds since it can be shown quite generally that the specific heat _ must _ be positive in the canonical ensemble @xcite . these results clearly indicate that the statistical ensembles are not interchangeable in the case of self - gravitating systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "[ etalambda ] is reported in fig .",

    "@xcite for self - gravitating fermions , these solutions are both entropy maxima ( em ) while the intermediate solutions ( points b ) are unstable saddle points ( sp ) .",
    "these points are similar to points a , except that they contain a small embryonic nucleus ( with small mass and energy ) which plays the role of a `` germ '' in the langage of phase transition .",
    "the density profiles of these solutions are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to be more precise , we have ploted the entropy of these solutions as a function of energy in fig .",
    "the entropy of the unstable phase ( points b ) is always smaller than the entropy of the stable phases , as it should .",
    "there is now a crossing point in the diagram , at @xmath91 , which marks the onset of a phase transition . at that point ,",
    "the `` gaseous '' phase and the `` condensed '' phase have the same entropy .",
    "as @xmath64 is increased across the transition point , the non degenerate solutions ( points a ) pass from global to local entropy maxima .",
    "inversely , the degenerate solutions ( points c ) pass from local to global entropy maxima .",
    "we expect therefore a phase transition to occur from the `` gaseous '' phase to the `` condensed '' phase when @xmath92 .",
    "the `` kink '' in the curve @xmath93 at the transition point where the two branches intersect corresponds to a discontinuity of temperature in the equilibrium phase diagram ( see the vertical plateau in fig . [ le5 ] ) .",
    "the specific heat is also discontinuous at that point and turns from positive to negative . according to stahl _",
    "@xcite , this phase transition could be called a `` gravitational first order phase transition '' .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that contrary to the liquid / vapor transition , the two phases can not coexist in the present situation .    for @xmath94 ,",
    "the non degenerate solutions are metastable but we may suspect @xcite that they are long - lived so that they _ are _ physical .",
    "these solutions are insensitive to the small - scale regularization and depend only on the long - range gravitational interaction . in the limit @xmath95",
    ", the transition energy @xmath96 goes to @xmath97 and we recover the classical spiral of fig .",
    "[ etalambda ] .",
    "this spiral is formed by the metastable states of the `` gaseous '' phase ( points a ) .",
    "the `` condensed '' phase ( points c ) is superposed to the @xmath64-axis .",
    "these states have an infinite central density and an infinite temperature . the unstable branch ( points b ) coincides with the spiral but these states physically differ from the `` gaseous '' states ( points a ) by the presence of an infinitesimal `` germ '' with negligible mass and energy .",
    "therefore , what we see actually in the limit @xmath98 are the metastable states .",
    "it is plausible that these metastable states will be selected by the dynamics ( on relevant time scales ) even if states with higher entropy exist .",
    "in fact , depending on its _ topology _",
    "( i.e. , the form of the profile ) an initial condition with @xmath99 can either relax towards the local entropy maximum ( gaseous phase ) or collapse towards the global entropy maximum ( condensed phase ) .",
    "alternatively , for @xmath100 an initially `` condensed '' configuration can remain frozen in this metastable state or explose in a `` gaseous '' state with more entropy .",
    "therefore , the choice of a stable equilibrium state does not only depend whether the equilibrium solution is a local or a global entropy maximum .",
    "it is more dependant whether the initial condition lies in the `` basin of attraction '' of the equilibrium state or not .",
    "the characterization of this basin of attraction requires a nonequilibrium analysis which is not attempted in the present paper .",
    "a first step in that direction was performed by youngkins & miller @xcite by using a one - dimensional spherical shell model and by chavanis _",
    "@xcite with the aid of a simple relaxation equation derived from a maximum entropy production principle @xcite .",
    "these preliminary works reveal that the structure of this basin of attraction is extremely complex so that the final state of the system can not be easily predicted from the initial condition when several equilibrium states exist .",
    "in addition , the structure of this basin of attraction depends whether the system is described by the microcanonical or by the canonical ensemble @xcite",
    ".    however , for @xmath101 the metastable phase completely disapears and , in that case , the system _ must _ necessarily collapse .",
    "this transition is associated to what has been traditionally called the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' @xcite in the case of classical point masses . for systems described by the fermi - dirac statistics ,",
    "the core ultimately ceases to shrink when it becomes degenerate . in that case",
    ", the system falls on to the global entropy maximum ( points d ) which is the true equilibrium state for these systems .",
    "this global entropy maximum has a `` core - halo '' structure , with a degenerate core and a non degenerate halo .",
    "this phase transition is sometimes called a zeroth order phase transition @xcite since it is associated with a discontinuous jump of entropy ( in the classical limit , the entropy of the condensed phase is infinite ) .",
    "in fact , this does not correspond to a true phase transition ( in the usual sense ) , not even to an instability but simply to the sudden disapearance of the `` gaseous '' phase .",
    "it has to be noted that the degenerate nucleus resulting from this gravitational collapse has a relatively important mass and a very small radius ( for @xmath89 and @xmath102 , we have typically @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "this massive nucleus ( `` fermion star '' ) can have important astrophysical implications and , in the context of dark matter , may mimick the effect of a black hole at the center of galaxies ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_astro ] ) .",
    "when the degeneracy parameter is sufficiently small , there exists only one critical point of entropy for each value of energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fel ] ) and it is a global entropy maximum .",
    "therefore , a sufficiently strong degeneracy suppresses the phase transitions in the microcanonical ensemble , including the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' ( see fig .",
    "[ multimu ] ) . for high energies ( small values of @xmath64 ) the solutions almost coincide with the classical isothermal spheres .",
    "when the energy is lowered ( large values of @xmath64 ) the solutions take a `` core - halo '' structure with a partially degenerate nucleus surrounded by a dilute maxwellian atmosphere .",
    "it is now possible to overcome the critical energy @xmath106 and the critical density contrast @xmath107 found by antonov @xcite for classical particles . in that region ,",
    "the specific heat is negative , which is allowed in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "as energy decreases further , more and more mass is concentrated into the nucleus ( which becomes more and more degenerate ) until a minimum accessible energy , corresponding to @xmath108 , at which the nucleus contains all the mass . in that case , the atmosphere has been `` swallowed '' and the system has the same structure as a cold white dwarf star @xcite .",
    "this is a relatively singular limit since the density drops to zero at a finite radius whereas for partially degenerate systems , the density decays like @xmath109 at large distances .",
    "we can study the formation of this compact object by defining an order parameter @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the radius of the sphere which contains @xmath112 of the mass @xcite .",
    "this parameter is ploted as a function of energy in fig .",
    "[ kappa ] and the diagram is similar to the one obtained by follana & laliena @xcite with a different regularization of the potential at the origin . for high energies , the density varies smoothly with the distance and @xmath113 . for low energies",

    "in fact , this `` second order phase transition '' is not really a phase transition ; it just corresponds to the `` clustering '' of the self - gravitating gas as its energy is progressively reduced .",

    "in addition , our model can also describe the phase transitions in the microcanonical ensemble ( occuring for sufficiently small values of the cut - off @xmath259 ) which was not considered by aronson and hansen .",
    "the study of aronson & hansen was reconsidered by stahl _",
    "et al . _ @xcite who pointed out that the van der waals equation of state does not adequately describe hard spheres systems at high densities .",
    "they considered a more general equation of state and studied in detail the case of small filling factors for which a phase transition occurs in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "they also determined numerically the dependance of the transition temperature ( in the canonical ensemble ) as a function of the filling factor and considered applications of their results in the context of planet formation .",
    "following the works of aronson and hansen @xcite and stahl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , different authors have attempted to describe phase transitions in self - gravitating systems by introducing a small scale regularization of the gravitational potential .",
    "for example , in the study of follana & laliena @xcite , the softening is achieved by truncating to @xmath5 terms an expansion of the newtonian potential in spherical bessel functions .",
    "these authors obtained an equilibrium phase diagram similar to the one in fig .",
    "however , they could not achieve very large values of @xmath5 in their study so that they were unable to see the development of the spiral ( and the corresponding phase transition in the microcanonical ensemble ) as @xmath62 .",
    "another analysis of phase transitions in self - gravitating systems was provided by youngkins & miller @xcite with a one - dimensional model of concentric spherical mass shells .",
    "they studied this system in the microcanonical , canonical and grand canonical ensembles both numerically and analytically in the meanfield approximation .",
    "they found an overall good agreement between their numerical simulations and the meanfield predictions .",
    "they observed phase transitions in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles but not in the grand canonical ensemble in which the system remains homogeneous .",
    "this last result may be , however , an artefact of their one - dimensional model .",
    "it is plausible that , in the grand canonical ensemble , the self - gravitating gas fragments in a series of clumps ( at different scales ) as observed in cosmology and for the interstellar medium . some theoretical arguments in favour of this scenario have been given by semelin _",
    "_ @xcite and chavanis @xcite .",
    "of course , to study the development of these clumps , it is necessary to extend the thermodynamical analysis to the full three dimensional problem and relax the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "the thermodynamics of self - gravitating fermions was investigated by lynden - bell & wood and hertel & thirring in the early seventies ( see the discussion of aronson & hansen @xcite ) , but these papers were apparently not published . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is proved that a rigorous thermodynamic limit exists for self - gravitating fermions but the corresponding phase diagram is not explicitly given .",
    "this equilibrium phase diagram was calculated by bilic & viollier @xcite for a particular value of the degeneracy parameter adapted to a cosmological settling .",
    "it was also calculated independantly by chavanis & sommeria @xcite for an arbitrary degree of degeneracy in the context of the theory of `` violent relaxation '' . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the development of the spiral for high values of the degeneracy parameter and the associated phase transition that occurs in the microcanonical ensemble ( in addition to the more well - known phase transition in the canonical ensemble ) was clearly shown .",
    "however , the point of transition was not explicitly determined and this has been done in the present study .",
    "the application of the hard spheres model in astrophysics could concern the fragmentation of the interstellar medium and the formation of stars or even smaller objects such as planets @xcite .",
    "these objects would correspond to the `` condensate '' that results from the collapse of a cloud of gas or dust . on the other hand",
    ", the model of self - gravitating fermions could have applications for massive neutrinos in dark matter models @xcite , white dwarfs @xcite and neutron stars @xcite . by cooling below a critical temperature ,",
    "a condensed phase emerges consisting of a completely degenerate nucleus surrounded by a dilute enveloppe , as extensively studied in early models of stellar structure @xcite .",
    "this model could also be relevant for the `` violent relaxation '' of collisionless stellar systems ) [ or eq .",
    "( [ fd7 ] ) ] is unlikely to be reached throughout the whole cluster .",
    "however , it is reasonable to hold in the central region in which violent relaxation occurs most violently @xcite . ] such as elliptical galaxies @xcite . in that case",
    ", the exclusion principle is a consequence of the liouville theorem .",
    "since degeneracy can stabilize the system without changing its overall structure at large distances , we have suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that degeneracy could play a role in galactic nuclei .",
    "the recent simulations of leeuwin & athanassoula @xcite and the theoretical model of stiavelli @xcite are consistent with this idea especially if the nucleus of elliptical galaxies contains a primordial massive black hole .",
    "indeed , the effect of degeneracy ( in the sense of lynden - bell ) on the distribution of stars surrounding the black hole can explain the cusps observed at the center of galaxies .",
    "whether or not elliptical galaxies are degenerate remains however a matter of debate because when the core becomes dense , two - body encounters will come into play and break the liouville theorem ( shu s criticism @xcite ) .",
    "this form of degeneracy may , however , be relevant for massive neutrinos in dark matter models where it competes with quantum degeneracy @xcite .",
    "in fact , the thermal equilibrium distribution of massive neutrinos in dark matter models might be justified more by the process of `` violent relaxation '' than by a collisional relaxation .",
    "indeed , the time scale of gravitational two - body encounters for neutrinos is extremely long so that the criticism raised by shu does not apply @xcite .",
    "therefore , the commonly adopted fermi - dirac distribution of self - gravitating neutrinos might be due to lynden - bell s type of degeneracy rather than to quantum mechanics . anyway , whatever the source of the exclusion principle ( lynden - bell or pauli ) , the self - gravitating fermi - dirac model predicts the formation of a dense degenerate nucleus ( `` fermion star '' ) with a small radius and a large mass @xcite . as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , this dense degenerate nucleus could be an alternative to black holes at the center of galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , at large distances , the density of the ( isothermal ) self - gravitating fermi gas decays like @xmath109 which is a condition that dark galactic halos must fulfill in order to reproduce the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , this model of self - gravitating fermions has a chance to account for the structure of dark matter in galactic halos .",
    "in this paper , we have described the inequivalence of statistical ensembles and the nature of phase transitions in self - gravitating systems by considering the case of self - gravitating fermions or the case of a classical hard spheres gas .",
    "the introduction of an effective repulsion at short distances avoids the singularity of the `` naked '' gravitational potential .",
    "it is likely that similar results will be obtained with different forms of the regularization . for large values of the cut - off @xmath259 ,",
    "there are no phase transition . for intermediate values of @xmath259",
    ", phase transtions occur in the canonical ensemble but not in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is of the type of fig .",
    "[ fel ] and has been found by various authors @xcite . for smaller values of @xmath259 ,",
    "phase transitions occur both in the canonical and in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is of the type of fig .",
    "[ le5 ] and was first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . as the small - scale cut - off is decreased",
    ", the @xmath307 curve winds up and tends to the classical spiral for @xmath314 ( see fig . [ etalambda ] ) .",
    "depending on the value of the cut - off @xmath259 and of the ensemble considered ( microcanonical or canonical ) , three kinds of phase transitions can be evidenced which separate a `` gaseous '' phase from a `` condensed '' phase . in the microcanonical ensemble and for sufficiently small @xmath259 ( fig .",
    "[ le5 ] ) , a gravitational first order phase transition occurs at an energy @xmath315 at which the `` gaseous '' states pass from global to local entropy maxima and the `` condensed '' states from local to global entropy maxima .",
    "this transition is marked by a discontinuity of the temperature and of the specific heats . in the limit @xmath314",
    ", the transition energy is rejected to @xmath225 , so that the stable ( gaseous ) solutions of the classical spiral are only _",
    "metastable_. these states may be physical depending whether the initial condition lies in their `` basin of attraction '' or not @xcite .",
    "however , the metastable branch disappears at a critical energy @xmath316 , discovered by antonov @xcite , at which the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' @xcite occurs .",
    "this collapse can be considered as a zeroth order phase transition since it is associated with a discontinuity of entropy . for larger values of @xmath259 , there is only one entropy maximum for each value of energy ( fig [ fel ] ) and the previously described phase transitions are suppressed . however , as we progressively decrease energy , the self - gravitating gas acheives higher and higher density contrasts and builds up a compact core containing more and more mass .",
    "this gravitational `` clustering '' can be called a second order phase transition since the specific heats diverges at the critical point and the order parameter experiences a rapid variation in the region of negative specific heats ( but remains continuous ) .",
    "similar phase transitions occur in the canonical ensemble .",
    "it is interesting that these phase transitions can be understood with the aid of a simple analytical model which allows one to determine the dependance of the thermodynamical parameters with the cut - off value .",
    "the present study can be extended to include rotation ( in preparation ) .",
    "it is also important to develop non equilibrium models to determine the structure of the `` basin of attraction '' of the equilibrium states when several solutions exist .",
    "a first step in that direction was made by youngkins & miller @xcite and by chavanis _",
    "@xcite with the aid of simplified dynamical models .",
    "these models could be used in particular to investigate numerically the occurence of the phase transitions and the robustness of the metastable states .",
    "if the system is placed in a metastable state ( local entropy maximum ) , it will eventually jump to the global entropy maximum , but this can take an infinite ( physically irrelevant ) time . indeed , the probability that a fluctuation will allow the phase transition to develop is expected to be extremely low ( except maybe near the critical point ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the system is trapped in a metastable state ( but still slowly evolving along the series of equilibrium by losing mass or energy like for globular clusters ) , the phase transition will occur at the critical point @xmath317 rather than at @xmath318 .",
    "however , if the system is initially far from equilibrium , there is no simple criterion to decide a priori whether it will converge towards the local or the global entropy maximum .",
    "only direct numerical simulations can answer this question and sketch the structure of the basin of attraction for self - gravitating systems .",
    "i acknowledge interesting discussions with n. bilic , t. dauxois , o. fliegans , v. laliena , d. lynden - bell , c. sire and j. sommeria .",
    "special thanks are due to j. katz for useful comments on this manuscript during his visit in toulouse .",
    "i have also benefited from precious discussions with s. ruffo , j. barr and f. bouchet during my stay at the university of firenze ( october 2001 ) .",
