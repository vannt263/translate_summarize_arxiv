    "the social web has changed the way people create and use information .",
    "sites like flickr , del.icio.us , youtube , and others , allow users to publish and organize content by annotating it with descriptive keywords , or tags .",
    "some web sites also enable users to organize content hierarchically .",
    "the photo - sharing site flickr , for example , allows users to group related photos in sets , and related sets in collections .",
    "although these types of social metadata lack formal structure , they capture the collective knowledge of social web users . once mined from the traces left by many users",
    ", such collective knowledge will add a rich semantic layer to the content of the social web that will potentially support many tasks in information discovery such as personalization , data mining , and information management .",
    "a community s knowledge can be expressed through a common taxonomy , also called a _ folksonomy _",
    ", that is learned from social metadata created by many users . compared to existing hierarchies , such as linnaean classification system or wordnet ,",
    "automatically learned folksonomies are attractive because they ( 1 ) represent collective agreement of many individuals ; ( 2 ) are relatively inexpensive to obtain ; ( 3 ) can adapt to evolving vocabularies and community s information needs ; and ( 4 ) they are directly tied to the annotated content .",
    "a folksonomy can facilitate browsing of user - generated content , and help users visualize how their own content fits within the community s or aid them in organizing it .    learning a folksonomy by integrating structured metadata created by many users",
    "presents a number of challenges .",
    "since users are free to annotate data according to their own preferences , social metadata is _ noisy _ , _ shallow _ , _ sparse _ , _ ambiguous _ , _ conflicting _ , _ multi - faceted _ , and expressed at _ inconsistent granularity levels _ across many users .",
    "several recent works have addressed some of the above challenges .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposed inducing folksonomies from tags by utilizing tag statistics .",
    "the basic motivation behind these approaches is that more frequent tags describe more general concepts .",
    "however , frequency - based methods can not distinguish between more general and more popular concepts . in our previous work ,  @xcite",
    ", we overcame this problem by using user - specified relations , extracted from personal hierarchies .",
    "nevertheless , it ignored other evidence , e.g. , structure of hierarchies and tags , which potentially address the challenges listed above .",
    "we propose a novel approach to learn folksonomies from social metadata in the form of tags and user - specified shallow hierarchies .",
    "our approach is driven by a similarity measure that utilizes statistics of both kinds of metadata to incrementally weave individual hierarchies into a deeper , more complete folksonomy .",
    "the approach has several advantages over previous work .",
    "specifically , it : ( 1 ) better addresses the challenges of sparse , shallow , ambiguous , noisy and inconsistent data ; ( 2 ) the approach is more scalable , especially when the learned folksonomies are deep ; ( 3 ) it produces more consistent and richer folksonomies .",
    "we demonstrate the utility of our present approach on real - world data from flickr , and introduce a simple metric , which evaluates the quality of the learned folksonomies in terms of depth and bushiness .",
    "in addition to tagging content , some social web sites also allow users to organize it hierarchically .",
    "_ delicious _ users can group related tags into bundles , and _ flickr _ users can group related photos into _ sets _ and then group related sets in _ collections_. while the sites themselves do not impose any constraints on the vocabulary or semantics of the hierarchies , in practice users employ them to represent both subclass relationships ( ` dog ' is a kind of ` mammal ' ) and part - of relationship ( ` my kids ' is a part of ` family ' ) .",
    "users appear to express both types of relations ( and possibly others ) through personal hierarchies , in effect using the hierarchies to specify broader / narrower relations . even without strict semantics being attached to these relations",
    ", we believe that personal hierarchies represent a novel , rich source of evidence for learning folksonomies .",
    "cccc +   +   &   + ( b ) & ( c ) +    we briefly describe how this feature is implemented on the social photo - sharing site , _ flickr _ ( ` http://www.flickr.com ` ) .",
    "flickr allows users to group their photos in album - like folders , called _",
    "sets_. users can also group sets into `` super '' albums , called _ collections_. both sets and collections are named by the owner of the image .",
    "a photo can be part of multiple sets .    while flickr does not enforce any specific rules about how to organize photos or how to name them , most users group `` similar '' or `` related '' photos into the same set and related sets into the same collection .",
    "some users create multi - level hierarchies containing collections of collections , etc . , but the vast majority of users create shallow hierarchies , consisting of collections and their constituent sets .",
    "figure  [ fig : collections](a ) shows some of the collections created by an avid naturalist on flickr .",
    "these collections reflect the subjects she likes to photograph : , , , , , , etc .",
    "figure  [ fig : collections](b ) shows sets of the collection : , , , and .",
    "each set contains one or more photos , which are tagged by the user .",
    "for example , a photograph in the set ( figure  [ fig : collections](c ) ) , is annotated with multiple tags describing it:(`animal ` , ` lepidoptera ` , ` moth ` , ` larva ` , ` caterpillar ` ) , its color ( ` black and orange ` ) , condition ( ` on senecio ` , ` eating ` ) , and location ( ` north seatac park ` , ` king county ` , ` wa ` , ` north america ` ) .",
    "learning folksonomies from social metadata , specifically , from structured metadata , presents a number of challenges :    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in all , the proposed approach , , has several advantages over the baseline , .",
    "first , it exploits both structure information and tag statistics to combine relevant saplings , which can produce more comprehensive folksonomies as well as resolve ambiguity of the concept names .",
    "second , it allows similar concepts to appear multiple times within the same hierarchy .",
    "for example , allows the ` anim ` folksonomy to have both ` anim ` @xmath0 ` pet ` @xmath0 ` cat ` and ` anim ` @xmath0 ` mammal ` @xmath0 ` cat ` paths , while only one of these paths is retained by .",
    "last , can identify synonyms from structure ( loops ) .",
    "we learned the following synonyms from flickr data : \\{`anim ` , ` creatur ` , ` critter ` , ` all anim ` , ` wildlife ` } and \\{`insect ` , ` bug`}.",
    "constructing ontological relations from text has long interested researchers , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "many of these methods exploit linguistic patterns to infer if two keywords are related under a certain relationship . however , these approaches are not applicable to social metadata because it is usually _ ungrammatical _ and much more _ inconsistent _ than natural language text .",
    "several researchers have investigated various techniques to construct conceptual hierarchies from social metadata .",
    "most of the previous work utilizes tag statistics as evidence .",
    "mika  @xcite uses a graph - based approach to construct a network of related tags , projected from either a user - tag or object - tag association graphs ; then induces broader / narrower relations using betweenness centrality and set theory .",
    "other works apply clustering techniques to tags , and use their co - occurrence statistics to produce conceptual hierarchies  @xcite . heymann and garcia - molina  @xcite use centrality in the similarity graph of tags .",
    "the tag with the highest centrality is considered more abstract than one with a lower centrality ; thus it should be merged to the hierarchy first , to guarantee that more abstract nodes are closer to the root .",
    "schmitz  @xcite applied a statistical subsumption model  @xcite to induce hierarchical relations among tags .",
    "since these works are based on tag statistics , they are likely to suffer from the `` popularity vs. generality '' problem , where a tag may be used more frequently not because it is more general , but because it is more popular among users .    our present work , , is different from our earlier approach ,  @xcite in many aspects .",
    "first , exploits more evidence , i.e. , structure and tag statistics of personal hierarchies rather than individual relations co - occurrence statistics as in .",
    "second , is based on the relational clustering approach that incrementally attaches relevant saplings to the learned folksonomies , as exhaustively determines the best path out of all possible paths from the root node to a leaf , which is computationally expensive when the learned folksonomies are deep .",
    "last , demonstrates many advantages as presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the sapling merging approach described in this paper is an extension of collective relational clustering approach used for entity resolution @xcite . that work proposed a method to identify and disambiguate entities , such as authors , that utilizes two types of evidence : intrisic and extrinsic features .",
    "intrinsic features are associated with specific instances , such as author names , while extrinsic features are derived from structural evidence , e.g. , co - authors in a citations database .",
    "intuitively , two names refer to the same author if they are similar and their co - author names refer to the same set of authors .",
    "analogously , we identify and disambiguate concept names from names and tags ( intrinsic ) and neighboring nodes features ( extrinsic ) .",
    "however , for efficiency reasons , we use the naive version of the relational clustering , where we directly use the features from neighbors as the extrinsic features , rather than cluster labels .    handling mutual shortcuts by keeping the sapling which is more similar to the ancestor is similar in spirit to the minimum evolution assumption in @xcite .",
    "specifically , a certain hierarchy should not have any sudden changes from a parent to its child concepts .",
    "our approach is also similar to several works on ontology alignment ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , unlike those works , which merge a small number of deep , detailed and consistent concepts , we merge large number of noisy and shallow concepts , which are specified by different users .",
    "this paper describes an approach which incrementally combines a large number of shallow hierarchies specified by different users into common , denser and deeper folksonomies .",
    "the approach addresses the challenges of learning folksonomies from social metadata and demonstrates several advantages over the previous work .",
    "additionally , it is general enough for other domains , such as tags / bundles in _ delicious _ and files / folders in personal workspaces .    for the future work , in addition to automatically separating broader / narrower from related - to relations",
    ", we would like to develop a systematic way to handle individual saplings whose child nodes are from different facets .",
    "this will improve the quality of the learned folksonomies by not mixing concepts from different facets .",
    "we are also working on combining more sources of evidence such as geographical information for learning accurate folksonomies .",
    "lastly , we would like to frame the approach in a fully probabilistic way ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which provides a systematic way to combine heterogeneous evidence , and takes into account uncertainties on similarities between concepts and relations .",
