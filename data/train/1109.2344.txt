    "equation ( [ telegraph ] ) in the absence of a potential field is sometimes referred to the telegrapher equation although we shall call it a non - fickian diffusion equation .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a derivation of ( [ telegraph ] ) from ( [ kramers ] ) .",
    "it may be noted that for times larger than @xmath12 , the first term on the left hand side of ( [ telegraph ] ) can be neglected and the fickian regime is regained .",
    "equation ( [ diffusion ] ) in the absence of a potential field leads to the well known result for the mean square displacement @xcite @xmath13 in the presence of a flexible symmetric potential , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath14 does not necessarily behave linearly with time .",
    "equation ( [ telegraph ] ) retains some short time inertial behaviour of a brownian particle and at long time results in a diffusive behaviour .",
    "the velocity @xmath15 of a brownian particle is not well defined in the diffusive regime for which ( [ diffusion ] ) is applicable . since ( [ telegraph ] ) is applicable in an inertial regime , the velocity can be calculated with ( [ telegraph ] ) .",
    "quite recently the instantaneous velocity of a brownian particle has been experimentally investigated @xcite .",
    "this provides an additional motivation for studying ( [ telegraph ] ) .",
    "there is also a recent paper @xcite which models transport of ions in insulating media through a non - fickian diffusion equation of the type discussed in our work . in @xcite the non - fickian diffusion equation",
    "is referred to as a hyperbolic diffusion equation .    to solve our problem we consider a numerical method based on space discretization and time laplace transform .",
    "the latter is suitable for long times and also for solutions that are not necessarily smooth in time .",
    "it may be noted that iterative methods in time , including implicit methods such as the crank- nicolson @xcite , which allows a choice of large time steps , usually take too long to compute the solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model problem in dimensionless variables . in section 3",
    "we describe a numerical method based on the time laplace transform which is suitable for long time integration and also for solutions which are not very smooth . in section 4",
    "the convergence properties of the algorithm are studied . in section 5",

    "we conclude the paper , in section 6 , with a summary and outlook .",
    "in our studies we consider three quantities of physical interest .",
    "these are the particle density  @xmath16 ,  the  current  density  ( flux )  @xmath17 and  the  mean square  displacement @xmath14 .",
    "the current density is not normally studied . however , since we are dealing with a non - fickian diffusion equation we have decided to consider @xmath18 as well . for the fickian case and in the absence of any potential , @xmath18 is related to @xmath19 through @xmath20 .",

    "our approach can be separated in three steps .",
    "first , we apply the laplace transform to ( [ telegraph_dim])([flux_dim ] ) in order to remove the time dependent terms and we obtain an ordinary differential equation in @xmath41 that also depends on the laplace transform parameter @xmath42 .",
    "secondly , we solve the ordinary differential equation obtained using a finite difference scheme .",
    "lastly , using a numerical inverse laplace transform algorithm we obtain the final approximate solution .",

    "we show that the full method is second order accurate ; this finding receives additional support from two test examples considered in section 4 .",
    "one may be able to consider further improvement . a major advantage of using the time laplace transform is that we can compute the approximate solution for long times accurately and quickly .",
    "any iterative numerical method would take too long to compute the solution for similar times even if we consider an unconditionally implicit numerical method which will allow large time steps .",
    "additionally , our algorithm takes into consideration the smoothness of the solution ; in other words the computational effort is higher in the regions where the solution has steep gradients .",
    "another merit of the method is that it can be easily generalized to higher spatial dimensions .",
    "it would be of interest to consider an application of the method to numerically solve the kramers equation which is a more involved partial differential equation than the non - fickian diffusion equation .",
