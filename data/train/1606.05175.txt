    "the _ recombination equation _ is a well - known dynamical system from mathematical population genetics @xcite , which describes the evolution of the genetic composition of a population that evolves under recombination .",
    "the genetic composition is described via a probability distribution ( or measure ) on a space of sequences of finite length , and recombination is the genetic mechanism in which two parent individuals are involved in creating the mixed sequence of their offspring during sexual reproduction .",
    "the model comes in a continuous - time and a discrete - time version .",
    "it can accommodate a variety of different mechanisms by which the genetic material of the offspring is partitioned across its parents . in all cases ,",
    "the resulting equations are nonlinear and notoriously difficult to solve . elucidating the underlying structure and finding solutions",
    "has been a challenge to theoretical population geneticists for nearly a century now .",
    "the first studies go back to jennings in 1917 @xcite and robbins in 1918 @xcite .",
    "geiringer in 1944 @xcite and bennett in 1954 @xcite were the first to state the generic general _",
    "form _ of the solution in terms of a convex combination of certain basis functions , and developed methods for the recursive evaluation of the corresponding coefficients to obtain the solution itself , at least in principle .",
    "the approach was later continued within the systematic framework of genetic algebras ; compare @xcite .",
    "it could be shown that , despite the nonlinearity , the dynamical system may be ( exactly ) transformed into a linear one by embedding it into a higher - dimensional space .",
    "more explicitly , a large number of further components are added that correspond to multilinear transformations of the original measure .",
    "this method is known as _",
    "haldane linearisation _ @xcite . however , this line of research led to astonishingly few concrete or applicable results .",
    "this raises the question whether the program may be completed outside the abstract framework , and what kinds of results can be obtained via different approaches .",
    "a first step forward , for an important special case , was achieved in @xcite , via a rather powerful use of the inclusion - exclusion principle in the form of the mbius inversion formula . at the same time , a general formalism via nonlinear operators , called _",
    "recombinators _ , was introduced that also allowed for an alternative consideration starting from the nonlinear equation with a single such operator and extending this to the same solution @xcite .",
    "after various intermediate steps of gradual generalisations , the complete equation , in the setting of general partitions , was analysed and solved in @xcite . in the generic parameter case ,",
    "the general solution was given in recursive form .",
    "also , the principal form of the solution in degenerate cases was analysed , but no general formula was given .",
    "the most important insight , however , was the identification of an underlying stochastic fragmentation process in ( * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the solution of the nonlinear recombination equation has a representation in terms of the solution of the kolmogorov forward equation for this very process , which is a _ linear _ ode .    in @xcite , the slightly simpler setting of ordered or interval partitions was analysed , with focus on explicit solution formulas for _ all _ parameter values ( thus including the degenerate cases ) for sequences of length up to five . here",
    ", the above - mentioned kolmogorov equation was investigated further , and the markov generator from ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) was derived explicitly .",
    "this demonstrated two important things :    1 .",
    "the solvability of the nonlinear recombination ode ultimately rests upon the fact that this solution essentially also solves a system of linear equations ; 2 .",
    "the degenerate cases are in one - to - one correspondence to the cases where the markov generator fails to be diagonalisable , and the appearance of jordan blocks , well known from classic ode theory , determines the solutions then .",
    "now , with hindsight , one can ask whether one can treat the original nonlinear ode in such a way that this becomes immediately transparent , without resorting to the underlying stochastic process . the answer is affirmative , and",
    "this paper explains how to do it .",
    "effectively , this new approach means to re - interpret the original haldane linearisation in a suitable way , without any need for genetic algebras .",
    "moreover , as we shall see , a completely analogous approach also works for the discrete - time recombination equation .",
    "this paper builds on previous work , most importantly on @xcite .",
    "some of the results from these papers will be freely used below , and not re - derived here ( though we will always provide precise references ) .",
    "also , the biological background is explained in @xcite . after recalling the preliminaries and our notation in section  [ sec : partitions ] , the general recombination equation in continuous time , together with its reduction to subsystems via marginalisation , is discussed in section  [ sec : gen - reco ] .",
    "this is followed by its general solution via our new and simplified strategy ( section  [ sec : fast ] ) , which leads to the first main result in theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "a stratified interpretation in terms of the underlying partitioning process is offered in section  [ sec : partitioning ] , which gives our second main result ( theorem  [ thm : a - part ] ) .",
    "the discrete - time version of the recombination equation is then discussed and solved in section  [ sec : discrete ] , by the same method , which leads to our third main result in theorem  [ thm : discrete ] . the corresponding stochastic process is also identified and briefly summarised .",
