    "heavy - quark production takes place in partonic scatterings during the early stages of the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "the time scale for a @xmath8 pair production is gev fm c@xmath9gev@xmath10 fm / c , which is much smaller than the expected lifetime of the quark gluon plasma fm / c .",
    "thus , heavy quarks are expected to provide information about the hottest initial phase .",
    "the measurement of d mesons can be used to extract the charm production cross section .",
    "the measurement of charm cross section in both pp and aa collisions is useful to evaluate the scaling mechanisms which govern the charm production from pp to aa collisions .",
    "several nuclear effects can break the binary scaling estimated on a geometrical basis with the glauber model  @xcite .",
    "they are divided into two classes : initial- and final - state effects .",
    "the former , such as nuclear shadowing , affect heavy - quark production by modifying the parton distribution functions in the nucleus .",
    "the latter can be due to the interactions of the partons in the medium .",
    "they affect heavy - quark production by modifying the fragmentation function .",
    "energy loss of the partons and development of anisotropic flow are among such processes .",
    "a benchmark study was performed on the reconstruction of d@xmath0 mesons in the @xmath11 decay channel  @xcite .",
    "the study of ratios such as d@xmath12d@xmath0 , d@xmath13d@xmath0 , d@xmath13d@xmath1 provide information on the hadronization mechanisms .",
    "in addition , the reconstruction of as many charmed states as possible ( d@xmath0 , d@xmath1 , d@xmath14 , @xmath3 ,  ) is required in order to reduce the systematic errors on the charm cross section .",
    "the detection of charmed particles is possible in alice thanks to the good expected performance of the central barrel detectors , namely the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the time of flight detector ( tof ) .",
    "the alice barrel is embedded in a magnetic field , b=0.5 t , oriented along the beam axis ( @xmath15-axis ) .",
    "the tracks are curved in the transverse plane ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the expected @xmath4 resolution is @xmath17 , the primary vertex resolution is expected to be @xmath18 @xmath19 m ( in case of pb - pb ) and the expected resolution on the minimum @xmath16 distance of the prolonged track with respect to the primary vertex ( impact parameter ) is @xmath20 @xmath19 m for @xmath21 gev / c .",
    "alice provides charged hadron identification from momenta of about 0.3 gev / c to about 3 gev / c .",
    "an accurate measurement of secondary vertices is important because the weakly decaying charm states have typical decay lengths of the order of hundreds @xmath19 m .",
    "the method for the reconstruction of secondary vertices originated by 3-prong decays is based on the straight line approximation of the tracks , i.e. each track which is curved by the magnetic field is approximated by a straight line in the vicinity of the primary vertex .",
    "the algorithm finds the point of minimum distance between three straight lines by minimizing the quantity @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the coordinates of the secondary vertex and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the errors on the track parameters . at high @xmath4 of the d@xmath1 , its decay products get more and more collinear with the d meson @xmath4 . hence , along this direction a worsening of the resolution of the secondary vertex finder should be observed .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vert ] , where the rms is calculated in a reference system in the bending plane in which @xmath28 is the direction of the @xmath4 of the d@xmath1 and @xmath29 is the axis orthogonal to @xmath28 . along the @xmath28",
    "coordinate the rms increases at high @xmath4 , while in the @xmath29 coordinate the rms goes down to @xmath30 @xmath19 m .",
    "the expected number of d@xmath1 in a central pb - pb event is @xmath31 in @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "we generated separately signal and background events .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained with a sample of 20  000 central hijing ( d@xmath33/d@xmath29=6000 ) events and @xmath34 signal triplets generated with pythia .",
    "the signal events have approximately the same particle multiplicity as the central hijing events .",
    "a sample of @xmath35 minimum bias pp events was generated with pythia ; due to the smaller cpu time needed to simulate and reconstruct pp events compared to pb - pb , a separate generation of signal and background events was not necessary .",
    "the cuts presented in the following are optimized in order to maximize the significance @xmath36 in the invariant mass range @xmath37  mev / c@xmath38 .",
    "the strategy is based on a series of selection steps .",
    "the first selection is done on the single tracks before they are combined into triplets and passed to the secondary vertex finding algorithm .",
    "the goal is to reduce the number af all the possible combinations of tracks into triplets in a central pb - pb collision .",
    "this number is @xmath39 10@xmath40 without any initial cut and it must be cut before using the vertexer .",
    "the best combination of cuts which preserves the @xmath4 spectrum of d@xmath41 mesons down to @xmath42 gev / c is defined by @xmath43 gev / c , @xmath44 gev / c and @xmath45 @xmath19 m ( @xmath46 is the distance of closest approach of the track to the primary vertex in the bending plane ) ; with such a choice , the number of combinatorial background triplets per event is reduced to @xmath47 . the second selection takes place before the triplets are passed to the vertexer and it is based on a cut on the distance @xmath48 between the primary vertex and the secondary vertex of two opposite charged tracks .",
    "the chosen value of @xmath49 is @xmath50 @xmath19 m .",
    "the triplets satisfying specific requirements on combinations of track impact parameters are then selected and the secondary vertex finding is applied . a selection based on the track dispersion",
    "is performed ( @xmath51 has the meaning of a standard deviation . ] ) .",
    "the right - hand plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : vert ] reports the fraction of accepted triplets ( both signal and background ) with @xmath52 , for d@xmath41 transverse momentum @xmath53 gev / c .",
    "the value @xmath54 has been tuned in various intervals of d@xmath41 transverse momentum ; it is of the order of 200 @xmath19 m .       in conclusion",
    ", the reconstruction of the channel @xmath22 seems to be feasible with a good significance both in pb - pb and in pp collisions . in the likely case in which the multiplicity in central pb - pb events turned out to be lower ,",
    "the significance would of course improve .",
    "the analysis on @xmath55 is feasible in one year of data taking .",
    "the statistical error bars for the measurement of @xmath56 as a function of the transverse momentum in one year of data taking are a bit large . the use of a semi - peripheral trigger and the use of the d meson statistics collected in several years would improve the situation .      0 r.j .  glauber and g.  matthiae , _ nucl .",
