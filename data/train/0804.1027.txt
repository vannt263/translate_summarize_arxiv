    "continuous state branching processes ( csbp ) were first introduced by jirina @xcite and it is known since lamperti @xcite that these processes are the scaling limits of galton - watson processes .",
    "they hence model the evolution of a large population on a long time interval .",
    "the law of such a process is characterized by the so - called branching mechanism function @xmath0",
    ". we will be interested mainly in critical or sub - critical csbp . in those cases , the branching mechanism @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the lvy measure @xmath4 is a positive @xmath5-finite measure on @xmath6 such that @xmath7 .",
    "we shall say that the branching mechanism @xmath0 has parameter @xmath8 .",
    "let us recall that @xmath9 represents a drift term , @xmath10 is a diffusion coefficient and @xmath4 describes the jumps of the csbp .    as for discrete galton - watson processes , we can associate with a csbp a genealogical tree , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "these trees can be considered as continuum random trees ( crt ) in the sense that the branching points along a branch form a dense subset .",
    "we call the genealogical tree associated with a branching mechanism @xmath0 the @xmath0-lvy crt ( the term `` lvy '' will be explained later ) .",
    "the prototype of such a tree is the brownian crt introduced by aldous @xcite .    in a discrete setting , it is easy to consider and study a percolation on the tree ( for instance , see @xcite for percolation on the branches of a galton - watson tree , or @xcite for percolation on the nodes of a galton - watson tree ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to introduce a general pruning procedure of a genealogical tree associated with a branching mechanism @xmath0 of the form ( [ eq : psi ] ) , which is the continuous analogue of the previous percolation ( although no link is actually made between both ) .",
    "we first add some marks on the skeleton of the tree according to a poisson measure with intensity @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the length measure on the tree ( see the definition of that measure further ) and @xmath13 is a non - negative parameter . we next add some marks on the nodes of infinite index of the tree : with such a node @xmath14 is associated a `` weight '' say @xmath15 ( see later for a formal definition ) , each infinite node is then marked with probability @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a non - negative measurable function satisfying the integrability condition @xmath18 we then prune the tree according to these marks and consider the law of the pruned subtree containing the root .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following theorem :    [ thm : pruned_crt ] let @xmath0 be a ( sub)-critical branching mechanism of the form ( [ eq : psi ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath19 and set @xmath20 which is again a branching mechanism of a critical or subcritical csbp .",
    "then , the pruned subtree is a lvy - crt with branching mechanism @xmath21 .    in order to make the previous statement more rigorous",

    "this construction can be extended to more general measurable functions .    in order to define a random tree , instead of taking a tree - valued random variable",
    ", it suffices to take a stochastic process for @xmath48 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath48 is a normalized brownian excursion , the associated real tree is aldous crt @xcite .",
    "the construction of a height process that codes a tree associated with a general branching mechanism is due to le gall and le jan @xcite .",

    "if we set @xmath70 the local time time of the process @xmath69 at level @xmath44 and time @xmath71 and @xmath72 , then the process @xmath73 is a csbp starting from @xmath74 with branching mechanism @xmath0 and the tree with height process @xmath69 can be viewed as the genealogical tree of this csbp .",

    "we consider a preemptive lifo ( last in , first out ) queue with one server .",
    "a jump of @xmath58 at time @xmath14 corresponds to the arrival of a new customer requiring a service equal to @xmath85 .",
    "the server interrupts his current job and starts immediately the service of this new customer ( preemptive lifo procedure ) .",
    "when this new service is finished , the server will resume the previous job .",
    "when @xmath4 is infinite , all services will suffer interruptions",
    ". the customer ( arrived at time ) @xmath14 will still be in the system at time @xmath86 if and only if @xmath87 and , in this case , the quantity @xmath88 represents the remaining service required by the customer @xmath14 at time @xmath71 .",
    "observe that @xmath89)$ ] corresponds to the load of the server at time @xmath71 and is equal to @xmath90 where @xmath91    in view of the markov property of @xmath83 and the poisson representation of lemma [ lem : dlg - decomp ] , we can view @xmath92 as a measure placed on the ancestral line of the individual labeled by @xmath71 which gives the intensity of the sub - trees that are grafted `` on the right '' of this ancestral line .",
    "the continuous part of the measure @xmath92 gives binary branching points ( i.e. vertex in the tree of degree 3 ) which are dense along that ancestral line since the excursion measure @xmath93 that appears in lemma [ lem : dlg - decomp ] is an infinite measure , whereas the atomic part of the measure @xmath92 gives nodes of infinite degree for the same reason .",
    "consequently , the nodes of the tree coded by @xmath69 are of two types : nodes of degree 3 and nodes of infinite degree . moreover , we see that each node of infinite degree corresponds to a jump of the lvy process @xmath58 and so we associate to such a node a `` weight '' given by the height of the corresponding jump of @xmath58 ( this will be formally stated in section [ sec : lps ] ) . from now - on",
    ", we will only handle the exploration process although we will often use vocabulary taken from the real tree ( coded by this exploration process ) .",
    "in particular , the theorems will be stated in terms of the exploration process and also hold when @xmath69 is not continuous .",
    "we now consider the lvy crt associated with a general critical or sub - critical branching mechanism @xmath0 ( or rather the exploration process that codes that tree ) and we add marks on the tree .",
    "there will be two kinds of marks : some marks will be set only on nodes of infinite degrees whereas the others will be uniformly distributed on the skeleton on the tree .",
    "let @xmath94 $ ] be a measurable function satisfying condition ( [ eq : cond - p ] ) .",
    "recall that each node of infinite degree of the tree is associated with a jump @xmath95 of the process @xmath58 .",
    "conditionally on @xmath58 , we mark such a node with probability @xmath16 , independently of the other nodes .",
    "let @xmath13 be a non - negative constant .",
    "the marks associated with these parameters will be distributed on the skeleton of the tree according to a poisson point measure with intensity @xmath96 ( recall that @xmath12 denotes the one - dimensional hausdorff measure on the tree ) .      as we do nt use the real trees framework but only the exploration processes that codes the lvy crts",
    ", we must describe all these marks in term of exploration processes .",
    "therefore , we define a measure - valued process @xmath97 called the marked exploration process where the process @xmath83 is the usual exploration process whereas the processes @xmath98 and @xmath99 keep track of the marks , respectively on the nodes and on the skeleton of the tree .",
    "the measure @xmath100 is just the sum of the dirac measure of the marked nodes ( up to some weights for technical reasons ) which are the ancestors of @xmath71 .    to define the measure",
    "@xmath101 , we first consider a lvy snake @xmath102 with spatial motion @xmath103 a poisson process of parameter @xmath13 ( see @xcite , chapter 4 for the definition of a lvy snake ) .",
    "we then define the measure @xmath101 as the derivative of the function @xmath104 .",
    "let us remark that in @xcite , the height process is supposed to be continuous for the construction of lvy snakes .",
    "we explain in the appendix how to remove this technical assumption .",
    "we denote by @xmath105 the lebesgue measure of the set of the individuals prior to @xmath71 whose lineage does not contain any mark i.e. @xmath106 we consider its right - continuous inverse @xmath107 and we define the pruned exploration process @xmath108 by @xmath109    in other words , we remove from the crt all the individuals who have a marked ancestor , and the exploration process @xmath108 codes the remaining tree",
    ".    we can now restate theorem [ thm : pruned_crt ] rigorously in terms of exploration processes .",
    "[ thm : law_pruned_bref ] the pruned exploration process @xmath110 is distributed as the exploration process associated with a lvy process with laplace exponent @xmath21 .",

    ", the special markov property gives the conditional distribution of the individuals with marked ancestors with respect to the tree of individuals with no marked ancestors .",
    "this result is of independent interest .",
    "notice the proof of this result in the general setting is surprisingly much more involved than the previous two particular cases : the quadratic case ( see proposition 6 in @xcite or proposition 7 in @xcite ) and the case without quadratic term ( see theorem 3.12 in @xcite ) .    finally , we give the joint law of the length of the excursion of the exploration process and the length of the excursion of the pruned exploration process , see proposition [ prop : s - sq ] .      a first approach for this construction",
    "is to consider the csbp @xmath111 associated with the pruned exploration process @xmath108 as an initial eve - population which undergoes some neutral mutations ( the marks on the genealogical tree ) and the csbp @xmath112 denotes the total population ( the eve - one and the mutants ) associated with the exploration process",
    "we see that , from our construction , we have @xmath113 the condition @xmath114 means that , when the population @xmath111 jumps , so does the population @xmath112 . by these remarks , we can see that our pruning procedure is quite general .",
    "let us however remark that the coefficient diffusion @xmath10 is the same for @xmath0 and @xmath21 which might imply that more general prunings exist ( in particular , we would like to remove some of the vertices of index 3 ) .    as we consider general critical or sub - critical branching mechanism",

    "let us remark that this paper goes along the same general ideas as @xcite ( the theorems and the intermediate lemmas are the same ) but the proofs of each of them are more involved and use quite different techniques based on martingale problem .",
    "this work has also others applications .",
    "our method separates in fact the genealogical tree associated with @xmath112 into several components .",
    "for some values of the parameters of the pruning procedure , we can construct via our pruning procedure , a fragmentation process as defined by bertoin @xcite but which is not self - similar , see for instance @xcite . on the other hand",
