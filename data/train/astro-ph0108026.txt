    "it is now generally accepted that the elemental composition of the solar wind is different from that of the photosphere .",
    "three decades of research have shown that in the slow speed solar wind ( which is believed to originate from quiet coronal regions ) the abundance ratio of low first ionization potential ( fip ) elements ( fip @xmath3 ev ) relative to higher fip elements is larger than it is in the photosphere .",
    "the observed fip enhancement is roughly a factor of four . with the advent of the ulysses spacecraft in its polar orbit ,",
    "it has become clear that in the fast solar wind ( which emanates from coronal holes ) the enhancement of the low fip elements is certainly less than two , and is perhaps consistent with the solar photospheric abundance pattern @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena are observed in spectroscopic studies of the solar corona and transition region , which we will refer to as the solar upper atmosphere .",
    "mapping the fip enhancement factor from the solar wind , through the corona and transition region , and into the photosphere ( where by definition the factor is 1 ) is an important area of research for understanding the formation of the solar wind .",
    "fip factors for the solar wind are determined from in situ particle measurements and believed to be robust .",
    "fip factors for the solar corona and transition region are inferred from spectroscopic observations and are sensitive to a number of uncertainties . here",
    "we will explore how uncertainties in the dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rate coefficients limit our ability to infer fip factors in the solar upper atmosphere .    of the many ionization and recombination rate coefficients which go into ionization balance calculations for solar and stellar coronae ( i.e. , electron - ionized plasmas ) ,",
    "the high temperature dr rate coefficients are believed to be the most uncertain @xcite .",
    "unlike most other atomic processes ( e.g. , ionization and excitation ) where the direct contribution dominates the process , for dr is solely a resonant process .",
    "these resonances are doubly - excited , intermediate states which are highly correlated which makes the calculations theoretically and computationally challenging .    especially important are the high temperature dr rate coefficients for ions with partially filled @xmath4-shells",
    ". the astrophysical implications of these uncertainties are poorly understood .",
    "investigating these implications is important because dr is the dominant electron - ion recombination process for most ions in cosmic plasmas .",
    "typically , inferences of the fip effect from the solar corona are made from spectra that exhibit lines from several charge states of the same element ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such cases any uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients and the ionization balance calculations essentially cancel out .",
    "this is because an error that might increase the fraction of ions in a particular charge state , does so at the expense of ionic fractions in neighboring charge states .",
    "if one observes a whole series of charge states to evaluate the fip effect ( e.g. , fe ix , x , xi , xii , xiii , xiv , xv , and xvi in the case of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these problems are to a large extent obviated .",
    "similar procedures are difficult to follow at solar transition region temperatures where fewer elements have substantial series of observable charge states .",
    "the situation is compounded by the temperature dependence of the emission measure , as discussed in   [ subsec : solardisk ] , and by the trend in solar physics instrumentation towards spectrometers with ever more limited bandpass while spatial and spectral resolution and sensitivity improve .",
    "for example , the spectrometers on the solar orbiting heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) such as the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) must scan their detectors across the bandpass to build up a full spectrum .",
    "this limits their utility in observing time varying plasmas .",
    "the extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer @xcite will use multilayer coated gratings , which will further restrict the bandpass .",
    "the proposed wavelength ranges , @xmath5 and @xmath6   will provide good coverage in strong lines of fe ix - xvi and , but are less satisfactory for ions of other elements .",
    "for these reasons accurate dr rate coefficients for the few lines that will be studied in current and future solar satellite missions have become more essential than ever .",
    "here we investigate the extent to which fip enhancement factors , inferred using individual line ratios , can be affected by uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients used in the data analysis .",
    "we hope to motivate further experimental and theoretical studies of dr .",
    "we begin by reviewing in ",
    "2 the status of the theoretical dr results currently used in ionization balance calculations .",
    "we focus primarily on the rate coefficients for dr onto the @xmath4-shell ions through , through , through , and and .",
    "lines from these ions are commonly observed from solar and stellar coronae . in   3",
    "we discuss how relative abundances are determined for solar and stellar upper atmospheres and the current observational status of relative abundance determinations .",
    "we describe in ",
    "4 the ionization balance calculations , how the calculations are sensitive to our estimated uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients , and present some implications .",
    "we conclude in   5 by making some specific recommendation for future directions in theoretical and experimental studies of dr .",
    "dr is a two - step process .",
    "it begins when a free electron collisionally excites an ion and is simultaneously captured ( i.e. , dielectronic capture ) .",
    "core excitations of the ion can be labeled @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the principal quantum number of the core electron , @xmath9 is its angular momentum , and @xmath10 the total angular momentum of the core electron . in general ,",
    "the most important dr channels are those via @xmath11 or 1 core excitations .",
    "the incident electron is captured into some @xmath12 rydberg level forming any one of an infinite number of intermediate doubly - excited states of the recombining ion .",
    "these states can either autoionize or radiatively stabilize , the latter of which completes the dr process .",
    "energy conservation requires @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the kinetic energy of the incident electron , @xmath15 the excitation energy of the core electron , and @xmath16 the binding energy released when the free electron is captured .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are quantized , making dr is a resonant process .",
    "the dr rate coefficient represents the convolution of these resonances with a maxwellian electron energy distribution .",
    "here we are interested in low - electron - density , zero - field dr rate coefficients .",
    "ionization balance calculations generally assume that electron densities are low enough that collisional ionization of the weakly bound electron captured in the dr process is unimportant .",
    "these calculations also assume that any external electric and magnetic fields are too weak to affect the dr rate coefficient , and that metastable populations in all ions are insignificant .",
    "reliable calculations of dr are extremely challenging theoretically and computationally .",
    "in contrast to most other atomic processes ( e.g. , ionization and excitation ) where the direct contribution dominates the process , dr is solely a resonant process .",
    "these resonances are doubly - excited , intermediate states which are highly correlated .",
    "these states greatly complicate calculations , since an accurate treatment of electron correlation is required @xcite .",
    "calculations also require accounting for an infinite number of states .",
    "this is clearly impossible using a finite basis expansion .",
    "approximations must be made to make the calculations tractable @xcite .",
    "many different theoretical techniques have been used to calculate dr rate coefficients for plasma modeling . in the past",
    ", semi - empirical expressions such as the @xcite formula along with modified versions by @xcite and @xcite were derived to calculate dr rate coefficients .",
    "more recently , a number of sophisticated theoretical approaches have been developed , among them configuration - averaging @xcite ; single - configuration @xmath17-coupling @xcite ; quantum defect @xcite ; intermediate - coupling @xcite ; nonrelativistic , multiconfiguration hartree - fock ( mchf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; semi - relativistic , multiconfiguration breit - pauli ( mcbp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; fully relativistic , multiconfiguration dirac - fock ( mcdf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and relativistic many - body perturbation theory ( rmbpt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) methods .",
    "other methods include the hebrew university lawrence livermore atomic code ( hullac ) which uses a relativistic , multiconfiguration , parametric potential method @xcite and @xmath18-matrix methods where radiative recombination ( rr ) and dr are treated in a unified manner in the close - coupling approximation @xcite . however , the result of all these different theoretical techniques and required approximations are dr rate coefficients which often differ by factors of @xmath19 to 4 or more @xcite .",
    "cosmic plasmas are most commonly modeled using the recommended dr rate coefficients of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "essentially none of these dr rate coefficients have been calculated using state - of - the - art techniques ( i.e. mchf , mcbp , mcdf , rmbpt , hullac , or @xmath18-matrix techniques which include the spin - orbit interaction ) .",
    "the vast majority of these have been calculated using single - configuration pure @xmath17-coupling , semi - empirical formulae , or isoelectronic interpolations .",
    "it is important to carry out calculations using techniques more sophisticated than @xmath17-coupling because @xmath17-coupling calculations are known not to include all possible autoionization levels contributing to the dr process , due to not including the spin - orbit interaction . as a result ,",
    "such calculations provide only a lower limit for the dr rate coefficient @xcite .",
    "for example , for lithiumlike ions , griffin et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and @xcite discussed how @xmath17-coupling accounts for only two - thirds of all possible @xmath20 recombining channels .",
    "intermediate coupling calculations yield a dr rate coefficient for lithiumlike c  iv which is 50% larger than the @xmath17-coupling result .",
    "recent ion storage ring measurements and relativistic many - body perturbation calculations have verified the importance of these @xmath17-forbidden autoionizing resonances @xcite . as for the various semi - empirical formulae",
    ", @xcite showed that a priori it is not possible to know which of the semi - empirical formulae will yield a result close to the true dr rate coefficient and which will be off by a factor of 2 .    due to the complexity of the theoretical descriptions for the dr process ,",
    "it is almost impossible to say _ a priori _ which approximations in the calculations are justified and which are not .",
    "laboratory measurements are needed to ensure that even state - of - the - art techniques produce reliable results .",
    "for example , initial mcbp results were a factor of @xmath21 larger than ion storage ring measurements @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy was later resolved @xcite ; but without laboratory measurements , the error in the theory would probably have gone undiscovered for many years .",
    "a related difficulty is that , for many of the ions and dr resonances important in electron - ionized cosmic plasmas , there are very few experimental techniques capable of carrying out measurements at the accuracy needed to provide benchmarks useful for the theorists .",
    "tokamak and theta pinch measurements suffer from factor of 2 uncertainties @xcite .",
    "crossed electron - ion beams techniques @xcite have been limited in the energy range accessible as well as by low signal rates .",
    "single - pass , merged electron - ion beam techniques @xcite can cover a wider energy range but also have low signal rates . due to a combination of poor statistics and poorly controlled external electric and magnetic fields , it is difficult to use most of these crossed- and merged - beams measurements to benchmark zero - field dr calculations . using either technique",
    "it is also difficult to determine the ion beam metastable population .",
    "hence these techniques can not be used to carry out absolute measurements for many ions with partially filled shells @xcite .",
    "the two state - of - the - art experimental techniques for studying dr are electron beam ion traps ( ebits ) and heavy - ion storage rings with a merged electron - ion beam interaction region .",
    "both techniques store the ions long enough for all metastable states to decay radiatively to the ground state .",
    "storage ring techniques measure absolute dr resonance strengths .",
    "ebits produce relative resonance strength measurements which can then be normalized to rr or electron impact excitation theory .    until recently ebit measurements were essentially limited to studying only closed shell systems @xcite .",
    "this has changed with the recent studies of dr onto @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "ebits , however , are still not capable of reliably studying dr for collision energies @xmath23  ev @xcite .",
    "these are the dominant dr channels for most ions of second and third row elements , especially for ions with partially filled shells .",
    "work is underway to overcome this limitation .",
    "the majority of the storage ring measurements for astrophysically important ions have been carried out using tsr and cryring @xcite .",
    "measurements of dr resonance strengths and energies have been reported using tsr from 0 to @xmath24  ev @xcite and using cryring from 0 to @xmath25  ev @xcite .",
    "storage rings are the optimal technique for studying dr resonances at energies not accessible to ebits .",
    "this makes storage rings particularly well suited for studying dr for ions of second and third row elements .",
    "the external fields in the merged beams section are also extremely well controlled which allows reliable , essentially zero - field dr measurements to be carried out @xcite . one limitation , though , is that ions with a charge - to - mass ratios @xmath26 can not be accelerated in cryring and tsr to a velocity where electron capture from the rest gas in the ring becomes negligible .",
    "the resulting poor signal - to - noise ratio prevents measurements of dr for such ions @xcite .    to date ,",
    "ebit and storage ring dr measurements have been limited in the isoelectronic sequences studied and the energy ranges covered .",
    "few data sets exist which are comprehensive enough to benchmark high temperature dr theory . and for those ions studied over a wide enough energy range , the benchmarked theory has not then been used to calculate the dr rate coefficients for all astrophysically important ions isoelectronic to the measured ion . as a result ,",
    "only a very small fraction of the dr rate coefficients used for modeling electron - ionized cosmic plasmas have come from benchmarked state - of - the - art theory .",
    "here we are interested in how uncertainties in the published dr rate coefficients affect the ionization balance calculations used to analyze solar and stellar spectra .",
    "the ions of interest are listed in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "however , the calculated abundance for a given ion is affected by the atomic rate coefficients for the ions one lower and higher in charge state ( and less so by ions two or more lower and higher ) . to account for this",
    ", we extend the list of ions of interest by one charge state on both the low and high end for each element considered .",
    "below we review and estimate uncertainties in the published high temperature rate coefficients for dr onto @xmath22 , @xmath22 , @xmath22 , and @xmath22 .    in the absence of measurements , the best way to estimate the uncertainty in the theoretical dr rate coefficients is to compare calculations along an isoelectronic sequence .",
    "this yields a conservative estimate .",
    "@xcite showed that published rate coefficients do not necessarily give reliable upper and lower limits for the range in which the true dr rate coefficient lies .",
    "the true dr rate coefficient may lie outside of these limits .",
    "hence our approach here may , in fact , underestimate the uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients    we compare the range of calculated dr rate coefficients to the recommended dr rate coefficients from @xcite in order to estimate the uncertainties in the `` state - of - the - art '' for ionization balance calculations . their dr rate coefficients are meant for use at temperatures between @xmath27 and @xmath28  k. wherever possible we also use laboratory measurements to benchmark theory . because experimental data often do not exist for the ions we are interested",
    ", we take into account measurements carried out on those isoelectronic ions which are closest in atomic number to the ions of interest .",
    "we also only take into account measurements of those resonances which are relevant to the dr rate coefficients of interest here . in our discussion below",

    "it is usual to include a factor of 1/2 to account for photons emitted towards the solar disk and absorbed by the photosphere . at low densities ( i.e. , in coronal plasma ) , we can write @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the total excitation rate coefficient of the excited level j by electron collisions and we have assumed the branching ratio for the @xmath69 radiative transition to be 1 . for the transitions of interest in the solar fip diagnostics under consideration here ( i.e. @xmath70 transitions in @xmath4-shell ions ) , excitation rate coefficients due to other processes",
    "are negligible compared to those from electron impact excitation . defining @xmath71 and changing the integration variable from volume to temperature gives @xmath72 where parameters not dependent on the electron temperature have been taken outside the integral .",
    "the quantity @xmath73 is the differential emission measure ( dem , also sometimes defined as @xmath74 ) .",
    "the usual procedure in determining the dem is to assume some functional form ( usually @xmath75 ) , evaluate @xmath18 for all lines , compare these values with observations and iterate on the dem distribution until satisfactory agreement is obtained .",
    "this can be done for all the lines of one particular element ( usually fe ) .",
    "then lines from other elements can be analyzed the same way to determine relative element abundances . however in this procedure the role of uncertainties in particular atomic rate coefficients becomes obscured by the quantity of data and number of iterations required .",
    "a second technique for determining relative abundances is to use a line from an ion of a specific element and another line from an ion of a different element .",
    "this is the technique which will most likely be used to infer relative abundances from future solar satellite missions .",
    "the lines are chosen so that the respective values of @xmath76 , to a first approximation , have similar dependences on temperature , differing only by a multiplicative constant .",
    "using equation  [ eq : r ] to take the ratio of the two lines , it is easy to show that the ratio of the two integrals reduces to this constant , which is determined from atomic parameters , times the relative abundances . in this approximation , the shape of the dem has no affect on the results .",
    "this technique has the advantage of allowing one to study how uncertainties in atomic physics affect the inferred relative abundances .",
    "the first systematic analysis of coronal abundances over a wide temperature region using high quality spectral data was probably that of @xcite who used a variant of the first dem method described above .",
    "they analyzed the full - disk solar corona spectrum of @xcite and covered a range of @xmath77 .",
    "they found an abundance pattern consistent with that of the slow speed solar wind , at least for solar coronal plasma with an electron temperature @xmath78 ( i.e. @xmath79  k ) .",
    "more recent studies with lines from ions formed at similar high temperatures corroborate this result @xcite .",
    "but in what was a surprise at the time , they found essentially no fip enhancement in transition region plasma at @xmath80 .",
    "a similar result was found earlier by @xcite , who used data from the skylab s-055 euv spectroheliometer .",
    "interpreting spectra from these cooler temperatures poses a number of problems .",
    "this may be in part due to complications in the solar physics at these temperatures @xcite , or due to problems in the interpretation of the data . at transition region temperatures , the solar emission measure @xmath81 is an increasing function of @xmath82 .",
    "the `` canonical '' quiet sun behaviour is @xmath83 @xcite , though in certain solar features power laws of @xmath84 or higher may be appropriate @xcite .",
    "this is quite different from the situation at @xmath85 where in the quiet sun the emission measure is in general much less steep , and may even be flat in certain temperature regimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one consequence of the @xmath86 temperature dependence is that in observations of ions formed at @xmath87 , where the emission measure is not significantly temperature dependent , the detected line emission comes primarily from regions near the temperatures of peak fractional abundance for the observed ions .",
    "however , this is not the case for ions with formation temperatures of @xmath80 . for these ions ,",
    "the steeply rising @xmath86 skews the temperature range over which emission from the ions is sampled to temperatures well above those where the ions peak in fractional abundance . under these conditions uncertainties in the atomic data used to calculate the ionization balance",
    "can significantly affect the inferred properties of the observed plasma .",
    "in addition , at temperatures significantly above or below those where an ion is formed in ionization equilibrium , we find that the fractional ion abundances calculated by balancing the electron - ion ionization and recombination rate coefficients are extremely sensitive to errors in the atomic data .",
    "much of the work prior to that of @xcite had clearly observed fip effects at @xmath80 , principally using the / and / intensity ratios in the second , simpler method outlined in ",
    "[ subsec : determining ] for determining relative abundances @xcite .",
    "one reason for the apparent disagreement between these studies and that of @xcite is probably that while laming et al .  studied a full disk integrated spectrum ,",
    "the prior work had concentrated on discrete solar features observed by the skylab so-82a spectroheliograph .",
    "specifically , the skylab investigations had concerned a coronal polar plume @xcite , an impulsive flare @xcite , an open field active region @xcite , or a variety of such features @xcite .",
    "interestingly the study of a coronal hole using a / line ratio @xcite yielded an apparent fip enhancement of about 2 - 2.5 at @xmath88 .",
    "this is slightly higher than the findings of @xcite for the full disk sun in this lower temperature range .",
    "however , given the estimated uncertainties of 50% in the @xcite and @xcite in this temperature range , and the different methods of analysis , there is a suggestion that these results are in agreement .",
    "the fip enhancements of @xcite are also similar to or slightly higher than those observed in the fast speed solar wind , which is believed to emanate from coronal holes . the results of @xcite and @xcite support the hypothesis that the fip factor decreases as one moves inward from the solar corona to the transition region .",
    "a considerable amount of attention has been given to the open field active region reported by @xcite and the coronal polar plume reported by @xcite .",
    "this is due to the observed fip enhancements being greater than an order of magnitude . _",
    "soho _ observations of open field active regions using cds have found results @xcite similar to those of the active region of @xcite .",
    "_ soho _ observations have also been carried out of coronal polar plumes , principally using sumer . @xcite",
    "made observations of the si / ne abundance ratio ( as a proxy for the fip effect ) and found a fip enhancement of only a factor of 2 .",
    "other sumer observers find similar results @xcite .",
    "so far , it has not been possible to reproduce the polar plume results of @xcite .",
    "the emission measure in the open field active region analyzed by @xcite is relatively flat with temperature and the inferred fip enhancements of these features are believed to be reliable .",
    "however , the emission measure plotted by @xcite for their observed coronal polar plume rises very steeply with temperature .",
    "although the and ionization fractions match each other very well near their temperature of peak formation , at higher temperatures the fraction becomes larger than that for .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ mgne ] where the relative intensities are plotted for the 1190.09 and 558.59   lines , using the ionization balance of @xcite .",
    "the excitation rate coefficients are taken to vary as @xmath89 , where @xmath15 is the excitation potential and @xmath82 is the electron temperature . under conditions where the temperature structure of the plasma weights the emission from these lines so that the temperature region greater than @xmath90 is dominant , apparent abundance enhancements of mg over ne may result simply due to the relative ionization fractions .",
    "realistic calculations by @xcite for the emission measure distributions found by @xcite suggest that an extra factor of 2 - 3 in the intensity ratio , on top of the usual fip effect , could result from this effect .",
    "thus if the true fip effect is a factor of 2 - 4 , an apparent abundance enhancement of an order of magnitude or more could result .",
    "all observations of stellar coronae are necessarily disk integrated .",
    "in general in spectra of stellar coronae , individual line ratios for fip effect diagnostics are not as readily available as they are in solar spectra .",
    "most abundance results have been derived using these spectra from emission measure plots , and related techniques , where the effect of uncertainties in dr is much less transparent .",
    "however two papers that do use specific line ratios are @xcite on procyon and @xcite on @xmath91 cen .",
    "these sources are perhaps the two best observed stellar coronae with the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( _ euve _ ) .    in general , analyses on _ euve",
    "_ spectra of solar - like stars have found coronal abundance anomalies similar to the solar fip effect .",
    "only procyon appears to have a photospheric abundance corona .",
    "coronal abundances in active binary stars do not show such effects , but hint at a trend of decreasing coronal metallicity with increasing activity . these and other results prior to the launch of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites are reviewed by @xcite . with the advent of high resolution stellar x - ray spectroscopy with",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , the field of stellar coronae and their abundances is set to become a rich area of research .",
    "already new results have raised the possibility of yet more varied coronal abundance patterns , e.g. , the inverse fip effect @xcite or enhanced ne and ar @xcite in the coronae of hr 1099 .",
    "our work focuses on studying particular line ratios because of their importance for determining relative abundance ratios using data collected from past , current , and future solar satellite missions .",
    "these line ratios also offer a relatively transparent insight into the effect of uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients on abundance measurements . _",
    "soho _ studies have been carried out using / , / , / , / , / , and / line ratios .",
    "wavelengths for the observed lines are given in detail in table 3 .",
    "an additional abundance ratio that is of interest is / , derived from the si x 258.40 and 261.27   lines and s x transitions at 259.50 and 264.24  which has been used in _",
    "euve _ abundance studies on the coronae of @xmath91 centauri @xcite .",
    "we consider all of the 7 above listed line ratios in our discussion below .",
    "the ionization fraction @xmath92 of the ion with charge @xmath61 is given by @xmath93 \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are the rate coefficients for electron impact ionization , rr , and dr respectively , out of the charge state @xmath61 .",
    "for the coronal plasmas under consideration here three - body recombination can be safely neglected . in ionization equilibrium ,",
    "@xmath97 which gives @xmath98 independent linear equations for the @xmath99 charge states .",
    "the constraint that all charge state fractions must add up to unity supplies the final equation , allowing us to solve the @xmath99 linear equations by lu decomposition ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) of the matrix formed by the right hand side of equation  [ eqn1 ] .",
    "this set of linear equations is solved repeatedly with rate coefficients appropriate to different electron temperatures to find the temperature dependence of the different charge state fractions .",
    "initially the ionization , rr adn dr rate coefficients are taken from the same sources as used by @xcite .      using equation  [ eq : r ] , the relative abundances for two elements , a1 and a2 is given by @xmath100 this equation is first evaluated with ionization balance calculations which use the unscaled dr rate coefficients of @xcite .",
    "to investigate the effects that the various sets of dr rate coefficients have on the inferred value of @xmath101 , we define the quantity @xmath102 where the subscripts old and new refer , respectively , to ionization balance calculations carried out using the unscaled and scaled dr rate coefficients of @xcite . multiplying the right - hand - side of equation  [ eq : na1vna2 ] by @xmath103 yields the new inferred relative abundances .",
    "we note that a decrease(increase ) in the calculated value of @xmath103 corresponds to a decrease(increase ) in the inferred fip enhancement for a given value of @xmath104 .",
    "for our calculations of @xmath103 we made a number of simplifying assumptions . for the pairs of lines we are concerned with here , to a first approximation the values of @xmath105 have the same temperature dependence .",
    "to simplify the calculations we have assumed a flat dem ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "we further simplify the calculations by neglecting the temperature dependence of @xmath68 , setting it equal to 1 for each ion . in this way we are able to focus specifically on how the uncertainty in the dr rate coefficients affects @xmath103 .",
    "we then calculated @xmath103 for all 1728 sets of dr rate coefficients .",
    "the calculations were carried out over the temperature range @xmath107 from @xmath108 .",
    "this covers the temperature range over which the ions of interest form . for brevity , we have listed in table  [ tab : srange ] only the range of @xmath103 values for all 1728 variations .",
    "clearly the uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients can have a dramatic affect on any inferred fip enhancement factors .",
    "we note that table  [ tab : srange ] does not display the correlations between the values of @xmath103 for different line ratios for each set of dr variations .",
    "we have reduced the set of dr variations using our current hypothesis for the structure of the fip effect . and are transition region temperature ions which have been observed by @xcite from close to the solar limb out into the corona ( where these ions are observed far away in temperature from where they peak in abundance ) .",
    "the inferred fip effect is expected to be @xmath109 in the coronal observations and decrease as one moves to transition region temperatures closer to the solar limb .",
    "this expected behavior for the mg / ne abundance ration can be seen in table  [ tab : fip ] which is reproduced here from @xcite .",
    "line emission from and is always dominated by coronal temperature plasmas and the / ratio is expected to display a fip factor of 4 at all positions listed in table  [ tab : fip ] .",
    "@xcite measured a fip factor of @xmath110 . for our selection criteria , we take only those dr variations for which the fip effect inferred using / line ratio varies by less than @xmath111 and which also increase the fip effect inferred using /.",
    "the 25% is based on the estimated errors in the measured line ratios .",
    "we found 548 sets which met these constraints .",
    "this set was reduced to 274 by taking into account the fact that changes in the dr rate coefficient onto neonlike had essentially no affect on the results .",
    "we have listed in table  [ tab : srange ] the range of @xmath103 for this reduced set of variations .",
    "clearly , even in this reduced set the uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients can still have a dramatic affect on many inferred fip enhancement factors .      at heights of 50 arcsec or more from the solar limb ,",
    "the corona becomes essentially isothermal .",
    "as one away from the solar limb , the amount of cooler transition region plasma decreases quickly with height , while the hotter coronal gas diminishes much less rapidly , and quickly becomes the dominant component .",
    "a striking illustration of this in the case of a solar equatorial streamer is given in @xcite . in figure 3 of their paper",
    "they plot the variation of intensity with distance from the solar limb for various transitions from ions of - .",
    "all line intensities @xmath112 show the same slope @xmath113 and hence the same temperature , which from the slope evaluates to about @xmath114 k. feldman et al .",
    "plot in their figure 4 the loci of emission measures determined from these si ions .",
    "possible calibration uncertainties exist for the results as it is at the extreme short wavelength end of the sumer second order bandpass @xcite . ignoring the loci ,",
    "the temperature determined from the intersection of the remaining emission measure loci is @xmath115 .",
    "this is similar to that determined from the height dependence of the emission in the various lines , assumed to fall off according to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "@xcite used the older ionization balance of @xcite . in order to assess the impact of our suggested changes to dielectronic recombination rate coefficients , we have remeasured the line intensities and replotted the emission measure determined using the ionization balance of @xcite . these results are shown in figure [ fig_si0 ] . comparing with figure 4 of @xcite",
    "we can see that the temperature at which the various curves intersect is now given by @xmath116 .",
    "we have investigated the effect of varying the dr rate coefficients in the si ionization balance calculations .",
    "we have looked at variations of the rate coefficients in a `` trial and error '' fashion .",
    "nine plausible sets of variations are given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "others exist among our 1728 attempts , but these nine serve to illustrate one effect we are interested in . in figure [ fig_si1](a )",
    "we replot the temperature region @xmath117 from the previous plot .",
    "figures  [ fig_si1](b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) give , respectively , the plots corresponding to variations 4 , 2 , and 3 of the @xcite dr rate coefficients . variations 4 , 5 , 7 , and 9 are very similar as are variations 1 , 2 , 6 and 8 .",
    "the curves due to 499.41   have been omitted from these plots due to suspicions about the instrument calibration . in all panels",
    "the degree of overlap between the various intersections of the emission measure loci has improved .",
    "the improvement is best for variation 3 , followed by variation 2 .",
    "variation 4 is the least successful .",
    "thus the important conclusion that we are observing an isothermal plasma is , if anything , strengthened by our considerations of these plausible variations in the dr rate coefficients .",
    "we have described on the basis of atomic physics theory what uncertainties may be present in the dr rate coefficients commonly used in ionization balance calculations . of course",
    "this situation will only be definitely improved by further calculations and experiments , but given the number of individual rate coefficients required for astrophysical modeling purposes , this is an enormous amount of work . to help prioritize the needed atomic data , and to provide further motivation ,",
    "we have investigated how the uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients translate into uncertainties in inferred fip factors .",
    "we find that , depending on the specific line ratio , inferred fip factors can be a factor of 5 smaller or 1.6 times larger that the fip factor inferred using the unscaled dr rate coefficients of @xcite .",
    "taking the unconstrained data in table  [ tab : srange ] and using the ratio of the maximum over minimum value of @xmath103 for each line ratio , we can prioritize the need for dr measurements and calculations of the various isoelectronic sequences studied here . listing the various line ratios in decreasing order of @xmath118 yields : / , / , / , / , / , / , and /.",
    "based on the order and frequency with which the different isoelectronic sequences occur in this list , we prioritize our list of needed rate coefficients for dr onto specific isoelectronic sequences , in decreasing order of importance , as follows : o - like , c - like , be - like , n - like , b - like . to this we append f - like , li - like , he - like , and ne - like based on the range of the dr scale factors given in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "we have arrived at our list through admittedly subjective means , but we believe that in this case the ends justify the means . faced with the current degree of uncertainty in the dielectronic recombination rate coefficients relevant to astrophysical plasmas , the number of required calculations and measurements is a daunting task .",
    "our aim in this work has been to prioritize this work , and to point out those ions where the uncertainties in the dr rate coefficients has the most impact on the analysis of astrophysical uv and x - ray spectra .",
