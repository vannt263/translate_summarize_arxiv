    "comparison of classical and quantum dynamics is not only of interest at a fundamental level but is also of particular conceptual and computational value in applications where both classical and quantum phenomena play equally important roles ( eg . statistical mechanics , quantum chemistry , molecular dynamics etc ) .",
    "however , such comparison can be hindered by the clear formal differences between classical mechanics and the standard ` operator ' formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "a common basis for comparing quantum mechanics and classical mechanics was provided by the introduction of the wigner distribution function on phase space  @xcite .",
    "it brought to quantum mechanics not only the advantages of c - number only equations but also the appeal of classical concepts that accompany a phase space description .",
    "thus , for example , has the framework of quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) emerged from zeroth , first and second momentum moments of the wigner distribution and been applied to semi - conductor device modelling  @xcite . in such approaches , separable quantum internal energy terms appear alongside classical thermal pressure and scattering terms .",
    "the explicit appearance of an internal energy ( or stress ) is a result of the projection from the phase space representation to the configuration space representation .",
    "this point was made for pure states in quantum mechanics by takabayasi  @xcite and , more recently , has been demonstrated by muga et al .",
    "@xcite for classical mechanics and for pure and mixed states in quantum mechanics .",
    "as noted in  @xcite and exemplified in  @xcite , the quantum contribution can be different in different formalisms and/or approximations .",
    "ferry and zhou",
    "@xcite draw attention to the lack of consensus as to the form of the correction potential to be included in the qhd equations used for semi - conductor device modelling .",
    "they point out that both the bohm potential and the wigner potential have appeared both separately and together in various formulations of qhd .",
    "( see references in  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite , ferry and zhou find a correction term ( hereafter referred to as the ferry - zhou potential ) which is the difference between the bohm potential and the wigner potential as defined in  @xcite .",
    "implicit in this finding is the observation that the bohm ( quantum ) potential is expressible as the sum of two other potentials , at least for a pure quantum state .",
    "we make the further observation that little if any attention has been given to the appearance of a quantum potential in the momentum space representation .",
    "the last two observations motivate the present investigation of the composition and role of the ( bohm ) quantum potential in quantum mechanics at a more fundamental level .",
    "however , rather than starting from a phase space formulation of quantum mechanics , we start from the the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics on configuration space .",
    "this interpretation offers an alternative basis for direct comparison of quantum and classical dynamics through the hamilton - jacobi formalism . in the causal interpretation , the quantum potential , in addition to the external potential ,",
    "guides the trajectory of the ` quantum particle '  @xcite . the functional form and the effects of the quantum potential in this interpretation",
    "have been extensively studied for a wide variety of specific cases  @xcite and in  @xcite .    in this paper , we give equal attention to the expression of the causal interpretation and the appearance of the quantum potential not only in the configuration space representation but also in the momentum space representation . rather than using a phase space projection to obtain the momentum representation , we use the momentum space representation of the position and momentum operators to obtain the momentum space representation of the quantum hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "a comparison of the causal interpretation in its respective configuration space and momentum space representations provides insight into the classical symplectic symmetry breaking role of the quantum potential .",
    "if the quantum potential reflects the quantum aspects of a system , it should be possible to identify such aspects within the quantum potential . the quantum stress ( an energy per unit volume in configuration space ) identified by takabayasi",
    "@xcite , is a measure of momentum dispersion in configuration space and is proportional to the wigner potential mentioned above . in this paper , we show how in configuration space the balance of the momentum dispersion energy in the bohm quantum potential is formed by the quantum localisation energy which is the ferry - zhou potential also identified above .",
    "the latter is proportional to the curvature of the probability density ; hence its description as a localisation energy .",
    "we also establish the corresponding relationship between the spatial dispersion energy and momentum localisation energy in the momentum space representation .",
    "thus , we find that the balance between localisation and dispersion energies suggests a link between the quantum potential and the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "qpcuas ] , the appearance of the quantum potential in the standard configuration space representation of the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics is briefly reviewed . in section  [ sec : gender ] , the derivation of the quantum potential is generalised in configuration and momentum space and its emergence from the actions of the respective kinetic and potential energy operators is demonstrated . in section  [ sec : symplc ] , the symplectic structure of the causal interpretation is investigated by expressing its equations in hamiltonian form .",
    "the classical symplectic symmetry breaking property of the quantum potential is demonstrated . in section  [ sec : disploc ] , the quantum potential is expressed as the sum of dispersion and localisation energies and a connection with the heisenberg uncertainty principle is suggested . in section  [ sec : expls ] , we examine the role and composition of the quantum potential for a particle in a linear potential and for the ground state and second excited state of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the quantum potential emerges from bohm s causal interpretation  @xcite of quantum mechanics on configuration space , when the substitution @xmath0 is made in the schrdinger equation : @xmath1 and the real and imaginary parts are separated yielding the equations : @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 and the particle is assumed to have a definite , but unknown , position with a momentum given by @xmath5 the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation  ( [ eq : hj ] ) contains the extra ` quantum potential ' term , @xmath6 , which is dependent upon the magnitude of the wavefunction but not upon its phase .",
    "newton s second law is modified by the ` quantum force ' term and becomes @xmath7 the kinematic relation @xmath8 derived from the identification of the current density @xmath9 in equation  ( [ eq : con ] ) , allows trajectories to be determined from the integral curves of  ( [ eq : mom ] ) .",
    "since s is determined by  ( [ eq : schro ] ) , both the trajectory of an individual particle and the evolution of its dynamical variables are determined by the time development of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in bohm s approach , dynamical behaviour may be expressed through , but not derived from , the familiar apparatus of classical mechanics .",
    "the conservation equation  ( [ eq : con ] ) ensures that if the density of an ensemble of such trajectories is , at any time , proportional to @xmath11 , then it was and will be so for all time .",
    "it should be emphasised that the bohm formulation of quantum mechanics is an exact expression of the schrdinger equation and not a wkb approximation as is sometimes suggested .",
    "the motion of a system may be obtained either by integrating  ( [ eq : vel ] ) , or in principle , by integrating the modified newton s equation  ( [ eq : for ] ) with the initial condition satisfying equation  ( [ eq : mom ] ) . however , unlike the external potential , the quantum potential is not a pre - assigned function of the system co - ordinates and can only be derived from the the wavefunction .",
    "it is therefore essentially quantum in nature .",
    "we generalise the above derivation of the quantum potential by first writing the schrdinger equation in the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are kinetic and potential energy functions of the momentum and position operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the substitution @xmath0 is made recognising that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are functions of @xmath19 ( in the configuration space representation ) or of @xmath20 ( in the momentum space representation ) .    applying this ansatz in configuration space , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the schrdinger equation become : @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspondingly , in momentum space , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the real and imaginary parts of the schrdinger equation are : @xmath27 and @xmath28 the symmetry between these two representations of the schrdinger equation is clear . in the remaining part of this section",
    "we show how both classical - like and quantum terms emerge from equations  ( [ eq : hjx ] ) and  ( [ eq : hjp ] ) and how the quantum terms constitute the quantum potential .",
    "attention is first given to the configuration space representation .",
    "expanding exponentials , we write the ` kinetic ' term in  ( [ eq : hjx ] ) as : @xmath29 if @xmath30 is a general but regular function of @xmath31 , it may be expanded as a power series in @xmath22 .",
    "the ` kinetic ' term may then be separated into the sum of two parts : @xmath32 ( see appendix . ) @xmath33 is an expansion in even positive powers of @xmath34 and so tends to zero as @xmath34 tends to zero . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath35 is independent of @xmath34 and identifies @xmath36 .",
    "the same line of argument allows the ` potential ' term of the hamilton - jacobi equation  ( [ eq : hjp ] ) to be separated into : @xmath37 @xmath38 is in general an expansion in even positive powers of @xmath34 . on the otherhand",
    ", @xmath39 is independent of @xmath34 and identifies @xmath40 .    in the configuration representation , it is the simple quadratic monomial form of the kinetic energy operator : @xmath41 that leads to the simple one term expression : @xmath42 known as the quantum potential , while @xmath43 has the same form as the classical kinetic energy .    in the momentum representation ,",
    "the quantum potential does not , in general , have the simple one term form of the usual configuration space representation .",
    "( see appendix ) .",
    "the free particle aside , there are other exceptions to this rule . for the linear potential @xmath44",
    ", there is no quantum potential in the momentum representation . for the harmonic oscillator potential @xmath45",
    ", the quantum potential has the simple form : @xmath46 while @xmath47 has the same form as the classical potential energy .",
    "these equations have the same form as  ( [ eq : tqxx ] ) and  ( [ eq : tcxx ] ) , being likewise generated by a quadratic monomial form .",
    "potentials , @xmath48 , of higher polynomial order generate a series of energy terms contributing to the total quantum potential in the momentum representation .",
    "these include the sum of products of derivatives of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with respect to @xmath20 ; all terms having even powers of @xmath49 .",
    "for example , in the monomial case of @xmath50 , the quantum potential in the momentum representation is : @xmath51 and the external potential is : @xmath52 the composition of the quantum potential in the momentum representation is therefore , in general , much harder to evaluate and interpret than in the configuration space representation .",
    "we build upon the previous section by expressing the dynamic  ( [ eq : for ] ) and kinematic  ( [ eq : vel ] ) relations of the causal interpretation in hamiltonian form using an effective hamiltonian .    from equations  ( [ eq : hjx ] ) ,  ( [ eq : sumt ] ) and  ( [ eq : tc ] ) of the configuration space representation , the causal trajectory moves under the influence of the effective hamiltonian @xmath53 where the identification @xmath36 is understood .",
    "the kinematic and dynamic equations of motion for the trajectory emerge directly from hamilton s equations : @xmath54_{p=\\nabla_{x}s } = \\left[\\frac{\\partial { t(p)}}{\\partial p}\\right]_{p=\\nabla_{x}s } \\label{eq : xdotx}\\ ] ] and @xmath55    similarly , from equations  ( [ eq : hjp ] ) ,  ( [ eq : sumv ] ) and  ( [ eq : vc ] ) of the momentum space representation , the causal trajectory moves under the influence of the effective hamiltonian @xmath56 where the identification @xmath40 is understood . using a legendre transformation , the hamiltonian form of the kinematic ( [ eq : xdotx ] ) and dynamic  ( [ eq : pdotx ] ) equations of motion in configuration space may be converted to momentum space but applied to the effective hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hp ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath57_{x=-\\nabla_{p}s } = -\\left[\\frac{\\partial { v(x)}}{\\partial x}\\right]_{x=-\\nabla_{p}s } \\label{eq : pdotp}\\ ] ] and @xmath58    comparison between equations  ( [ eq : xdotx ] ) and  ( [ eq : xdotp ] ) and between equations  ( [ eq : pdotp ] ) and  ( [ eq : pdotx ] ) shows how the precise symplectic symmetry of classical mechanics is broken by the quantum potential terms in momentum and configuration space respectively .",
    "thus , in general , the trajectory @xmath59 through configuration space is not the same as the trajectory @xmath60 in momentum space . @xmath61 and @xmath62 are , in general , correspondingly different .",
    "these differences seem to reflect the complementary dispersions of position and momentum in quantum mechanics and suggest a connection between the breaking of symplectic symmetry by the quantum potential and the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "insofar as the quantum potential is a uniquely quantum energy , it is natural to enquire of the source of that energy and to try to identify its composition .",
    "a single quantum system has kinetic energy and potential energy .",
    "however , unlike single classical systems , it also has intrinsic internal energies respectively associated with spatial localisation and momentum dispersion .",
    "these quantum features , whose complementary relationship is expressed through the heisenberg uncertainty relation , form the mechanism by which a quantum system maintains its non - local ( ie non - point like ) identity in phase space . in the following , we show how , in the configuration space representation , the quantum potential can expressed as the sum of localisation and dispersion energies .",
    "attention is then given to the same relationship in the momentum space representation .      in order to develop the link between the quantum potential and localisation and dispersion energies , we first write the quantum potential in configuration space as the sum of two terms : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 the meaning of the suffices is explained below .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , ferry and zhou  @xcite identify @xmath66 as the wigner potential whilst themselves introducing @xmath67 ( which we call the ferry - zhou potential ) as the quantum correction potential in their representation of the qhd equations for semi - conductor modelling . expressing the quantum potential in the form of  ( [ eq : disp1 ] ) also allows us to make an important connection with the work of takabayasi  @xcite on the quantum mechanics of pure states on phase space .",
    "takabayasi  @xcite determines conditions on all distribution moments of the wigner density @xmath68 in phase space which guarantee its representing a pure state .",
    "these conditions are determined by projections onto configuration space and onto momentum space . here",
    "we present the conditions on the second moments of the distribution @xmath68 with respect to momentum which apply for the projection onto a one - dimensional configuration space .",
    "( the generalisation to all space dimensions is given in  @xcite ) .",
    "the probability density and the first and second moments of the wigner density are given by : @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 defining the mean moments as @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the lowest order condition on the moments is the dispersion relation : @xmath74 thus , @xmath66 in  ( [ eq : disp1a ] ) is identified as the momentum dispersion energy . since the wigner density can be negative for quantum systems , the momentum dispersion can also be negative .",
    "in classical ensembles , the momentum dispersion is never negative because the liouville density in phase space is never negative .",
    "@xmath67 , in  ( [ eq : disp1b ] ) , is a measure of the local curvature of the probability density @xmath75 and we call it the localisation energy for the following reason : it contributes positively to the quantum potential in regions of negative curvature ( eg near maxima ) and contributes negatively in regions of positive curvature ( eg near minima ) which correspond to high spatial dispersion .",
    "the latter is in contrast to the positive contribution to the quantum potential caused by a high momentum dispersion .",
    "the quantum potential in configuration space is therefore the balance between the energies of spatial and momentum dispersion in quantum systems .",
    "this balance suggests a link between the quantum potential and heisenberg s position - momentum uncertainty principle .",
    "it is important to realise that the above process of projection from phase space onto configuration space can be applied to a classical ensemble of particles each subject to the corresponding classical hamiltonian .",
    "muga et al .",
    "@xcite show how this leads to an internal potential in configuration space which appears , in addition to the external potential , in the classical hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "as in the quantum case , the internal potential will not vanish unless the momentum dispersion energy vanishes .",
    "however , we note here that the quantum ( internal ) potential is distinguished ( at least for a pure state ) by being a function of the probability density in @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the momentum dispersion energy is dependent upon the density distribution in @xmath19 ; a feature certainly absent from the corresponding classical ensemble of non - interacting particles .",
    "this inter - dependence of the momentum and configuration space distributions clarifies the link between the quantum potential and the heisenberg uncertainty principle .    in the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the quantum system is represented by an ensemble of particle trajectories ( a classical notion ) whose density in configuration space is at all times proportional @xmath76 .",
    "each trajectory is not only subject to the external potential , @xmath48 , but also to the ` internal ' quantum potential , @xmath33 , which , being composed of the internal energies @xmath77 and @xmath78 , reflects the internal structure of the extended quantum system .",
    "such ` internal ' energies are absent from classical particles , because they are points having no inner structure .",
    "it is only through ensembles of classical particle trajectories that a representation of the quantum system can be obtained .",
    "we can propose an alternative interpretation that avoids reference to classical particles and treats the quantum system as an extended continuum .",
    "in such a model , the quantum potential in @xmath79 at @xmath19 applies to the fraction @xmath80 of the quantum system rather than to the whole system represented as a classical particle at @xmath19 with the appropriate probability weighting .",
    "the internal energy per unit volume at @xmath19 is therefore @xmath81 and may be described as the internal ` quantum stress ' or quantum potential density @xmath82 . by multiplying  ( [ eq : disp1 ] ) throughout by @xmath83 the quantum potential density , @xmath82 ,",
    "may be expressed as the sum of momentum dispersion and the spatial localisation energy densities : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 the energy densities , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , themselves provide information on the internal structure of the quantum system and result from the projection of wigner phase space representation of the quantum system onto configuration space .",
    "takabayasi  @xcite gives particular attention to the ` quantum stress ' @xmath89 whose gradient appears as a source of ` quantum ' momentum flow in the configuration space momentum conservation equation .",
    "this source of momentum flow is in addition to that generated by the gradient of the ` classical stress ' caused by the external potential .",
    "the quantum potential itself only appears as an additive correction to the external potential in the equation for the total time derivative of the momentum .",
    "the latter expresses the dynamics of a point moving with the configuration space momentum flow at a velocity of @xmath90 and has precisely the form of equation  ( [ eq : for ] ) .",
    "here we see that in order to represent quantum dynamics , such a point is subject to forces arising from momentum dispersion and spatial localisation in addition to the external force .",
    "it is easily shown , from  ( [ eq : disp1a ] ) and  ( [ eq : disp1b ] ) , that @xmath91 and thus @xmath92 the equality applies at maxima of the density @xmath93 , where both energy ( density ) components contribute equally to the quantum potential ( density ) .",
    "this point is illustrated in the examples in section  [ sec : expls ] .",
    "in the momentum representation , the quantum harmonic oscillator is alone in having a quantum potential in the form : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 we invoke the momentum space position dispersion relation derived for a pure state by takabayasi  @xcite , by projecting from phase onto momentum space in a manner similar to that described above for configuration space : @xmath97 thus , @xmath98 , in  ( [ eq : disp1ma ] ) , is identified as the spatial dispersion energy which can be positive or negative .",
    "@xmath99 , in  ( [ eq : disp1 mb ] ) , is the momentum localisation energy term and is proportional to the local curvature of the probability density in momentum space .",
    "therefore , in the momentum representation of the quantum harmonic oscillator , the quantum potential receives positive contributions from the spatial dispersion energy and from the momentum localisation energy .",
    "the latter observation complements the similar one made for the configuration space representation , in which the roles of position and momentum are interchanged .",
    "thus , in the momentum representation of the quantum harmonic oscillator also , is the balance of spatial and momentum dispersion suggestive of the heisenberg uncertainty principle .    as in the configuration space representation",
    ", a distinction may be drawn between the trajectory and continuum interpretations of the quantum system in the momentum representation of the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "similarly , in the latter interpretation , the quantum potential density , @xmath100 , can be expressed as the sum of spatial dispersion and momentum localisation energy densities : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103    in the case of potentials , @xmath48 , of higher polynomial order than two , as shown in  ( [ eq : vq4 ] ) , the momentum representation yields a multi - termed sum for the quantum potential .",
    "thus decomposition of the quantum potential ( density ) into the dispersion and localisation energy ( densities ) , as described above , is not possible in general .",
    "therefore , whilst , in correspondence to  ( [ eq : gec ] ) and  ( [ eq : gedc ] ) , the inequalities : @xmath104 and @xmath105 always hold in the momentum representation , in general , the dispersion and localisation energy ( densities ) do not sum to give the quantum potential energy ( density ) .",
    "to illustrate the discussion of the previous sections , we investigate the symplectic symmetry breaking role and the dispersion and localisation energy components of the quantum potential for two simple systems : a quantum particle in a linear potential and the quantum harmonic oscillator .        in the configuration space representation ,",
    "the stationary one dimensional schrdinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath106 in the potential @xmath107 is : @xmath108 in units where @xmath109 .",
    "( for an analysis of this system in quantum phase space see  @xcite ) .",
    "the physically acceptable solution to this equation is given ( up to a multiplicative constant ) by the airy function  @xcite : @xmath110 @xmath111 is the turning point of a classical particle trajectory of energy @xmath112 initially travelling from @xmath113 and being reflected by the linear potential at @xmath111 to return to @xmath113 .",
    "since the potential is unbounded , @xmath112 may take on a continuum of values . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider the case @xmath114 in which the classical trajectory would be reflected at the origin @xmath115 .",

    "contrary to the linear potential case , the quantum harmonic oscillator does not exhibit the general classical symplectic symmetry breaking features of the quantum potential , as the latter exactly cancels the variation of the external potential in both the configuration and momentum space representations . as a result and despite its symplectic symmetry , the causal trajectories of the quantum harmonic oscillator are not classical in either representation .",
    "however , the existence of the quantum potential ( density ) and its components in both configuration and momentum space does allow adoption of an energy density continuum description of the quantum system in both representations .",
    "in this work , we have reviewed the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics with particular emphasis on the composition and role of the quantum potential . whilst the interpretation is normally presented in configuration space ,",
    "we have attempted to give equal emphasis to its formulation in both configuration space and momentum space . in doing so ,",
    "we have demonstrated how , in general , the quantum potential breaks the symplectic symmetry that exists between these two representations in classical mechanics .",
    "this has been achieved by applying hamilton s equations of dynamics to the effective hamiltonian of the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation .    assuming only general polynomial forms for the kinetic energy operator , @xmath147 , and the potential energy operator , @xmath148 , the corresponding terms in the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation are found , in general , to be expressible as power series in @xmath149 in the configuration space and momentum space representations respectively .",
    "the non-@xmath34 dependent parts of the series become the corresponding classical energy forms if the causal identifications @xmath36 and @xmath40 are respectively adopted in the configuration space and momentum space representations .",
    "the @xmath149 dependent parts of the power series constitute the quantum potential in the two representations .",
    "this series consists of the sum of terms containing products of derivatives of the magnitude and phase of the wavefunction . only in the common case of @xmath150 in configuration space and in the restricted case of @xmath151 in momentum space",
    "does the quantum potential have its familiar single term form proportional to the second derivative of the magnitude of the wavefunction .    in the above latter two cases ,",
    "the quantum potential has been shown to be the sum of a localisation energy and a dispersion energy through a connection with the wigner phase space representation of quantum mechanics .",
    "these intrinsic internal energies distinguish the extended character of quantum systems from the point - like character of individual classical systems from which they are absent . expressing these energies in energy density form",
    "it has been shown how the latter description complements the normal causal description of probability weighted particle trajectories .",
    "thus , as in the example of the momentum representation of a quantum system in a linear potential , the absence of the quantum potential may be complemented by the presence of non - trivial ( in this case , classical ) causal trajectories .",
    "equally , as in the example of the quantum harmonic oscillator , the quantum potential may be accompanied by trivial ( stationary ) causal trajectories .    in summary , the quantum potential breaks the symplectic symmetry of classical mechanics and in its energy density form complements the trajectory description of the causal interpretation quantum mechanics .",
    "the complementary aspects of the localisation and dispersion energy components of the quantum potential and their explicit dependence upon the probability density in either momentum or configuration space , can be interpreted as a manifestation of the heisenberg uncertainty principle and of the extended nature of quantum systems . since the quantum potential is the only @xmath34 dependent energy in the hamiltonian",
    ", it is surely the essentially quantum aspect of the causal interpretation .",
    "we have seen in this paper how , far from being a redundant concept in the causal interpretation , analysis of the quantum potential provides insight into the differences between the dynamics of classical and quantum mechanics .",

    "we show how the full series expansions of equations ( [ eq : sumt ] ) and  ( [ eq : sumv ] ) naturally separate into @xmath34-dependent and @xmath34-independent parts .",
    "the approach may also be applied to the imaginary part functions in equations  ( [ eq : conx ] ) and  ( [ eq : conp ] ) . the analysis is explicitly given for the kinetic energy operator , @xmath30 , but follows through in an obviously similar manner for the potential energy operator , @xmath152 .",
    "thus , in the following , references to @xmath30 should be applied to @xmath152 with the appropriate transformation of the independent variable .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath30 is any real linear function of monomials in the orthogonal components of @xmath31 which span @xmath153-dimensional momentum space : @xmath154 thus , there are no terms containing products of different components of the momentum and @xmath30 is a sum of energies , uniquely associated with each momentum component , which can be separately analysed . from here on we therefore limit the analysis to one momentum component and drop the dimensional index @xmath155 .    the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : sumt ] ) may be expressed as : @xmath156 where @xmath0 . making the identification @xmath157 and expanding each of the exponentials",
    "as a power series gives @xmath158 the extraction of the real part of the multiple summation means that @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the set of even integers .",
    "the expression must not change when we add an arbitrary constant to @xmath18 , ie it must be independent of a constant shift in phase of the wavefunction .",
    "thus all powers of @xmath18 must sum to zero .",
    "this imposes the constraint that only @xmath161 terms can contribute to the summation .",
    "equally , those parts of the partial derivative in equation  ( [ eq : arex ] ) which have non - zero powers of @xmath18 as factors can not contribute to the summation .",
    "this means that @xmath162 is a maximum upper bound on @xmath163 , ie @xmath164 .",
    "however , even with this bound the expanded partial derivative will , in general , have parts with @xmath18 as a factor .",
    "these latter may be eliminated in practice by temporarily setting @xmath165 thus retaining only those parts of @xmath166 which have , as factors , first and higher order derivatives of @xmath18 . in summary , @xmath167_{s:0 } , \\label{eq : arexr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the subscript @xmath168 denotes the process of eliminating terms with @xmath18 as a factor .",
    "the combinations of k and m values that contribute to the above sum are shown graphically in fig.[fig1a ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : arexr ] ) contains only even non - negative positive powers of @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath34-dependent component of the summation consists of terms with positive powers of @xmath34 as factors : @xmath169_{s:0 } , \\label{eq : arexq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the @xmath34-independent component consists only of terms for which @xmath170 : @xmath171 making the identification @xmath36 in  ( [ eq : arexc ] ) we recover the one dimensional classical form of the kinetic energy function assumed in equation  ( [ eq : amon ] ) above .",
