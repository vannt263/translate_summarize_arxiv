    "it is important that the term @xmath6 ( [ sr ] ) contains the electron density matrix @xmath7 which makes it necessary to keep integrals over both coordinate and momentum variables because the corresponding hamiltonians turn out to be nonlocal .",
    "it is also important to observe that both dissipative term @xmath6 and noise term @xmath8 are _ purely real _ functionals .    in order to describe weak localization in the limit @xmath9",
    "it is sufficient to employ the standard picture of time - reversed paths and evaluate the path integral ( [ j ] ) within the saddle point approximation .",
    "it turns out that the term @xmath6 vanishes for any pair of time - reversed paths @xcite while @xmath8 grows with time at all temperatures including @xmath0 and determines the cooperon decay at sufficiently long times .",
    "one can also evaluate the contribution of fluctuations around time - reversed paths which turns out to be significant only at short times , i.e. in the perturbative ( in the interaction ) regime .",
    "the corresponding analysis was carried out in ref . .",
    "employing an exact transformation of the evolution operators we reduced the result to the form allowing to semiclassically evaluate only those path integrals which do not contain the electron density matrix @xmath7 while the latter was kept in its exact form in the corresponding matrix elements which can not grow with time .",
    "this analysis was performed within the accuracy of the _ definition _ of the weak localization correction to conductivity and fully confirmed our earlier results and conclusions .",
    "unfortunately this latter development was completely ignored by jvd who attempted to treat the path integral yet `` somewhat more accurately '' than we do .",
    "jvd s key idea is to effectively integrate out the momentum variables in eq .",

    "( [ tildesr ] ) .",
    "below we will demonstrate that the functional ( [ fvd ] ) is entirely different from the correct one ( [ f0 ] ) and it can not be obtained from the latter by performing momentum integrations or by any other correct means .",
    "a quick glance already at the first jvd s formula ( eq .",
    "( 1a , b ) in ref . ) demonstrates that this and subsequent equations violate the energy - time uncertainty relation .",
    "indeed , on p. 5 of ref .",
    "jvd writes that the double path integral entering his eq .",
    "( 1b ) `` gives the amplitude for an electron with energy @xmath14 to propagate from @xmath15 at time @xmath16 to @xmath17 at @xmath18 times the amplitude for it to propagate from @xmath19 at time @xmath18 to @xmath20 at @xmath21 '' .",
    "thus , in jvd s eq .",
    "( 1 ) and his subsequent analysis both electron _ energy and time _ are simultaneously fixed .",
    "this is a clear * violation of the quantum mechanical energy - time uncertainty relation*. no such amplitude can be defined in quantum mechanics .",
    "let us further examine the `` influence functional '' defined in eqs .",
    "( 2 - 4 ) of ref . .",
    "it is easy to observe that , while our action @xmath6 ( [ sr ] ) is purely real , jvd s action @xmath13 already contains an imaginary part .",
    "since this part effectively adds up to the noise term @xmath8 it would imply that the equilibrium nyquist noise spectrum `` felt '' by electrons in a disordered conductor would be proportional to the combination @xmath22 and not to the commonly accepted @xmath23 which also follows from our expression for @xmath8 ( [ si ] ) , ( [ ri ] ) .",
    "already this observation demonstrates that jvd s `` influence functional '' is fundamentally different from ours .",
    "while the latter takes full account of both classical and quantum noise , jvd s expressions ( [ tildesr]-[imr ] ) would imply `` cutting out '' the quantum noise for small values of @xmath24 . as a result , according to jvd in the limit @xmath25 and @xmath26 electrons would `` feel '' no noise at all . in this limit jvd s @xmath27",
    "_ exactly _ cancels @xmath8 , i.e. the `` influence functional '' @xmath28 ( [ fvd ] ) is identically equal to unity for _ all _ electron paths . in other words ,",
    "jvd s analysis predicts that electron - electron interactions would have _ no influence _",
    "at all on the dc conductivity of a disordered conductor at @xmath0 .",
    "this is obviously not the case for our influence functional @xcite .",
    "our next observation is that jvd s `` influence functional '' * violates causality*. this fact becomes obvious by inspection of analytic properties of the fourier - transformed jvd s function @xmath29 ( [ rer],[imr ] ) which has poles both in the upper and lower half - planes of the @xmath30-variable , hence , implying that the electron motion should be affected by photons coming both from the past and from the future , an obvious nonsense .",
    "in contrast , any correct expression for the kernel @xmath31 should have poles only in the lower half - plane of @xmath30 , which is the case for our expression ( [ ri]-[epsilon ] ) . applying the least action conditions to our action @xmath32-s_0[{\\bm p}_b,{\\bm r}_b]-s_r[{\\bm p}_{f , b},{\\bm r}_{f , b}]\\big ) } { \\left.\\delta ( { \\bm r}_f-{\\bm r}_b)\\right|_{{\\bm r}_f={\\bm r}_b={\\bm r},{\\bm p}_f={\\bm p}_b={\\bm p}}}=0 , \\label{dsdr}\\\\ \\frac{\\delta\\big(s_0[{\\bm p}_f,{\\bm r}_f]-s_0[{\\bm p}_b,{\\bm r}_b]-s_r[{\\bm p}_{f , b},{\\bm r}_{f , b}]\\big ) } { \\left.\\delta ( { \\bm p}_f-{\\bm p}_b)\\right|_{{\\bm r}_f={\\bm r}_b={\\bm r},{\\bm p}_f={\\bm",

    "classical _ equation of motion for a high energy electron in a dissipative environment @xcite @xmath33 where the time integral in a dissipative term extends from @xmath34 to @xmath35 in full agreement with the causality principle .",
    "in contrast , the same equation derived from jvd s action ( [ pe],[tildesr ] ) would take the form @xmath36 where the time integral already runs over all times between @xmath34 and @xmath37 in a direct conflict with the requirement of causality .",
    "in addition , instead of the correct kernel @xmath38 ( [ ri ] ) jvd s eq . ( [ cl2 ] ) contains @xmath39 ( [ rer ] ) in a clear contradiction to the well established results @xcite .",
    "thus , jvd s `` influence functional '' fails already on a _ classical _ level being unable to correctly describe particle s dynamics in a dissipative environment .",
    "in addition to the above problems jvd s `` influence functional '' also * violates fluctuation - dissipation theorem and detailed balance*. the easiest way to observe this violation is to consider the values of @xmath24 large compared to temperature @xmath40 . in that case",
    "the pauli principle should not be important and the term @xmath13 should approach the action @xmath6 evaluated without the pauli principle , e.g. for a muon moving in a metal .",
    "this situation was considered , e.g. , in ref . and",
    "the corresponding expression for @xmath6 obtained there coincides with ( [ sr ] ) where one should now set @xmath7 equal to zero . in this case",
    "fdt is represented by the following relation @xmath41 while fdt ( [ fdt ] ) is manifestly satisfied for our influence functional , jvd s kernel @xmath42 ( [ rer],[imr ] ) , being substituted into eq .",
    "( [ fdt ] ) instead of @xmath43 , obviously violates this relation . as a direct consequence ,",
    "jvd s `` influence functional '' also violates detailed balance .    concluding this section , we have demonstrated that there exists no environment in nature which could be described by the `` influence functional '' defined in eqs .",
    "( 2 - 4 ) of ref . .",
    "hence , this `` influence functional '' is unsuitable for calculations of any physical quantity including , of course , the electron decoherence rate .",
    "we now turn to the main problems of jvd s calculation which have eventually led to alarming consequences outlined above .    as it was already emphasized , the path integral over momentum variables ( eqs .",
    "( [ j]),([s0]),([sr ] ) ) is strongly non - gaussian , and , hence , can not be exactly evaluated .",
    "jvd @xcite does not even attempt to directly perform the momentum integrals .",
    "instead , he carries out a set of manipulations and formulates `` a rule of thumb '' , eq .",
    "unfortunately this central part for the whole analysis ( pp .",
    "54 - 55 of the paper ) is by far less detailed than the rest of the paper and , in fact , contains almost no equal signs ( substituted in eqs .",
    "( b.91-b.93 ) by the sign `` @xmath44 '' ) .    what was actually done by jvd with our influence functional ?",
    "jvd uses it only at the very first step expanding @xmath45 in eqs .",
    "( [ j0],[f0 ] ) in powers of @xmath46 . in this way",
    "jvd reproduces all keldysh diagrams for the problem in question .",
    "this step is correct and  in full agreement with our statements @xcite  demonstrates that no diagrams are missing within our influence functional approach . from this point on jvd",
    "performs his own analysis of the diagrammatic series .",
    "this analysis has no direct connection to any path integral calculation , since all keldysh diagrams can , of course , be also recovered without path integrals .",
    "jvd s key steps are as follows :    1 .   rewriting the keldysh green function for electrons as @xmath47\\tanh\\frac{e-\\omega}{2t}$ ]",
    "jvd neglects @xmath48 on the forward branch of the keldysh contour , i.e. he makes the replacement @xmath49 see his eq .",
    "similarly , on the backward branch of the keldysh contour jvd replaces @xmath50 this approximation is equivalent to simply dropping certain classes of diagrams . already at this point jvd",
    "violates causality for electrons .",
    "jvd splits the pauli factor @xmath51 from @xmath52 ( or , better to say , from the remaining part of @xmath52 containing @xmath53 or @xmath48 only ) and transfers it to the photon propagators @xmath54 on the forward or @xmath55 on the backward branches of the keldysh contour , i.e. he makes the following replacement @xmath56 note , that the energy @xmath24 under @xmath57 is now different from @xmath58 .",
    "according to jvd , @xmath24 is set to be constant which is not sensitive to the pre - history . at this stage jvd",
    "violates the energy - time uncertainty relation as well as causality for photons .",
    "this step in combination with the previous one is equivalent to jvd s `` rule of thumb '' , eq .",
    "( b.91 ) , applied to the first order diagrams .",
    "jvd spreads his `` rule of thumb '' to all orders of the perturbation theory . for that purpose in addition to steps ( 1 ) and",
    "( 2 ) jvd substitutes @xmath59 in all the diagrams whenever more than one photon frequency under @xmath57 is encountered . as a result , all the complicated pauli factors are reduced to a simple and unique form @xmath60 for _ all diagrams in all orders_. hence , all tanh - factors become decoupled from the electron lines and can now be absorbed in the photon green functions .",
    "after this step electrons are not anymore sensitive to the pauli principle .",
    "in addition , this manipulation leads to violation of fdt , since it effectively breaks down thermal equilibrium in the photon subsystem .     appears only after jvd s `` rule of thumb '' is applied , while the initial exact expression for this diagram is by far more complicated and it does not contain this simple combination of coth and tanh.,width=340 ]    summarizing , the above set of steps is equivalent to ( a ) dropping certain classes of diagrams and ( b ) replacing infinitely many remaining diagrams by completely different ones .",
    "jvd s `` rule of thumb '' is also illustrated in fig",
    "unfortunately no serious justification for these manipulations was offered by jvd .",
    "for instance , according to jvd @xcite , some contributions to the cooperon self - energy corresponding to the so - called hikami boxes @xcite should vanish after impurity averaging in the first order in the limit of zero frequency and wave vectors . for some unclear reasons",
    "jvd believes that this observation should be sufficient in order to perform his step ( 1 ) , i.e. to disregard terms with @xmath48 and @xmath53 , already _ before _ impurity averaging and _ in all orders _ of the perturbation theory .    as for the step ( 2 ) , according to jvd it is possible to neglect all energy fluctuations `` if one so chooses '' .",
    "this approximation `` is expected to work well if the relevant physics is dominated by low frequencies '' .",
    "this argument is logically inconsistent , since in the very beginning it already _ assumes _ what one needs to _ prove _ in the end . in practice , as it is argued by jvd in sec .",
    "b6.2 , one should disregard `` accumulation of energy changes '' in all vertex diagrams in all orders and also in the self - energy diagrams in the second and all higher orders in the interaction .",
    "our analysis , in contrast , demonstrates that this `` energy accumulation '' is important and can not be disregarded .",
    "the combination of jvd s steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) makes it impossible to fully reconstruct all contributions to the cooperon already in the first order in the interaction . for instance , the first order non - golden - rule terms defined , e.g. , in eqs .",
    "( 70 ) of ref . are completely missing in jvd s eqs .",
    "( 1 - 4 ) and his subsequent analysis . the time dependence encoded in these non - golden - rule terms is indeed slower than linear",
    ". nevertheless , these first order terms are important at @xmath26 since in 1d and 2d cases they actually _ diverge _ in the long time limit and , hence , also contribute to decoherence @xcite , see sec .",
    "ivb of ref . .",
    "jvd s step ( 3 ) introduces yet one more uncontrolled approximation by neglecting all but one photon frequencies under each tanh . to support this step jvd",
    "argues that all these frequencies are smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth stressing that in the exact diagrammatic expansion the photon frequencies are _ not _ restricted by temperature .",
    "the contribution of high frequencies is important and may even lead to ultra - violet divergencies . only after the steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) such divergencies could disappear .",
    "however , even if one adopts these steps , it would still be inconsistent to disregard all but one photon frequency . since all these frequencies can be of the same order ,",
    "it is simply a matter of consistency of any approximation to either keep or disregard them all . in either case",
    "it would then be impossible to recover the desired combination @xmath61 .",
    "perhaps , this observation might suggest a clue why only one photon frequency was kept by jvd under each tanh .",
    "the net result of all these manipulations is nothing but simple exponentiation of the first order self - energy diagrams @xcite evaluated within the approximation which effectively ignores all contributions not containing the combination @xmath61 . for the latter reason already the first order terms of the perturbation series",
    "can not be fully recovered from jvd s eqs .",
    "( 1 - 4 ) . however , even if all the first order terms would be correctly reproduced by jvd , it would still be completely useless to simply exponentiate the first order result .",
    "the problem in question is essentially non - perturbative and , hence , contributions of all orders should be fully included @xcite .",
    "after all these manipulations with diagrams jvd goes back to path integrals and constructs the functional ( [ fvd ] ) which , being expanded in the interaction , should generate jvd s diagrams obtained after his steps ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) .",
    "obviously , this functional has nothing to do with our influence functional ( [ f0 ] ) no matter whether one carries out momentum integrations or not .",
    "in fact , jvd himself acknowledges that `` an accurate treatment of effects occurring in second or higher order is beyond the accuracy of '' his `` influence functional approach '' .",
    "in contrast to ( [ fvd ] ) , our influence functional ( [ f0 ] )  as was also confirmed by jvd ",
    "includes all rpa diagrams in all orders and , hence , is suitable for non - perturbative calculations .",
    "thus , the crucial difference between ( [ f0 ] ) and ( [ fvd ] ) becomes evident already by careful reading of last paragraphs of sec .",
    "b6.2 of ref . .",
    "unfortunately in other parts of that paper the wording is sometimes not so clear .",
    "for instance , in sec .",
    "3 on p. 9 jvd first acknowledges that `` we got it completely right in the position - time representation '' and then continues `` unfortunately , however , it did not occur to them to use the frequency representation ( 4e ) '' .",
    "having read these statements , the reader could easily conclude that jvd only passes to a different representation of _ the same _ influence functional .",
    "in reality , however , at this point jvd _ replaces _ our correct influence functional ( [ f0 ] ) by a very different object ( [ fvd ] ) which properties have already been discussed in sec .",
    "i of this comment .    in sec .",
    "jvd incorrectly ascribes to us certain manipulations with _ his _ functional ( [ fvd ] ) which we have never performed and could never perform simply because we do not have such a functional at all in any of our papers .",
    "the procedure discussed in sec",
    ". 4 of ref . has , therefore , nothing to do with our saddle point analysis @xcite and jvd s claim that this analysis `` neglects recoil effects '' is highly misleading .",
    "obviously , all recoil effects are fully included in our path integral ( [ j0])-([f0 ] ) .",
    "evaluation of this non - gaussian path integral within the saddle point approximation is a legitimate and standard mathematical procedure .",
    "it is certainly correct within its applicability range and by no means it implies neglecting recoil effects , as it was incorrectly alleged by jvd .",
    "for completeness , let us briefly address mdsa papers @xcite .",
    "the analysis in sec .",
    "vii of ref . is essentially identical to that of ref . and",
    ", hence , all our critique of the latter paper equally applies to mdsa s work @xcite . in particular , the action defined in eqs .",
    "( 93)-(94 ) of ref . as well as mdsa s",
    "`` plausibility arguments '' also violate fundamental principles of quantum theory as already discussed in sec .",
    "i of this comment .",
    "mdsa s statement that our effective action @xmath46 `` is essentially the same as '' that defined in their eqs .",
    "( 93)-(94 ) is explicitly incorrect , as it was already argued above .",
    "these two actions are so different , that they even yield different _ classical _ equations of motion , respectively eqs .",
    "( [ cl1 ] ) and ( [ cl2 ] ) .    the mdsa s discussion of both recoil effects and the pauli principle is again highly misleading as it is based exclusively on the golden rule approximation and clearly contradicts the energy - time uncertainty relation . since mdsa use the pauli principle only as the energy constraint and argue that electrons lose coherence `` by spontaneous emission '' , their line of reasoning is not at all specific to fermions and can equally be applied , e.g. , to a quantum particle interacting with caldeira - leggett environment of harmonic oscillators .",
    "unfortunately mdsa avoid even mentioning about the exact solution for the latter model which can be considered as a primer on zero temperature quantum decoherence by interactions as well as a demonstration of insufficiency of any golden - rule - type approximation for the problem in question .    as for ref .",
    "its main drawback lies in the assumption of purely exponential decay of the cooperon _ at all times _ adopted by the authors . with this assumption",
    "any time dependence slower than exponential would simply be excluded from the analysis from the very beginning .",
    "the only contribution which could be captured under this assumption is again the golden rule combination @xmath61 .",
    "in essence , all three approaches @xcite do not go beyond exponentiating the first order golden rule terms of the perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , it is not at all surprising that all three approaches yield the same incorrect results for the electron decoherence rate at @xmath0 .    despite all our critique",
    "the works @xcite have at least one important merit .",
    "namely , these authors have re - derived our influence functional and acknowledged that our expressions ( [ sr ] ) , ( [ si ] ) are exact .",
    "this observation is crucial as it leaves practically no room for further discussions .",
    "moreover , it makes it easy also for non - experts to judge which conclusion is correct without even looking into complicated diagrams and path integrals .",
    "it is actually sufficient to observe  as jvd and mdsa do  that both @xmath6 and @xmath8 are _ purely real_.    consider two sums over @xmath62 realizations : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are all real numbers .",
    "obviously , @xmath67 is transformed into @xmath68 by a trivial shift @xmath69 .",
    "provided all @xmath65 are much larger than one , @xmath70 , both @xmath68 and @xmath67 are exponentially small , @xmath71 no matter what the values @xmath64 and @xmath66 are .",
    "the same is , of course , true for our path integral , one should only replace realizations by trajectories and numbers by functionals @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "regrettably , these trivial algebraic considerations were not respected by jvd .",
    "( very end of sec .",
    "b5.8 ) he argues that `` this general argument would work if the measure used in the path integral were real , however , it does not apply to the present case ' ' ... `` where the measure @xmath74 is complex '' .",
    "in other words , jvd agrees that in the sum @xmath68 an imaginary part @xmath75 has no chance to cancel a real one @xmath65 , but  according to him  this cancellation can happen in the sum @xmath67 where a complex measure @xmath76 is added .",
    "jvd concludes `` indeed , it is shown in the main text'' ... ``that contributions from @xmath77 and @xmath8 do partially cancel each other '' .",
    "unfortunately it did not occur to jvd to make a shift @xmath78 in order to observe the full equivalence of @xmath68 and @xmath67 .",
    "instead , he expands the exponent under the sum in @xmath67 to the first order in @xmath75 and @xmath65 , observes that both contributions @xmath79 and @xmath80 may have real parts which can ( partially or exactly ) cancel each other and then re - exponentiates the result , i.e. writes @xmath81 in this way jvd erroneously arrives at the `` cancellation '' in the exponent .",
    "there is , of course , no need to analyze infinite series of complicated diagrams in order to see that the quantity @xmath82 has in general nothing to do with @xmath67 , except in the perturbative limit @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "finally , let us emphasize yet another point which we have already discussed in ref . .",
    "very generally , evaluating a non - gaussian path integral around certain saddle point paths , at @xmath26 one arrives at an effective action @xmath85 , \\label{scl}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the classical ( @xmath87-independent ) action on the relevant saddle point paths and @xmath88 represents the quantum correction ( @xmath68 being the pre - exponent ) .",
    "obviously , this quantum correction can only be important if @xmath89 , i.e. in the perturbative ( short time ) limit @xmath90 , in which case partial cancellation of the term @xmath91 by the term @xmath92 is , of course , possible .",
    "however , for @xmath93 ( i.e. for @xmath94 ) there is no way to cancel the classical action @xmath91 by the quantum correction which formally tends to zero for @xmath95 .",
    "hence , in order to determine the scale @xmath96 it is absolutely sufficient to evaluate the action @xmath97 on pairs of time - reversed saddle point paths , find the classical ( @xmath87-independent ) action @xmath86 and obtain the decoherence time @xmath96 from the condition @xmath98 .",
