    "the characteristic variation time scale of a few tens of minutes , comparable to the dynamical time at the last stable orbit , indicates that they are also produced within a few @xmath3 of the black hole .",
    "the spectra , polarization , and variability , especially when considering results from simultaneous multi - wavelength observations , suggest that the nir radiation is emitted through synchrotron processes and the x - rays are likely due to the synchrotron self - comptonization ( eckart et al .",
    "2006a , 2006b ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "the flares can be triggered by rapid releases of magnetic field energy near the black hole , which then heats electrons to a few tens of mev producing the observed emission ( liu et al .",

    "we note that the disk structure at small radii is very sensitive to the stress at the inner boundary @xmath65 . here",
    "the stress is chosen such that there is no net angular momentum flux through the disk , which is appropriate for strongly magnetized disks .",
    "the formulae for calculating polarized synchrotron emission are given by melia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who treat the flow as a slim disk . since the millimeter and shorter wavelength emissions",
    "are mostly produced within 10 @xmath3 , where electrons are relativistic , as indicated by the profiles of @xmath46 and @xmath16 , the emission and absorption are dominated by the extraordinary emission component and the faraday conversion dominates the faraday rotation in the millimeter and sub - millimeter bands ( melrose 1997 ) . then the emission , absorption , and dispersion vectors defined by landi deglinnocenti and landolfi ( 2004 ) are in the same direction . with the slim disk approximation ,",
    "the plasma is uniform along a light ray and the dispersion effects can be neglected . so the formulae given by melia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) remain valid .",
    "considering the vertical structure of the disk and the inhomogeneities caused by turbulence may reduce the level of linear polarization and induce circular polarization as implied by equations 5.74a and 5.74b of landi deglinnocenti and landolfi ( 2004 ) .",
    "a recent study of the magneto - rotational - instability indicates that @xmath66 when the turbulence saturates ( pessah et al .",
    "2006 ) . in principle , @xmath54 can also be determined by realistic mhd simulations .",
    "then the observed spectrum and polarization can give tight constraints on the disk inclination angle @xmath31 and @xmath34 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ f1.eps ] compares the model predicted spectrum and linear polarization with observations .",
    "the thick dashed line in the top panel gives the spectrum of the fiducial model with @xmath67 , which fits the millimeter to nir spectrum .",
    "the spectral index below @xmath68 ghz is @xmath69 , which is determined by the structure of the disk .",
    "emission from different radii peaks at different frequencies , above which the source becomes optically thin , and lower frequency emission is produced at relatively larger radii .",
    "the dotted line fit the low frequency spectrum with @xmath70 $ ] jy . as mentioned in the introduction , this component is likely associated with an outflow and its linear polarization is negligible ( bower et al .",
    "the thick solid line is the sum of the two , which fits the broadband spectrum .",
    "although most of the emission from the disk is produced in the optically thin regime , the linear polarization at lower frequencies is suppressed due to the dominance of the unpolarized component .",
    "the polarization is significant only in the millimeter and shorter wavelength range as shown in the middle panel , where the thick line corresponds to the fiducial model , and the two thin lines have @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the polarization fraction in the sub - millimeter range increases dramatically with the increase of @xmath31 .",
    "our fitting to the observations gives an @xmath31 of @xmath73 .",
    "more accurate polarization observations above @xmath74 ghz may give a better measurement of this angle .",
    "the thin dashed lines in the top panel give the spectra for the two profiles with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the emission spectrum , especially in the nir band , is very sensitive to the electron heating rate . a good measurement of sagittarius a * s quiescent flux in the nir band can lead to an accurate determination of @xmath34 ( ghez et al .",
    "2005b ; clnet et al .",
    "the model predicts an nir spectral index of @xmath77 .",
    "any evidence of a harder quiescent nir spectrum would suggest a non - thermal emission component .",
    "observations show that the position angle of the intrinsic polarization is @xmath6 ( macquart et al . 2006 ; marrone et al .",
    "our model predicts that the emission is polarized along the axis of the disk below @xmath78 ghz .",
    "the axis of the disk therefore has a position angle of @xmath6 .",
    "future vlbi imaging may be able to test this prediction ( shen et al .",
    "2005 ; bromley et al .",
    "2001 ; huang et al .",
    "2007 ) . for small values of @xmath31 ,",
    "the model predicts that the position angle of the polarization flips by @xmath7 in the sub - millimeter range due to the dominance of the high frequency emission by the blue shifted side .",
    "we note that in the nir band , where the emission is also dominated by the blue - shifted side , the corresponding position angle of the polarization is @xmath79 , which is consistent with recent observations ( eckart et al .",
    "2006b ; meyer et al .",
    "the bottom panel shows the fitting to the position angle of the observed linear polarization . here",
    "an external faraday rotation has been introduced following macquart et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and marrone et al .",
    "such an external faraday rotation may originate from the outflow as suggested by beckert and falcke ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have shown that the disk model can account for the millimeter spectrum and polarization , the @xmath80 difference in the position angle of the polarized sub - millimeter and nir emissions .",
    "our best - fit model predicts a @xmath81 polarization at 150 ghz , a very soft quiescent state nir spectrum , and a disk inclination angle of @xmath82 with the axis aligning at @xmath6 position angle . future polarimetric spectroscopy and imaging will be able to test the model and/or better constrain the parameters .",
    "since @xmath54 is currently not well determined by simulations , the fitting to the observed data is not unique . for @xmath56 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 g s@xmath59 , and @xmath67",
    ", we obtain essentially the same emission spectrum and polarization from the disk as the fiducial model",
    ". a better constraint of @xmath54 by simulations is therefore critical to pin down the rest of the model parameters with simultaneous spectrum and polarization observations .",
    "the best - fit orientation of the disk is not sensitive to @xmath54 .",
    "however , since most of the emission is produced near the last stable orbit @xmath65 , the stress at this radius and the emission from the plunging region may affect the best - fit value of @xmath31 .",
    "a full general relativistic mhd simulation will not only address these issues and remove the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath54 , but also treat the vertical structure of the disk and the effects of winds or outflows properly , which may explain the observed external faraday rotation and the centimeter emission component ( liu & melia 2001 ; yuan et al .",
    "2002 ; sharma et al .",
    "however , to apply mhd simulations to sagittarius a * directly , one needs an advanced treatment of the electron heating by turbulence , takes into account the general relativistic light binding effects , and does the transfer of polarized emission in a turbulent flow properly .",
    "the plasma dispersion effects may induce circular polarization and introduce comparable modification to the spectrum and linear polarization as the general relativistic effects ( melrose 1997 ; broderick & blandford 2004 ) .",
    "these investigations may eventually lead to a measurement of the black hole spin .",
    "compared with the previous models of a small hot accretion torus ( melia et al .",
    "2001 ; bromley et al .",
    "2001 ) , we make several significantly improvements .",
    "a more realistic treatment of electron heating by turbulence replaces the assumption of one temperature flow in the original model .",
    "this also makes the results almost independent of the outer boundary radius and temperature(s ) . with the pseudo - newtonian potential ,",
    "the inner radius is not a free parameter anymore and fixed at the last stable orbit .",
    "the zero stress inner boundary condition is replaced by the zero angular momentum flux condition .",
    "although other models may also explain the observations studied in this paper ( e.g. yuan et al .",
    "2002 ) , the model presented here has less parameters and assumptions on the dynamics of the accretion flow and/or outflow and therefore likely reveals the dominant physical processes responsible for the observed emission .",
