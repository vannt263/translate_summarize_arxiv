    "the _ polyhedral cayley trick _ gives a canonical bijection between _ mixed subdivisions _ of the minkowski sum @xmath15 of several polytopes @xmath16 and all polyhedral subdivisions of a certain polytope @xmath17 called the _ cayley embedding _ of @xmath18 .",
    "the correspondence was first developed by sturmfels  @xcite for the case of coherent subdivisions , and then generalized to all subdivisions by huber et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "originally , the trick was devised as a way of understanding and computing fine ( i.e. , minimal with respect to refinement ) mixed subdivisions , taking advantage of the much deeper knowledge and specific software that exists for triangulations .",
    "but the trick can be also used in reverse , to understand triangulations of the @xmath19-dimensional polytope @xmath20 in terms of a @xmath21-dimensional object .",
    "this is what we do here .",
    "specially interesting is the case when all the @xmath22 s are copies of a simplex @xmath23 .",
    "then , the cayley trick relates polyhedral subdivisions of @xmath24 to mixed subdivisions of the dilation @xmath25 . if , moreover , we fix @xmath26 , then the mixed subdivisions we have to study are essentially the same as lozenge tilings of a triangle of size @xmath10 . using this interpretation we prove :    [ thm : main ]    1 .   the graph of flips between triangulations of @xmath27 is connected ( theorem  [ thm : connected ] ) and it has diameter @xmath28 ( corollary  [ coro : diameter ] ) .",

    "part ( 1 ) of the statement is interesting for two reasons . on the one hand , there are not many examples where the graph of flips is known to be connected .",
    "essentially , only the case of dimension at most 2 ( classical ) , codimension at most 3  @xcite and that of cyclic polytopes  @xcite . on the other hand , since all triangulations of products of simplices are unimodular",
    ", the graph of flips has a very direct interpretation in toric algebraic geometry ; see theorem  [ thm : torichilbert ] below .",
    "besides the results in theorem  [ thm : main ] , the cayley trick allows to picture triangulations of @xmath38 as @xmath39-dimensional objects .",
    "we include pictures of all ( non - isomorphic ) triangulations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( figures  [ fig : twobytwo ] and  [ fig:35classes ] ) . also , of non - regular triangulations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 and of a non - regular coarse subdivision of @xmath40 ( figures  [ fig : nonregular ] and  [ fig:3x3nonregular ] ) . @xmath13 and @xmath41 are the minimal products of simplices that have non - regular triangulations . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our subdivision of @xmath40 is the first known non - regular coarse subdivision of a product of simplices .",
    "subdivisions and triangulations of @xmath42 are interesting from several perspectives .",
    "they have been studied for their own sake in  @xciteand  ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.3.d ) and they have been used as building blocks to find efficient triangulations of high dimensional cubes  @xcite or to find disconnected flip - graphs  @xcite . also , @xmath24 is an example of a _ totally unimodular _",
    "polytope ; that is , a lattice polytope all the simplices of which have the same volume .",
    "this implies it is equidecomposable  @xcite , i.e. , all its triangulations have the same @xmath43-vector",
    ". from the @xmath43-vector of any of its triangulations one can recover , for example , its erhart polynomial .    from a more algebraic point of view",
    ", the toric ideal associated to the vertex set of @xmath24 is a fundamental object .",
    "it is the determinantal ideal generated by the @xmath44-minors of a @xmath45-matrix , and the variety associated to it is the _ segre embedding _ of @xmath46 in @xmath47 .",
    "the study of this ideal has connections to enumeration , sampling and optimization for contingency tables and transportation problems ( cf .",
    "* chapter 5 ) ) .    in this context , part ( 1 ) of theorem  [ thm : main ] has the following algebro - geometric application : every lattice point set defines a toric ( binomial ) ideal and a toric hilbert scheme .",
    "contrary to standard hilbert schemes , toric hilbert schemes are sometimes non - connected  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for a totally unimodular polytope , connectivity of the corresponding toric hilbert scheme is equivalent to connectivity of the graph of triangulations ( cf .",
    "@xcite and theorem 10.13 in  @xcite ) .",
    "hence :    [ thm : torichilbert ] the toric hilbert scheme of the determinantal ideal of @xmath8 minors of a @xmath9 matrix is connected .",
    "another recent source of interest in triangulations of @xmath48 comes from tropical geometry .",
    "develin and sturmfels  @xcite have proved that the combinatorial types of point configurations with @xmath10 points in the tropical space of dimension @xmath49 are in bijective correspondence to the _ regular _ subdivisions of @xmath24 . via this relation",
    ", we prove :    [ corollary  [ coro : nonregular2 ] ] [ thm : tropical ] for every fixed @xmath0 , the number of regular subdivisions of @xmath50 grows as @xmath51 while the number of non - regular subdivisions grows as @xmath3 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : after a first section with preliminaries on the cayley trick , section  [ sec : labeling ] shows how to study mixed subdivisions from a purely geometric point of view .",
    "the results hold for arbitrary mixed subdivisions , but have a specially simple form for dilations of a simplex .",
    "sections  [ sec : lozenge1 ] and  [ sec : lozenge2 ] contain our main results , on triangulations of @xmath52 .",
    "the first explores the relation between mixed subdivisions of @xmath53 and lozenge tilings , and the second uses it to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : tropical ] describes the relation between regular subdivisions of @xmath1 and tropical polytopes in @xmath54-space , and proves theorem  [ thm : tropical ] .",
    "except for theorem  [ thm : free ] , the contents of this section are special cases of results from  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath55 be a polytope in @xmath56 .",
    "a _ cell _ of @xmath55 is any sub - polytope of the same dimension as @xmath55 and whose vertices are a subset of those of @xmath55 .",
    "a _ polyhedral subdivision _ of @xmath55 is any family of cells which cover @xmath55 and intersect properly , meaning that @xmath57 is a common face of both @xmath58 and @xmath59 for every pair of cells @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the subdivision .",
    "this definition is a special case of the definition of polyhedral subdivisions of a point configuration  @xcite .",
    "polyhedral subdivisions form a poset under the refinement relation @xmath60 the minimal elements in this poset , i.e. , those subdivisions whose cells are all simplices , are the _ triangulations _ of @xmath55 .",
    "the unique maximal element in the poset is the _ trivial subdivision _ , which has the whole polytope @xmath55 as its only cell .",
    "the subdivisions which refine only the trivial one are called _",
    "coarse_.    a polyhedral subdivision is called _ regular _ ( or , sometimes , coherent ) if it can be obtained as the orthogonal projection of the lower facets of a @xmath61-dimensional polytope .",
    "equivalently , @xmath62 is regular if there is a height function @xmath63 such that for every cell @xmath64 the points @xmath65 lie in a hyperplane that passes strictly below all other points @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 be convex polytopes .",
    "we in principle do not need to assume them to be full - dimensional , but we require their minkowski sum to be .",
    "this minkowski sum is defined as : @xmath68    a _ minkowski cell _ of the minkowski sum @xmath69 is any full - dimensional polytope @xmath70 , where each @xmath71 is a ( perhaps not full - dimensional ) polytope with vertices among those of @xmath22 .",
    "a _ mixed subdivision _ of @xmath69 is any family @xmath62 of minkowski cells which cover @xmath72 and intersect properly as minkowski sums , meaning that for any two cells @xmath73 and @xmath74 in @xmath62 and for every @xmath75 , the polytopes @xmath71 and @xmath76 intersect properly ( their intersection is a face of both ) .",
    "we have intentionally decided to slightly abuse notation in these definitions and in the rest of the paper , to simplify it and to make the geometry more apparent . indeed , although we speak of `` mixed subdivisions of @xmath77 '' , the concept depends not only on the polytope @xmath55 but also on the particular minkowski decomposition of it that we are given .",
    "the same occurs in the definition of proper intersection of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . to resolve this ambiguity ,",
    "_ every time we write a minkowski sum , the expression @xmath78 should be formally understood as an ordered @xmath10-tuple of polytopes @xmath79_. only in sentences like `` a family of minkowski cells covers @xmath72 '' we are referring to the underlying polytope resulting from the sum .",
    "in particular , if there are different ways of obtaining a certain subpolytope of @xmath55 as a sum of subpolytopes from the @xmath22 s , we consider these as different minkowski cells and we have to specify which of them we are using in a particular mixed subdivision .",
    "for example , part ( a ) of figure  [ fig : twosquares ] shows a mixed subdivision of the minkowski sum of two equal squares . below the figure ,",
    "each of the six minkowski cells is expressed as a sum of sub - polytopes of the squares @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "clearly , the exchange of all the @xmath82 s and @xmath83 s in these expressions would still provide a ( different ) mixed subdivision , with the same picture . on the other hand , considering @xmath84 and @xmath85 would not provide a mixed subdivision , since these two minkowski cells do not intersect properly .",
    "@xmath86 @xmath87    part ( b ) of the figure shows another reason why the `` labeling '' of cells as minkowski sums is important .",
    "there , the same minkowski sum of two equal squares is decomposed into cells which intersect properly as polytopes and which individually can be considered minkowski cells , but which can not be labeled in a way that makes them intersect properly in the minkowski sense . in other words ,",
    "the picture is not compatible with any mixed subdivision .",
    "our treatment of mixed subdivision is formally different , but equivalent to , the one in  @xcite .",
    "there , in order to keep track of the minkowski decompositions of cells , instead of speaking of the sum of polytopes @xmath72 the authors speak of the sum of point sets @xmath88 , where each @xmath89 is the vertex set of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath88 is considered as a multiset , where different `` points '' ( different minkowski sums ) may have identical geometric coordinates .    for the reader familiar with the theory of fiber polytopes ( cf .",
    "chapter 10 in  @xcite ) , mixed subdivisions of @xmath72 can also be described as the subdivisions which are @xmath90-induced , where @xmath90 is the natural projection @xmath91 this is lemma 2.4 in  @xcite .",
    "as in the case of subdivisions , mixed subdivisions form a poset .",
    "a minkowski cell @xmath73 is smaller than ( or contained in ) another one @xmath74 if for every @xmath92 we have @xmath93 .",
    "we write @xmath94 if this happens .",
    "this induces the following refinement relation among mixed subdivisions : @xmath95    the unique maximal element in this poset is again the trivial subdivision with only one minkowski cell @xmath96 .",
    "the minimal elements are called _ fine mixed subdivisions_. in proposition  [ prop : fine ] we will see that fine mixed subdivisions are characterized in terms of what minkowski cells they use .",
    "this is analogous to the fact that `` fine polyhedral subdivisions '' ( i.e. , triangulations ) of a polytope are the polyhedral subdivisions whose cells are simplices . as in the case of subdivisions ,",
    "we call _ coarse mixed subdivisions _ those which only refine the trivial one .",
    "they do not have an easy intrinsic characterization , as far as we know .",
    "a mixed subdivision of @xmath18 is called _ coherent _ if it can be obtained as the orthogonal projection of the lower facets of a @xmath61-dimensional minkowski sum @xmath97 , where each @xmath98 orthogonally projects to the corresponding @xmath22 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath62 is regular if there are height functions @xmath99 such that for every cell @xmath100 the points @xmath101 lie in a hyperplane that passes strictly below all other points @xmath102      as before , let @xmath18 be polytopes in @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath103 be an affine basis in @xmath104 and let @xmath105 be the inclusion @xmath106 .",
    "we define @xmath107 we call @xmath108 the _ cayley embedding _ of @xmath109,  ,@xmath110",
    ". we will primarily be interested in the cayley embedding of @xmath10 copies of the same polytope @xmath55 .",
    "clearly , it equals @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the simplex with vertices @xmath103 .",
    "the cayley trick ( see  @xcite for a full exposition ) is a poset isomorphism between polyhedral subdivisions of the cayley embedding and mixed subdivisions of the minkowski sum .",
    "more precisely , observe that for any choice of affine coordinates @xmath113 in the simplex @xmath112 , the intersection of @xmath20 with the affine subspace @xmath114 equals the `` weighted minkowski sum '' @xmath115 . choosing @xmath116 gives a ( scaled ) copy of the standard minkowski sum .",
    "what the cayley trick says is that :     -    1 .   for any polyhedral subdivision of @xmath20 ,",
    "intersecting its cells with @xmath117 we get a mixed subdivision of @xmath118 .",
    "2 .   this correspondence is a poset isomorphism between polyhedral subdivisions of @xmath20 and mixed subdivisions of @xmath72 , and bijects regular subdivisions of @xmath20 to coherent mixed subdivisions of @xmath72 .",
    "part ( 1 ) , and hence one direction of part ( 2 ) , are straightforward : every full - dimensional cell in a subdivision of @xmath20 is itself a cayley embedding @xmath119 of certain subpolytopes @xmath120 , and hence its intersection with @xmath121 is a minkowski cell in @xmath118 .",
    "the other direction , that every mixed subdivision arises in this way , can be easily proved using different values of @xmath122 : the `` minkowski intersection property '' of the cells in a mixed subdivision @xmath62 of @xmath123 guarantees that @xmath62 induces a mixed subdivision of @xmath115 for every @xmath124 ( by just replacing each minkowski cell @xmath73 by its weighted version @xmath125 ) and the cells @xmath126 for @xmath64 form the desired polyhedral subdivision of @xmath20 .      when all the polytopes @xmath22 are copies of a single polytope @xmath128 , then @xmath129 .",
    "hence , the cayley trick is a bijection between subdivisions of the product @xmath111 and mixed subdivisions of the dilation @xmath130 of @xmath55 .",
    "the main topic of this paper is to take advantage of this fact in order to study triangulations of @xmath111 , via fine mixed subdivisions of @xmath131 .",
    "here comes a first result in this direction .    in the action of the affine symmetry group of @xmath132 on triangulations of @xmath133 , every orbit has exactly @xmath34 elements ( that is , the action is free ) .",
    "in particular , the number of triangulations of @xmath133 is divisible by @xmath34 .",
    "[ thm : free ]    the action of the permutation group , when regarded in the corresponding mixed subdivision of @xmath130 , amounts to a mere permutation of the minkowski summands of every minkowski cell , without affecting the cell itself ( as a polytope ) .",
    "in particular , if some permutation sends a mixed subdivision @xmath62 to itself , it will send every minkowski cell of @xmath62 to itself .",
    "hence , it suffices to prove that for every fine mixed subdivision @xmath62 and every permutation @xmath134 there is a minkowski cell @xmath73 that is not invariant under reordering of the summands ( that is to say , in which @xmath135 for some @xmath92 ) .",
    "finding such cells is easy .",
    "take any @xmath92 such that @xmath136 and let @xmath73 be a cell in which @xmath71 is full - dimensional . these are easy to find in the cayley embedding : they are the ones with a full - dimensional ( in @xmath55 ) intersection with the face @xmath137 of @xmath133 , where @xmath138 is the @xmath92th vertex of @xmath112 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : free ] can be proved directly ( and easily ) in the world of triangulations of @xmath111 .",
    "what we want to emphasize is that the proof is much more transparent using the cayley trick . in particular",
    ", we have not found this result in the bibliography about triangulations of the product of two simplices  @xcite .",
    "we said earlier ( and illustrated with figure  [ fig : twosquares ] ) that there may be different ways in which a given polyhedral subdivision of @xmath139 can be labeled as a mixed subdivision . in this section",
    "we address the problem of what additional information is needed to make the mixed subdivision unique .",
    "we start with a straightforward , but useful , observation :    [ lemma : facets ] let @xmath140 be a subset of indices .",
    "let @xmath62 be a mixed subdivision of @xmath123 .",
    "then , the following is a mixed subdivision of @xmath141 : @xmath142    to see that the cells in @xmath143 cover @xmath141 one can use a limiting process : for each @xmath144 the cells @xmath145 form a mixed subdivision of @xmath146 .",
    "if we fix @xmath147 for the indices in @xmath62 and make all other @xmath124 s go to zero , the minkowski sum tends to @xmath141 . that the cells intersect properly in the minkowski sense is straightforward .",
    "this result can be easily understood in the cayley embedding : @xmath148 is a face of @xmath20 and , certainly , every polyhedral subdivision of @xmath20 induces a subdivision of it .",
    "[ thm : labels ] let @xmath62 be a polyhedral subdivision of @xmath123 and suppose that a labeling of it as a mixed subdivision exists .",
    "assume further that all the @xmath22 have the same dimension .",
    "if we know :    1 .",
    "the subdivisions @xmath149 induced by @xmath62 in each of the individual @xmath22 s , and 2 .   which cell of @xmath62 collapses to each full - dimensional cell of each @xmath150 ,    then the whole mixed subdivision can be recovered from that data ( that is to say , @xmath62 is the only mixed subdivision compatible with that information and there is an algorithm to recover the whole labeling ) .",
    "we work with one @xmath92 at a time .",
    "that is to say , we are going to fix @xmath92 and show how to recover the @xmath92-th summand @xmath71 of a certain cell @xmath64 .",
    "we argue by induction on the codimension of @xmath71 .",
    "the hypotheses give us the case of codimension zero .",
    "so , suppose that we already know the @xmath92-th summand of all cells for which that summand has dimension @xmath151 .",
    "let @xmath71 be a @xmath152-dimensional cell in @xmath150 .",
    "our goal is to determine all maximal cells of @xmath62 whose @xmath92-th component is precisely @xmath71 :     first , if a cell @xmath153 of @xmath62 has been determined to have as @xmath92-th summand a cell @xmath154 that contains @xmath71 ( hence as a face ) , then the faces of @xmath153 in any of the directions defined by the ( relatively open ) normal cone ) of @xmath71 in @xmath155 will have @xmath71 as their @xmath92-th component .     second , if a full - dimensional cell @xmath156 has been determined by the previous rule to have a face with @xmath92-th summand equal to @xmath71 then its @xmath92-th summand contains @xmath71 as a face .",
    "in particular , it either has been determined already or equals @xmath71 .",
    "our claim is that applying these two rules we can recover all the cells whose @xmath92-th summand is @xmath71 . a way to see it is in the process that gives @xmath150 as the limit of mixed subdivisions of @xmath157 then @xmath124 goes to zero .",
    "when @xmath124 is very close to zero , all the cells whose @xmath92-th summand is @xmath71 become very close to @xmath71 itself and certainly we can go from any of them to one that becomes close to the afore - mentioned @xmath155 traversing only cells whose @xmath92-th summand is @xmath71 .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : facets ] makes it easy to show that fine mixed subdivisions can be characterized in terms of what minkowski cells they are allowed to use :    [ prop : fine ] a mixed subdivision @xmath62 is fine if and only if for every minkowski cell @xmath73 in @xmath62 , the @xmath71 s are all simplices and @xmath158 ( in other words , the @xmath71 s lie in independent affine subspaces ) .",
    "the `` if '' direction is straightforward : if all the cells are as claimed then no mixed cell can be properly contained in one of @xmath62 and , hence , @xmath62 is minimal . for the `` only if '' direction ,",
    "a direct proof can be given but it is simpler to use the cayley trick .",
    "the cayley trick implies that fine mixed subdivisions are those for which the associated polyhedral of @xmath20 is a triangulation . in other words , those that use only minkowski cells @xmath73",
    "whose associated cayley cells @xmath119 are simplices .",
    "this condition is easily seen to be equivalent to the one in the statement .",
    "we will refer to the special mixed cells described in proposition  [ prop : fine ] as _ fine mixed cells_.

    "if a cell has a full - dimensional summand then all the other summands are 0-dimensional ( points ) .",
    "hence , the information we are given is what maximal cells of @xmath62 form the subdivision @xmath150 , for every @xmath92 , except we are not told how to arrange them to subdivide @xmath22 .",
    "if we show how to do that , then theorem  [ thm : labels ] gives the rest .",
    "it is actually enough to find out , for every cell @xmath58 of @xmath62 , what is ( up to translation ) the @xmath92th summand @xmath71 of that cell .",
    "if we know this , we know how to write @xmath159 for each cell ( where the @xmath155 is the sum of all the other summands ) and we can scale down the @xmath155 components of all cells to recover ( in the limit ) the subdivision @xmath22 .",
    "suppose then that we have identified ( up to translation ) all the @xmath92-th summands of dimension greater than a certain @xmath152 .",
    "exactly as in theorem  [ thm : labels ] , it is then possible to propagate along @xmath62 all the @xmath152 dimensional faces of those summands , hence getting all the @xmath92-th summands of dimension @xmath152 .",

    "the figure shows all the triangulations of the 3-dimensional cube ( the cayley embedding of two equal squares ) , pictured as mixed subdivisions .",
    "only one representative modulo the symmetries of the square and modulo the exchange of the labels @xmath160 and @xmath39 is shown . in each picture , the two triangles labeled @xmath160 are the triangulation of the bottom square and the two triangles labeled @xmath39 are the triangulation of the top square of the cube .",
    "knowing that information is enough to recover the mixed subdivision labeling ( and hence , the corresponding triangulation of the 3-cube ) .",
    "it may be of interest also to define _ pure mixed subdivisions _ as those for which every minkowski cell @xmath73 satisfies @xmath161 .",

    "@xmath275    the numbers shown in table  [ table : numbers ] in the introduction were computed with an implementation of these recursive formulas in maple .",
    "the computation is clearly exponential in time , since we need to compute @xmath276 values of @xmath259 and @xmath260 for each @xmath10 . in practice , the computation of each value took about five times the previous one : 21 seconds for @xmath277 and 70 hours for @xmath278 . by corollary  [ coro : lozenge - mixed ] , multiplying the @xmath10th number by @xmath34 we get the number of triangulations of @xmath279 .",
    "a direct approach allowed jess de loera and jrg rambau  @xcite to compute these numbers of triangulations only up to @xmath202 and @xmath280 respectively .",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath281 is in @xmath282 :    * since a lozenge tiling can be specified by which of the three upward neighbors of each of the @xmath201 downward triangles forms a lozenge with it , @xmath283 * assume @xmath10 is a multiple of 3 .",
    "@xmath195 can be tiled into @xmath284 hexagons plus @xmath10 boundary trapezoids ( see figure  [ fig : hexagons ] ) , each of which can independently be refined in two ways .",

    "the property that the logarithm of the number of tilings is proportional to the area for dilations of a given shape is well - known in the context of usual lozenge tilings , as follows from the following result of cohn , kenyon and propp  @xcite ( they consider mostly the case of domino tilings , i.e. , perfect matchings in a sub - region of the square grid , but the case of lozenge tilings arises as a particular case in which certain edges are forbidden in the matching ) .",
    "let @xmath286 be a simply - connected region in the plane , and let @xmath287 be a sequence of lozenge - tileable ( in the standard sense ) simply - connected regions such that @xmath288 converges to @xmath286 .",
    "let @xmath289 be the boundary height function of the region @xmath290 ( defined below ) .",

    "the logarithm of the number of lozenge tilings of @xmath290 divided by the area of @xmath290 ( measured in lozenge tiles ) converges to a constant that depends only on @xmath286 and @xmath293 .",
    "constant is maximized if @xmath294 . in this case",
    "it equals @xmath295 here , @xmath30 is the lobachevsky function , defined as @xmath296    the constant in part ( 1 ) ( and its specific instance in part ( 2 ) ) is computed as an integral of the average ( in a well - defined sense ) extension of the boundary height function @xmath293 to the interior of @xmath286 .",
    "the boundary height function of a simply connected union @xmath297 of triangles of the regular triangular tiling is defined as follows : choose alternating signs for the six directions of edges in the tiling .",
    "starting at any particular boundary vertex , give height zero to that vertex and then propagate the height along the boundary cycle of @xmath297 , increasing or decreasing the height by one depending on the direction of the edge traversed .",

    "let @xmath191 be a tiling of @xmath195 into a triangular grid of about @xmath303 triangles of size about @xmath300 .    for each lozenge tiling of @xmath195",
    ", we cut @xmath195 without breaking tiles but otherwise as close as possible to the tiling @xmath191 .",
    "if a tile overlaps two cells of @xmath191 , we choose , for instance , to give that tile to the bottom of the two .",
    "the total perimeter of the cells in @xmath191 is clearly in @xmath304 .",
    "hence , the number of possible ways of cutting @xmath195 produced in this way is in @xmath305 . and will not affect the final asymptotics .",
    "our task is to bound the number of lozenge tilings compatible with a specific cutting .    for this",
    ", we consider independently the cells of @xmath191 that only contain lozenges and those that contain at least a triangle in the lozenge tiling .",
    "although this is not relevant for the asymptotics , observe that which cells contain triangles ( and how many of them ) is fixed by the cutting : for a specific cell , the number of triangles is the difference between upward and downward triangles of the triangular unit grid contained in it .    since at most @xmath10 cells contain triangles , we do not need to care much about their number of tilings . the easy argument that each downward triangle must be matched to",
    "one of at least three upward triangles shows that the number of tilings of each cell is at most @xmath306 .",
    "hence , the cells that contain triangles produce a factor of at most @xmath307 in the final number and can be neglected .    for the cells that are tiled only with lozenges ,",
    "we are in the situation of lemma  [ lemma : cokepr ] : the number of lozenge tilings of each is at most @xmath308 and the combined number is at most @xmath309",
    "develin and sturmfels have recently started developing the theory of polytopes in tropical space  @xcite .",
    "we here give a brief account of their main results , specially in their relations to subdivisions of the product of two simplices .",
    "the tropical projective space of dimension @xmath49 , denoted @xmath310 , is the quotient of @xmath311 by the equivalence relation @xmath312 , for every @xmath313 and every @xmath314 . by normalizing one of the coordinates ( say the first one ) to be equal to zero we can identify @xmath310 to @xmath315 .",
    "the tropical hyperplane defined by a vector @xmath316 is the set of points @xmath317 such that the minimum of the numbers @xmath318 is achieved twice .",
    "clearly , the hyperplanes defined by @xmath319 and by @xmath320 coincide , so we may say that a hyperplane is defined by a point @xmath321 .",
    "the hyperplane defined by @xmath322 is the set of points @xmath323 such that @xmath324 either lies in the boundary of the positive orthant or has minimum coordinate negative and repeated at least twice .",
    "said in a more compact ( and invariant ) form , it equals the @xmath325-skeleton of the normal fan of the simplex with vertices @xmath326 .",
    "the translation of this hyperplane by the vector @xmath327 gives the hyperplane defined by @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath328 is the hyperplane defined by a point @xmath329 , here we call @xmath330 the _ anti - hyperplane _ defined by @xmath324 . for the purposes of this paper , the following consequence of the results in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) can be taken as a definition of tropical convex hull :    [ prop : tropical ] let @xmath331 be a finite set of points in tropical @xmath49 space .",
    "then , its tropical convex hull @xmath332 equals the union of all bounded cells in the polyhedral arrangement of tropical anti - hyperplanes given by @xmath331 .",
    "the left part of figure  [ fig : tropical ] shows an example of this .",
    "the tropical convex hull of the five dots equals the shaded region , including its boundary and the horizontal segment that reaches to point number 5 .",
    "develin and sturmfels make no clear distinction between the tropical convex hull as a subset of @xmath310 and the polyhedral complex in the above statement , and use the term `` tropical polytope '' referring to both . here",
    "we will use `` tropical polytope '' referring to the region and call `` tropical order type '' of the point set the polyhedral complex .",
    "two point sets are _ combinatorially equivalent _ if they have the same bounded complex , in a labeled sense ( with the label of each cell indicating its relative position in each of the anti - hyperplanes .",
    "this is essentially what develin and sturmfels call the `` type '' of a cell ) .",
    "let @xmath333 and @xmath334 be two @xmath45 real matrices .",
    "then , the columns of @xmath333 and @xmath334 produce the same tropical order type if and only if they produce the same regular mixed subdivision of @xmath25 ( where the @xmath92th column specifies the heights to lift the vertices of the @xmath92th copy of @xmath23 ) .      figure  [ fig : tropical ] illustrates the correspondence between a tropical point configuration with 5 points in 2-space and a mixed subdivision of @xmath335 . as is easy to check , there is a 1-to-1 dimension ( and order ) reversing correspondence between the cells defined by the tropical point set and the cells in the mixed subdivision .",
    "unbounded cells in the tropical point set correspond to boundary cells in the mixed subdivision .",
    "corresponding cells are orthogonal to one another .",
    "actually , the link of a cell in the tropical point set is the normal fan of the corresponding cell in the mixed subdivision .",
    "as another example , figure  [ fig:35classes ] shows all the fine mixed subdivisions of @xmath336 , placed and numbered to exactly match the 35 types of `` tropical quadrangles '' as shown in figure 6 of  @xcite .",
    "( this list was originally computed by j. rambau  @xcite , and its order is the one given as output by topcom , that performs a `` breadth - first search '' on the graph of flips ) .",
    "we now use corollary  [ coro : tropical ] to give a bound on the number of regular subdivisions of @xmath24 . for this",
    ", we extend the tropical arrangement of @xmath10 anti - hyperplanes that defines @xmath332 to a ( usual ) affine arrangement @xmath337 of @xmath338 hyperplanes .",
    "indeed , the anti - hyperplane corresponding to a point @xmath339 is a @xmath340-dimensional polyhedral complex with @xmath341 maximal cells , lying respectively in the following hyperplanes : @xmath342 clearly , point sets with different tropical order type produce different ( labeled ) hyperplane arrangements .",
    "then :      we can assume that @xmath345 , because if this is not the case , the bound can be proved by direct inspection : if @xmath346 then the number of triangulations is @xmath34 and if @xmath347 then the number of triangulations is 108 by table [ table : numbers ] .",
    "we need to bound the number of different arrangements @xmath337 that can be produced for varying @xmath348 .",
    "two arrangements are `` equal '' if they have the same chirotope , that is to say , if every determinant of @xmath54 of the @xmath349 hyperplanes has the same sign in the two arrangements .    from the definition of the hyperplanes in equation ( [ eqn : hyperplanes ] )",
    "it is clear that each of the determinants that define the chirotope of @xmath337 is a linear functional on the @xmath350 variables @xmath351 .",
    "since the tropical order type is invariant under addition of a constant to a row or column of the matrix @xmath351 , we can assume @xmath352 for every @xmath92 and @xmath213 , leaving only @xmath353 variables .",
    "hence , the order type of @xmath337 appears represented as a cell in a huge linear hyperplane arrangement of @xmath354 hyperplanes in @xmath355 .",
    "this gives the statement , since the number of cells in an arrangement of @xmath356 hyperplanes in @xmath357 is maximal for simple arrangements , in which case it equals @xmath358 in the first inequality we assume that @xmath359 , which always happens for @xmath360 and @xmath361 ; in the last inequality we have used our assumption that @xmath362 .    observe that our bound is quite rough not only because different arrangements @xmath337 may represent the same tropical order type , but also because the sign of many of the @xmath363 determinants considered in the proof is constant ( independent of the @xmath364 ) .",
    "we believe the actual number of regular subdivisions to be in @xmath365 . anyway , for fixed @xmath54 our bound gives the exact asymptotic behavior of the number of regular subdivisions :        for all subdivisions , theorem  [ thm : asymptotics ] gives the case @xmath26 and the others follow immediately : any subdivision of a particular @xmath371 face of @xmath372 can be extended to the whole polytope .",
