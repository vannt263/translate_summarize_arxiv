    "nonclassical states of light represent a resource for high - precision measurements .",
    "they are generally produced in active optical media , which couple one or more modes of the field through the nonlinear susceptibility of the matter .",
    "in particular , parametric processes in second order @xmath0 media correspond to gaussian operations and are used to generate squeezing , hereafter _",
    "gaussian _ squeezing , and entanglement .",
    "gaussian squeezing is the basic ingredient of quantum enhanced interferometry @xcite and found several applications in quantum metrology and communication @xcite .",
    "in addition , gaussian squeezing is the key resource to achieve precise estimation of unitary @xcite and non unitary parameters @xcite . in turn",
    ", squeezed vacuum state has been addressed as a universal optimal probe @xcite within the class of gaussian states .    on the other hand",
    ", the kerr effect taking place in third - order nonlinear @xmath1 media leads to a non gaussian operation , and has been suggested to realize quantum nondemolition measurements @xcite , and to generate quantum superpositions @xcite as well as squeezing @xcite and entanglement @xcite .",
    "a well known example of kerr media are optical fibers where , however , nonlinearities are very small and accompanied by other unwanted effects .",
    "larger kerr nonlinearities have been observed with electro- magnetically induced transparency @xcite and with bose einstein condensates @xcite and cold atoms @xcite .",
    "recently , nonlinearities on 9 orders of magnitude higher than natural kerr interactions have been proposed by using the purcell effect @xcite , rydberg atoms @xcite , interaction of a cavity mode with atoms @xcite and nanomechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "notice that the dynamics in a kerr medium may be accurately described in terms of the wigner function in the phase - space @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider generic gaussian states undergoing self - kerr interaction and investigate their use in estimation of displacement and squeezing parameters . indeed ,",
    "displacement and squeezing are basic gaussian operations in continuous variable systems and represent building blocks to manipulate gaussian states for quantum information processing .",
    "besides , they represent the ultimate description of interferometric interaction . as a consequence , their characterization , _",
    "i.e _ the optimal estimation of displacement and squeezing parameters has been widely investigated @xcite by using different tools from quantum estimation theory ( qet ) @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to assess kerr interaction and the resulting non - gaussianity ( nong ) as a resource for parameter estimation , and to this aim we consider two different situations with different physical constraints .",
    "on the one hand we study schemes where we fix the overall energy available to the probe , without posing any constraint on the available gaussian squeezing ; this will be referred to as the fixed energy case . on the other hand",
    ", we will analyze the more realistic case where the amount of gaussian squeezing is fixed , or even absent , and refer to this case as the fixed squeezing case .",
    "as we will see , at fixed energy gaussian squeezing still represents the optimal resource for parameter estimation . on the other hand ,",
    "when the amount of gaussian squeezing is fixed then kerr interaction turns out to be useful to improve estimation , especially when the probe states have a large number of _ non squeezing _ photons , i.e large amplitude . in this case precision obtained by gaussian states",
    "is achieved or enhanced .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : qet ] we review few basic ingredients of local quantum estimation theory and illustrate the content of the quantum cramer - rao bound . in sec , [ s : displa ] we analyze the use of kerr interaction to improve estimation of the displacement amplitude , whereas in sec .",
    "[ s : squeeze ] we focus on squeezing estimation .",
    "[ s : outro ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "let us start by reviewing some basic concepts of local quantum estimation theory : when a physical parameter is not directly accessible one has to resort to indirect measurements , i.e. , measuring an observable somehow related to the quantity of interest and estimate its value from the experimental sample .",
    "let us denote by @xmath2 the quantity of interest , @xmath3 the measured observable , and @xmath4 the observed sample .",
    "the _ estimation problem _ amounts to find an estimator , that is a map @xmath5 from the set of the outcomes to the space of parameters .",
    "classically , optimal estimators are those saturating the cramer - rao inequality @xmath6^{-1}$ ] , which bounds from below the variance @xmath7-e [ \\hat{\\lambda}]^2 $ ] of any unbiased estimator of the parameter @xmath2 . in the cramer - rao inequality , @xmath8 is the number of measurements and @xmath9 is the so - called fisher information ( fi ) @xmath10 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath11 is the conditional probability of obtaining the value @xmath12 when the parameter has the value @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum analog of the cramer - rao bound is obtained starting from the born rule @xmath13 $ ] where @xmath14 is the probability operator - valued measure ( povm ) describing the measurement and @xmath15 the density operator , labeled by the parameter of interest . in order to evaluate the ultimate bounds to precision one",
    "introduces the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) @xmath16 as the operator satisfying @xmath17 and prove that the fi is upper bounded by the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) @xcite @xmath18 .",
    "$ ] in turn , the ultimate limit to precision is given by the quantum cramer - rao bound @xmath19^{-1}$ ] .",
    "let us consider the case where the parameter of interest is the shift imposed by a unitary evolution @xmath20 to a given initial pure state @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the corresponding hermitian generator .",
    "the family of states we are dealing with is given by @xmath23 , and since for pure states @xmath24 , one has @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 \\notag \\\\",
    "h(\\lambda ) & = 4 \\left [ { \\langle \\partial_\\lambda\\psi_\\lambda \\vert \\partial_\\lambda \\psi_\\lambda \\rangle } + ( { \\langle \\partial_\\lambda\\psi_\\lambda \\vert \\psi_\\lambda \\rangle})^2\\right ] \\notag\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after some algebra one sees that the qfi turns out to be proportional to the fluctuations of the generator on the probe state , @xmath27 , and thus it is independent on the value of @xmath2 . the above equation , together with the cramer - rao bound , expresses the ultimate quantum lower bound on the precision achievable by using a given probe @xmath21 and any estimation procedure , i.e. without making reference to any specific detection scheme . in the following",
    "we will exploit the above tools to assess and compare the use of gaussian states and kerr modified gaussian states in the estimation of displacement and squeezing parameters .",
    "more specifically , we evaluate the qfi as a function of the involved parameters and analyze its behaviour in different relevant regimes .",
    "let us first consider the estimation of displacement , i.e. of the real parameter @xmath28 imposed by the unitary @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the corresponding generator . for a generic pure gaussian probe , i.e. a displaced squeezed state of the form @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) where @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the qfi , i.e. the fluctuations of the generator , may be evaluated by normal ordering for creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "one obtains @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the corresponding squeezing fraction ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "as expected for a unitary family the qfi does not depend on the value of the parameter .",
    "besides , the qfi depends only on the squeezing energy @xmath39 , and thus increasing the amplitude energy @xmath40 , does not lead to any enhancement of precision . therefore , at fixed energy , the maximum qfi @xmath41 is achieved for @xmath42 , _",
    "i.e. _ for squeezed vacuum . in the opposite limit ( @xmath43 ) ,",
    "_ i.e. _ for coherent states , the qfi is constant : @xmath44 .",
    "let us consider now a generic gaussian state that undergoes kerr interaction @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the qfi for this class of states can be evaluated numerically upon varying the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we found that at fixed energy , the optimal probe state is still the squeezed vacuum state .",
    "the optimal qfi is a monotonous decreasing function of @xmath47 and the kerr dynamics does not improve estimation precision .",
    "in other words , at fixed energy , squeezed vacuum state is the best probe not only among the class of gaussian states , but also maximizing the qfi over the wider class of states kerr perturbed gaussian states .",
    "let us now address estimation of displacement in the more realistic configuration , where the amount of gaussian squeezing is fixed or absent",

    "[ f : squeezedfixedsq ] the qfi increases with @xmath54 and overtake quite rapidly the values of qfi of the corresponding gaussian state .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , kerr interaction induces a nongaussian operation .",
    "a question thus arises on whether there is a connection between the amount of nong of the probe and the precision of estimation . in other words , whether or not nong may be used as an overall indicator of precision enhancement due to kerr interaction .",
    "the answer to this question amounts to investigate the behavior of the qfi as a function of a nong measure .",
    "different measures of nong for a quantum state have been recently introduced @xcite and here we consider the entropic measure @xcite @xmath81=s(\\tau ) - s(\\varrho)$ ] where @xmath82 is the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath83 , and @xmath84 denotes the gaussian states with the same covariance matrix of the state @xmath83 under investigation .",
    "since both , nong for kerr modified coherent states and the corresponding qfi are increasing functions of the number of photons , we consider a _ normalized _ nong measure @xmath85= \\delta[\\varrho]/ \\delta_m ( n_\\alpha)$ ] , obtained as the ratio between @xmath81 $ ] and the maximum nong @xmath86 achievable with the same number of photons .",

    "on the other hand , if we fix one of the two parameters ( @xmath47 or @xmath92 ) and vary the other one , we observe a monotonous behavior .",
    "in other words nong is quantitatively related to the increase in qfi and thus represents a good indicator to assess kerr interaction in quantum estimation .",
    "one may also ask whether the enhancement in precision obtained with kerr interaction may be ascribed to the squeezing effect occurring in kerr evolution at small time / nonlinearity and/or small number of photons . for coherent input ,",
    "this is definitely not the case , as it can easily checked by noting that improvement in precision occurs for @xmath95 i.e. when the state is no longer squeezed ( see @xcite for a phase space picture of kerr evolution for input coherent states ) . moreover ,",
    "when we consider a kerr perturbed squeezed state as input , the qfi for displacement estimation is not monotone in the region where one may expect a further squeezing effect or at least that the initial squeezing is conserved .",
    "also in this case , enhancement in precision is observed for increasing amplitude photons or kerr nonlinearity , when the quantum state is no longer squeezed . at the same time",
    ", improvement is not due to the evolution towards cat states , since they are achieved by kerr interaction only for very high nonlinearities and they present a different scaling in precision @xcite .",
    "the most intuitive picture one may draw is that the involved structure of the wigner function leads to its spread over the phase - space and consequently to a smaller overlap when displaced ( squeezed ) .",
    "one should also notice that , since the phase of the coherent input signal is optimized for each pair of values of the coupling and the amplitude , a simple picture in terms of wigner evolution may be even confusing rather than help intuition .",
    "for these reasons we consider nong as a suitable quantity to summarize the improvement in the estimation precision for kerr perturbed gaussian states .",
    "in conclusion , we have addressed the use of kerr interaction to improve estimation of displacement and squeezing parameters and analyzed in details the behavior of the quantum fisher information as a function of probe and interaction parameters .",
    "we found that at fixed energy , with no constraint on the available gaussian squeezing , kerr dynamics is not useful and performances of gaussian states are superior . on the other hand , in the more realistic case where the amount of gaussian squeezing is fixed , or absent ,",
    "then kerr interaction improves estimation , especially for probe states with large amplitude",
    ".    it should be noticed that gaussian squeezing in @xmath0 media is obtained by parametric processes and the amount of squeezing linearly increases with the pump intensity . on the other hand , in @xmath1 media ,",
    "the energy needed to obtain significant nonlinear effects is provided by the signal itself .",
    "overall , our results indicate that precision achievable with current technology gaussian squeezing may be attained and surpassed for realistic values of the kerr coupling and large enough signal amplitude .",
    "we also found that precision improvement is quantitatively related with the amount of nongaussianity induced by kerr interaction , and thus conclude that kerr nongaussianity is a resource , achievable with current technology , for high - precision measurements .",
    "we foresee a possible widespread use as a characterization tools in emerging quantum technologies like quantum communication and metrology .",

    "<S> we address quantum estimation of displacement and squeezing parameters by the class of probes made of gaussian states undergoing kerr interaction . </S>",
    "<S> if we fix the overall energy available to the probe , without posing any constraint on the available gaussian squeezing , then gaussian squeezing represents the optimal resource for parameter estimation . on the other hand , in the more realistic case where the amount of gaussian squeezing is fixed , or even absent </S>",
    "<S> , then kerr interaction turns out to be useful to improve estimation , especially for probe states with large amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that precision achievable with current technology gaussian squeezing may be attained and surpassed for realistic values of the kerr coupling . </S>"
