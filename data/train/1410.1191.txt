    "a classic element of polymer solution physics , the flory - huggins ( fh ) model,@xcite @xmath8 describes the free energy of mixing of @xmath9 moles of polymer liquid with @xmath10 moles of the water solvent ; @xmath11 , @xmath0 is the solvent volume fraction , @xmath12 ( the ratio of the molar volumes of the pure liquids ) is the operational polymerization index , and @xmath13 is the fh interaction coefficient . here",
    "we study the concentration dependence of @xmath13 , important for mixing the dissimilar liquids of water and chain molecules that have a non - trivial aqueous solubility .",
    "the fh model is routinely adopted for discussion of aqueous solutions of chain molecules of sub - polymeric length.@xcite the study below highlights direct access to the osmotic pressures of these solutions , and thus can address long - standing research on biophysical hydration forces.@xcite    though the traditional statistical mechanical calculation@xcite that arrives at eq .   is not compelling for aqueous materials , the fh model captures two dominating points .",
    "firstly , it identifies the volume fraction @xmath0 as the preferred concentration variable , associated with the physical assumption that the excess volume of mixing vanishes .",
    "this step partially avoids difficult statistical mechanical packing problems.@xcite secondly , eq .",
    "captures the reduction of the chain molecule ideal entropy by the factor @xmath14 .",
    "the physical identification of the polymerization index @xmath15 as @xmath16 as thermodynamically consistent as noted below , but is a crude description of the molecular structure of polymers . with these points",
    "recognized , however , the interaction contribution of eq .",
    "can be regarded as an interpolation between the ends @xmath17 of the composition range .",
    "the simplest expectation @xcite for the interaction parameter is @xmath18 where the parameters @xmath19 gauge the strength of dispersion interactions in van der waals models of liquids.@xcite that this justification is implausible for aqueous solutions@xcite underscores the lack of a basic understanding of @xmath20 for aqueous solutions .",
    "the simple temperature dependence of eq .   is a reasonable starting point , but aqueous solutions exhibit alternative temperature dependences of specific interest , hydrophobic effects.@xcite more troublesome , eq .   does not depend on concentration , though experiments on the peg / water system @xcite show substantial concentration dependence . beyond that difficulty ,",
    "those results exhibit a temperature trend opposite to eq .  , _",
    "i.e. , _ stronger interactions at higher @xmath6  consistent with the classic folklore of hydrophobic effects.@xcite in contrast , when the solvent is methanol @xcite the observed concentration dependence is less strong , though non - trivial and trending with concentration in the opposite direction from the aqueous solution results .",
    "the temperature dependences for the methanol case is qualitatively consistent with the simple expectation of eq .  .",
    "in further contrast , with ethanol as solvent @xcite the observed concentration dependence is distinctly modest .",
    "these puzzles may be addressed by analyzing the chemical potential of the water,@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 the interaction ( or _ excess _ ) contribution to the chemical potential of the water , referenced to the pure liquid value .",
    "the osmotic pressure @xmath23 , @xcite @xmath24 provides further perspective on @xmath25 . beyond assuming that the excess volume of mixing vanishes , eq .   makes the standard approximation that the solvent is incompressible.@xcite to justify the identification @xmath26 noted above , we utilize eq .  , and expand through @xmath27 to obtain @xmath28 with @xmath29 thus the osmotic second virial coefficient .",
    "we adopt here the short - hand notation @xmath30 the identification of @xmath15 in the contribution @xmath31 thus leads to the proper behavior in the ideal solution limit .",
    ".,width=307 ]    as suggested above , the intent of the fh model is that a concentration - independent @xmath13 should describe the effects of enthalpic interactions .",
    "our less - committal analysis acquires practical significance from recent development of molecular quasi - chemical theory for the excess chemical potential of the water in aqueous solutions.@xcite the central result @xmath32 is a physical description in terms of packing , outer - shell and chemical contributions , a comprehensive extension of a van  der  waals picture.@xcite the packing contribution is obtained from the observed probability @xmath33 for successful random insertion of a spherical cavity of radius @xmath34 into the simulation cell .",
    "similarly , the chemical contribution is defined with the probability @xmath35 that a water molecule in the system has zero neighbors within the radius @xmath34 of its o atom .",
    "the outer - shell contribution is a partition function involving the binding energy @xmath36 , conditional on the inner - shell being empty .",
    "the condition permits a gaussian statistical approximation , @xmath37 involving the mean and variance of binding energies of molecules that have zero neighbors within radius @xmath34 .    ' indicates the difference from the pure solvent value , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath38 = @xmath39 - @xmath40 .",
    "a water molecule loses stabilizing outer - shell interactions through intermediate concentrations , and then regains favorable outer - shell contributions on the solvent - poor side of the concentration range .",
    "the dashed - blue curve shows the combined packing and chemical contributions.,width=307 ]    with this background , we evaluate @xmath41 representing then @xmath42 and integrating , with @xmath43 at @xmath44 , we obtain @xmath45",
    "we thus analyze @xmath46 for aqueous solutions for methyl - capped peo oligomers @xcite ch@xmath2(ch@xmath3-o - ch@xmath3)@xmath47ch@xmath2 on the basis of accessible molecular simulation data.@xcite for this mixture we find @xmath15 = 27.6 , with the excess volumes of mixing similar to experimental results for similarly sized peg 400:@xcite negative and small , though slightly larger than the comparable experimental case .",
    "the dielectric constant of these solution varies linearly with solvent volume fraction @xmath0 .",
    "is correct for any physical @xmath34 , @xcite and we choose @xmath48  nm as a balance between statistical and systematic accuracy",
    ". the gaussian approximation will be more accurate for larger @xmath34 .",
    "but the data set satisfying the condition @xmath49 gets smaller and the statistical accuracy is degraded with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "the latter point becomes more serious at lower water concentrations because fewer water molecules are present .",
    "nevertheless , only the difference eq .",
    "is required , so systematic errors should be balanced to some extent .",
    ".   produces a structured dependence on @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : muxsv3 ] ) . extracting the individual quasi - chemical theory contributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : muxspiecesv1 ] ) shows that the distinctive variation with @xmath0 is due to the outer - shell ( long - ranged ) contributions : a water molecule looses stabilizing outer - shell interaction partners through intermediate concentrations , then regains favorable free energies through the fluctuation contribution of the gaussian formula ( eq .  ) .",
    "these countervailing trends are not synchronous , so the net result is a non - monotonic function of @xmath0 .    .",

    "the osmotic second virial coefficient is positive.,width=307 ]    the @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dgmixv3 ] ) describes separation of a water - poor solution from a water - rich phase . the osmotic pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : osmomicv5 ] ) further characterizes the transition . to confirm the predicted phase separation , we simulated coexistence of water - rich and water - poor solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dgmixv3 ] ) .",
    "the two fluids did indeed coexist stably on the simulation time scale of 20  ns , though the dynamics of the water - poor solution are distinctly sluggish : the self - diffusion coefficient of the water in the water - poor phase is about a 1/4th of that in the water - rich phase .",
    "in assessing the coexisting water - poor phase , we note that these chains are short and the capping groups play a significant role .",
    "comparable molecular - weight peo chains with one hydroxyl and one methoxy termination are pastes at low water content .",
    "methyoxy terminated peo chains as small as two - times larger than the present case form crystals with li electrolytes at these temperatures.@xcite the difference between the predicted coexistence points and the compositions exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgmixv3 ] might be due to the assumption of ideal volumes of mixing .",
    "though the excess volumes are small , they are largest in the interesting intermediate concentration @xmath50 region .",
    "this should receive further study .",
    "the observations here should help in formulating a defensible molecular theory of peo ( aq ) phase transitions .",
    "the interesting @xmath1 concentration dependence derives from long - ranged interactions .",
    "this analysis provides straightforward predictions of osmotic pressures , not requiring detailed analysis of 2-body ( or successive few - body ) contributions .",
    "this realization should help in studies of osmotic stress.@xcite",
    "the financial support of the gulf of mexico research initiative ( consortium for ocean leadership grant sa 12 - 05/gomri-002 ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we thank s. j. paddison for helpful conversations .",
    "parallel tempering simulations , implemented@xcite within gromacs 4.5.3,@xcite were used to enhance the sampling at the @xmath6 = 300  k temperature of interest .",
    "parallel tempering swaps were attempted at a rate of 100/ns , which resulted in a success rates of 15 - 30% .",
    "the chain molecules were represented by the opls - aa force field,@xcite and the spc / e model was used for water.@xcite long - range electrostatic interactions were treated in standard periodic boundary conditions using the particle mesh ewald method with a cutoff of 0.9  nm .",
    "the nos - hoover thermostat maintained the constant temperature and chemical bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained by the lincs algorithm .",
    "after energy minimization and density equilibration at 300.4 k and @xmath7 = 1  atm , 40 replicas spanning 256 - 450 k , each at the same volume , were simulated for 10 ns .",
    "the pure liquid molar volumes were @xmath51 = 0.0178  dm@xmath52/mole , @xmath53 = 0.490  dm@xmath52/mole , so @xmath15 = 27.6 .",
    "configurations of the @xmath6 = 300.4  k replica were sampled every 0.5 ps for subsequent analysis .",
    "the packing , outer - shell and chemical terms were calculated separately using the replica at 300.4 k. 30,000 uniformly spaced trial insertions were used to estimate the packing term .",
