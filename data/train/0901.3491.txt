    "the last remaining remnant of the big bang , which is composed of a _ known _ particle is the cosmic neutrino background ( cnb ) .",
    "it decouples from thermal equilibrium at @xmath1 mev .",
    "it gives information about the universe at a time significantly before the decoupling of photons at @xmath2 ev .",
    "the processes responsible for their creation and decoupling are well understood nuclear physics .",
    "today these neutrinos are expected to be extremely cold ( @xmath3 ) . as such , they are extremely difficult to detect due to the fact that weak interaction cross sections scale as @xmath4 .",
    "they have a density of @xmath5 per species of neutrino and anti - neutrino , corresponding to a luminosity @xmath6 if the neutrinos were massless .",
    "@xcite these numbers rely on a specific cosmological model which could be substantially modified , if neutrinos cluster gravitationally , or if they have nontrivial dynamics after freeze - out .",
    "@xcite it has also recently been shown that these neutrinos are a quantum liquid , and their fluctuations have the quantum numbers of a graviton , opening the prospect that measurements of relic neutrinos could then be compared with gravitational constants .",
    "@xcite nuclei that undergo @xmath7-decay are a precise and specific laboratory to look for the cnb",
    ". there exists a vast array of nuclei that can emit or absorb neutrinos at a wide range of energies .",
    "a signal seen using @xmath7-decaying nuclei constitutes a specific test because they are already known to emit or absorb lepton number in specific ways .",
    "all other proposals could not in principle tell if the effect was due to an object with lepton number .",
    "@xcite high - energy neutrinos ( e.g. z - burst ) can be absorbed by things which do not carry lepton number , and anomalous forces could have a variety of sources that have nothing to do with lepton number ( for instance , a dark matter wind ) .",
    "finally the effects of neutrinos on the cmb can not be disentangled from other relativistic species that are not be fermionic or do not carry lepton number .",
    "rates using decaying nuclei are in principle much higher than other proposals such as coherent scattering , because the energy for the observation is coming from nuclear mass differences , and not from the neutrinos themselves .",
    "the energy @xmath8 in nuclear transitions is @xmath9 .",
    "giving the cnb neutrinos this energy in a coherent experiment would require moving with a velocity corresponding to a boost factor @xmath10 . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath11 at the lhc with protons is about 15000 , or 5500 with lead .",
    "there are two ways to see an effect of the neutrino background using a beta - decaying nucleus : add a neutrino to it or remove a neutrino from it .",
    "both were suggested by weinberg in 1962 .",
    "@xcite    adding a neutrino to the background is suppressed for momenta which are already occupied by the cnb thermal distribution , due to the fact that neutrinos are fermions and their chemical potential and average energy are similar .",
    "this is an @xmath12 effect , if one can create neutrinos having the correct energy .    removing a neutrino from the cnb using nuclei",
    "is known as neutrino capture ( @xmath13c ) .",
    "capture of reactor neutrinos is the original mode used to discover the neutrino .",
    "recently there has been a surge of interest in this mode for detecting the cnb using @xmath7-decaying nuclei , which can have zero threshold.@xcite",
    "the cnb is a thermal distribution in a particular frame @xmath14 which we assume to be coincident with the dipole from the cosmic microwave background , which points in the direction @xmath15 in galactic coordinates , with velocity @xmath16 km / s .",
    "its thermal distribution is then @xmath17^{-1 }      \\label{eq : f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for each species of neutrino and anti - neutrino @xmath18 , having mass @xmath19 and chemical potential @xmath20 and four - momentum @xmath21 in the cosmic rest frame @xmath22 and this reduces to the usual non - relativistic fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the relativistic chemical potential is the fermi energy at zero temperature , @xmath23 , and the nominal fermi momentum predicted by the standard cosmological model is @xmath24{3 \\pi^2 \\rho_\\nu } = \\sqrt[3]{3 \\pi^2 \\rho_{\\overline{\\nu } } } = 3.6\\times 10^{-5}$ ] ev , where @xmath25 is the number density per flavor .",
    "we will refer to this as the `` standard '' chemical potential .            a process which emits neutrinos has a suppression @xmath26 $ ] due to pauli blocking from this thermal distribution .",
    "this is independent of whether the neutrinos are described as a localized classical gas having small uncertainty @xmath27 or a quantum liquid @xmath28 for number density @xmath29 . for a beta decay",
    "this is @xmath30 dps\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the differential phase space , @xmath32 is the eigenvector component of neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath18 in the electron neutrino direction , @xmath33 is the matrix element of the emission of an electron - type neutrino with mass @xmath19 , and one sums over the mass eigenstates since final state emitted particles must be in a mass eigenstate .",
    "this suppression factor is experimentally indistinguishable from @xmath34 except in a region in which the emitted neutrino has the same energy as the cnb .",
    "we plot the suppression factor , summed over flavors in fig.[fig : fdsmasses ]    the matrix element for the beta decay is @xmath35      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the vector and axial vector weak charges of the atom . for @xmath38=neutron , @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix element also reaches a minimum @xmath40 at @xmath41=0 , so the event rate at @xmath42 is zero .",
    "because of this , the minimum in fig.[fig : fdsmasses ] is deceptive .",
    "the differential event rate including the matrix element is plotted in fig.[fig : decrate ] for tritium , assuming a standard chemical potential .    to place a neutrino into the background with significant suppression , we need that the invariant @xmath43 .",
    "since our velocity with respect to the cosmic rest frame is small ( @xmath44 ) , one can ignore our velocity and pretend we can do the experiment in the cosmic rest frame .    in a normal @xmath45 decay",
    "an atom @xmath38 decays to atom @xmath46 by emitting an electron or positron and an anti - neutrino or neutrino .",
    "if one can precisely measure the momenta of @xmath38 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , one can solve for the neutrino momenta .",
    "this requires momentum resolution on each of order @xmath48 .",
    "if the initial state @xmath38 is at rest , this corresponds to a temperature @xmath49 stated another way , the de broglie wavelength of the neutrinos is 1.2 mm . since the uncertainty on momentum scales with momentum",
    ", the initial state must have a similar de broglie wavelength .",
    "modern atomic bose - einstein condensate and degenerate fermi gas experiments using laser and evaporative cooling routinely reach @xmath50 k today . another promising technology to get to these precisions in the initial state is `` crystallized beams '' .",
    "@xcite    the final state of the decay is the atom @xmath46 almost exactly back - to - back with the electron or positron .",
    "similarly these final state particles must be measured with a precision @xmath51 where in the last term we assume @xmath52 .",
    "one might wonder if the effect shown here can impact experiments such as katrin which attempt to measure the neutrino mass using the highest energy electrons in a beta decay .",
    "katrin attempts to measure mass due to the change in slope and rate suppression near the endpoint , and they do not have the resolution to see the actual endpoint itself .",
    "their resolution is approximately @xmath53 ev . the effects here only effect the highest ( electron ) energy bin , and reduce the number of events there by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total decays they see .",
    "existing experiments simply do not have the rate for this effect to be a concern .",
