    "originally devised to describe autocatalytic chemical reactions @xcite and fish harvests in the adriatic @xcite , the classic lotka  volterra coupled set of ordinary differential equations represents a central paradigm for the emergence of species coexistence and periodic oscillations in nonlinear systems with competing constituents .",
    "it thus features prominently in textbooks on nonlinear dynamics @xcite , ecology @xcite , population dynamics @xcite , and mathematical biology @xcite , although this _ deterministic _ rate equation system is known to be mathematically unstable against modifications , spatial variations , and stochasticity , and therefore also unlikely to be biologically relevant @xcite .    neither criticism however pertains to _ stochastic _ spatial predator  prey models @xcite , for which the mean - field approximation recovers the original lotka  volterra differential equations . in stark contrast with the deterministic lotka ",
    "volterra rate equations , such stochastic lattice predator  prey models in fact display remarkably robust features ( for a recent overview , see @xcite ) : sufficiently deep in the species coexistence phase , the population densities oscillate in an irregular manner , however with characteristic periods and amplitudes that vanish in the thermodynamic limit @xcite ; these erratic oscillations are induced by recurrent activity waves that initially form concentric rings , and upon merging produce complex spatiotemporal structures @xcite .    these quite generic characteristics are found in computer simulations of several distinct model variants , differing in the precise microscopic algorithmic setups such as the number of possible states per lattice site and detailed implementations of the reaction scheme , e.g. , parallel vs. sequential updates , etc . perhaps suprisingly this includes even long - range processes @xcite , generalizations to ` smart ' predators and prey who respectively follow / evade the other species @xcite , and a variation where the predation reaction is split up into two separate and independent processes @xcite . indeed , already a zero - dimensional stochastic predator ",
    "prey model exhibits prominent population oscillations driven by the inevitable internal reaction noise @xcite ; such finite - size fluctuations also drastically affect the properties of , e.g. , the three - species cyclic lotka  volterra model @xcite .    largely for computational simplicity , such lattice models for reacting particle systems typically operate with constraints on the possible site occupation numbers , usually allowing only at most one particle per site ; but four - state predator  prey systems which permit both a single predator and prey per site have been studied too @xcite . biologically and ecologically , such site occupation number restrictions may be interpreted as originating in _ local _ limitations on resources for either species . on the mean - field description level , they are represented by finite carrying capacities in the rate equations that prevent unbounded ( malthusian ) species growth ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "already on this rate equation level , such constraints have a dramatic effect : they lead to the emergence of an extinction threshold for the predator population . in the stochastic spatial system ( and in the thermodynamic limit ) , predator extinction is governed by a continuous active - to - absorbing phase transition . as one would expect @xcite , the associated critical exponents are those of directed percolation @xcite ; an analytic argument that demonstrates this assertion , based on a field theory representation of the underlying stochastic processes ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) is presented in @xcite .",
    "presumably already a lattice representation should be viewed as a mesoscopic representation of the chemical or biological system under consideration ; naturally therefore the question arises which influence the implicit coarse - graining scale might have on the system s properties . also , it is of interest to study a stochastic spatial system most closely related to the original lotka  volterra model , i.e. , without any limits on the carrying capacities ( specifically for the prey ) . in this work ,",
    "we investigate such an unconstrained lattice predator  prey model .",
    "as suggested by the corresponding mean - field theory , we do not encounter predator extinction , but both species always coexist ( within the typical time scales of our simulation runs ) .",
    "this appears to be true even in one dimension .",
    "the strictly periodic population oscillations , which are moreover determined by the initial configuration , of the deterministic rate equations are replaced with erratic , transient oscillations largely determined by the intrinsic rates , and with frequencies renormalized by the fluctuations .",
    "if the reaction rates are high , and the processes effectively rendered more local , we find the oscillatory behaviour to cease . as in the lattice models with site occupation number restrictions , persistent complex spatio - temporal structures form , but",
    "the activity fronts are generally more diffuse .    in the following section , we briefly review the results of the mean - field rate equation approximation for lotka  volterra type predator - prey models with and without limiting carrying capacities .",
    "next we describe the alterations in the monte carlo algorithm and data structure that are required if we wish to allow arbitrarily many occupants per lattice site , before we present our simulation results .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our findings in the concluding section .",
    "we wish to consider a two - species system of diffusing particles or population members subject to the following reactions : @xmath0 the ` predators ' @xmath1 die spontaneously at rate @xmath2 , whereas the ` prey ' @xmath3 proliferate with rate @xmath4 . in the absence of the binary ` predation '",
    "interaction with rate @xmath5 , the uncoupled first - order processes would naturally lead to predator extinction @xmath6 , and malthusian prey population explosion @xmath7 . here ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively denote the @xmath1/@xmath3 concentrations or predator / prey population densities .",
    "the second reaction in the above scheme induces species coexistence @xcite .",
    "all three reactions as well as nearest ",
    "neighbour hopping are to be interpreted as _",
    "stochastic _ processes , and the spatial distribution of reactants as well as reaction - induced correlations turn out to be relevant for a quantitative characterization of the kinetics of this system .",
    "nevertheless , straightforward mean - field theory provides relevant insight into some basic properties of the system , and are reflected in the full stochastic simulation results to be discussed in section  4 below .",
    "thus let us first ignore spatial variations , fluctuations and correlations , which leads to the corresponding _ mean - field _",
    "rate equations for the average concentrations : @xmath10 setting the time derivatives to zero yields three stationary states @xmath11 : ( i ) the absorbing state with total population extinction @xmath12 , which is obviously linearly unstable ( if @xmath4 ) ; ( ii ) predator extinction and prey explosion @xmath13 , which for @xmath14 is also linearly unstable ( and represents an absorbing state for the predators ) ; and ( iii ) species coexistence @xmath15 .",
    "this fixed point is however only marginally stable , for the eigenvalues of the jacobian stability matrix are purely imaginary , @xmath16 . indeed , linearizing near @xmath17 results in the coupled differential equations @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which are readily solved by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this suggests periodic oscillations about the center fixed point @xmath17 with frequency @xmath22 . indeed , solving for the phase space trajectories yields @xmath23 / [ b \\ , ( \\sigma - \\lambda \\ , a)]$ ] , with a first integral ( equal to the negative expression of the associated lyapunov function for the rate equations with growth - limiting term , see below ) @xmath24 - \\sigma \\ln a(t ) -",

    "notice however that there is no physical symmetry behind the conservation law ; @xmath28 is a mere mathematical property of the coupled mean - field rate equations , and will not hold for the underlying stochastic process .",
    "these regular population oscillations fixed by the initial state are clearly not realistic in a biological setting .",

    ". we remark in parentheses that the rate equations and may be derived in a systematic manner from the underlying stochastic master equation for the stochastic processes with site occupation numbers restricted to @xmath31 or @xmath32 for either species @xcite .    the non - trivial stationary states in the ensuing restricted lotka ",
    "volterra model become modified to ( ii ) predator extinction and prey saturation @xmath33 , linearly stable for @xmath34 ; and ( iii ) species coexistence @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which requires efficient predation , @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the coexistence fixed point is always linearly stable , since the associated eigenvalues of the jacobian , @xmath39 $ ] , have a negative real part indicating exponential approach to @xmath35 . for @xmath40 , or @xmath41 ,",
    "these eigenvalues are real , and the fixed point can be characterized as a stable node . on the other hand , if @xmath42 or @xmath43 , i.e. , deep in the coexistence phase , @xmath44 turn into a complex conjugate pair , and @xmath35 becomes a stable spiral singularity which is approached in a damped oscillatory manner .",
    "actually , going beyond the linear analysis , the existence of the lyapunov function @xmath45 $ ] for the rate equations and implies the global stability of the reactive fixed point @xmath35 @xcite .    thus already within the mean - field approximation a finite prey carrying capacity @xmath46 , which can be viewed as the average result of local restrictions on the @xmath3 density , drastically affects the phase diagram by inducing an extinction threshold ( at @xmath47 for fixed @xmath48 ) for the predator population . taking spatial fluctuations into account",
    ", this becomes a genuine continuous active - to - absorbing phase transition for the @xmath1 species .",
    "it is now well - established that its critical properties are governed by the scaling exponents of directed percolation , with critical dimension @xmath49 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations of chemical kinetics on a lattice are usually performed with site occupation number restrictions ( e.g. , any lattice site may be occupied by at most one particle of either species ) since this situation is readily coded in a straightforward and efficient manner .",
    "indeed , for any stochastic simulation of chemical kinetics , a lack of site restrictions presents a challenge for efficient algorithms and data storage . unlike the restricted case",
    ", no upper bound can be placed on the number of occupants of a lattice site .",
    "thus , the memory structure must be made to follow the particles interacting on the lattice rather than just the lattice itself .",
    "this requirement calls for a more dynamic implementation of the simulation than simply flipping bits on a two - dimensional array .    in this subsection",
    ", we briefly overview several approaches to storing the particle information , and compare them in light of a decomposition of the demands the simulation will place on the data structure .",
    "we then present and explain the hybrid data structure utilized in our simulations .",
    "in essence , simulating diffusing and interacting particles on a lattice requires four operations repeated in different combinations , namely    1 .",
    "random selection : a lattice occupant is selected at random with a uniform probability , which allows for the simulation to proceed in an unbiased manner .",
    "query : this operation determines the number of particles of any species located on a given site at a specific instant ; it is desirable to render this operation fast which puts some constraints on the particle ordering in the data structure .",
    "3 .   add : a new particle is inserted into the lattice .",
    "4 .   remove : annihilates a particle from the lattice ; a particle movement can be implemented as sequential remove and add .",
    "considering these operations provides us with a frame in which to compare the competing data structures and algorithms for implementing site - unrestricted stochastic lattice simulations for particle reactions .    the first such candidate , a static array , is perhaps the most intuitive . in this implementation",
    ", we simply construct arrays ( in arbitrary @xmath50 dimensions ) of integer @xmath51-tuples , where each integer tells how many particles of a given species currently reside on that site .",
    "the problem of unbound variables is avoided by imposing some loose site restrictions , say by setting a cap of some large maximum number @xmath52 of particles per site .",
    "such a restriction would be irrelevant to the chemical kinetics unless we actually encounter such a large number on a single site , which is typically not likely .",
    "however , this implementation presents major problems with random selection .",
    "when restriction is in place , especially strong restrictions , such as allowing only a single occupant per site , the typical algorithm proceeds by selecting sites at random repeatedly until an occupied one is found . this can be duplicated for any site restriction , including very loose ones . however , with @xmath53 sites , @xmath54 occupants , and a site restriction of @xmath52 particles per site , this algorithm has a time complexity of @xmath55 , and thus very inefficient for very large @xmath52 . a more reliable algorithm , albeit still relatively slow , involves a full traversal of the lattice ; therefore , the best we can do here is @xmath56 .",
    "the next possible candidate is an unordered list with random access .",
    "this implementation would simply construct a very long list at the beginning of the simulation , and then proceed to populate it with the lattice occupants , where each entry keeps track of its own location in the lattice .",
    "this structure gives very fast random selection , insertion , and removal , all @xmath57 .",
    "however , since it is unordered , a query could easily require searching the entire list , which results in an @xmath58 performance for the query .",
    "we might try to enhance the query performance by ordering the list or constructing it as a tree ; in either case the search efficiency is improved to @xmath59 .",
    "but we also degrade the insertion and removal to @xmath59 . in the process , if we have constructed these data structures within the confines of an array so that we can maintain random access , random selection remains sufficiently fast , at @xmath57 .",
    "however , if we lose random access , as in the traditional linked list or binary search tree , we arrive at @xmath58 complexity for the random selection , since any random selection would require an ordered traversal of the tree or list .",
    "therefore , the data structure we propose hybridizes the first two candidates above to ensure constant time complexity for each of the necessary operations .",
    "what is required is to use a spatial array to allow fast addition , removal and queries , but to manage the memory in such a way as to provide random access to an unordered list of the occupants of the sites , therefore enabling immediate access for the uniformly random selection of an occupant . to accomplish this hybridization",
    ", we keep an unordered list of all the current occupants of the lattice .",
    "each of these maintains information about where in the lattice it is located . in turn",
    ", we maintain a spatial array of the lattice , where each site contains a pointer to the head of a linked list of occupants .",
    "the fact that these occupants are stored within the global , unordered list , imposes no constraint on our ability to render them elements of local linked lists . if for a given simulation it is desired to maintain unique information about each individual lattice occupant apart from its location , then this implementation does require some traversal of the site - local linked lists .",
    "this can become quite burdensome as the expected occupancy of a site grows . yet",
    "if we can sacrifice such individual information , we need only ever interact with the head of each site - local list , or an occupant that we have already found directly through the random selection .",
    "thus , constant time complexity can be maintained .      for each iteration of the simulation , a lattice occupant ( either predator or prey )",
    "is selected at random , and hops to a nearest - neighbour site , and may subsequently be subjected to an ( on - site ) reaction . to keep track of the evolution of the system through time @xmath60 , each such step is accompanied by an increment in time equal to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the total number of occupants at this instant . in this way , in a single time step , on average",
    "every occupant has been once selected for interaction .",
    "our specific monte carlo simulation for the unconstrained stochastic lattice lotka ",
    "volterra model proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "select a lattice occupant at random .",
    "2 .   select one of the @xmath63 sites ( on a hypercubic lattice in @xmath50 dimensions ) adjacent to this occupant , and move it there ( nearest - neighbour hopping ) .",
    "3 .   if the occupant is a @xmath3 particle ( prey ) : + generate a random number @xmath64 over the range @xmath65 ; if @xmath66 , add another new @xmath3 particle to the current site ( prey offspring production , @xmath67 ) .",
    "if the occupant is an @xmath1 particle ( predator ) : 1 .   if there are any @xmath3 particles ( prey ) located on this site :",
    "for _ each _ @xmath3 particle generate a random number @xmath68 over the range @xmath65 ; if @xmath69 , remove it from and add one new @xmath1 particle to this site ( predation interaction , @xmath70 ) ; 2 .",
    "generate a random number @xmath71 over the range @xmath65 ; if @xmath72 , remove this @xmath1 particle ( predator death , @xmath73 ) .    in our simulations , none of the possible events are mutually exclusive ; in particular , particle diffusion and on - site reactions can happen simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the hopping probability is held fixed at @xmath32 for the entire range of reaction parameters , which obviates the need for renormalization of the simulation time for different reaction rates .",
    "notice that in contrast with site - restricted simulations , where offspring particles need to appear at neighbouring sites which causes either species to propagate in space , here hopping processes have to be put in explicitly .",
    "all simulation runs reported below start from random initial spatial distributions of both predators @xmath1 and prey @xmath3 .",
    "we have also run simulations where step ( iv a ) above was modified : instead of exposing each prey on a given site to predation by the invading predator , we allowed only at most a single @xmath3 particle to be removed .",
    "figure [ snapsh ] depicts a set of snapshots from a simulation on a @xmath74 square lattice , run with rate parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 @xcite .    starting from a random ( poisson ) distribution of particles @xmath1 and @xmath3 ( a ) ,",
    "initially the predator population goes almost extinct , with a few localized specks of prey surviving . when predators encounter the regions inhabitated by the prey , they rapidly devour them , and subsequently die out ( c , d , e ) .",
    "eventually , the system settles in a dynamic steady state governed by expanding , competing , and merging diffuse activity fronts , forming complex spatio - temporal structures ( f ) .",
    "this temporal evolution resembles that observed in simulations with restricted site occupation numbers deep in the species coexistence phase ( compare , e.g. , figure  2 in @xcite and @xcite ) , except that the fronts are more diffuse in the unrestricted simulations , broadened by regions that contain both predators and prey ( colour - coded magenta / light grey ) .",
    "yet there is also a marked difference , namely the predator ",
    "prey competition is far more local and thus considerably faster in the present simulation runs .",
    "the emerging spatial structures can be characterized quantitatively through the static ( and translationally invariant ) correlation functions @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 denotes the occupation number for particle species @xmath81 at site @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ abcorr ] depicts the results for @xmath83 ( a ) , @xmath84 ( b ) , and @xmath85 ( c ) , as obtained from monte carlo simulations on a @xmath86 square lattice , with rates @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and various values of the predation rate @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "each set of measurements was initiated in a well - developed simulation , having run for @xmath90 time steps , which was subsequently performed for an additional @xmath91 time steps , while sampling the state of the system every @xmath92 steps .",
    "thus , the correlation results are averaged over @xmath93 separate times throughout the @xmath91 additional steps .",
    "the log - linear plots for @xmath83 and @xmath84 capture the essentially exponentially decaying correlations of particles of the same species .",
    "this suggests the form @xmath94 , with equal correlation lengths @xmath95 for the predators and prey ; in addition , both @xmath95 and the amplitude @xmath96 appear to depend only weakly on the predation rate .",
    "qualitatively similar ( but quantitatively different ) to simulations with restriced site occupation numbers ( compare figure  4 in @xcite ) , in figure [ abcorr](c ) we observe local anti - correlations between the @xmath1 and @xmath3 species for @xmath97 which are of course caused by the predation reaction",
    ". there are pronounced positive correlations up to about @xmath98 lattice constants , which indicates the width of the rather diffuse predator  prey activity fronts seen in figure  [ snapsh ] .      when the predator and prey total population densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 are plotted as functions of time @xmath60 , one finds marked oscillations in the early time regime , as shown for two examples in figure  [ abkosc ] .",
    "these stochastic oscillations reflect the recurrent spatio - temporal structures visible in figure  [ snapsh ] .",
    "as time progresses , the amplitude of these transient fluctuations decreases considerably , but as in simulations with site restrictions , in finite systems these transient oscillations may persist for a long time , see also figure  [ oscill](a ) below . increasing the reaction rates ( with the hopping rate fixed )",
    "effectively renders the processes more local , which suppresses front spreading and consequently reduces the amplitude of the population oscillations , as evident in figure  [ abkosc](b ) . in order to compare with the deterministic rate equations ,",
    "we have also plotted the quantity @xmath99 defined in , which according to the mean - field approximation would remain constant . yet",
    ", we see that it in fact oscillates roughly in phase with the particle densities : fluctuations evidently _ amplify _ at least the initial population cycles .",
    "it is important to note that ( in the thermodynamic limit ) the asymptotic long - time mean population densities as well as @xmath100 are determined by the reaction rates , and become _ independent _ of their initial values , as is confirmed in figure  [ abkosc ] .",
    "as already apparent from the analysis of the corresponding rate equations , in systems with limited prey carrying capacity an extinction threshold for the predator population appears at sufficiently low values of the predation rate @xmath5 ( with @xmath101 , @xmath48 held fixed ) .",
    "we have investigated our lattice model with ( almost ) unlimited prey occupation number in the limit of low values of @xmath5 , down to @xmath102 and found no signature of any phase transition : in the thermodynamic limit , this unconstrained predator  prey system seems to always allow species coexistence ( as usual , however , _",
    "systems should terminate in the absorbing state , albeit after potentially enormous crossover times ) . neither",
    "have we encountered a situation where the stable species coexistence regime is governed by a stable node fixed point , which would be approached without any population oscillations ; however , as mentioned before , for higher reaction rates the oscillations become strongly damped .",
    "figure  [ oscill ] depicts the population densities for an extended simulation run with rates @xmath75 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and initial values @xmath105 ( well away from the steady - state densities ) , along with the corresponding phase space trajectory in the @xmath106-@xmath107 plane , which should be compared with the mean - field pictures in figure  [ mforbt ] , computed with the same rates .",
    "obviously the initial state determines only transient behaviour , the long - time regime is governed by stochastic fluctuations about the attractive fixed point in the centre of the graph .",
    "we expect those to be quite well - described by the zero - dimensional effective urn model and the ` resonant amplification ' mechanism described in @xcite .",
    "additional information can be extracted from the simulation data by studying the ( fast ) fourier transforms @xmath108 and similarly @xmath109 of the time signals @xmath8 and @xmath9 . as shown in figure  [ ftpeak ] for runs with @xmath110 , @xmath76 , and @xmath104 , extended to @xmath111 , the predator and prey fourier signals display prominent peaks at the same characteristic frequency , which evidently governs the erratic oscillations .    in order to assess the validity of the linearized mean - field approximation result @xmath22 quantitatively",
    ", we have obtained the peak frequency values for various monte carlo simulations on @xmath86 square lattices , all run with @xmath104 and with either @xmath48 or @xmath101 held fixed at the value @xmath112 , while the respective other rate varied between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the results are displayed as a double - logarithmic plot in figure  [ ftpeak](b ) .",
    "interestingly , the simulation data show a more pronounced deviation from the square - root dependence on @xmath48 than on @xmath101 for low rates , while the reverse is true for large rates . moreover , the characteristic peak frequencies are reduced by about @xmath115 as compared with the mean - field prediction , obviously renormalized by stochastic fluctuations ; similar effects are found in site - restricted simulations ( see figure  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable though that for values between @xmath116 and @xmath117 the curves for varying rates @xmath48 or @xmath101 appear to coincide , which would indicate the simple functional dependence @xmath118 in this range .",
    "we have also obtained the age histograms @xmath119 for the total number of surviving prey up to time @xmath120 after they were produced .",
    "the log - linear plot in figure  [ bagdis](a ) , taken for @xmath76 , @xmath104 , and different values of @xmath121 on a @xmath86 square lattice , shows that the prey age distribution @xmath119 essentially decays exponentially with @xmath120 . from the slopes in these graphs",
    "we can read off the prey population inverse mean life time @xmath122 , which is plotted in figure  [ bagdis](b ) as function the rates @xmath101 ( with @xmath76 and @xmath104 held fixed ) , and as function of @xmath48 ( @xmath75 , @xmath104 ) .",
    "one finds that @xmath123 for the rate interval studied here , whereas it displays no markedly significant dependence on @xmath48 .",
    "this is indeed borne out already upon linearizing the mean - field rate equations about the steady state @xmath15 , which yields an effective prey death rate @xmath101 induced by the predation reaction , independent of @xmath48 .",
    "we have also run monte carlo simulations for our unconstrained lattice lotka  volterra model in one dimension .",
    "the total population densities as well as space - time plots for the first @xmath124 time steps are shown for two representative examples in figures  [ 1ddiff ] and [ 1dreac ] . in the first run ,",
    "the reaction rates are low ( all @xmath125 ) , and the kinetics is dominated the diffusion .",
    "correspondingly , the system remains well mixed , and displays a stochastic time signal .",
    "in the second simulation , with all rates set to @xmath89 , the on - site reactions dominate .",
    "localized prey population bursts occur , but invading predators quickly remove emerging prey clusters , subsequently proliferate and then die out , which leads to intriguing wedge - like structures in the early time regime . at any rate , we generally observe species coexistence during the duration of our runs , in accord with earlier investigations of a one - dimensional four - state system @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast with simulations with restricted site occupation numbers , where the system tends towards eventual predator extinction , with the asymptotic approach to the absorbing state proceeding via very slow coarsening processes , namely merging of the active domains , presumably governed by the @xmath126 power law of single - species coagulation ( see figure  11 in @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  3.2 , we have also performed simulations wherein an @xmath1 particle in each of its moves to a new site could annihilate at most one @xmath3 particle there . in effect",
    ", this sets an upper limit to the efficiency of the predation process , at variance with the rate equations , which induces interesting differences to the previous simulations with multiple simultaneous predation events when the prey density becomes large . at large predation rates @xmath127 ,",
    "the qualitative behaviour of this model variant is essentially as described above .",
    "however , there emerges one distinction when the reaction rates are large ( with the hopping rate @xmath128 held fixed ) , and the on - site reactive processes dominate .",
    "in this situation , instead of spreading diffuse predator  prey fronts , we have observed pulsating activity zones . in addition to the familiar erratic oscillations , these induce intermittent population spikes that tend to dominate the long - time properties of the system .",
    "( in fact , these localized population explosions set limits to the rates we could explore , because the maximum site occupation number bounds may become exceeded . )    more dramatically , when @xmath5 approaches @xmath48 from above , predation becomes too inefficient for the predators , and we find an extinction threshold for the @xmath1 population at ( or very near ) @xmath129 . for @xmath130",
    ", @xmath8 appears to decay exponentially ; at the transition , however , the predator density can apparently assume any value .",
    "a proper characterization of this unusual extinction transition would however require considerable additional effort .",
    "understanding biodiversity and identifying mechanisms allowing to maintain coevolution , as well as the influence of spatial distribution of the agents , are central problems in modern theoretical biology and ecology . in this context , we have studied a stochastic lattice version of the lotka  volterra model for the dynamics of two competing populations . as a main difference with numerous earlier studies , we have performed monte carlo simulations without any site restrictions , which can be interpreted in the biological or ecological context as a system without local limitation of the growth rate .",
    "this study is also of interest from a physical viewpoint because , at the determinsitic mean - field rate equations level , one naturally recovers the genuine lotka ",
    "volterra equations from the present stochastic model system .",
    "this investigation also allows to test further the robustness of stochastic predator ",
    "prey systems , which have been recently shown to share numerous properties . from a biological and ecological perspective",
    ", it is relevant to understand better the role of the presence or absence of some form of spatial limitation of the resources , which can be ( arguably ) simply mimicked by considering site restricted and unrestricted stochastic models , respectively .    after having briefly outlined the basic features of the lotka  volterra model in the framework of the mean - field rate equations , both for infinite and finite carrying capacity of the prey population , and explaining the procedure we have developed to efficiently structure the data , we have reported results of extensive simulations of our unrestricted stochastic predator  prey system . as a major difference with respect to the results for site - restricted models",
    ", we have found no evidence of any extinction threshold in our one- and two - dimensional simulations . with both types of agents",
    "being allowed to locally proliferate , both species are always found to coexist .",
    "similar to the site - restricted models deep in the coexistence phase , our unrestricted system is characterized by complex and correlated patterns emerging from ` pursuit and evasion ' wave fronts .",
    "these are rendered more diffuse in the present unrestricted simulations through regions accomodating both predators and prey on the same spots .",
    "the quantitative properties ( characteristic correlation lenghts ) of the patterns have been studied by computing various static correlation functions .",
    "the dynamical properties have been investigated by considering both time dependence of the densities and the trajectories in the phase portrait . as for restricted stochastic models ,",
    "the population densities are typically characterized by damped erratic oscillations , with an amplitude that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . however , as a novel feature , when the reaction rates dominate over the diffusive process , the reaction kinetics takes place largely locally ( on - site ) , and one observes , depending on the model variant , either quickly decaying oscillations , or pulsating activity zones and spikes in the density profiles . by means of a fourier analysis , and similar to the restricted case",
    ", we have found that the characteristic frequency of the damped and fluctuation - induced oscillations is markedly reduced with respect to the mean - field prediction , while its functional dependence seems in reasonable agreement with the deterministic result .",
    "we have also studied the prey age distribution and shown that it decays exponentially , with an inverse mean - life time independent of the death rate of the predators and depending linearly on the reproduction rate of the prey .",
