    "<S> it is also noteworthy that a strong variation of the islands aspect ratio can significantly affect the excited frequencies , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , in the nanowire and circular dot limits </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , we expect the thickness to play an important role in the ultra - thin film regime , where the anisotropy becomes perpendicular or can favor a vortex state inside each stadium .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the magnon band structure and the mode tunability at the @xmath49 point for a square ice in two equilibrium states , the vortex ( or ground ) state , and the remanent state , using a model that includes internal degrees of freedom of the islands as well as edge bending . </S>",
    "<S> the good quantitative agreement with micromagnetic simulations confirms the accuracy of the small - amplitude semi - analytical model while avoiding the computational limitations intrinsic to fully three - dimensional micromagnetic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that the magnon spectra , and therefore group and phase velocities as well as band gap , can be manipulated by external fields . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the edge modes give rise to separate magnon bands allowing for a larger parameter space in terms of magnon control . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that square ices can be considered metamaterials for spin waves . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the square ice is in principle reconfigurable in that the magnetization in individual islands can be changed by the application of external fields ( _ e.g. , _ from vortex to remanent state ) or temperature , or by using more sophisticated techniques such as using spin torque by patterning nanocontacts on the elements or making the elements part of magnetic tunnel junctions . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up the possibility of two - dimensional reprogrammable magnonic crystals comprised of an artificial square spin ice .    </S>",
