    "the mass generation mechanisms for electroweak gauge bosons and for fermions are among the most prominent mysteries in contemporary high energy physics . in the standard model ( sm ) and",
    "its supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions , elementary scalar doublets of the su@xmath7(2 ) interactions are responsible for the mass generation .",
    "the scalar higgs bosons are thus crucial ingredients in the theory , and searching for the higgs bosons has been one of the major motivations in the current and future collider programs @xcite . although the masses of higgs bosons are free parameters in the models , they are subject to generic bounds based on theoretical arguments .",
    "the triviality bound indicates that the higgs boson mass ( @xmath8 ) should be less than about 800 gev for the sm to be a consistent low - energy effective theory @xcite .",
    "vacuum stability argument , on the other hand , suggests a correlation between the @xmath8 lower bound and the new physics scale @xmath9 beyond which the sm is no longer valid @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the discovery of sm - like higgs boson implies a scale @xmath9 at which new physics beyond the sm must set in ; and the smaller @xmath10 is , the lower @xmath9 would be . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", it has been shown that the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson must be less than about 130 gev @xcite , and in any weakly coupled susy theory @xmath8 should be lighter than about 150 gev @xcite . on the experimental side , the non - observation of higgs signal at the lep2 experiments has established a lower bound on the sm higgs boson mass of 89.8 gev at a 95% confidence level ( cl ) @xcite .",
    "future searches at lep2 will eventually be able to discover a sm higgs boson with a mass up to 105 gev @xcite .",
    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is believed to be able to cover up to the full @xmath8 range of theoretical interest , about 1000 gev @xcite , although it will be challenging to discover a higgs boson in the `` intermediate '' mass region 110 gev @xmath11 150 gev , due to the huge sm background to @xmath12 and the requirement of excellent di - photon mass resolution for the @xmath13 signal .",
    "more recently , it has been discussed intensively how much the fermilab tevatron upgrade can do for the higgs boson search @xcite .",
    "it appears that the most promising processes continuously going beyond the lep2 reach would be the associated production of an electroweak gauge boson and the higgs boson @xcite @xmath14 the leptonic decays of @xmath15 provide a good trigger and @xmath12 may be reconstructible with adequate @xmath16-tagging .",
    "it is now generally believed that for an upgraded tevatron with a c.  m.  energy @xmath17 tev and an integrated luminosity @xmath18 a sm - like higgs boson can be observed at a @xmath19 level up to a mass of about 120 gev @xcite .",
    "the higgs discovery through these channels crucially depends up on the @xmath16-tagging efficiency and the @xmath20 mass resolution .",
    "it is also limited by the event rate for @xmath21 gev .",
    "it may be possible to extend the mass reach to about 130 gev by combining leptonic @xmath15 decays @xcite and slightly beyond via the decay mode @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this mass reach is just near the theoretical upper bound in mssm . in the context of a general weakly - coupled susy model , it would be of great theoretical significance for the upgraded tevatron to extend the higgs boson coverage to @xmath23 gev .",
    "moreover , it would have interesting implications on our knowledge for a new physics scale @xmath9 if we do find a sm - like higgs boson or exclude its existence in the mass range 130 gev@xmath24180 gev , the so - called `` chimney region '' between the triviality upper bound and the vacuum stability lower bound @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the leading production mechanism for a sm - like higgs boson at the tevatron is the gluon - fusion process via heavy quark triangle loops @xmath25 there are also contributions to @xmath26 production from the vector boson fusion processes generically denotes a @xmath27 boson of either on- or off - mass - shell . ]",

    "we perform detector level simulations by making use of a monte carlo program shw developed for the run - ii susy / higgs workshop @xcite .",
    "we present optimized kinematic cuts which can adequately suppress the large sm backgrounds and , moreover , have been structured so as to provide a statistically robust background normalization . for the @xmath53 channel , although the trilepton signal of eq .",

    "the isolation cut on @xmath73 removes the muon events from heavy quark ( @xmath74 ) decays .",
    "= 5.5 in    at this level , the largest background comes from the drell - yan process for @xmath75 production .",
    "however , the charged leptons in this background are very much back - to - back and this feature is also true , although to a lesser extent , for other background processes as well . on the other hand , due to the spin correlation of the higgs boson decay products ,",
    "the two charged leptons tend to move in parallel .",
    "we demonstrate this point in figs .",
    "[ phis ] and [ thes ] where the distributions of the azimuthal angle in the transverse plane [ @xmath76 and the three - dimensional opening - angle between the two leptons [ @xmath77 for the signal and backgrounds are shown .",
    "this comparison motivates us to impose the cuts @xmath78 the @xmath75 background can be essentially eliminated with the help of additional cuts @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the relative angle between the lepton pair transverse momentum and the missing transverse momentum , which is close to 180@xmath81 for the signal and near 0@xmath81 for the drell - yan @xmath75 background .",

    "@xcite , the lepton correlation angle between the momentum vector of the lepton pair and the momentum of the higher @xmath86 lepton ( @xmath87 ) in the lepton - pair rest frame , @xmath88 , also has discriminating power between the signal and backgrounds .",
