    "the cosmic ray spectrum has been now measured over a large range of energies , that extends in its upper part to more than @xmath0 ev , the so - called _ ultra high energy cosmic rays _ ( uhecrs ) .",
    "the quest for the origin of these high energy particles over the whole range is still open and represents one of the big challenges for the future . in the highest energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum ,",
    "several issues make the challenge even harder : a ) it is hard to envision possible acceleration sites where particles with energy in excess of @xmath0 ev may be accelerated ; b ) even if some class of sources could indeed accelerate particles to the highest energies , a homogeneous spatial distribution of these sources would leave an imprint in the cosmic ray spetrum , known as greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff , due to photopion production on the photons of the cosmic microwave background @xcite . on the basis of the first issue , we would expect an _ end of the cosmic ray spectrum _ to occur at some _ high _ energy . on the basis of the second issue",
    ", we would expect a strong flux suppression ( not really a cutoff ) at about @xmath1 ev .",
    "several experiments have been operating to detect the flux of uhecrs , starting with volcano ranch @xcite and continuing with haverah park @xcite and yakutsk @xcite to the more recent experiments like agasa @xcite , fly s eye @xcite and hires @xcite .    at present",
    "there is no clear indication that the cosmic ray spectrum comes to an end due to either one of these two reasons .",
    "more statistics of events is however required to achieve a solid conclusion in this respect .",
    "the physics involved in the explanation of the origin and propagation of uhecrs needs often to be pushed to its extremes to accomodate observations .",
    "this transforms a problem into a precious tool to probe a territory which is still uncharted , a new physics which several hints tell us should exist , but is still hidden somewhere . in the following",
    "we describe a few directions in which this investigation may lead .",
    "in  [ sec : observations ] we briefly summarize the status of current observations ; in  [ sec : gzk ] we restate the basic issues that are known as gzk problem ; in  [ sec : np ] we illustrate two examples of new physics that can be investigated with the help of uhecrs , namely physics close to the grand unification scale (  [ sec : td ] ) and possible violations of lorentz invariance (  [ sec : li ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the cosmic ray spectrum is measured from fractions of gev to a ( current ) maximum energy of @xmath2 ev .",
    "the spectrum above a few gev and up to @xmath3 ev ( the knee ) is measured to be a power law with slope @xmath4 , while at higher energies and up to @xmath5 ev ( the ankle ) the spectrum has a steeper slope , of @xmath6 . at energy",
    "larger than @xmath7 ev a flattening seems to be present .",
    "the statistics of events is changing continuously : an analysis of the `` all experiments '' statistics was carried out in @xcite and found 92 events above @xmath8 ev .",
    "47 events were detected by the agasa experiment .",
    "a more recent analysis @xcite of the agasa data , carried out expanding the acceptance angle to @xmath9 , has increased the number of events in this energy region to 59 .    in @xcite the directions of arrival of the agasa events ( with zenith angle smaller than @xmath10 ) above @xmath8 ev",
    "were studied in detail : no appreciable departure from isotropy was found , with the exception of a few small scale anisotropies in the form of doublets and triplets of events within an angular scale comparable with the angular resolution of the experiments ( @xmath11 for agasa ) .",
    "this analysis was repeated in @xcite for the whole sample of events above @xmath8 ev , and a total of 12 doublets and 3 triplets were found within @xmath12 angular scales .",
    "the attempt to associate these multiplets with different types of local astrophysical sources possibly clustered in the local supercluster did not provide evidence in that direction @xcite .",
    "recently , the agasa collaboration reported on the study of the small scale anisotropies in the extended sample of events with zenith angle @xmath13 : 5 doublets ( chance probability @xmath14 ) and 1 triplet ( chance probability @xmath15 ) were found .",
    "the information available on the composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is quite poor .",
    "a study of the shower development was possible only for the fly s eye event @xcite and disfavors a photon primary @xcite .",
    "a reliable analysis of the composition is however possible only on statistical basis , because of the large fluctuations in the shower development at fixed type of primary particle . the fly s eye collaboration reports evidence for a predominantly heavy composition at @xmath16 ev , with a smooth transition to light composition at @xmath5 ev .",
    "this trend was later not confirmed by agasa @xcite .",
    "recently in ref .",
    "@xcite the data of the haverah park experiment on highly inclined events were re - analyzed : this new analysis results in no more than @xmath17 of the events with energy above @xmath7 ev being consistent with photons or iron ( at @xmath18 confidence level ) and no more than @xmath19 of events being photons above @xmath8 ev .",
    "recently new data have been presented by the hires experiment @xcite .",
    "these new results seem to be in agreement with the presence of a gzk feature in the cosmic ray spectrum , and are therefore in disagreement with the agasa data . in order to quantify",
    "the discrepancy we ran some simulations @xcite of the statistics of events expected with the agasa and hires exposures . in table",
    "i we report our results : the first column gives the energy threshold used to measure the number of events quoted in the other columns .",
    "the injection spectrum is taken as @xmath20 , because it provides the best fit to the data points of agasa at lower energies .",
    "the evolution in the luminosity of the sources is taken as @xmath21 , where the 3 accounts for the redshift ( @xmath22 corresponds to no intrinsic evolution ) .",
    "for agasa we also considered the possibility that there is a systematic error of @xmath23 in the energy determination ( column indicated as @xmath24 sys . ) . from the numbers in the table",
    "we deduce that the agasa data do not agree with the gzk prediction at the level of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for @xmath22 ( @xmath27 ) . on the other hand hires data seem to agree with the predicted flux .",
    "clearly we need more data in order to finally settle the issue .    [",

    "the puzzle of uhecrs can be summarized in the following points :    * _ : _ acceleration mechanisms have to be pushed to their extremes in order to allow the production of particles with energy in excess of @xmath0 ev . * _ : _ observations show a remarkable large scale isotropy of the arrival directions of uhecrs , with no correlation with local structures ( e.g. galactic disk , local supercluster , local group ) . *",
    "_ : _ the small ( degree ) scale anisotropies , if confirmed by further upcoming experiments , would represent an extremely strong constraint on the type of sources of uhecrs and on magnetic fields in the propagation volume . at present",
    "no association has been found between the arrival directions of uhecrs and nearby bright sources . * _ : _ the gzk cutoff is mainly a geometrical effect : the number of sources within a distance that equals the pathlength for photopion production is far less than the sources that contribute lower energy particles , having much larger pathlength ( comparable with the size of the universe ) .",
    "the crucial point is that the cutoff is present even if plausible nearby uhecr engines are identified .",
    "the solution of the problem of uhecrs in its several aspects will come when many pieces will fall into place .",
    "a careful measurement of the spectrum of uhecrs and of their chemical composition will play a crucial role for the identification of the sources .",
    "in particular , the composition may be a smoking gun in favor or against whole classes of models .    in this section we consider in some more detail the issue of the gzk feature and the implications of its possible absence , suggested by the agasa data .",
    "it is often believed that the identification of one or a class of nearby uhecr sources would explain the observations and in particular the absence of the gzk feature .",
    "this is not necessarily true .",
    "the ( inverse of the ) lifetime of a proton with energy @xmath28 is plotted in fig . 1 ( left panel ) together with the derivative with respect to energy of the rate of energy losses @xmath29 ( right panel ) [ the figure has been taken from ref .",
    "the flux per unit solid angle at energy @xmath28 in some direction is proportional to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the density of sources ( assumed constant ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the source spectrum .",
    "this rough estimate suggests that the ratio of detected fluxes ( multiplied as usual by @xmath34 ) , at energies @xmath35 and @xmath36 is @xmath37 where in the last term we assumed that the source spectrum is a power law @xmath38 .",
    "if for instance one takes @xmath39 ev ( below @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 ev ( above @xmath40 ) , from fig . 1",
    "one obtains that @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the ratio @xmath46 gives a rough estimate of the suppression factor at the gzk cutoff and its dependence on the spectrum of the source .",
    "for flat spectra ( @xmath47 ) the cutoff is less significant , but it is more difficult to fit the low energy data @xcite ( at @xmath48 ev ) .",
    "steeper spectra make the gzk cutoff more evident , although they allow an easier fit of the low energy data .",
    "the simple argument illustrated above can also be interpreted in an alternative way : if there is a local overdensity of sources by a factor @xmath49 , the gzk cutoff is attenuated with respect to the case of homogeneous distribution of the sources .",
    "the question of whether we are located in such a large overdensity of sources was addressed , together with the propagation of uhecrs , in @xcite .",
    "assuming that the density of the ( unknown ) sources follows the density of galaxies in large scale structure surveys like pscz @xcite and cfa2 @xcite , the authors estimate the local overdensity on scales of several mpc to be of order @xmath50 , too small to compensate for the energy losses of particles with energy above the threshold for photopion production .    as discussed in  [ sec : observations ] , the current observational situation is not crystal clear in pointing toward the absence or the presence of the gzk feature in the data . recalling the sentence of enrico fermi , quoted in the beginning of this paper",
    ", we are in a ironic situation in which we have a @xmath51 discovery from agasa , and an equally significant measurement from the hires collaboration .",
    "what is absolutely clear is the need for higher statistics experiments , such as auger and euso , that fortunately are on the way .",
    "the bottom line of this section can be summarized in the following few points :    \\1 ) the gzk cutoff is not avoided by finding sources of uhecrs that lie within the pathlength of photopion production , unless these sources are located only or predominantly nearby and are less abundant at large distances .",
    "\\2 ) to establish without any doubt the statistical significance of the gzk feature in the cosmic ray data we need a statistics of events with energy @xmath52 ev larger than the present one .",
    "the enhanced statistics will also make easier to study the chemical composition and to identify the sources of uhecrs .",
    "uhecrs provide a laboratory where we may investigate the extremes of the physics we know and possibly check whether there is something more than that . in this paper",
    ", we discuss only two examples , one related to the production of uhecrs ( top - down models ) and the other , possible minuscule violations of lorentz invariance , that might affect the propagation of uhecrs on cosmological distances .",
    "many more examples may be found but will not beb discussed here . a come comprehensive review",
    "can be found in @xcite .      the old question of how the uhecrs are produced is as fashionable now as it was 30 years ago .",
    "the severe requirements needed for ordinary acceleration processes to achieve ultra - high energies have fueled much interest in production mechanisms that work from the top , meaning that particles are not accelerated but rather injected as a result of the decay of very massive unstable relics of the big bang .",
    "this may occur either as a result of decay processes of topological defects or by decays / annihilations of supermassive relic particles .",
    "topological defects are naturally formed at phase transitions and their existence has been proven by direct observations in several experiments on liquid crystals and ferromagnetic materials .",
    "similar symmetry breakings at particle physics level are responsible for the formation of cosmic topological defects [ for a review see @xcite ] .    the fact that topological defects can generate uhecrs was first proposed in the pioneering work in ref .",
    "the general idea is that the stability of the defect can be locally broken by different types of processes and result in the false vacuum , trapped within the defect , to fall into the real vacuum ( outside universe ) , so that the gauge bosons of the field trapped in the defect acquire a mass @xmath53 . at this point",
    ", the very massive and unstable particles rapidly decay producing high energy particles .",
    "several topological defects have been studied in the literature : ordinary strings @xcite , superconducting strings @xcite , bound states of magnetic monopoles @xcite , networks of monopoles and strings @xcite , necklaces @xcite and vortons @xcite .",
    "the basic idea , common to all td models , is that the decay of a supermassive particle results in the production of a quark - antiquark pair that hadronizes into mesons and protons . at the source , the composition of the produced particles",
    "is dominated by gamma rays and neutrinos , while only about @xmath54 of the energy goes into protons .",
    "after propagation over cosmological distances , the relative abundance of gamma rays and protons changes , as illustrated in fig .",
    "gamma rays become then dominant only at extremely high energies , although an appreciable fraction of the composition is still made of gamma rays .",
    "much discussion exists on which topological defects may generate the observed fluxes , as summarized in @xcite .    an interesting alternative to topological defects",
    "is represented by super - heavy ( sh ) relics of the big bang .",
    "sh particles with very long lifetime can be produced in the early universe and generate uhecrs at present @xcite . in the following , we will call these particles _ x - particles_.    x - particles can be produced in the early universe through different mechanisms .",
    "the simplest of them is the _ gravitational production _ :",
    "particles are produced naturally in a time variable gravitational field or indeed in a generic time variable classical field . in the gravitational case",
    "no additional coupling is required ( all particles interact gravitationally ) .",
    "if the time variable field is the inflaton field @xmath55 , a direct coupling of the x - particles to @xmath55 is needed .",
    "the gravitational production of particles was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "it does not require any additional assumption neither on the x - particles nor on cosmology . in particular inflation",
    "is not required a priori , and indeed it reduces the effect .",
    "it can be shown that at time t , gravitational production can only generate x - particles with mass @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the hubble constant and @xmath58 is the inflaton mass .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the fraction of the critical mass contributed by x - particles with @xmath59 gev produced gravitationally is @xmath60 , with no additional assumption ! in other words , cold dark matter can naturally be explained in terms of x - particles in this range of masses .    as mentioned in the beginning of this section , in order for x - particles to be useful dark matter candidates and generate uhecrs they need to be long lived .",
    "the gravitational coupling by itself induces a lifetime much shorter than the age of the universe for the range of masses which we are interested in .",
    "therefore , in order to have long lifetimes , additional symmetries must be postulated : for instance discrete gauge symmetries can protect x - particles from decay , while being very weakly broken , perhaps by instanton effects @xcite .",
    "these effects can allow decay times larger than the age of the universe , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the slow decay of x - particles produces uhecrs .",
    "the interesting feature of this model is that x - particles cluster in the galactic halo , as cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "hence uhecrs are expected to be produced locally , with no absorption . as a consequence ,",
    "the observed spectra are nearly identical to the emission spectra , and therefore gamma rays dominate .",
    "the very flat spectra and the gamma ray composition are two of the signatures .",
    "the calculations of the expected fluxes have been performed in @xcite . in figure 3",
    "we report a typical prediction of the spectra for this model , as derived in @xcite .",
    "the strongest signature of the model is the anisotropy due to the asymmetric position of the sun in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these papers agree that the present data are consistent with the anisotropy expected in the model of x - particles in the halo , due to the large uncertainties in the measurement of anisotropy .",
    "in fact , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] , observations at present do not show any appreciable deviation from isotropy , with the exception of a few degree scale anisotropies showing up in the form of doublets and triplets of events within an angular scale comparable to the resolution of the experiments .    in td models",
    "the presence of these multiplets of events is not well accomodated because of the homogeneous distribution of the topological defects or of the sh particles .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that in the latter the presence of the multiplets may actually be accomodated .    as an alternative to the long lifetimes required by the decay of sh relics ,",
    "a model based on their annihilation has been proposed @xcite , where however large annihilation cross - sections are required .",
    "uhecrs are the particles with the largest lorentz factor that we have been able to measure .",
    "they are then the most powerful probe to test the validity of lorentz invariance ( li ) , one of the fundamental ideas of known physics .",
    "li violations affect the propagation of uhecrs mainly because they may change the kinematic thresholds for photopion production , although other effects have also been investigated .",
    "the pioneering work in this direction was presented in @xcite .",
    "a very general parametrization of the violation of li was discussed in @xcite , where it was shown that the threshold may even move to infinite energy of the ultra high energy proton , meaning that the reaction becomes kinematically forbidden .",
    "the possible violation of lorentz invariance at the planck scale has been proposed by several authors as a possible explanation of the detection of events with energy above @xmath0 ev .",
    "however , it is clear from the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] that the current number of such events is not sufficient to justify such a proposal .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of the spectrum of uhecrs can provide interesting constraints on the strength of the li violation , if the gzk feature is detected by upcoming experiments .",
    "recently , an interesting extension of the previous ideas on violation of li was discussed in @xcite . in the new approach ,",
    "the violation is induced by the quantum fluctuations of the space - time foam : if the planck length is the smallest length which can be measured , then this scale also represents a lower limit on the error in a length measurement , and in particular of the de broglie length of a particle .",
    "the induced uncertainty in the momentum of the particle is @xmath61 , so that energy and momentum can be written as @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are randomly distributed numbers with unit variance , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the average energy and momentum .",
    "moreover the fluctuations in the metric can be written in the following form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is also a random number with normal distribution and unit variance .",
    "when applied to the process of photopion production , the effect of the metric fluctuations is to move the threshold for photopion production around the _ classical _ value .",
    "however , as demonstrated in @xcite , when the reaction remains kinematically allowed , the threshold is moved to @xmath3 ev , so that on average the effect of violation of li due to a fluctuating metric is mostly of making low energy particles vulnerable to photopion production @xcite",
    "the search for the end of the cosmic ray spectrum , started a few decades back in time , is still ongoing and still not successful .",
    "this challenge led us to the detection of particles with energies in excess of @xmath0 ev .",
    "acceleration processes are strongly limited by energy losses and finite size of the known acceleration regions and only some types of sources are barely able to energize protons up to the observed energies @xcite .",
    "composition and anisotropy studies will be the keys to solve the mystery , but at the cost of increasing the statistics by at least a factor of 10 compared with current experiments .",
    "two experiments are being planned for the next decade or so , and will provide the characteristics necessary to do cosmic ray astronomy : the auger project @xcite is currently in the construction stage in argentina , while the euso project @xcite is scheduled for operation starting in 2008 .",
    "each one of these enterprises implies an improvement by a factor @xmath69 compared with the previous one , which means a predicted 500 events per year above @xmath0 ev for euso , if the agasa spectrum is taken as a template .",
    "besides being the tools for ultra high energy cosmic ray astronomy , these experiments represent a unique tool to study possible new physics at extremely high energies .",
    "the case of neutrino oscillations provides an example of the first hint of the existence of physics beyond the standard model of particle interactions , derived in an astrophysics context .",
    "it is foreseeable that the ball of particle physics , after a few decades , could go back to the field of cosmic rays , where the first steps in that direction were moved in the 30s .",
