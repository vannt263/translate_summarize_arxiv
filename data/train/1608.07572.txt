    "the spectrum of atoms and ions encodes information that provides a key to the ground - state properties of nuclei @xcite , small parity - violating effects caused by the weak interaction @xcite , for unitarity tests of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , or for probing the higgs coupling between electrons and quarks @xcite .",
    "+ light appearing on earth from stars at large distances is red shifted and can provide information about the spectra of atoms in ancient times and whether there have been changes , for example from a variation of the fine structure constant @xmath1 .",
    "however , isotopic composition can also contribute to the observed shifts since the isotopes have different resonance frequencies , but this so - called isotope shift is usually not resolved @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "isotope shift calculations became recently an important topic with the goal to either determine the influence of the isotopic abundance of the observed species on the analysis for a change in @xmath1 @xcite , or to provide information of the isotopic composition in the ancient times of the universe .",
    "+ calcium is an element of considerable interest for many of the cases mentioned above .",
    "for example the isotope shift information in the @xmath2 infrared triplet @xcite led to the discovery of an anomalous isotopic composition in mercury - manganese ( hgmn ) stars , in which the isotopic ca ratio in the stellar atmosphere is dominated by @xmath3ca @xcite .",
    "isotope shifts in other calcium transitions have been studied , e.g. , to extract nuclear charge radii along the long chain of isotopes @xcite or to perform ultra - trace analysis using isotope selective resonance ionization @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the calcium ion is a workhorse in the field of quantum - optical applications and transition frequencies and isotope shifts of stable isotopes were measured with high accuracy @xcite and supported on - line studies of exotic isotopes since they serve as calibration points @xcite .",
    "the calcium isotopic chain is quite unique since it contains two stable doubly magic isotopes @xmath4ca@xmath5 that have practically identical mean - square charge radii even though they are 20% different in mass .",
    "this has been established using a variety of techniques , i.e. elastic electron scattering @xcite , muonic atom spectroscopy @xcite as well as optical isotope shift data , e.g. @xcite ( for a synopsis see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the negligible change in nuclear charge radius between the two isotopes allows for a cleaner separation of mass and field shifts than in most other multi - electron systems .",
    "the high - precision data presented here will provide important benchmarks for improved calculations of this reference system .",
    "the extraction of nuclear parameters from atomic spectra is strongly facilitated by atomic structure calculations . despite being a lighter system with only 19 electrons , isotope shifts in the singly ionized calcium ( ca@xmath6 ) have not been studied rigorously .",

    "isotope shift measurements of this transition with the same resolution are compared with a measurement of the d1 line @xcite . a clear signature of field shift contributions to the splitting isotope shift are observed . to explain this finding , we have also performed several _ ab initio _ calculations of field shift constants employing a hydrogenic method , a mean - field method using dirac - fock ( df ) equation , and state - of - the - art atomic structure calculations .",

    "this motional excitation is mapped into an electronic excitation using a stimulated rapid adiabatic passage ( stirap ) pulse on the @xmath8mg@xmath5 ion @xcite .",
    "the high photon sensitivity of this technique provides a large signal - to - noise ratio , resulting in a resolution of about 100khz in less than 15min of averaging time . as a consequence of the smallness of systematic effects , the accuracy of absolute frequency measurements is also about 100khz .",

    "isotope shifts in atomic transition frequencies originate from two effects : ( _ i _ ) a change in the size of the nucleus and a corresponding change of potential experienced by electrons having a finite probability density inside the nucleus ( field shift ) , and ( _ ii _ ) a change of the center of mass motion of the nucleus ( mass shift ) .",
    "the mass effect is more important for light nuclei due to the relatively large mass differences , while the field shift is proportional to the electron density inside the nucleus , which increases roughly with @xmath11 and is the dominant contribution in elements with large atomic number @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the isotope shift is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the frequencies of transition @xmath16 for isotopes with mass @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . the mass shift contribution to the isotope shift of a one - electron atom",
    "can be calculated by replacing the electron mass @xmath19 by the reduced mass of the system and leads to @xmath20 it is called the normal mass shift ( nms ) and the prefactor of the mass scaling @xmath21 is the normal mass shift constant . in a multi - electron system ,",
    "the nuclear recoil depends on the sum of all electron momenta and therefore the mass polarization term or specific mass shift ( sms ) can have a considerable contribution with the same mass - scaling .",
    "the corresponding constant @xmath22  is notoriously difficult to calculate since it includes all electron momenta .",
    "the difference in the transition frequency , @xmath23 , between isotopes with mass  @xmath24 and  @xmath18 can in total be expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ( total ) mass shift constant , @xmath27  is the field shift constant , and @xmath28 is the corresponding change in the mean - square nuclear charge radius of the two isotopes .",
    "here we simplified the mass - dependence term by the approximated dependence as it is usally used in the literature .",
    "neglecting the additional electron mass in the denominator of eq.([eq : reducedmassis ] ) leads to a change only of the order of @xmath29 . to extract nuclear charge radii from isotope shifts ,",
    "one needs reliable numbers for the mass shift and field shift constants , which can be obtained only from semi - empirical approaches or from ab - initio calculations .",
    "reasonable agreement is usually obtained between these techniques .",
    "one of the most important procedures in this respect is the king plot @xcite , of which two versions exist that have different applications .",
    "both will be used below when analyzing the data .",
    "+ the general approach is to multiply both sides of eq.([eq : is ] ) with the inverse mass factor @xmath30 and obtain @xmath31 the relation allows one to eliminate the unknown nuclear charge radii if measurements are performed in two different transitions @xmath16 and @xmath32 for the same isotopes @xmath33 this is a linear relation between the so - called modified isotope shifts @xmath34 in the two transitions @xmath16 , @xmath32 and can be used to extract the respective ratio of the field shift constants or the relation of the mass shift constants . alternatively , eq.([eq : modis ] ) can be used with data of a single transition to directly obtain field shift and mass shift constants .",
    "this requires mean - square charge radii or their respective changes @xmath28 for a subset of at least 3 isotopes from other sources .",
    "usually , radii from elastic electron scattering or x - ray transitions in muonic atoms are used , see e.g. , ref .",

    ", a linear regression delivers the field shift constant as the slope and the mass shift constant as the interception with the @xmath36-axis .",
    "a multidimensional regression can be used if information from several transitions is available .    applying the extracted mass shift and field shift constants , charge radii of other , especially short - lived isotopes can be obtained .",
    "however , the accuracy of the extracted nuclear charge radii with these procedures is often hampered by the insufficient accuracy of the charge radii data from external sources or the limited number of stable isotopes .",
    "odd-@xmath12 elements for example have only one or two stable isotopes , which renders the usage of the king - plot procedure impossible . high - precision isotope shift data with accuracy better than 1mhz has rarely been obtained beyond the lightest elements hydrogen @xcite , helium @xcite , lithium @xcite and beryllium @xcite where they are used to either extract nuclear charge radii of stable and short - lived isotopes or to test many - body non - relativstic quantum electrodynamics calculations ( nr - qed ) .",
    "similarly accurate data does so far only exist for the d1 and d2 lines in magnesium @xcite and the d1 line in calcium @xcite , all obtained by laser spectroscopy in paul traps .",
    "small differences in mass corrected isotope shifts between transitions of the same fine structure multiplet provide information on subtle ( relativistic ) effects of the electronic wavefunction .",
    "a @xmath0-dependence of the field shift constant has already been reported in the @xmath37 doublet in ba ii , where a field shift difference of 2.5(3)% was observed @xcite . in lighter isotopes these effects , caused by different contributions of the smaller component of the dirac wavefunction ,",

    ", we report on high - precision calcium isotope shift measurements in the d2 line for @xmath38ca from which we extract differences in the probability density of the electrons at the nucleus and the mass dependence of the difference between the isotope shifts in the two transitions @xmath39 of a fine structure doublet , the so - called splitting isotope shift ( sis ) @xmath40 which can also be understood as the change of the fine structure splitting between the respective isotopes .",

    "we obtain the field shift constant for the d1 and d2 lines as @xmath103mhz/@xmath59 and @xmath104mhz/@xmath59 in the ccsd method and @xmath105mhz/@xmath59 and @xmath106mhz/@xmath59 in the ccsd(t ) method .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the ccsd and ccsd(t ) methods respectively .",
    "we compare the experimental results on the field shift constants and their ratios in table  [ tab : comparison_theory_exp ] with the ones obtained from the ccsd(t ) method .",
    "the ratio obtained in ccsd(t ) is close to the hydrogenic value , but still considerably smaller than the experimental result .    as an alternative approach to the ccsd(t )",
    "method we have examined the correlation potential method  @xcite and the combination of configuration interaction and many - body perturbation theory ( ci+mbpt )  @xcite .",
    "both methods give very consistent results . in the first method",
    "we create a correlation potential @xmath109 to second order in the residual coulomb interaction .",
    "we include this potential in the df hamiltonian and solve to create `` brueckner '' orbitals .",
    "the field shift is obtained by varying the nuclear radius , repeating the entire calculation , and extracting the dependence of the energy eigenvalue .",
    "this ` finite field ' method is similar to that previously applied to calculations of field shift in ca@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "it includes certain chains of diagrams to all - orders , for example so - called random - phase approximation corrections are included .",
    "our result for the d2/d1 ratio using brueckner orbitals is @xmath110 .",
    "this value is directly comparable to the third - order mbpt results of safronova and johnson  @xcite who also obtain @xmath110 .    in the second method",
    "we perform a configuration interaction ( ci ) calculation allowing for single and double excitations from the @xmath111 and @xmath112 hole states .",
    "correlations with the frozen core ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 shells ) are included at second - order in mbpt by modifying the radial integrals of the ci calculation .",
    "this ` particle - hole ' ci+mbpt method is similar to that introduced in hg@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "it improves upon the brueckner calculation in that correlations with the core @xmath111 and @xmath112 shells are taken into account to all order ( only double excitations are included , but triple excitations in this calculation are not important ) .",
    "again we use the finite - field method to obtain the field shift .",
    "the final results presented in tables 7 and 8 is the ci+mbpt method , with the difference from the brueckner calculation taken as an indicative uncertainty .",
    "note that qed effects are not included in these results .",
    "they can contribute up to 2  mhz/@xmath59 , to @xmath115 and @xmath116 , but as discussed previously they have a much smaller effect on the ratio .    in table",
    "[ tab : theo ] we summarize our theoretical predictions of the field  shift ratio @xmath46 .",
    "as expected , the hydrogenic value provides the upper bound of the ratio @xmath94 while the electron correlations lead to a reduction of @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , one can see from the table that the experimental result for the relativistic correction to the ratio of field - shift constants , i.e. @xmath117 , is 70% larger than all available calculations , including even @xmath97 .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath118 and the best theoretical models is about 3@xmath119 of the experimental uncertainty ; its reason is still unclear and will require future study .",
    "we presented absolute frequency and isotope shift measurements of the d2 line in even calcium isotopes at the 100  khz level .",
    "the high accuracy of the measurement was enabled through photon recoil spectroscopy on trapped and sympathetically cooled ions using a spectroscopy laser referenced via an optical frequency comb to a calibrated hydrogen maser at ptb . from a multi - dimensional king plot analysis including data from previous measurements on the d1 and transitions , we derived a slightly improved set of field and mass constants for these transitions , and changes in the nuclear charge radius between isotopes .",
    "in particular , the measurements revealed for the first time field shift contributions to the splitting isotope shift in a light ion . using the experimental data as a benchmark , we have performed theoretical calculations of the field shift constants and their ratios by using a simple hydrogenic approach , by solving the dirac - fock equation , also including core polarization , by relativistic coupled - cluster calculations including up to triples excitation , and by combining configuration interaction and many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the individual field shift constants for the d1 and d2 line derived from the coupled - cluster and many - body perturbation theory calculation show satisfactory agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , we experimentally found a surprisingly large ratio of the field shifts in the d2 and d1 fine structure duplet , @xmath118 .",
    "the relativistic correction to this value , @xmath120 , is about 70% larger than the theoretical estimates , which is a 3 @xmath119 of experimental uncertainty .",
    "the account of electron - electron interactions leads to a further reduction of the theoretical value @xmath121 and , hence , to an even larger discrepancy with the experiment .",
    "for example , based on the ccsd theory we found that the difference of the d1 and d2 field shifts of 0.18% is considerably smaller than the 0.83% found in the experiment .",
    "the origin of this unexpectedly large difference must be clarified by further theoretical and experimental studies .",
