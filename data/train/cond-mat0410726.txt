    "the strength and break - up of agglomerates composed of smaller sized primary particles is of particular importance for the storage and handling of materials in process industries such as pharmaceuticals , chemicals , fertilizers , detergent , and food industries . in industrial processes",
    "agglomerates often collide with each other and with the hard walls of the equipment resulting in a size reduction , which is desired or not depending on the type of the process .",
    "the strength of agglomerates has to be characterized for the design of operating conditions in industrial processes such as milling , tabletting , mixing , and transport in pneumatic conveying .",
    "another important class of agglomerates are the so - called particle compounds , which are the combination of various sized particles embedded in a cementous matrix .",
    "the different types of engineering agglomerates and building materials like concretes are some examples of particle compounds .",
    "it is of high industrial importance to recycle these particle compounds in order to use the valuable aggregates .",
    "the design and optimization of the liberation process of aggregates from the matrix material requires a detailed knowledge of the strength and break - up of compounds .    for the understanding of the strength and break - up process , the study of simple systems like spherical particles is essential . during the last decades several experimental and theoretical studies",
    "have been performed to understand the break - up of spherical bodies arising due to impact .",
    "the crack pattern of sand - cement spheres by a free fall impact was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which reports observations of meridian cracks , that divide the sphere into two nearly equal parts , and oblique cracks , which are straight like median cracks , but cut the sphere into two unequal pieces .",
    "the fracture of glass and plaster spheres by free fall impact and double impact ( dynamic loading between two hard plates ) have been carried out recently @xcite .",
    "it was found that at the lowest impact velocities hertzian cone cracks ( formed from a surface ring crack ) are developed , whereas , at high velocities , oblique cracks propagate before meridian cracks form @xcite .",
    "this finding differs from the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that with increasing impact energy , the number of meridian planes increases and oblique cracks start to develop .    due to the high speed and violent nature of the break - up process",
    ", observations are usually restricted to the final state of impact experiments , where information has to be extracted from the remaining pieces of the body .",
    "hence , computer simulation of models of agglomerate break - up is an indispensable tool in this field .",
    "simulations of realistic models provide a deeper inside into the break - up process and can even complement the experimental findings directly supporting the design of industrial processing of these materials .",
    "analytic approaches have limited capabilities in this field since they can not capture the disordered microstructure of the material .",
    "the finite element approach and the discrete element modeling have been successfully applied to describe the stress field , crack propagation , and fragment formation in impacting spherical particles @xcite .",
    "recent simulations of ball impact revealed two types of crack patterns : oblique cracks radiating from impact point , and secondary cracks perpendicular to the oblique ones . in the framework of the discrete element method",
    "it was clarified that depending on the impact velocity the result of the break - up process can be localized damage around the contact zone , fragmentation , or shattering .",
    "the evolution of several characteristic quantities of the break - up process when increasing the impact velocity were monitored and analyzed in normal and oblique impact @xcite .    from a more general point of view",
    ", the break - up of agglomerates presents an important class of fragmentation phenomena which is ubiquitous in everyday life and concerns a wide range of phenomena in science and technology . in general , when an object is subjected to shock or stress it will break up into smaller pieces .",
    "the length scales involved in this process range from the collisional evolution of asteroids @xcite to the degradation of materials comprised of small agglomerates @xcite employed in the process industries as summarized above .",
    "there are also many geological examples associated with the use of explosives for mining and oil shale industry , coal heaps , etc . a wide variety of experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite revealed that the fragment mass distribution is a power law except for very large fragment sizes .",
    "the exponents in the power law region were found experimentally to be between 1.35 and 2.6 depending on the effective dimensionality of the system @xcite .",
    "recent studies revealed that power law distributions arise in fragmentation phenomena due to an underlying phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , most of the data reported in the literature is concerned with the general behavior of fragmentation processes .",
    "there is much less literature where the propagation and orientation of cracks are discussed .    in the present paper",
    "we study the normal and oblique impact of a circular brittle particle on a hard frictionless plate , varying the impact velocity and impact angle in a broad range .",
    "the particle is composed of numerous unbreakable , undeformable , randomly shaped polygons which are bonded together by elastic beams .",
    "the bonds between the polygons can be broken according to a physical breaking rule , which takes into account the stretching and bending of the connections . based on simulations of the model",
    ", we performed a detailed study of the failure evolution at different impact velocities and of the nature of the crack propagation during the fragmentation process , and compared the results with experiments @xcite . in the analysis of the simulation data , we profit from recent theoretical results of general studies of fragmentation processes .",
    "we observed that for both normal and oblique impacts , the crack patterns are the same and depend solely on the normal component of the impact velocity . studying the crack patterns , amount of damage , fragment masses , and velocities , we provide a quantitative foundation of the concept of damage , fragmentation , and shattering in ball impact , which was introduced recently on a more qualitative basis @xcite .",
    "we show the existence of a critical impact velocity @xmath0 which distinguishes two regimes of the impact process , _ i.e. _ below the critical velocity damage mainly occurs in a conical region around the impact site with a large residue , however , above @xmath0 an ensemble of oblique cracks develop and the disc breaks up into pieces . in agreement with experimental results ,",
    "fragment masses are found to follow the gates - gaudin - schuhmann distribution ( power law ) @xcite with an exponent independent of the velocity and angle of impact .",
    "the velocity distribution of fragments exhibit an interesting anomalous scaling behavior when changing the impact velocity and the size of the disc .",
    "an important application of our results , besides the ones mentioned at the beginning , is to the optimization and control of tumbling mill performance .",
    "these questions are of utmost practical importance as they have a tremendous influence on power draft , wear of the balls and liners and breakage characteristics of the grinding materials . during the cataracting motion where the charge material inside a mill follows a parabolic path @xcite ,",
    "most of the materials are ground as hard balls fall back onto them .",
    "there is particular interest in the net energy required to achieve a certain size reduction and the the energy distribution of the fragments during the grinding process .",
    "the efficiency of the mills could be controlled if the breakage characteristics of the grinding materials were better understood .",
    "our current work can provide some valuable information for the modernization of the mill design .",
    "in order to study fragmentation of granular solids , we performed molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations in two dimensions . to better capture the complex structure of a real solid ,",
    "we used randomly generated convex polygons that interact with each other elastically .",
    "the model consists of three major parts , namely , the construction of a voronoi cellular structure , the introduction of the elastic behavior , and finally the breaking of the solid .",
    "this section gives a detailed overview of these three steps .    in order to take into account the complex structure of the granular solid , we use",
    "randomly generated convex polygons , _",
    "i.e. _ we divide the solid into grains by a voronoi cellular structure .",
    "the voronoi construction is a random tessellation of the plane into convex polygons .",
    "this is obtained by putting a random set of points onto the plane and then assigning to each point that part of the plane which is nearer to it than to any other point .",
    "one advantage of the voronoi tessellation is that the number of neighbors of each polygon is limited which makes the computer code faster and allows us to simulate larger systems . in our case",
    ", the initial configuration of the polygons was constructed using a vectorizable random lattice , which is voronoi construction with slightly reduced disorder @xcite .",
    "first , the voronoi tessellation of a square is performed , and then a circular disc with smooth surface is cut out .    in the model the polygons are rigid bodies .",
    "they are neither breakable nor deformable , but they can overlap when pressed against each other .",
    "this overlap represents local deformations of the grains .",
    "usually the overlapping polygons have two intersection points which define the contact line . in order to simulate the elastic contact force",
    ", we introduce a repulsive force between touching polygons .",
    "this force is proportional to the overlapping area @xmath1 divided by a characteristic length @xmath2 @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the radii of circles of the same area as the polygons ) .",
    "the direction of the elastic or normal force is perpendicular to the contact line of the polygons .",
    "the complete form of the normal force contains an elastic and damping contribution , whereas the tangential component is responsible for the friction .    again , to bond the particles together it is necessary to introduce a cohesive force between neighboring polygons . for this purpose",
    "we introduce beams .",
    "the centers of mass of neighboring polygons are joined together with elastic beams that exert an attractive , restoring force but can break in order to model the fragmentation of the solid . because of the randomness contained in the voronoi tessellation , the lattice of beams is also random .",
    "the length , the cross - section and the moment of inertia of each beam are determined by the initial configuration of the polygons .",
    "the young s modulus of the beams and of the particles are considered to be independent of each other .",
    "the beams break according to a physical breaking rule , which takes into account the stretching and bending of the connection .",
    "the surface of the grains where beams are broken represent cracks .",
    "the energy stored in the broken beams represents the energy needed to create these new crack surfaces inside the solid .    in order to simulate the break - up of the disc due to impact with a hard plate , a repulsive force",
    "is introduced between the plate and those polygons of the disc which have overlap with the plate .",
    "this repulsive force is proportional to the overlap area , similarly to the polygon - polygon contacts but with a higher stiffness value .",
    "the contact force of the disc and the plate has vertical direction , tangential component like friction is excluded in the present study .",
    "the time evolution of the system is obtained by numerically solving newton s equations of motion of the individual polygons ( molecular dynamics ) .",
    "for the solution of the equations we use a gear predictor - corrector scheme of fifth order , which means that we have to keep track of the coordinates and all their derivatives up to fifth order",
    ". the breaking criterion of beams is evaluated in each iteration time step and those beams which fulfill the condition are removed from the calculations .",
    "the simulation stops after no beams break during a certain number of time steps .",
    "previously this model has been applied to study fragmentation of solids in various experimental situations @xcite . for",
    "more details of the simulation technique see ref .",

    "[ scalev ] , [ scaler ] demonstrate that by appropriate rescaling the axes one can merge the curves obtained at different values of the macroscopic variables onto a single curve . in the case of the @xmath12 components ,",
    "the transformation is a stretching and shrinking by a power of @xmath11 on the vertical and horizontal axis , respectively .",
    "however , for the @xmath6 components , a combination of a linear shift and a shrinking by a power of @xmath11 is required .",
    "the good quality of the data collapse implies that the @xmath11 and @xmath9 dependence of the distributions can be cast in the form @xmath13 where the parameter values @xmath14 ,",

    "it has to be emphasized that the above scaling behavior is valid only above the critical velocity @xmath0 ; below @xmath0 no scaling was found .",
    "the scaling form of the distribution of the velocity components have also consequences for the spatial distribution of the flying pieces after impact .",
    "the increase of the width of the distributions with increasing impact velocity and disc radius implies that the flying fragments are more dispersed in space .",
    "we studied the normal and oblique impact of a circular brittle particle on a hard frictionless plate using a cell model of cohesive granular materials .",
    "we carried out a detailed analyses of the evolution of the crack pattern arising in the disc during the impact process , and of the mass and velocity distributions of fragments in the final state .",
    "for both normal and oblique impact , a cone shaped damage region is formed at the impact point whose base area increases gradually as the velocity of impact increases .",
    "cracks start to develop from the the conical damaged region where the maximum stress concentration exists .",
    "the oblique crack patterns obtained resemble those of the experimental findings @xcite , where oblique cracks moving along the plane of maximum compression were found . in agreement with the experimental observations , the oblique cracks in our simulation",
    "follow the trajectory of the maximum compression plane .",
    "varying the impact velocities while keeping its normal component constant , we observed that the crack pattern remains the same in agreement with recent experimental and theoretical findings @xcite .",
    "our analyses showed the existence of a critical value of the impact velocity , at which the oblique cracks reach the outer surface of the disc opposite to the impact point .",
    "the critical velocity separates two regimes of the break - up process , _ i.e. _ below the critical point only a damage cone is formed at the impact site _",
    "( damage ) _ , cleaving of the particle occurs at the critical point , while above the critical velocity the disc breaks into several pieces _",
    "( fragmentation)_. in the limit of very high impact velocities , the disc suffers complete disintegration into many small fragments .",
    "however , this shattered phase is slowly approached since the damage ratio and the number of fragments increase logarithmically with the impact speed .",
    "the critical behavior proved to be independent of the impact angle , it solely depends on the normal component of the impact velocity .",
    "studying the average fragment size revealed that the critical value of the specific energy increases with the size of the disc .",
    "this implies in practical cases that a higher energy density is required to break a particle of larger size .    above the critical point ,",
    "the mass distribution @xmath23 of fragments was found to obey the gates - gaudin - schuhmann distribution ( power law ) with an exponent close to @xmath24 .",
    "the power law functional form occurs at the critical point and remains unchanged in a broad interval of the impact velocity independent of the system size and of the impact angle .",
    "however , in the shattered phase attained in the limit of very high impact velocities , the fragment mass distribution tends to an exponential form .",
    "the results are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental findings on the fragmentation of plate - like objects @xcite .    in applications like mineral processing , a fragment , formed with a certain velocity ,",
