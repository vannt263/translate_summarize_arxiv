    "irradiation of matter constitutes a key tool in physics , chemistry , and biology , for analyzing structural and dynamical properties of atoms , molecules , clusters and bulk material .",
    "lasers offer here an especially flexible and powerful instrument which has been widely exploited , especially during the last decades with the enormous technological progress reached in the manipulation of laser light @xcite .",
    "we dispose now of a broad choice of laser intensities , frequencies , pulse lengths , and pulse shapes .",
    "collisions with charged projectiles @xcite are also used as sources of short electromagnetic pulses .",
    "however , they often require access to dedicated facilities .",
    "radiation damage is the other side of irradiation studies and it is of high current interest , for example in connection with biological tissues ( `` human - controlled '' as in a medical context or `` natural '' when referring to earth or space radiations ) @xcite .",
    "there are also other interesting domains of application .",
    "a typical example is the case of the irradiation of materials ( especially insulators ) with applications to nuclear waste management .",
    "the field is rather unexplored from the microscopic dynamical point of view and any possibility of treating irradiation scenarios on large systems would be here of invaluable help @xcite . in both above examples , though , the lack of understanding of microscopic mechanisms calls for dedicated studies on prototype , finite systems .",
    "let us cite as an example the detailed studies of irradiation of molecules of biological interest coated by a finite and well known number of water molecules @xcite .",
    "the study of the irradiation of finite molecular systems and clusters is thus not only of interest for basic science but also for a wide range of practical applications .    in all cases , the immediate electronic response of the irradiated system plays a key role as the doorway to all subsequent dynamical scenarios .",
    "a basic feature is here the optical response corresponding to electronic oscillations @xcite .",
    "it delivers a first overview of the coupling between irradiation and matter in a large variety of dynamical situations , from gentle to strong perturbations @xcite .",
    "optical response related to photo - absorption is the leading signal in the case of gentle perturbations .",
    "it has been explored in great detail for a large variety of electronic systems , from bulk down to atoms . for the case of stronger perturbations , further response channels , especially ionization ,",
    "become highly relevant @xcite .",
    "still , the optical response spectrum , which characterizes the structural coupling of the system to light , provides a highly valuable information on any ensuing response mechanism , especially on ionization pattern .",
    "a typical example here is the case of resonant ionization occurring when the laser frequency comes close to an eigenfrequency of the system @xcite .    equally important in energetic irradiation processes",
    "is electron transport , particularly electron emission . as typical examples",
    ", one can cite the many studies on irradiation of clusters by short and intense laser pulses @xcite , providing invaluable information especially through energy ( photo - electron spectra , pes @xcite ) and , more recently , angle - resolved @xcite distributions of emitted electrons ( photoelectron angular distributions , pad ) . electron emission can also change the resonant ionization conditions in the course of time evolution which , in turn , influences back again the optical response , making the whole scenario extremely rich @xcite .",
    "secondary electrons in dna damage @xcite also provide a remarkable example where a microscopic understanding of irradiation damage in biological systems will only be achieved when including such complex non - linear electronic effects",
    ". a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is highly desirable , as this example is of great practical interest , especially in relation to oncology @xcite .",
    "the analysis and understanding of electronic emission from a finite system is thus a key issue in a wide range of physical , chemical and biological processes .",
    "electrons are usually the first constituents to respond to an electromagnetic pulse .",
    "strong excitations lead to immediate ionization of the system , often with dramatic long - time effects as , e.g. , dissociation or coulomb explosion @xcite .",
    "it implies electronic transport and possible indirect effects on neighboring species .",
    "a typical example of indirect effects is provided by dissociative electron attachment ( dea ) in biological systems @xcite where electrons emitted somewhere else are attached to a target biological molecule which , in turn , leads to the break up of the latter .",
    "emitted electrons may also provide valuable insight into reaction pathways when properly tracked .",
    "typical examples are here pes and pad .",
    "moreover , time - resolved ( tr ) pes and pad have been recorded in molecules @xcite and more recently in clusters , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "electrons are thus leading players at all stages of an excitation of a system subject to an external electromagnetic perturbation ( i.e. an irradiation ) .",
    "they are the first to respond at short time scales and distribute then the excitation more or less quickly to other degrees of freedom .",
    "they are finally useful probes along the whole dynamical process , especially when emitted from the system and properly recorded .",
    "analyzing the characteristics of emission properties of clusters and molecules is thus at the core of the understanding of irradiation processes .",
    "the numerous new experimental developments in analysis of electronic emission ( pes , pad ) now allow an ever improving detailed access to electron dynamics in irradiated species . in turn , a theoretical description of these highly involved dynamical scenarios calls for dedicated modeling .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide an overview of the theoretical description of observables from electron emission on the basis of the well established theoretical framework of time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite .",
    "this will be done with a view on applications , as far as possible in direct relation to ongoing experiments . before going into the details , we will in this introductory section briefly",
    "remind the reader the typical systems ( and associated scales ) that we aim at describing .",
    "it is also of relevance to address here basic properties of laser pulses as presently accessible experimentally .      in order to provide a basis for the forthcoming discussions , we shortly present here a few typical systems we shall consider in the following",
    "this will be the occasion to remind typical scales associated to these systems , especially in terms of times and energies .",
    "[ fig : systems ] provides four examples of systems computed with the tools described in secs .",
    "[ sec : theo ] , [ sec : sic_stat ] and [ sec : sic_optresp ] .",
    "they cover several different binding types and properties .",
    "( upper left ) , the buckminster fullerene c@xmath0 ( upper right ) , the carbon chain c@xmath1 ( lower left ) , and the covalent molecule h@xmath2o ( lower right ) . for each panel : top row  : ionic structures ( all plotted at the same scale ) and single particle energies of the valence electrons whose number is indicated ; bottom row  : corresponding optical response . for c@xmath1 ,",
    "the transverse spectrum is multiplied by 20 to ease the comparison with the longitudinal response .",
    "the vertical dashes indicate the position of the ionization potential in each case .",
    "[ fig : systems ] ]    the figure shows single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "energies , optical response and ionic structure .",
    "the four presented systems are @xmath3 as an example of a simple metal cluster , c@xmath0 for its outstanding properties and many applications , h@xmath2o as a prototype of a covalent molecule , and c@xmath1 as a simple carbon chain , which displays interesting optical properties .",
    "let us analyze each system separately to extract typical properties .",
    "we start with the @xmath3 cluster ( upper left block in fig .  [",
    "fig : systems ] ) which is a medium size alkaline cluster .",
    "it contains 40 valence electrons forming an electronic shell closure .",
    "this leads to a particularly abundant / stable species .",
    "energies span an energy range of order 2.6  ev and the ionization potential ( ip ) is of order 5.3  ev .",
    "such values are typical of alkaline clusters .",
    "the optical response displays a pronounced collective , essentially single , peak around 2.6  ev .",
    "this is called the mie surface plasmon and it is a typical mode for simple metal clusters . in larger clusters , the density of s.p .",
    "states grows , which leads to more landau fragmentation and somewhat broadens the plasmon peak .",
    "the mie plasmon frequency is related to a typical time scale of order 1.5 fs , again a characteristic time scale for simple metals .",
    "ionic time scales ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : systems ] ) are more sensitive to the actual material due to the largely differing atomic weight . in na clusters , vibrational modes typically lie in the 10 mev range and are associated to ionic motion in the 100 fs range .",
    "the second example is c@xmath0 ( upper right block ) with 240 valence electrons ( 4 per c atom ) .",
    "energies now ranges in a span of about 17.3  ev , much wider than in na .",
    "the ip is 7.6  ev .",
    "the deeper binding and broader span of energies is typical of carbon , and more generally of organic systems with a covalent binding . due to the high symmetry close to sphericity",
    ", the optical response exhibits the same behavior in all spatial directions .",
    "it has , however , a more complex structure than in @xmath4 .",
    "one can identify two prominent features , a strong resonance peak just below the ip and a much broadened peak centered around 20 ev .",
    "the latter part of the optical response lies well above the ip , whence its highly fragmented structure .",
    "it is considered to represent the mie surface plasmon in c@xmath0 .",
    "the energies are higher and thus the associated time scales much smaller than in na , typically well sub - fs .",
    "vibration energies typically lie in the 40 - 200 mev range with associated time scales of order 20 - 100 fs .",
    "the case of the small carbon chain c@xmath1 ( lower left block ) is complementing c@xmath0 in the sense that it has the same binding type , but a different geometry and thus different optical response .",
    "energies span of the 20 valence electrons is of order 14 ev , and the ip of order 9.9  ev .",
    "these values are of the same order of magnitude for larger chains . according to the linear geometry of the chain , the optical response shows a dominant resonance peak along the longitudinal direction at a frequency of 6.4  ev .",
    "the transverse modes are suppressed by at least one order of magnitude ( mind that transverse strengths have been multiplied by a factor of 20 to allow a better graphical comparison with the longitudinal modes ) and are significantly fragmented .",
    "there are three main peaks  : one at the same energy as the longitudinal plasmon peak , and two other ones at higher energies near the ip energy .",
    "the all dominant longitudinal mode lies well below the ip , a feature common to all carbon chains .",
    "associated time scales are now typically ranging from sub - fs to fs .",
    "ionic vibration energies lie again in the 0.15  ev range with associated time scales of order 27.6  fs .",
    "we finally discuss the case of the prototypical water molecule h@xmath2o ( lower right block ) which has 8 active valence electrons in our calculations ( 6 for o and 1 per each h ) .",
    "energy span is now with 16  ev even larger than in c@xmath0 , in spite of the much smaller number of electrons .",
    "the ip is of order 15.1 ev .",
    "such large ip s are typical of covalent systems of small to moderate size . the optical response , as well",
    ", is typical of covalent molecules with its highly fragmented structure above the ip , and some isolated low energy peaks below the ip .",
    "associated time scales lie well below fs .",
    "ionic vibrations are more energetic than in other systems because of the especially light h species and the strong covalent binding between h and o. the o - h ionic vibration energy is about 0.5  ev with associated period of 8.3  fs .",
    "all in all , the four above examples point out the diversity and richness of the various systems nowadays accessible to both experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "the various cases also show that the range of energy and time scales to be investigated is rather large from attosecond to several fs for electrons , and from fs to ps for ions .",
    "in addition , the optical spectra exhibit different pattern .",
    "specific for metals is the especially well marked mie surface plasmon with simple scaling properties with size @xcite .",
    "the case of covalent systems is more involved with basically no simple scaling properties , but nevertheless some generic trends .",
    "optical spectra are generally much more fragmented below and even more so above ip .",
    "pure carbon systems contain besides covalent binding a fraction of metallic binding which produces also plasmon structures amongst the highly fragmented spectrum .",
    "optical response is the key to understanding the coupling of the system to laser light , at least in the frequency - dominated regime ( see secs .",
    "[ sec : lasers ] and [ sec : mecha ] ) .",
    "this will constitute a mostly used tool of investigation of dynamical scenarios in the following discussions . before introducing the actual observables which can be attained that way",
    ", we will briefly discuss present days capabilities of lasers and the description of the electromagnetic fields they deliver .",
    "this aspect is addressed in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : lasers ] .",
    "cluster dynamics requires excitation of the cluster formerly resting in its ground state . in this paper , we will exclusively addess excitation by electromagnetic fields , predominantly by laser pulses and in a few cases by short pulses from collisions with highly charged ions .",
    "the corresponding excitation mechanisms are shortly explained in this section .",
    "thereby , we focus on laser properties and finally address ion collisions in a short paragrph .      laser science has experienced impressive progress during the last few decades @xcite .",
    "the versatility of laser pulses has increased remarkably , thus allowing one to shape a wide range of dynamical scenarios in the course of irradiation processes .",
    "we briefly remind here key quantities of the laser pulses we are going to use in the following . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall work in the dipole approximation which requires that the irradiated system is much smaller than the laser wavelength @xmath5 .",
    "in practice , the dipole approximation is well justified in the optical domain ( @xmath6 m ) for systems of nm size .",
    "it may become questionable for xuv photons and very large clusters in which field variations _ inside _",
    "the system itself should be accounted for .",
    "but we shall not consider such cases here . in the non - relativistic regime ,",
    "linearly polarized laser pulses acting on atoms , molecules or clusters can then be described as a homogeneous time - dependent electric field of the form @xmath7 in this expression , @xmath8 denotes the ( linear ) polarization , @xmath9 is the peak field strength , @xmath10 is the photon frequency , and @xmath11 is some phase shift , usually assumed to be zero . finally @xmath12 is the pulse envelop .",
    "the peak laser intensity is @xmath13 ( @xmath14 being velocity of light in vacuum ) usually expressed in w/@xmath15 .",
    "the net yield in a laser pulse is often characterized by the fluence @xmath16 , where the latter time @xmath17 stands for the full width at half maximum of the pulse .",
    "this allows one to compare the energy impact of laser pulses with different durations .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we keep in the present discussion a fixed value of @xmath10 but the latter quantity can also be made time - dependent ( `` chirped '' ) which can induce interesting effects @xcite .",
    "one may also render the phase @xmath18 time - dependent , which could produce interesting phenomena .",
    "we shall not discuss these aspects here .",
    "the laser polarization is usually taken linear but there also exists experiments / calculations using circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "again , we shall not discuss much such cases in the following and thus recur to a linear polarization for the present discussion .",
    "the laser pulse envelop can be varied in a large range .",
    "most flexible , and most widely used , are optical lasers with pulse lengths from nano - seconds down to atto - seconds @xcite .",
    "free electron lasers ( fel ) @xcite are yet on their way to comparable flexibility , with present pulse lengths down to 20 fs .",
    "it should also be noted that the actual shape of @xmath12 is not exactly known experimentally . in many situations , the actual pulse of interest",
    "is built upon a ( hopefully harmless ) background of a long , low intensity , pulse .",
    "moreover , the peak intensity has a spatial variation decreasing towards the edges of the pulse .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when assigning the observed signal to the laser pulse characteristics .",
    "ignoring background , experimental short laser pulses have a pulse profile of gaussian type . the theoretical situation is simpler as the pulse profile can be exactly specified .",
    "the gaussian profile is theoretically not welcome since it never fully vanishes and requires unnecessarily long computation times to cover the pulse sufficiently well .",
    "therefore , we mostly use for computations a @xmath19 pulse  : @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands here for the heaviside function .",
    "this pulse is limited to a finite time interval @xmath22 $ ] , but soft enough to deliver a clean frequency spectrum .",
    "it can be simply characterized by its fwhm which is in this case @xmath23 .",
    "note that the fwhm of the intensity @xmath24 , which is proportional to the square of the field @xmath25 , is rather @xmath26 .",
    "the pulse maximum occurs at @xmath27 .",
    "note that the sin@xmath28 profile is written here for the laser field amplitude , which means that the time profile of the intensity time has a sin@xmath29 shape .",
    "thus far , we have discussed simple one - peak pulses .",
    "more flexibility is conceivable .",
    "the next important tool are dual pulses as used in pump - and - probe experiments in which the laser irradiation is performed in two steps .",
    "we shall illustrate such cases at several places below .    in practice",
    ", the effect of the laser field will be accounted for in our calculations as an external potential @xmath30 which delivers a time - dependent perturbation . in the long wavelength limit ,",
    "the electric field is homogeneous and delivers the potential  : @xmath31 where @xmath12 is the time profile usually taken according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cos2 ] ) .",
    "this is , in fact , the laser field in space gauge .",
    "equivalently , one can use the velocity gauge for which the laser field is described by the interaction operator  : @xmath32 the rules of gauge transformation relate time profiles and wave functions by  : @xmath33 }    \\quad .",
    "\\label{eq : gaugepsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both gauges are fully equivalent .",
    "which one is to be preferred is a matter of the actual numerical scheme .",
    "most observables are not even sensitive to gauge .",
    "an exception is the evaluation of photoelectron spectra where the phase of the wave function plays a role . in this case",
    ", one has to consider gauges carefully .",
    "this will be addressed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : observ_theo ] .      as pointed out above , all laser parameters can be tuned in rather large ranges .",
    "the point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : laser - regimes ] which displays typical regions of interest in the intensity - frequency plane .     and",
    "photon frequency @xmath34 .",
    "the dashed diagonal line represents frequency - intensity combinations with constant keldysh parameter @xmath35 , see text for details .",
    "this line characterizes the transition from photon - dominated to field - dominated regime for an assumed ip of a few ev .",
    "the blocks to the right side indicate typical frequency ranges as labeled .",
    "the block below the plot indicates typical atomic field strengths related to given laser intensities .",
    "[ fig : laser - regimes ] ]    one can notice the enormous large intensity range of optical lasers .",
    "but the range of available conditions is also dramatically extended by fel , which exist for photons in the ir , vuv and x - ray regime . also indicated outside the axes are corresponding regions of relevance in atoms and molecules in terms of energy / frequency and field / intensity . the lowest frequencies in the deep ir are associated with molecular vibrations , while the range around visible light belongs to the dynamics of valence electrons and core electrons move at much higher frequencies in x - ray regime .",
    "the gray box below the plot indicates typical atomic and molecular field strengths in terms of an equivalent laser intensity .",
    "laser characteristics have to be considered in relation to the electronic response .",
    "this is usually quantified via the ponderomotive potential @xmath36 and the associated keldysh parameter @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath36 represents the electron kinetic energy ( averaged over one photon cycle ) of a freely oscillating electron ( pure quiver motion , no drift velocity ) in a laser field . at peak laser intensity",
    ", it reads  : @xmath38\\,(\\lambda_\\mathrm{las}[{\\rm \\mu m}])^2    \\quad , \\label{eq_u_pond}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the photon wavelength .",
    "the other aspect concerns the electronic binding in the system , which can be quantified by the ionization potential ( ip ) with associated energy @xmath40 .",
    "what counts is the relation between @xmath40 an @xmath36 , quantified by the keldysh parameter @xcite  : @xmath41 the value @xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : laser - regimes ] in the case @xmath43 ev ) separates two regimes . for @xmath44 , direct ionization ( over barrier or tunneling ) prevails .",
    "this regime is dominated by laser intensity and not so much by laser frequency ( field - dominated regime ) . for @xmath45 ,",
    "emission proceeds through multi - photon ionization in a regime of weak perturbations . there",
    ", the results sensitively depend on laser frequency ( photon- or frequency - dominated regime ) .",
    "there is an alternative excitation mechanism by collisions with charged projectiles .",
    "we shall also marginally consider a few examples of collisions with fast ions and thus comment briefly about this tool here .",
    "experiments with charged , fast ions often require access to large scale facilities .",
    "thus there are much less experiments with irradiation by charged projectiles than by the more easily accessible and versatile lasers .",
    "although collisions with charged particles also provide a strong electromagnetic perturbation ( often in form of a short pulse as soon as the projectile velocity is large enough ) , the characteristics of the perturbing field are significantly different from those delivered by a laser pulse .",
    "while lasers provide ( up to details ) an electromagnetic field with a well defined frequency band ( basically the laser frequency ) , collisions with charged projectiles deliver a perturbation covering a very broad band of frequencies , the broader the shorter the pulse .",
    "this delivers useful , complementing information to that attained from lasers .",
    "it is important to note that collisions with charged projectiles also concern a wide range of potential applications of irradiation dynamics , especially in relation to radiation damage and applications thereof .",
    "the present review concentrates on laser excitations .",
    "nevertheless , we shall discuss a few cases with high energy projectiles . for them",
    ", the delivered electromagnetic perturbation can be modeled as an instantaneous boost ( @xmath46 ) at the initial time of the simulation .",
    "this is the way we shall treat this case in the following ( see in particular sec .",
    "[ sec : projectile ] ) .",
    "electronic emission can be analyzed at various levels of sophistication , starting from fully integrated quantities ( total ionization ) down to energy - resolved ( photo - electron spectra , pes ) and angle - resolved ( photo - angular distribution , pad ) quantities .",
    "time is also a key quantity as ionization signals can be followed in time , leading to time - resolved ( tr ) results .",
    "we briefly describe in this section the various types of observables experimentally accessible , starting from the simplest one , that is the total ionization , to the most elaborate ones ( tr - pes and pad ) . in terms of cross sections , this means that we go from integrated ones to single - differential and even double - differential ones , all possibly time - resolved . before discussing these various observables ,",
    "we briefly introduce key mechanisms of ionization , again focusing the discussion on laser induced ionization .",
    "basic ionization mechanisms are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ioni_mecha ] .",
    "we start from the simplest case of an atom ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : ioni_mecha ] ) to introduce two basic ionization mechanisms .",
    "the first one corresponds to a vertical excitation of a bound electron by absorption of one or several ( @xmath47 ) photons ( multi - photon ionization or mpi ) .",
    "this mechanisms may spread over several laser cycles and prevails in weak and moderate fields , usually quoted perturbative regime .",
    "it is associated to large values of the keldysh parameter ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "mpi can promote electrons far above threshold into the continuum and then , it also stands for above threshold ionization ( ati ) . it is a typical mechanism underlying pes and pad measurements in the perturbative regime ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : pes_pad ] ) , providing mostly structural information . the second mechanism illustrated in the case of atoms",
    "is known as optical field ionization ( ofi ) in which the laser acts as a quasi stationary field . for sufficiently large fields , bound",
    "electron can tunnel through the barrier , which means that both barrier height and width ( thus tunnel characteristic time ) allow ionization .",
    "this typically corresponds to moderate values of the keldysh parameter ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the limiting case corresponds to full barrier suppression which can be associated to a critical laser intensity in atoms and which reasonably matches ion appearance intensities in atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the cases of molecules and clusters mix the above considerations with structural properties of the considered systems .",
    "for example , ionization barriers are influenced by neighbouring ions .",
    "a typical example is the case of strong field ionization of diatomic molecules @xcite in which an appropriate internuclear separation leads to lowering or suppression of inner and outer potential barriers , thus leading to enhanced ionization .",
    "the effect was also studied in small clusters @xcite . in the case of large clusters",
    ", one should also mention the separation between inner and outer ionization  @xcite ( see right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : ioni_mecha ] ) , especially important in the case of strong fields .",
    "inner ionization leads to the formation of a set of quasi free electrons constituting sort of a metallic phase .",
    "a final excitation may promote them to the continuum for final escape and then will appear as the total ionization of the system . in most of the cases , we shall discuss in the following we shall not consider strong enough fields to use this concept further . on the other hand , we shall deal with situations where another key ingredient , already mentioned previously , enters the picture .",
    "it concerns the optical response of the irradiated species .",
    "indeed the optical response provides the eigenfrequencies with which a given system does couple to light .",
    "it is thus crucial to integrate it in the discussion of ionization mechanisms , especially in the case of metal clusters in which the plasmon plays a leading role .",
    "the point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ioniz_plasmon ] in the case of a small size sodium cluster na@xmath2 in which the notion of collective plasmon is hard to disentangle from that of a molecular dipole transition .",
    "na@xmath2 possesses two valence electrons .",
    "the mechanism actually remains the same and is thus illustrative of the role of the optical response .",
    "we shall consider plasmon effects on some examples later on ( see in particular sec .",
    "[ sec : basic_ioniz ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nesc_om ] ) .",
    "the dashed curve shows the optical response of the system with a well identified peak at 2.12  ev .",
    "the full curves display the total ionization as a function of laser frequency for a set various laser intensities between @xmath50 and 10@xmath51 w/@xmath15 .",
    "one clearly observes that the ionization signal directly follows the optical response  : attaching a resonance peak leads to enhanced ionization .",
    "the effect is especially visible at low intensity and vanishes with increasing intensities .",
    "we gradually leave the photon - dominated regime ( low intensity ) to reach the field - dominated one . in terms of the keldysh parameter @xmath37 ,",
    "it decreases . in the present test case",
    ", @xmath37 takes values typically between 60 and 250 in the resonance region at low intensity , and reaches values between 2 and 10 in the high intensity case .",
    "the role of resonance peaks is thus crucial here and it should be noted that it does not reduce to the linear regime of excitation .",
    "the total ionization may reach rather large values ( more than half of the available valence electrons ) with increasing laser intensity , and still , the resonance enhancement remains very clear .",
    "this indicates that it will have to be considered whatever the dynamical regime in the following , especially in the case of metals . although the basic enhancement mechanisms remain similar in non - metallic systems ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : basic_ioniz ] ) , resonances are usually less collective and more narrow so that their impact is somewhat different .",
    "still , in many systems such as for example c@xmath0 , one observes a wide bunch of resonances above continuum threshold which very clearly play a key role in the dynamics .",
    "total ionization is the simplest ionization signal one can measure .",
    "still , it already brings interesting information , although not highly detailed , on irradiation mechanisms , as we just discussed in the previous section .",
    "we here illustrate the point on two examples taken from rather original scenarios .",
    "the first case results from an irradiation with extremely large frequencies obtained from a fel , and the second one directly addresses the dynamical evolution of the system in a time - resolved experiment .    fig .",
    "[ fig : examp_fel ] shows time - of - flight ( tof ) spectra of xe clusters irradiated by a fel of frequency around 12 ev @xcite .",
    "the tof gives access to the various charge states attained after irradiation by a laser of intensity @xmath52 w/@xmath15 and pulse length of 100 fs .",
    "the striking point of the figure is the differences observed between the various cluster sizes in terms of attained charge states . while the atomic gas , under the present laser conditions , only allows to access singly charged cations , increasing cluster size allows to progressively reach larger and larger charge states , clearly up to @xmath53 in the largest system of about 3,000 atoms .",
    "the case very nicely illustrates the well known difference between energy absorption by single atoms and clusters , as discussed on many occasions in the past ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the mass peaks are rather broad .",
    "they are furthermore displaced with respect to the calculated flight times indicated by thin vertical lines ( corresponding to the different charge states ) in the top of the figure .",
    "this is an indication that ions have high kinetic energies .",
    "not surprisingly , one can also note that the higher the charge state , the higher the ejection energy ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : examp_fel ] ) and the larger the above mentioned peak displacements .",
    "analysis of total electron emission ( or alternatively of charge state of ionized clusters ) also gives information on the dynamics of the charging process .",
    "one of the most striking early example of such an analysis can be found in a series of experiments led by the rostock group on large size pb clusters @xcite .",
    "these experiments have shown strong enhancement of cluster ionization for optimal pulse durations . more specifically , one observed pb ions with very large state states , much larger than those attained in an atomic gas .",
    "moreover , the attained charge state @xmath54 strongly depends on the pulse duration . the shortest and most intense pulses of duration 150 fs yield ions up to charge state @xmath55 .",
    "when increasing pulse duration , both the maximum charge state and the signal intensity do grow towards a maximum attained for an optimal pulse width of 800 fs .",
    "charge states up to @xmath56 can then be identified . for longer pulses , both maximum @xmath54 and signal decrease again .",
    "although other mechanisms can be envisioned , the efficient charging for a certain pulse duration was in most cases attributed to resonant heating ( plasmon - enhanced ionization ) @xcite .",
    "the above case of ionization enhancement was attained with a single laser pulse and only provides a rather indirect indication on the ionization mechanism .",
    "more detailed investigations were led with dual ( or pump - and - probe ) pulses , especially in the case of ag clusters of about 20000 atoms .",
    "an example of such experiments is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_length ] where one focuses on the yield of ag@xmath57 and the maximum of the emitted electrons as a function of pulse separation .",
    "one observes a strong variation of ionic signal as a function of pulse separation ( delay between pump and probe ) with a clear maximum around 5 ps @xcite .",
    "such a behaviour indicates that cluster activation and enhanced ionization can be clearly disentangled , which is also found in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this again provides an interesting insight the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "there are even clear indications that a sequence of two pulses might constitute an optimal pulse profile for the production of very high charge ions @xcite , provided a proper tuning of pulse parameters . and",
    "pushing again the argument , one can even envision a route for targeted control of the cluster dynamics @xcite .",
    "finally a word on the maximal electron energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_length ] is in place .",
    "the coincidence of high ionization yield and maximal electron energy again points out the leading role of collective excitations , and this in both channels .",
    "this is compatible with other observations @xcite .",
    "the next step in the analysis of electronic emission consists in characterizing the properties of the emitted electrons in terms of kinetic energy and angular distribution .",
    "this leads to photo - electron spectra ( pes ) for the energy analysis and photo - angular distribution ( pad ) for angular signals .",
    "the terms come from laser irradiation but the signals themselves can as well be recorded in any ionization scenario , for example from collisions with highly charged ions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : projectile ] ) .",
    "pes and pad signals turn out to provide extremely rich information , both from a structural and from a dynamical viewpoint .",
    "we briefly discuss their properties in this section and illustrate them on a few examples covering several dynamical situations .",
    "kinetic energies of emitted electrons can be measured in several ways .",
    "tof devices provide here a versatile tool , but this time applied to the electrons themselves ( while they are traditionally used for ions ) . because of the well defined mass to charge ratio for an electron",
    ", the arrival delay directly maps the electron kinetic energy , provided a carefully guiding of the electron flow e.g. , by a magnetic mirror @xcite .",
    "another very interesting technique is provided by photo - imaging spectroscopy , also known as velocity map imaging ( vmi ) .",

    "the observed circles correspond to peaks in the pes ( not shown here ) .",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : exampl_vmi ] is a raw image , while the right one is obtained after some inversion analysis .",
    "an approach such as vmi allows a simultaneous determination of pes together with pad , which is extremely interesting . from the thus combined pes / pad distribution ( double differential , energy- and angle - resolved , cross section )",
    "it is then easy to recover pes or pad separately by proper energy or angular integration .",
    "still , mostly because of signal intensity , the double differential cross section can rarely be used as a whole .",
    "therefore , energy or angular integration usually allow a simpler access to the data .",
    "it is also simpler and usually more quantitative to compare theory to experiments in simpler representations , where rather than the double differential cross section @xmath61 pes / pad , one considers singly differential pes @xmath62 or pad @xmath63 cross sections .",
    "we shall thus explore now in more detail integrated pes and pad .",
    "a pes typically results from a multiphoton ionization ( mpi ) mechanism ( see sec .  [",

    "electrons absorb a certain number of photons to reach the continuum and be emitted .",
    "they can absorb more than the number of photons required to reach the continuum threshold , which leads to copies of the signal ( although much reduced in intensity ) .",

    "these measurements basically provide a structural information on the system . in the present case , the pes exhibits well resolved peaks associated to the single electron states , as indicated in standard spectroscopic notation .",
    "one can note that the degeneracy of the @xmath70 state is split into a series of sub - peaks because of symmetry breaking of the ionic configuration .",
    "such one - photon measurements on anionic clusters were thus already performed in the early 1990 s @xcite .",

    "the figure exhibits several interesting features .",
    "first the comparison between @xmath3 and @xmath73 ( which contains 41 electrons ) very clearly points out the shell closure at 40 electrons with the appearance of one single electron in the 1 g level around 5.2  ev .",

    "to summarize , the above result clearly shows that a trpes provides an extremely rich tool of investigation of details of electron dynamics .",

    "even more so pad bring an invaluable complement to pes , as we shall see in the next section .",

    "the reference direction is given by the laser polarisation axis and angular distributions are thus measured with respect to this axis .",

    "this in particular reduces the angular distribution to a dependence on the angle between the laser polarization axis and the detection angle , because of angular averaging around the polarization axis . for then , in the case of single photon absorption , the cross section takes the simple form : @xmath77 where @xmath21 is the direction of the emitted electron measured with respect to the laser polarisation , @xmath78 is the second order legendre parameter and @xmath79 is known as the anisotropy parameter . in the simple case of one photon processes ,",

    "the pes exhibit two maxima , also visible as rings in panel ( a ) , one at high energy and one at low energy .",
    "the high energy signal is associated to direct emission from the photo - excitation itself .",
    "the low energy component is attributed to thermionic emission in which the original laser energy has been partly equipartitioned between vibronic degrees of freedom of the cluster , prior to electron emission .",
    "the time scale and the typical energies associated to thermoionic emission are thus much larger than the ones associated to direct emission . in the present experiment the typical time scales of thermoionic emission lie in the tens to hundreds of ns , which in that case can be identified experimentally .",

    "the boundaries of the regimes are to be understood as very soft with large zones of overlap between the models because the choice of a method also depends on several aspects ( e.g. , demand on precision , material , time span of simulation ) .",

    "a semi - classical mean - field description is provided by the vlasov equation originally designed for plasma physics @xcite .",
    "this approach ignores quantum effects such as shell structure or tunneling and thus becomes questionable at low energies .",

    "tracing the chain of correlations back to panel ( d ) , we can conclude that the extra ionization directly maps the global ionic radius using the scheme with the remote laser frequency as an `` observer '' .",
    "net ionization thus provides a direct ( time resolved ) analysis of ionic motion , in that case dominated , on the rather short times considered , by radial oscillations .",
    "the actual long term evolution of the system is , in fact , coulomb explosion .",
    "the interesting aspect is that the long path to explosion is accompanied by monopole ( radial ) oscillations which are directly visible in the ionization signal ( actually via the plasmon peak ) .",
    "almost all p&p studies on clusters have used the ionization yield as an observable .",
    "one expects that one could learn more from more detailed observables , particularly from time - resolved pes and pad .",
    "such experiments are , of course , much more complex and still more demanding than the , already intricate , traditional p&p measurements .",
    "nonetheless , first studies in that direction have been published @xcite so far in the regime of hefty excitations .",
    "the field is widely open for further studies in more moderate excitation regimes .",
    "all the p&p studies , including the above example , show that the ionization yield can depend sensitively on the choice of the laser pulse characteristics . as the temporal profile and",
    "all other laser parameters can be tuned in an extremely flexible manner , the question naturally arises whether one could tune laser pulses for maximum yield ( or other desired reaction properties ) .",
    "this is the idea of  optimal control  which is of particular importance in chemistry and molecular physics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "again , the application to large clusters is more involved and allows more strategies to be tracked .",
    "an interesting study using optimal control , e.g. , to trigger the yield of highly charged ag atoms from ag clusters can , nevertheless , be found in @xcite .    while addressing promising future developments of p&p studies , we ought to mention the upcoming availability of attosecond pulses .",
    "these allow p&p studies which resolve features of electronic dynamics .",
    "we will discuss that in the next section [ sec : p&p_ele ] .",
    "electron dynamics can also be analyzed at its own pace if one is able to handle pulses much shorter than typical electronic time scales in the fs regime .",
    "this is nowadays experimentally accessible down to some hundreds of attoseconds , at least in the form of a train of attosecond pulses .",
    "this yields access to details of electronic dynamics subject to electromagnetic perturbations .",
    "early convincing tests were performed in simple atoms such as he and ar @xcite on the basis of a p&p setup involving a uv atto - train on top of an ir field .",
    "it was shown that the total ionization may exhibit marked oscillations as a function of the delay between uv train and ir signals , once the repetition rate of seven attopulses per train is chosen to be half the ir period .",
    "the analysis of these experiments was supported by simple simulations using the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) with a single active electron .",
    "the tdse also served as a basis for further theoretical investigations , either directly @xcite or in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these approaches gave convincing clues on the origin of the modulation of the ionization but so far , no robust many - electron theory is available to explain the observations .",
    "more recently , experiments were generalized to simple molecules with qualitatively similar results as in the atomic case , although with a slightly different combination of ir and uv pulses  @xcite .",
    "the first fully microscopic calculations were performed on this occasion and led to results remarkably compatible with experiments  @xcite .",
    "the actual interpretation of the underlying mechanism is nevertheless , again , to be understood in more detail .",
    "still , the remarkable agreement between theory and experiments is worth being presented and discussed in one test case .",
    "we consider here the n@xmath2 molecule as a test case  @xcite .",

    "is delayed by a variable delay @xmath406 with respect to the ir pulse ( starting at t=0 ) .",
    "both the ir pulse and the apt are linearly polarized .",
    "the individual attopulse shape is again a sin@xmath28 profile ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cos2 ] ) ) of fwhm@xmath407 . a key point of the setup is to fix the time interval between two successive attosecond signals .",
    "we choose here @xmath408 , which is exactly half the ir period .",
    "the amplitude of the apt is further modulated by a gaussian envelop of width such that the total apt duration is about half ( 29 fs ) the total duration of the ir pulse .",
    "this fixes the number @xmath402 of attopulses which is , in this case , 22 .",
    "the peak intensity of the ir pulse is chosen to be @xmath409  w/@xmath15 , while that of the attopulses is , at maximum of the gaussian envelope , @xmath410  w/@xmath15 .",
    "finally , the frequency of the apt lies in the uv domain , @xmath411  ev , so that each individual attopulse contains about 1.5 uv oscillation .",
    "the laser parameters are such that the pure ir pulse does not lead to ionization , while a pure uv train does lead to some ionization through one - photon processes because the ip of n@xmath2 is around 16.3 ev @xmath412 .",
    "the remarkable result of the experiments is that combining the ir and the attopulses leads to a significant enhancement of ionization ( while it only adds 1.58 ev on top of the uv photons already above the continuum ) .",
    "moreover , this enhanced ionization is strongly modulated by the delay @xmath413 .",
    "ionization actually exhibits marked oscillations as a function of delay with a period equal to half the ir period .",
    "maxima of oscillations are attained for delays such that the attopulses are in phase with maxima or minima of the ir pulse , which explains the doubled frequency of ionization maxima as compared to the ir frequency .",

    "indeed , if the deposited energy content is about the same , the higher the ionization , the lower their average kinetic energy . and not surprisingly , the more energetic the emitted electrons , the more aligned the emission along the laser polarization axis and the larger the @xmath79 .",
    "these oscillations of the total ionization perfectly match those observed experimentally .",
    "a comparison with pes and pad has to wait until these quantities are experimentally available .",
    "we finally end this discussion by mentioning recent experimental p&p dynamics which use xuv pulses for both the pump and the probe .",
    "this is at variance with the example discussed above , where the pump is an ir pulse and the xuv probe is constructed from some of its high order harmonics using the so - called rabitt ( reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two - photon transitions ) technique  @xcite . to distinguish the two kinds of p&p ,",
    "one sometimes quotes them as ir - pump - xuv - probe and xuv - pump - xuv - probe experiments respectively .",
    "one type of setup uses a coherent splitting of a xuv light produced by a fel .",
    "for instance , this technique has been successfully applied to small molecules as n@xmath2 and o@xmath2  @xcite , or c@xmath2h@xmath2  @xcite . in these latter examples ,",
    "the xuv frequency is 38  ev , the photon intensity between @xmath419 and @xmath420  w/@xmath15 , and the xuv pulse duration of 30  fs .",
    "the delay time resolution is 1 fs , and the whole delay time can vary over the @xmath421  fs range . the advantage of using xuv light for the pump and the probe is to ionize the species under study by absorption of a few photons , at variance with an ir pulse .",
    "therefore , this p&p setup can follow the induced coulomb explosion at a time scale of a few fs . very recently , some experiments went even further by taking advantage of high harmonic generation from an ir pulse irradiating an atomic gas jet  : the produced xuv attopulses are then separated from the ir pulse , filtered to keep only one pulse which is at the end split into two coherent xuv as pulses .",
    "this brand new technology has been applied in the irradiation of xe atoms  @xcite and the h@xmath2 dimer  @xcite .",
    "the xuv intensities are about @xmath422  w/@xmath15 , their duration about 600  as , their frequency is 14  ev , and the delay time is well below 1 fs .",
    "such an experimental apparatus thus enables to track the coulomb explosion dynamics over the whole reaction path and on a time scale never attained before . in both xuv - xuv p&p experiments , fragment or ion yields",

    "no electronic observable has been measured so far .",
    "there are also very few real - time calculations of such a dynamics  @xcite .",
    "they employ a time - dependent schrdinger equation of the full electronic and nuclear wave function ( note however that only vibronic modes  no rotational mode  are considered in these calculations ) . for light atoms as those in h@xmath2 , a quantal description of the nuclei",
    "is probably compulsory .",
    "the necessity of such a fully quantal treatment is more questionable for heavier atoms , as in n@xmath2 .",
    "anyway , the computational cost of such calculations becoming too prohibitive for larger covalent systems , this probably calls for a classical treatment of the ions , even if h@xmath423 nuclei come into play .",

    "although both results have similar pattern , the tdlda distribution is much more anisotropic than the experimental one .",
    "this reflects once again the fact that tdlda underestimates electron - electron collisions which are the doorway to thermal effects .",
    "it is thus interesting to test whether thermal effects might explain the observed discrepancy . for a simple estimate ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we assume that the residual electronic excitation energy which is found to be 1.8 ev is fully thermalized .",
    "thermal energy is later on converted into a thermal electronic emission .",

    "this leads to the curve labeled  direct@xmath568thermal \" in fig .",
    "[ fig : pad_ati ] , which now agrees fairly well with the experimental curve .",

    "the most interesting feature is the shape of the emission profile . in the vlasov calculations",
    ", ionization grows very quickly in the early stages and levels off once the laser pulse is switched off .",
    "note that the huge ionization blue - shifts the plasmon resonance such that the case @xmath572  ev becomes off - resonant and subsequently emission is terminated after the pulse ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : basic_ioniz ] ) .",
    "the vuu results look much different .",
    "emission is suppressed in early stages .",
    "this is overcompensated by a steadily continuing emission later on .",
    "the pattern are very similar for all three laser frequencies , while the amplitude of the effect ( and the relative values of vlasov and vuu ionization at early times ) depends sensitively on frequency .",
    "this is a long known effect that field amplification by the plasmon resonance naturally leads to enhanced emission @xcite in tdlda and correspondingly in vlasov @xcite .",
    "vuu shows the same resonant behavior , but modulates the time profile of emission .",
    "it reduces ionization in early stages because electron - electron collisions remove energy from the direct emission channel , and it enhances emission in later stages by releasing gently the stored energy .",
    "the analysis of pes is of limited interest in vlasov and vuu as at low energy neither can identify electron single particle energies because of their semi - classical nature .",

    "a complication arises when comparing pad with measurements , since clusters or molecules in gas phase have an undefined orientation .",
    "they represent , in fact , an isotropic ensemble of orientations .",
    "theoretical calculations need thus to be complemented by orientation averaging . for the one - photon domain ,",
    "we have worked out a compact formula which can live with only six reference orientations to be computed .",
    "multi - photon processes require direct integration where we find that one can obtain reliable results with typically 1836 integration points , depending on the symmetry of the cluster .",
    "pes are computed by recording the phase oscillations of outgoing wave functions close to the onset of the absorbing bounds , and by finally fourier transforming the temporal oscillations to the energy domain .",
    "special care has to be taken to cope with strong laser pulses .",
    "they may modify the phase of the wave functions at the sampling point .",
    "fortunately , this effect can be evaluated analytically and allows us to derive a phase correction , thus rendering the scheme for computing pes reliable up to rather large laser intensities ( typically @xmath670@xmath671w/@xmath15 .",
    "altogether , we have thus at hand powerful and versatile tools to simulate ionization dynamics and to evaluate the observables deduced thereof . in the following , we will briefly summarize the results for each observable separately .",
    "the simple signal of total ionization is already useful when combined with systematics .",
    "for example , the frequency dependence of ionization maps the underlying dipole response .",
    "ionization becomes the key signal in pump and probe ( p&p ) scenarios which constitute a well established tool for a time - resolved measurement of ionic motion .",
    "clusters are rather complex systems where the motion of single ions is hard to track .",
    "p&p measurements at least enable to identify global properties of the ionic configuration , as radius and quadrupole deformation , which is already very useful information in studies of coulomb explosion of clusters . on a first example",
    ", we could show how the now upcoming attosecond pulses allow time - resolved analysis at electronic pace .",
    "the main body of the paper dealt with results on pes and pad . combined",
    "pes / pad as obtained from velocity map imaging ( vmi ) contain a very rich amount of information , but are usually hard to appreciate as such .",
    "the energy- or angular - integrated versions thereof , delivering pad and pes , are better suited for detailed analysis and comparisons between experiments and theory .",
    "a pes in a strictly one - photon domain delivers a map of the clusters s.p . spectrum . in experiments ,",
    "this was limited previously to negatively charge cluster anions due to a low ionization potential .",
    "the availability of coherent high - frequency light sources now allows one to employ the one - photon analysis for neutral clusters and even cations .",
    "multi - photon processes make pes more involved and richer . in the low - intensity regime , one can identify multiple copies of the s.p .",
    "spectra separated by the photon frequency .",
    "but pes goes beyond just mapping s.p .",
    "it delivers a picture of the whole dynamical processes .",
    "we have illustrated that by working out the impact of plasmon resonances which can directly drop its signatures in the pes themselves .",
    "increasing intensity produces more ionization which coulomb shifts the s.p .",
    "states gradually downwards , thus broadening the peaks in the pes .",
    "this eventually leads to totally smoothed pes with straightforward exponential decrease .",
    "this kind of pattern suggests at first glance an interpretation as purely thermal electron emission .",
    "a closer inspection from energetic considerations and tdlda simulations reveals that it can not be fully a thermal process .",
    "we probably encounter a mixed situation .",
    "direct emission still prevails and electronic re - collisions add first thermal effects to the picture .",
    "we have also seen that pes alone can not distinguish unambiguously between direct and thermal emission .",
    "the unavoidable orientation averaging of pad wipes out many details which were contained in before averaging .",
    "fortunately , there remains a lot of useful information .",
    "orientation averaged pad in the one - photon regime can be characterized by one single parameter , the anisotropy @xmath79 .",
    "a systematic survey of @xmath79 and its frequency dependence revealed that pad are extremely sensitive to every detail of the modeling .",
    "this holds even more so for state - resolved anisotropies @xmath494 ( where @xmath65 stands for a s.p .",
    "state or degenerated group thereof ) .",
    "no compromises are allowed .",
    "one must invoke the full machinery of tdlda+sic and a careful description of the detailed ionic structure to have a chance for a relevant description .",
    "for example , the @xmath672 computed with smooth jellium background shows marked fluctuations which disappear when ionic background is used",
    ". however , there remains one remarkable exception in the low - frequency tail of @xmath672 for the loosely bound anion @xmath431 .",
    "this shows a deep dip towards one - photon emission threshold and it does so independent of the model for the ionic background . in the multi - photon domain ,",
    "a pad provides crucial information which helps to distinguish direct from thermal emission . this was nicely visible in the combined pes / pad of c@xmath0 where one could associate uniquely the region of low kinetic energy with thermal electrons while higher kinetic energies show clear sign of direct emission with the pad being forward / backward dominated .",
    "the collection of results presented in this review has several open ends which call for further development and investigation .",
    "we briefly quote a few of them which we consider to be important next steps .",
    "it was already mentioned above that it becomes increasingly possible to extend time - resolved analysis to the attosecond domain .",
    "theoretical studies are required to explore the huge space of new possibilities and to find out the most promising experimental conditions .",
    "a further interesting perspective emerges if combining time - resolved analysis with pes and pad .",
    "this enables , e.g. , to track the branching between direct and thermal emission in the course of time .",
    "first studies in this direction are very promising .",
    "the discussion of pes and pad left as a yet unsolved problem the distinction between direct and thermal processes in electron emission .",
    "this calls for a proper theoretical modeling of electron - electron collisions ( dynamical electron correlations ) and subsequent dissipation effects .",
    "two promising development lines for such an extended tdlda have been presented , that is the relaxation time approach which models dissipation phenomenologically and a stochastic mean field model which describes the system as an ensemble of mean - field states incorporating the electron - electron collisions as stochastic jumps between these states .",
    "the results summarized above prove that observables from electron emission are an extremely powerful tool to analyze irradiation processes on clusters and molecules .",
    "they allowed one in the past to reveal many interesting aspects of structure and dynamics of these systems .",
    "the future directions sketched in the previous paragraph show that we are not nearly at an end of the investigations . the field remains lively and highly interesting and challenging for the future .",

    "<S> there are various ways to analyze the dynamical response of clusters and molecules to electromagnetic perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> particularly rich information can be obtained from measuring the properties of electrons emitted in the course of the excitation dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis of electron signals covers observables such as total ionization , photo - electron spectra ( pes ) , photoelectron angular distributions ( pad ) , and ideally combined pes / pad . </S>",
    "<S> it has a long history in molecular physics and was increasingly used in cluster physics as well . </S>",
    "<S> recent progress in the design of new light sources ( high intensity , high frequency , ultra short pulses ) opens new possibilities for measurements and thus has renewed the interest on these observables , especially for the analysis of various dynamical scenarios , well beyond a simple access to electronic density of states . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , has motivated many theoretical investigations of the dynamics of electronic emission for molecules and clusters up to such a complex and interesting system as c@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical tool of choice is here time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) propagated in real time and on a spatial grid , and augmented by a self - interaction correction ( sic ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a pertinent , robust , and efficient description of electronic emission including the detailed pattern of pes and pad . </S>",
    "<S> a direct comparison between experiments and well founded elaborate microscopic theories is thus readily possible , at variance with more demanding observables such as for example fragmentation or dissociation cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to describe the theoretical tools developed on the basis of real - time and real - space tddft and to address in a realistic manner the analysis of electronic emission following irradiation of clusters and molecules by various laser pulses . after a general introduction </S>",
    "<S> , we shall present in a second part the available experimental results motivating such studies , starting from the simplest total ionization signals to the more elaborate pes and pad , possibly combining them and/or resolving them in time . </S>",
    "<S> this experimental discussion will be complemented in a third part by a presentation of available theoretical tools focusing on tddft and detailing the methods used to address ionization observables . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also discuss the shortcomings of standard versions of tddft , especially what concerns the sic problem , and show how to improve formally and practically the theory on that aspect . </S>",
    "<S> a long fourth part will be devoted to representative results . </S>",
    "<S> we shall illustrate the use of total ionization in pump and probe scenarios with fs lasers for tracking ionic dynamics in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> more challenging from the experimental point of view is pump and probe setups using attosecond pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the effort there is more on the capability to define proper signals to be measured / computed at such a short time scale . </S>",
    "<S> tddft analysis provides here a valuable tool in the search for the most efficient observables . </S>",
    "<S> pes and pad will allow one to address more directly electronic dynamics itself by means of fs or ns laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we shall in particular discuss the impact of the dynamical regime in pes and pad . </S>",
    "<S> we shall end this fourth part by addressing the role of temperature in pes and pad . when possible , the results will be directly compared to experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the fifth part of the paper will be devoted to future directions of investigations . from the rich choice of developments , we shall in particular address two aspects . </S>",
    "<S> we shall start to discuss the information content of energy / angular spectra of emitted electrons in case of excitation by swift and highly charged ions rather than lasers . </S>",
    "<S> the second issue concerns the account of dissipative effects in tddft to be able to consider longer laser pulses where the competition between direct electron emission and thermalization is known to play a role as , e.g. , in experiments with c@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> although such questions have been superficially addressed in the simple case of alkaline clusters by means of semi - classical methods , no satisfying quantum formulation , compulsory for most realistic systems , is yet available . </S>",
    "<S> first encouraging results will be presented on that occasion </S>",
