    "millimeter - wave observations of variable and transient astrophysical sources have contributed greatly to our understanding of the processes in these objects , for example through observations of outbursts from active galactic nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ) and the detection of reverse shocks in gamma - ray bursts @xcite . gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows are of particular interest in this band as they often have the peak of their spectra in or near the millimeter range @xcite , with emission lasting over timescales of days to weeks . as grb emission",
    "is expected to be more tightly beamed in gamma rays than at longer wavelengths , burst afterglows not accompanied by detectable gamma ray emission are believed to exist but have not been detected .",
    "the observation of these off - axis sources would provide insight into the jet dynamics and central engine energy budget of grbs @xcite .",
    "in addition , other classes of gamma - dark bursts have been advanced as the solution to a number of astrophysical puzzles , for example the origin of the tev ",
    "pev diffuse neutrino background @xcite",
    ". however , no untriggered millimeter transient searches  which could reveal both these orphan grb afterglows and new , unknown sources  have been conducted to date due to limitations of observing time and field of view .",
    "high - angular - resolution cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) surveys offer a unique opportunity to fill this void and to probe for previously unknown transient sources in the millimeter and submillimeter bands @xcite . to average down instrumental and atmospheric noise ,",
    "a typical ground - based cmb survey will continuously scan the same patch of sky ( tens to thousands of square degrees ) for years .",
    "in addition to providing low - noise maps of the cosmic microwave background , this observation strategy provides a platform for continuous monitoring of the survey region for variable and transient sources in the millimeter band in which the cmb is brightest .",
    "the rapid reobservation cadence of ground - based instruments , typically hours , provides sensitivity to a wide range of possible variability scales , from hours to the years - long periods of the cosmology surveys .",
    "this work describes such a search for transient point sources using the 10-meter south pole telescope ( spt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the spt , we achieve discovery sensitivity of approximately 10  mjy on timescales of days to weeks ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "this depth gives a sensitivity in the upper range of observed grb afterglows from follow - up observations conducted in this band , but well below the brightest observed bursts , which have had fluxes exceeding 70  mjy @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity also compares favorably to previous blind radio surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which have had comparable flux sensitivity to this work but smaller effective sky coverage for week - scale sources and have been conducted at lower frequencies where grb afterglows are much dimmer .",
    "over the period of this study ( 2012 april  2013 may ) , the polarization - sensitive sptpol receiver was used to observe a 100 square degree field centered at ra 23^h^30^m^ and declination -55@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] ) .",
    "this field is well out of the galactic plane , giving sensitivity predominantly to extragalactic sources .",
    "observations were conducted continuously at approximately hourly intervals except for the period from 2012 november 10 to 2013 march 26 , in which observations of this field were not made to avoid sun contamination and to allow for telescope maintenance .",
    "the sptpol receiver consists of an array of 1536 transition edge sensor bolometers , with 360 operating at 95  ghz and 1176 at 150  ghz .",
    "each of the receiver s pixels consists of a pair of bolometers sensitive to perpendicular linear polarizations at one of these frequencies @xcite .",
    "the 95  ghz detectors have wider beams ( 1.8 arcmin ) than the 150  ghz detectors ( 1.1 arcmin ) . for unresolved sources with comparable fluxes at both frequencies , such as grb afterglows ,",
    "the change in beam width as well as differing detector performance , the larger number of 150  ghz detectors , and changes in the atmospheric noise level result in 1.7 times better sensitivity at 150  ghz .",
    "much steeper spectra than expected for grbs ",
    "steeper than @xmath3would be required for better sensitivity at 95  ghz . in this work ,",
    "we focus on sources with less steeply falling or rising spectra and use the 150  ghz band as our primary detection channel , examining the 95  ghz data only for additional information about any detected candidate sources .",
    "the cryogenic system used to maintain the sptpol detectors at sub - kelvin temperatures is a closed cycle three - stage ( @xmath4he-@xmath5he-@xmath5he ) refrigerator .",
    "the refrigerator s cooling cycle is not continuous and needs to be recycled periodically for recondensation of helium .",
    "the recycling causes approximately 8 hours of lost observation time every 36 hours as the helium is recondensed , the detectors retuned , and the instrument recalibrated .",
    "as the transient search conducted here is focused on emission lasting days or longer , we combine all field observations within one of these 36-hour cycles into a single map for analysis using an inverse - variance - weighted average .",
    "because the instrument calibration and detector operating points are maintained for this period , this also results in the combination of maps with similar calibration and noise properties .",
    "the resulting 150  ghz cycle - length maps have a median @xmath6 depth of 5.0  mjy .",
    "these cycle - length combined maps we then filter , as described in the following sections , and compare to the average map over the full season . using a multi - epoch likelihood method , we examine these maps for sources present for periods of time significantly shorter than the one - year survey period .",
    "atmospheric fluctuations produce large - angular - scale signals in the data that vary from observation to observation and must be filtered to remove false transient sources . here",
    "we combine two approaches for the removal of these signals : filtering time - ordered detector data against large - scale variations and a matched filter applied to the maps to increase sensitivity to point sources . during observations ,",
    "the telescope scans back and forth across the observing field in azimuth ( which is equivalent to right ascension at the south pole ) at a speed of @xmath7 and then steps in elevation ( equivalent to declination ) .",
    "the telescope repeats this scanning and stepping over the declination range of the survey field . as a first step in the filtering of large - scale map structures produced by atmospheric fluctuations , we subtract a seventh - order polynomial fit to the data from each @xmath8 azimuthal scan .",
    "this filtering removes most atmospheric structure at degree and larger scales while having little effect on sensitivity to point sources at arcminute scales .",
    "the time - ordered detector data are then low - pass filtered at a frequency corresponding to the 0.25 arcmin pixels in the final maps to prevent aliasing higher frequency features . after filtering ,",
    "the data from each detector is combined into a map using an equal - area projection .",
    "both polarizations are summed and the contributions from each detector weighted by the inverse of its variance in the 0.8 - 3 hz band , roughly where we expect the signals of interest to most sptpol analyses to lie .    as time - independent features ( the cmb , steady point sources , etc . ) difference out in our analysis ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : flaresearch ] ) , our map filtering is built to discriminate point sources from the time - varying features of the sky : atmospheric fluctuations , instrument noise , and variable compact objects .",
    "we treat the first two of these using the matched filter method described in @xcite and @xcite to downweight remaining large - scale structures in the map in favor of the instrument beam scale features produced by point sources .",
    "the matched filter is constructed primarily from measurements of the instrument beam and data - driven estimates of the instrument and atmospheric noise power spectra .",
    "although not required for this search , we also include the time - independent cmb power spectrum as a noise term in the matched filter for consistency with the previous spt point source results in @xcite and @xcite . as the typical angular scale of cmb fluctuations is much larger than the instrument beam , filtering the cmb removes little of the point source signal and thus does not significantly degrade our analysis .",
    "many of the brightest point sources at millimeter wavelengths exhibit substantial time variability  up to a factor of two for some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "our observing field contains @xmath9 point sources detected with fluxes above 2.5  mjy ( @xmath10 for the year of data used here ) . to prevent false detections from variability in these sources , we mask areas of the map within 5 arcmin of known steady point sources in this field from earlier spt results @xcite with quiescent fluxes above 5  mjy , well below our threshold for detection of shorter - duration transient sources ( sec .  [",
    "sec : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "very bright sources produce detectable filtering wings at larger distances that alias fluctuations in the source intensity . as such",
    ", we extend the masked area of sources above 50  mjy to a 10 arcmin radius from the source .",
    "this leaves a final survey array of @xmath11 .",
    "these sources were also masked in the computation of the polynomials subtracted from the time - ordered detector data .",
    "overall calibration of our data is based on observations of the galactic h  ii region rcw38 for flux calibration and coarse pointing , along with planet observations and agn for measurements of instrument beams and pointing .",
    "we use nearly identical observation quality criteria as in @xcite .",
    "these criteria remove observations of the field with elevated or non - gaussian noise as well as periods with abnormally low observing efficiency due , for example , to telescope maintenance or hardware problems . in addition , we use a different time discretization that causes a further 1% loss of observing time .",
    "this leaves 253 days of sensitivity to week - scale emitting sources .      to identify transient sources",
    ", we used a multi - epoch method following @xcite sensitive to sources on all time scales from the map discretization ( @xmath12 hours ) to a few months .",
    "this method identifies sources by fitting a variable - width flare template to the inferred point source flux at a particular position as a function of time .",
    "we then use the likelihood ratio of this fit to the null hypothesis ( zero peak flux ) as a discriminant to identify potential sources . for each point on a grid covering the survey area with resolution of half an arcminute ( approximately half our beam size ) , we minimize the following over the time series at that point :    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the difference between each pixel and that pixel in the full - period average map , @xmath15 is the estimated noise level at that map position and time , @xmath16 is a penalty function that will be described later , and @xmath17 is a gaussian template for the source flux as a function of time :    @xmath18    the functional form of this template was chosen as a generic search function containing a variable - width flare that allows the numerically robust minimization of equation   and provides good statistical power for a wide variety of potential flare shapes @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of this gaussian .",
    "the sensitivity to astrophysical sources identified using this method depends weakly , typically at the percent level , on the actual emission profile .",
    "this can be seen intuitively by considering the limiting cases of low and high signal - to - noise . in the low signal - to - noise regime , at the detection threshold",
    ", the data would be sufficient to detect a source but not to determine the shape of the emission .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that there can not be a large change in the likelihood , our detection figure of merit , from variations in the functional form of the emission profile @xmath20 .",
    "when signal - to - noise is very high , we do expect potentially large changes in the value of the likelihood from shape mismatches .",
    "however , as our detection threshold ( section  [ sec : sensitivity ] ) is fairly low , we do not expect changes in the likelihood from shape differences relative to our template to meaningfully change our detection efficiency .",
    "the major impact of shape mismatches instead is to cause the parameter values @xmath21 to reflect only effective parameters of our template rather than unbiased estimates of the peak flux , start time , or emission width .",
    "as genuine astrophysical sources are not expected to have a gaussian profile , the parameters of equation   should thus be regarded in general as nuisance parameters .    from equation",
    ", we form a test statistic ( ts ) from the ratio of the best - fit likelihood with all parameters free to the best - fit likelihood where the estimated peak flux is fixed to @xmath22 and all other parameters are free ( here carets denote best - fit quantities ) :    @xmath23    if the penalty function @xmath24 , this test statistic has a maximization bias to short estimated flare widths ( @xmath19 ) as a result of the look - elsewhere effect",
    ". for short flares , there are more potential uncorrelated points in time for the flare to start ( @xmath25 ) , effectively widening the search space and thus the effective trials factor .",
    "this increases the false discovery rate ( fdr ) at small @xmath19 .",
    "following @xcite , we flatten the fdr by applying a penalty term @xmath26 that approximates a marginalization of the likelihood over a uniform prior in @xmath25 and cancels this effect .    for the evaluation of @xmath16 , @xmath19",
    "is bounded above by the full length of the survey to prevent runaway values of equation   when evaluating the null hypothesis ( @xmath22 ) , in which @xmath26 is the only variable term .",
    "@xmath19 is otherwise constrained only by a non - negativity requirement .",
    "we compute statistical significance from values of ts by using the noise - dominated low - significance parts of the ts distribution and by using negative fluctuations , which are unphysical as source emission , as a signal - free control sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tshist ] ) . both distributions , with the exception of the object described in section [ sec : source ] ,",
    "are well described in their high - significance region by the expected @xmath27 distribution . above the highest observed noise fluctuation",

    ", this is turn is equal to the false detection rate associated with the most significant point in the survey .    as a further cross - check",
    ", we ran @xmath30 noise - only simulations , equivalent to approximately 1500 years of observations on this field .",

    "the blue line indicates the flux at which 50% of sources would be detectable ; the filled region shows the range between the points at which 10% of sources and at which 90% of sources would be detectable .",
    "very long flares , approaching the length of the full dataset , are indistinguishable from continuously - emitting point sources , reducing sensitivity slightly relative to @xmath31 on the right .",
    "this figure assumes an arbitrary gaussian flare profile  alternatives ( boxcar functions , scaled copies of the grb030329 100  ghz lightcurve from @xcite ) differ at the few percent level . sources were injected starting at times uniformly distributed through the observing period within 2 days of an observation ( this removes the summer maintenance period , leaving 253 days of effective live time ) and uniformly throughout the 80.5 deg@xmath32 masked survey area . ]",
    "given the one - year length of the survey , observing band , and flux sensitivity ( fig .",

    "grb afterglow emission is believed to be dominated by synchrotron processes , with significant self - absorption at low frequencies .",
    "as the afterglow ages , it gradually becomes optically thin and the self - absorption point ( @xmath33 ) moves to progressively lower frequencies .",
    "this break frequency marks the junction between the rising optically thick part of the spectrum ( @xmath34 ) and the falling optically thin synchrotron regime ( @xmath35 ) and thus corresponds to the peak of the spectrum . in the early stages of the afterglow",
    ", the burst will brighten with time at observing frequencies @xmath36 below @xmath33 as @xmath33 moves to lower frequencies faster than the burst cools , decreasing the suppression from self - absorption at @xmath36 .",
    "once @xmath37 , the flux will begin to decrease with time , following the cooling of the burst .",
    "this competition between cooling and self - absorption results in an earlier peak emission time ( when @xmath38 ) as @xmath36 rises , corresponding to both brighter peak emission and tighter beaming angles . for @xmath39  ghz ,",
    "typical peak times are a few days to a week after the burst rather than the several weeks typical of 1.4  ghz observations , with much higher peak fluxes @xcite .",
    "this peak emission time , and the observed length of emission , may be correlated with the peak observed flux both due to the physics of the expanding jet and due to cosmological effects such as time dilation at high redshift @xcite . although the tighter beaming angles at high frequencies suppress the number of observable bursts , the higher fluxes result in a net increase in the number of detectable objects for a survey with a fixed limiting flux density as @xmath36 increases into the millimeter band @xcite .",
    "the approach described in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] gives effective @xmath6 map noise of 23  mjy on the relevant week timescale for on - axis grb afterglows .",
    "for the longer ( month - scale ) emission expected from very off - axis and population - three bursts @xcite , we achieve lower effective noise in the 12  mjy range at very long timescales ( @xmath40 6 months ) , however , sensitivity rapidly fades as the source duration becomes comparable to the survey period and it becomes indistinguishable from a steady source .    over the number of map pixels and time range of the survey ,",

    "[ fig : gausssens ] ) , depending on emission length and position in the field .",
    "this sensitivity is well below the brightest grbs followed up in this band , which had peak fluxes above 70  mjy ( e.g. grb030329 from @xcite ) , but well above the average observed burst , which has a peak flux of @xmath43  mjy . using the catalog in @xcite ,",

    "this fit prefers a non - zero total population largely because of the candidate object .",
    "the results are dominated by the high - significance tail above the noise fluctuation background and so @xmath85 is poorly constrained given a constant number of above - threshold sources .",
    "a profile likelihood calculation leaving the @xmath85 power - law index @xmath86 as a free parameter provides a source density above 20  mjy of @xmath89 deg@xmath90 year@xmath91 and rejects zero at @xmath50 .",

    "other predictions , such as in @xcite , which consider different source populations ( magnetars , on - axis grbs , tidal disruption events ) , give expected source densities an order of magnitude lower .    as this is",
    "the first transient survey in the millimeter band , comparison of these results to previous surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) is a complex and model - dependent task .",
    "the highest frequency of these @xcite was conducted at 5  ghz , a factor of 30 below our primary observing band , and correspondingly was focused on somewhat different sources .",
    "the most similar previous results in terms of science goals , in @xcite and @xcite , focus on grb afterglows , though at lower frequencies ( 1.4  ghz ) .",
    "these searches used two epochs of nvss and first data several years apart to identify the isotropic emission from a grb afterglow after the ejecta become subrelativistic .",
    "this occurs late in the history of the burst , with the peak time occurring six months or more after the burst and emission lasting for a period of a year @xcite , a timescale to which the 1-year sptpol survey described here has extremely limited or no sensitivity ( sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] ) will allow a direct comparison of the results from @xcite to millimeter - band data on similar timescales and corresponding limits on the allowed spectral index of sources like the possible detection in @xcite .",
    "the more indirect comparison  connecting constraints on late - time isotropic afterglows to the constraints we place on early partially beamed bursts  is highly theoretically uncertain for the reasons described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] and an interesting topic for future modelling work .    while a direct comparison in terms of the year or more emission period implied by the @xcite sub - relativistic afterglow model is impossible as a result of the length of our survey , the two - epoch strategy used sets only an upper bound on the length of their detected sources . as such , we are at least free to compare results for week - scale sources and address whether the candidate source in @xcite could be a similar object to that described in sec .  [",
    "sec : source ] . the similar effective sky coverage ( @xmath97  deg@xmath32 ) for week - scale emission at fluxes @xmath98  mjy suggests that any such sources detectable by both surveys at threshold must have a very flat broadband spectral index .",
    "a reasonable synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath99 ) would make a week - long source detectable by @xcite an order of magnitude below threshold here .",
    "conversely , even a very slowly rising spectrum such as expected for grb afterglows near peak ( @xmath100 ) would make an sptpol - detectable source a factor of four below threshold for the first / nvss data ; a steeper self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath101 ) would make such sources completely invisible at 1.4 ghz .",
    "this requirement for an extremely flat spectrum over two orders of magnitude in frequency makes it very unlikely that the candidate from @xcite is related to the candidate in sec .",
    "[ sec : source ] .",
    "the population of bright ( @xmath102  mjy ) grb afterglows is dominated , both at 1  ghz and 150  ghz , by nearly on - axis self - absorbed bursts with rising spectra @xcite , which would make the majority of nvss / first - detectable afterglows visible to sptpol given sufficiently long observation times .",
    "future sptpol data over longer time periods will thus allow a much more direct comparison to the results from @xcite .",
    "observations with sptpol have provided the first untriggered view of the transient millimeter sky , with sensitivity approaching that required to test current models of off - axis grbs and other sources .",
    "one candidate object was observed , but it remains unclear whether the observed emission is a statistical fluctuation .",
    "its properties are intriguing and qualitatively consistent with some expectations for a grb afterglow , although there is some internal tension between the polarization data and the spectrum and the statistical significance of the detection is too low to completely rule out a fluctuation .    the forthcoming spt-3 g receiver , scheduled for deployment over the 2016/2017 austral summer @xcite , will greatly improve the capabilities of this survey and provide much - enhanced sensitivity to any objects with the same properties ( peak flux , duration , spectrum ) as the candidate from this work .",
    "spt-3 g is planned to survey an area of 2500 deg@xmath3225 times the area covered here  in three frequency bands ( 90 , 150 , and 220  ghz ) to approximately the same depth as in this article , ultimately probing source densities in the 1020  mjy regime to below @xmath103 deg@xmath90 year@xmath91 . at this level",
    ", multiple detections are expected annually from the off - axis bursts modeled in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "even a non - observation with spt-3 g will thus place constraints on the shock dynamics and energy budget of the unknown grb progenitors .",
    "most important , this sensitivity is well below the source density implied by the candidate source here .",
    "if it was a statistical fluctuation , spt-3 g will be able to rule out a transient source population at the best - fit level in fig .",
    "[ fig : popstats ] .",
    "conversely , if it was indeed a real source , spt-3 g would see dozens of sources annually at our best - fit source density , independent of @xmath86 , and begin to characterize the population from which it arose .",
    "in addition , a 500 deg@xmath32 survey using sptpol is currently in progress with a planned conclusion at the end of 2016 . for week - scale sources ,",
    "this survey will cover an effective sky area 20 times larger than covered here , albeit with map noise approximately two times greater .",
    "this prevents the direct exploration of the population of 10  mjy sources possible with spt-3 g , but will provide complementary information to what is available in this work . for a source population with @xmath85 index @xmath104 such as predicted for all source classes in @xcite , including orphan grb afterglows , the number of detections will increase by trading depth for sky area .    extending the observing period from one year to the four years of the 500 square degree survey will also allow better discrimination between dim steady sources and long transients .",
    "orphan grb afterglows in particular , as well as population-3 grbs , may have durations of months . with only one year of data ,",
    "such objects are largely indistinguishable from steady sources , reducing the sensitivity of this analysis despite the low noise levels afforded by long integration times . as a result",
