    "the recent development of high - frequency data bases makes it possible to study the intermittent market dynamics on time scales of less than a day @xcite-@xcite .    using foreign exchange ( fx ) intraday data , mller et al .",
    "@xcite showed that there is a net flow of information from long to short timescales , i.e. , the behavior of long - term traders influences the behavior of short - term traders .",
    "motivated by this hierarchical structure , ghashghaie et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed analogies between the market dynamics and hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , and claimed that the information cascade in time hierarchy exists in a fx market , which corresponds to the energy cascade in space hierarchy in a three - dimensional turbulent flow .",
    "these studies have stimulated further investigations on similarities and differences in statistical properties of the fluctuations in the economic data and turbulence @xcite-@xcite .",
    "differences have also emerged .",
    "mantegra and stanley @xcite and arneodo et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the time evolution , or equivalently the power spectrum is different for the price difference ( nearly white spectrum ) and the velocity difference ( @xmath2 spectrum , i.e. , @xmath3-law for the spectrum of the velocity ) .",
    "moreover , from a parallel analysis of the price change data with time delay and the velocity difference data with time delay ( equivalent to the velocity difference data with spatial separation under the taylor hypothesis @xcite ) , it was shown that the time evolution of the second moment and the shape of the probability density function ( pdf ) , i.e. , the deviation from gaussian pdf are different in these two stochastic processes @xcite . on the other hand , non - gaussian character in fully developed turbulence",
    "@xcite has been linked with the nonextensive statistical physics @xcite-@xcite .    as dynamical foundation of nonextensive statistics ,",
    "beck recently proposed a new model describing hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite .",
    "the velocity difference @xmath4 of two points in a turbulent flow with the spatial separation @xmath5 is described by brownian motion ( an overdamped langevin equation @xcite ) in a power - law potential . assuming a @xmath0-distribution for the inverse temperature",
    ", he obtained a tsallis distribution @xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "however , if we take into account the almost uncorrelated behavior of the price change @xcite-@xcite , the picture by means of the brownian motion seems to be more appropriate for the market data rather than turbulence . moreover , the description by the langevin equation is able to relate the pdf of the price change to that of the volatility , a quantity known as a measure of the risk in the market",
    ". thus we applied the model to fx market dynamics by employing the correspondence by ghashghaie et al .",
    "we substitute the fx price difference @xmath6 with the time delay @xmath7 for the velocity difference @xmath4 with the spatial separation @xmath5 .",

    "the volatility is often estimated by the standard deviation of the price change in an appropriate time window @xcite . employing this definition , we express the volatility in terms of the local standard deviation of the price change @xmath50 as      here",

    "[ x2 ] .    the average ` temperature ' in the market @xmath59 increases with @xmath7 since @xmath60 is positive .",
    "( we obtained the scaling exponent @xcite @xmath61 , which is larger than 2/3 obtained for turbulence . ) in contrast , the fluctuation of the temperature increases with decreasing @xmath7 because the variance of the inverse temperature is proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "the smaller values of @xmath30 imply the stronger intermittency which occurs in small time scales .",
    "the intermittent character in the price change can be seen as a fat tail of @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ tsallis ] . also in fig .",
    "[ x2 ] , the peak of @xmath55 shifts to smaller @xmath23 as @xmath7 decreases ( from d to a in fig .",
    "[ x2 ] ) , which means relatively high temperatures are realized more frequently in short time scales .    it should be noted that the pdf in eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) with @xmath19 reduces to student s @xmath63-distribution @xcite , which has often been used to characterize the fat tails @xcite .",
    "when @xmath19 , there is no adjustable parameter because @xmath30 is decided from eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) .",
    "the fx market system is then subject to a restoring force linear to the price change and the volatility is proportional to the temperature .",
    "we have found that the pdfs of @xmath20 and @xmath23 reproduce , although very roughly , the olsen and associates data points even if @xmath57 is fixed at @xmath19 .",
    "however , adjusting the parameter @xmath57 improved the line shape of @xmath48 in a range close to @xmath64 .",
    "the data points in fig .",
    "[ tsallis ] exhibit a cusp at @xmath64 for large time scales @xmath7 , which implies a singularity of the second derivative of the pdf at @xmath64 .",
    "the larger reduction of @xmath57 from unity leads to the stronger singularity .",
    "( note that the factor @xmath65 arises from @xmath66 . )",
    "thus the better fitting for large @xmath7 was obtained from a reduced value of @xmath57 .",
    "the trend of decrease in @xmath57 with increasing @xmath7 was observed for the turbulent flow @xcite as well .",
    "however , the deviation from @xmath67 is much smaller than the present case and the cusp is invisible .",
    "ghashghaie et al .",
    "@xcite have used a model for turbulence by castaing et al .",
    "@xcite , in which a log - normal distribution has been assumed for the local standard deviation of the price change .",
    "the present model reduces to the model by ghashghaie et al . if the stochastic process given in eq .",
    "( [ dzdt ] ) is assumed with @xmath67 ( the local variance of @xmath20 is then proportional to @xmath11 ) and the @xmath1-distribution for @xmath23 ( the inverse of the local variance of @xmath20 ) is replaced by the log - normal distribution for @xmath68 ( the local standard deviation of @xmath20 ) .",
    "although no analytic expression like eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) for @xmath48 is obtained , a similar qualitative explanation can be applied to their model : the volatility ( or equivalently , the square root of the temperature ) fluctuates slowly with a log - normal distribution , and the smaller time scale corresponds to the larger variance of the logarithm of the volatility .",
    "( the variance is denoted by @xmath69 in ref .",
    "however , the power - law behavior of the tail of the volatility distribution @xcite can be better described by the @xmath1-distribution for the inverse of the variance .",
    "we have proposed the stochastic process described by eq .",
    "( [ dzdt ] ) for fx market dynamics in small time scales .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ dzdt ] ) is the simplest stochastic process which can realize the thermal equilibrium distribution , eq .",
    "( [ pzbeta ] ) in the power - law potential .",
    "more realistic and more complicated processes that assure convergence to eq .",
    "( [ pzbeta ] ) at local temperatures might be possible . mantegna and stanley",
    "have proposed a different stochastic model of the price change , which is described by a truncated levy flight ( tlf ) @xcite .",
    "the model , yielding approximately a stable distribution , well reproduces the self - similar property of pdf at different time scales : @xmath70 1 min to 1 000 min .",
    "however , the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath71 characterizing the stable distribution fluctuate for larger ( monthly ) time scales @xcite , where @xmath71 gives a measure of the volatility .",
    "in other words , the ultimate distribution ( let us denote it @xmath72 ) should be obtained , like eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) , from the weighted average over these parameters .",
    "a difference between @xmath72 and @xmath48 is that @xmath72 has no cusp at @xmath64 : @xmath73 for @xmath74 , whereas @xmath75 , and the present fx date set indeed exhibits a cusp as seen in fig .",
    "[ tsallis ] .",
    "finally , a fundamental question has been left open : how to derive theoretically the increasing trend of fat - tailed character with decreasing time scale , i.e. , @xmath7-dependence of the parameters ( @xmath76 ) . an attempt to derive the non - gaussian fat - tailed character in small time scales",
    "was made by friedlich et al .",
    "recently @xcite .",
    "they derived a multiplicative langevin equation from a fokker - planck equation and showed that the equation becomes more multiplicative and hence fat - tailed as @xmath7 decreases . clarifying the relation between their multiplicative langevin equation and eq .",
    "( [ dzdt ] ) ( the latter being rather simple although including the fluctuating temperature ) should be important as well as interesting .",
