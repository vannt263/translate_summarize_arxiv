    "the @xmath0cdm framework offers a simple description of the properties of our universe with a very small number of free parameters , reproducing remarkably well a wealth of high quality observations ( allowing to reach a precision below 5% for most of the parameters with present - day data@xcite ) .",
    "more than fifteen years after the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe@xcite , the @xmath0cdm model remains the current standard model in cosmology .",
    "however , since the dark contents of the universe remain unidentified , alternative models still deserve to be investigated .",
    "a notable alternative to the @xmath0cdm model is the so - called power law cosmology , where the scale factor @xmath5 evolves proportionally to a power of the proper time : @xmath6 .",
    "this class of models may for instance emerge when classical fields couple to spacetime curvature@xcite . predicted abundances by primordial nucleosynthesis",
    "seem problematic @xcite , but the confrontation to low - redshift data , type ia supernovae ( snia ) and the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , may not be as problematic@xcite , although there is some controversy in the literature concerning the ability of the power law cosmology to fit these data @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore interesting to compare the performance of the standard @xmath0cdm model to those of power law models taking into account standard cosmological probes .    among these alternative models to @xmath0cdm stands the so - called @xmath7 cosmology@xcite , where @xmath8 is the hubble radius and @xmath9 the hubble parameter",
    "this model , which is characterized by a total equation of state @xmath10 , turns out to be a particular case of the power law cosmology with exponent equal to 1 . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", there is also some controversy on the motivation for such models@xcite . as in the general power law case",
    ", some studies claimed that this model is ruled out by observations@xcite , while some others claimed that @xmath7 is able to fit the data even better than @xmath0cdm@xcite , and that it can explain a large amount of physics like the epoch of reionization@xcite , the high - redshift quasars@xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) multipole alignment@xcite or the constancy of the cluster gas mass fraction@xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we examine how the @xmath0cdm and power law models compare to the main cosmological probes , using robust model selection criteria . in this work , with respect to previous ones , we allow some evolution with redshift for the snia luminosity ( considering an evolution in the distance modulus as a function of the redshift ) and consider the implication of the cmb properties , which certainly represents the most impressive success of the standard model , and use it in combination with the above mentioned low - redshift probes .    in section 2 we briefly describe the models under study . in section 3",
    "we present the statistical tool used to determine the ability of a model to fit the data and the selection criteria used for this work . in section 4 we describe the two low - redshift probes used in the study : snia and bao , as well as the data samples used and the parameters that enter into the comparison . in section 5",
    "we present the high - redshift probe used : cmb , and we describe the approach followed in this work in order to use data coming from this probe .",
    "we present the results obtained in section 6 and conclude in section 7 .",
    "in this section we present the three different models studied in this work : the @xmath0cdm model , the power law cosmology and the @xmath7 cosmology .",
    "the flat @xmath0cdm model is the current standard model in cosmology thanks to its adequacy with the main cosmological data , i.e. snia@xcite , bao@xcite and cmb@xcite .",
    "this model assumes a robertson - walker metric and friedmann - lematre dynamics leading to the comoving angular diameter distance , @xmath11 , and friedmann - lematre equation :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the hubble constant and @xmath14 is the energy density parameter of the fluid @xmath15 .",
    "the universe flatness is already captured by the last term in eq.([eq2 ] ) .",
    "we compute the radiation contribution as@xcite :    @xmath16\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 , the photon contribution , is given by :    @xmath18    and fixing @xmath19@xcite , the effective number of neutrino - like relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath20@xcite and @xmath21@xcite , the temperature of the cmb today .",
    "notice that we only fix @xmath13 for the radiation contribution .",
    "it is left free in the rest of the work .",
    "the main assumption in power law cosmologies is that the scale factor evolves as a power of the proper time :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the power of the model and @xmath24 .",
    "this provides us with the friedmann - lematre equation :    @xmath25    which leads to :    @xmath26    notice that an expanding universe requires @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath7 cosmology states that the hubble radius @xmath8 is proportional to time , so we can write @xmath28 for this model . for a flat universe",
    "this leads to the comoving angular diameter distance and friedmann - lematre equation :    @xmath29    fig.[fig000 ] shows the variation with redshift of the hubble parameter @xmath30 for these three models .",
    "the matter and radiation contributions have been fixed to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , while the hubble constant has been fixed to @xmath33 , for illustrative purposes .",
    "cdm , @xmath7 cosmology and two different power law cosmologies .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath13 have been fixed to @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , for illustrative purposes . ]",
    "in this section we review the statistical tools used to quantify the goodness of fit and to compare the models under study .      to quantify the capacity of a model to fit the data",
    "we minimize the common @xmath36 function :    @xmath37    using the migrad application from the ` iminuit ` python package , designed for finding the minimum value of a multi - parameter function and analyze the shape of the function around the minimum .",
    "this code is the python implementation of the former minuit fortran code@xcite . in eq.([eqchi2 ] ) , @xmath38 stands for the model prediction , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 hold for the observables and their inverse covariance matrix , respectively .",
    "we then compute the probability that a larger value for the @xmath36 could occur for a fit with @xmath41 degrees of freedom , where @xmath42 is the number of data points and @xmath43 is the number of free parameters of the model :    @xmath44    with @xmath45 the upper incomplete gamma function and @xmath46 the complete gamma function .    obtaining a probability close to 1 implies that it is very likely to get larger @xmath36 values , meaning that the model fits correctly ( possibly too well ) the data . on the other hand , obtaining a small probability",
    "indicates that the model does not provide a good fit to the data .",
    "when combining probes , we minimize the @xmath36 function given by the sum of individual @xmath36 functions , i.e. , we assume that the probes are statistically independent .",
    "it is important to notice that eq.([prob ] ) is only valid when we work with @xmath42 data points coming from @xmath42 independent random variables with gaussian distributions .",
    "however , in this work we consider the correlation within probes ; thus , the data points come from non independent gaussian random variables . in order to check the impact of correlations on this probability we compute the histogram of @xmath36 through monte carlo simulations with and without correlations .",
    "first of all , we fix the fiducial model to @xmath47 in order to save computation time , since we do not need then to fit a certain model each time we compute a @xmath36 .",
    "notice that there are no parameters then ; thus : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we then generate the dataset from a @xmath42-dimensional gaussian distribution centered at @xmath50 and with the corresponding covariance matrix @xmath51 for the probes used . when neglecting correlations we consider only the diagonal terms of @xmath51 . finally , we compute the @xmath36 using eq.([eqchi2 ] ) and we repeat @xmath52 times to obtain the histograms shown in fig.[fig4bis ] .    in the left plot we use the covariance matrix for bao and cmb data .",
    "we can clearly observe that the histogram obtained with correlations ( green ) is completely consistent with the histogram obtained neglecting any correlation ( purple ) .",
    "moreover , both of them are consistent with the analytic distribution ( thick black solid line ) , which is given by the derivative of eq.([prob ] ) with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "notice that we have neglected here the number of free parameters of the model because we have fixed the fiducial model to @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that the three distributions are completely consistent implies that the correlations in the bao+cmb covariance matrix do not effect eq.([prob ] ) and we can safely use it . in the right plot of fig.[fig4bis ] we have the equivalent results using the covariance matrix for snia , bao and cmb .",
    "as before , the three distributions are completely consistent , implying that we can use eq.([prob ] ) with these correlations .",
    "a particularity in this case is that the covariance matrix is not completely independent of the cosmology . as will be discussed in the following sections , the covariance matrix depends on two nuisance parameters . in order to correctly predict the effect of these correlations , we need to consider these nuisance parameters and determine them when fitting each model under study to the @xmath52 mock data samples .",
    "however , we keep the fiducial @xmath47 model , due to the fact that the two snia nuisance parameters remain very close to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as can be seen in table[table1 ] .          in this work",
    "we consider two widely used criteria to compare the models under study : the akaike information criterion ( aic)@xcite and the bayesian information criterion ( bic)@xcite . both account for the fact that a model with fewer parameters is generally preferable to a more complex model if both of them fit the data equally well .",
    "the aic is built from information theory .",
    "rather than having a simple measure of the direct distance between two models ( kullback - leibler distance and @xmath55 denotes the information lost when @xmath55 is used to approximate @xmath56 . as a heuristic interpretation ,",
    "the kullback - leibler information is the distance from @xmath55 to @xmath56 . ] ) , the aic provides us with an estimate of the expected , relative distance between the fitted model and the unknown true mechanism that actually generated the observed data .",
    "we must be aware that the aic is useful in selecting the best model in the set of tested models ; however , if all the models are very poor , the aic will still give us the one estimated to be the best .",
    "this is why we previously compute the probability of a model to correctly fit the data ( see eq.([prob ] ) ) .",
    "given the minimum of the @xmath36 ( @xmath57 ) and the number of free parameters of the model @xmath43 , the aic is given by :    @xmath58    the aic may perform poorly if there are too many parameters compared to the size of the sample@xcite . in this case , a second - order variant of the aic can be used , the so - called aicc@xcite :    @xmath59    where @xmath42 is the number of data points .",
    "an extensive presentation and discussion of the aic and its variations can be found in@xcite .",
    "the bic is one of the most used criterion from the so - called dimension - consistent criteria ( see @xcite for a review of many of these criteria ) . it was derived in a bayesian context with equal prior probability on each model and minimal priors on the parameters , given the model .",
    "it is given by :    @xmath60    both the aicc and the bic strongly depend on the size of the sample . in order to compare different models we use the exponential of the differences @xmath61aicc/2 ( @xmath61bic/2 ) , where @xmath61aicc=@xmath62-aicc ( i d .",
    "for the bic ) , since the exponential can be interpreted as the relative probability that the corresponding model minimizes the estimated information loss with respect to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "given that the aic ( aicc ) and the bic can both be derived as either frequentist or bayesian procedures , what fundamentally distinguishes them is their different philosophy , including the nature of their target models .",
    "thus , the choice of the criterion depends on their performance under realistic conditions .",
    "a comparison of these two criteria is outside the scope of this paper ( see@xcite for an extended and detailed comparison ) , so we just provide the results for both of them . in general ,",
    "though , the bic penalizes extra parameters more severely than the aic .",
    "it is important to notice that when comparing two models with the same data sample and the same number of parameters ( e.g. @xmath0cdm and power law with snia data : @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , @xmath61aic and @xmath61bic basically reduce to @xmath65 .",
    "this leads to the same numerical values for exp@xmath66 and exp@xmath67 for @xmath0cdm and power law models in table[table2 ] .",
    "in this section we describe the two low - redshift cosmological probes and the corresponding data sets used to compare the different models presented .",
    "type ia supernovae are considered as standardizable candles useful to measure cosmological distances .",
    "although measurements of cmb and large scale structure can constrain the matter content of the universe and the dark energy equation of state parameter , snia are important for breaking degeneracies and achieve precise cosmological measurements .",
    "the observable used in snia measurements is the so - called distance modulus :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the luminosity distance . notice that we have defined the distance modulus in such a way that it is independent of the @xmath13 parameter , which is degenerate with the snia absolute magnitude .",
    "distance estimation with snia is based on empirical observation that these events form a homogeneous class whose variability can be characterized by two parameters@xcite : the time stretching of the light - curve ( @xmath70 ) and the supernova color at maximum brightness ( @xmath51 ) . in this work",
    "we use the joint light - curve analysis ( jla ) for snia from @xcite .",
    "they assume that supernovae with identical color , shape and galactic environment have on average the same intrinsic luminosity for all redshifts .",
    "this yields the distance modulus : @xmath71 where @xmath72 corresponds to the observed peak magnitude in the rest - frame b band and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are nuisance parameters in the distance estimate .",
    "the @xmath75 nuisance parameter is given by the step function : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are nuisance parameters , in order to take into account the dependence on host galaxy properties .",
    "concerning the errors and correlations on the measurements we use the covariance matrix provided by @xcite where they consider the contribution from error propagation of light - curve fit uncertainties ( statistical contribution ) and the contribution of seven sources of systematic uncertainty : the calibration , the light - curve model , the bias correction , the mass step , the dust extinction , the peculiar velocities and the contamination of non type ia supernovae .",
    "in some specific cases during this work we relax the redshift independence assumption done in @xcite . in order to account for a possible snia evolution with redshift ( caused by some astrophysical procedures , for example . see@xcite for previous studies accounting for snia evolution ) we add an extra nuisance parameter @xmath79 to the distance modulus estimate : @xmath80    when using snia data , the set of nuisance parameters considered is @xmath81 . for @xmath0cdm and the power law cosmology we consider @xmath34 and @xmath23 , respectively , as cosmological parameters .",
    "we consider no cosmological parameters when using snia data with the @xmath7 cosmology .",
    "the baryonic acoustic oscillations are the regular and periodic fluctuations of visible matter density in large - scale structure .",
    "they are characterized by the length of a standard ruler , generally denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "the main observable used in bao measurements is the ratio of the bao distance at low - redshift to this scale @xmath82 . in the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "the bao come from the sound waves propagating in the early universe and the standard ruler @xmath82 is equal to the comoving sound horizon at the redshift of the baryon drag epoch : @xmath83 , @xmath84 . for models differing from the @xmath0cdm model , @xmath82 does not need to coincide with @xmath85@xcite . for the moment , and in order to be as general as possible , we do not delve into the physics governing the sound horizon @xmath82 , so we consider @xmath82 as a free parameter .    the bao are usually assumed to be isotropic . in this case the bao distance scale is given by : @xmath86    more recently it has also been possible to measure radial and transverse clustering separately , allowing for anisotropic bao .",
    "the bao distance scales are then @xmath11 and @xmath87 .    in this work we follow@xcite in combining the measurements of 6dfgs@xcite , sdss ( main galaxy sample)@xcite , boss ( cmass and lowz samples - data release 11)@xcite and boss lyman-@xmath73 forest ( data release 11)@xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we assume that all the measurements are independent , apart from the cmass anisotropic measurements ( correlated with coefficient -0.52 ) and the lyman-@xmath73 forest measurements ( correlated with coefficient -0.48 ) .    according to @xcite ,",
    "when constraining parameters to a high confidence level or claiming that a model is a poor fit to the data , one should take into account that bao observables likelihoods are not gaussian far from the peak . in this work",
    "we follow the same approach and account for this effect by replacing the usual @xmath88 for a gaussian likelihood observable by : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the corresponding detection significance , in units of @xmath91 , of the bao feature .",
    "we consider a detection significance of 2.4@xmath91 for 6dfgs , 2@xmath91 for sdss mgs , 4@xmath91 for boss lowz , 6@xmath91 for boss cmass and 4@xmath91 for boss lyman-@xmath73 forest .    when using bao data , we consider the following set of cosmological parameters : @xmath92 .",
    "the latter two only apply for @xmath0cdm and power law cosmology , respectively .",
    "we do not consider any nuisance parameter .",
    "in this section we present the high - redshift probe used , the cosmic microwave background , and the approach we follow in order to consider this probe in our study , including power law models .",
    "the cmb is an extremely powerful source of information due to the high precision of modern data .",
    "furthermore it represents high redshift data , complementing low - redshift probes . in standard cosmology",
    ", the physics governing the sound horizon at the early universe is that of a baryon - photon plasma in an expanding universe .",
    "the comoving sound horizon at the last scattering redshift is given by : @xmath93 where @xmath94 stands for the redshift of the last scattering and where : @xmath95 with @xmath96 being the baryon density and @xmath97 the photon density .",
    "the observed angular scale of the sound horizon at recombination : @xmath98 then depends on the angular distance to the cmb , a physical quantity sensitive to the expansion history up to @xmath99 and thereby to background history of models@xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath100 roughly corresponds to the position of the first peak of the temperature angular power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "although this represents a reduced fraction of the information , it is well known that reduced parameters capture a large fraction of the information contained in the cmb fluctuations of the angular power spectra@xcite .",
    "we use the value provided by the planck collaboration@xcite : @xmath101 and , in the following , we refer to this information as cmb data .",
    "it has been obtained from planck temperature and low-@xmath102 polarization data .",
    "marginalization over the amplitude of the lensing power spectrum has been performed , since it leads to a more conservative approach .    according to @xcite , the @xmath7 universe assumes the presence of dark energy and radiation in addition to baryonic and dark matter .",
    "the only requirement of this model is to constrain the total equation of state by requiring @xmath10 . following this definition , and extending the idea to the power law cosmology",
    ", we infer that the physics governing the sound horizon at the early universe is the same than for @xmath0cdm , since we are again essentially dealing with a baryon - photon plasma in an expanding universe . for @xmath0cdm",
    ", we use the value provided in@xcite for @xmath103 and we use eq.([oph ] ) for the radiation contribution .",
    "this assumption has already been made in the litterature .",
    "in@xcite , for example , the authors considered the dirac - milne universe ( a matter - antimatter symmetric cosmology ) and kept the same expression for @xmath104 as in the @xmath0cdm case .    for a power law cosmology :    @xmath105    which converges only for @xmath106 ; therefore , there is already a fundamental problem in these theories when describing the early universe .",
    "this divergence also exists for the sound horizon @xmath82 in the bao .",
    "given that the big bang nucleosynthesis already suffers from a problem in the early universe , one might imagine that the physics of the early universe allow to solve this issue , essentially by restoring the standard model in the very early universe , keeping the sound horizon finite .",
    "@xmath82 being now an unknown quantity , we have to obtain its value by fitting it to the data .",
    "we can then develop @xmath104 by :    @xmath107    in@xcite the authors also had to deal with this divergence near the initial singularity .",
    "they opted for putting upper and lower bounds to the integral on physically motivated grounds , while we allow the data to determine @xmath82 and avoid the divergence .",
    "we now need to determine @xmath108 and @xmath94 for all the models . a common definition of the redshift of the cmb is given by the maximum of the visibility function@xcite :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the optical depth@xcite :    @xmath111    with @xmath112 the thomson cross section and @xmath113 the free electron number density .",
    "this definition is well motivated because the visibility function can be understood as the probability of the last photons of the cmb to scatter ; thus , the maximum provides us with the most probable redshift of this last scattering . in order to obtain @xmath113",
    "we calculate the free electron fraction @xmath114 and we further multiply it by the hydrogen number density :    @xmath115\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath116 is the mass of the hydrogen atom and @xmath117 with @xmath118 the helium mass fraction .",
    "the ionization history @xmath119 depends on the expansion rate . in order to obtain it we use the ` recfast++`@xcite code , based on the c version of ` recfast`@xcite , adapting the expansion history to the corresponding one for each model .",
    "this new version includes recombination corrections@xcite and allows to run a dark matter annihilation module@xcite .",
    "it also includes a new ordinary differential equations solver@xcite .",
    "more details about this code can be found in@xcite .",
    "fig.[figxe ] provides a comparison between @xmath114 for the different power law cosmologies and @xmath0cdm .",
    "we have neglected the recombination corrections and dark matter annihilations for simplicity , and because this level of precision in the @xmath114 determination is not needed for our purposes .     as a function of the redshift for @xmath0cdm , @xmath7 cosmology and two different power law cosmologies .",
    "the parameters relevant for reionization have been fixed to the planck 2015 values for illustrative purposes@xcite ( helium mass fraction , cmb temperature at @xmath120 , @xmath34 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) . ]",
    "another definition for the redshift of the cmb is the one adopted by the planck collaboration@xcite by determining the redshift when the optical depth equals 1 .",
    "we denote @xmath125 the redshift obtained with the first definition ( eq.([visibility ] ) ) and @xmath94 the redshift obtained with the planck collaboration convention .",
    "although we use @xmath94 for consistency with planck when performing our analyses , we have defined @xmath125 for illustrative and comparative purposes .    in fig.[fig0 ]",
    "we show the visibility functions for @xmath0cdm , @xmath7 cosmology and two power law cosmologies ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) . in this case",
    "we have fixed the cosmological parameters to @xmath0cdm present - day values : @xmath128 and @xmath20@xcite .",
    "however , we have checked that any variation of 25% in one of these parameters has a negligible impact on the redshift of the cmb ( less than 0.6% ) for a fixed model and that it has no influence in our study .",
    "even if the redshift of the cmb does not change significantly with the parameters , it does change with the model ; therefore we fix @xmath129 for @xmath0cdm and @xmath130 for the @xmath7 cosmology . concerning the power law cosmology , since the redshift changes significantly with @xmath23 , we interpolate @xmath94 as a function of @xmath23 .",

    "the second definition ( the one adopted by the planck collaboration@xcite ) is given by the redshift at which the drag optical depth equals 1 .",

    "contrary to what we have seen in fig.[fig3 ] , adding the bao does modify the snia related parameters value , but we still obtain a very good fit to the snia data using the best - fit values obtained from snia+bao data and allowing for evolution . concerning the fit to bao data , using this combination of data to determine the best - fit values , we recover the results obtained with bao data alone ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this shows that when we relax the redshift independence for snia , the power in model selection from the combination of snia and bao weakens . as the power law cosmology",

    "we can deduce that adding a redshift evolution in the snia as a nuisance parameter leads to no clear preference of one model over another .",
    "we finally consider the addition of cmb data .",
    "notice that in this work we can not combine cmb and snia data , since we rely on the bao scale to introduce the cmb scale ( see sec.[cmb ] ) ; therefore we always need to consider bao data when including the cmb .",

    "we can now combine the information from the three probes : snia , bao and cmb .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig7 ] and in table[table3 ] . from the left plot",
    "we can see that adding the cmb information does not affect the fit to snia ( see left panel fig.[fig5 ] ) .",

    "it is important to notice here that the @xmath36 and the @xmath172 obtained for the @xmath7 and the power law cosmologies are acceptable , but the model criteria tell us that these models are highly improbable .",
    "this is due to the introduction of snia data .",
    "both models provide an acceptable fit to these data ; so , when including so much data points , the global fit is still acceptable .",
    "however , the model criteria are essentially sensitive to the exponential of the difference of @xmath36 , so they can distinguish between different models approximately fitting the data .",
    "it is a clear example between the difference of correctly fitting the data and being better than another model .        for completeness and in order to be as conservative as possible",
    ", we also consider a redshift evolution of snia .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig8 ] and in table[table3 ] . from the left plot",
    "we notice that adding the evolution leads to very good fits to snia data . however , from the right plot we can see that the redshift evolution in snia is not sufficient to compensate for the effect of the cmb , thus the power law and @xmath7 cosmologies are not able to correctly fit the bao data .",
    "the results from the model comparison still remain clear , showing that @xmath0cdm is very strongly preferred over the power law @xmath147exp@xmath173 and the @xmath7 @xmath174 and exp@xmath175 cosmologies .",
    "in this work we have studied the ability of three different models : @xmath0cdm , power law cosmology and @xmath7 cosmology to fit cosmological data and we have compared these models using two different model comparison statistics : the akaike information criterion and the bayesian information criterion .",
    "we have seen that all three models are able to fit the data if we only consider snia data , but @xmath7 is disfavored with respect to @xmath0cdm and the power law cosmology , from a model comparison point of view .",
    "considering bao data alone we have observed that @xmath0cdm is not a good fit to data , due to the anisotropic measurement of the lyman-@xmath73 forest , and we have seen that the power law cosmology is slightly preferred over @xmath0cdm ( and significantly preferred over the @xmath7 cosmology )",
    ". however , when combining snia and bao data , @xmath0cdm is preferred over the other models .",
    "we have then considered a possible redshift evolution in snia .",
    "this has led to an excellent fit to snia for all the models and , even when adding the bao data , there is no clearly preferred model .",
    "we have finally considered the scale information coming from the cmb . in order to use this information",
    "we have made one assumption : the physics driving the comoving sound horizon at the early universe in the @xmath7 and power law cosmologies is the same as in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this assumption is justified by the existence of radiation and baryon components in the power law and @xmath7 cosmologies , which should lead to an early universe photon - baryon plasma similar to the one predicted by @xmath0cdm . when adding the scale information from the cmb to bao and snia data we have observed that the goodness of fit remains the same for @xmath0cdm , but it is completely degraded for the other models . even adding some evolution to snia we have seen that it is not sufficient to compensate for the effect of the cmb .",
    "this degradation shows the tension present in the power law and @xmath7 cosmologies between the bao scale and the cmb scale , coming from the first peak of the temperature angular power spectrum .",
    "we can conclude that @xmath0cdm is statistically very strongly preferred over power law and @xmath7 cosmologies .",
