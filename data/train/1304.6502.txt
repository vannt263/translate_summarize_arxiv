    "the last couple of decades have observed a steadily growing interest in the field of systems at mesoscopic scales , thanks to the growing understanding of machines and engines with smaller dimensions .",
    "this has led to the area of stochastic thermodynamics which provides a framework for extending notions of classical thermodynamics to small systems wherein concepts of work , heat , and entropy are extended to the level of individual trajectories during nonequilibrium processes ( ensembles ) .",
    "research in this area has given birth to a group of exact and powerful theorems that dictate the behavior of such systems .",
    "they are commonly referred to as the _ fluctuation theorems _ ( fts ) @xcite , and these theorems are valid even far from equilibrium , a feat that is beyond the scope of the well - established linear response theory .",
    "the theorems provide stringent restrictions on the probabilities of phase space trajectories in which second law is transiently `` violated '' .",
    "they show that at the level where fluctuations are comparable to the relevant energy exchanges of the system , one needs to replace the associated quantities in the statement of the second law by their _ averages _ : @xmath0 or @xmath1 @xcite . here",
    "the angular brackets represent the ensemble average .",
    "thus , they in essence uphold the second law , even at the mesoscopic level , however , for the average properties .",
    "the crooks fluctuation theorem ( cft ) for heat states that the ratio of the probabilities of forward trajectory and the corresponding reverse trajectory for given initial states is given by @xcite @xmath2}{\\tilde{p}[\\tilde{x}|x_{\\tau}]}=e^{\\beta q}. \\label{mic_rev}\\ ] ] here , x is the short form of the phase space trajectory along the forward process @xmath3 generated by the protocol @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 represents the phase space point at time @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the corresponding reverse trajectory generated by the time reversed protocol @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the time of observation .",
    "@xmath10 is a given initial state of the forward process .",
    "the reverse process begins from the state @xmath11 , which is the time - reversal of the final state @xmath12 of the forward process .    using cft ,",
    "several other theorems like the jarzynski equality and entropy production ft , can be easily derived @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the validity of these fts in the presence of coarse - graining , when we transform the underdamped langevin equation to the overdamped one , in the limit of high friction .",
    "we find that a prominent difference in the analysis is observed between the overdamped ( coarse - grained ) and the underdamped systems , when the friction coefficient is space - dependent@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that space - dependent friction does not alter the equilibrium state .",
    "however , langevin dynamics of the system gets modified especially for the overdamped case .",
    "there are several physical systems wherein friction is space - dependent ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "in the presence of space - dependent friction @xmath13 , the equation of motion of the underdamped system of mass m moving in a time - dependent potential @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 note that the above equation contains multiplicative noise term . here , t is the temperature of the bath , while @xmath16 is the delta - correlated gaussian noise with zero mean : @xmath17 .",
    "the overhead dot denotes time - derivative , whereas prime represents space derivative .",
    "( [ l - ud ] ) has been derived microscopically by invoking system and bath coupling @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the high damping limit of eq .",
    "( [ l - ud ] ) is not equivalent to ignoring only inertial term @xcite .",
    "the detailed treatment leads to an extra term that is crucial for system to reach equilibrium state in absence of time - dependent perturbations ( see eq . [ eq : over ] below ) .    roughly speaking",
    ", this happens in the overdamped case because the random forces @xmath16 appear as delta - function pulses that cause jumps in @xmath18 .",
    "it then becomes unclear what value of @xmath18 must be provided in the argument of the function @xmath19 , because the value of the position at the time the delta - peak appears becomes undefined @xcite .",
    "it does not converge to a unique value even in the limit of small time step @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , we can plug in any value of position in - between @xmath21 ( position before the jump ) and @xmath22 ( position after the jump ) .",
    "these different values of position lead to different discretization schemes .",
    "the case is simpler in case of underdamped langevin equation .",
    "there , the jumps are caused in the velocities , while the position is a much smoother variable ( being an integral over the velocities ) .",
    "in other words , it does not feel the noise as delta peaks , but instead as a more well - behaved function . in that case , in the limit of small @xmath20 , the argument of @xmath19 is given by the unambiguous value @xmath21 .",
    "thus , in this case , an update in the values of @xmath18 and @xmath23 will be unique in each time step .",
    "let us now check the validity of cft in both the underdamped and overdamped cases .",
    "at first we want to calculate the ratio of path probabilities between forward and reverse process . in a given process ,",
    "let the evolution of the system in phase space be denoted by the phase space trajectory @xmath24 . here",
    ", @xmath25 represents the phase point at time @xmath26 . in general , the phase point includes both the position and the velocity coordinates of the system . in the overdamped case , however , it would consist of the position coordinate only .",
    "now , a given path @xmath27 , for a given initial point @xmath10 , would be fully determined if the sequence of noise terms for the entire time of observation is available ( this happens because there is no unambiguity in either the positions or the velocities , while updating their values by using the underdamped langevin equation , as discussed above ) : @xmath28 .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 therefore , the probability of obtaining the sequence @xmath31 will be @xcite @xmath32 \\propto \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_0^\\tau\\xi^2(t ) dt\\right ] .",

    "this completes our treatment for some fts in the underdamped case for a particle moving in space dependent friction .            above exact fts",
    "do not give any information about probability distribution of work @xmath66 , entropy @xmath67 etc .",
    "these distributions depend crucially on the specific problem being investigated .    here , we study these distributions for the case of driven particle in harmonic trap .",
    "apart from verifying fts we also see how the space dependent friction modifies the distribution of @xmath66 , and @xmath67 as compared to the particle moving in a space independent frictional coefficient @xmath68 ( which is the space average of @xmath13 ) .",
    "the underdamped langevin equation is given by @xmath69 @xmath70 is driven sinusoidal force of frequency @xmath71 and amplitude @xmath72 . for this model analytical solution can be obtained for space independent case only for both overdamped and underdamped case @xcite .    for simplicity in our study ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to two cases of space dependent friction ( i ) @xmath73 constant ( ii ) @xmath74    in fig.([u - w0 ] ) we have plotted the transient work distribution obtained after driving a system for one - fourth of a cycle for forward @xmath66 and corresponding reverse @xmath75 protocol .",
    "initially the system is equilibrated at appropriate initial values of protocol for forward and reverse process . in all our simulations , we have used the heun s method of numerical integration @xcite , and have generated @xmath76 realizations . implementing the heun s method tantamounts to using the stratonovich discretization scheme @xcite .",
    "henceforth we have used all the quantities in dimensionless form and taken k=1 , m=1 and @xmath77 . for case ( i ) , both distributions are gaussian nature , and they cross each other at @xmath78 , which is the free energy difference over one - fourth cycle .",
    "this is obtained numerically from @xmath79 , while theoretically we have @xmath80 .",

    "the distributions are non - gaussian but the crossing point is same as in space independent case .",
    "this is because the equilibrium distribution remain same in both cases .        in fig.([u - s ] ) we have plotted distribution of total entropy production of a driven brownian particle confined in a harmonic trap for one - fourth cycle . here",
    "the underlying dynamics is underdamped and we find that the distribution is gaussian for space independent case , while it is non - gaussian for space dependent case . if we take particle to be initially equilibrated at different temperature @xmath82 and then connected instantaneously to the given bath of temperature @xmath83 , and driven by same external force ( i.e , for athermal case ) , we find that the distribution of total entropy production is non - gaussian even for space independent case .",
    "this is consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "numerically we find @xmath84 which is well within our numerical accuracy .",
    "in all these distributions , we find that there is a finite weight for realizations having @xmath85 and @xmath86 , although the mean values follow the second law inequalities .",
    "these realizations are called transient second law violating trajectories .",
    "this finite weight is necessary to satisfy the fluctuation theorems @xcite .    after establishing the",
    "well known fts in the underdamped case , we turn our attention to the overdamped dynamics of the particle , in a space - dependent frictional medium .",
    "going to the overdamped regime implies coarse - graining . instead of evolution in full phase space ( coordinates and momenta ) , we restrict the evolution of the system to the position space only .",
    "this is equivalent to ignoring the information contained in the velocity variables .",
    "the treatment of overdamped case is more subtle and a proper methodology must be followed . in order to obtain a unique fokker - planck equation ( which is needed for a unique equilibrium distribution ) , the overdamped langevin equation must be modified , depending on the discretization process that is being used .",
    "it can be written as @xmath87 for detail we refer to @xcite .",

    "@xmath90 for ito convention , while @xmath91 and @xmath92 for stratonovich and and isothermal conventions , respectively . in earlier literature @xcite , the underdamped langevin equation in a stratonovich prescription is derived . in @xcite",

    "thus , under stratonovich scheme , the crooks fluctuation theorem for trajectories remains unaffected in the overdamped regime , even in the presence of multiplicative noise .",
    "since the stratonovich scheme is considered to be the physically correct one for a brownian particle in a heat bath @xcite , we may conclude that all the fluctuation theorems retain their forms as in the underdamped case .",
    "as in the underdamped case we study the nature of probability distribution for work and entropy for simple model of driven harmonic oscillator for both space independent and space dependent case and verifying fts numerically using heun s method ( which is equivalent to following stratonovich description as discussed earlier ) .",
    "the corresponding langevin equation is given by @xmath105 in fig.([o - w0 ] ) and fig.([o - wx ] ) , we have plotted the transient work distributions for forward and reverse processes , for space - independent and space - dependent friction , respectively .",
    "the functional form of @xmath13 are same as studied in underdamped case .",
    "all the units are in dimensionless form and we take @xmath106 , @xmath77 . we find that the distributions are gaussian for space independent case while for space dependent it is non - gaussian .",
    "but , the crossing point is same . from @xmath79 , the numerically obtained free energy difference @xmath80 , which is equal to the theoretical value , thus reassuring that space dependent friction",
    "does not alter the equilibrium distribution .        in fig.([ov - s ] ) we have plotted the distribution of total entropy production for the overdamped particle .",
    "we found that for space independent case the distribution is gaussian .",
    "this is true only if initial distribution is the thermal one .",
    "we have verified separately that for initial nonequilibrium distribution , @xmath67 is non gaussian .",
    "but for space dependent case @xmath67 is non - gaussian even initial equilibrium distribution .",
    "numerically we find @xmath84 which is well within our numerical accuracy .",
    "we can , following sekimoto @xcite , derive the expression for dissipated heat using the overdamped langevin dynamics ( substituting @xmath91 in eq . ):",
    "@xmath107 we found that microscopic reversibility gives ( see eq . ) @xmath108 the above two equations then give @xmath109 \\nn\\\\ & =   \\int_0^\\tau dt ~\\dot x \\left[\\gamma(x)\\dot x + \\frac{\\gamma'(x)t}{2\\gamma(x)}-\\sqrt{2\\gamma(x)t}~\\xi(t)\\right ] \\nn\\\\ & = \\int_0^\\tau dt ~\\dot x [ \\gamma(x)\\dot x -\\sqrt{2\\gamma(x)t}~\\xi(t ) ] + \\frac{t}{2}\\ln \\frac{\\gamma(x_\\tau)}{\\gamma(x_0 ) } \\nn\\\\ & = q_{conv } + \\frac{t}{2}\\ln \\frac{\\gamma(x_\\tau)}{\\gamma(x_0)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the conventional definition of heat .",
    "we thus get an extra boundary term in the definition , which assigns the logarithm of@xmath111 with the physical meaning of an entropy term .",
    "the presence of this term implies that if the particle begins from a given position @xmath10 with a small friction coefficient , then it dissipates more heat into the bath if it travels to a position @xmath112 with a greater friction coefficient .",
    "in this work , we have considered the validity of fts in presence of space - dependent friction , for both underdamped and overdamped limit .",
    "we find that , although no conceptual difficulties arise when the system is underdamped , the derivation of the fts are more involved for overdamped system . in latter case , where we have dealt with the stratonovich scheme of discretization ,",
    "the langevin equation contains extra terms and although crooks theorem remains valid , the definition of heat gets altered .",
    "thus , we conclude that the fts remain valid for the case of dynamics of a particle in space dependent frictional medium , even under coarse graining , i.e , reducing the description of the system of two phase space variable ( x , v , underdamped case ) , to a single phase space variable ( x , overdamped case ) .    as an illustration",
    ", we have analyzed the nature of @xmath67 and @xmath53 for the simple case of a driven harmonic oscillator in presence of space dependent friction , both in underdamped and the overdamped regime ( in stratonovich prescription ) .",
    "distributions for constant friction are compared with that of a particle moving in a space dependent frictional medium . moreover ,",
    "several fts have been verified .",
    "this model system is amenable to experimental verification @xcite .",
