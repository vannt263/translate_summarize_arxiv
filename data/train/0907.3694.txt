    "this conclusion is in contradiction with that of ref.@xcite where the radiation back reaction is finite and the 5-th order differential equation determines the evolution of photon - like charge .",
    "in general , the regularization procedure can be performed in two quite different ways : ( i ) one when green s functions are used in variational equations of motion ; ( ii ) the other when wave solutions are substituted for field variables in noether conservation laws ( e.g. , in energy - momentum carried by electromagnetic field ) . in @xcite the first way is realized which is a combination of some heuristic assumptions and calculations by methods of functional analysis .",

    "volume integration of the maxwell energy - momentum tensor density gives the flux of radiative momentum ( see section 4 ) . in section 5",
    "we present our main result  the effective equations of motion for a massless charged particle under the influence of an external force . since the radiation back reaction diverges when the particle is accelerated , the external device should not change its velocity .",
