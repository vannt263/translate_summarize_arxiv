    "there remain several uncertainties in our work .",
    "first , while our simulations include the key mhd physics present in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks ( i.e , strong ambipolar diffusion ) , we have only run a limited number of these simulations , for a relatively short interval . the roughly 100 orbit duration of our runs is limited by their computational demands , which remain prohibitive despite the considerable speed up from the use of super - time - stepping .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .  [ sttx_d_multi1 ] shows that towards the end of the calculation , the fractional variation in gas density approaches @xmath128 , and it is possible that integrating this run further would produce sustained zonal flows of roughly this amplitude .",
    "however , it is also possible that these particular zonal flows will decrease in strength and then fluctuate in a stochastic manner , as is observed in ideal and previous shearing box simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , there are some uncertainties in translating the local simulation results to predictions for trapping in global disk models .",
    "high resolution global disk simulations that include ambipolar diffusion , although currently challenging to run , will be essential for a definitive determination of whether outer disk zonal flows can trap particles . finally , while at face value our results show that particles will not be _ trapped _ , the pile - up effect due to changes in the radial drift velocity may still play a role in the planet formation process @xcite .",
    "we plan to address these various uncertainties in future work .",
    "even if zonal flows fail to strongly concentrate particles , their presence may still be observable . at 30  au , @xmath129 , and the zonal flow widths found in our simulations correspond to physical scales of the order of 5  au .",
    "although the perturbations to the gaseous surface density are modest , some degree of enhancement of the particle density due to differences in the radial drift speed across the flow is expected @xcite .",
    "early alma results show that there are some disks whose outer regions display dramatic _ non - axisymmetric _ dust distributions @xcite , and the relatively subtle axisymmetric structures resulting from our zonal flows would likely not be detectable in such systems .",
