    "these two quantum kz equations are equations for the product of @xmath0 wilson lines @xmath1 which are defined by the gauge model . these two quantum kz equations can be regarded as a quantum yang - mills equation since it is analogous to the classical yang - mills equation derived from the classical yang - mills gauge model .    from the two quantum kz equations we derive the skein relation of the homfly polynomial @xcite-@xcite .",

    "we show that this invariant gives a classification of closed 3-manifolds .",
    "then in section 20 we use this classification to prove the poincar conjecture .",
    "we shall first establish a quantum gauge model .",
    "this quantum gauge model will be as a physical motivation for introducing operators which will be called wilson loop and wilsom line as analogous to the wilson loops in the existing quantum field theories .",

    "the integral ( [ 1.1 ] ) has the following gauge symmetry : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a continuously differentiable real - valued function of @xmath38 .",

    "a feature of ( [ 1.1 ] ) is that it is not formulated with the four - dimensional space - time but is formulated with the one dimensional proper time .",
    "this one dimensional nature let this model avoid the usual utraviolet divergence difficulty of quantum fields .",
    "similar to the usual yang - mills gauge theory we can generalize this gauge model with @xmath39 gauge symmetry to nonabelian gauge models . as an illustration",
    "let us consider @xmath4 gauge symmetry .",
    "similar to ( [ 1.1 ] ) we consider the following energy integral : @xmath40ds \\label{n1}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a two dimensional complex vector ; @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes a component of a gauge field @xmath45 ; @xmath46 denotes a generator of @xmath4 ( here for simplicity we choose a convention that the complex @xmath47 is absorbed by @xmath46 ) ; and @xmath48 , @xmath43 where @xmath49 denotes the charge of interaction ( for simplicity let us set @xmath50 ) .    from ( [ n1 ] ) we can develop a nonabelian gauge model as similar to that for the above abelian gauge model .",
    "we have that ( [ n1 ] ) is invariant under the following gauge transformation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we shall mainly consider the case that @xmath54 is a function of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 are analytic functions of @xmath38 ( we let @xmath57 and we write @xmath58 ) .",
    "the above gauge model is based on the banach space @xmath59 of continuous functions @xmath60 on the one dimensional interval @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath10 is positive and the model is one dimensional ( and thus is simpler than the usual two dimensional yang - mills gauge model ) we have that this gauge model is similar to the wiener measure except that this gauge model has a gauge symmetry .",
    "this gauge symmetry gives a degenerate degree of freedom . in the physics literature the usual way to treat the degenerate degree of freedom of gauge symmetry is to introduce a gauge fixing condition to eliminate the degenerate degree of freedom where each gauge fixing will give equivalent physical results@xcite .",
    "there are various gauge fixing conditions such as the lorentz gauge condition , the feynman gauge condition , etc .",
    "we shall later in section [ sec6 ] ( on the kac - moody algebra ) adopt a gauge fixing condition for the above gauge model .",
    "this gauge fixing condition will also be used to derive the quantum kz equation in dual form which will be regarded as a quantum yang - mill equation since its role will be similar to the classical yang - mill equation derived from the classical yang - mill gauge model .",
    "since @xmath10 is positive we have that without gauge fixing condition the above gauge model is a positive linear functional on the banach space @xmath62 of continuous functions on @xmath59 and is multivalued in the sense that each gauge fixing gives a value .",
    "* remark*. in this paper the main aim of introducing this quantum gauge model is to derive the quantum kz equation in dual form which will be regarded as a quantum yang - mills equation ( or as a quantum euler - lagrange equation ) . from this quantum kz equation in dual form",
    "we then construct quantum knots and links . from quantum knots and links",
    "we then prove the poincare conjecture .",
    "similar to the wilson loop in quantum field theory @xcite from our quantum model we introduce an analogue of wilson loop , as follows .",
    "* definition*. a classical wilson loop @xmath63 is defined by : @xmath64 where @xmath7 denotes a representation of @xmath4 ; @xmath65 is a fixed curve where the quantum gauge models are based on it as specified in the above section . as usual the notation @xmath66 in the definition of @xmath63 denotes a path - ordered product @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "let us give some remarks on the above definition of wilson loop , as follows .",
    "\\1 ) we use the notation @xmath67 to mean the wilson loop @xmath63 which is based on the whole closed curve @xmath68 . here for convenience we use only the end points @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the curve @xmath68 to denote this wilson loop ( we keep in mind that the definition of @xmath67 depends on the whole curve @xmath68 connecting @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "then we extend the definition of @xmath63 to the case that @xmath68 is not a closed curve with @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath68 is not a closed curve we shall call @xmath67 as a wilson line .",
    "\\2 ) in constructing the wilson loop we need to choose a representation @xmath7 of the @xmath4 group .",
    "we shall see that because a wilson line @xmath67 is with two variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 a natural representation of a wilson line or a wilson loop is the tensor product of the usual two dimensional representation of @xmath4 for constructing the wilson loop .",
    "we first have the following theorem on @xmath73 :    for a given continuous path @xmath74 on @xmath75 $ ] the wilson line @xmath73 exists on this path and has the following transition property : @xmath76 where @xmath73 denotes the wilson line of a curve @xmath68 which is with @xmath69 as the starting point and @xmath70 as the ending point and @xmath38 is a point on @xmath68 between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "* proof*. we have that @xmath73 is a limit ( whenever exists ) of ordered product of @xmath77 and thus can be written in the following form : @xmath78 a_i(z(s_2))\\frac{dx^i(s_2)}{ds}ds_2 + \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \\end{array } \\label{df3}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 . then since @xmath81 are continuous on @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 are continuously differentiable on @xmath84 $ ] we have that the series in ( [ df3 ] ) is absolutely convergent .",
    "thus the wilson line @xmath73 exists .",
    "then since @xmath73 is the limit of ordered product we can write @xmath73 in the form @xmath85 by dividing @xmath68 into two parts at @xmath38 .",
    "this proves the theorem . @xmath72    * remark ( classical and quantum wilson loop)*. this theorm means that the wilson line @xmath73 exists in the classical pathwise sense where @xmath81 are as classical paths on @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "this pathwise version of the wilson line @xmath73 ; from the feymann path integral point of view ; is as a partial description of the quantum version of the wilson line @xmath73 which is as an operator when @xmath81 are as operators .",
    "we shall in the next section derive and define a quantum generator @xmath11 of @xmath73 from the quantum gauge model . then by using this generator @xmath11 we shall compute the quantum version of the wilson line @xmath73 .",
    "we shall denote both the classical version and quantum version of wilson line by the same notation @xmath73 when there is no confusion .",
    "@xmath72    * remark*. we remark again that in order to simplify the mathematics of this paper we treat the above quantum gauge model as a physical motivation instead of as the mathematical foundation of this paper .",
    "the mathematical foundation of this paper will base on the definition of the wilson line @xmath73 and the generator @xmath11 instead of the above quantum gauge model which is as a physical motivation for introducing the wilson line @xmath73 and the generator @xmath11 .",

    "the simplest knot diagram of this knot has four crossings .",
