    "similar combinatorial curvature notions have been introduced by many other authors , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "our main geometric results are given in subsection [ cheegexp ] , where we    * provide lower bounds for both cheeger constants in terms of combinatorial curvatures ( see theorem [ t : cheeg ] below ) , * provide upper bounds for the exponential growth in terms of an upper vertex bound ( see theorem [ t : expgr ] below ) .    even though theorem [ t : expgr](b ) is formulated in terms of bounds on vertex and face degrees , it can also be considered as an estimate in terms of combinatorial curvature , as is explained in the remark following the theorem .",
    "in fact , the proof is based on the corresponding curvature version .",
    "now we discuss connections to the spectrum .",
    "the cheeger constant and the exponential growth were first introduced in the context of riemannian manifolds and were useful invariants to estimate the bottom of the ( essential ) spectrum of the laplacian ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "this radialisation would be again a non - vanishing @xmath36-eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue and , since its values would only depend on the distance to @xmath6 , there would be an easy recursion formula for its values .",

    ".    with this final observation we can now prove theorem [ t : cheeg ] .",
    "let @xmath17 be a polygon .",
    "since @xmath239 , we conclude from proposition [ p : dd_e w ] that @xmath240 taking the infimum over all polygons yields part ( a ) of the theorem .    for the proof of part ( b ) , recall that @xmath241 for all vertices @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that @xmath242 and , consequently , for polygons @xmath17 , @xmath243 the statement follows now again by taking the infimum over all polygons .",
    "parts ( a ) and ( b ) of theorem [ t : expgr ] have very different proofs .",
    "we present them separately .",
    "we choose a vertex @xmath244 and introduce the following functions @xmath245 : @xmath246 note that the face @xmath7 `` opens up '' at distance @xmath247 and `` closes up '' at distance @xmath248 from @xmath249 .",
    "we call a face @xmath7 _ finite _ , if @xmath250 .",
    "the idea of the proof is to `` open up '' successively every finite face @xmath161 into an infinigon without violating the vertex bound . in this way",
    ", we will build up a comparison tree @xmath251 with the same vertex bound @xmath57 and satisfying @xmath252 .",
    "it turns out , however , that finite faces @xmath7 with more than one vertex in the sphere @xmath253 cause problems in this `` opening up '' procedure ( since the distance relations to the vertex @xmath249 will be changed ) .",
    "therefore , we first modify the tessellation @xmath0 by removing all edges connecting two vertices @xmath69 at the same distance to @xmath249 . the modified planar graph is denoted by @xmath254 . to keep track ,",
    "we add at each of the vertices @xmath69 a short terminal edge .",
    "these terminal edges do not belong `` officially '' to the graph @xmath255 and serve merely as reminders that an edge can be added in their place without violating the vertex bound of the graph .",
    "moreover , we can only guarantee @xmath256 , if these inofficial edges are included in @xmath255 .",
    "( at the end of the procedure we will replace all `` inofficial '' terminal edges by infinite trees rooted in @xmath6 and @xmath85 . ) the modification @xmath257 is illustrated in figure [ openup1 ] .",
    "( for convenience , the vertices belonging to distance spheres @xmath258 are arranged to lie on concentric euclidean circles around @xmath249 . )",
    "note that none of the distance relations of the vertices in @xmath255 ( without the inofficial terminal edges ) to the vertex @xmath249 are changed and that we still have @xmath259 .",
    "moreover , the modified graph @xmath260 ( without the inofficial terminal edges ) has a new set of faces @xmath261 .",
    "every finite face @xmath7 of @xmath255 has now even degree , since @xmath7 opens up at a single vertex in the sphere @xmath262 and @xmath7 closes up at a single vertex in the sphere @xmath253 .",
    "next we explain the first step of our procedure , namely , how to open up @xmath265 into an infinigon @xmath266 .",
    "let @xmath267 and @xmath268 such that @xmath269 .",
    "since @xmath270 , we can find an infinite geodesic ray @xmath271 such that @xmath272 .",
    "we may think of @xmath249 as being the origin of the plane and of @xmath273 as being arranged to lie on the positive vertical coordinate axis at heights @xmath274 with straight edges between them .",
    "now we cut our plane along this geodesic ray , i.e. , replace the ray by two parallel copies of the ray and thus preventing the face @xmath265 from closing up at distance @xmath24 . in this way , @xmath265 becomes an infinigon , which we denote by @xmath266 .",
    "( in fact , we rotationally shrink the angle @xmath275 to @xmath276 around @xmath249 to open up a conic sector of angle @xmath277 containing the infinigon @xmath266 . )",
    "the procedure is illustrated in figure [ openup2 ] .",
    "note that the vertices @xmath278 are replaced by two copies @xmath279 , such that @xmath280 is connected to @xmath281 for @xmath282 and @xmath283 inherits all previous neighbors of @xmath278 at one side of the ray and @xmath284 inherits all previous neighbors of @xmath278 at the other side of the ray ( this concerns in particular also the `` inofficial '' vertices ) . in this way we obtain a new planar graph @xmath285 .        in the second step",
    "we carry out the same procedure with the face @xmath290 , and obtain a new connected planar graph @xmath291 , with @xmath290 replaced by the infinigon @xmath292 . again , after including the inofficial terminal edges , the graph @xmath293 has vertex bound @xmath57 and satisfies @xmath294 .",
    "it is now clear how to repeat the procedure .",
    "note that for every radius @xmath295 there is a large enough @xmath296 such that the graphs @xmath297 remain unaltered inside the balls @xmath298 .",
    "this fact guarantees that there is a well - defined limiting graph associated to the sequence @xmath299 .",
    "this limit is a connected tree @xmath300 ( since all faces of @xmath300 are infinigons ) . in @xmath300 , we replace now finally the inofficial terminal edges by infinite trees , rooted at the corresponding proper vertices of the tree @xmath300 , with branching sequence @xmath301 .",
    "these infinite trees can be nicely fitted into the infinigons to yield an infinite planar tree @xmath251 with vertex bound @xmath57 and satisfying @xmath302 .",
    "since we obviously have @xmath303 , the proof of part ( a ) of the theorem is finished .",
    "we prove the equivalent curvature version of the statement , given in the remark after the theorem .",
    "since @xmath304 for all faces @xmath7 , @xmath0 is a tessellating plane graph in the sense of @xcite and we have @xmath305 since @xmath306 is a discrete set and bounded from below by @xmath307 , we can assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath307 is of the form @xmath308 , for some integer value @xmath309 .",
    "( in fact , @xmath57 is the optimal upper bound on the vertex degree of @xmath0 . )",
    "let @xmath310 be the combinatorial spheres and balls in @xmath0 with respect to a reference vertex @xmath244 and @xmath311 .",
    "corollary 6.4 of @xcite states that we have @xmath312 applying this equation twice , we derive @xmath313 hence we obtain the following recursion inequality @xmath314 with @xmath146 .",
    "it is easy to see that the sequence @xmath315 is strictly increasing and dominates the sequence @xmath316 .",
    "moreover , @xmath317 describes the cardinality of a sphere of radius @xmath24 in the regular tessellation @xmath126 .",
    "this implies that @xmath318 .",
    "now , we return to the sequence @xmath317 , as defined in .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath319 .",
    "the recursion formula implies that @xmath320 with constants @xmath321 chosen in such a way that the initial conditions are satisfied . since @xmath322",
    "we conclude that @xmath323 , for otherwise we would have @xmath324 , contradicting to the fact that @xmath126 is an infinite graph .",
    "hence , @xmath317 behaves asymptotically like @xmath325 with a positive constant @xmath6 .",
    "this , together with implies that @xmath326 in the case @xmath327 , the sequence is simply given by @xmath328 .",
