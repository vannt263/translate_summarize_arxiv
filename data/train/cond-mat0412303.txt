    "the study of the nature of directed motion induced by random noise in periodic systems in the absence of a bias has attracted wide interest . by now , the rectification of thermal fluctuations have become a major area of research in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the presence of unbiased nonequilibrium perturbations , either stochastic or deterministic , together with a broken spatial or temporal asymmetry play a key role in obtaining directed motion without violating the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "such systems or ratchets convert nonequilibrium fluctuations into useful work in the presence of load . moreover ,",
    "in these systems , noise play a constructive role ( i.e. , transformation of noise in spatially periodic systems into directed current ) .",
    "a large family of models of brownian ratchets  @xcite have been introduced to obtain insight into the basic mechanism of noise rectification .",
    "some of them are flashing ratchets , rocking ratchets , time asymmetric ratchets , frictional ratchets etc  @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have been carried out to understand the nature of currents , their possible reversals and also the efficiency of energy transduction .",
    "the results obtained are utilized to develop proper models that efficiently separate particles of micro and nano sizes and also for the development of machines at nano scales  @xcite .",
    "such models are also the prototype to understand the basic mechanism of operation of molecular motors or protein molecules in our cells that transfer cargo and organelles very efficiently in a very noisy environment .",
    "it also has extensions in game theory under the name of parrondo s paradox  @xcite .",
    "these are basically counter intuitive games based on translation of the dynamics of brownian particle in a flashing ratchet to gambling games . here , two losing games ( or strategies ) , when alternated randomly or periodically give rise to a winning game .",
    "these paradoxes have a profound role in several multidisciplinary areas . with the emergence of a separate subfield called stochastic energetics  @xcite it is possible to establish the compatibility between langevin or fokker - planck formalism , which describes stochastic dynamics , and the laws of thermodymanics .",
    "using this framework one can calculate various physical quantities such as thermodynamic efficiency of energy transduction  @xcite , energy dissipation ( hysteresis loss ) , entropy ( entropy production )  @xcite etc .",
    ", thereby providing a new tool to study systems far from equilibrium .",
    "the intrinsic irreversibility associated with ratchet operation makes the ratchet to be less efficient .",
    "for example , the attained value of efficiency in flashing and rocking ratchet were found to be below the subpercentage regime .",
    "however , it has been shown that at very low temperatures fine tuning of parameters could lead to a larger efficiency , the regime of parameters being very narrow  @xcite .",
    "optimization of energetic efficiency of the sawtooth ratchet in presence of spatial symmetry but in presence of time symmetric rocking has been worked out in detail in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , protocols to optimize the efficiency is given in  @xcite .",
    "recently makhnovskii et al .",
    "@xcite constructed a special type of flashing ratchet with two asymmetric double - well periodic - potential- states displaced by half a period .",
    "such flashing ratchet models were found to be highly efficient with efficiency an order of magnitude higher than in earlier models  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind this enhanced efficiency is that even for diffusive brownian motion the choice of appropriate potential profile ensures suppression of backward motion and hence reduction in the accompanying dissipation .",
    "similar to the case of flashing ratchets  @xcite , we had earlier @xcite studied the motion of a particle in a rocking ratchet by applying a temporally asymmetric but unbiased periodic forcings  @xcite in the presence of a sinusoidal potential .",
    "the efficiency obtained was very high , much above the subpercentage level ( about @xmath0 without fine tuning ) in the presence of temporal asymmetry alone .    in the present work we study the same problem but in a saw tooth potential and make a comparison so as to elucidate the sensitivity of these physical quantities on the smoothness or regularity of the underlying ratchet potential .",
    "the important underlying factor is the temporal asymmetry  @xcite in the external forcing which leads to noise induced currents in the absence of external bias even for the case of spatially symmetric potential . in this adiabatically rocked time",

    "the surprisingly sensitive dependence of the physical quantities such as unidirectional current on the degree of regularity or smoothness of the ratchets ( continuous and discontinuous forces ) has been demonstrated by doering et al  @xcite .",
    "ai et al .",
    "@xcite have also studied the same problem of a brownian particle moving in a periodic saw tooth potential subjected to a temporally asymmetric periodic rocking .",
    "however , there is an error in the expression for the energy per unit time that a ratchet gets from the external force or in other words , the input energy  @xcite . in this work",
    "we take into account this correction and have calculated the efficiency and other physical quantities and presented our results .",
    "we find that the temporal asymmetry in driving enhances the efficiency in a very significant manner even for a spatially symmetric potential .",
    "also , in the presence of spatial asymmetry in potential , the efficiency is found to be almost @xmath1 at low temperature .",
    "current reversals are also observed in the parameter space of operation even in the adiabatic regime .",
    "we also present our analysis of the behaviour of entropy production , current and input energy with temperature in this ratchet system . in the absence of any bias",
    "the noise induced currents show a peak with temperature .",
    "the question that naturally arises is whether this peak is related to underlying resonance ( stochastic resonance  @xcite ) due to the synchronization of the position of the particle with the external drive induced by the noise .",
    "our analysis of input energy @xmath2 , rules out the presence of any resonance features in the dynamics of the position of the particle in these systems in the adiabatic regime  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the earlier works which show that the existence of stochastic resonance in the dynamics of the particle is revealed by a peak in the input energy  @xcite .",
    "the onset of unidirectional currents in ratchet systems can also be viewed as an example of temporal order coming out of disorder .",
    "this can happen only at the expense of an overall increase in the entropy production in the system along with its environment .",

    "[ currev ] we have plotted current versus temperature with fixed value of @xmath108 and varying @xmath22 . as we vary @xmath22 from large value to a small value , in the intermediate range of @xmath22 we get current reversal .",
    "having discussed efficiency and nature of currents and their reversals we now study other thermodynamic quantities namely , input energy and entropy production .",
    "we would like to find whether any relation exists among them with the nature of currents as discussed in the introduction .",
    "some recent studies have also tried to reveal the relations between two completely unrelated phenomena , namely , stochastic resonance and brownian ratchets in a formal way through the consideration of fokker - planck equations  @xcite .",
    "stochastic resonance is a phenomenon where we can obtain optimal output from a system by adding noise to the system  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the rate of flow of particles in a brownian ratchet is analogous to the rate of flow of information in the case of stochastic resonance  @xcite .    , @xmath111 and @xmath2 vs temperature for @xmath112 with fixed @xmath75 , @xmath53 and @xmath106 .",
    "the current @xmath57 is blown up by a factor of ten to make it more clearer.,width=268,height=182 ]    in fig .",
    "[ ent - cur - indel4e8 ] we plot the entropy production , current and input energy for a representative case , @xmath112 , @xmath51 and @xmath106 , as a function of temperature or noise strength .",
    "we observe that current exhibits a peak as a function of temperature while the input energy is a monotonously increasing function of temperature  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued earlier that the peak in the input energy is a good measure for the occurrence of stochastic resonance in the dynamics of the particle  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect at resonance that the system will extract more input energy from the environment which in turn is consequently dissipated away in the steady state ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the observed monotonic behaviour of the input energy , as opposed to the nature of current , rules out the possibility of any resonance in the dynamics of the particle as a function of noise strength .",
    "the presence of net currents in the ratchet increases the amount of known information about the system than otherwise .",
    "this extra bit of information comes from the negentropy or the physical information supplied by the external nonequilibrium bath .",
    "since the currents are generated at the expense of entropy one normally expects the maxima in current and the maxima in the overall entropy production to coincide at the same value of noise strength .",
    "in fact , in a related development it has been pointed out that the amount of information transferred by the nonequilibrium bath is quantified in terms of algorithmic complexity . moreover , the algorithmic complexity or kolmogorov information entropy exhibits a maxima at the same value of physical parameter where the current is maximum  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ ent - cur - indel4e8 ] , we see that the entropy production , @xmath111 , also exhibits a peak as a function of noise strength .",
    "the peaks in the average current , @xmath57 and total entropy production @xmath111 do not occur at the same @xmath109 .",
    "this clearly indicates that maxima in the entropy production does not take place at the same value where the current is maximum thereby ruling out the correlation between the entropy production peak and the peak in current maximum  @xcite .",
    "we have studied in detail the nature of energetic efficiency driven by zero average time asymmetric forcing in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the potential is taken to be of the saw tooth type characterized by an asymmetry parameter @xmath68 . in the presence of temporal and spatial asymmetry",
    "we have shown that a much higher efficiency , above the subpercentage regime ( known for other ratchets ) , can be readily obtained . spatial asymmetry together with temporal asymmetry give larger efficiency as compared to the presence of spatial or temporal asymmetry alone . at low temperatures an efficiency value closer to the ideal limit can be obtained by judicious tuning of physical parameters even though the operation of the ratchet is in the irreversible mode . in the bigger range of parameter space temperature",
    "does not facilitate energy transduction . by fine tuning the parameters one can obtain a regime in which temperature facilitates energy transduction .",
    "however , in this parameter space the attained value of efficiency is found to be in the subpercentage level .",
    "we also observe current reversals in the adiabatic limit by proper tuning of different parameters .",
    "these reversals are attributed to the complex dynamics of the system . from our study of the nature of input energy and currents",
    "we conclude that there is no resonance phenomenon occurring in the system .",
    "the analysis of current and entropy production results show that the peak in current and entropy production do not coincide .",
    "it is worthwhile exploring whether the transport in these efficient ratchet is coherent or not .",
    "noise induced currents are always accompanied by a diffusive spread .",
    "if the diffusive spread of the particle is less than the average distance ( say , length of the period of the potential ) travelled by the particle in a given time then the transport is said to be coherent .",
    "this is quantified in terms of the so - called dimensionless peclet number  @xcite .",
    "the present work is concentrated mainly on optimizing the thermodynamic efficiency .",
    "one can as well optimize maximum work or have the best compromise between maximum work and efficiency .",
    "this can be done using known optimizing criterion  @xcite .",
