    "<S> we show the existence of a lower bound on the volume symmetry energy parameter @xmath0 from unitary gas considerations . </S>",

    "<S> the bounds are found to be consistent with both recent calculations of the energies of pure neutron matter and constraints from nuclear experiments . </S>",
    "<S> these results are significant because many equations of state in active use for simulations of nuclear structure , heavy ion collisions , supernovae , neutron star mergers , and neutron star structure violate these constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear symmetry energy is one of the decisive ingredients in compact star astrophysics as well as in nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> it provides the pressure of neutron star matter , which is nearly pure neutron matter ( pnm ) near the saturation density @xmath2 @xmath3 , which largely determines neutron star radii  @xcite and therefore properties of their crusts , moments of inertia , tidal polarizabilities and binding energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry energy is also important in calculations of the r - process  @xcite , supernovae  @xcite , and neutron star mergers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> terrestrial experiments measuring nuclear masses , dipole resonances and neutron skin thicknesses can constrain the symmetry energy  @xcite , as can experiments using normal and radioactive nuclear beams  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible source of additional information is the unitary gas . </S>",
    "<S> universal behavior emerges for fermions interacting via pairwise @xmath4-wave interactions with an infinite scattering length ( @xmath5 ) and a vanishing effective range ( @xmath6 ) , _ i.e. _ the unitary gas ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an historical review ) . since in this case </S>",
    "<S> the average particle distance is the only length scale of the system , the ground state energy per particle in the unitary gas @xmath7 is proportional to the fermi energy @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is referred to as the bertsch parameter and has the experimentally measured value @xmath11  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pnm at low densities is considered to be close to the unitary limit since the @xmath4-wave scattering length of the @xmath12 system is @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to @xmath14 at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the neutron fermi momentum , whereas the unitary gas limit is @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that nuclear symmetry energy parameters are significantly constrained by the unitary gas energy , based on the conjecture that @xmath7 provides the lower bound of the energy per nucleon in pnm ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19     compared to ab initio calculations of refs .  </S>",

    "<S> thus , the unitary gas energy should serve as a lower bound for @xmath18 at low densities . at higher densities , however , @xmath23 and higher partial wave interactions may spoil this bound . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the average @xmath23-wave interaction is very small but attractive .    when comparing the unitary gas with calculations using only nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions , one finds that neutron matter behaves approximately as a unitary gas . </S>",
    "<S> softer nn interactions lead to slightly more attraction compared to the unitary gas and harder interactions give slightly more repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> this may be due to less short - range correlations for softer interactions . in the nn - only results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the maximum difference of the energy from that of the unitary gas is approximately @xmath24 at @xmath15 .    in neutron matter , however , recent ab initio calculations showed the importance of the inclusion of three - body ( 3n ) forces , which are repulsive in low- to moderate - density neutron matter and increase the neutron - matter energy by several @xmath25 at @xmath15 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : efgbound ] we show a comparison of the unitary gas bound with several ab initio calculations for pnm including both nn and 3n forces of refs .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only two calculations intersect with the unitary gas constraint within their uncertainty bands and for the softest interactions : a chiral n@xmath26lo calculation  @xcite and quantum monte carlo n@xmath27lo calculations using chiral forces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the first this is due to the behavior of one particular hamiltonian at intermediate densities , while for the latter this is due to the use of local regulators , which lead to less repulsion from 3n forces  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , empirically one finds @xmath28 in ab initio calculations . </S>",
    "<S> although it can not be proven that the unitary gas is a lower bound for the neutron matter energy at all densities , the combination of effective - range effects , small tensor interactions , and repulsive 3n forces in neutron matter strongly suggests that this conjecture is justified .    _ constraint on symmetry energy : _ at baryon density @xmath29 </S>",
