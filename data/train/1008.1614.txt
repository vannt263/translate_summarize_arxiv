    "over more than half a century , observers of the astonishing ubiquity of the empirical laws of zipf and benford have been puzzled by their seeming universal validity and intrigued about the plausible answer to the central question of why they appear in so many contexts .",
    "as it is widely known , zipf s law refers to the ( approximate ) power law that is displayed by sets of data ( populations of cities , words in texts , impact factors of scientific journals , etc . ) when these are given a ranking ( in relation to size of populations , frequency of words , magnitude of impact factors , etc . )",
    "benford s law is a well - known simple logarithmic rule for the frequency of first digits found in listings of data ( stock market prices , census data , heat capacities of chemicals , etc . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been argued that benford s law is a special case of zipf s law precursor1 .",
    "indeed the relationship between the two has been made explicit some years ago @xcite by first obtaining a generalization of benford s law from the basic assumption that the underlying probability distribution @xmath0 of the data @xmath1 under consideration is scale invariant and therefore has the form of the power law @xmath2 , @xmath3 . a simple integration over @xmath0 , to obtain the relative probability for consecutive integers @xmath4 and @xmath5 , leads , when @xmath6 , to @xmath7 which is benford s law .",
    "the next step in ref .",
    "@xcite was to obtain the rank @xmath8 from @xmath0 , this time as an integration over @xmath0 from @xmath9 , the number of data that define the rank @xmath8 , to a finite number @xmath10 that corresponds to the first value of the rank @xmath8 . in the limit @xmath11",
    "they obtain @xmath12 that is zipf s law with exponent @xmath13 when @xmath14 .  for many sets of real data @xmath15 and",
    "the standard zipf law is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "here we expand on the results of ref .",
    "our first , simple , step is to keep @xmath10 finite , but as we argue below , this consideration facilitates the articulation of a major inference on the physical nature of the laws of zipf and benford .",
    "we contend that these laws are related to a general thermodynamic expression , albeit for a special type of thermodynamic structure obtained from the usual via a scalar deformation parameter represented by the power @xmath17 .",
    "the general thermodynamic expression is seen to represent an ( incomplete ) legendre transform ( akin to a landau free energy or a free energy density functional ) between two thermodynamic potentials , the expression relating the corresponding partition functions becomes a generalized zipf s law .",
    "we identify these quantities as well as the conjugate variables involved , which are the rank @xmath18 and the inverse of the total number of data @xmath19 .",
    "we also reason that this kind of deformed thermodynamics arises from the existence of a strong impediment in accessing configurational phase space , that materializes in only a fractal or multifractal subset of this space being available to the system .",
    "a quantitative consequence of considering @xmath20 finite is the reproduction of the small - rank bend displayed by real data before the power - law behavior sets in .",
    "the power law regime in the theoretical expression persists up to infinite rank @xmath21 , indicating a kind of ` thermodynamic limit ' .",
    "we illustrate this feature by comparison with on hand data for frequencies of english words in texts words1 .",
    "we refer to the application of this scheme to the degree distribution of scale - free networks .",
    "a subsequent development is the identification of a strict analogy between the aforementioned thermodynamic expression and that for ( all ) the trajectories at the transition to chaos via intermittency in nonlinear low - dimensional maps , the so - called tangent bifurcation @xcite .",
    "these critical trajectories follow @xcite the exact closed form of the functional - composition renormalization group ( rg ) fixed - point map hu1 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we associate the same statistical - mechanical structure to the nonlinear dynamics at this transition .",
    "further , we examine the modifications brought upon the generalized law of zipf by the corresponding shift of the map out of tangency into the chaotic regime . these consist in the introduction of an upper bound for the rank @xmath8 and the reproduction of the tail observed for large rank in real data .",
    "we illustrate our scheme by comparison with available numerical data for the so - called eigenfactor of physics journals @xcite , industrial production rates @xcite , and carbon emissions @xcite .",
    "the analogy indicates that the most common value for the index @xmath17 should be @xmath16 .",
    "lastly , we make use of the statistical - mechanical interpretation to extend our analysis .",
    "we presuppose that the legendre transformation expressed by these laws can be finalized in the usual way and eliminate the variable @xmath19 in favor of @xmath8 . to accomplish this step",
    "it is necessary to specify the ( partition ) function @xmath22 , a feature of the available data or a prerogative of the data collector , and evaluate the ` equation of state ' @xmath23 . in doing this it becomes clear that the universality of the laws is due to the general form of the incomplete legendre transformation , while the initial and transformed thermodynamic potentials are particular of the data in hand .    thus , in the next section 2 we reproduce the expressions in ref .",
    "pietronero1 relevant to our purposes . in section 3",
    "we describe the generalized statistical - mechanical structure we observe in these expressions . in the following section 4 we present the parallelism between the ranking of data and the critical dynamics at the tangent bifurcation in nonlinear maps and",
    "describe the finite size effect of the former . in section 5",
    "we extend the statistical - mechanical description and draw conclusions on the apparent universality of the aforementioned empirical laws .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with a summary and discussion . a partial preliminary account of the contents of this paper appeared in ref .",
    "denote by @xmath0 the probability distribution associated to the set of data under consideration ( e.g. , the distribution obtained from a histogram generated by data - a total of @xmath24 numbers - giving the magnitudes of the population of a set of countries ) . under the assumption of scale",

    "( [ benford2 ] ) we look at the quantities contained in it . we notice that both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given by the integrals@xmath55and these in turn can be seen , when @xmath6 , to conform to the evaluation of entropy @xmath56 or @xmath57 where the probability of @xmath1 equally - probable configurations in phase space is @xmath46 @xmath58 .",
    "if we now allow for @xmath14 we can retain the same interpretation,@xmath59with @xmath46 @xmath47 still viewed as the probability of @xmath1 equally - probable phase - space configurations , and with @xmath10 and @xmath9 playing the roles of total configurational numbers or partition functions .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ benford2 ] ) can be rewritten as@xmath60and read as the expression of what we refer to as an _",

    "the conjugate variables @xmath19 and @xmath8 could be seen to play the roles , for example , of inverse temperature @xmath63 and energy @xmath64 in the description of a thermal system . as we know",
    "the legendre transform is performed in two steps , the first is to add ( subtract ) the product of two conjugate variables from one thermodynamic potential and the second is to eliminate the variable in the first potential in favor of the other variable to obtain the second potential .",
    "the last step involves the derivative of the first potential , as the legendre transform is associated to an extremum value . but stopping the procedure at the first step and use of the generalized potential that depends on the two conjugate variables is not devoid of use .",
    "familiar examples of incomplete legendre transforms are the landau free energy ( when describing a magnet it has a dependence on both magnetization and external field ) and the free energy density functionals associated to many thermal problems .",
    "( [ zipf2 ] ) , being the inverse of eq .",
    "( [ benford2 ] ) , states the same relationship but in terms of the ` partition functions ' @xmath9 and @xmath22 .",

    "remarkably , there is a strict analogy between the generalized law of zipf , eqs .",
    "( [ benford2 ] ) and ( [ zipf2 ] ) , and the nonlinear dynamics for the rg fixed - point map at the tangent bifurcation , as originally realized in ref . @xcite .",
    "consequently , these two apparently different problems share the same statistical - mechanical interpretation indicated in the previous section , and the equivalence offers an alternative to advance our analysis , specifically , the characterization of finite size effects for the generalized law in terms of the shift of the map out of tangency .    the analogy can be seen immediately after a brief recall of the rg treatment of the tangent bifurcation that mediates the transition between chaotic and periodic attractors @xcite . the common procedure to study the transition to chaos from a trajectory of period @xmath4 starts with the composition @xmath67 of a one - dimensional map @xmath68 at such bifurcation , followed by an expansion for the neighborhood of one of the @xmath4 points tangent to the line with unit slope @xcite .",

    "we show that there is a common source behind eqs .",
    "( [ benford2 ] ) and ( trajectory2 ) , i.e. the restriction of accessibility to phase space already mentioned .",

    "it is relevant to determine the duration of the so - called laminar episodes @xcite , i.e. , the average time spent by the trajectories going through the bottle neck \" formed in the region where the map is closest to the line of unit slope .",
    "naturally , the duration of the laminar episodes diverges at the tangent bifurcation when the lyapunov exponent for separation of trajectories vanishes .",

    "the steepest - descent approximation is central to statistical mechanics ( and in a more general context to large deviation theory @xcite ) .",
    "this property facilitates the evaluation in the thermodynamic limit of a partition function for one particular ensemble in terms of the partition function of another .",
    "thermodynamically , this approximation relates to the legendre transformation between the corresponding free energies or massieu potentials where one variable is eliminated in favor of its conjugate callen1 . as recalled above ,",
    "the procedure consists of two steps , summation ( or subtraction ) of the product of the conjugate variables to ( or from ) the first potential to define the second , followed by use of the derivative of the first potential , or equation of state , to remove the undesired variable .",

    "this exercise suggests that the universality of the laws is due to the general form of the incomplete legendre transformation , while the expressions for the initial and transformed potentials are specific to the design of the data sample under consideration .",
