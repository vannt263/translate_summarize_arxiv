    "the measurement of the first moment of the proton s spin - dependent structure function @xmath8 by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) @xcite revealed a discrepancy from the ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite and also the fact that the su(3 ) flavor - singlet axial charge @xmath9 was smaller than expected from the static and relativistic quark models @xcite .",
    "after these discoveries , experimental efforts @xcite focused on a detailed understanding of the spin structure of the proton .",
    "the proton spin @xmath10 can be decomposed as @xmath11 from conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the measurements precisely determined the total spin carried by quarks and anti - quarks , @xmath12 , which is only about @xmath13% of the proton spin .",
    "the remaining proton spin can be attributed to the other components , the gluon spin contribution ( @xmath14 ) and/or orbital angular momentum contributions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the total gluon polarization is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent bjorken @xmath17 and factorization scale respectively .",
    "the challenge for the @xmath19 determination is to precisely map the gluon polarization density @xmath20 over a wide range of @xmath17 .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , which can accelerate polarized proton beams up to 255  gev , is a unique and powerful facility to study the gluon polarization .",
    "one of the main goals of the rhic physics program is to determine the gluon polarization through measurements of longitudinal double - spin asymmetries ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the cross sections of a specific process in the polarized @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1 collisions with same and opposite helicities .",

    "@xmath0 has been measured previously in several channels by phenix and star , including inclusive @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite , and jet @xcite production .    using the measured asymmetries , as well as the world - data on polarized inclusive and semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xcite , a global analysis based on perturbative - quantum - chromodynamics ( pqcd ) calculation",
    "was performed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong - coupling constant @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath29 from the best fit is too small to explain the proton spin in the bjorken @xmath17 range of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) without considering @xmath15 , though a substantial gluon polarization is not ruled out yet due to the uncertainties .",

    "therefore , this channel has good sensitivity to the polarized gluon density .",
    "in addition , the large mass of the heavy quark ensures that pqcd techniques are applicable for calculations of the cross section .",

    "these electrons are called `` photonic electrons '' , while all the other electrons are called `` nonphotonic electrons '' .",
