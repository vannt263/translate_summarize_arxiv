    "in its original version @xcite sph was formulated adopting a constant particle smoothing length ( spatial smoothing resolution length or resolving power ) @xmath0 , where the adopted interpolation kernel works , to perform free lagrangian gas dynamics .",
    "asph methods are currently adopted with the aim of performing better spatial interpolations mainly in expanding or in shock gas dynamics @xcite .",
    "high physical viscosity accretion discs are well - bound structures around the primary compact star even in low compressibility conditions @xcite .    in order to build up a well - bound accretion disc in inviscid conditions , the ejection rate at the disc s outer edge must be at least two or three times smaller than the accretion rate at the disc s inner edge",
    "whenever this condition is fulfilled , the disc s outer edge , as well as the whole disc , does not disperse in spite of high pressure forces which are also dependent on the gas compressibility : @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , low compressibility gases are naturally more easily sensitive to the loss of blobs of gas at the disc s outer edge itself , towards the empty external space , if the gravitational field is not able to keep disc gas in the gravitational potential well .",
    "such effects are enhanced and strongly evident in inviscid conditions @xcite and the moderate contribution of artificial viscosity terms does not prevent such effects . such a viscosity does not work like a true physical one since it operates only when different fluid components approach each other , being zero during fluid particle repulsion .",
    "high compressibility gas dynamics does not allow us to distinguish the truth regarding whether a technique is able to perform a correct fluid dynamics .",
    "in fact , in such a modelling , accretion discs would be formed anyway even in physically inviscid conditions @xcite and the role of kernel choice and of its resolving power are hidden .",
    "to stress such an idea , in this work a low compressibility @xmath2 polytropic index is adopted throughout , working with the same binary system parameters such as stellar masses and their separation and adopting the largest value ( @xmath3)as for the shakura and sunyaev viscosity prescription .    in this paper ,",
    "physically inviscid and viscid disc models are shown , where a more suitable gaussian - derived kernel formulation , as far as both transport mechanisms and expanding or collapsing gas dynamics are concerned , is adopted . throughout the accretion disc models ,",
    "the same supersonic mass transfer condition at l1 are adopted .",
    "the numerical scheme here adopted , as any other numerical method , is characterized by the assumed spatial smoothing resolution length @xmath0 .",
    "the mass and angular momentum radial transport is also affected by the sph particle smoothing resolution length @xmath0 .",
    "too small @xmath0 values prevent the radial transport , while large @xmath0 values produce a too effective radial transport of matter towards the centre of the gravitational potential well , as well as of angular momentum toward the disc s outer edge .",
    "a large @xmath0 ensures a high particle overlapping ( interpolation ) but at the same time it produces a strong particle repulsion rate due to pressure forces especially in low compressibility regimes on the disc s outer fe . on the contrary ,",
    "a too small smoothing resolution length @xmath0 compromises any fluid dynamic behaviour and shock handling .",
    "the artificial viscosity term prevents spurious heating and handles shocks as a `` shock capturing method '' .",
    "the artificial viscosity is a function of the smoothing resolution length itself or of some kind of spatial length .",
    "a too small @xmath0 value does not prevent particle interpenetration , destroying any fluid behaviour , because of lack of artificial viscosity . @xcite and @xcite",
    "discuss what we statistically define as a well - defined and bound accretion disc .",
    "as far as the numerical resolution is concerned , a number of disordered neighbour particles of the order of 10 ( more or less ) is considered , in principle , the minimum number of neighbours in order to achieve an adequate 3d numerical interpolation , although a number of neighbours larger than 30 is currently adopted to achieve a higher accuracy .",
    "this is the criterion we adopted to define a well - bound accretion disc .",
    "lesser neighbours for each particle are considered an unsuitable number as far as both interpolation efficiency and disc binding into the primary s gravitational potential well are concerned .    in the next sections , after discerning the artificial and the turbulent physical viscosities , we describe how asph techniques work and their limits when the viscous transport and/or fe conditions are involved , as well as why gaspher could be a solution .",
    "in particular , in  2 we compare how artificial and turbulent physical viscosities differently work ; in  3 we show how gaspher works and why it does not suffer of some sph and/or asph lack .",
    "at last , in  5 we report 3d accretion disc results showing some interesting features in our viscous simulations , whilst in  6 we discuss on the accuracy of sph - derived techniques . in the appendix , after showing the mathematical background underlying sph - derived schemes ( for readers knowing how sph and asph work , this mathematical section can be easily skipped without any difficulty , being instead essential for others ) , we also compare results of gaspher , sph and asph non viscous 1d and 2d selected tests . a comparison with analytical solutions is also given , whenever it is possible .",
    "in our physically viscous disc modelling , the shakura and sunyaev prescription @xcite is adopted with the largest @xmath3 value to stress numerical reliability of results @xcite . the sph formulation of viscous contributions in the navier - stokes and energy equations has been developed by @xcite .",
    "these goals are not obtained by artificial viscosity which is , however , introduced in both models to resolve shocks numerically and to avoid spurious heating .",
    "artificial viscosity vanishes when the limit value of the particle interpolation domain goes to zero .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the linear component of the artificial viscosity itself , in the continuum limit , yields a viscous shear force .",
    "in particular , the last two authors have explicitly formulated such an artificial viscosity contribution in the momentum and energy equations .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite found an analogy between the shear viscosity generated by the linear artificial viscosity term and the well - known shakura and sunyaev shear viscosity , in the continuum limit .",
    "sph method , like other finite difference schemes , is far from the continuum limit ; moreover we need the quadratic ( @xmath4 , von neumann - richtmyer - like viscosity ) artificial viscosity term to handle strong shocks .",
    "linear @xmath5 and quadratic @xmath4 artificial viscosity terms ( usually @xmath6 and sometimes , in some specific cases , @xmath7 ) are chosen @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in the viscous models ,",
    "the viscous force contribution is represented by the divergence of the symmetric viscous stress tensor in the navier - stokes equation . a symmetric combination of the symmetric shear tensor times the particle velocity has been added to the energy equation as a viscous heating contribution .",
    "the bulk physical viscosity contribution has not been considered for the sake of simplicity .",
    "artificial and turbulent physical viscosities are independent from each other .",
    "the artificial viscosity terms should be smaller than the physically viscous ones , otherwise the physical viscosity role would be negligible",
    ". the relevance of viscous forces could be even comparable to the gas pressure forces , especially if @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "an analytical formulation , describing the numerical artificial viscosity coefficient , is reported in @xcite : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the sound velocity . according to such a definition ,",
    "its ratio with the shakura - sunyaev viscosity coefficient @xmath12 is : @xmath13 , for each sph particle . for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the scale - height of the disc , @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that the role of artificial viscosity could be significant , compared to the physical viscosity role , if small @xmath17 and large @xmath0 values are taken into account . according to @xcite and to @xcite the shear viscosity @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "according to their results , the numerical artificial viscosity coefficient @xmath20 is even smaller if @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath22 . hence , for @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "this implies that , the role of artificial viscosity can be comparable to the role of a very low physical viscosity , because of the correlation between the sph artificial viscosity parameter @xmath5 and the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xmath25 is : @xmath26 without any bulk viscosity contribution and supposing gas incompressibility ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "notice that , according to these correlations , the shakura - sunyaev parameter @xmath25 ( non zero only for approaching particles ) is not the shakura - sunyaev viscous parameter @xmath17 for physically viscid gases , but the transformation of the artificial viscosity term into the shakura - sunyaev formalism .",
    "such results show that the gas compressibility has a relevant role since the physical viscosity mainly works when the density varies on a length - scale of the order of the velocity length - scale , not only as a bulk viscosity , but also as a shear viscosity .",
    "moreover , notice that the assumption of an adaptive @xmath0 sph or a constant @xmath0 sph could also have a role both in artificial viscosity and in physical viscosity roles .",
    "these results show that the role of a fully viscous fluid dynamics is still far from any conclusion and that physical assumptions as well as numerical hypotheses and boundary conditions are also determinant .",
    "as for viscous gas hydrodynamics , the relevant equations to our model are :    @xmath28    @xmath29 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{\\rho } \\nabla \\cdot \\bmath{\\tau } \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\hfill \\mbox{navier - stokes momentum equation } % \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    the most of the adopted symbols have the usual meaning : @xmath34 stands for the lagrangian derivative , @xmath35 is the gas density , @xmath36 is the thermal energy per unit mass , @xmath37 is the effective gravitational potential generated by the two stars and @xmath38 is the angular velocity of the rotating reference frame , corresponding to the rotational period of the binary system .",
    "self - gravitation has not been included , as it appears irrelevant .",
    "the adiabatic index @xmath39 has the meaning of a numerical parameter whose value lies in the range between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in principle .",
    "@xmath42 is the viscous stress tensor , whose presence modifies the euler equations for a non viscous fluid dynamics in the viscous navier - stokes equations .",
    "in its original formulation @xcite gaussian kernels @xmath43 as :    @xmath44    have been adopted in sph , where @xmath45 represents the module of the radial distance between particles @xmath46 and @xmath47 . also , an example of `` super gaussian kernel '' @xcite has also been described .",
    "even a factorization of gaussian kernels for each dimension has also been adopted @xcite in an asph formulation , adopting 3d ellipsoid kernel geometry to achieve a higher accuracy , according to an anisotropic @xmath48-dependent spatial particle concentrations ; or according to the mean particle spacing , as it varies in time , space , and direction around each particle @xcite .",
    "kernels based on cubic splines since the end of the 80 s @xcite have also widely been adopted . typically , in 3d ,",
    "such cubic spline kernels @xmath49 are in the form :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 .",
    "the hidden problem is whether asph , as previously formulated , are effective whatever is the compressibility regime considered , especially when fe conditions are adopted on the edges of the particle envelope .",
    "high compressibility gas dynamics prevents us from distinguishing the truth regarding whether a sph - like technique is able to perform a correct fluid dynamics , since accretion discs would be formed anyway even in physically inviscid conditions . in this case , the roles of the kernel choice and of its resolving power are hidden .",
    "gas loss effects in low compressibility conditions naturally develop , especially at the disc s outer edge , because of the pushing action towards the outer space of particles just below the disc s surfaces and below the disc s outer edge , if the gravitational field is not able to keep gas particles in the gravitational potential well . in asph",
    "interpolation particle domains swell at both free edges ( inner and outer ) .",
    "normally , in an accretion disc , the density is a decreasing function of the radial distance from the central star .",
    "this implies that particle adaptive @xmath0 should decrease towards the inner disc bulk , without any restriction imposed on the number of particle neighbours .",
    "problems deriving from the inadequacy of artificial viscosity role and the particle interpolation / interpenetration could be relevant .",
    "even the choice of a threshold value for @xmath52 as a lower limit would be arbitrary and no differences would appear in results compared to classical sph results , adopting the same @xmath53 .",
    "if asph is adopted , even restricting the particle neighbours to a fixed number in its conservative form , the behaviour of @xmath0 for each particle is contrary , swelling also within the disc bulk and producing enhanced gas loss effects at the disc s outer edge and on the disc surfaces , in spite of the viscosity eventually introduced , as well as a draining effect of the disc s inner edge toward the central compact star due to a stressed radial transport .    whenever and wherever spatial isotropy and homogeneity hold , a modulation of spatial smoothing resolution length does not affect results , in principle , in so far as @xmath0 is large enough to prevent particle interpenetration and neighbour particles are enough to allow good interpolations",
    "however , the situation is rather different if spatial gradients exist .",
    "it is quite normal that a smaller threshold limit @xmath52 is imposed on particle @xmath0 because problems on the ineffectiveness of artificial viscosity in handling shock fronts would arise if @xmath54 , together with a too short time step computed according to the friedrich - courant - lewy conditions .",
    "artificial viscosity vanishes when the limit value of the particle interpolation domain goes to zero , due to the fact that in its analytical expression it is linearly dependent on the smoothing length @xmath0 .",
    "its role , limited to a filing effect , should not be dominant compared to gas pressure terms .",
    "therefore such condition is fully altered if , according to eqs .",
    "( 18 , 19 ) , @xmath55 , see app",
    ". a. other formulations of artificial viscosity , depending on particle mutual distance @xmath56 @xcite , do not modify the problem . therefore , asph results would be deeply influenced by a dominant role of artificial terms if such a condition is mostly realized in sonic and subsonic regimes and/or in progressive turbulent rarefying regimes .",
    "some authors @xcite handle artificial viscosity switching it off , especially in low density conditions , when particle @xmath0 increases or in high temperature conditions when particle sound velocity is subsonic . as a result",
    ", the switching on / off of the artificial viscosity limits its role , but low density sonic and subsonic conditions stay still be critical .    in both situations ,",
    "the problem of a correct hydrodynamics involves not only the bulk of the gas structure in the computational domain , but mainly the physics of the fe of the computational domain .",
    "in particular the outer one for gas expansion problems and the inner one for collapse problems .    as for physically viscous asph simulations , mass and angular momentum transport",
    "are deeply affected by the @xmath0 particle smoothing resolution length .",
    "we expect a higher particle transport when particle @xmath0 statistically increases and the opposite effect when @xmath0 statistically decreases . in a low compressibility regime",
    ", @xcite showed that physical turbulent viscosity hampers particle repulsion , due to pressure forces , contributing to accretion disc consistency and limiting particle loss at the disc s outer edge .",
    "however , if particle smoothing resolution length @xmath0 increases in asph , and radial transport becomes unnaturally too much effective , the opposite effect arises so much that the inner edge of the disc could be indefinite .      in gaspher modelling , a radial gaussian - derived kernel , related to the well - known `` error function '' with a constant smoothing length @xmath0 equivalent to its hwhm",
    "is considered :    @xmath57    in such a kernel we stress that its interpolation radial extension is unlimited , although its typical smoothing length @xmath0 is spatially and permanently constant . in gaspher , to collect an adequate particle neighbours number is not a problem because of the unlimited spatial extension of its kernel . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the three interpolation kernels give the same interpolation integrals for 1d flows , as well as the last two kernels give the same interpolation integrals for 2d flows .",
    "the origin of this kernel function relies in the well known `` error function '' :    @xmath58    whose `` complementary error function '' is :    @xmath59    for @xmath60 ,    @xmath61    for @xmath60 , @xmath62 equals the zero order gaussian integral :    @xmath63    in performing 3d integral ,    @xmath64    hence , @xmath65 .",
    "also @xmath66 , as well as @xmath67 , this last , considering the well known properties of gaussian integrals : @xmath68 , and in particular @xmath69 .",
    "fig . 1 displays , @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as well as @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are significant for 3d integrations .",
    "1 displays the much better gaspher interpolation capabilities , with respect to the current sph or asph techniques using other kernels , not only because 3d interpolations are more weighted toward @xmath80 , but also because @xmath81 as it should be , avoiding the well known `` particle pairing instability '' effect , affecting the other two behaviours ( @xmath82 displays a minimum for @xmath83 ) . in the conversion from mathematical integrals to computational summations in 3d ,",
    "the role of @xmath84 is equivalent to @xmath85 .",
    "thus , wherever @xmath86 , and spatial gradients exist , the effectiveness of the adopted interpolation kernel comes out . in the resolution of the euler or of the navier stokes equations ,",
    "spatial derivatives have to be calculated . in the calculation of @xmath87 in the momentum equation",
    ", two particles can not coincide because the pressure force is physically infinite .",
    "moreover , also for the @xmath88 in the energy equation or in the continuity equation , this non physical case should be carefully avoided because no velocity divergence can exist if particle mutual separation is zero .",
    "summing up , both indexes @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in the unrealistic case of @xmath91 , spatial derivatives to compute gradients or divergences can be bypassed because unphysical . in the case of a very short particle mutual separation",
    ", natural computational difficulties can arise only for a very small particle separation .",
    "this is unavoidable when a very high compression characterize the fluid , because calculated pressure and individual pressure forces are always naturally very high .",
    "however , in particular for accretion or collapse processes , the particle merging in a new particle , created at the centre of mass , conserving mass , energy and momentum could be the best solution .",
    "this is a useful physical expedient , also used in asph , whenever a strong gas compression occurs .",
    "it avoids a too short explicit time step calculation , according to the well known friedrich - courant - lewy .",
    "in particular , for asph technique only , it also avoids any artificial viscosity inadequacy in handling shocks .",
    "such an allowed expedient could be correctly also used in gaspher in such conditions .",
    "7 ) , @xmath71 ( eq .",
    "6 ) , as well as of gaspher @xmath72 ( eq . 8) .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , as well as the radial derivatives times @xmath92 both useful for 3d calculations are also reported.,width=302,height=302 ]    we pay attention that in 3d interpolations , it is not the role of the kernel @xmath93 that it is important . instead , it is the @xmath94 that is to be taken into account , as fig .",
    "1 clearly displays . hence , on @xmath95 particle , when @xmath80 , @xmath94 converges toward a finite value .",
    "if this is the explanation regarding the continuum limit , in the spatial discretization , this role is carried out by the particle density @xmath96 which , in the sph formulation @xmath97 , divides @xmath98 . only when @xmath80 gaspher formulation becomes : @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , whenever @xmath80 the concept of dimension is meaningless .",
    "this implies that , if @xmath80 , and especially if @xmath91 , the 1d formulation of kernel can also be taken into account to simplify computational complications in some selected cases , whenever the 2d or the 3d fluid kinematics flows along one selected direction .",
    "this kernel choice resolves the problem of neighbours inadequacy , as well as the problem of the sph and asph `` particle pairing instability '' for @xmath100 due to the fact that when @xmath80 , @xmath101 does not become infinite .    for practical reasons in computational resources , even a limitation to several @xmath0 of the order of @xmath102 with @xmath103",
    "could be considered with very small modifications in results , keeping constant the resolving power @xmath0 of all particles .",
    "in fact , theoretically considering a homogeneous and isotropic 3d particle distribution , if @xmath104 ( where @xmath105 is the particle concentration ) is the number of neighbours closer than @xmath0 for each ith particle , it increases up to @xmath106 i.e. up to @xmath107 times .",
    "alternatively , neighbours can be limited to a selected number ( @xmath108 in our 3d models ) . in both cases , a very small modifications in results , neglecting further interpolating particles ,",
    "is made because the most important neighbours in the interpolation are the closest ones . in this case , if neighbours are a large number , due to a very high particle concentration , it is easily possible to merge more particles in a single new particle , created at the centre of mass , conserving mass , energy and momentum .",
    "so doing , the asph s risk to decrease the spatial smoothing resolution length to values involving an ineffective artificial viscosity behaviour , as well as the danger to get a too small computed time step in the courant - friedrich - lewy condition when @xmath54 , are avoided . a fixed number of neighbours can be a serious risk by limiting the interaction to @xmath109 neighbours only the inner `` flat part '' of the kernel contributes to sph sums . a large contribution from other particles outside this `` flat part '' would be wrongly neglected . in gaspher",
    "this does not occur because the kernel slope is not `` flat '' for @xmath80 , instead @xmath110 .",
    "of course , also asph techniques try to avoid the unpleasant `` particle pairing instability '' .",
    "however , the particle resolving power @xmath0 can not decrease too much in regions of very high particle concentrations otherwise the artificial dissipation due to the artificial viscosity does not work well . moreover , at the same time , the time step explicitly computed according to the friedrich - courant - lewy condition becomes too short if @xmath54 .",
    "the possibility of adopting a numerical sph code , including the physical viscosity @xcite , considering @xcite results , makes us able to answer the problem whether asph s and/or gaspher methods are reliable in improving fluid dynamics compared to the original sph , where the smoothing length @xmath0 is constant .",
    "although some authors @xcite adopted gaussian kernels , their methods belong to the asph numerical schemes where a spatially and temporarily variable smoothing length @xmath0 is adopted .",
    "although many efforts try to conciliate a reliable adaptive interpolation technique with computational resources , asph methods are unsatisfactory in describing a correct gas dynamics because hidden numerical errors exist inside an adaptive interpolation , better revealed in a viscous transport process inside a definite potential well .",
    "all asph s difficulties in handling the artificial viscosity dominant role in subsonic and/or expanding regimes , as discussed before , are prevented in gaspher by the fact that the particle resolving power @xmath0 is constant and equal to hwhm of spatially unlimited gaussian kernels .",
    "gaspher technique limits the problem of particle disorder in computing particle @xmath88 , as discussed in @xcite and in @xcite as far as shear flows are concerned because , even considering disordered flows , particle disorder is tamed by gaspher extended interacting particle domains .",
    "in fact , the longer the particle interpolation range , the better the computational result , without any modification of particle resolving power @xmath0 .",
    "finally , an adequate fixed smoothing resolution length @xmath0 allows us to resolve gas turbulence within the confined integration domain even in low compressibility regimes . in non viscous conditions the local reynolds number @xmath111 , considering @xmath112 , @xmath113 @xcite and , more stressing , @xmath114 considering @xmath115 @xcite , because of @xmath116 . being the whole disc structure typically supersonic , even for @xmath2 , @xmath117 .",
    "hence , a moderate turbulence is effective in non viscous @xmath39 conditions , where gas collisions are relevant . instead in viscous conditions , in the shakura and sunyaev formulations , no turbulence is recorded .",
    "if an adaptive method is adopted in low compressibility conditions , the increasing of the smoothing resolution length @xmath0 , up to an order of magnitude , prevents any turbulence resolution in an accretion disc , even for supersonic regimes .",
    "the evaluation of the minimum linear dimensions of the integration domain , able to solve turbulence adopting an @xmath17 parameter of the order of @xmath118 , gives a value of the order @xmath119 in order to get a reynolds number @xmath120 , the smaller value is for supersonic regimes .",
    "the integration domain ( the length of the primary s potential well ) of the order of @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , how to handle an adaptive sph with the problem of solving the turbulence is a real difficulty , and the adopted fixed @xmath0 is correct in order to solve this problem .",
    "larger ( and adaptive ) @xmath0 values are in open conflict with @xmath119 in order to solve turbulence .",
    "these conclusions on turbulence in accretion discs having free edge boundaries are not those concerning the concept of turbulence wherever fixed static boundaried are considered .",
    "whenever particles move within a confined box , both sph and asph results are traditionally correct in so far as @xmath122 is not too small . in this case",
    "the problem regards the particle chaotic collisions in a close environment where the particle mean free path is less than two or three times the particle smoothing resolution length .",
    "looking at our sph results in a physically viscous low compressibility regime @xcite as a reference , where the particle smoothing length is constant and a typical cubic spline function as a smoothing function have been assumed , we systematically perform a series of gaspher simulations with the aim of getting a physically viscous well - bound accretion disc in a close binary .",
    "we show that such transport phenomenology , in a low compressibility regime , is significant in deciding the reliability of the adopted kernel formulation for sph fluid dynamics simulations , especially whenever free edge boundary conditions must be taken into account .",
    "the characteristics of the binary system are determined by the masses of the two companion stars and their separation .",
    "we chose to model a system in which the mass @xmath123 of the primary compact star and the mass @xmath124 of the secondary normal star are equal to @xmath125 and their mutual separation is @xmath126 .",
    "the primary s potential well is totally empty at the beginning of each simulation at time @xmath127 .",
    "the injection gas velocity at l1 is fixed to @xmath128 while the injection gas temperature at l1 is fixed to @xmath129 , taking into account , as a first approximation , the radiative heating of the secondary surface due to lightening of the disc .",
    "gas compressibility is fixed by the adiabatic index @xmath2 .",
    "supersonic kinematic conditions at l1 are discussed in @xcite , especially when active phases of cb s are considered .",
    "however , results of this paper are to be considered as a useful test to check whether disc structures ( viscous and non ) show the expected behaviour .",
    "the reference frame is that centred on the primary compact star and corotating , whose rotational period , normalized to @xmath130 , coincide with the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "this explain why in the momentum equation ( eq .",
    "2 ) , we also include the coriolis and the centrifugal accelerations .    in our models",
    "the unknowns are : pressure , density , temperature , velocity , therefore we solve the continuity , momentum , energy , and state ( perfect gas ) equations . in order to make our equations dimensionless",
    ", we adopt the following normalization factors : @xmath131 for masses , @xmath132 for lengths , @xmath133 for speeds , so that the orbital period is normalized to @xmath130 , @xmath134 for the density , @xmath135 for pressure , @xmath136 for thermal energy per unit mass and @xmath137 for temperature , where @xmath138 is the proton mass and @xmath139 is the boltzman constant .",

    "although disc structure and dynamics are altered near the inner edge , these alterations are relatively small because they are counterbalanced by a high particle concentration close to the inner edge in supersonic injection models .",

    "this implies that numerical simulations , limited only to explosive or collapse short time tests , would not be reliable in testing asph codes . therefore , once more , this conclusion strengthens numerical tests and simulations based on a transport mechanism .",
    "physical viscosity naturally works where the particle mutual velocities ( and separations ) change in time , namely when a mutual acceleration exists , contrasting gas dynamics ( rarefaction or compression ) and converting kinetic energy in thermal energy .",

    "physical viscosity plays a role in regions where particle velocity gradients are significant .",
    "this means that physical viscosity plays a relevant role mainly in the radial transport , while it has scarce influence on the tangential dynamics .",

    "the larger number of disc particles are still affected by a gas chaotic collisional component on top of the spiral disc s kinematics . moreover , the reynolds number increases because of the reduction of the particle smoothing resolution length , from @xmath140 to @xmath178 . instead , whichever is the gaspher adopted particle smoothing resolution length @xmath0 , in a viscous regime , both the radial transport of mass and angular momentum , as well as the radial temperature profile , are not sensitive to any adopted particle resolving power as figg .",

    "from the astrophysical point of view , our results show that in gaspher modelling , where particle interpolation radial extension is conceptually unlimited - although particle smoothing length @xmath0 is spatially and permanently constant - solve the problem of neighbours inadequacy .",
    "moreover , physical viscosity supports the development of a well - bound accretion disc in the primary potential well , even in the case of a low compressibility gas dynamics .",
    "such results , also shown in @xcite , mean , once more , that the initial angular momentum injection conditions at the disc s outer edge are responsible for the disc tangential dynamics , while viscosity is mainly responsible for the thermodynamical disc properties , even for low compressibility disc models ( @xmath184 , here @xmath2 ) when gas loss effects are physically expected according to the low compressibility gas dynamics and to the low stellar mass of the central accretor .",
    "moreover , in gaspher viscous fluid dynamics , further details of the flow are revealed ( e. g. the coming out of spiral patterns in disc structures ) .    from the numerical point of view",
    ", reliable results are reproduced in a gaspher , despite fe conditions are adopted . without considering the injected particle stream , such simulations could also be considered as accretion and transport general tests within a gravitational potential well .",

    "the transformation of sph codes in a gaspher code , without further numerical efforts , seems likely to be an interesting future challenge .",
    "as far as the computational cpu time is concerned , there is not conceptually any disadvantage in such transformation , if particle neighbours are fixed ( e.g. @xmath185 or @xmath186 ) for each particle , by the introduction of a boundaries counter / limiter because the number of particle neighbours rules the computational cpu time .",
    "the necessity to perform better sph numerical interpolations on contact surfaces , or at fe layers , recently inspired authors to develop sph - derived techniques to achieve a higher accuracy .",
    "an sph dynamic refinement has recently been developed by @xcite to calculate boundary contact forces in fluid flow problems through boundary particle splitting .",
    "such a technique could also be very interesting and competitive in solving fe problems .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we conclude that although high compressibility inviscid results among different schemes could compare with each other especially if constraints are imposed on boundaries of the computational domain , differences arise either if fe and/or if viscous flows are involved . in such conditions , gaspher technique shows a regular behaviour and better conserve the total energy , as well as reduces the influence of the artificial viscosity for non viscous ideal shear flows free of any gas compression ( see appendix ) .",
    "computational cpu time is mainly governed by the number of neighbour particles for each particle .",

    "whenever in a shocktube the ratios @xmath285 , and consequently @xmath286 , and @xmath287 , such a discontinuity is called a `` blast wave '' .",
    "being @xmath280 at the beginning of each simulation , the adimensional temporal unity is chosen as previously written in the 1d sod shocktube test before .",
    "in such a situation , the mach number spans from @xmath288 to @xmath289 values up to @xmath290 or more at the first instant .",
    "b3 displays a comparison of sph and gaspher results with the so called analytical solution , after a considerable time evolution at time @xmath291 .",
    "the analytical solution is considered corrected in so far as @xmath292 . in the blast wave test here",
    "considered , @xmath293 , while other spatial , initial and boundary conditions , as well as the particle spatial smoothing resolution length are identical to those chosen in the previous test .",
    "b3 displays that sph and gaspher results globally compare with each other and that they also compare with the analytical solution wherever @xmath292 , that is wherever the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions hold . beyond this limit",
    ", even the so called analytical solution is considered incorrect .",
    "being @xmath2 , the comparison is meaningful within @xmath294 .",
    "gaspher profiles suffer of a lesser instability in those regions where particle concentration is larger , close to discontinuity profiles , where horizontal plateaus are more regular .",
    "in particular such behaviour can be addressed to the absence of any particle pair instability because of the analytical expression of the gaspher adopted kernel and to its radial spatial derivative .",
    "the test here discussed does not have an analytical solution .",
    "however , it is interesting because it shows how pressure forces push away the free edge of the fluid computational domain , without any explicit dissipation , according to the chosen interpolation kernel .",
    "being in permanent gradual expansion , any artificial viscosity contribution is statistically turned off , apart some contribution due to the shear flow close to the two marginal vertical fixed edges .",
    "the box is a square @xmath295 , having three fixed sides : two vertical unlimited sides ( left - right ) , at @xmath296 $ ] and at @xmath297 $ ] , and the horizontal one at the bottom from @xmath298 to @xmath299 , while the fourth side at @xmath300 , is free to expand towards the outer space .",
    "particles , whose mass @xmath301 are regularly located so that their mutual separation equals @xmath0 .",
    "the initial thermal energy is @xmath302 , while the initial @xmath303 throughout .",
    "the three fixed edges are composed of two lines of fixed particles , whose velocity is abruptly put to zero time by time .",
    "notice that the above mentioned constraints have to be considered as geometric conditions not pertinent only to the edge particles of the square box . in this way , particles can move only toward the @xmath304 direction , from @xmath305 onwards , and any particle horizontal translation is mechanically prevented .       averaged for each particle for the sph , asph and gaspher simulations of the 2d expansion of the free edge in a box .",
    "@xmath306 values are expressed in @xmath307 units .",
    "time @xmath151 is reported on a logarithmic scale.,width=302,height=302 ]    since an analytical solution is unknown , we pay attention to the conservation of the total energy @xmath308 per unit mass averaged for each particle and , at the same time to the regular face of the expansion of the free horizontal edge at the top .",
    "b4 displays the advance of the free front at three selected times for the sph , asph and gaspher simulations .",
    "sph and particularly asph fronts are without any doubt more advanced than the gaspher front .",
    "this effect is the result of an incorrect computation of the pressure forces on the free edge of the computational domain as discussed in  5 .",
    "this conclusion is stressed not only by the fact that the gaspher flow is more regular and free from defects , but also , as it is shown in fig .",
    "b5 , by the fact that the total energy per unit mass @xmath306 is much better conserved than in the other two cases . as an order of magnitude ,",
    "the degradation of the total energy is @xmath309 for a totality of @xmath310 particles after a time @xmath311 for both sph and asph .",
    "this involves that on a single particle , @xmath312 .",
    "instead , in gaspher this energy degradation is @xmath313 times smaller .",
    "this implies that the choice of the interpolation kernel is crucial in the conservation of prime integrals .",
    "the 2d radial spread and migration of an isothermal keplerian annulus ring is widely described in @xcite in the case of a constant physical viscosity @xmath314 . at time @xmath127 , the surface density , as a function of the radial distance @xmath315 , is described by a dirac @xmath316 function : @xmath317 , where @xmath318 is the mass of the entire ring and @xmath319 is its initial radius . as a function also of time ,",
    "the surface density is computed via standard methods as a function of the modified bessel function @xmath320 :      where @xmath322 , @xmath323 .",
    "@xmath324 const equals the annulus mass throughout .",
    "time is normalized so that @xmath325 is the keplerian period corresponding to the ring at @xmath326 .",
    "examples of sph viscous spread on this argument can be found in @xcite , as well as in @xcite in sph physically inviscid hydrodynamics on the basis that the shear dissipation in non viscous flows can be compared to physical dissipation @xcite . in particular",
    "an exhaustive comparison can also be found in @xcite .    in a non viscous particle lagrangian",
    "fluid dynamics , any deviation from the initial strictly keplerian kinematics is incorrectly due to the activation of artificial viscosity dissipation in the shear flow when two particles approach each other .",
    "this is an unavoidable consequence of the fact that dissipation is currently used to handle the direct head - on collision between pair of particles . to establish whether the adopted kernel has a significant role in the spatial transport phenomena",
    ", any gas pressure force component must be removed leaving active only the artificial viscosity dissipation in the momentum equation in a strictly isothermal fluid dynamics .",
    "thus , the whole flow should keep its keplerian behaviour because pressure forces are artificiously erased , in so far as artificial viscosity dissipation stays inactive . in this test ,",
    "the two marginal edges of the annulus ( the inner and the outer ones ) are considered as fe boundaries .",
    "adopting the same artificial viscosity formulation and the same parameters ( @xmath327 and @xmath328 - see app .",
    "a ) both for sph and for asph and for gaspher simulations , our aim is to check which technique shows the smaller deviation from the initial keplerian tight particle distribution in isothermal conditions , keeping constant both the sound velocity and the specific thermal energy .",
    "sph - derived techniques turns on the artificial viscosity dissipation whenever two close particles approach with each other .",
    "this happens also for shear flows .",
    "however for inviscid ideal shear flows this is an incorrect result without any gas compression .    a significant comparison of gaspher to sph and to asph is displayed in fig .",
    "b6 , where @xmath329 density contour map plots are shown at the same @xmath330 .",
    "the radial distributions of surface density are displayed in fig .",
    "b7 , according to the restricted hypotheses of the standard mechanism of physical dissipation ( constant dissipation , zero initial thickness ) . as in @xcite ,",
    "the initial ring radius is at @xmath326 , whose thickness is @xmath331 , is composed of @xmath332 equal mass ( @xmath333 ) pressureless keplerian ( @xmath334 , @xmath27 at @xmath127 ) sph particles , with @xmath335 , with @xmath336 , and with initial density radial distribution corresponding to the analytical solution at time @xmath151 , whose @xmath337 . to this purpose",
    ", a random number generator has been used .",
    "the central accretor has mass normalized to @xmath338 .",
    "the kinematic shear dissipation is estimated @xcite as @xmath113 .",
    "gaspher radial spread is without any doubt the narrower one , while the asph one is naturally the larger because of the increasing particle smoothing resolution length @xmath0 affecting the artificial viscosity analytical expression .",
    "for this reason , its physical dissipation counterpart @xmath113 can not be kept constant even preventing any disc heating . only in the case of asph modelling",
    ", the initial @xmath0 value is assumed to compute @xmath330 .",
    "notice that these results are obtained according to the correlation @xmath113 @xcite in the expression where @xmath323 , which appears as the most appropriate .",
    "in fact , considering @xmath339 @xcite with @xmath222 , it is necessary a time @xmath151 ten times longer to get the same @xmath330 .",
    "this involves a larger annulus spread as far as the numerical results are concerned .",
    "according to this results , the kernel choice is determinant also in the generation of kinematic deviations from the initial keplerian distribution due to the incorrect sph dissipation because of the particle shear approaching in the non viscous ideal flows .",
    "notice that the density radial distribution , as far as the asph modelling is concerned , better fits the spread of the theoretical radial distribution ( here not represented ) .",
    "this is a fair result in so far as we are interested in determining which artificial dissipation , coupled with the choice of the interpolation kernel , determines a density radial profile , to be compared with the theoretical one , when a physical dissipation @xmath314 is considered .",
    "however , this is another aspect , regarding the study of either the physical dissipation in a viscous fluid dynamics or its artificial numerical dissipation counterpart in a non viscous approach , which is far from the scope of the test here proposed .",
