    "the space @xmath27 is the zero level set of the momentum map for the left diagonal action on the right imploded product of cotangent bundles .",

    "the equivalence relation of @xmath2-congruence can be defined analogously for any triangulation of @xmath38 ( equivalently any trivalent tree with @xmath3-leaves ) and induces an equivalence relation on @xmath33 ( and many other spaces associated to spaces of @xmath3-gons in @xmath9 , for example , the space of @xmath3-gons itself or the space of @xmath3-gon linkages ) .",

    "we next describe the space @xmath60 that will be proved later to be homeomorphic to the toric fiber @xmath61 .",

    "the result in the previous theorem was conjectured by philip foth and yi hu in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the above construction becomes more clear once we introduce the bending flows of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lengths of the @xmath41 diagonals created are continuous functions on @xmath5 and are smooth where they are not zero .",
    "they give rise to hamiltonian flows which were called _ bending flows _ in @xcite . the bending flow associated to a given diagonal has the following description .",
    "the part of the @xmath3-gon to one side of the diagonal does not move , while the other part rotates around the diagonal at constant speed .",
    "the lengths of the diagonals are action variables which generate the bending flows , the conjugate angle variables are the dihedral angles between the fixed and moving parts .",
    "however _ the bending flow along the @xmath47-th diagonal is not defined at those @xmath3-gons where the @xmath47-th diagonal is zero_. if the bending flows are everywhere defined ( for example if one of the side - lengths is much larger than the rest ) then we may apply the theorem of delzant , @xcite to conclude that @xmath5 is toric .",
    "however for many @xmath6 ( including the case of regular @xmath3 -gons ) the bending flows are not everywhere defined .",
    "the point of @xcite was to make the bending flows well - defined by dividing out the subspaces of @xmath67 where a collection of @xmath47 diagonals vanish by @xmath68 .",
    "we illustrate their construction with two examples .",
    "first , let @xmath69 so @xmath5 is the space of regular hexagons with side - lengths all equal to @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath70 be the subspace of @xmath5 where the middle ( second ) diagonal vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath70 is the space of `` bowties '' ( see figure [ fig : bowties ] ) modulo the diagonal action of @xmath11 on the two equilateral triangles .",
    "we can no longer bend on the second diagonal because we have no axis of rotation . passing to @xmath2-congruence classes",
    "collapses the space @xmath70 to a point by dividing by the action of @xmath71 .",
    "bending along the second diagonal fixes this point by definition .    for our second example , we consider the space of regular octagons with all side - lengths equal to @xmath34 and the subspace @xmath72 where the middle diagonal vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath72 is the space of wedges of rhombi modulo the diagonal action of @xmath11 on the two rhombi , see figure [ fig : tworhombi ] . passing to @xmath2-congruence classes",
    "amounts to dividing by the action of @xmath71 on the two rhombi .",
    "we obtain the action of the bending flows on @xmath55 as follows . in this case",
    "we will be given a lift of the one - parameter group bending along a diagonal to @xmath21 .",
    "the one parameter group acts through its quotient in @xmath11 by bending along the diagonal .",
    "if an edge moves under this bending then the imploded spin - frame is moved by the one - parameter group in @xmath21 in the same way .",
    "hence , one part of the imploded spin - framed polygon is fixed and the other moves by a `` rigid motion '' i.e .",
    "all the spin - framed edges of the second part are moved by the same one - parameter group in @xmath21 .",
    "the bendings give rise to an action of an @xmath41 torus @xmath73 on @xmath59 .",
    "there are also  edge - rotations  that apply a one - parameter group to the imploded spin - frame but do not move the edge .",
    "this action on frames is the action of the torus @xmath30 coming from the theory of the imploded cotangent bundle of @xmath32 .",
    "this action is not faithful , the diagonal subtorus acts trivially .",
    "the bendings together with the edge rotations give rise to an action of a compact @xmath74 torus @xmath75 .",
    "the main step in proving theorems [ firstmaintheorem ] and [ secondmaintheorem ] is to produce a space @xmath76 that `` interpolates '' between @xmath55 and @xmath77 .",
    "our construction of @xmath76 was motivated by the construction of the toric degeneration of @xmath21-character varieties of fundamental groups of surfaces given by hurtubise and jeffrey in @xcite .",
    "the connection is that the space @xmath5 can be interpreted as the ( relative ) character variety of the fundamental group of the @xmath3-punctured two - sphere with values in the translation subgroup of the euclidean group @xmath78 - a small loop around the @xmath47-th puncture maps to translations by the @xmath47-th edge of the polygon ( considered as a vector in @xmath9 ) .",
    "take the triangulated model ( convex planar ) @xmath3-gon @xmath38 and break it apart into @xmath79 triangles @xmath80 .",
    "equivalently we break apart the dual tree @xmath2 into a forest @xmath81 consisting of @xmath79 tripods .",
    "attach to each of the @xmath82 edges of the @xmath79 triangles ( or each edge of the forest @xmath81 ) a copy of @xmath83 .",
    "now right - implode each copy of @xmath83 so that a copy of @xmath84 , the imploded cotangent bundle of @xmath21 , is attached to each edge . since @xmath85 admits an action of the circle ( from the right ) and @xmath21 from the left the resulting space admits an action of a torus @xmath86 of dimension @xmath82 and a commuting action of @xmath87 .",
    "the torus has a product decomposition @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the product of factors corresponding to the @xmath3 edges of the polygon @xmath38 and @xmath90 is the product of factors corresponding to the @xmath41 diagonals of @xmath38 .",
    "note that each diagonal of @xmath38 occurs in two triangles so corresponds to two edges of @xmath81 .",
    "hence each diagonal gives rise to a two - torus @xmath91 in @xmath92 which we will refer to as the two - torus corresponding to that diagonal .",
    "define a subtorus @xmath93 of @xmath90 of dimension @xmath41 by taking an antidiagonal embedding of @xmath94 in each two - torus corresponding to a diagonal .",
    "now take the symplectic quotient ( at level zero ) of ( the product of ) the three copies of @xmath95 associated to the three sides of each triangle by @xmath21 acting diagonally .",
    "for each triangle ( or each tripod ) we obtain a resulting copy of @xmath96 .",
    "the resulting product @xmath97 has an induced action of the torus @xmath86 .",
    "glue the copies @xmath98 associated to the triangles together along the edges of the triangles associated to diagonals by taking the symplectic quotient at level zero by the torus @xmath99 described above .",
    "each of the two previous symplectic quotients has a corresponding git quotient . taking both git quotients",
