    "over the past decade , the extraction of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) from experimental data has been one of the main goals of intermediate energy heavy ion collisions .",

    ". the properties of the mean field are crucial to such calculations and can also be directly related to the nuclear equation of state .",
    "some effort has been devoted to obtain realistic nuclear mean fields that could be used in practice within such numerical approaches .    early on in microscopic analyses , it appeared that the data on nuclear flow , as characterized by transverse momentum plots  @xcite and flow angle distributions  @xcite demanded an equation of state with a high compressibility coefficient ( k @xmath2 380 mev ) @xcite .",
    "however , it was later shown that if a reasonable momentum dependence was introduced in the nuclear mean field , a lower compressibility would be favored in the interpretation of the experimental data @xcite . in fact , pan and danielewicz  @xcite have recently shown that flow data for asymmetric systems could differentiate between a hard momentum ",

    "dependent eos , favoring the latter .",

    "previously @xcite , two of them were chosen arbitrarily : the momentum scale @xmath12 = 400 mev and @xmath13 .",
    "this exponent has an especially large influence on the nuclear equation of state compressibility coefficient , k. we further required the following at the saturation density : ( i ) the effective mass @xmath14 was set to 0.7 at the fermi surface , and ( ii ) the total energy per nucleon was adjusted to reproduce the volume term of the semi  empirical mass formula , e / a = @xmath1516 mev .",

    "it then follows that @xmath23 and that the effective mass @xmath14  =  0.67 , at the fermi surface .",
    "the agreement of @xmath24 with the real part of the optical potential as extracted from experiment is remarkable , at both low and high energies @xcite . to clarify the origins of these parametrizations , we state here that a yukawa interaction would have a mean field",

    "the value of @xmath27 has important consequences for the modelling of nuclear collisions at high energies , as we shall see .    in this work , for the sake of consistence and for the purpose of a quantitative comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite , we reset the five constants in our gbd and our mdyi potentials . for both parametrizations",
    "we require that @xmath28 , e / a = @xmath1516 mev , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 = 0.67 .",
    "we then obtain k = 210 mev , for both potentials .",
    "we call these the new mdyi ( nmdyi ) and new gbd ( ngbd ) , respectively , to distinguish these new parameter sets from the previous ones .",
    "we further note that both ngbd and nmdyi give a similar excellent fit of the high energy optical potential ( defined at saturation density ) , a desirable and important feature .",
    "if one neglects the momentum  dependent term , which means c=0 , the mean field is a function of the nuclear density @xmath32 alone .",
    "this simple skyrme parametrization has the form ( making the @xmath33 dependence implicit ) : @xmath34 we may thus further define two additional parameter sets .",
    "the first is a hard potential ( k  =  373  mev ) and the second a soft potential ( k  =  200 mev ) . the parameters for the gbd , mdyi , ngbd , nmdyi , and momentum  independent hard and soft potentials are summarized in table 1 , together with a hard mdyi potential(hm ) , which has k = 373 mev . note that for all those potentials @xmath35 and @xmath36 mev .",
    "[ gmpoten ] shows the difference between the ngbd and nmdyi single",
    " particle potentials .",
    "both those potentials produce the same bulk nuclear matter properties at equilibrium .",
    "we plot the potentials as a function of wave vector @xmath37 , for densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 @xmath38 , in units of 0.1 @xmath38 .",
    "both potentials have a somewhat similar momentum dependence , but for higher densities the ngbd is more attractive at values of @xmath39 and notably more repulsive at @xmath40 .",
    "this behaviour has been noted previously @xcite .",
    "we thus insist on the following important fact : even though the two interactions have an identical high  momentum behaviour for @xmath32 = @xmath41 , the similarity in their asymptotic values is not guaranteed for densities other than equilibrium nuclear matter density .",
    "the influence on the collective observables will be discussed in the following sections . as an additional comparison",
    ", we also show the momentum dependence of the gbd and ngbd parametrizations in fig .",
    "[ rgpoten ] .",
    "the two parametrizations yield almost identical compressibilities ( c.f .",
    "table 1 ) , but the high momentum ngbd is much more repulsive owing mainly to its asymptotic optical potential : @xmath42 . also comparing to wiringa s microscopic calculations",
    "@xcite one realizes that nmdyi is very close in behaviour to that of the uv14 + uvii interaction , over a wide range of momenta and densities . on the other hand ,",
    "the high momentum part of ngbd reaches values closer to that of the uv14 + tni potential .",
    "in addition to fitting nuclear matter properties , the potentials described by wiringa can reproduce nucleon - nucleon scattering and few  body data .",
    "one important technique proposed to quantify the flow of nuclear matter is the transverse momentum analysis  @xcite .",
    "this method has also been used to clarify the transverse momentum generating features of different nuclear mean fields in the buu approach to nucleus  nucleus dynamics . in the framework of such studies",
    "it has been shown that under certain circumstances , a soft momentum ",
    "dependent potential can produce about the same transverse momentum as that of a hard momentum independent ",

    "an effort to understand this was made in reference  @xcite . in order to further highlight the behaviour in a dynamical situation of the hard , gbd , ngbd and nmdyi potentials , we plot in fig .",

    "independent potential follows the behavior of the soft momentum ",
    "dependent one quite closely , at this impact parameter .",
    "the asymptotic values of their average transverse momentum are only 4 mev / c apart .",
    "we comment on the behaviour of the momentum  dependent interactions below .    by turning off the hard nucleon - nucleon collisions , one can study the vlasov behaviour of the hard , gbd ngbd and nmdyi potentials . from fig .",
    "4 one realizes that the momentum ",
    "dependent single particle potentials alone can generate large transverse momenta , whereas the hard potential can only yield very small transverse momenta .",
    "these results are similar to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing figs .",
    "[ nbbuu ] and [ nbvlasov ] , we can further deduce another important fact : the role of hard two - body collisions is quite different , depending on whether the nuclear mean field is momentum  dependent or not . comparing the hard and nmdyi potentials , the fraction of the net average transverse momentum generated by adding the collision term to the vlasov equation is @xmath2 100 % and @xmath2 42 % , respectively .",
    "however , it is important to point out that the transverse momentum is generated by the nuclear mean field and the hard two  body collisions in a highly non  linear fashion .",
    "[ nbvlasov ] also tells us that , even though the gbd and ngbd potentials have the same functional dependence on momentum and almost identical compressibilities , they produce net transverse momenta that are very different from each other .",
    "as discussed in section ii , this result can be understood simply in terms of the different asymptotic values of the respective one  body potentials .",
    "continuing our interpretation of the results in fig .",
    "[ nbvlasov ] , we find the following interesting fact : the ngbd and nmdyi potentials produce average transverse momenta in the vlasov mode that differ by @xmath2 10 mev / c .",
    "both these parametrizations share the same @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "as mentioned previously , fitting the static nuclear matter properties and optical potential is not enough to predict unambiguously the consequences of the different interactions in nonequilibrium situations .",
    "it is also likely that realistic cases will also carry the added complication that generally , @xmath45 in the gbd formulation of the one  body potential .",
    "[ nbpy ] shows the average in  plane transverse momentum , calculated in the buu model , as a function of centre of mass rapidity . from this figure , it is also clear that ngbd is more repulsive than nmdyi @xcite",
    ". we will discuss later which interaction we favor , from a theoretical point of view .",
    "in this section , we compare buu calculations with experimental data .",
    "we will first concentrate on values of the flow parameter @xmath0 and transverse momentum distributions , as measured in asymmetric heavy ion reactions by the diogene collaboration  @xcite and by the riverside / gsi / lbl streamer chamber group @xcite .",

    "well - known geometrical arguments are used to estimate the impact parameter @xcite .",
    "the data shows a linear rapidity dependence of @xmath47 , in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] .",
    "the flow parameter f is obtained by fitting the data to a straight line in the appropriate interval , as shown on fig .",
    "[ arpbpy45 ] .",
    "the buu calculations were performed with 120 parallel simulations to minimize numerical fluctuations , and with free space nucleon - nucleon scattering cross sections .",
    "we note in passing that since the two - body collisions contribute more to the transverse flow with a momentum  independent potential than with a momentum ",
    "dependent potential as discussed previously , this observable is not expected to be greatly sensitive to reasonable variations in the in  medium cross sections . to illustrate this point , compare also fig .",
    "[ nbbuu ] with fig .",
    "[ nbvlasov ] .",
    "our simulation results also show that the transverse momentum @xmath47depends linearly on the rapidity around @xmath47=0 with both ngbd and nmdyi potentials .",

    "the extracted values of the flow parameter , @xmath0 , are plotted as a function of the impact parameters b in fig.7 , together with the relevant data .",

    "we now turn to a set of preliminary data on symmetric systems @xcite , as measured by the eos tpc collaboration .",
    "such data are of high quality , virtually free of experimental biases .",
    "the eos time projection chamber , with its simple and seamless acceptance , good particle identification and high statistics , was designed to overcome the limitations of the previous generation of 4@xmath55 detectors . the plastic ball detector , even though having provided a seminal contribution to the field , had a complex acceptance that was not so easily simulated .",

    "we display results of calculations with a soft and a stiff momentum ",
    "dependent potential .",
    "calculations done with the nmdyi interaction reproduce the data exactly .    au + au is a reasonably large system and it might be that there exists effects that could safely be neglected for smaller nuclei at lower energies that are important here .",
    "it was brought up recently that an improvement in the angular momentum conservation in the microscopic models could perhaps lead to a re - evaluation of the role played by the nuclear mean field in generating transverse momentum in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the quantitative importance of conservation laws in microscopic models of heavy ion collisions has been investigated before @xcite . in the case at hand ,",
    "the only difference might come from the fact that we are dealing here with very heavy systems at high energies .",
    "thus the respective role played by two  body scattering and mean field effects might be modified .",
    "we have considered two numerical algorithms . in the first approach , whenever two  body scattering occurred at the microscopic level we made sure that the direction of the reaction plane was unchanged in the centre of mass of the colliding nucleons .",

    "[ gale90b ] .",
    "the imposition of exact angular momentum conservation increases the flow parameter by roughly 23% in cascade simulations .",
    "we can also see that the dominant effect in angular momentum conservation comes from keeping the direction of the reaction plane constant in individual two  body collisions . in the buu calculations ,",
    "reaction plane constraints raise the flow by only 8% . the net effect on the transverse momentum",
    "can readily by appreciated in those two figures .",
    "basically , the effect on buu calculations in considerably smaller than in cascade approaches .",

    " dependent features of the one  body self ",
    "consistent nuclear mean field , we have seen that the precise functional dependence on momentum of the interaction was important . taking two potentials with the exact same characteristics at saturation density and zero temperature ( ngbd and nmdyi )",
    ", we have shown that their behaviour in situations removed from equilibrium could be quite different . from a purely theoretical point of view",
    "we believe that approaches based on mdyi  type interactions are on a firmer basis . in gbd  like approaches , the quantity @xmath59 was put in by hand to enforce the galilean invariance of the potential .",
    "mdyi has galilean invariance from the start and furthermore , the fact that it can be identified with the fourier transform of a yukawa potential is pleasing .",
    "both interactions have the virtue of being relatively simple to handle ( mdyi is however trickier to implement numerically ) .",
    "again , in equilibrium or close to equilibrium situations it should make little difference which is used .",
    "as far as the results outlined in this paragraph go , our investigations follow in the steps of some of our previous works @xcite .",
    "furthermore , keeping in mind the quantitatively different results obtained with ngbd and nmdyi , we have confirmed the idea put forward by pan and danielewicz @xcite . by performing calculations to address data on symmetric and asymmetric systems at high energies , one can indeed assess the importance of the density  dependent and momentum  dependent terms in the nuclear equation of state , separately . in pursuing this point , we have for the first time compared diogene and eos tpc data with buu results .",
    "we find that all the data we have considered in this paper can be reproduced with a momentum ",
    "dependent interaction with a nuclear compressiblity coefficient of k = 210 mev .",
    "also , we have verified again the importance of angular momentum conservation on the generation of transverse momentum in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "relaxing the conservation law leads to a slight variation in the flow parameter in buu collisions .",
    "this change should be considered in high precision fits of the experimental data as it should undoubtedly lead to lower values of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this does not however alter the general conclusions reached in this work .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that after more than a decade of careful experimental investigations and theoretical progress , a consistent picture of the behaviour of nuclear matter at high temperatures and densitites is emerging .",
    "perhaps the crudest way of characterizing the nuclear equation of state is by its compressibilty coefficient and this value is now stabilizing to some number around 210 mev .",
    "the fact that low and high energy heavy ion experiments seem to require compatible values of k is satisfying . the fact that high quality , bias ",
    "free , exclusive experimental is now available and will continue to be generated in the immediate future will set even more stringent tests for the models .",
    "some challenging problems remain to be successfully tackled in theory .",
    "for example , the area of composite production is an active area of research @xcite . in the context of nuclear flow , this is a pressing issue as it now clear that composites bear the greatest sensitivity to collective behaviour in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
