    "let us consider magnetotactic bacteria which move in the direction of their magnetic moment @xmath2 or opposite to it due to random switching of the direction of rotation of a rotary motor .",
    "since in the synchronous regime the magnetic moment rotates synchronously with the field , so does the velocity of the bacterium .",
    "the master equation accounting for a random switching rate @xmath3 of the direction of a rotary motor rotation reads @xmath4 taking into account that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , eq . ( [ eq:1 ] ) may be rewritten for the two - dimensional case in a more simple way as follows @xmath7    there are several possible ways to analyse the properties of random trajectories of these circle swimmers .",
    "a simple approach is based on the derivation from ( [ eq:1a ] ) of a closed set of equations for several moments characterizing their distribution @xmath8 .",
    "it reads @xmath9 in order to derive a set of equations ( 3 ) the condition of normalization @xmath10 and the relation @xmath11 are used . since the set ( 3 )",
    "is closed it is possible to obtain an analytical solution for @xmath12 , which characterizes the random process of the particle diffusion .    the stationary solution for the moments @xmath13 reads @xmath14 @xmath15 relations ( [ eq:4],[eq:5 ] ) , as a result , give @xmath16 taking into account 2d character of particle motion , absence of cross - correlation @xmath17 in the stationary case and @xmath18 due to the symmetry , for the diffusion coefficient we have @xmath19 in the limit @xmath20 we have @xmath21 introducing as a characteristic time of tumbling @xmath22 relation ( [ eq:8 ] ) reads @xmath23 it coincides with the expression for the diffusion coefficient of tumbling bacterium @xcite with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is angle by which the bacterium changes direction of motion after a tumbling event . since in our case direction of the bacterium motion changes to the opposite we have @xmath24 . in the limit of high frequency for the diffusion coefficient we have @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the radius of a circular trajectory , which coincides with the expression of the diffusion coefficient in the elementary theory of brownian motion @xcite .",
    "we should remark that besides the diffusion due to random switching of the rotary motor of the bacterium there is also thermal noise due to fluctuating forces and torques .",
    "this problem is considered in @xcite . in @xcite calculation",
    "is carried out by using time - correlation functions .",
    "we will illustrate further that the diffusion coefficients of torqued swimmers may be calculated in a similar fashion as above on the basis of the fokker - planck equation for the joint distribution function of the position and orientation of the swimmer @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the operator of infinitesimal rotations and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are translational and rotational diffusion coefficients respectively . in 3d case",
    "the following closed set of equations for the moments may be obtained @xmath33 in the stationary case we have @xmath34 this gives , in agreement with @xcite , @xmath35 and @xmath36 similar to ( 14 ) relation in 2d case , up to our knowledge , was for the first time obtained in @xcite .",
    "we see that the frequency dependence of the diffusion coefficient is similar to the one for the magnetotactic bacterium under the action of the poisson like noise .",
    "the role of the switching rate @xmath3 is determined in this case by the rotary diffusion coefficient of the swimmer @xmath32 .",
    "taking for the rotational drag coefficient of the bacterium the value @xmath37 @xcite we may estimate the characteristic switching rate due to the rotational diffusion as @xmath38 , which is much less than expected due to the switching of the rotary motors of a bacterium .",
    "this shows that random trajectories observed in @xcite of bacteria in a rotating field are due to the random switching of rotary motors and not due to the random thermal noise .",
    "another evidence for this comes from direct comparison of the trajectory observed in the experiment ( see fig.11 in @xcite ) and trajectory obtained numerically as described in @xcite and shown in fig.1 .",
    "parameters used in generating the trajectory are similar to those of the experiment .",
    "trajectory length is @xmath39 , @xmath40 . from the experiment estimated radius of rotation is @xmath41 and diffusion coefficient @xmath42 which give @xmath43 and , according to ( [ eq:7 ] ) , @xmath44 .    concerning the relation ( [ eq:7 ] )",
    "we may point out that for given frequency of rotating field @xmath45 the diffusion coefficient has a maximum at definite switching rate @xmath46 .",
    "thus a bacterium , which is in unfavorable conditions and is confined to a definite area by a rotating field has a possibility to increase its diffusion coefficient for seeking more favorable conditions by adopting the switching rate of the rotary motor",
    ". it may be worth to notice that optimal switching rate given by the relation @xmath46 in the case of a rotating field with frequency @xmath47 equals to @xmath48 - a value close to the characteristic switching and tumbling events of bacteria @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to remark that similar mechanism of the enhancement of the diffusion coefficient of marine bacteria was considered in @xcite where it was illustrated that time modulation of the swimming velocity may increase the diffusion coefficient by an order of magnitude .",
    "maximum of the diffusion coefficient for the centers of spiral waves in dependence on the correlation time of random noise was found in @xcite .",
    "the set of equations ( 3 ) allows us to consider the transitory regime of establishment of the brownian diffusion .",
    "seeking the solution exponential in time @xmath49 of linear homogeneous set of equations @xmath50 we obtain @xmath51 . as a result",
    "the solution for these moments satisfying zero initial conditions reads @xmath52 and @xmath53 by integration we find the mean square displacement @xmath54 at @xmath55 for the mean square displacement we have @xmath56 at small times the motion of the bacterium is ballistic @xmath57 .",
    "in the synchronous regime tangent vector @xmath58 to the trajectory , which we choose along the magnetic moment of a bacterium , rotates with the angular velocity of the field : @xmath59 where @xmath60 . since , according to the frenet equation , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( the bacterium moves along its magnetic moment or opposite to it ) we have @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 .",
    "it means that at constant rotary motor rotation direction the trajectory is an arc of circle with radius @xmath65 .",
    "the radius vector of the curvature center of the trajectory is @xmath66 .",
    "it means that the position of the curvature center jumps by @xmath67 at the switching of the rotary motor . for numerical implementation of the algorithm it is useful to introduce complex notations @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in dimensionless form",
    "the equations for a random trajectory of the bacterium read ( @xmath70 ) @xmath71 for numerical simulation of the trajectory a set of switching times @xmath72 distributed according to the poisson law @xmath73 are introduced . at time moments @xmath74 the random variable @xmath75 equal to @xmath76 changes the sign .",
    "the generated trajectory is used to obtain diffusion coefficient @xmath31 as a function of the switching rate @xmath3 .",
    "two examples of computed mean square displacement as a function of time difference is shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is evident that the relationship is not linear at small times .",
    "slope of the best - fit line at large times is an estimate of @xmath77 . the estimated diffusion coefficient for a range of @xmath3 values is shown in fig.3 . all trajectories used consist of @xmath78 switches of swimming direction .",
    "the results are in very good agreement with ( [ eq:7 ] ) .    in @xcite , when considering sperm trajectory curvature fluctuations @xmath79 , it is found that they introduce effective diffusion coefficient given by ( @xmath80 ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a power spectrum of the curvature fluctuations , found at the circulation frequency @xmath83 . in our case of a synchronous regime of motion of bacteria in a rotating field @xmath84 is equal to the frequency of the rotating field @xmath45 .",
    "the relation ( [ eq:20 ] ) is in agreement with the numerical simulation results .",
    "taking into account that for the poisson process the probability of even number of switching events in time @xmath85 is @xmath86 and the probability of odd number of switching events is @xmath87 for the curvature time correlation function we have @xmath88 and the power spectrum of curvature fluctuations is @xmath89 relations ( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:21 ] ) give the relation ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed that according to @xcite the relation ( [ eq:21 ] ) has a more broad context than a particular example considered here and includes the noise in chemotactic signalling system and other .",
    "analysis of the random trajectories of the circle swimmers - the magnetotactic bacteria shows that experimentally observed random trajectories of bacteria are caused by the internal noise of rotary motors and are not due to the thermal fluctuations .",
    "derived on the basis of the master equation relation for the diffusion coefficient is in an excellent agreement with the results of numerical simulations and allows one to determine the characteristic rate of the random switching events of rotary motors from the available experimental data .",
