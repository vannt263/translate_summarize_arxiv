    "the breit - wigner formula describing the processes of production and decay of unstable particle is widely used in hadron and nuclear physics .",
    "the original formula @xcite , which was applied to scattering of slow neutrons , is a non - relativistic one with energy - independent parameters  resonance position and width .",
    "it is clear that the simplest breit - wigner formula is applicable only for narrow states and description of a resonance curve for broad hadron resonances ( at high experimental accuracy ) needs some improved resonance formula . in hadron phenomenology there",
    "exist slightly different methods to describe resonance contribution but practically all methods are based on ( effective ) quantum field theory .    in spite of long history we found with some astonishment that situation with description of fermion resonance is not so evident up to now .",
    "naively one can expect that the fermion resonance contribution to cross - section is the same as the boson one .",
    "such point of view may be found in many papers and reviews , in particular , in @xcite - dependent partial waves and to forget about symmetry properties @xmath0 . such way is used , in particular , in @xmath1 partial analysis @xcite . ] .",
    "but this is not the case , as it is seen from our consideration .",
    "first of all , the natural variable in fermion case is @xmath2 but not @xmath3 , so the fermion resonance factor will be @xmath4-dependent .",
    "after renormalization of dressed propagator one can see that the fermion specifics is generated by antisymmetric in @xmath4 contributions in a self - energy .",
    "this property is easily seen with use of the off - shell projection operators instead of @xmath5-matrices .",
    "below we derive the breit - wigner - like formula for fermions in quantum field theory and discuss some its properties .",
    "we found that the so obtained dressed propagator has some interesting features specific for fermions .",
    "let us first consider a more evident case of the boson resonance .",
    "the unstable particle is usually associated with the breit - wigner formula for an amplitude @xmath6 here the factor @xmath7 represents relativistic propagator of unstable particle .",
    "the similar formula may be obtained in framework of quantum field theory by means of dyson summation of the self - energy insertions into propagator .",
    "equivalently , we should solve the dyson - schwinger equation for dressed nonrenormalized propagator @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the bare and total propagators respectively , @xmath11 is the self - energy contribution ( sum of the 1pi diagrams ) .    the equation may be rewritten in terms of inverse propagators @xmath12 as a known value ( i.e.we neglect by dressing of the vertex ) , then we have so called rainbow approximation , see e.g. review @xcite .",
    "this approximation is sufficient to respect the analytical properties and unitarity and is widely used in resonance physics .",
    "sometimes this approach is not sufficient and people use some post - rainbow approximations . as an example we can remember the well known trick with introducing of the centrifugal barrier factor into width . ]",
    "@xmath13 if to use the on - mass - shell scheme of renormalization , then @xmath14 is the renormalized mass and one should subtract the self - energy contribution twice at this point @xmath15.\\ ] ] after it we have formula similar to but with `` running '' mass and width . from qft point of view",
    "the breit - wigner formula is rather rough approach , when we neglect by the energy dependence in mass and width ( i.e. by the energy dependence in loop contribution @xmath11 ) .",
    "such simplification is justified only for narrow resonance located far from threshold .",
    "dressing of the fermion propagator looks rather similar : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a self - energy contribution .    to renormalize the obtained expression it is convenient to work with the inverse propagator @xmath18 .",
    "usually the renormalization condition is formulated as the decomposition of inverse propagator in terms of @xmath19 @xmath20    useful technical step is to introduce the basis of the off - shell projection operators @xmath21 @xmath22 which simplifies all operations with @xmath5-matrices and makes more clear the renormalization procedure . for illustration ,",
    "let us use this basis for the self - energy contribution .",
    "evident chain gives : @xmath23 + \\lambda^{- } [ a(w^2)-w b(w^2)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see that coefficients @xmath24 in this basis are related by simple substitution @xmath25 and dressed propagator has this property also .",
    "the reversing of propagator is very easy due to simple multiplicative properties of the basis .",
    "if the inverse propagator has a decomposition @xmath26 with the symmetry property @xmath27 , then the propagator @xmath28 is of the form @xmath29 so , the explicit form of dressed unrenormalized propagator is evident : @xmath30 thus , using the @xmath31-basis we have separated the @xmath5-matrix structure and should renormalize the scalar coefficients dependent on @xmath4 .",
    "more exactly , we need renormalize only @xmath32 component , after that another coefficient @xmath33 is obtained by substitution @xmath0 .    for bound state , located below the threshold",
    ", the renormalization leads to the following condition for the self - energy contribution : @xmath34 one can convince yourself that the final expression , obtained by using the projection operator basis , coincides with the standard one presented in any textbook .",
    "if we deal with a resonance located higher the threshold , the renormalization condition takes the form : @xmath35 note that the real part of is some requirement on the subtraction constants of self - energy functions @xmath36 : @xmath37 whereas the imaginary part of the condition simply relates the coupling constant and width . @xmath38",
    "fixes the loop subtraction constants and after it the functions @xmath39 are defined completely .",
    "inverse propagator may be written in the form similar to breit - wigner formula but with `` running '' mass and width @xmath40 another component is obtained by the substitution @xmath0 : @xmath41 if to look at the self - energy contribution , one can see that there are the symmetric and antisymmetric contributions under the @xmath42 exchange . therefore the running mass and width also may be divided into two parts : @xmath43 and components of renormalized propagator take the form : @xmath44 let us stress that these components are normalized at different points : @xmath45    returning from projection operators to @xmath46 basis , we obtain the following formula for the resonance propagator : @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48    let us compare it with boson breit - wigner formula for the inverse propagator @xmath49 written in a similar form : @xmath50[w+(m-\\frac{i}{2}\\gamma)].\\ ] ] one can see that the fermion denominator in turns into boson one in absence of antisymmetric contributions:@xmath51 .",
    "let us compare also the interference pictures near the positive energy pole in elastic amplitude .",
    "@xmath52    for definiteness let us consider the process @xmath53 and look at the center mass helicity amplitude @xmath54 at @xmath55 @xmath56,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the nucleon c.m.s .",
    "energy .",
    "one can see that in contrast to boson case the background contribution in vicinity of @xmath58 is not expressed in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath59 .",
    "this feature is generated by @xmath60 contribution in self - energy @xmath17 . as a result instead of two parameters ( @xmath14 and @xmath59 )",
    "the fermion breit - wigner is described by four parameters ( one can use @xmath14,@xmath59 and complex background ) .",
    "all above formulae are applicable directly to spin-3/2 resonances .",
    "the dressed propagator of rarita - schwinger field has the form @xcite ( compare with ):",
    "@xmath61 where the operator @xmath62 can be found in @xcite .",
    "one can see that all above operations are repeated with the @xmath63 factor , which after all takes the form .",
    "figures [ fig1],[fig2 ] demonstrate behaviour of the running mass and width and its separation into symmetric and antisymmetric parts . for illustration we considered production of @xmath64 resonance in @xmath1 collisions with parameters resembling the @xmath65 and @xmath66 baryons , @xmath66 do not look as the isolated resonances ( see e.g. results of partial analysis @xcite ) . ] .",
    "one can see that symmetric and antisymmetric parts of running mass and width are of the same order and this is a typical situation .",
    "we would like to discuss some limit cases in dressed fermion propagator . but",
    "first of all let us look at unitarity condition and possible constrains from it .",
    "for definiteness , let us consider @xmath67 resonance production in the @xmath68 process and construct the partial waves .",
    "we use the standard @xmath69 kinematics @xcite and @xcite .",
    "effective lagrangian is of the form : @xmath70\\ ] ] corresponding partial waves : @xmath71 here @xmath57 , @xmath72 are the c.m.s . energy and momentum of nucleon respectively .",
    "effective lagrangian : @xmath73\\ ] ] partial waves : @xmath74 one can convince yourself that the partial amplitudes constructed using dressed propagator satisfy the unitarity condition ( last expressions for partial waves demonstrate it explicitly ) @xmath75 and it leads to @xmath76 so we can conclude that `` quasi - bosonic '' case @xmath51 in the dressed propagator is forbidden by unitarity requirement .",
    "the obtained field theory resonance contribution contains another interesting case , which may be called as `` anti - bosonic '' : @xmath77 . in this case",
    "both partial waves should coincide @xmath78 this relation can not be true at all energies because these partial waves have different orbital momentum and therefore should have different threshold behaviour .",
    "but `` anti - bosonic '' case can be realized as approximate equality in a resonance vicinity @xmath79 so we have degenerate resonances of different parity ( it resembles the restoration of chiral symmetry ) but this physical situation is realized in unusual manner : with using one spinor field @xmath80 . in this case",
    "both components of a dressed propagator have resonance nature @xmath81",
    "we investigated in detail the qft improved breit - wigner formula for fermions , obtained by means of the dyson summation .",
    "the final expression for dressed propagator looks rather unexpected , in particular , the resonance denominator differs from the well known boson analog .",
    "this difference arises due to presence of antisymmetric in @xmath4 contributions in self - energy .",
    "one can use the dressed fermion propagator for hadron phenomenology and in this case , after calculation of self - energy and renormalization , we have two parameters : mass and width .",
    "but if we want to obtain from some simple parametrization for @xmath82 region , we need at least four parameters , as it can be seen from the amplitude .    the essential technical ingredient of our consideration is the using the off - shell projection operators .",
    "they simplify essentially all calculations and clarify their physical meaning . recall that these projection operators were successfully used in calculations of the @xmath83-isobar propagator both in vacuum @xcite and media @xcite .                                        running mass and width and their components for resonance of positive parity.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] running mass and width and their components for resonance of positive parity.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    running mass and width and their components for resonance of negative parity.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] running mass and width and their components for resonance of negative parity.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]"
