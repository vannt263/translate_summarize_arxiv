    "the satisfiability ( sat ) problem @xcite is the prototype of np  complete combinatorial decision problems arising in theoretical computer science .",
    "such decision problems are , by definition , the most difficult problems solvable in polynomial time by some ideal non  deterministic algorithm @xcite . in practice , however , real algorithms may drastically change their performances depending on whether the instances of the problem are highly constrained or not . therefore , the worst  case classification on which complexity theory is founded does not necessarily capture the behaviour of search algorithms in specific applications .",
    "for example , random instances of np  complete decision problems undergo a dramatic change in the median time required for their solution when the instances are generated at the boundary of a critical region in the parameter space ( for an introduction to these issues , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a paradigm for such a behaviour is provided by the random k - satisfiability ( k - sat ) problem . briefly speaking , one",
    "is given @xmath3 boolean variables and a set of @xmath4 clauses to be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "a clause refers to a logical constraint on @xmath5 boolean variables , randomly chosen among the @xmath3 ones . for large instances ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "k - sat exhibits a striking threshold phenomenon as a function of the intensive ratio @xmath7 .",
    "numerical simulations show that the probability of finding an assignment of the boolean variables satisfying all clauses , falls abruptly from one down to zero when @xmath8 crosses a critical value @xmath9 of the number of clauses per variable @xcite .",
    "this scenario is rigorously established in the ( polynomial ) @xmath10 case , where @xmath11 @xcite . for @xmath12 ,",
    "much less is known ; k(@xmath13)-sat belongs to the np ",
    "complete class , roughly meaning that running times of search algorithms are thought to scale exponentially in @xmath3 when the problem instances are critically constrained .",
    "recent numerical works have provided an estimate for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a statistical mechanics approach has been attempted to get insights on the k - sat problem @xcite .",
    "these studies relie on the correspondence between solutions and ground  states of diluted spin  glass like cost  energy functions .",
    "threshold phenomena therefore correspond to zero temperature critical points in the phase diagram of the associated spin glass model .",
    "replica symmetric ( rs ) theory gives the correct value of the threshold for @xmath10 but fails in predicting the critical @xmath15 for @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this stems from the nature of the transition taking place at @xmath15 , which is continuous for @xmath10 and appears discontinuous when @xmath17 . in the latter case ,",
    "the precise location of the critical point for the first order transition would require an appropriate replica symmetry breaking scheme . for interacting models with finite connectivity ,",
    "the latter issue is still an open problem under many aspects @xcite .",
    "very recently @xcite , it has been suggested that the particular nature  continuous or discontinuous  of the phase transition taking place at the threshold could be strictly connected with the appearance of computationally hard instances , and hence to the onset of exponential regimes in search algorithms @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies on the so - called @xmath0-sat problem @xcite , that smoothly interpolates between 2-sat ( @xmath18 ) and 3-sat ( @xmath19)@xcite , have strongly supported this statement .",
    "it follows that the interest in the precise analytical localisation of discontinuous transitions in random sat models goes much beyond the purely technical aspects of the replica formalism .    in this paper",
    ", we present the analytical calculation of the tricritical point @xmath20 of the @xmath0-sat model , separating second - order phase transitions ( @xmath21 ) from first - order ones ( @xmath22 ) . in section",
    "ii , we recall the definition of the @xmath0-sat model",
    ". the main steps of the statistical physics analysis are exposed in section iii . in section iv , we study the critical region and establish the self - consistent equations fulfilled by the order parameter at threshold .",
    "we analyse these equations and show that @xmath23 . in conclusion , we underline the agreement between our result and some recent mathematical study on the @xmath0-sat model .",
    "the @xmath0-sat model is a mixed version of 2-sat and 3-sat including @xmath24 ( resp .",

    "three ) boolean variables @xcite .    to start with",

    "we first randomly choose @xmath27 among the @xmath3 possible indices @xmath28 and then , for each of them , a literal @xmath29 that is the corresponding @xmath30 or its negation @xmath31 with equal probabilities one half .",
    "a clause @xmath32 is the logical or of the @xmath27 previously chosen literals , that is @xmath32 will be true ( or satisfied ) if and only if at least one literal is true .",
    "next , we repeat this process to obtain @xmath33 independently chosen clauses @xmath34 and ask for all of them to be true at the same time , i.e. we take the logical and of the @xmath4 clauses thus obtaining a boolean expression in the so called conjunctive normal form ( cnf ) . the resulting 2cnf formula @xmath35",
    "may be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 stand for the logical and and or operations respectively .",
    "then , using the above prescription , we generate a 3cnf , hereafter called @xmath39 including @xmath25 clauses of length three .",
    "the resulting boolean formula @xmath40 that we shall analyze , reads @xmath41 . a logical assignment of the @xmath42 s satisfying all clauses , that is evaluating @xmath40 to true , is called a solution of the satisfiability problem .",
    "if no such assignment exists , @xmath40 is said to be unsatisfiable .",
    "it is worth noticing that as far as the complexity classification of the problem is concerned , for any @xmath43 any instance of the model contains a @xmath44cnf sub  formula , therefore proving that the problem itself belongs to the np ",
    "complete class .",
    "this model has a threshold behaviour as usual k  sat instances @xcite at a critical ratio @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the critical ratio is obviously bounded from above by @xmath48 , obtained from the requirement that @xmath35 has to be almost surely satisfiable .",
    "we shall show in the following that @xmath49 i.e. that the upper bound is reached when @xmath50 is smaller that a value @xmath2 lying in the range @xmath51 most remarkably , since an earlier presentation of our result@xcite , a rigorous proof of the equality ( [ satur ] ) has been derived for @xmath52 based on the analysis of the so - called unit clause algorithm @xcite .",
