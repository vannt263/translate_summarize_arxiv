    "a string - like configuration with string tension @xmath3 can be metastable with respect to either a complete breaking@xcite or a transition to a string of a lower tension @xmath4 , with @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the metastability arises through existence of an energy barrier due to the emergence in the process of two interfaces ( the ends of the original string ) each having mass @xmath6 . at zero temperature",
    "the breaking of the string proceeds due to quantum tunneling and nucleation of a critical gap in the original string with the length @xmath7 , at which length the energy gain due to the lower tension in the gap compensates for the energy @xmath8 required for the formation of the interfaces .",
    "once nucleated , the critical gap expands and converts the whole length of the original string into either a string with the lower tension , or into ` nothing ' , which formally corresponds to the limit @xmath9 .",
    "this mechanism of the string transition bears strong similarity@xcite to the decay of false vacuum@xcite and to the schwinger process@xcite of creation of pairs of charged particles by electric field .",
    "however there is an important difference between the string transition and the latter processes .",
    "namely , the transverse waves on the string correspond to a presence of massless degrees of freedom , which substantially affect the probability of nucleation of the critical gap .",
    "the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom has recently been calculated@xcite in terms of the preexponential factor in the rate of the nucleation at zero temperature of critical gaps per length of the original string in a @xmath10-dimensional theory : = _ 1-_2 2 ^d-2 ( - _ r^2 _ 1-_2 )  , [ gf ] with @xmath11 being the renormalized value of the mass of the interface that includes the effects of the transverse motion of the adjacent part of the string , and @xmath12 is the factor contributed in the rate by each of the @xmath13 transverse dimensions and given by f()= ( 2 1- ) ( 1 + 1- ) ^1 + 1- ( 1 + 1- )  ( 2 1 + 1- ) ^-1/2  .",
    "[ frho ]    in this paper we consider the thermal effect in the rate of the string transition at low temperatures .",
    "this effect further exposes the difference between the breaking of a string on one side and the false vacuum decay and the schwinger process on the other .",
    "namely , as long as the temperature @xmath14 is lower than the inverse of the critical length , @xmath15 the thermal effects in the latter processes is exponentially suppressed as @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the lowest scale for particle masses in the theory , and these effects are essentially due to the ( exponentially small ) presence of massive particles in the thermal equilibrium@xcite . in the case of a string ,",
    "however , the transverse waves on the string are massless so that their excitation has no suppression by the mass at arbitrarily low temperature .",
    "the thermal excitations of these waves create fluctuations in the distribution of energy in the string which catalyze the nucleation of the critical gap .",
    "clearly , at @xmath18 the typical wavelength of the thermal waves @xmath19 is large in comparison with the critical length @xmath20 , and the thermal effect in the rate is quite small , although not exponentially small .",
    "we find , as a result of the calculation to be presented in this paper , that the leading low temperature correction in the nucleation rate is given by the thermal catalysis factor k=\\ { 1 + ^8 450 ( _ 1-_2 3 _ 1-_2 ) ^2 ()^8 + o}^d-2  .",
    "[ kf ] we also find that as @xmath14 approaches @xmath21 the catalysis factor develops a singularity at @xmath22 . at still higher temperatures",
    "the considered here string transition behaves , in a sense , similarly to the false vacuum decay@xcite , namely the regime of the transition changes to a different tunneling trajectory , so that the temperature dependence appears in the semiclassical exponential factor in eq.([gf ] ) , rather than in the preexponential term .",
    "the material in this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate the problem in terms of periodic configurations in euclidean space - time , and in sect .",
    "3 we calculate the relevant path integrals and find the general formula for the catalysis factor in terms of expansion in powers of @xmath23 . in sect .  4",
    "we further analyze the general formula and find the first terms in the low temperature expansion of the catalysis factor , and also calculate this factor numerically for the temperatures approaching the critical point at @xmath24 .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "5 contains a summary of our results .",
    "the tunneling trajectory describing the decay of a metastable state can be found as a classical configuration , called  the bounce \" , in the euclidean space - time@xcite , and the exponential factor for the decay rate is given by the classical action on the bounce .",
    "the fields in the bounce configuration approach their values in the metastable state at the boundaries of the space - time and they approach the final state values inside the bounce .    in the discussed here problem of the string transition the bounce is found in terms of the effective low - energy nambu - goto action for the states of the string . for two strings with tensions @xmath3 and @xmath4 and a particle with mass @xmath25 propagating along the interface of the strings one can write the action in the form s= p + _ 1 a_1 + _ 2 a_2  , [ a0 ] with @xmath26 being the perimeter of the interface and @xmath27 being the corresponding string s world surface area . the approximation of the action of the system with the effective low - energy one is applicable as long as massive internal degrees of freedom of the strings are not excited .",
    "this implies in particular that the approximation is applicable only as long as the thickness of the strings can be neglected comparing to other length scales in the problem , or equivalently only as long as all the momenta in the problem are small compared to the inverse thickness of the string .",
    "if the thickness of the string is @xmath28 and the mass scale associated with it is @xmath29 then we can write the condition of applicability of the approach presented in the form lr_0 ,  km_0 [ appl_cond ] we consider initially a string with tension @xmath3 with very large length @xmath30 stretched along the @xmath31 direction . at zero temperature",
    "the stationary configurations for the action ( [ a0 ] ) are the trivial one , which is a flat world surface of the string lying in @xmath32 plane , and the bounce configuration , which has a disk filled with the lower phase of the string with the radius r=  , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "one can readily notice that the length of the critical gap is the diameter of the disk , @xmath33 .",
    "[ bounce_t_zero ]    the condition ( [ appl_cond ] ) for applicability of the effective action ( [ a0 ] ) requires that m_0 r = m_0 _ 1-_2 1  .",
    "[ rineq ]    the rate of the critical gap nucleation is then found@xcite by calculating the path integral @xmath34 around the bounce and comparing it with the path integral @xmath35 around the trivial configuration : = 1  , [ rz ] where @xmath36 is the total area of the world surface for the string .",
    "it can also be reminded that , as explained in great detail in ref.@xcite , the imaginary part of @xmath34 arises from one negative mode at the bounce configuration , and that due to two translational zero modes the numerator in eq.([rz ] ) is proportional to the total space time area @xmath37 in the @xmath32 plane occupied by the string , so that the finite quantity is the transition probability per unit time ( the rate ) and per unit length of the string .",
    "the formula in eq.([rz ] ) corresponds to a calculation of the decay rate as the imaginary part of the energy of the initial string . at a finite temperature @xmath14",
    "the corresponding relevant quantity is the imaginary part of the free energy@xcite , which one can calculate in the euclidean space by considering periodic in time configurations with the period @xmath38 . in other words",
    "the thermal calculation corresponds to the path integration in the euclidean space - time having the topology of a cylinder .",
    "the nucleation rate is then described by the same formula ( [ rz ] ) with the action and the area being calculated over one period , @xmath39 .    in the present paper",
    "we consider only sufficiently small temperatures @xmath40 , at which temperatures we find the thermal effects behaving as powers of @xmath14 , which distinguish the string process from the decay of metastable vacuum@xcite .",
    "we also treat the length @xmath30 of the metastable string as the largest length parameter in the problem , so that @xmath41 . under these conditions",
    "the bounce corresponding to the action ( [ a0 ] ) is the same as at zero temperature , except that it is placed on a cylinder rather than on a large flat plane ( fig .",
    "[ bounce ] ) .",
    "[ bounce ]    we aim at calculating the path integral over the variations of the string around the bounce configuration , which involves in particular the integration over the shifts of the string in transverse directions , i.e. those perpendicular to @xmath31 . the contribution from each of the @xmath42 transverse dimensions factorizes , so that it is sufficient to consider only one transverse dimension with further straightforward generalization to an arbitrary dimension .",
    "the coordinates on the cylinder ( or on the plane where all the points separated by @xmath43 along euclidean time are identified ) are @xmath44 , @xmath31 , with @xmath44 being the periodic time coordinate , and the coordinate orthogonal to the surface of the cylinder is @xmath45 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the configurations over which we integrate are z ( t , x= ) = 0 ,  z(t+,x)=z(t , x )  . [ boundary_conditions ] introducing the polar coordinates @xmath46 in the @xmath32-plane one can consider small variations of the classical configuration ( figs . 2 , 3 ) in the following form .",
    "variations of the interface are given by r ( ) = r + f ( )  z(r , ) =( )  , while the variations of the surfaces of the string in the bulk are @xmath47 and @xmath48 with the boundary conditions on the interface z_1(r,)= z_2(r,)= ( ) .",
    "[ boundary_zeta ] one can certainly notice that the symmetry of the polar coordinates is that of the disk describing the bounce , but it is not the symmetry of the periodicity condition in @xmath44",
    ". it will be clear from the subsequent calculation , that in fact all the discussed thermal effect can be viewed as originating from this mismatch , once it is properly accounted for .",
    "[ variation ]    in terms of the introduced variables the action ( [ a0 ] ) can be written in the quadratic approximation in the deviations from the bounce as & & s_12=_1 x + ^2 _ 1- _ 2 + _ 1-_2 2 d ( ^2+^2-f^2 ) + + & & _ 1 2 _ out r drd ( z_1^2 + ^2 r^2 ) + _ 2 2 _ in r drd ( z_2^2 + ^2 r^2 )  , [ s12 ] where the primed and dotted symbols stand for the derivatives with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspondingly , and the  out \" and  in \" integrals are taken over the surface respectively outside and inside the disk @xmath51 .    similarly , the action around a flat initial string configuration in the quadratic approximation takes the form s_1 = _ 1 x + _ 1 2 r drd ( z^2 + ^2 r^2 )  , [ s1 ] with the integral running over the whole space - time cylinder and @xmath52 parametrizing small deviations of the string in the transverse direction .",

    "for the outer solution @xmath59 however there is a difficulty due to the previously mentioned mismatch between the symmetry of the boundary and of the periodicity conditions .",
    "it is impossible to choose the solution to the laplace equation for outer string bulk variable to be @xmath64 , since it is not periodic in time . in this situation in order to have a periodic solution one can perform a periodic mapping of the cylinder on the plane and consider the outer solution of the laplace equation as the sum of the solutions produced by a  source \" at each period as illustrated in fig .",

    "therefore , the calculation of the integral is not just a calculation of the product of eigenvalues . to find the integral over the amplitudes of the fourier harmonics one has to express the amplitudes of the solutions chosen @xmath73,@xmath74 in terms of the amplitudes @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
