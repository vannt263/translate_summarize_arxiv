    "this is normally estimated by replacing expectation above by the sample mean , i.e. solving @xmath11 denoting by @xmath12 the matrix with rows @xmath3 , the solution is of course given by the principal eigenvector of the sample covariance @xmath13 , that we will denote by @xmath14 .",
    "this approach is known to be consistent in low dimension .",

    "on the other hand , it is well understood that consistency can break dramatically in the high - dimensional regime @xmath18 .",
    "this phenomenon is crisply captured by the spiked covariance model @xcite , that postulates @xmath19 where @xmath15 has unit norm , @xmath20 are i.i.d .",

    "the spectral properties of the random matrix @xmath28 defined by the [ eq : spikedmatrix ] have been studied in detail across statistics , signal processing and probability theory @xcite . in the limit @xmath29 with @xmath30 ,",

    "the principal component is asymptotically orthogonal to the signal .",
    "the failure of pca has motivated significant effort aimed at developing better estimation methods .",
    "a recurring idea is to use additional structural information about the principal eigenvector @xmath15 , such as its sparsity @xcite or its distribution ( within a bayesian framework ) @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the simplest type of structural information , namely we assume @xmath15 is known to be non - negative with @xmath34 an arbitrary , known , orthant , can be reduced to the present one . ] .",
    "it is then natural to replace the [ eq : samplepca ] problem with the following one ( whereby we use the matrix @xmath28 to represent the data ) : @xmath35 notice that this problem in non - convex and can not be solved by standard singular value decomposition .",
    "indeed it is in general np - hard by reduction from maximum independent set @xcite .",
    "two questions are therefore natural : given the additional complexity induced by the non - negativity constraint , does this constraint reduce the statistical error significantly ? are there efficient algorithms to solve the [ eq : positivepca ] problem ?    in this paper we answer _ positively _ to both questions within the spiked covariance model .",
    "namely denoting by @xmath36 the solution of the [ eq : positivepca ] problem , we provide the following contributions :    1 .",
    "we unveil a new phase transition phenomenon concerning @xmath36 that is analogous to the classical one , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pcaphasetransition ] ) .",
    "namely , for @xmath37 , @xmath38 stays bounded away from @xmath39 , while , for @xmath40 , there exists vectors @xmath15 such that @xmath41 as @xmath29 .",
    "+ non - negative pca is superior to classical pca in this respect since @xmath42 strictly .",
    "2 .   we prove an explicit formula for the asymptotic scalar product @xmath43 . non - negative pca is superior to [ eq : samplepca ] also in this respect .",
    "namely @xmath38 is strictly larger than @xmath44 with high probability as @xmath29 .",
    "+ note that the non - negativity constraint breaks the rotational invariance of classical pca ( under the spiked model ) . as a consequence , not all spikes @xmath15 are equally hard or easy to estimate .",
    "we use our theory to characterize the least favorable vectors @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   we prove that ( for any fixed @xmath45 ) a @xmath46 approximation to the non - convex optimization [ eq : positivepca ] problem can be found efficiently with high probability with respect to the noise realization .",
    "our algorithm has complexity of order @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the maximum of the complexity of multiplying a vector by @xmath28 or by @xmath49 .",
    "technically , our approach has two components .",
    "we use sudakov - fernique inequality to upper bound the expected value of the [ eq : positivepca ] optimization problem .",
    "we then define an iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem , and evaluate the value achieved by the algorithm after any number @xmath50 of iterations .",
    "this provides a sequence of lower bounds which we prove converge to the upper bound as the number of iterations increase .",
    "more precisely , we use an approximate message passing ( amp ) algorithm of the type introduced in @xcite .",
    "each iteration requires a multiplication by @xmath28 and a multiplication by @xmath49 plus some lower complexity operations .",
    "while amp is not guaranteed to solve the [ eq : positivepca ] problem for arbitrary matrices @xmath28 , we establish the following properties :    1 .   after any number of iterations @xmath50 , the algorithm produces a running estimate @xmath51 that satisfies the constraints @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "+ further the limit @xmath54 exists almost surely , and @xmath55 can be computed explicitly as a function of the empirical law of entries of @xmath15 .",
    "analogously , the asymptotic correlation @xmath56 can be computed explicitly .",

    "problem implied by sudakov - fernique inequality , we prove that @xmath58 for all @xmath59 for some dimension - independent @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that sudakov - fernique inequality is asymptotically tight in the high - dimensional limit .",
    "the asymptotic correlation converges to a limit as the number of iteration tends to infinity @xmath61 ( the convergence is , again , exponentially fast ) .",
    "further , if we add the constraint @xmath62 to the [ eq : positivepca ] optimization problem , sudakov - fernique s upper bound on the resulting value is asymptotically smaller than @xmath63 for any @xmath45 . +",
    "this implies that @xmath64 .",

    "@xmath69 is a noise matrix such that @xmath70 are independent with @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    in this case",
    "we study the analogue of the [ eq : positivepca ] problem , namely @xmath74      the non - negativity constraint on principal components arises naturally in many situations : we briefly discuss a few related areas .",
    "let us emphasize that the theoretical understanding of the methods discussed below is much more limited than for [ eq : samplepca ] .    * microarray data .",

    "lazzeroni and owen @xcite propose a model of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 indexes such gene groups ( or ` layers ' ) , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 indicate the level of participation of different samples or different genes in group @xmath79 .",
    "these authors assume @xmath82 , but it is natural to relax this condition allowing for partial participation in group @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath83 $ ] , by a change of normalization , this constraint can be simplified to @xmath84 .",
    "note a few differences with respect to our work :    * we study a model with only one non - negative component .",
    "while eq .",
    "( [ eq : plaid ] ) corresponds to a model with multiple @xmath85 components , in practice several authors fit one ` layer ' at a time , hence effectively reducing the problem to a single - component case . +",
    "extending our analysis to the multiple component case will be the object of future work .",
    "* the non - negativity constraint is imposed in the model ( [ eq : plaid ] ) on both components .",
    "this is a relatively straightforward modification of our setting .",
    "* several studies ( e.g. @xcite ) fit models of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : plaid ] ) using greedy optimization methods .",
    "their conclusions are based on the unproven belief that these methods approximately solve the optimization problem .",
    "our results ( establishing convergence , with high probability , of an iterative method ) provide some mathematical justification for this approach .",
    "* neural signal processing . *",
    "neurons activity can be recorded through thin implanted electrodes .",
    "the resulting signal is a superposition of localized effects of single neurons ( spikes ) . in order to reconstruct the single neuron activity , it is necessary to assign each spike to a specific neuron that created it , a process known as ` spike sorting ' @xcite .",
    "once spikes are aligned , the resulting data can be viewed as a matrix @xmath86 , j\\in [ p]}$ ] , where @xmath77 indexes the spikes and @xmath76 time ( or a transform domain , e.g. wavelet domain ) .    in this context , principal component analysis is often used to project each row of @xmath28 ( i.e. each recorded spike ) in a low dimensional space , or decomposing it as a sum of single neurons activity , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "clustering may be carried out after dimensionality reduction .",
    "note that each spike is a sum of single neuron activity _ with non - negative _ coefficients .",
    "in other words , the @xmath77-th row of @xmath28 reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 ,  @xmath89 are the signatures of @xmath90 neurons and @xmath91 are non - negative coefficients .    again , this corresponds to a multiple component version of the problem we study here . to the best of our knowledge , the non - negativity constraint has not been exploited in this context .",
    "* non - negative matrix factorization . *",
    "initially introduced in the context of chemometrics @xcite , non - negative matrix factorization attracted considerable interest because of its applications in computer vision and topic modeling .",
    "in particular , lee and seung @xcite demonstrated empirically that non - negative matrix factorization successfully identifies parts of images , or topics in documents corpora .",

    "note that these results only apply under a no - noise or very - weak noise conditions , but for multiple components .",
