    "the structure and chemical composition of surfaces play a fundamental role in many industrial applications . identifying and ultimately learning to control surface terminations is a key issue in modern materials design . in heterogenous catalysis @xcite chemical reactions typically take place on the solid surface of the catalyst .",
    "surfaces with different chemical compositions , for example , different surface terminations , support different chemical reactions.@xcite this is true even if the exposed surfaces possess identical crystallographic orientations .",
    "similarly , surface terminations strongly influence nucleation and growth processes .",
    "different surface terminations do , in general , favor adsorption of different atomic species@xcite and therefore affect subsequent growth of multicomponent materials .",
    "atomistic modeling@xcite is highly valuable for design of functional materials and surfaces .",
    "it serves as an important complement to and extension of experimental characterizations .",
    "it also provides predictive power and thus an opportunity to accelerate innovation.@xcite coupling dft to either thermodynamic@xcite or kinetic modeling@xcite has proven extremely useful for interpreting and complementing experimental techniques in characterization of surfaces , @xcite thin films,@xcite and interfaces.@xcite such modeling is often well - suited for descriptions of structures that are fabricated or investigated under well - controlled conditions , such as ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) or molecular beam epitaxy@xcite ( mbe )",
    ".    industrial mass production of materials often employ more efficient but less - controlled deposition methods , for example , chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) .",
    "@xcite such methods give rise to compositions and structures that need not be stable in a thermodynamical sense under ambient or ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) conditions .",
    "the fast deposition causes a lot more complexity in the growth proccess than is found in mbe .",
    "for example , it causes cluster formation and formation of intermediates in the gas phase or on the substrate and these structures define barriers for subsequent deposition events .",
    "relevant experimental characterizations of surface terminations in such cases are difficult and require in - situ measurements .",
    "atomistic , _ ab initio _ based modeling is consequently of even higher value for as - deposited structures .",
    "however , a simple scale - up of the kinetic modeling@xcite faces enormous practical problems because complex , unknown , and constantly evolving transition states determine the kinetics of the deposition .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an _ ab - initio _ thermodynamics method for deposition growth ( hereafter referred to as ait - dg ) .",
    "our method combines dft calculations with thermodynamic concepts and rate equations . the latter effectively describe supply and exhaust of gases to and from a reaction chamber as well as deposition processes inside .",
    "steady - state solutions of these rate equations enable us to determine gibbs free energies of reaction @xcite of deposition processes that lead to different surface terminations .",
    "the free energies of reaction allow us to predict surface terminations as a function of the growth environment .",
    "we emphasize that the ait - dg method is fundamentally different from the _ ab - initio _ thermodynamics method proposed in refs .   and , also adapted to interfaces,@xcite and used by many others .",
    "such methods are designed to predict terminations of surfaces that are in _ equilibrium _ with a given gas environment ( and are hereafter referred to as ait - se , _ ab - initio _ thermodynamics with surface equilibrium ) .",
    "in contrast , our ait - dg formulation possesses a non - equilibrium character , but formally contains the ait - se method in the regime , sometimes called dynamic equilibrium,@xcite where one can assume equality of the chemical potentials in the surface and in the gas .",
    "we illustrate the ait - dg method for the cvd tix(111 ) ( x = c or n ) .",
    "these belong to the simplest class of materials where different surface terminations can arise . at the same time there is a high industrial interest in these materials .",
    "tin is widely used as diffusion barrier for al - based interconnects @xcite and finds application as ohmic contact in gan semiconductor technology .",
    "@xcite tic can be used as substrate for growth of other carbidic materials such as sic or graphene,@xcite and its ( 111 ) surface also shows a potential as catalyst .",
    "@xcite moreover , tic and tin both are commonly used as tix / alumina multilayer coatings in cutting tool industry .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec1 ] focuses on the discussion of surface terminations of binary materials . in section",
    "[ sec : ait - dg ] , we present our ait - dg method in detail , exemplified for cvd of tix , and also considering the equilibrium limit of our method .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] summarizes the computational method that we use for all _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "we present our results in section  [ sec5 ] and discuss these as well as the method itself in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] contains a summary and our conclusions .",
    "figure  [ fig : surfacecomposition ] shows a schematics of thin films of a binary material ab ( deposited on a substrate ) , with the panels ab : a and ab : b differing essentially only by their surface terminations . here and in the following , ab : a ( ab : b ) denotes an ab surface with a - termination ( b - termination ) .",
    "the figure illustrates the character of our modeling where the difference in surface terminations is represented by films of different thicknesses ; formally , the left panel represents a stoichiometric film grown to @xmath0 layers , while the right panel shows a nonstoichiometric film grown to @xmath1 layers.@xcite this case represents the simplest case of surfaces that can have more than one termination , and the question arises which one will be created in a specific fabrication process .",
    "well - defined surface terminations can be created in a variety of different deposition methods , including the well - controlled mbe and less - controlled methods , such as cvd .",
    "mbe employs uhv and allows , in principle , one atom ( or dimer ) to be deposited at a time . an abrupt termination of the growth process therefore provides good explicit control over surface coverage and termination .",
    "less - controlled deposition methods typically yield much higher growth rates and are therefore more popular for large - scale manufacturing . in cvd",
    ", a substrate is exposed to an inflowing supply - gas mixture at high temperatures and at , compared to mbe , high pressures .",
    "since there is no explicit control on the number of individual atoms or molecules in the gas environment or on the surface , one can not simply end the deposition process so as to create a pre - specified surface termination .",
    "a more involved analysis is necessary to understand what termination will emerge in deposition growth .",
    "c    c +   +      tix(111 ) ( x = c or n ) are important , specific , examples where surface terminations have industrial relevance .",
    "specifically , alternating deposition of tix and al@xmath2o@xmath3  by cvd @xcite is commonly used to produce wear - resistant coatings on cemented - carbide cutting tools .",
    "@xcite    the top panel of figure [ fig : cvdschematics ] illustrates the cvd process used for tix growth .",
    "a ticl@xmath4-ch@xmath4-h@xmath2-hcl ( for tic @xcite ) or ticl@xmath4-n@xmath2-h@xmath2 ( for tin @xcite ) supply gas mixture is injected into a cvd chamber via valve 1 .",
    "the chamber is kept at a high constant temperature and at a constant pressure .",
    "the overall reactions that lead to the deposition of tix are    [ eq : cvdtix ] @xmath5    unused supply gas as well as reaction products are exhausted from the chamber via valve 2 .    in tix / alumina multilayers , the tix(111 ) surface terminations play a crucial role for the nucleation of alumina and consequently for the nature of the tix / alumina interface in the coatings .",
    "in particular , ti - terminated surfaces indicate an interface composition of the type tix : ti / o : al@xmath2o@xmath3 , whereas x - terminated surfaces favor a tix : x / al : al@xmath2o@xmath3  interface .",
    "@xcite here , ( o , al):al@xmath2o@xmath3  specifies the dominant chemical species ( o or al ) of alumina at the interface .    to the best of our knowledge , experimental studies on the tix(111 ) surface termination exist only for tic , @xcite but not for tin .",
    "they all report a ti - terminated surface .",
    "however , in all these experiments , the tic(111 ) surface was prepared by high - temperature annealing ( and associated selective evaporation ) under uhv conditions .",
    "the observed ti - termination of the tic(111 ) surface under such experimental conditions can be understood from a theoretical argument due to _ tan _ _ et al._,@xcite estimating the selective high - temperature evaporation from the total - energy cost of pulling atoms out of material .    a predictive , atomistic theory of the surface termination of as - deposited tix(111 ) as a function of the growth environment remains of central value .",
    "the characterizations and predictions are important , for example , to define a proper starting point for understanding atomistic processes in the fabrication of tix / alumina multilayer coatings . @xcite      the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cvdschematics ] shows a schematics of the kinetics leading to a surface system with an excess ti layer .",
    "the initial state is represented by a ticl@xmath4 molecule above the x - terminated tix(111 ) surface . in the final state , a ti atom ( or a layer after a number of events )",
    "is deposited .",
    "additional molecules that enter or leave the reaction and produce the final state are not shown .",
    "we also sketch the energy landscape as a function of a generic reaction coordinate .",
    "we note that only the relative energy positions of the initial and final states are shown in correspondence with the actual results of our modeling ; the nature and energy of the relevant transition states are unknown .",
    "surface morphologies obtained in mbe growth can often by understood from kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations , using dft calculations to determine process barriers.@xcite such simulations follow the surface morphology over some time by allowing for a number of events to take place at random .",
    "conceptually it is simple to generalize the kmc approach to cvd , but in practice such a generalization will be extremely challenging .",
    "the chemical species supplied in cvd are usually more complex than single atoms or dimers used in mbe .",
    "worse , the reactants will not , in general , simply dissociate on the surface but enter into complicated reactions with other species and form clusters .",
    "these reactions are not limited to the surface and may lead to a large variety of intermediates . while adaptive intelligent kmc exists and is being developed,@xcite the complexity in cvd is enormous .    at the same time , the high deposition temperature in cvd motivates a shift away from explicit kinetic modeling .",
    "we therefore develop a thermodynamic description that focuses entirely on initial and final states , retaining the simplicity of the analysis for selective evaporation in uhv .",
    "@xcite a nonequilibrium thermodynamic description becomes applicable when high temperature facilitates structural reorganization and permits the growing system to reach and sample the set of possible final states .",
    "figure [ fig : hnuc ] illustrates possible processes that lead to deposition of single ti and c layers for tic .",
    "we determine a preference for the surface termination by comparison of the gibbs free energy of reaction for such excess - layer structures with those of the stoichiometric tix .",
    "the reactions listed in ( [ eq : cvdtix ] ) only describe deposition that leads to tix with the full stoichiometry of the bulk .",
    "we supplement that description by a thermodynamic characterization of dominant reaction pathways leading to formation of excess layers for both tic and tin systems .    for excess - layer reactions ,",
    "we consider the following reactions for ti deposition on tic and tin ,    [ eq : excessti ] @xmath6    here , tic : c / ti ( tin : n / ti ) identifies a system with an additional ti layer on the c - terminated tic ( n - terminated tin ) surface .",
    "additional x layers may be deposited as    [ eq : excessx ] @xmath7    since deposition of ti is relevant only on an x - terminated surface and deposition of x only on the ti - terminated surface we suppress the specification of the original surface termination in the following . for example , tic / ti will be used instead of tic : c / ti .",
    "c    our thermodynamic method to predict terminations of growing surfaces describes phenomena that lie between the static equilibrium limit and the non - equilibrium limit that requires a fully kinetic theory .",
    "we assume an experimental setup similar to that illustrated in the top panel of figure  [ fig : cvdschematics ] .",
    "we use the difference in gibbs free energies of reaction @xmath8 as a predictor for the prevalence of growing either an a - terminated ( @xmath9 ) or a b - terminated ( @xmath10 ) surface of a binary material ab . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the free energy of reaction associated with the formation of an excess a ( b ) layer .",
    "our choice of predictor follows naturally from an analogy with chemical reaction theory,@xcite and from considering surface transformations .",
    "the following coupled set of reactions change an a- ( b- ) terminated ab surface into a b- ( a- ) terminated surface ,    @xmath12    [ eq : reactions ]    the probability for growing either an a- or b - terminated surface is described by rate equations where the rates @xmath13 depend on the deposition environment ( reactants @xmath14 and products @xmath15 ) .",
    "the steady - state solution @xmath16 is closely approximeted by @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the inverse temperature .",
    "this evaluation ( [ evaluation ] ) becomes exact in the limit of dynamic equilibrium ( identified by @xmath19 ) where @xmath20 reduces to a difference in surface free energies .",
    "further details on the nature of the strategy and the applicability to nonequilibrium conditions are given in the appendix .",
    "the assumptions that facilitate the evaluation of free energies of reaction are :    1 .   the system composed of the growing surface and the gas environment settles into a steady state , specified by the gas supply , deposition , and gas exhaust rates .",
    "we do not _ a priory _ assume that the gases and the surface are in mutual equilibrium , nor do we generally expect such an equilibrium to emerge .",
    "each of the gases that take part in reactions is fully thermalized at the steady - state partial pressure so that we can associate a chemical potential to them .",
    "3 .   the overall pressure is low enough so that a description of all gases in terms of the ideal - gas approximation applies .",
    "4 .   the temperature of the system is high enough so that we can neglect kinetic barriers .",
    "the computational strategy and the first assumption of a steady state is a novel feature of our method .",
    "we derive the steady state from a rate equation that describes the supply and exhaust of gases into and from the reaction chamber as well as the deposition inside the chamber .",
    "the other three assumptions are identical to those of the ait - se method .",
    "the ait - se describes a system in a static equilibrium at high temperatures .",
    "the ait - se might also describe systems in _",
    "dynamic equilibrium_. dynamic equilibrium@xcite here means that the free energy of reaction ( derived and calculated below ) exactly equals zero .",
    "this condition also applies in static equilibrium but in dynamic equilibrium the zero - value of the free energy of reaction arises from the steady - state concentrations of reactants and reaction products .",
    "a ( virtual ) drop in the reaction rate readily leads to a drop of the concentrations of reaction products but not of the reactants ( due to the supply and exhaust ) , so that the dynamics of the reaction is restored .",
    "we find that as the steady state approaches dynamic equilibrium , the predictions of ait - dg coincide with those of the ait - se .",
    "however , even if dynamic equilibrium is reached , our description in terms of a rate equation will be necessary in order to determine chemical potentials of the gas - phase constituents from their individual pressures during the process .",
    "we also emphasize that , during growth , the steady state does not necessarily settle into a state of dynamic equilibrium .",
    "figure [ fig : hnuc ] illustrates the formation of ti and c excess layers on tic(111 ) , corresponding to the reactions in ( [ eq : tic / ti ] ) and ( [ eq : tic / c ] ) .",
    "similarly , we assume that ti and n excess layers can be deposited on tin(111 ) according to the reactions in ( [ eq : tin / ti ] ) and ( [ eq : tin / n ] ) .",
    "we represent the tix(111 ) surface before deposition of additional layers by a stoichiometric slab . upon deposition of an additional layer",
    "the slab becomes non - stoichiometric , which motivates the terminology of an excess layer .",
    "a stoichiometric tix(111 ) slab is asymmetric along the [ 111 ] direction . in particular , it possesses one ti - terminated surface and one x - terminated surface .",
    "an excess ti layer is deposited on the x - terminated side of the slab , while an excess x layer is be deposited on the ti - terminated side .",
    "we introduce the chemical potentials @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for ti , c , and n atoms in the gases . the set of @xmath24 can be conveniently related to differences between several molecular chemical potentials ( see below ) .",
    "the chemical potentials of ti , c , and n in the gases do not in general equal the respective chemical potentials @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in the solid bulk . for the latter",
    "the free energy per bulk unit,@xcite @xmath28 , always specifies material stability , @xmath29 growth of tix , on the other hand , is characterized by @xmath30 the free energy of reaction@xcite for the deposition of one unit of bulk is defined as @xmath31    we also introduce the free energy of reaction @xmath32 which corresponds to the gain in energy per surface unit in the deposition of one excess layer . for deposition of excess ti ,",

    "requires simple approximations to evaluate free energies of surface systems and chemical potentials of gas - phase species .",
    "we base these approximations on experimentally available thermochemical data .    for the gases , we employ the ideal gas approximation .",
    "this approximation in justified for low pressures which is typically the case in cvd of tix .",
    "it also allows us to express the @xmath42 in terms of temperature @xmath43 and partial pressure @xmath44 , @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the dft total energy of the gas phase species ( molecule ) , and @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "however , the effect of neglecting these factors is expected to be small.@xcite      evaluation of the gas - phase chemical potentials ( [ eq : mu ] ) requires the specification of the deposition temperature and the individual partial pressures .",
    "the temperature and the total pressure inside the cvd chamber can be controlled reasonably well during fabrication .",

    "conversely , a decrease of the n@xmath2 concentration in the supply gas ( balanced by h@xmath2 ) and a simultaneous increase of the deposition temperature , to @xmath129c results into the favorization of a ti - terminated surface .",
    "_ in summary _",
    ", we find that , under the conditions specified in ref .",
    ", the as - deposited tic(111 ) surface will be ti terminated . forcing a c - terminated surface by variation of process parameters within the specified supply gas can not be achieved . under the conditions specified in ref .  , the tin(111 )",
    "surface can , in principle , be either ti- or n - terminated , depending on the ratio @xmath81 between the deposition and supply rate . by introducing a slight amount of hcl into the supply gas , a n - terminated surface will be forced . with another choice of deposition parameters",
    "a ti - terminated surface will evolve .",
    "the ait - dg method that we have proposed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ait - dg ] and illustrated in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] is designed to describe surface terminations as a function of the growth environment .",
    "our predictions are based on calculations of the free energies of reaction @xmath32 .",
    "we motivate this criterion by the physical principle that all systems strive for the states of low energy , given relevant boundary conditions .",
    "the method applies in dynamic equilibrium but also in scenarios where ( dynamic ) equilibrium is not maintained but the system still settles into a steady state .",
    "the method assumes that kinetic effects do not lock the system into thermodynamically unstable morphologies .",
    "it assumes in essence that a high deposition temperature causes a continuous annealing of the emerging structure .",
    "kinetic - barrier effects certainly exist and may prevent some systems from actually reaching the structure and morphology with the lowest thermodynamic energy .",
    "@xcite similar to the ait - se method , our method neglects these barrier effects . in principle",
    ", this approximation limits the applicability of our method to high - temperature growth where barriers become less important .",
    "nevertheless , kinetic effects can not be expected to alter the predictions in cases similar to tic .",
    "this is because one of the free energies of reaction is negative ( ti excess ) while the other is positive ( c excess ) .",
    "another obvious limitation is that of the ideal - gas approximation from which we infer the temperature and pressure dependence of the molecular chemical potentials .",
    "formally this approximation limits our description to low - pressure scenarios , but the approach could easily be generalized by a more refined description of the gas thermodynamics .",
    "our method is capable of describing surface terminations as they evolve during a growth process .",
    "this is fundamentally different from predicting the termination of a surface that is in equilibrium with the environment .",
    "as illustrated for tin in the top panel of figure [ fig : hnuccvdtin ] , the emerging surface termination depends on the the scaled reaction rate , @xmath75 . in such cases ,",
    "our method should have clear advantages over the ait - se method .",
    "use of our method requires only that measurements of the scaled reaction rate are made available.@xcite    we are dealing with an open system that has both a gas flow and a consumption of gases during deposition . in a closed system , where the number of gas - phase species is fixed",
    ", the surface - gas system will approach equilibrium ( unless there are important kinetic barriers).@xcite similarily , the growing surface and the gas environment could be in a state of dynamic equilibrium . in this case , the analysis in sec .  [",
    "sec : equilibriumlimit ] shows how the ait - se formalism could be extended to cover a description of the deposition .",
    "this can even work for materials that do not contain constituents a for which there exist molecular counterparts a@xmath130.@xcite using the free surface energy as equilibrium predictor , the chemical potentials of atoms in the gas can be associated as an appropriate difference between molecular chemical potentials .",
    "an explicit example for tic in an ch@xmath4-ticl@xmath4-h@xmath2 environment is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muaig ] ) .",
    "however , since the chemical potentials of atoms now depend on partial pressures of several gas - phase species , there is still a need to determine all relevant partial pressures .",
    "the rate - equation approach presented here supplies the information that is necessary for application of either the ait - se or the more general ait - dg description of deposition growth.@xcite    we emphasize that growing systems , in general , do not need to reach dynamic equilibrium , but may be in any other steady state ( if steady - state is reached at all ) .",
    "if dynamic equilibrium was always maintained , the scaled reaction rate @xmath76 would always assume its critical value , that is , a maximum .",
    "the absolute deposition rate could then be increased to arbitrarily large values , simply by increasing the supply rate at a fixed total pressure .",
    "we believe that the assumption of dynamic equilibrium is too optimistic for cvd systems , and we would not generally trust dynamic - equilibrium descriptions .",
    "the here - proposed theory of deposition growth ( ait - dg ) applies also when the deposition and supply rates are independent variables .      using the free energy of reaction for the formation of excess layers on a specified surface we have shown for tix(111 ) how surface terminations can be understood from knowledge of the details of the cvd gas supply . for tin",
    ", we have also illustrated that the method can be used to guide the growth towards a desired surface composition .",
    "that is , we have shown that we can modify the deposition environment ( supply gas composition , deposition temperature , and deposition pressure ) to allow either of the two surface terminations to emerge",
    ".    from this point of view our suggested method has a potential for accelerating innovation.@xcite in the case of tix(111 ) , the potential to design the surface termination may seem trivial .",
    "the change from a ti- to a n - terminated tin(111 ) surface that follows from raising the hcl concentration in the supply gas could likely also be obtained by , terminating the deposition process with an replacement of the ticl@xmath4-n@xmath2-h@xmath2 supply gas with a pure n@xmath2 supply gas .",
    "we argue , however , that our method is valuable for characterizing more complex materials with a larger variety of possible surface terminations .",
    "this is particularly true when we extend the application to understand binding at interfaces that arise in deposition growth,@xcite for example , in the case of thin - film alumina on tic.@xcite",
    "we present a method based on _ ab - initio _ calculations supported by thermochemical data to predict terminations of surfaces as they emerge during high - temperature deposition growth from a multicomponent gas , for example chemical vapor deposition .",
    "the method describes scenarios that are located between a static equilibrium and the fully non - equilibrium regime that requires a complete kinetic description .",
    "it relies on the basic thermodynamical principle that all systems strive for low - energy states subject to statistics and other boundary conditions .",
    "rate equations and associated steady - state solutions play a central role in the calculation of free energies of reaction .",
    "we use the latter to determine the chemical composition of the outermost surface layer of the growing surface .",
    "we illustrate the approach for tix(111 ) ( x = c or n ) . for tic , we predict a ti - terminated surface when fabricated under the conditions stated in ref .  .",
    "for tin , our predictions based on experimental conditions reported in ref .   are not so clear .",
    "we find that the termination depends on the ratio between the reaction rate and the rate at which the gas is supplied to the reaction chamber.@xcite in or close to dynamic equilibrium , we predict a n - terminated tin surface .",
    "departing from dynamic equilibrium will result in a ti - terminated surface .",
    "we also suggest deposition parameters for which ti- or n - terminated surfaces can be achieved independent of reaction and supply rates .",
    "we also compare our method with the ait - se method.@xcite we show that the predictions of our method agree with those of the ait - se method in the limit where ( dynamic ) equilibrium is maintained , but also point out that this condition is not necessarily applicable to growth . in a closed system ( absence a gas flow )",
    ", there is an affinity to reach equilibrium . in an open system ( with the gas flow turned on ) , one could expect a corresponding affinity to reach dynamic equilibrium .",
    "however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , this expectation is likely too optimistic for general cvd growth conditions . in such cases ,",
    "our method has clear advantages since it does not _ a priori _ implement equilibrium constraints .",
    "the choice of materials , in particular tic , also exemplifies the broader applicability of our method as compared to a strict implementation of the ait - se method.@xcite our method is not formally limited to predictions of oxide surface stability ( or as in extensions of ait - se , to a@xmath131b@xmath130 compound surfaces for which there is an a@xmath132 or b@xmath132 counterpart in the gas phase ) .",
    "finally the capability of predicting different surface terminations as a function of the deposition conditions illustrate the predictive power of our method .",
    "it motivates continued development of _ ab - initio _ thermodynamics , also in a role to guide experimental optimization of surface and interfacial structures .",
