    "in this paper we consider a class of 1/2 bps states that arises very naturally in the study of the ads / cft correspondence for maximally supersymmetric theories .",
    "these states are associated to chiral primary operators with conformal weight @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a particular @xmath5 charge in the r - symmetry group . for small excitation energies",
    "@xmath6 these bps states correspond to particular gravity modes propagating in the bulk @xcite .",
    "as one increases the excitation energy so that @xmath7 one finds that some of the states can be described as branes in the internal sphere @xcite or as branes in ads @xcite . these were called  giant gravitons \" .",
    "as we increase the excitation energy to @xmath8 we expect to find new geometries .",
    "the bps states in question have a simple field theory description in terms of free fermions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in a semiclassical limit",
    "we can characterize these states by giving the regions , or ",
    "droplets \" , in phase space occupied by the fermions .",
    "we can also picture the bps states as fermions in a magnetic field on the lowest landau level ( quantum hall problem ) . in this paper",
    "we study the geometries corresponding to these configurations .",
    "these are smooth geometries that preserve 16 of the original 32 supersymmetries .",
    "we are able to give the general form of the solution in terms of an equation whose boundary conditions are specified on a particular plane .",
    "we can have two types of boundary conditions corresponding to either of two different spheres shrinking on this plane in an smooth fashion .",
    "this plane , and the corresponding regions are in direct correspondence with the regions in phase space that were discussed above . once the occupied regions are given on this plane , the solution is determined uniquely and the ten ( or eleven ) dimensional geometry is non - singular and does not contain horizons .",
    "= 4.0 in    the topology of the solutions is fixed by the topology of the droplets on the plane .",
    "the actual geometry depends on the shape of the droplets .",
    "in fact , this characterization is reminiscent of toric geometry . in the type iib case",
    "we simply need to solve a laplace equation .",
    "a circular droplet gives rise to the @xmath9 solution , see figure [ droplets ] .",
    "small ripples on the droplet correspond to small fluctuations corresponding to gravitons in @xmath10 . a small droplet far away from the circular one corresponds to a group of d3 branes wrapping an @xmath11 in @xmath1",
    ". a hole inside the circle corresponds to branes wrapping an @xmath11 in @xmath12 . in the limit that the droplets become small these solutions reduce to the giant graviton branes that were discussed extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "some of our solutions smoothly interpolate between branes wrapping the sphere and branes wrapping ads .",
    "we can also have solutions that correspond to new geometries which can not be thought of as branes .",
    "in other words , when we put many branes together they back - react on the geometry and we get new geometries with new topologies that are determined by geometric transitions .",
    "the transition is that the sphere the branes are wrapping becomes contractible while the transverse sphere becomes non - contractible and the branes get replaced by flux .    from the geometrical point of view we can consider this class of bps geometries and we can wonder how we quantize them",
    "of course , the exact description in terms of fermions is telling us how to do it . in the type iib case ,",
    "a two dimensional plane contained in the ten dimensional geometry can be identified as the phase space of free fermions .",
    "the quantization of the area in the phase space amounts to the quantization of fluxes in the geometry .",
    "one interesting lesson is that geometries with very small topologically non - trivial fluctuations , or spacetime - foam , are already included when we perform the usual quantization of ordinary long wavelength gravitons .",
    "these solutions are also interesting because they provide a relationship between free fermions and string theory which is rather different than the one we get from the @xmath13 matrix model ( for reviews see @xcite ) . here",
    "the free fermions arise as the bps sector of a ten dimensional string theory .",
    "perhaps we should not be surprised because integrable systems often lead to free fermions and a bps system is in some sense integrable , so it is natural to have a free fermion description",
    ". it would be nice to understand better whether there is a reduction of the usual superstring in ads @xcite to a string theory describing just this 1/2 bps sector .",
    "we can also describe 1/2 bps excitations of the plane wave geometry , which corresponds to a half filled plane . in this case",
    "the fermion becomes a relativistic dirac fermion in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the light - cone energy of the solution is the same as the usual energy for a dirac fermion .",
    "particle - hole duality corresponds to exchanging the 3-sphere in the first four of the eight transverse coordinates with a 3-sphere in the last four coordinates .    by performing dualities",
    "we can get solutions which are dual to the mass deformed m2 brane theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is rather similar to the mass deformed @xmath14 yang - mills theory , or @xmath15 theory , analyzed by polchinski and strassler @xcite .",
    "the mass term preserves @xmath16 symmetry in @xmath17 and the theory has vacua that contain m5 branes wrapping an @xmath11 in the first four coordinates or an @xmath11 in the last four coordinates .",
    "our solutions are non - singular and describe all possible vacua of this theory . by changing the fluxes on the various spheres",
    ", we can smoothly interpolate between the solutions with the m5 branes wrapping the first @xmath11 and the solutions with those wrapping the second @xmath11 .",
    "this system has also been recently analyzed in @xcite , in terms of slightly different variables .",
    "our approach leads to a simple way of constructing _ non - singular _ geometries .",
    "we have also performed a similar analysis for the m - theory case , which corresponds to giant gravitons in @xmath18 or @xmath19 . in this case",
    "we have similar droplets , and the 11 dimensional geometry is obtained after solving a three dimensional toda equation . in this case",
    "we could only solve the equations explicitly in very simple examples .",
    "we also consider the m - theory plane wave . in this way we could find geometries that are dual to the bmn matrix model @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find more evidence that the m5 brane emerges as a state of the bmn matrix model @xcite .    by performing a wick rotation of the above analysis",
    "we are led to a characterization of all m - theory compactifications to @xmath1 that preserve @xmath20 four dimensional supersymmetry .",
    "these are again given by solutions of the toda equation but with slightly different boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , we fit the previously known solutions @xcite into this class .",
    "this constitutes an extension of the analysis in @xcite which characterized m - theory compactifications to @xmath1 preserving @xmath21 four dimensional supersymmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the geometries associated to 1/2 bps states in @xmath22 or the type iib pp - wave . in section 3",
    "we discuss the 1/2 bps geometries describing states in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , or m theory pp - wave . in various appendices",
    "we give more technical details .",
    "we consider @xmath25 super yang mills on @xmath26 .",
    "we are interested in the class of states that preserves one half of the supersymmetries .",
    "these are the states associated to chiral primary operators that are built by taking products of traces of powers of a single chiral scalar field of @xmath27 yang mills . denoting by @xmath28 the six scalars",
    ", we are interested in the field @xmath29 , and the operators @xmath30 . these bps states can be described in a variety of ways .",
    "the one that will be most useful for our purposes will be the description in terms of free fermions discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these free fermions arise in the following way .",
    "we are interested in states with @xmath31 .",
    "the only such state is the lowest kaluza - klein mode of the field @xmath32 on the @xmath11 .",
    "this mode has a harmonic oscillator potential which arises from its conformal coupling to the curvature of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "so we are interested in the gauge invariant states of a matrix @xmath32 in a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "standard arguments for matrix quantum mechanics @xcite imply that the system reduces to @xmath33 fermions in a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "we can think of these fermions as forming droplets in phase space .",
    "the ground state corresponds to a circular droplet .",
    "equivalently , we can say that we have a quantum hall fluid .",
    "we can form the new hamiltonian @xmath34 , where @xmath4 is the angular momentum in the 12 plane . in terms of this new hamiltonian",
    "we have a landau level problem .",
    "the 1/2 bps states are the ground states of @xmath35 and correspond to the lowest landau level .",
    "the ads ground state corresponds to a circular droplet .",
    "the conformal dimension @xmath36 of any excitation is given by the angular momentum on the hall plane , or the energy of the harmonic oscillator , above the ground state corresponding to the circular droplet .",
    "it is also interesting to take the plane wave limit of these configurations . in terms of the droplets",
    "this amounts to zooming in on the edge of a droplet , as shown in figure [ pplimit ] .",
    "so the plane wave can be thought of as a hall configuration where we fill the lower half plane ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "bps excitations correspond to particles and/or hole excitations .",
    "these look like the states of a relativistic fermion .",
    "in fact , the lightcone energy of the states , @xmath38 , is indeed given by the expression of the energy for a relativistic fermion .",
    "these bps states preserve 16 non - trivial supersymmetries as well as @xmath39 bosonic symmetries , where @xmath40 corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "this generator commutes with the preserved supercharges .",
    "we now look for the most general type iib geometry that is invariant under @xmath42 .",
    "this implies that the geometry will contain two three - spheres and a killing vector .",
    "we only expect the five  form field strength to be excited .",
    "so we assume we have a geometry of the form",
    "ds^2&=&g_dx^dx^+e^h+gd_3 ^ 2+e^h - gd_3 ^ 2 + f_(5)&=&f_dx^dx^d_3 + f_dx^dx^d_3 fiveform where @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the dilaton and axion are constant and that the three - form field strengths are zero .",
    "the self duality condition on the five - form field strength implies that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are dual to each other in four dimensions : [ fequation ] f = e^3 g * _ 4 f  ,   f = d b ,   f = d b we now demand that this geometry preserves the killing spinor , i.e. we require that there are solutions to the equations _ m+^m_1m_2m_3m_4m_5 f^(5)_m_1m_2m_3m_4m_5_m = 0 this equation is analyzed using techniques similar to the ones developed in @xcite .",
    "one first writes the ten dimensional spinor as a product of four dimensional spinors and spinors on the spheres . due to the spherical symmetry",
    "the problem reduces to a four dimensional problem involving a four dimensional spinor .",
    "one then constructs various forms by using spinor bilinears .",
    "these forms have interesting properties .",
    "for example , we can construct a killing vector , which we assume to be non - zero .",
    "this is the translation generator , @xmath46 .",
    "there is another interesting form which is a closed one form .",
    "this can be used to define a local coordinate @xmath47 .",
    "this coordinate @xmath47 is rather special since one can show that @xmath47 is the product of the radii of the two @xmath11s . by analyzing the killing spinor equations one can relate the various functions appearing in the metric to a single function",
    "this function ends up obeying a simple differential equation .",
    "we present the details of this analysis in appendix a. the end result is : ds^2 & = & - h^-2 ( dt + v_i dx^i)^2 + h^2 ( dy^2 + dx^idx^i ) + y e^g d_3 ^ 2 + y e^ - g d _ 3 ^ 2 solmetric + h^-2 & = & 2 y g , solmetric2 + y _ y v_i & = & _ ij _ j z , y ( _ i v_j-_j v_i ) = _ ij _ y z solmetric3 + z & = & 1 2 g solmetric4 + f & = & db_t ( dt + v ) + b_t dv + d b  ,   + f & = & db_t ( dt + v ) + b_t dv + d 4dgf2 + b_t & = & - 14 y^2 e^2 g ,  b_t = - 1 4 y^2 e^- 2 g + d b & = & - 1 4 y^3 * _ 3 d ( z + y^2 )  ,   d = - 1 4",
    "y^3 * _ 3 d ( z - y^2 )   4dgf where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the flat space epsilon symbol in the three dimensions parameterized by @xmath50 .",
    "we see that the full solution is determined in terms of a single function @xmath51 .",
    "this function obeys the linear equation _",
    "i z + y _ y ( _ y z y ) = 0 [ zequation ] since the product of the radii of the two 3-spheres is @xmath47 , we would have singularities at @xmath52 unless @xmath51 has a special behavior .",
    "it turns out that the solution is non - singular as long as @xmath53 on the @xmath52 plane spanned by @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath55 at @xmath52 .",
    "then we see that @xmath51 will have an expansion @xmath56 , where @xmath57 will be positive with our boundary conditions . from this",
    "we find that @xmath58 .",
    "so we see that the metric in the @xmath47 direction and the second 3-sphere directions becomes h^2 dy^2 + y e^- g d_3 ^ 2 ~ c(x ) ( dy^2 + y^2 d_3 ^ 2 ) in addition we see that @xmath59 remains finite and the radius of the first sphere also remains finite .",
    "one can also show that @xmath60 remains finite by using the explicit expression we write below . when @xmath61 the discussion is similar .",
    "in fact the transformation @xmath62 and an exchange of the two three  spheres is a symmetry of the equations .",
    "this corresponds to a particle hole transformation in the fermion system .",
    "this will not be a symmetry of the solutions if the fermion configuration itself is not particle - hole symmetric , or the asymptotic boundary conditions are not particle - hole symmetric ( as in the @xmath22 case ) .",
    "we will explain below that the solution is non - singular at the boundary of the two regions .",
    "so in order to determine the solution we need to specify regions in the @xmath54 plane where @xmath63 .",
    "these two signs corresponds to the fermions and the holes , and the @xmath54 plane corresponds to the phase space . after defining @xmath64",
    "the equation ( [ zequation ] ) becomes the laplace equation in six dimensions for @xmath65 with spherical symmetry in four of the dimensions , @xmath47 is then the radial variable in these four dimensions .",
    "the boundary values of @xmath51 on the @xmath52 plane are charge sources for this equation in six dimensions .",
    "it is then straightforward to write the general solution once we specify the boundary values .",

    "@xmath70 is the unit normal vector to the droplet pointing towards the @xmath71 regions , @xmath72 is a contribution from infinity which arises in the case that @xmath51 is constant outside a circle of very large radius ( asymptotically @xmath22 geometries ) .",
    "@xmath73 when we have @xmath74 asymptotically .",
    "the contour integral in ( [ vexpres ] ) is oriented in such a way that the @xmath75 region is to the left .",
    "we see from the second expression for @xmath60 in ( [ vexpres ] ) that @xmath60 is finite as @xmath76 in the interior of a droplet .",
    "we also see from ( [ vexpres ] ) that @xmath60 is a globally well defined vector field .",
    "coordinate is compact , there are no compact two cycles in the @xmath77 space .",
    "so we do not have any compact two cycles on which we could find a non - zero integral of @xmath78 .",

    "in fact , this computation shows that , in general , the boundary between two regions is smooth .",
    "the reason is that locally the boundary between two regions looks like the plane wave and therefore we will get a non - singular metric .",

    ", we can reduce the equations @xmath542 to a single relation = 0 we also notice that since @xmath79 is a killing direction , we can choose the time dependence of @xmath445 to be ~e^iet/2 to write the remaining equations it is convenient to choose a particular basis of gamma matrices : ^r = e^r_r_3,^t = ie^t_t_2 and decompose a spinor @xmath445 in this basis as =(      ) with this decomposition we arrive at the system of equations : [ spineqnone ] & & _ + + ie^-12 + 3kr^-3_r h_-=0 + & & _ -+ ie^-12 + 3kr^-3_r h_+=0 + [ spineqntwo ] & & _ + -2im e^t_t a_t_-=0 + & & _ 2im e^t_t a_t_+=0 + [ spineqnthree ] & & _ + -se^-k_-=0 + & & _ - -se^-k_+=0 + & & _ + +",
    "_ -=0 + [ spineqnfour ] & & _ -+ _ + = 0 + we have written all nontrivial equations except @xmath547 .",
    "the reason for separating this equation is that unlike ( [ spineqnone])([spineqnfour ] ) , it is not algebraic in @xmath445 , but rather gives a differential equation which involves @xmath548 .",
    "so the simplest way to proceed is to solve the equations ( [ spineqnone])([spineqnfour ] ) first and to find a bosonic background , and then use the equation @xmath547 to determine the radial dependence of @xmath445 .",
    "since we are not interested in constructing @xmath549 we will not need the equation @xmath547 for the moment .",
    "notice that due to our gauge condition , we have e^r_r = r^-3e^n+3k , so derivative @xmath550 always appear in the combination r^-3_r=_r , r to find the solution of the system ( [ spineqnone])([spineqnfour ] ) , we observe that the general systems of the form : & ( a+b)_++c_-=0 , & ( d+e)_++(f+g)_-=0 + & ( a - b)_-+c_+=0 , & ( d - e)_-+(f - g)_+=0 implies that cd = af+bg , ce = ag+bf , a^2=b^2+c^2,d^2-e^2=f^2-g^2 by applying these formulas to various pairs from the system ( [ spineqnone])([spineqnfour ] ) we will find equations which do not contain @xmath445 .",
    "for example , integrability condition for ( [ spineqnone ] ) and ( [ spineqntwo ] ) leads to an equation -10 m e^-6+n+3k - nh_r =- me^-6 + 3k_r h which can be easily integrated : e^=()^1/10 now we combine ( [ spineqntwo ] ) and ( [ spineqnthree ] ) : e^4 + 4k_r(k+)=h_0 ^ -1e^4 + 4k = h_0 ^ -1 ( r^4+c_1 ) where @xmath551 is an integration constant . to find @xmath552 we take a determinant of ( [ spineqnthree ] ) : e^2n[_r e^4k+4]^2=e^2k - s^2e^8 . and rewrite it as an expression for @xmath553 : e^2n =- h_0 ^ 2[m^2 e^2k-4 s^2 e^8]= h_0 ^ 2[m^2 e^2k+4e^8 ] finally we take a determinant of ( [ spineqnone ] ) to find an expression for @xmath554 : 2=h_0_r[(r+ ) h^-1 ] let us summarize the results we have so far : [ solutone ] hh_0 h^-1,e^=h^-,e^k=(r^4+c_1)^1/4h^(2h_0)^-1/4,e^2n=(2h_0)^2 fh^-4/5 where we defined [ deffunc ] f=1+e^2k-8=1+h ( r^4+c_1)^1/2 substituting these expressions into the equations ( [ spineqnone])([spineqnfour ] ) and writing all possible integrability conditions , we find only two nontrivial equations : [ nontriveqn ] & & 2fr^1/2 ^ 2_r(rh)=- ( [ _",

    "at this point we have two integration constants @xmath556 and we will fix their values momentarily . substituting the expressions ( [ solutone ] ) into ( [ ansgausugra ] ) , we find the solution of gauged supergravity & & ds^2=-(2h_0)^2 fh^-4/5dt^2 + + & & a_t^(1)=h_0 h^-1,e^=h^-,2=_r(rh ) first we notice that by rescaling @xmath557 and @xmath551 we can set @xmath558 to any value , we will choose this value to be @xmath559 . then we see that the metric , matter fields and equation ( [ nontriveqn ] ) can all be expressed in terms of coordinate @xmath560 , then @xmath551 never appears explicitly .",
    "after this is done we can define a new coordinate @xmath561 instead of the coordinate @xmath214 , which is equivalent to setting @xmath551 to zero .",

    "another useful approximation is to drop the 1 in equation ( [ theequation2 ] ) , which is valid for @xmath574 .",
