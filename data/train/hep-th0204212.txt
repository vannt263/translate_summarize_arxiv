    "structure and complexity have developed in our universe , because it is out of equilibrium .",
    "this feature shows up in all known cosmological scenarios for the early universe , which rely on gravitational instability to generate local inhomogeneities from an almost homogeneous and isotropic state for the universe .",
    "inflation seems the best explanation for this homogeneous and isotropic state because whatever drives the inflation will remove the local instability and iron out irregularities .",
    "however the inflationary expansion has to be globally unstable because otherwise it would continue forever and galaxies would never form .    the instability can be described as the evolution of an order parameter @xmath0 which can be treated as a scalar field with effective potential @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath2 is small , @xmath0 will roll slowly down the potential and the universe will inflate by a large factor .",
    "however , this raises the question : why did the universe start with a high value of the potential ?",
    "why did nt @xmath0 start at the global minimum of @xmath3 ?",
    "there have been various attempts to explain why @xmath0 started high on the potential hill . in the old @xcite and new @xcite inflationary scenarios",
    "the universe was supposed to start with infinite temperature at a singularity .",
    "as the universe expanded and cooled , thermal corrections would make the effective potential time dependent .",
    "so even if @xmath0 started in the minimum of @xmath3 , it could still end up in a metastable false vacuum state ( in old inflation ) or at a local maximum of @xmath3 ( in new inflation ) . the scalar field",
    "was then supposed to tunnel through the potential barrier or just fall off the top of the hill and slowly roll down . however both scenarios tended to predict a more inhomogeneous universe than we observe .",
    "they were also unsatisfactory because they assumed an initial singularity and a fairly homogeneous and isotropic pre - inflation hot big bang phase .",
    "why not just assume the singularity produced the standard hot big bang , since we do nt have a measure on the space of singular initial conditions for the universe ?    in the chaotic inflation scenario @xcite , quantum fluctuations of @xmath0",
    "are supposed to drive the volume weighted average @xmath0 up the potential hill , leading to everlasting eternal inflation .",
    "however this effect is dependent on using the synchronous gauge : in other gauges the volume weighted average of the potential can go down . looking from a 4 rather than 3 + 1 dimensional perspective ,",
    "it is clear that the quantum fluctuations of a single scalar field are insufficient to drive de sitter like eternal inflation , if the de sitter space is larger than the planck length .",
    "eternal inflation may be possible at the planck scale , but all our methods would break down in this situation so it would mean that we could not analyze the origin of the universe .",
    "the aim of this paper however is to show that the universe can come into being and start inflating without the need for an initial hot big bang phase or planck curvature .",
    "it is required that the potential @xmath3 has a local maximum which is below the planck density and sufficiently flat on top , @xmath4 .",
    "this last condition means only the homogeneous mode of the scalar field is tachyonic : the higher modes all have positive eigenvalues .",
    "it also means there is nt a coleman - de luccia solution @xcite describing quantum tunneling from a false vacuum on one side of the maximum to the true vacuum on the other side .",
    "instead there is only a homogeneous hawking - moss instanton @xcite that sits on the top of the hill , at the local maximum of @xmath5 .",
    "it has long been a problem to understand how the universe could decay from a false vacuum in this situation .",
    "the hawking - moss instanton does not interpolate between the false and true vacua , because it is constant in space and time . instead",
    ", what must happen is that the original universe can continue in the false vacuum state but that new completely disconnected universes can form at the top of the hill via hawking - moss instantons . for someone in one of these new universes ,",
    "the universe in the false vacuum is irrelevant and can be ignored .",
    "the top of the hill might seem the least likely place for the universe to start .",
    "however we shall show it is the most likely place for an inflationary universe to begin , if @xmath4 .",
    "the reason is that although being at the top of the hill costs potential action , the saving of gradient action from having a constant scalar field is greater .",
    "thus inflation will start at the top of the hill .",
    "in particular , this justifies starobinsky s scenario of trace anomaly inflation , in which the universe starts in an unstable de sitter state supported by the conformal anomaly of a large number of conformally coupled matter fields @xcite .",
    "the usual approach to the problem of initial conditions for inflation , is to assume some initial configuration for the universe , and evolve it forward in time .",
    "this could be described as the bottom up approach to cosmology .",
    "it is an essentially classical picture , because it assumes there is a single well defined metric for the universe . by contrast , here we adopt a quantum approach , based on the no boundary proposal @xcite , which states that the amplitude for an observable like the 3-metric on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath6 , is given by a path integral over all metrics whose only boundary is @xmath6 .",
    "the quantum origin of our universe and the no boundary proposal naturally lead to a top down view of the universe , in which the histories that contribute to the path integral , depend on the observable being measured .",
    "we study the quantum cosmological origin of an expanding universe in theories like trace anomaly inflation , by investigating the semiclassical predictions of the no boundary proposal for the wave function of interest .",
    "one may argue that a clearer picture of the pre - inflationary conditions can only emerge from a deeper understanding of quantum gravity at the planck scale .",
    "however , the amplitude of the cosmic microwave temperature anisotropies indicates that the universe may always have been much larger than the planck scale .",
    "this suggests it might be possible to describe the origin of our universe within the semiclassical regime of quantum cosmology .",
    "correspondingly , the effective potential must have a local maximum well below the planck density , which is the case in the trace anomaly model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we review trace anomaly driven inflation , since this provides an important theoretical motivation for inflation .",
    "we study the quantum cosmology of the trace anomaly model and discuss the role of a special class of instanton saddle - points of the no boundary path integral , which can be analytically continued to lorentzian universes . in section 3",
    "we consider perturbations in anomaly - induced inflation and show that the instability of the inflationary phase can be described by a scalar field with an effective potential with a local maximum .",
    "we also discuss homogeneous fluctuations about the instanton backgrounds and touch briefly on the effect of quantum matter on the spectrum of microwave fluctuations predicted by anomaly - induced inflation . in section 4 , we consider a general model of inflation with an effective potential that has a local maximum .",
    "we show that according to the no boundary proposal , provided the instability is sufficiently weak , an expanding universe is most likely to start at the top of the hill , in a de sitter state .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "it has been argued that the theoretical foundations for inflation are weak , since it has proven difficult to realise inflation in classical m - theory .",
    "a large class of supergravity theories admit no warped de sitter compactifications on a compact , static internal space @xcite and although some gauged @xmath8 and @xmath9 supergravities in @xmath10 do permit de sitter vacua @xcite , these vacua are too unstable for a significant period of inflation to occur",
    ". however , an appealing way to evade the no go theorems is to include higher derivative quantum corrections to the classical supergravity equations , such as the trace anomaly .",
    "since we observe a large number of matter fields in the universe , it is natural to consider the large @xmath7 approximation @xcite . in the large @xmath7 approximation ,",
    "one performs the path integral over the matter fields in a given background to obtain an effective action that is a functional of the background metric , ( -w[*g * ] ) = d [ ] ( -s [ ; * g * ] ) . in the leading - order @xmath11 approximation",
    ", one can neglect graviton loops and look for a stationary point of the effective action for the matter fields combined with the gravitational action .",
    "this is equivalent to solving the einstein equations with the source being the expectation value of the matter energy - momentum tensor derived from @xmath12 , r _ - r g _ = 8 g t _ .",
    "the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor is generally non - local and depends on the quantum state .",
    "however , during inflation , particle masses are small compared with the spacetime curvature , @xmath13 , and in asymptotically free gauge theories , interactions become negligible in the same limit . therefore , at the high curvatures during inflation , the energy - momentum tensor of a large class of grand unified theories is to a good approximation given by the expectation value @xmath14 of a large number of free , massless , conformally invariant fields is small at high curvature , as long as the couplings do nt become very large @xcite . ] . the entire one - loop contribution to",
    "the trace of the energy - momentum tensor then comes from the conformal anomaly @xcite , which is given for a general cft by the following equation , [ eqn : anomform ] g^ t _ = c f - a g +  ^2",

    "the trace anomaly is entirely geometrical in origin and therefore independent of the quantum state . in a maximally symmetric spacetime",
    ", the symmetry of the vacuum implies that the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor is proportional to the metric , 0| t _",
    "g^ 0| t _ |0 .",
    "thus the trace anomaly acts just like a cosmological constant for these spacetimes , and a positive trace anomaly permits a de sitter solution to the einstein equations .",
    "the radius of the de sitter solution is determined by the number of fields , @xmath22 , in the cft and is of order @xmath23 .",
    "therefore the one - loop contributions to the energy - momentum tensor are @xmath24 , which means they are of the same order as the classical terms in the einstein equations . on the other hand ,",

    "for a solution to exist that interpolates between these two stages , one must have @xmath28 in [ eqn : anomform ] , as starobinsky discovered @xcite .",
    "starobinsky showed that if @xmath28 , the de sitter solution is unstable , and decays into a matter dominated friedman - lemaitre robertson - walker universe , on a timescale determined by @xmath18 .",
    "the purpose of starobinsky s work was to demonstrate that quantum effects of matter fields might resolve the big bang singularity . from a modern perspective , it is more interesting that the conformal anomaly might have been the source of a finite , but significant period of inflation in the early universe .",
    "rapid oscillations in the expansion rate at the end of inflation , would result in particle production and ( p)reheating .",
    "starobinsky showed that the de sitter solution is unstable both to the future and to the past , so it was not clear how the universe could have entered the de sitter phase .",
    "this is the problem of initial conditions for trace anomaly driven inflation , which should be addressed within the framework of quantum cosmology , by combining inflation with a theory for the wave function @xmath29 of the quantum universe .",
    "hartle and hawking suggested that the amplitude for the quantum state of the universe described by 3-metric @xmath30 and matter fields @xmath31 on a 3-surface @xmath6 , should be given by [ nbp ] = n _ m [ * g * ] d[(*x * ) ] e^-s_e(*g * , ) , where the euclidean path integral is taken over all compact four geometries bounded only by a 3-surface @xmath6 , with induced metric @xmath30 and matter fields @xmath32 .",

    "one can construct more sophisticated models of anomaly driven inflation , by taking in account corrections from particle masses and interactions in a more precise way .",

    "the coefficient @xmath18 could then vary in time , because the decoupling of massive sparticles at low energy @xcite alters the number of degrees of freedom that contribute to the quantum effective action . for our purposes , however , it is sufficient to consider the theory above .    in no boundary cosmology ,",

    "this is not the case , however , since the no boundary prescription to compute lorentzian propagators by wick rotation from the euclidean , implicitly imposes the final boundary condition that the fields remain bounded , which eliminates the runaways @xcite .",
    "the path integral [ path ] is gaussian , so the correlation functions can be read off from the perturbed action , equation [ eqn : cftgenfun2 ] and [ ehper ] : [ eqn : scalarcorrelator ] ( x ) ( x ) = ( -^2 + 1/2)^-1 , and [ eqn : tensorcorrelator ] _ ( x ) _",
    "(x ) = _ p=2^ , where the bitensor @xmath96 is defined as the usual sum over degenerate rank-2 harmonics on the four sphere and @xmath97 is given by [ cftten ] .",
    "the scalar two - point function [ eqn : scalarcorrelator ] is just the propagator of a particle with physical mass @xmath98 . since we are assuming @xmath73",
    ", we have @xmath99 so this particle is a tachyon , which is the perturbative manifestation of the starobinsky instability . making @xmath85 more negative ,",
    "makes the tachyon mass squared less negative , and therefore weakens the instability .",
    "indeed , the number of efoldings in the primordial de sitter phase emerging from the four sphere instanton is given by @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , in the interesting regime , we have @xmath101 , so semiclassical gravity should be a good approximation .",
    "this result sheds light on the problem of initial conditions in trace anomaly inflation .",
    "one can think of the non derivative term in the scalar correlator as a potential @xmath102 , with the unperturbed de sitter solution at @xmath103 at the maximum . if @xmath104 is not too small , then the top of the potential is sufficiently flat , so that the lowest - action regular instanton is a homogeneous hawking - moss instanton @xcite , with @xmath105 constant at the top . since the instability of the de sitter phase is characterised entirely by the coefficient @xmath85 of the @xmath62 counterterm .",
    "this means the problem of initial conditions in anomaly - induced inflation is similar to the corresponding problem in many theories of scalar field inflation , where one ought to explain why the inflaton starts initially at the top of the hill .",
    "we study the origin of these inflationary universes in section iv . before doing so , however , we comment on the homogeneous mode in the scalar spectrum , which has given rise to some controversy in the literature .      the most interesting instantons in both trace anomaly driven inflation as well as most theories of scalar field inflation possess a homogeneous fluctuation mode which decreases their action @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a negative mode is the perturbative manifestation of the conformal factor problem . indeed , since the conformal factor problem is closely related to the instability of gravity under gravitational collapse , one expects instantons that are appealing from a cosmological perspective , to possess a negative mode .",
    "writing the scalar propagator [ eqn : scalarcorrelator ] on the four sphere instanton in momentum space gives [ eqn : scor ] ( x ) ( x ) = _ p=0^ , where the biscalar @xmath106 equals the usual sum over degenerate scalar harmonics on the four sphere with eigenvalue @xmath107 of the laplacian .",
    "there are many negative modes if @xmath108 .",
    "this is usually the perturbative indication of the existence of a lower - action instanton solution .",
    "for instance , in scalar field inflation with a double well potential , the hawking - moss instanton possesses several negative modes if @xmath109 , which is precisely the condition for the existence of a lower - action coleman - de luccia instanton that straddles the maximum . on the other hand , if @xmath110 in [ eqn : scor ] then only the homogeneous ( @xmath111 ) negative mode remains , which is again similar to the well - known negative homogeneous mode of the hawking - moss instanton in theories with a scalar potential that is sufficiently flat .",
    "the presence of a physical negative mode supports the interpretation of an instanton as describing the decay of an unstable state through semiclassical tunneling @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that it questions its use in the no boundary path integral to define the initial quantum state of the universe @xcite . within the semiclassical approximation , however , it is more appropriate to project out the negative mode , since the semiclassical approach is based on the _ assumption _ that the path integral can be expanded around solutions of the classical field equations .",
    "the conclusions of @xcite are based on a perturbation calculation around compact , real instanton backgrounds , that does not take in account the wave function of interest .",
    "one expects , however , the configuration specifying the quantum state of the lorentzian universe to project out the negative mode from the perturbation spectrum . consider for example the wave function of a universe described by a 3-sphere with radius @xmath112 and field @xmath113 , in a theory of gravity coupled to a single scalar field with potential @xmath114 . in the semiclassical approximation , this is given by half of a hawking - moss instanton with the field constant at the top of the potential .",
    "obviously , this solution has no negative mode , since the boundary condition on the 3-sphere @xmath6 removes the lowest eigenvalue solution of the schrdinger equation for the perturbations .",
    "since the negative mode corresponds to a homogeneous fluctuation , this is probably true also for large 3-spheres in the lorentzian regime .",
    "therefore , one expects that in the top down approach to cosmology , where the quantum state of the universe is taken in account , the negative mode is automatically projected out .      before discussing the top down approach in more detail",
    ", we pause to briefly comment on some of the characteristic predictions for observations of trace anomaly inflation .    to extract accurate predictions for the cosmic microwave anisotropies , one must evolve the perturbations through the starobinsky instability , to obtain initial conditions for the inhomogeneities during the radiation and matter eras .",
    "details of this calculation will be presented elsewhere @xcite , but some interesting features of the microwave temperature anisotropies predicted by anomaly - induced inflation , can be extracted from the correlators [ eqn : scalarcorrelator ] and [ eqn : tensorcorrelator ] in the primordial de sitter era . obviously , as can be seen from [ eqn : tensorcorrelator ] , the quantum matter couples to the tensors .",
    "starobinsky @xcite and vilenkin",
    "@xcite assumed that the amplitude of primordial gravity waves was not significantly altered by the quantum matter loops .",
    "this assumption can now be examined using ads / cft , which has allowed us to include the effect of the weyl@xmath115 counterterm and the non - local part of the matter effective action .",
    "we find that at small scales , matter fields dominate the tensor propagator and make it decay like @xmath116 . in other words ,",
    "the cft appears to give spacetime a rigidity on small scales , an example of how quantum loops of matter can change gravity at short distances .",
    "in fact , this suppression should occur even if inflation is not driven by the trace anomaly , since we observe a large number of matter fields , whose effective action is expected to dominate the propagator on small scales .    secondly , both the higher derivative counterterms and the matter fields introduce anisotropic stress , which is an important difference with scalar field inflation .",
    "this can be seen from decomposing the tensors @xmath95 into a scalar @xmath117 and tensor @xmath118 under @xmath49 .",
    "the former is the difference between the two potentials in the newtonian gauge and corresponds to anisotropic stress .",
    "typically reheating at the end of anomaly - induced inflation leads to creation of particles that are not in thermal equilibrium with the photon - baryon fluid , so one expects some anisotropic stress to survive during the radiation era . to make more precise predictions , however ,",
    "a better understanding is required of the ( probably time - dependent ) values of the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath65 of the higher derivative counterterms in the theory .",
    "finally , we should mention that for the tensor propagator the higher derivative terms also give rise to poles in the complex @xmath63-plane .",
    "these are harmless , however , since the contour obtained from the euclidean goes around the complex poles @xcite . in other words , defining our theory in the euclidean , implicitly removes the instabilities associated with the complex poles , like a final boundary condition removes the runaway solution of the classical radiation reaction force @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the predictions of the bottom up approach to the problem of initial conditions in inflation do not agree with observation .",
    "this is because it is based on an essentially classical picture , in which one assumes some initial condition for the universe and evolves it forward in time . the quantum origin of our universe ,",
    "however , means that its wave function is determined by a path integral , in which one sums over all possible histories that lead to a given quantum state , together with some suitable boundary conditions on the paths .",
    "this naturally leads to a top down view of the universe . in a top down context , rather than comparing the relative probabilities of different semiclassical geometries , one looks for the most probable evolution that leads to a certain outcome .",
    "we now apply the quantum top down interpretation of the no boundary proposal to study the origin of an inflationary universe , in theories where the instability of the inflationary phase can be described in terms of a single scalar field with an effective potential that has a local maximum . as shown in section iii , this includes trace anomaly driven inflation , since the emergence of an anomaly driven inflationary universe is very similar to the creation of an exponentially expanding universe in theories of new inflation .",
    "we consider a model consisting of gravity coupled to a single scalar field , with a double well potential @xmath119 ( with @xmath120 ) . for @xmath121 ,",
    "the potential has a maximum at @xmath113 with @xmath122 sufficiently low so that there exists no coleman - de luccia instanton , but only a hawking - moss instanton with @xmath113 everywhere on top of the hill . implementing a top down approach , we consider the quantum amplitudes @xmath123 $ ] for different conformal 3-geometries @xmath124 with trace @xmath125 of the second fundamental form , on an expanding surface @xmath6 during inflation just inside our past light cone , with @xmath125 equal to the present hubble rate and given values for all other observables .",

    "the action of the hawking - moss geometry is given by the first term in [ pert ] .",

    "in addition , within our approximation @xmath32 enters only in the prefactor of @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , the dominant contribution to the no boundary path integral for a lorentzian inflating universe comes from spacetimes which are created by semiclassical tunneling via a hawking ",
    "moss instanton and which inflate for a long time before a quantum fluctuation causes the field to roll down to its final value @xmath32 .",
    "this means that in an inflationary universe , the scalar field is more likely to start at the top of the hill and roll down , than to start lower down .",
    "the reason is that although being at the top of the hill costs potential energy , it saves gradient energy , by having a scalar field that is constant in space and time .",
    "if the maximum of the potential is fairly flat , the gradient energy is dominant , and the universe starts with a constant scalar , at the top of the hill .",
    "therefore , one does not need an initial hot big bang phase , to explain why inflation began at a local maximum of the potential .    as mentioned above ,",
    "this scenario is realised in trace anomaly driven inflation .",
    "the unperturbed de sitter solution [ dssol ] in anomaly - induced inflation emerges from the hawking - moss geometry , while the inhomogeneous hawking - turok evolution corresponds to one of the singular instantons discussed in section ii .",

    "finally , we should mention that because we are interested in real matter fields on @xmath6 , the analytic continuation into the complex @xmath125-plane means @xmath117 must be complex in the bulk of the instanton invariant geometries considered here are in fact the lowest - action saddle - points that contribute to the wave function of interest . ] .",

    "we have investigated the no boundary predictions for the quantum cosmological origin of a large class of inflationary universes .",
    "in particular , we have considered theories of inflation where the global instability can be described in terms of a single scalar field @xmath117 with an effective potential that has a sufficiently flat local maximum .",
    "this includes starobinsky s trace anomaly model , since the nature of the initial instability in anomaly - induced inflation is the same as the instability that occurs in new inflation .",
    "trace anomaly driven inflation has a sound motivation in fundamental particle physics , since we observe a large number of matter fields in the universe , which may be expected to behave like a cft in the early universe .",

    "the universe first inflates , before a quantum fluctuation causes the field to roll down and inflation to end .",
    "provided @xmath155 , the maximum of the potential is sufficiently flat , so that this geometry has lower action than an inhomogeneous hawking - turok type evolution .",
    "one could think of the no boundary proposal as describing the creation of universes with different radii , like the formation of bubbles of steam . if the bubbles are small , they collapse again , but there is a critical size above which they are more likely to grow . in theories where the amplitude for an expanding universe is dominated by geometries that start in a de sitter state , this naturally leads to the interpretation of the round hawking - moss instanton on top of the hill as corresponding to that critical size .",
    "correlators of observables on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath6 should be computed directly from the no boundary path integral , by summing over histories to the past of that surface . in the semiclassical approximation",

    "we have argued that because our universe has a quantum origin , one must adopt a top down approach to the problem of initial conditions in cosmology , in which the histories that contribute to the path integral , depend on the observable being measured .",
    "there is an amplitude for empty flat space , but it is not of much significance .",
    "similarly , the other bubbles in an eternally inflating spacetime are irrelevant .",
    "they are to the future of our past light cone , so they do nt contribute to the action for observables and should be excised by ockham s razor . therefore , the top down approach is a mathematical formulation of the weak anthropic principle . instead of starting with a universe and asking what a typical observer would see , one specifies the amplitude of interest . in the context of the no boundary proposal , however , a top down description of the universe is not necessarily less ` complete ' or less predictive .",
    "we believe that if we are to explain why the universe is the way we observe it to be , a top down view is forced upon us by the quantum nature of the universe . therefore , although future developments in m - theory will provide us with new insights in how a theory of boundary conditions in cosmology should be formulated , the approach developed here should still apply when the framework of quantum cosmology will be based on m - theory ."
