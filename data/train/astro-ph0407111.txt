    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been established beyond any doubt , and the formation and evolution of cosmological structures through gravitational attraction is reasonably well understood .",
    "the velocity distribution of the resulting structures , however , remains unknown .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the well established velocity distribution of ideal gases , @xmath6 , which is derived from the extensive boltzmann - gibbs entropy .",
    "dark matter , however , experiences long - range gravitational interaction , and may therefore not obey the rule of extensivity .    at the same time numerical simulations provide predictions of steep central density cusps with power law slopes , @xmath7 , with @xmath0 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 within a few percent of the virial radius of the halo  @xcite .",
    "however , recent careful studies  @xcite indicate that the resolved region has still not converged on a central density slope .",
    "analytical analyses of the jeans equations seem to indicate that the most shallow allowed slope is @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "such steep inner numerically resolved slopes are , however , not supported by observations . by measuring the rotation curve of a galaxy",
    "one can in principle determine the density profile of its dm halo .",
    "low surface brightness galaxies and spirals , where the observed dynamics should be dm dominated , seem to show slowly rising rotation curves @xcite indicating that these dm halos have constant density cores .",
    "galaxy clusters , where baryons can play even less of a role , may show a similar discrepancy .",
    "arcs @xcite and strong lensing fits of multiple image configurations and brightnesses @xcite also indicate shallow cores in clusters .    facing this apparent disagreement between observations and numerical simulations",
    "it is very important to understand if the pure dark matter central density slopes are constrained from a fundamental statistical mechanics point of view .",
    "we will here combine an analytical and a numerical approach .",
    "first we show that the dark matter distribution functions are exactly the ones derived from non - extensive statistical mechanics .",
    "we then find a connection between the density slope , @xmath0 , and the entropic index , @xmath2 .",
    "a given theoretical bound on @xmath2 will then lead to a bound on @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the bounds we can imagine still allow any density slope , including a core with @xmath11 .",
    "the outer slope is bounded by @xmath12 , which is close to the findings of n - body codes .",
    "our findings can be very useful and directly applicable if one can envisage stronger theoretical bounds on @xmath2 .",
    "let us first derive the actual velocity distribution function of self gravitating collisionless structures numerically .",
    "we will be considering the simplest possible dark matter structures ( actually any collisionless system , including star clusters ) , which are spherical and isotropic . according to recent numerical n - body results",
    "this is a reasonably good approximation in the central equilibrated part of dark matter structures .",
    "we will argue later that statistical mechanics in a natural way forces a system towards isotropy . any given density profile , @xmath13 ,",
    "can be inverted  @xcite to give the particle velocity distribution function , @xmath14 , through @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the relative potential as a function of radius , and @xmath17 is the relative energy , @xmath18 . for recent applications and technical details",
    "see  @xcite . for the numerical inversion",
    "we typically consider structures with 10 orders of magnitude in radius , and always confirm that the resulting velocity distributions have converged .",
    "we consider only isotropic structures and leave non - isotropy for a future analysis . for simplicity",
    "we construct very simple structures which depend only on one free parameter , namely the density slope @xmath0 , from @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting velocity distribution functions are presented as ( coloured ) symbols in figure 1 for the slopes @xmath20 and @xmath21 .     and @xmath21 .",
    "the solid lines are the theoretical formulae from tsallis statistics , using entropic indices of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the curves are arbitrarily normalized , and use different velocity dispersion , @xmath24 , in order to make the figure more readable and the difference in shapes more evident .",
    "the labels describe the lines from left to right.,width=302,height=245 ]    it is important to note that for @xmath25 there is a maximal velocity .",
    "this is a real feature , purely related to the density profile , and is not simply the result of a finite structure .",
    "this shows directly that the velocity distribution function can not be an exponential or any sum of exponentials , since exponential functions have tails going to infinite energy .",
    "we have thus shown explicitely that the often discussed sum of exponentials  @xcite can not be correct , and instead a more general functional form for the velocity distribution function must be sought .",
    "we will now turn to non - extensive thermo - statistics and show that the correct functional form for the velocity distribution function is easy to derive .",
    "statistical mechanics for classical gases can be derived from the boltzmann - gibbs assumption for the entropy , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the probability for a given particle to be in the state @xmath28 , and the sum is over all states . for normal gases",
    "the probability , @xmath29 , coincides with the velocity distribution function , @xmath30 .",
    "this classical statistics can be generalized to tsallis ( or non - extensive ) statistics  @xcite , which depends on the entropic index @xmath2 @xmath31 where the q - logarithm is defined by , ln@xmath32 , and for @xmath33 the normal boltzmann - gibbs entropy is recovered , @xmath34 .",
    "the probabilities still obey , @xmath35 , while the particle distribution function is now given by @xmath36 .",
    "thus , for @xmath37 one privileges rare events , whereas @xmath38 privileges common events .",
    "one also sees directly that entropy is maximized for isotropic distributions , which supports our original isotropy assumption . for a summary of applications",
    "see  @xcite , and for up to date list of references see http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br/biblio.htm .",
    "average values are calculated through the particle distribution function , and one e.g. has the mean energy  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the energy eigenvalues .",
    "optimization of the entropy in eq .",
    "( [ stsallis ] ) under the constraints leads to the probability  @xcite @xmath42 ^{1/(1-q)}}{z_q } \\",
    ", , \\label{eq : pi1}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 normalizes the probabilities , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the optimization lagrange multiplier associated with the average energy . adding a constant energy , @xmath46 , to all the energy eigenvalues leads to @xmath47 , which leaves all the probabilities , @xmath27 , invariant  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath48 is positive , where @xmath49 then eq .  ( [ eq : pi1 ] ) can be written as @xmath50 on figure 1 we plot 4 solid ( black ) lines , corresponding to @xmath51 and @xmath23 , and well chosen @xmath45 s .",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that the velocity distribution function , @xmath30 , inverted from a density distribution function with slope @xmath52 , where @xmath7 , is extremely well fitted with the non - extensive form in  eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) using @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , the maxwell distribution ( the exponential , @xmath33 ) is recovered with an isothermal sphere ( with @xmath54 ) , and finally , the @xmath55 is well fitted with @xmath56 .",
    "one should keep in mind that the probabilities , @xmath29 , are related to the physical distributions through @xmath57 .",
    "we consider this excellent agreement in figure 1 as a strong indicator that equilibrium self gravitating structures indeed are to be described by non - extensive statistical mechanics .",
    "we are thus giving theoretical support to the use of tsallis entropy ( and the resulting velocity distribution function ) when analysing gravitational structures .",
    "such analysis was first conducted in  @xcite , where an entropic index of @xmath58 was found to describe accurately the peculiar velocity of galaxy clusters .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the maximal velocity for @xmath37 , @xmath59 is an inherent property of the non - extensive thermo - statistics ( for @xmath37 ) and is not related to any finite size of the system .",
    "we also note that the @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) may be important for cluster temperature observations  @xcite .",
    "the structures we are considering are polytropes , which are described by the polytropic index , @xmath60 , making the connection between pressure and density , @xmath61 .",
    "it was first shown analytically by @xcite that these structures are exactly described by non - extensive statistical mechanics , and a connection was found between @xmath60 and the entropic index , @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the finding of this section is a numerical confirmation of the original work of @xcite , which says that the distribution function for polytropes is infact given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) . as we will discuss below",
    ", the actual connection between @xmath60 and @xmath2 is not clear from the literature , and our independent results are useful in distinguishing which of the analytical results is correct .    naturally , for a more general density profile where @xmath0 is not constant , the actual velocity distribution function will be a sum over terms of the shape given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) , with @xmath36 . one can only approximate the velocity distribution function with one term of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) when @xmath62 varies sufficiently slowly with radius .",
    "we can now proceed as in the previous section with various density profiles , and find the corresponding @xmath2 .",
    "the result is presented in figure 2 .",
    "the fitted @xmath2 s are accurate at the few percent level .",
    "this figure is presented only in the range @xmath63 , since steeper slopes lead to numerical problems in our simple inversion of eddington s formula .",
    "this is not a problem since we are interested in exactly this range in density profiles .",
    "as pointed out in section 3 , our numerical finding that the self - gravitating structures are described by non - extensive statistical mechanics was first shown analytically by @xcite",
    ". there seems , however , to be some confusion in the literature , as to what the connection between @xmath60 and @xmath2 really is .",
    "polytropes follow the lane - emden equation , and for power - law density profiles one thus has , @xmath64 .",
    "now , there are 3 different connections between @xmath60 and @xmath2 frequently used in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite for different expressions ) and we can therefore use our independent numerical method to distinguish which is the correct one .",
    "we find that the formula derived in @xcite , @xmath65 fits our results very well .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the correct connection between the density slope , @xmath0 , and the entropic index , @xmath2 , is given by @xmath66 this is shown as the thin ( green ) solid line in figure 2 .",
    "we note that this equation may play an important role in explaining the observed correlation between the density slope and the anisotropy of dark matter structures  @xcite .    , gives a specific distribution function , @xmath30 , which can be fitted with two free parameters , namely the entropic index , @xmath2 , and the velocity dispersion , @xmath24 .",
    "we present the resulting @xmath2 as a function of the density slope , @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical limit of @xmath67 is presented with a dashed line .",
    "the thin ( green ) solid line is the curve given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qgamma]).,width=302,height=245 ]    it is interesting to ask the question : which are the theoretical constraints on the entropic index @xmath2 ?",
    "we saw above that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) is only valid for positive @xmath48 .",
    "actually the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) is also valid for negative @xmath48 , however , a negative effective temperature ( a negative velocity dispersion in our case ) , @xmath68 is difficult to interpret for cosmological structures . since we find numerically that @xmath69 , one sees that @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "the same conclusion , namely @xmath67 , was reached by @xcite by demanding a positive proportion between temperature and internal energy ; and also reached by @xcite through an analysis of the velocity dispersion .",
    "we see in figure 2 , that @xmath71 corresponds to a cored dark matter distribution with @xmath72 .",
    "thus all dark matter density slopes are allowed from a fundamental statistical mechanics point of view .",
    "our findings are directly applicable if one can imagine a stronger theoretical bound on @xmath2 .",
    "e.g. @xcite considered the ideal gas case , and found that positiveness of the thermal conductivity leads to .",
    "such a bound would according to our figure 2 imply a bound on the central density profile of @xmath73 , in agreement with numerical and analytical suggestions  @xcite .",
    "it has indeed been suggested  @xcite that the numerical methods induce an artificial conductivity , which would then imply a central slope of @xmath74 .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath2 is given by @xmath75  @xcite , which implies a bound on the dark matter profile of @xmath76 , when using eq .",
    "( [ eq : qgamma ] ) .",
    "this is very close to the findings of numerical simulations , which is @xmath77 .",
    "further , if one would have a bound of @xmath78 ( as suggested by  @xcite ) , then one would have a bound on the outer density profile of @xmath77 .",
    "we compare the velocity distribution function for self gravitating collisionless structures ( e.g. dark matter or star clusters ) with the analytical expectation from non - extensive statistical mechanics , and find excellent agreement between the two .",
    "this is a strong indication that self gravitating systems of collisionless particles must be described by non - extensive statistical mechanics .",
    "we identify a connection between the density power slope , @xmath0 , from @xmath7 , and the entropic index , @xmath2 , from the generalized entropy , @xmath3 .",
    "we show that @xmath2 is only bounded from above by @xmath67 , which implies that all dark matter central slopes are allowed from this fundamental statistical mechanics point of view , including central cores with @xmath11 .",
    "we show that the outer density slope is bounded by @xmath79 .",
    "if one can imagine stronger theoretical bounds on @xmath2 then our findings are directly applicable to give stronger bounds on the allowed density slope .",
