    "thermodynamics of systems with long range interactions is quite distinct from that of systems where the interactions are short ranged . for pairwise interactions , long range potentials decay at large distances as @xmath0 with @xmath1 in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "such systems are _ not extensive _ , although models used to describe them can be made extensive by an appropriate volume dependent rescaling ( the kac prescription )  @xcite .",
    "however , even with such rescaling , these models remain inherently _ non - additive_. namely , when divided into two or more macroscopic subsystems , the total energy ( or other extensive quantity ) of the system , is not necessarily equal to the sum of the energies of the subsystems . since additivity is an essential ingredient in the derivation of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of systems with short range interactions , its violation may lead to interesting and unusual effects .    to illustrate the lack of additivity in these systems consider an extremely simple example of an ising model with infinite range , mean - field like , interactions , corresponding to @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spin @xmath6 variable on site @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the number of spins in the system .",
    "this kac type pre - factor is taken to ensure _ extensivity_.",
    "let us consider for simplicity a system with vanishing magnetization , @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that the energy , @xmath10 , of the system satisfies @xmath11 .",
    "now let us divide the system into two subsystems , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , each composed of @xmath14 sites , where all spins in subsystem @xmath12 are up while those in subsystem @xmath13 are down ( see fig .  [ plusminus ] ) .",
    "the energies of the two subsystems , @xmath15 and @xmath16 satisfy @xmath17 . since the sum of the two energies @xmath18 is not equal to the total energy @xmath19",
    "the system is clearly not additive .",
    "the lack of additivity may result in many unusual properties of systems with long range interactions , like inequivalence of various ensembles , negative specific heat in the microcanonical ensemble and possible temperature discontinuity at first order transitions .",
    "for example , the usual argument for the non - negativity of the specific heat , or equivalently , for the concavity of the entropy - energy curve @xmath20 , makes use of the fact that systems with short range interactions are additive . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the entropy and energy per particle , respectively . an entropy curve which is not concave in the energy interval @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ convex ] ) is unstable for systems with short range interactions since entropy may be gained by phase separating the system into two subsystems with energy densities @xmath24 and @xmath25 while keeping the total energy fixed .",
    "in particular the average energy and entropy densities in the coexistence region is given by the weighted average of the corresponding densities of the two coexisting systems , and thus the correct entropy curve in that region is given by the common tangent line ( see fig .",
    "[ convex ] ) , resulting in an overall concave curve . on the other hand for systems with long range interactions ,",
    "additivity does not hold , and thus it is not always the case that entropy may be gained by phase separation . in such cases",
    "the non - concave entropy curve may in fact be the correct entropy of the system , resulting , for example , in negative specific heat .",
    "self gravitating particles are perhaps the most extensively studied systems with long range forces ( corresponding to @xmath26 in @xmath27 dimensions ) .",
    "the fact that the entropy of these systems is not necessarily a concave function of the energy has first been pointed out by antonov  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical consequences of this observation have been elaborated using simple models by lynden - bell  @xcite , thirring  @xcite and others ( see also the papers by chavanis  @xcite and padhmanaban  @xcite in this book for a review ) .",
    "in fact , non - additivity is not limited to systems with long range interactions .",
    "finite systems with short range interactions , such as atomic clusters , are non - additive as long as they are small enough so that surface energy may not be neglected as compared with the bulk energy  @xcite .",
    "negative specific heat in clusters of atoms has been discussed by r. m. lynden - bell  @xcite and it has been recently observed experimentally , as discussed in this book in refs .  @xcite .    in the present paper we consider a simple spin 1 mean - field model ( @xmath28 ) and study its phase diagram both within the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles .",
    "this model , known as the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model  @xcite , may serve as a useful tool for studying thermodynamic effects which characterize systems with long range interactions .",
    "the canonical phase diagram of this model has been studied in the past , and it exhibits a line of phase transitions separating a magnetically ordered phase from a paramagnetic one .",
    "the line is composed of a first order transition and a second order transition segments separated by a tricritical point .",
    "the microcanonical phase diagram on the other hand exhibits some rather distinct features  @xcite .",
    "while the second order segment of the canonical phase diagram is present also in the microcanonical ensemble , the nature of the first order segment , its location and the location of the tricritical point are rather different . in this ensemble ,",
    "a region with negative specific heat is found , as well as a first order transition at which the temperatures of the two coexisting phases are different .",

    "we now present some general considerations concerning the intricate relation between canonical and microcanonical ensembles .",

    "as explained above , the microcanonical entropy is @xmath133 and the magnetization in the microcanonical ensemble is the point where the maximum is reached .",
    "+ all questions are now reduced to the solution of the two variational problems ( [ canoproblem ] ) and ( [ microproblem ] ) .",
    "the first order conditions are the same for the two problems @xmath134 where the second condition is indeed given in the microcanonical case by the definition of temperature .",
    "we will denote by @xmath135 the solution of the variational problem ( [ variational ] ) . using ( [ variational ] ) , it is straightforward to verify that @xmath136 meaning that the canonical mean energy coincides with the minimizing energy . hence , the extrema in ( [ canoproblem ] ) and in ( [ microproblem ] ) are the same .",
    "however this does not imply ensemble equivalence : we have to study the stability of these extrema . + in order to discuss",
    "the stability of the canonical solution one has to determine the sign of the eigenvalues of the hessian of the function to be minimized in ( [ canoproblem ] ) .",
    "the hessian is @xmath137 where , for example , @xmath138 is the second derivative of @xmath139 with respect to @xmath93 .",
    "the extremum is a minimum if and only if the determinant and the trace of the hessian are positive @xmath140 which implies that @xmath141 and @xmath138 must be negative , and moreover @xmath142 .",
    "this has strong implications on the canonical specific heat , which must be positive .",
    "let us prove it using the variational approach , instead of the usual thirring argument  @xcite , that uses the expression of the canonical partition sum .",
    "indeed , taking the derivatives of eqs .",
    "( [ variational ] ) with respect to @xmath68 , after having substituted into them @xmath135 , one gets @xmath143 where it is understood that all second derivatives are computed at @xmath135 .",
    "recalling now that the specific heat per particle at constant volume is , @xmath144 one gets @xmath145 which is always positive if the stability conditions ( [ condstab ] ) are satisfied .",
    "however , since the stability condition in the microcanonical ensemble only requires that @xmath138 is negative , in order to have an entropy maximum , this indirectly proves that a canonically stable solution is also microcanonically stable .",
    "the converse is not true : one may well have an entropy maximum , @xmath146 , which is a free energy saddle point , with @xmath147 .",
    "this implies that the specific heat  ( [ cv ] ) can be negative .",
    "+ the above results are actually quite general , provided the canonical and microcanonical solutions are expressed through variational problems of the type ( [ canoproblem ] ) and ( [ microproblem ] ) .",
    "the extrema , and thus the caloric curves @xmath148 , are the same in the two ensembles , but the stability of the different branches is different ( see also the important paper by katz  @xcite and the contribution by chavanis to this book  @xcite for a discussion of this point in connection to self - gravitating systems ) .",
    "another example of this behavior is discussed for the hmf model in this book  @xcite .",

    "the first order reads @xmath216 in the microcanonical ensemble , where @xmath68 is a lagrange multiplier . in the canonical ensemble @xmath217 hence , the first order extremality conditions lead to the same equations for the two ensembles .",
    "however , this _ does not _ imply ensemble equivalence , since the stability of the solutions may differ in the two ensembles , as has been noted in section  [ section4 ] .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us briefly recall the results of ref .",
    "these authors , discussing the hamiltonian mean field model with slowly decaying interactions  @xcite , remarked that , choosing appropriately the renormalization factor in the hamiltonian , the thermodynamic behavior of the system turned out to be independent of @xmath218 ; i.e. the system behaves at @xmath219 ( slowly decaying case ) exactly as if @xmath3 ( mean - field case ) .",
    "an explanation of this result was provided by campa et al .",
    "@xcite through a canonical analysis of long - range interacting systems on lattices with periodic boundary conditions , and independently by vollmayr - lee and luijten  @xcite in a more general context .",
    "unfortunately , neither of the two latter methods provide the microcanonical solution .",
    "the method we present here is , instead , fully general and allows to discuss in detail how to extend the results for @xmath3 to @xmath220 .",
    "let us solve now the variational problem of eqs.([microorder1 ] ) and ( [ canoorder1 ] ) for the ising model  @xcite . the magnetization profile that extremizes",
    "entropy and free energy satisfies the following self - consistency condition @xmath221 in the canonical ensemble , @xmath68 is fixed , whereas in the microcanonical ensemble it has to be tuned in order to get the required energy . for periodic boundary conditions , the integral on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eqising ] ) does not depend on @xmath61 , and eq.([eqising ] ) always has a homogeneous solution with @xmath209 independent of @xmath61 .",
    "( [ eqising ] ) then reduces to the usual consistency equation of the mean - field ising model , and the system behaves exactly as in the @xmath3 case , showing a phase - transition in the canonical ensemble ( no transition is present in the microcanonical ensemble ) .    on the contrary , for free boundary conditions , there is no non - zero constant solution , and the system develops a non trivial magnetization profile that can be only numerically computed from eq.([eqising ] ) . moreover , in this case a phase transition is present in the canonical ensemble , while the microcanonical ensemble is always in a magnetically ordered phase . the magnetization profile in the microcanonical ensemble for free boundary conditions",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ profile ] for three different values of @xmath218 .",

    "the energy functional is @xmath228 where all is defined as before and , moreover , @xmath229 is the quadrupolar field in the continuum on the segment @xmath207 $ ] ( obtained in an analogous way as for the magnetization @xmath209 ) . the entropy functional of the beg model is obtained from expression  ( [ entropy1 ] ) by replacing @xmath230 by @xmath231 .",
    "the beg model is much richer , as has already been demonstrated for @xmath3 .",
    "the analysis of the microcanonical phase diagram for periodic boundary conditions follows the same path as that presented above for the ising model .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the constant profiles @xmath232 , @xmath233 , with @xmath234 and @xmath235 given by the solution of the @xmath3 model , are solutions of the eqs .",
    "( [ microorder1 ] ) and  ( [ canoorder1 ] ) ( where we replace the ising subscript by the beg one ) also for @xmath220 .",
    "moreover , detailed calculations  @xcite show that these solutions are local maxima of the entropy and local minima of the free energy .",
    "thus one concludes that for periodic systems the entropy and free energy are independent of @xmath218 and the conclusions reached for @xmath3 are valid for @xmath236 .",
    "in particular , ensemble inequivalence can be extended to the case of long - range algebraically decaying interactions .",
    "let us briefly sketch these calculations . to verify that uniform profiles are not destabilized by modulations , it is convenient to develop @xmath229 and @xmath209 in fourier series : @xmath237 , @xmath238 , where @xmath239 ranges from @xmath240 to @xmath241 and @xmath242 if @xmath243 , @xmath244 if @xmath245 .    the fourier representation , due to the periodicity , diagonalizes the hamiltonian .",
    "the energy may thus be written as @xmath246 here @xmath247 are the energy eigenvalues and @xmath248 is chosen such that the largest eigenvalue is unity @xmath249 ( this amounts to choose the prefactor @xmath250 in the kac prescription , see below ) .",
    "the free energy functional is @xmath251= \\epsilon-1/\\beta \\int s[q(x),m(x)]\\:dx~,\\ ] ] so that we get the first order conditions @xmath252u_k(x)\\:dx = 0 \\\\ & & -2\\beta { \\bar k}\\lambda_k\\tilde{m}_k-\\int s_m[q , m]u_k(x)\\:dx = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can easily check that the uniform profile @xmath253 , @xmath254 ( with @xmath255 and @xmath256 given by the @xmath3 case ) is indeed a solution of these conditions . to prove that the uniform profile is a free energy minimum , we evaluate now the hessian matrix at this point",
    "@xmath257 this infinite hessian matrix turns out to be positive definite . to prove this",
    ", it is sufficient to verify that each matrix @xmath258 @xmath259 is positive definite , when taken at the solution point .",
    "this follows easily from the fact that @xmath260 @xmath261 is positive definite ( because the point considered is the solution of the @xmath3 case ) , and recalling that @xmath262 for whatever @xmath239 .",
    "we have thus proved that the local stability of the uniform profiles at @xmath3 are not modified in the canonical ensemble when @xmath263 .",
    "all canonical @xmath148 curves shown in fig .",
    "[ tvse ] thus extend to the @xmath220 case .",
    "we now make use of the general discussion at the end of section [ section3 ] .",
    "we recall that results there derived state , in particular , that a stable canonical solution is always a stable microcanonical one , and that if one follows a @xmath148 curve , like in fig .",
    "[ tvse ] , a change of stability in the microcanonical ensemble may occur only where this curve has a vertical tangent ( see  @xcite and the contribution by chavanis  @xcite to this book ) . we thus conclude that the microcanonical part of fig .  [ tvse ] does not change either .",
    "this reasoning is however not rigorous , since we have considered only local stability ; it may happen that when @xmath263 , a heterogeneous solution appears and it could yield the true free energy minimum or entropy maximum .",
    "some numerical investigations we have carried out did not detect any such heterogeneous solution .",
    "we now turn to a different issue , namely the correspondence between the microscopic models and the continuum ones . in the following",
    "we show that the ising energy functional ( [ approxising ] ) can be derived by coarse graining from the microscopic ising hamiltonian with slowly decaying interactions @xmath264 where @xmath200 is the distance on a 1d lattice between spins at sites @xmath7 and @xmath199 .",
    "the interaction is _ non integrable _ for @xmath265 .",
    "the normalization @xmath266 ensures that the energy is extensive and the prefactor provides a convenient normalization for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in the case of periodic boundary conditions . to make the correspondence between continuous and microscopic models explicit",
    ", one has to set @xmath267 in eq .  [ approxising ] .",
    "analogously , the beg microscopic model we refer to is @xmath268    the coarse - graining procedure we present , closely follows ref .",
    "we will keep here a heuristic level of description , although all the following calculations can be made rigorous using the language and techniques of large deviation theory  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed account of this derivation is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first step involves a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "we divide the lattice in @xmath269 boxes , each one containing @xmath270 sites .",
    "we then describe macroscopically the system in the ising case by an average magnetization in each box , or , in the beg case , by the average @xmath93 and @xmath129 . in the limit @xmath271 , @xmath272 with @xmath273 , the system is then described by continuous functions @xmath231 , with @xmath274 $ ] if the system length is normalized .",
    "we have to show in the following that all the information lost in the coarse graining procedure is unessential .    in the mean - field case ( @xmath3 ) , the hamiltonian had a natural and exact expression as a function of the macroscopic parameters @xmath93 ( ising ) or @xmath93 and @xmath129 ( beg ) .",
    "the long - range ising case has already been discussed  @xcite and it has been shown that the intra - box couplings can be neglected in the thermodynamic limit , leading to the expression for the hamiltonian functional ( [ approxising ] ) and for the entropy ( [ entropy1ising ] ) as a function of the macroscopic parameter @xmath209 .",
    "the generalization to the beg model of the method applied in ref .",
    "@xcite is straightforward and allows one to obtain the hamiltonian functional ( [ approxbeg ] ) .",
    "the estimation is uniform over all the microscopic configurations  @xcite , and @xmath210 is the distance between the two boxes located in @xmath61 and @xmath211 . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath275 , there is no way to approximate the hamiltonian in the continuum limit described above as a functional of @xmath209 and @xmath229 .",
    "we show now how to construct the entropy functional for the ising model .",
    "its extension to the beg model is straightforward .",
    "we have to estimate the probability to obtain a certain given macroscopic configuration @xmath209 , assuming the equiprobability of microscopic configurations . for a finite number of boxes , @xmath269",
    ", we can evaluate the probability to get a given average magnetization in each box @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the entropy associated to the @xmath7-th box . letting @xmath270 and @xmath269",
    "go to infinity , we obtain @xmath278 \\simeq   e^{\\frac{n}{k_b}\\int_0 ^ 1 s(m(x))\\ : dx}~ , \\label{largedevising}\\ ] ] which defines the entropy functional @xmath279 of the ising model .",
    "let us remark again that large deviation techniques  @xcite give a precise and rigorous meaning to these calculations , and allow one to extend this type of derivation to all sort of lattice models .",
    "the field @xmath229 of the beg model can be treated in a similar way as @xmath209 and one gets the beg entropy functional similarly .",
    "chavanis  @xcite and , cohen and ispolatov  @xcite analyze in this book more realistic off - lattice systems , self - gravitating or interacting through a @xmath280 potential ( @xmath281 ) .",
    "they study the thermodynamic properties of these models through a mean - field approximation , and the phenomenology is pretty much the same as the one decribed here .",
    "unfortunately , to see the analogies , one must cope with discrepancies in the  vocabulary \" .",
    "for instance , the _ microcanonical first order _",
    "transition described here is called _ gravitational first order _ transition , whereas the _ canonical first order _ one is called _ normal first order _ transition . within the conventions of this paper one",
    "can see that , varying a control parameter ( the interaction @xmath282 for the beg model , and a parameter controlling the short range cut - off in gravitational models ) the system crosses over from a microcanonical first order transition to a microcanonical second order one ( or no transition at all in the gravitational systems ) associated with a canonical first order , and then recovers full ensemble equivalence , crossing the critical point .",
    "all these off - lattices studies raise the question of the validity of the mean - field approximation , which is intimately related to the scaling with @xmath8 of the thermodynamic variables and potentials . in our case ,",
    "the mean field treatment is fully valid in the thermodynamic limit , but the problem was avoided using the physically unjustified kac prescription  @xcite in which the coupling constants are rescaled by @xmath250 .",
    "in this paper a detailed comparison is made between the canonical and the microcanonical phase diagrams of the spin-1 beg model with mean field long range interactions . since systems with long range interactions , and particularly mean field models , are non - additive the two ensembles need not be equivalent .",
    "the beg model , for which both phase diagrams can be evaluated analytically , provides a convenient and interesting ground for studying the distinctions between the two ensembles .",
    "although the model is rather simple , it exhibits a non - trivial phase diagram , which in the canonical ensemble consists of both a first order and a second order transition lines separated by a tricritical point .",
    "it is shown that the microcanonical phase diagram , while it yields the same thermodynamic behavior in the region where the canonical transition is second order , it differs considerably from the canonical one in the region where the transition is first order .",
    "in particular it exhibits a region with a negative specific heat , a tricritical point whose location differs from that of the canonical ensemble , and a first order line at which the two coexisting phases have different temperatures .",
    "the mechanisms which lead to these features are rather general , and thus they are expected to take place in other models with long range interactions within the microcanonical ensemble ( see also  @xcite ) .    a straightforward generalization of these results to models with algebraically decaying interactions are considered .",
    "it is shown that the mean field phase diagram remains valid even for these interactions , as long as they are long range .",
    "it would be of great interest to extend this study in the future and to analyze and compare canonical and microcanonical phase diagrams in more complex cases , where higher order multicritical points are present .",
    "such studies may eventually lead to general rules which should be obeyed by microcanonical phase diagrams of systems with long range interactions , in analogy to the rules existing for systems with short range interactions , like the gibbs phase rules , the landau and lifshitz symmetry rules for continuous transitions and others .",
