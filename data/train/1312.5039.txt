    "ae aquarii ( hereafter ae  aqr ) is a cataclysmic variable binary system classified as a member of the dq herculis or intermediate polar ( ip ) class @xcite .",
    "it is a non - eclipsing close binary system at a distance of @xmath10  pc @xcite , consisting of a magnetic white dwarf ( primary ) and a k45 v star ( secondary ) with an orbital period , @xmath11  hour .",
    "the 33.08  s period makes ae aqr the fastest - spinning magnetic white dwarf .",
    "the pulsations were originally discovered in the optical @xcite , then confirmed in soft x - rays @xcite and the ultraviolet @xcite . in the dq herculis class , the white dwarf is generally thought to possess a magnetic field ( @xmath12  g ) strong enough to channel the accretion flow from the secondary to the poles of the white dwarf .",
    "accordingly , hard x - rays are produced by the shock - heated gas , which reaches temperatures of a few tens of kev near the surface . the white dwarf photosphere , heated by the hard x - rays , emits ultraviolet light .",
    "these emissions exhibit spin modulation caused by the varying aspect of the accreting poles as the white dwarf rotates ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "ae  aqr stands out as an unusual member of the dq herculis class .",
    "it displays strong flares of broad - band emission , from radio to x - rays .",
    "in addition , possible tev @xmath13-ray flares have been reported @xcite , although they have not yet been confirmed with more recent tev cerenkov telescopes @xcite .",
    "the persistent x - ray luminosity of ae  aqr ( @xmath14  erg  s@xmath2 ) is two orders of magnitude lower than that of typical ips .",
    "its x - ray spectrum has been modeled as emission from an optically thin thermal plasma with several temperature components , similar to those seen from other ips .",
    "however , the highest temperature found in such models was 4.6  kev @xcite , which is significantly lower than the average @xmath15  kev found in the 22 ips detected by _ integral _  @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , the mechanism and location of the x - ray emission are still uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "another intriguing feature reported by a _ suzaku _  observation in 2005 is that ae  aqr may emit non - thermal hard x - rays with a very narrow pulse profile at the spin period @xcite , suggesting that ae  aqr may accelerate charged particles in a fashion similar to rotation - powered pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , the _ suzaku _  observation in 2006 did not reproduce the earlier result , leaving the detection of non - thermal x - rays from ae  aqr uncertain .    in this paper",

    "in fact , _ xmm - newton _  spectra constrained the upper limit to the 6.4  kev equivalent width to be @xmath56  ev @xcite .",
    "we tried to add a narrow gaussian emission model with a center energy fixed at 6.4  kev to the three - temperature apec model , and simultaneously fit the spectra of _ swift _  and _ nustar _  with it .",

    "the derived power - law index , @xmath84 , is also inconsistent with the _ suzaku _  value , @xmath85 , and is steeper than those found for rotation - powered pulsars , which range from 0.6 to 2.1 @xcite .",
    "here we note that the previously reported _ suzaku _  fitting errors did not include the systematic uncertainty of the _ suzaku_/hxd - pin background model because the authors described that the hard x - ray flux was consistent with the narrow pulse flux in the spin profile .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainty , 3% @xcite , is comparable to the background - subtracted count rate , and therefore should not be ignored ( see figures  6 and 7 of @xcite for comparison of the rates ) .",

    "would have been capable of significantly detecting the narrow pulsation .    a possible explanation of the difference between the _ suzaku_and _ nustar",

    "it is difficult to explain a mechanism only in hard x - rays that would make the flux vary without correlation of thermal soft x - rays , a part of which also modulates with the spin period .",
    "two energy sources could , in principle , power the observed x - ray luminosity @xmath90  erg  s@xmath2 : liberation of gravitational energy of accreting matter and the rotational energy of the white dwarf .",
    "the white dwarf was reported to spin down with a rate @xmath91  s  s@xmath2 @xcite , which corresponds to spindown power @xmath92  erg  s@xmath93 .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the x - ray emission of the white dwarf is fed by rotation @xcite . the rotation - induced electric field could accelerate particles to high lorentz factors",
    "if the magnetosphere is plasma - starved and the electric field is not screened . synchrotron emission was suggested as a possible radiative mechanism in such a model @xcite .",
    "it is , however , unclear how the observed luminosity , spectrum , and pulse profile observed by _",
    "nustar _  would be produced by relativistic particles .",
    "the efficiency of synchrotron emission is expected to be small , since the particles are accelerated along the magnetic field lines . emission from accelerated particles is also expected to be strongly beamed along the field lines , which is inconsistent with the observed broad pulse profile in figure  [ fig : prof ] .",
    "emission powered by accretion is a plausible mechanism .",
    "the standard model of accreting ips involves an accretion column heated by the accretion shock and cooled by thermal bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "it explains well the x - ray spectra of many ips ( see @xcite for _ ginga _  data , for _ rxte _ , @xcite for _ swift_/xrt and _ integral_/ibis , for _",
    "swift_/bat , and for _ suzaku _ ) .",
    "the main parameters of the model are the free - fall velocity @xmath94 and the accretion rate per unit area , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the fraction of the white dwarf surface occupied by the accretion column .",

    "this scenario would imply @xmath104  g  s@xmath2 for ae  aqr , and the condition @xmath105  g  s@xmath2  @xmath36 is satisfied if @xmath106 .",
    "such a small @xmath96 may be possible if , e.g. , the accretion flow in ae  aqr is concentrated in a thin wall of the accretion column ( as @xcite suggested for accreting neutron stars ) .",

    "the shallower gravitational potential at the high altitude results in a reduction of the postshock temperature below 20  kev typical of other ips .",

    "telescope @xcite ( 2 ) the x - ray spectrum emitted by the accretion column could be affected by additional radiative losses due to cyclotron emission in the infrared band .",
    "cyclotron emission is important when @xmath110  g , and may carry away a significant part of the accretion column energy , especially at large altitudes where the plasma has the highest temperature .",
    "this effect could explain the relatively soft extended spectrum of ae  aqr above 3  kev .",
    "detailed calculations of such models will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in addition to the low x - ray luminosity and soft spectrum , ae  aqr has another special feature  weak absorption of soft x - rays , which corresponds to @xmath111  @xmath36 , lower than the @xmath112  @xmath36 observed in many ips .",
    "this feature could be explained by the lower density of the accretion column , and needs to be further investigated with detailed models .",
    "also note that ae  aqr does not show evidence for a neutral ( or weakly ionized ) iron line .",
    "among other ips previously studied in the hard x - ray band , ex  hydrae has the lowest luminosity @xmath113  erg  s@xmath2 and also the lowest column with @xmath114  @xmath36 .",
    "the shape of its 3 - 30  kev spectrum is not far from that of ae  aqr , although ex  hydrae is a nearly synchronous system with an orbital period of 98.3  min and a long spin period of 67.0  min @xcite , unlike ae  aqr .    the much smaller accretion rate of ae  aqr compared to many other ips is thought to be due to the magnetic propeller effect @xcite , whereby most of the mass lost by the secondary is being flung out of the binary by the magnetic field of the rapidly rotating white dwarf . @xcite",
    "performed numerical simulations of accretion flows in magnetic cataclysmic variables with wide ranges of magnetic moment , @xmath115  g  @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "they demonstrated that ips with a very small ratio of @xmath118 like ae  aqr ( @xmath119 ) show magnetic propeller effects .",
    "therefore , the tall accretion column could be formed in ips with @xmath120 , though such systems would also be expected to have low x - ray luminosities , thus making them more challenging to identify .",
    "ae  aqr is the only currently known example .",
    "it is also possible that nearly synchronous systems similar to ex  hydrae could possess a tall accretion column .",
    "the low accretion rate in such systems is consistent with the picture of ring - like accretion discussed by @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed x - ray data of the magnetized white dwarf ae  aqr observed with _ nustar _  for 125  ks and _ swift _  for 1.5  ks .",
    "the 0.530 kev spectra are well characterized by either an optically thin thermal plasma model with three temperatures with the highest temperature of @xmath5  kev , or an optically thin thermal plasma model with two temperatures plus a power - law component with photon index of @xmath8 .",
    "the 320  kev pulse profile shows a sinusoidal modulation , with a pulsed fraction of @xmath9% .",
