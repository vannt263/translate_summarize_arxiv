    "recent phenix results on @xmath0 production in pp , da , and aa collisions at rhic provide a first opportunity to test for the presence of in - medium formation , which is expected to become significant when multiple pairs of heavy quarks are present in a single aa collision @xcite .",
    "preliminary results @xcite for @xmath1 as a function of centrality show less suppression than expected in several model calculations , but can be reproduced by revised models in which the initially - produced @xmath0 are almost completely suppressed , and are then augmented by an additional component which can be attributed to in - medium formation . however the precise magnitude of in - medium formation is in general sensitive to several model parameters which are not at present well - constrained from independent measurements .",
    "an alternative scenario asserts that there is no dissociation of primary @xmath0 even at rhic energy @xcite .",
    "thus one must await results at lhc energy to test the sequential suppression scenario using only the magnitude of @xmath0 production .",
    "our recent work in this area concentrated on finding a signature for in - medium @xmath0 formation which is independent of the detailed dynamics and magnitude of the formation .",
    "we found that the _ normalized _ spectrum of the formed @xmath0 may provide such a signature @xcite , because the spectrum of @xmath0 formed in - medium is closely correlated with the spectrum of @xmath2 pairs from which they are formed .",
    "the difference between @xmath0 formed in - medium and those which are produced in the initial stages is due to the combined effect of ( a ) different properties of the  off - diagonal \" pairs compared with the  diagonal pairs \" , and ( b ) inclusion of a formation probability which characterizes the in - medium process .",
    "the virtue of this approach is that we do not require a knowledge of the absolute magnitude of in - medium formation in order to isolate the signatures .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the properties of a generic kinetic model for in - medium recombination and the resulting formalism to calculate normalized spectra .",
    "we calculate the initial charm quark spectra using nlo pqcd amplitudes , adjusted for initial state broadening in aa collisions .",
    "this is appropriate in the case where the interaction between charm quarks and the medium is negligible .",
    "we find that the resulting @xmath0 spectra are quite distinct from that of the initial state diagonal pair sample .",
    "the following section exhibits the model calculations of normalized spectra .",
    "more recent work on the centrality behavior of these spectra is presented in the next section , along with a comparison with preliminary phenix measurements .",
    "a brief summary completes this presentation .",
    "we calculate the net number of @xmath0 produced in a color - deconfined medium due to the competing reactions of ( a ) in - medium formation involving recombination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and ( b ) dissociation of @xmath0 induced by interactions with the medium .",
    "the simplest dissociation reaction utilizes absorption of single deconfined gluons in the medium to ionize the color singlet @xmath0 , @xmath5 , resulting in a @xmath2 pair in a color octet state .",
    "the inverse of this process then serves as the corresponding formation reaction , in which a @xmath2 pair in a color octet state emits a color octet gluon and falls into the color singlet @xmath0 bound state . of course",
    ", any dissociation mechanism will have a corresponding in - medium formation mechanism involving the time - reversed reaction , but the relative magnitudes will depend on the momentum distribution of the initial state participants .",
    "one can then follow the time evolution of charm quark and charmonium numbers according to a boltzmann equation in which the formation and dissociation reactions compete .",

    "the reactivity @xmath8 is the product of the reaction cross section and initial relative velocity @xmath9 averaged over the momentum distribution of the initial participants , i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath0 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the gluon density is determined by the equilibrium value in the medium at each temperature , and the volume must be modeled according to the expansion and cooling profiles of the heavy ion interaction region .",
    "[ formationintegral ] has an analytic solution in the case where the total number of formed @xmath0 is much smaller than the initial number of @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15^{-1}\\ , dt } ] , \\label{eqbeta}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 define the lifetime of the deconfined region .",
    "note that the function @xmath18 would be the suppression factor in this scenario if the formation mechanism were neglected .",
    "one sees that the second term , quadratic in @xmath14 , is precisely the total number of recombinations which occur in the deconfinement volume , modified by the factor @xmath19 , which is just the suppression factor for @xmath0 formed between times @xmath20 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is obvious that a prediction of total initial plus in - medium formation population depends on many parameters , not all of which are constrained by independent information .",
    "certainly the number of @xmath2 pairs in the region of color deconfinement sets an important overall scale and centrality dependence .",
    "there are measurements by star @xcite and phenix @xcite of these quantities , which at present have uncertainties in the factor of 2 range .",
    "at least as significant is the variation of @xmath21 for different charm quark momentum distributions .",
    "we find that this quantity decreases by a factor of approximately five when the distribution changes between thermal equilibrium and that predicted by initial production as calculated in pqcd .",
    "in addition , one needs to model the geometric properties of the region of color deconfinement , including the centrality dependence and accounting for the expansion profile .",
    "an initial temperature @xmath22 controls the dissociation rate , and also the time evolution of the geometry .",
    "another parameter ( x ) specifies the initial number of @xmath0 produced in normal nucleon - nucleon interactions as a fraction of @xmath14 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ initialphenixdata ] the initial phenix data @xcite , which consisted of measurements of @xmath23 at central rapidity in three centrality intervals . within limited statistics ,",
    "it is evident that there is suppression below even binary scaling .",
    "however , the flexibility of this model is quite substantial , as shown in fig .",
    "[ parameterspaceconstraint ] .",
    "the most recent phenix data for @xmath0 production in au - au interactions at 200 @xmath24 is presented in terms of , in which the normalizing factor is the equivalent binary - scaled @xmath0 yield from a superposition of pp collisions .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ kineticraapredictions ] predictions of the kinetic model using the parameter set as shown in fig [ initialphenixdata ] .",
    "our model calculations are limited to normalized spectra , so that predictions for @xmath1 are uncertain up to an overall magnitude . for purposes of comparison with data , we normalize to unity at the most peripheral @xmath25 .",
    "one sees that the suppression of initially - produced @xmath0 is almost complete , which is controlled by the initial temperature parameter @xmath22 = 0.5 @xmath24 in this case .",
    "inclusion of the in - medium contribution is seen to be generally consistent with the data within present uncertainties .",
    "for contrast , we insert in fig .",
    "[ noformationraa ] the model predictions without in - medium formation , using a much lower @xmath22 = 0.35 @xmath24 .",
    "one sees that this scenario is also roughly consistent with the data .",
    "thus we are in a situation where one needs additional input on an  expected \" baseline which contains no in - medium formation , in order to make a clear case for its presence or absence .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath0 momentum spectra are also measured , and they contain independent signatures with which to compare .",
    "we present here a brief overview of the method used to extract these spectra .",
    "the details are contained in ref .",
    "the starting point is a version of eq .",
    "[ formationintegral ] which is differential in @xmath0 momentum . for the in - medium formation contribution , one obtains    @xmath26    where the sum over all @xmath2 pairs incorporates the total formation reactivity .",
    "since we are only interested in the normalized spectra , the overall magnitude factors which proved to be extremely sensitive to model parameters can be disregarded .",
    "we just calculate the relative formation probability using a model cross section and evaluate the relative formation rates from each pair .",
    "the quark momentum distributions were obtained by generating a sample of @xmath2 pairs directly from nlo pqcd amplitudes .",
    "fortunately , we find that the resulting normalized spectra are quite insensitive to the details of the formation cross section .",
    "in addition , we have shown @xcite that final state dissociation effects have a negligible effect on the normalized formation spectra .",
    "the key signature is generated by utilizing appropriate subsets of the @xmath2 pairs .",
    "for no in - medium formation , we include only the  diagonal \" pairs , i.e. those which were generated in the same parton - parton interaction from pqcd amplitudes . in this case",
    "we employ a color - evaporation type of scenario , in which the relative probability of hadronization into a @xmath0 is independent of the quark pair momentum . for the in - medium formation , we include also the  off - diagonal \" pairs , in which a charm quark from one interaction forms the @xmath0 by combining with an anticharm quark which was produced in a different pqcd interaction . thus the difference between @xmath0 spectra with and without in - medium formation arises from a combination of two effects : the different pair momentum distributions of the diagonal vs. off - diagonal pair sample , and the inclusion of a formation probability for the formation reaction in the medium .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ cquarkpt ] and fig .",
    "[ cquarky ] .",
    "the effect of in - medium formation on the rapidity spectra is quite simple .",
    "the dominant factor comes from the weighting of the @xmath2 pairs by the formation probability , which has previously been shown to predict a narrowing of the rapidity distribution .",
    "initial phenix data @xcite is now available , and does not show any evidence for narrowing of the spectra .",
    "however , the uncertainties are still quite large , so that a definitive statement can not be made at this time . for now , we proceed with a detailed analysis of the transverse momentum spectra .",
    "the charm quark spectra we calculate from pqcd have used collinear parton interactions only . to simulate the effects of confinement in nucleons , and more importantly the initial state broadening due to multiple scattering of nucleons",
    ", we have supplemented the quark pair distributions by adding a transverse momentum kick to each quark in a diagonal pair , chosen from a gaussian distribution with width characterized by @xmath28 .",
    "this effect is magnified in the difference between diagonal and off - diagonal pairs .",
    "since the azimuthal direction of the @xmath29 is uncorrelated from pair - to - pair , an off - diagonal pair with initial @xmath27 will increase to @xmath30 .",
    "however , the azimuthal correlation inherent in the diagonal pair will result in an increase to @xmath31 . this effect will be evident when we consider the centrality dependence of spectra .",
    "we next use reference data @xcite on @xmath0 production in pp and d - au interactions to determine some of these parameters .",
    "a fit to the dimuon data spectra fixes @xmath32 .",
    "we determine the initial state nuclear broadening with a standard random walk picture .",
    "@xmath33 ,   \\label{papt}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the average number of inelastic interactions of the projectile proton as it traverses the nucleus a , and @xmath35 is proportional to the square of the transverse momentum transfer per collision . for a nucleus - nucleus collision ,",
    "the corresponding relation is @xmath36 .",
    "\\label{aapt}\\ ] ] we now update the determination of the parameter @xmath35 from that in ref . @xcite .",
    "this update uses a woods - saxon nuclear density parameterization , rather than the sharp sphere model used previously .",
    "we should note that @xmath37 and @xmath35 are correlated within a given nuclear geometry .",
    "we use the published @xcite @xmath38 and the average of @xmath39 and @xmath40 and calculate @xmath41 for minimum bias d - au interactions at rhic energy ( using @xmath42 = 42 mb ) , to extract @xmath43 . given this parameter ,",
    "one can use calculated values of @xmath44 as a function of centrality to predict @xmath27 for the @xmath0 which originate from initially - produced diagonal @xmath2 pairs .",
    "an extension of this procedure is then used to predict @xmath27 as a function of centrality for the @xmath0 which originate from in - medium formation .",
    "here there are two effects which contribute .",
    "one involves the same ( centrality - dependent ) intrinsic @xmath28 due to initial state effects in aa interactions , but which now enters with a different numerical coefficient for off - diagonal pairs .",
    "the other follows the @xmath27 of the in - medium formation process , which has its own characteristic dependence on this same @xmath28 .",
    "results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ directvsformationpt2 ] .",
    "the centrality measure is parameterized by the number of binary collisions , also calculated in the glauber formalism using the woods - saxon density parameterization .",
    "the stars and dashed bars indicate the central value of the model predictions for the two scenarios .",
    "one sees clearly that the centrality dependence of @xmath27 is significantly different for the @xmath0 produced initially as compared with those which were formed in - medium .",
    "thus measurements in very central collisions will have an enhanced ability to differentiate between these two mechanisms of @xmath0 production .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the uncertainty in the model calculations , primarily due to the value of the parameter @xmath35 determined from the broadening in dau interactions , but also including the uncertainty in the measured @xmath27 in pp interactions .",
    "the preliminary phenix data @xcite for @xmath27 is also shown in fig .",
    "[ directvsformationpt2 ] for three centrality intervals , spanning 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% , and 40 - 90% .",
    "although the experimental uncertainties make a definitive conclusion difficult , it appears that the in - medium formation predictions may be somewhat more consistent with the data .",
    "unfortunately the most central point for the forward rapidity region is not available , but a corresponding measurement for backward rapidity may be forthcoming .",
    "measurements in the central rapidity interval and the forward rapidity interval appear to differ in the 20 - 40% centrality interval , which would be difficult to interpret in terms of the initial production vs. in - medium formation scenario we have presented .",
    "however , the model calculations have been performed over the entire rapidity region , and thus one can look for differences within the experimental rapidity intervals . fig .",
    "[ ybindiagonalccbar ] shows that this variation for the diagonal @xmath2 pairs is much smaller than that for the measurements , and fig .",
    "[ ybinformation ] exhibits the same situation for the in - medium formation scenario .",
    "thus for a definitive conclusion to be reached in this model comparison , one will require not only a decreased experimental uncertainty in the measured @xmath27 , but will require that either the dependence on rapidity interval must essentially disappear , or that some rapidity - dependent final state effect dominates the spectra .",
    "we have shown that the width of @xmath0  spectra in aa interactions can differentiate between initial production and in - medium formation via pqcd charm quarks . at large centrality , one requires only a measurement of @xmath27 with less than approximately 20% uncertainty .",
    "the present differences between spectra using measurements at central and forward rapidity are puzzling within this framework .",
    "the corresponding spectra for in - medium formation using thermal charm quark distributions , as well as direct hadronization of @xmath0 with a thermal distribution @xcite result in @xmath27 substantially smaller than either the preliminary data or the two model results presented here .",
    "it remains to be seen if a combination of such production processes can be made consistent with the data .",
