    "considerable progress has been made in understanding of the static @xcite and dynamic @xcite behavior of polymer chains in a quenched random medium .",
    "it was shown already in the paper by cates and ball @xcite that for sufficiently large diffusion coefficient ( so as the chain may sample the whole system ) the quenched and annealed problems are equivalent .",
    "indeed , since the chain always moves towards the deepest energy minimum , quenched and annealed problems can differ only for finite volume of the random medium@xcite .    in a recent publication @xcite we have argued that dynamic aspects can significantly affect the problem in question .",
    "we have treated this problem@xcite using the generating functional method which based on the langevin dynamics . within this method",
    "the averaging over the quenched disorder leads to coupling between different dynamic trajectories which in turn eventually results in a non - markovian diffusional slowing down , i.e.in anomalous diffusion , as well as in non - ergodic behavior for the rouse modes of the polymer chain .",
    "the resulting equation of motion ( which was derived within the hartree approximation ) has a memory kernel typical for the mode - coupling theory of the glass transition @xcite .",
    "self - consistent treatment of this equation leads to the conclusion that in @xmath12 - dimensional space the center of mass diffusion coefficient decreases according to the law : @xmath13\\quad ,   \\label{diffusion}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the dispersion of the disorder potential , @xmath14 is the kuhn segment length , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the flory exponent ) .",
    "this differs remarkably from the earlier prediction , @xmath17 $ ] , based on a simple markovian diffusion argumentation @xcite . as a result",
    "some critical disorder , @xmath18 , exist such that at @xmath19 the chain center of mass is arrested by the random potential . in the case when the capture time @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the time of internal degrees of freedom equilibration ) the quenched and annealed problems are not equivalent even for an infinite volume ! rouse modes of the chain also freeze at a common disorder strength @xmath2 , so that the non - ergodicity plateau shows up according the a - type ( or continuous ) transition @xcite . in the present letter we will mainly check these important predictions of the ref.@xcite by the direct and vast mc - simulations . in the conclusion",
    "we also sketch some possible future developments .",
    "in the present study we employ an off - lattice monte carlo model of a bead - spring polymer chain , used in numerous investigations before@xcite . during the simulation beads",
    "are chosen at random and displaced to a new trial position in their environment subject to a metropolis procedure .",
    "each polymer chain consists of @xmath1 beads , connected by anharmonic springs which are described by the finitely - extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential@xcite    @xmath22 ,   \\label{fene}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the bond length which can vary in between @xmath24 and has the equilibrium value @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the spring constant . as beforeamkb",
    ", we take @xmath28 as the unit length , @xmath29 and @xmath30 the non - bonded interactions between the beads are described by the morse potential@xcite    @xmath31 -\\exp \\left [ -a \\left ( r - r_{\\min } \\right ) \\right ] , \\label{morse}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the distance between the beads , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( since the potential has a very short range , the simulation code is rather fast@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath35-temperature for the model is @xmath36 so that at @xmath37 , used throughout in this study , the chain is in a good solvent regime and all energetic variables are dimensionless .    the energetic disorder is created by dividing the simulation box into @xmath38 hypothetical subcells , each of size @xmath39 , which are ascribed a gaussian - distributed local potential so that its dispersion is taken as a measure of the degree of disorder @xmath2",
    ". typically runs of length @xmath40 mc steps ( mcs ) have been carried out and observables have been averaged over @xmath41 different realizations of disorder .",
    "first of all we emphasize that the stochastic dynamics in the system under study is _ not _ time translational invariant ( tti ) @xcite .",
    "this means that in the time - dependent correlation function one should keep control on two times : the waiting time @xmath42 , i.e. the time elapsed after the system preparation ( aging ) before any measurement starts , and the actual measurement time @xmath43 . with this in mind",
    "we have studied the center of mass mean - square displacement ( msqd ) @xmath44 ^",
    "2\\rangle \\quad,\\ ] ] where the center of mass position @xmath45 and the angular brackets denote an average over the realizations of disorder .",
    "in contrast , in cases of vanishing disorder tti holds and the time correlation functions depend on a single variable @xmath46 .",
    "fig.[msd ] shows a typical example for the chain length @xmath47 the disorder strength @xmath48 and the mc - time interval @xmath49 .",
    "one can clearly distinguish three diffusional regimes . in the initial short interval @xmath50 a relatively fast normal diffusion shows up .",
    "the crossover time @xmath3 corresponds to the moment when disorder starts to effect the chain motion . in ref.@xcite",
    "this moment was denoted by @xmath51 and was defined as the point where the memory - friction term overwhelms the bare - friction term .",
    "after that the non - markovian diffusion gets under way . in the interval @xmath52 the msqd manifests itself as anomalous diffusion with @xmath53 , where the exponent @xmath54 . at time @xmath55 ( which corresponds to the msqd @xmath56 ) the diffusion goes back to normal albeit with a significant slowing down ( see below ) .",
    "the msqd - plot given in fig.[msd ] has been obtained for waiting time @xmath57 . in the present report",
    "we shall not consider aging phenomena ( i.e. the @xmath42 - dependence of the time correlation functions as well as the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) ) putting this off for a later publication .",
    "nevertheless fig.[drift ] clearly demonstrates the drift of the full energy @xmath58 with time @xmath43 which for @xmath59 gets pronounced at @xmath60 .    evidently in this case",
    "the tti is violated for larger disorder .",
    "the age of the system also influences static conformational properties as the mean - squared radius of gyration @xmath61 of the polymer chain .",
    "figure [ radius ] shows that at small disorder , @xmath62 , the @xmath61 versus @xmath1 dependence has the same slope as in the pure ( i.e. without any disorder ) system .",
    "an inspection of the measured @xmath61 vs. @xmath1 relationship yields @xmath63 for the flory exponent . at large disorder ,",
    "@xmath64 , however , the slope of @xmath65 is affected by the waiting time @xmath42 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 which we have used in fig.[radius ] corresponds to the slow diffusion regime , i.e. @xmath66 . in this case",
    "@xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 which is consistent with the results obtained on hierarchical lattices @xcite for the quenched problem .",
    "the quenched problem in ref.@xcite corresponds to the case in which the one end of the chain is kept fixed . in this case the polymer stretches away from the fixed end in order to find a region with a minimal energy .",
    "the imry - ma arguments have been used in ref @xcite to show that @xmath69 .",
    "now we go back to msqd - plot ( fig.[msd ] ) to discuss how the crossover times , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , depend on @xmath2 .",
    "this is presented in fig.[crossover ]    the first crossover @xmath3 decreases whereas the second one @xmath5 increases with the disorder strength @xmath2 , so that the anomalous diffusion interval is extended .",
    "while for the relatively long chains , @xmath70 , the initial interval @xmath3 is getting progressively so short that a scaling dependence on @xmath2 is difficult to establish , for shorter chains ( where the statistics is better too ) the @xmath3 vs @xmath2 relationship can be reasonably fitted by @xmath4 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a theoretical prediction for @xmath3 was derived as : @xmath71 where the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath72 . in the case of @xmath73 and @xmath74 one",
    "obtains @xmath75 which leads to @xmath76 .",
    "this prediction agrees closely with the above - mentioned mc findings . as is clearly seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ crossover ] , all data for the second crossover time @xmath5 follow a scaling law @xmath77 where @xmath7 is some scaling function .",
    "as mentioned above , at @xmath55 the normal diffusion regime shows a significant slowing down .",
    "this extremely important result is depicted in fig.[slow ] over a wide range of chain lengths .",
    "all points in the reduced coordinates ( @xmath78 vs @xmath79 ) lie on a single master curve .",
    "it appears that our mc - data nicely follows the best fit @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 ) which correlates well with the theoretical predictions for @xmath8 ( see eq.([diffusion ] ) ) .",
    "a remarkable and strong systematic difference between the master curve ( solid line ) and the simple markovian diffusion result ( dashed line ) can be seen , which grows progressively with increasing of degree of disorder .",
    "the basis for this slowing down is the coupling between diffusional trajectories ( or between different parts of the same trajectory ) caused by the averaging over the disorder .",
    "this furnishes the non - markovian slowing down regime , which mathematically shows up as a memory kernel term in the resulting equation of motion @xcite .",
    "such behavior is generic for the `` schematic '' mode - coupling theory of the glass transition @xcite .",
    "the existence of such dynamic singularity for a finite chain is in principle questionable .",
    "more precisely one should better mean that the capture time of the center of mass , @xmath82 , is finite albeit astronomical , so that in the slowing down regime @xmath83 .",
    "this time scale goes beyond the scope of our present mc - simulation .",
    "so far , we have focused mainly on the chain center of mass slow dynamics .",
    "we studied also the time dependent correlation function of the rouse modes @xcite @xmath84 where the rouse mode component with an index @xmath85 , @xmath86 $ ] , is measured at time @xmath43 .",
    "this correlation function reflects the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rouse_correlator ] that at relatively large disorder strength @xmath2 a characteristic plateau appears which is reminiscent of a non - ergodic behavior for the so called @xmath87 - type dynamical transition @xcite .",
    "figure [ rouse_correlator ] illustrates this non - ergodic plateau behavior for the first mode ( @xmath88 ) and the chain length @xmath89 .",
    "the hight @xmath90 of the plateau is found to be a continuous function of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath91 , which qualitatively agrees with the recent theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the critical @xmath92 coincides with the critical value @xmath93 which is obtained for @xmath89 from the diffusion results ( see the fig.[slow ] ) . the well - known @xmath94 model , which has been studied in ref.@xcite , provides a simple example of such kind of continuous transition .",
    "in this work an off - lattice model of a self - avoiding polymer chain in quenched random field is used to study the slow polymer dynamics .",
    "we examine the center of mass msqd at different degree of disorder and find a broad regime of anomalous diffusion which starts at a crossover time @xmath3 and ends at a second crossover @xmath5 by going into normal diffusion regime .",
    "we have demonstrated that these crossover times are observed to scale in agreement with the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath95 at @xmath55 drops dramatically at a critical value @xmath96 .",
    "simulation data for @xmath8 of different polymer chain length and different degree of disorder is observed to collapse on a single master curve as predicted in a recent theory @xcite .",
    "this significant slowing down effectively originates from the coupling between different dynamic trajectories of a polymer chain caused by the averaging over many disorder realizations .",
    "the hartree approximation which has been used in @xcite is close in spirit to the well- known mode - coupling approximation @xcite and provides the basis for the treatment of non - markovian regimes .",
    "in contrast , a treatment in terms of markovian arguments yields an exponential relationship between diffusion coefficient and reduced disorder which proves to be inadequate .",
    "the same reasons bring about the rouse modes freezing at a common disorder strength @xmath93 , whereby the generic non - ergodicity plateau appears continuously .",
    "this is also in line with the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "finally we should stress that the system at issue does not satisfy tti so that the waiting time @xmath42 is a very important parameter .",
    "although @xmath97 has been controlled in the calculation of msqd ( eq.([displacement ] ) ) and the rouse mode correlators , eq.([rouse ] ) , its impact on the dynamics is to be reported in a following communication . to this end the generating functional approach , which has been used in ref.@xcite , should be generalized to the out - of - equilibrium dynamics @xcite where the influence of @xmath42 ( or the aging ) and fdt violation are the effects of a primary interest .",
    "we plan to consider these problems in a future publication .",
