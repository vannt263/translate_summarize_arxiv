    "the discovery of exoplanets has provided an exciting opportunity to test our theories of planet formation and evolution .",
    "the detection of the first hot jupiter by @xcite made planetary migration become a central ingredient of these theories @xcite .",
    "planetary migration occurs from the early stages of planet formation , as planets tidally interact with the protoplanetary disk where they are embedded in @xcite .",
    "planets experience a torque from the disk that alters their eccentricity and semi - major axis .",
    "the variation of the planets semi - major axis under the disk torque is referred to as planetary migration .",
    "depending on the disk and planet properties , three types of migration are usually distinguished .",
    "type i migration applies to low - mass planets , typically up to a few earth masses if the central object has a solar mass . in isothermal disks ,",
    "type i migration is directed inwards and is much faster than both the formation of giant planets cores and the disk evaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to reproduce the mass - distance distribution of the observed exoplanets",
    ", population synthesis models have shown that type i migration should be significantly slowed down @xcite , and that processes stalling migration should be at work , in particular near the snow line @xcite .",
    "some mechanisms recently proposed to slow down , halt or even reverse migration are reviewed below .",
    "type ii migration concerns planets that are massive enough to open up a clean gap around their orbit ( typically jupiter - mass planets ) . in this regime ,",
    "planets drift inwards at the disk viscous rate @xcite",
    ". intermediate - mass planets building up a partial gap can undergo a runaway migration in massive disks @xcite .",
    "this is usually referred to as type iii migration . throughout this paper , we will focus on type i migration .",
    "the torque exerted on a low - mass planet comprises the differential lindblad torque and the horseshoe drag ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the former results from the exchange of angular momentum between the planet and the circulating fluid elements located at lindblad resonances @xcite . the differential lindblad torque is generally negative @xcite , and is stationary after a few dynamical timescales @xcite .",
    "its value is however particularly sensitive to any mechanism altering the location of the resonances , such as the disk self - gravity @xcite .",
    "the horseshoe drag accounts for the exchange of angular momentum between the planet and the libratingfluid elements in the planet s horseshoe region @xcite .",
    "@xcite have clarified that the horseshoe drag actually corresponds to the corotation torque , namely the torque exerted by the corotation region about the corotation radius , the width of the horseshoe region vanishes as the planet s mass tends to zero . ] on the planet .",
    "the horseshoe drag is a non - linear phenomenon that can not be captured by linear theory @xcite , except at early times , before fluid streamlines get fully adjusted to the planet s introduction in a timescale comparable to the horseshoe u - turn time @xcite .",
    "contrary to the differential lindblad torque , the horseshoe drag can be either positive or negative , and it is generally not a stationary quantity . in isothermal disks ,",
    "its time dependence is related to the time evolution of the disk vortensity ( the vorticity to surface density ratio ) in the horseshoe region .",
    "the maximum value of the horseshoe drag scales with the ( opposite of the ) unperturbed vortensity gradient across the horseshoe region @xcite .",
    "this maximum value is called the fully unsaturated horseshoe drag .",
    "it is positive for surface density profiles locally shallower than @xmath0 . in the particular case of a planet fixed in an inviscid disk ,",
    "the horseshoe region is closed and vortensity is conserved along horseshoe streamlines . as vortensity is progressively stirred up in the horseshoe region , the horseshoe drag oscillates with time with a decreasing amplitude .",
    "the horseshoe drag ultimately cancels out as vortensity gets uniformly distributed after several libration times @xcite .",
    "this is known as the horseshoe drag saturation .    for radiative disks in the adiabatic limit",
    ", the horseshoe drag has an additional contribution , whose maximum value scales with the ( opposite of the ) unperturbed entropy gradient across the horseshoe region @xcite .",
    "this additional contribution is called entropy - related horseshoe drag .",
    "the contribution already existing in isothermal disks , and which features the vortensity gradient , is similarly denoted as vortensity - related horseshoe drag for future reference .",
    "the entropy - related horseshoe drag is positive for negative entropy gradients .",
    "it can therefore slow down , halt or even reverse @xcite type i migration compared to isothermal disk models , as long as saturation does not occur .      as described above , the horseshoe drag in isothermal disks saturates as vortensity is strictly advected along horseshoe streamlines .",
    "viscosity , which acts as a source term in the vortensity equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can sustain a non - zero vortensity gradient across the horseshoe region .",
    "if so , the vortensity - related horseshoe drag would attain a steady - state value @xcite , which arises from a net exchange of angular momentum between the horseshoe region and the rest of the disk .",
    "in particular , the torque remains unsaturated when the viscous diffusion time across the horseshoe region is somewhat larger than the horseshoe u - turn time @xcite , but smaller than the libration time ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . at large viscosities ,",
    "the horseshoe drag decreases with increasing viscosity , as viscous diffusion tends to impose the initial vortensity profile .",
    "this behavior is known as the cut - off of the horseshoe drag @xcite . for strong enough viscosities ,",
    "the horseshoe drag coincides with the linear estimate of the corotation torque @xcite .",
    "it is still quite uncertain how the horseshoe drag desaturation operates in radiative disks .",
    "the vortensity - related horseshoe drag presumably requires the same constraint on viscosity as in isothermal disk models .",
    "similarly , @xcite argued that the entropy - related horseshoe drag should remain fully unsaturated if the timescale for restoring the unperturbed entropy gradient is also bound by the horseshoe u - turn and libration timescales .",
    "this result has been independently verified by @xcite and by @xcite , who respectively considered thermal diffusion and radiative effects as the dominant physical process sustaining the entropy gradient .",
    "however , the desaturations of both parts of the horseshoe drag are likely to be coupled .",
    "in particular , some viscosity should always be required to unsaturate the entropy - related horseshoe drag , so as to allow the exchange of angular momentum between the horseshoe region and the rest of the disk .",
    "a systematic study involving different viscous and thermal diffusion coefficients will certainly give more insight into the desaturation process in radiative disks .",
    "the horseshoe drag also plays a key role in another mechanism potentially halting migration .",
    "@xcite showed that type i migration can be stalled near positive surface density transitions , when planets migrate toward underdense regions in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "these density transitions can be caused by ionization transitions , which may occur near the snow line @xcite , or near the inner edge of the dead zone ( the region near the disk mid - plane sandwiched together by partially ionized surface layers ) .",
    "as the planet drifts inwards , the slope of the local density profile becomes increasingly positive .",
    "the positive horseshoe drag strongly increases , and migration halts when it balances the negative differential lindblad torque .",
    "the ability of these so - called planet traps to stall migration depends on the horseshoe drag amplitude , hence on the local dissipation processes regulating its desaturation .      whether one invokes",
    "the gas thermodynamics to slow down , halt or reverse migration , or the presence of planet traps to stall migration , dissipation processes , including viscosity , must be taken into account . in the framework of planet migration ,",
    "protoplanetary disks are commonly assumed to be laminar , with a constant viscosity whose amplitude aims at modeling the turbulent transport of angular momentum .",
    "turbulence may originate from hydrodynamic instabilities , such as the rossby - wave instability @xcite , the global baroclinic instability @xcite , or the kelvin - helmholtz instability , triggered by the vertical shear of the gas as dust settles in the mid - plane @xcite .",
    "another source of turbulence is the so - called magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "this instability relies on the coupling of the ionized gas to the weak magnetic field of the disk .",
    "ionization may occur in the vicinity of the central object due to the star irradiation , or further out in the disk layers , most probably through the uv background or cosmic rays .",
    "the ionization state of the disk mid - plane , where protoplanets build up and migrate , is rather unclear .",
    "it is still a matter of debate whether the disk mid - plane should be ionized as well , or if it remains neutral , being shielded by the layers . in any case , its ionization state may significantly evolve with time @xcite .",
    "so far , only magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence has been extensively studied in numerical simulations of planet - disk interactions .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have investigated the properties of gap formation by giant planets in turbulent disks . @xcite and @xcite have revisited type i migration for one or several planets embedded in turbulent disks .",
    "they found that low - mass planets evolve on a random walk , in contrast to the systematic decay expected in laminar disks .",
    "it is unclear whether , with longer simulations , the time - averaged stochastic torque due to turbulence would become negligible compared to the total mean torque .",
    "another open question is whether this total mean torque significantly differs from that obtained in laminar disks . in this regard",
    ", a systematic study of the horseshoe drag behavior with turbulence has not been done yet .",
    "we eventually point out that all aforementioned studies have assumed a fully magnetized disk .",
    "simulations of planets interacting with disks harboring a dead zone have not been performed yet .      in this paper , we investigate the impact of turbulence on the horseshoe drag .",
    "can the horseshoe drag remain unsaturared with turbulence ?",
    "can migration be stalled at planet traps with turbulence ?",
    "three - dimensional mhd calculations would certainly be an elegant way to answer these questions .",
    "nonetheless , the horseshoe drag saturation typically occurs on several hundreds of orbits for planets subject to type i migration .",
    "the computational cost of 3d mhd calculations properly resolving the horseshoe region over several hundreds of orbits is prohibitive .",
    "we perform instead two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the model of @xcite ( hereafter lsa04 ) for mimicking the properties of mhd turbulence .",
    "further simplification is obtained by assuming an isothermal disk .",
    "the inclusion of the disk thermodynamics will be investigated in a subsequent study .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we describe the numerical set - up of our simulations . the turbulence model used in our study is detailed in   [ sec : turb ] , in particular we assess the minimum duration of the calculations to reach torque convergence .",

    "discussion and conclusions follow in   [ sec : discuss ] .",

    "[ sec : turb ] , we describe in this section the numerical set - up of our calculations .",
    "we use the two - dimensional code fargo in its isothermal version .",
    "it is a staggered mesh code that solves the navier - stokes and continuity equations on a polar grid .",
    "an upwind transport scheme is used along with a harmonic , second - order slope limiter @xcite .",
    "its specificity is to use a change of rotating frame on each ring of the grid , which increases the timestep significantly @xcite .",
    "the code units are the following .",
    "the initial orbital radius @xmath1 of the planet is the length unit , the mass of the central object @xmath2 is the mass unit , and @xmath3 is the time unit , @xmath4 being the gravitational constant ( @xmath5 in our unit system ) . the orbital period at @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the polar coordinates by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the disk is initially axisymmetric and rotates at the sub - keplerian angular velocity @xmath10 .",

    "the initial surface density is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 by default .",
    "the smallest value of the toomre parameter at @xmath6 then amounts to @xmath18 .",
    "the disk self - gravity is thus neglected throughout this study .",
    "should we have included the full self - gravity , the differential lindblad torque would have been larger by less than @xmath19 @xcite . no kinematic viscosity is included when the turbulent potential is applied to the disk . for comparison , runs without turbulence , but with a constant kinematic viscosity @xmath20 are also performed .",

    "the softening length of the planet s potential is @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 . for the planet masses considered in   [ sec : numres ] , @xmath28 ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 .",

    "it is based on applying an external _ turbulent _ potential to the disk .",
    "we show in this section that the properties of this potential ( spatial and temporal fluctuations , amplitude ) can be tuned so that the perturbations it induces much resemble those obtained with 3d mhd calculations . as in the original work of lsa04 , the turbulent potential @xmath33 applied to",

    "the latter assumption is motivated by the fact that high-@xmath48 modes contribute less to the turbulent potential , since @xmath54 , within smaller time intervals ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "the upper dashed line overplotted in figure  [ spectrum ] indicates that this spectrum decreases as @xmath61 .",
    "we comment that in absence of modes cut - off in the turbulent potential , the power spectrum features both the modes that are directly forced by the turbulent potential , and the modes induced by energy cascade from larger scales . a detailed comparison with kolmogorov theory of weakly compressible fluids turbulence would not be strictly relevant here .",

    "interestingly , laminar runs with @xmath81 in the range @xmath272 $ ] have steady torques that exceed the fully unsaturated torque obtained without viscosity . for any viscosity in this range",
    ", the torque excess appears after a time comparable to the horseshoe u - turn time ( which indicates that the torque excess is likely an excess of horseshoe drag ) , and it reaches a maximum value in about a libration time .",

    "a look at the horseshoe drag formulation of @xcite ( their equation 22 ) suggests that the torque excess can arise from a modification of the horseshoe streamlines ( e.g. a slight shift of the separatrices ) , or of the profiles of vortensity inverse @xmath277 at the upstream parts of the horseshoe region ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the modification of these profiles with viscosity , and therefore the mechanism that triggers the torque excess , deserves a detailed study , which goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "turbulent runs do not feature such a torque excess .",

    "density profiles obtained at @xmath255 orbits for laminar runs with similar values of the vortensity s diffusion coefficient are overplotted as dashed curves . at low - viscosity ,",
    "laminar profiles are not strictly stationary , since a shallow gap ultimately forms around the planet , as can be seen in the turbulent run with @xmath59 .",
    "as already shown , the gap s impact on our results is weak , and we neglect it in the following . as @xmath35 increases , profiles with turbulence tend to steepen around the planet , whereas laminar profiles almost coincide ( and will stay so on the long term for the largest viscosities ) . up to @xmath65 , laminar and",
    "turbulent profiles take similar values around the planet , which indicates that the time - averaged lindblad torque with turbulence , @xmath278 , should approximately equal that of the laminar run , @xmath279 . for @xmath280 ,",
    "the averaged density profile is reduced by @xmath281 with turbulence , which should decrease the lindblad torque accordingly , as the slope of the density profile has little impact on the lindblad torque . to now estimate the impact of the density change with turbulence on the horseshoe drag , we show in the the right panel of figure  [ longterm ] the vortensity profiles for previous runs ( time - averaged profiles for turbulent runs , and stationary profiles for laminar runs ) .",
    "they are depicted in a narrow range around the horseshoe region , the location of its separatrices are indicated as dash - dotted lines .",
    "also , all profiles have been slightly offset to facilitate the comparison of their slopes .",
    "for @xmath59 , turbulent and laminar vortensity profiles hardly differ , which justifies that the total torques are in very good agreement .",
    "nonetheless , for higher values of @xmath35 , time - averaged vortensity gradients are smaller with turbulence , by about @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 for @xmath285 , @xmath65 , and @xmath280 , respectively . for @xmath285 , because the averaged density at the planet location is similar in turbulent and laminar runs , the averaged horseshoe drag with turbulence , @xmath286 , should be @xmath281 smaller than the stationary horseshoe drag of the laminar run , @xmath287 .",
    "using the left panel of figure  [ finalrta ] , it turns out that , if the torque difference between laminar and turbulent runs was only due to the density change with turbulence , the averaged total torque with turbulence would be @xmath288 , which is about @xmath14 larger than its actual value . similarly , for @xmath65 , the torque with turbulence would be @xmath289 , which differs from its actual value by about @xmath13 . for @xmath280 ,",
    "the horseshoe drag is altered by the change of the vortensity gradient and of the density at the planet location .",
    "again , if the difference between laminar and turbulent torques arose from the density time - evolution with turbulence , the total torque with turbulence would be @xmath290 , which is only @xmath291 smaller than its actual value .",
    "note that , for @xmath280 , the reductions of the ( positive ) horseshoe drag and of the ( negative ) lindblad torque almost compensate , which conspires to make the running - time averaged torque a remarkably stationary quantity . from the above comparison , we conclude that the torque differences at high - turbulence between turbulent and laminar runs can be accounted for by the time - evolution in turbulent runs of the surface density profile around the planet location .",
    "the time - evolution of the surface density profile with turbulence signifies that the initial smooth @xmath292 profile is not the equilibrium density profile for our turbulence model .",
    "the equilibrium profile departs significantly from a simple power - law profile , as suggested by the flat density transition around @xmath293 at high - turbulence .",
    "however , since we observe a tendency for the time - averaged density profile to slowly steepen around the planet location , one may wonder whether the density profile could tend toward a @xmath0 profile , which would yield a uniform vortensity equilibrium profile . to verify this trend",
    ", we performed several calculations with an initial @xmath0 surface density profile , at high - turbulence ( @xmath294 , corresponding to @xmath295 ) .",
    "after about 3000 orbits , we find this time that the time - averaged density profile significantly flattens out .",
    "it is possible that the equilibrium density profile is between the @xmath292 and @xmath0 profiles , and we have not reached yet this equilibrium . in any case",
    ", it is likely that turbulence will tend to structure the averaged density profile , due to local variations in the turbulent stress .",
    "a numerical artifact due to our set of boundary conditions also can not be ruled out . recall that in all of our calculations , wave - damping zones are used along the inner and outer edges of the disk , to avoid reflections .",
    "this set of boundary conditions leads to slowly depleting the disk mass outside of the damping zones , in a timescale that depends on the turbulence strength .",
    "it explains why , with increasing @xmath35 , the time - averaged density profile with turbulence takes smaller values around the planet . for the highest values of @xmath35 that we considered",
    ", we found that forcing all fields in the damping zones toward their initial value , as in @xcite , or toward their instantaneous axisymmetric value , has little impact on the density profile around the planet .",
    "similar results were obtained with a planet mass twice as large ( @xmath296 ) , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ finalrta ] .",
    "note that these runs were performed over @xmath297 orbits , and not over @xmath246 orbits as in previous series with @xmath228 . at a given value of @xmath35 , differences between laminar and turbulent density profiles are thus smaller with @xmath296 than with @xmath228 , and so are the total torques .",
    "in addition , two difficulties arise with @xmath296 .",
    "first , the gap clearance occurs much faster .",
    "for instance , the fully saturated torque of the laminar run with the smallest viscosity ( @xmath298 ) increases by @xmath299 between 400 and 1000 orbits .",
    "this increasing rate is about 10 times larger than for an equivalent laminar run with @xmath228 . for the smallest viscosities , for laminar and turbulent runs , torques were thus evaluated before the systematic increase due to the gap opening .",
    "furthermore , the torque of the laminar inviscid run experiences large - amplitude , fast oscillations after @xmath300 orbits .",
    "these oscillations are triggered by the formation of vortices flowing along the edges of the planet gap @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations is several times larger than the differential lindblad torque , and their period is comparable to the planet s orbital period .",
    "we do not get any vortices and torque oscillations in the laminar run with the smallest viscosity ( @xmath298 ) .",
    "we have shown in   [ sec : complam ] that , when it is time - averaged over a sufficiently long time period , the torque evaluated in a turbulent model is in very good agreement with the torque obtained with a similar laminar model , providing both models have same vortensity s diffusion coefficients ( @xmath301 with previous notations ) . under these precautions , the mean saturation levels of the horseshoe drag in turbulent and laminar calculations are therefore very close .",
    "this agreement indicates that , in time - average , the properties of the horseshoe region ( width , vortensity advection - diffusion ) should be similar in both cases . to investigate these properties",
    ", we performed a laminar and a turbulent calculations with @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "the disk aspect ratio at the planet location was increased to @xmath153 , so that the strong vortensity perturbations induced by the planet wake are located outside of the horseshoe region .",
    "the laminar run has a kinematic viscosity @xmath304 ( in code units ) , which is equivalent to @xmath305 at the planet location .",
    "similarly , the turbulent simulation was performed with @xmath285 , which corresponds to @xmath306 from equation  ( [ alpha2 ] ) .",
    "this viscosity value is low enough so that the surface density profiles of the turbulent and laminar runs are not significantly altered over the duration of these runs ( 600 orbits ) .",
    "we display in the left panel of figure  [ vortplots ] the relative perturbation of the vortensity field ( with respect to its initial profile ) for the laminar calculation , at @xmath245 orbits .",
    "overplotted as solid curves are streamlines in the planet s frame .",
    "the two particular streamlines passing very close to the planet location ( @xmath6 , @xmath307 ) are the horseshoe separatrices .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the location of the planet s corotation radius @xmath308 , where @xmath309 .",
    "it also corresponds to the planet s orbital radius @xmath1 , as the unperturbed pressure profile is uniform for these runs .",
    "since the unperturbed vortensity profile decreases with radius , vortensity advection - diffusion yields negative vortensity perturbations along inward downstream streamlines ( @xmath310 , @xmath311 ) , and positive vortensity perturbations along outward downstream streamlines ( @xmath312 , @xmath313 ) .",
    "these vortensity perturbations decrease in a timescale comparable to the viscous diffusion time across the horseshoe region .",
    "as can be seen in the left panel of figure  [ vortplots ] , vortensity perturbations cancel out over a time @xmath314 proceeding horseshoe u - turns .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ vortplots ] shows the instantaneous vortensity perturbation for the turbulent run , at the same time . for the turbulence amplitude taken here ,",
    "the vortensity perturbations due to turbulence are typically larger than those obtained in the laminar run .",
    "instantaneous streamlines are also depicted as solid curves , which highlight a random walk motion rather than well - defined circulating and librating motions around the ( expected ) horseshoe region .    however , with turbulence , we are primarily interested in the time - averaged fields .",
    "we thus display in the right panel of figure  [ vortplots ] the perturbed vortensity time - averaged between 400 and 600 orbits . to calculate this time - average ,",
    "fields outputs were produced every @xmath315 of orbit , which is approximately half the lifetime of the turbulent mode with @xmath62 .",
    "solid lines depict streamlines averaged over the same time period , using the same time sample .",
    "the two streamlines passing near the planet location show the time - averaged separatrices of the mean horseshoe region .",
    "all other streamlines of the left and right panels of figure  [ vortplots ] are calculated with the same initial coordinates in the @xmath316 plane , and are therefore directly comparable .",
    "we comment that the comparison with the instantaneous fields and streamlines of the laminar run is fair , as a steady state is reached well before 400 orbits for this run . in the turbulent run ,",
    "fluid elements have , in time - average , librating streamlines inside of a mean horseshoe region , and circular streamlines outside of it .",
    "the averaged streamlines of the turbulent run much resemble the instantaneous streamlines of the laminar run . in particular ,",
    "the half - width of the mean horseshoe region with turbulence does not significantly differ from that without turbulence .",
    "the time - averaged vortensity perturbations are also very similar to those of the laminar run .",
    "this qualitative agreement signifies that both simulations do have similar values of the vortensity s diffusion coefficient , as _ a priori _ expected from our relationship between @xmath35 and @xmath141 .",
    "the above comparison leads us to the following comments . in time - average",
    ", turbulence tends to `` diffuse '' vortensity , analogous to the effect of viscosity in laminar disks .",
    "this similarity could be surprising at first glance since the turbulent potential can not act as a source term in the vortensity equation . with our turbulent potential",
    ", vortensity is therefore conserved along _ instantaneous _ streamlines . nonetheless ,",
    "random motions triggered by turbulence cause turbulent diffusion , so that the vortensity along _ time - averaged _ streamlines is not conserved . as shown in   [ sec : schmidt ] , this process can be modeled by a simple diffusion law , featuring the diffusion coefficient @xmath141 . in the appendix",
    ", we derive the time - averaged vortensity equation for a two - dimensional disk subject to the turbulent potential .",
    "convergence properties of the running - time averaged torque for the turbulent runs of   [ sec : issues ] .",
    "the torque obtained with our standard resolution ( @xmath317 ) and with the @xmath56 modes cut - off is depicted with a dotted line .",
    "the dot - dot - dot - dashed curve displays the torque obtained with the @xmath318 and @xmath56 modes cut - off , at the same resolution .",
    "the dashed curve shows the torque without the @xmath56 modes truncation , at the same resolution .",
    "the solid curve displays the torque with the @xmath56 modes truncation , at higher resolution ( @xmath319 ) . ]",
    "all the calculations with an embedded protoplanet were obtained with a grid resolution of @xmath317 and included the @xmath56 modes truncation in the expression of the turbulent potential .",
    "we investigate here how these assumptions affect our results . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider the turbulent model of   [ sec : desaturation ] with @xmath228 , @xmath249 and @xmath59 .",
    "three additional calculations were performed , ( i ) one at the same resolution but without the @xmath56 modes truncation , ( ii ) another one at the same resolution with cut - off of both @xmath51 and @xmath56 modes , and ( iii ) one with the @xmath56 modes truncation but with double resolution ( @xmath319 ) .",
    "the running - time averaged torques obtained with these four calculations are displayed in figure  [ convergence ] . doubling",
    "the resolution in each direction has no significant impact on the torque evaluation .",
    "although not shown here , we checked that this result holds without the @xmath56 modes truncation .",
    "this convergence in resolution is not surprising because our model does not include any feedback from the smallest length scales , where energy dissipates , to the largest ones , through which exchange of angular momentum primarily occurs .",
    "the reason for this is that turbulent modes are always regenerated independently of all other modes still at work in the disk .",
    "including an energy equation should not alter the convergence in resolution .",
    "the torque r.t.a . obtained with the additional @xmath51 modes cut - off is more negative , as expected .",
    "discarding @xmath51 modes decreases indeed the turbulence strength , and therefore the equivalent alpha viscosity @xmath141 associated to turbulence . for our value of @xmath35 , decreasing @xmath141 weakens the horseshoe drag ( see figure  [ finalrta ] ) , and the total torque is more negative .",
    "the relative difference of the total torques is @xmath299 . from the left panel of figure  [ finalrta ] ,",
    "we point out that decreasing @xmath35 by about one order - of - magnitude would make the torque obtained with the @xmath56 modes truncation almost coincide with the differential lindblad torque , which is about @xmath320 larger .",
    "this comparison underscores that , as anticipated in   [ sec : rta ] , the absence of @xmath51 modes in the study of lsa04 can not account for the order - of - magnitude difference in the expressions for the turbulent torque r.t.a . given by lsa04 and by equation  ( [ sigmaturb ] ) .",
    "discarding the @xmath56 modes cut - off renders the stationary r.t.a .",
    "torque more positive .",
    "this is also an expected result , since including @xmath56 modes is found to increase @xmath90 by a factor of @xmath321 , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : alpha ] .",
    "assuming that @xmath141 is increased by the same factor , and because @xmath322 , we expect that the r.t.a .",
    "torques obtained ( i ) with @xmath59 and without truncation , and ( ii ) with @xmath323 but with truncation , should be approximately the same . for the former run ,",
    "the steady torque is @xmath324 ( see figure  [ convergence ] ) , whereas for the latter run , it amounts to @xmath325 ( see left panel of figure  [ finalrta ] ) .",
    "this close agreement confirms that , for @xmath59 , the @xmath56 modes cut - off slightly decreases the turbulence strength .",
    "the surface density profiles obtained in previous cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , and time - averaged over 4000 orbits , are displayed in figure  [ convergence2 ] .",
    "also , we have investigated the impact of the @xmath56 modes cut - off with @xmath65 .",
    "the r.t.a .",
    "torque over @xmath246 orbits reaches a steady value of @xmath326 , which is approximately a factor of @xmath98 and @xmath327 smaller than the torques with cut - off obtained for @xmath65 and @xmath280 , respectively ( see left panel of figure  [ finalrta ] ) . clearly , for @xmath65 , the impact of the @xmath56 modes cut - off on the torque can not be explained by a slight decrease of @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ convergence2 ] shows that the corresponding density profile ( solid gray curve ) significantly differs from the density profiles with no cut - off , and obtained for @xmath65 and @xmath280 ( dash - dotted gray curves ) .",
    "interestingly , for this turbulence amplitude , the time - evolution of the disk density profile changes quite substantially without the @xmath56 modes cut - off . around the planet location ,",
    "the averaged density profile is flatter without cut - off , which increases the positive horseshoe drag , and it takes smaller values , which also makes the total torque more positive .    surface density profile time - averaged over @xmath246 orbits for turbulent runs with and without the @xmath56 modes cut - off on the expression for the turbulent potential . ]",
    "we have revisited the interaction of a low - mass planet with an isothermal turbulent disk , with a special emphasis on the horseshoe drag desaturation by turbulence .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were performed , using the turbulence model of @xcite .",
    "this model is based on applying a turbulent potential to the disk , which corresponds to the superposition of simultaneous wave - like modes .",
    "an in - depth analysis of the turbulent potential properties is undertaken in ",
    "[ sec : turb ] .",
    "we show that these properties can be selected so that perturbations generated by the turbulent potential much resemble those obtained in 3d mhd calculations .",
    "for instance , the modes lifetimes taken by @xcite are reduced by a factor of ten to attain an autocorrelation time of order one planet s orbital period .",
    "we quantify the transport of angular momentum by measuring reynolds alpha parameters @xmath90 , which we relate to the turbulence amplitude @xmath35 in equation  ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "the effect of turbulence diffusion is also quantified by evaluating vortensity s diffusion coefficients , which we model by an equivalent alpha viscosity @xmath141 .",
    "a simple relation between @xmath35 and @xmath141 is given by equation  ( [ alpha2 ] ) .",
    "an important result is that vortensity diffusion is about four times more efficient than transport of angular momentum : @xmath328 .",
    "we argue in   [ sec : schmidt ] that @xmath141 can therefore model the total alpha parameter of typical 3d mhd calculations ( assuming they have a radial schmidt number of order unity ) . should our results be checked against such calculations",
    ", one would have to set up the initial conditions such that the average reynolds alpha parameter @xmath90 be similar to one of our values ( but note that torque differences will naturally arise from the transition from 2d to 3d ) .",
    "we also provide in equation  ( [ sigmaturb ] ) an expression for the mean deviation of the turbulent torque distribution that gives good agreement with 3d mhd simulations of a disk fully invaded by the magnetorotational instability .",
    "our turbulence model should therefore be well - suited for studying disk - planet interactions not only in dead zones , where angular momentum transport is mostly transported by density waves @xcite , but also in active layers , where turbulence primarily originates .",
    "note however that our turbulence model has compressible modes only ( turbulence is driven by a scalar potential ) , whereas mri turbulence also contains incompressible ( vortical ) modes .    by using accurate estimates of the running - time averaged turbulent torque , and of the fully unsaturated torque expected in laminar disks , we give in equation  ( [ tauconv3 ] ) an upper estimate ( see   [ sec : convtime ] ) of the convergence time in our simulations .",
    "this convergence time , which is the timescale such that the running - time averaged stochastic torque becomes a small fraction of the total laminar torque , is proportional to @xmath329 .",
    "it is thus particularly sensitive to the disk scale height . for our conservative disk and planet parameters ( @xmath224 , @xmath73 , @xmath249 , @xmath191 ) , up to @xmath330 planet orbital periods",
    "are required before the running - time averaged turbulent torque attains @xmath331 of the fully unsaturated torque expected in a similar laminar model .",
    "increasing the planet mass to @xmath332 , and the disk aspect ratio to @xmath104 , yields a maximum convergence time of @xmath333 .",
    "we then present in ",
    "[ sec : numres ] our calculation results with a low - mass planet embedded in a turbulent disk . for comparison ,",
    "similar laminar calculations are performed with a kinematic viscosity @xmath334 .",
    "the main results are the following :    * the averaged differential lindblad torque with turbulence takes very similar values than in laminar disk models , providing ( i ) the former is time - averaged over a sufficiently long time period , and ( ii ) turbulence does not significantly alter the time - averaged density profile .",
    "* turbulence can unsaturate the horseshoe drag , depending on the turbulence strength",
    ". the horseshoe drag desaturation by turbulence can be modeled by vortensity diffusion across the time - averaged horseshoe region , with a diffusion coefficient @xmath335 .",
    "we comment that it is unclear how the horseshoe drag behaves when the largest size of the turbulence eddies becomes comparable to , or larger than the width of the horseshoe region .",
    "vortensity should then enter the mean horseshoe region in an advective way , rather than in a diffusive way .",
    "this situation deserves attention , particularly for low - mass planets .",
    "it is possible that the horseshoe drag value is determined by the advection timescale across the mean horseshoe region , at the averaged turbulent velocity , in comparison with the libration and u - turn timescales . * for similar vortensity s diffusion coefficients ( @xmath301 ) , time - averaged total torques with turbulence",
    "are compared with steady laminar torques in ",
    "[ sec : complam ] ( see figure  [ finalrta ] ) . at low - turbulence ,",
    "turbulent and laminar torques are in very good agreement . at high - turbulence ,",
    "differences arise , which can be fully accounted for by the time - evolution of the averaged density profile with turbulence .",
    "these results have two implications . on the one hand , the torque felt by a low - mass planet can be decomposed into a laminar torque , and a stochastic torque due to turbulence .",
    "on the other hand , the averaged value of the horseshoe drag in turbulent and laminar disk models are very similar .",
    "the same comment applies to the structure of the mean horseshoe region , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : hsregion ] .",
    "it indicates that the criterion for the horseshoe drag desaturation , @xmath336 , still holds in turbulent disks , in time - average , at least for the turbulence amplitudes considered in our study ( but see the above comment on the advective regime ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath337 corresponds to @xmath338 , where @xmath335 is the vortensity s averaged diffusion coefficient , and @xmath195 is the half - width of the mean horseshoe region .    with turbulence properties as close as possible to those of 3d mhd simulations , we find that the horseshoe drag exerted by isothermal disks on low - mass planets can remain unsaturated on the long term , depending on the turbulence strength .",
    "these results require confirmation by 3d mhd long - term simulations of planet - disk interactions , with disks either fully magnetized or harboring a dead zone .",
    "it would also be of relevant interest to investigate how accretion onto a low - mass planet can be affected by turbulent motions in the planet vicinity .",
    "in forthcoming works , we will extend our study to radiative disks , and we will investigate the trapping of a protoplanet at a density transition in presence of turbulence .    it is a pleasure to thank sbastien fromang , frdric masset and richard nelson for illuminating conversations and very fruitful suggestions .",
