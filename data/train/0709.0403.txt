    "it is well known that proto - neutron stars ( pns ) born in the aftermath of a gravitational core collapse are , during the first tens of seconds , convectively unstable @xcite .",
    "in addition , dynamical simulations of core collapse have shown that a considerable fraction of the energy emitted in gravitational waves ( gw ) is actually due to this convective motion , rather than to the violent bounce @xcite .",
    "recently , a new mechanism for core collapse supernova explosion has been proposed , based on the excitation and sonic damping of core @xmath0-mode oscillations @xcite-@xcite , and the same mechanism has also been pointed out to be relevant for gw emission @xcite .",
    "the process begins being an advective - acoustic oscillation , and in @xcite the authors suggest that the primary agent of the explosion is the acoustic power generated in the inner turbulent region ; the accreting pns is a self - excited oscillator , and the core oscillation acts as a transducer converting accretion energy into acoustic energy .",
    "surprisingly , and despite the complexity of the non - linear hydrodynamical effects involved in these simulations , the growth times , oscillation frequencies , and temporal evolution of the modes are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the predictions of a linear analysis done in @xcite ; there , the frequencies and damping times of @xmath0-modes were computed for an evolving pns , modeled as sequences of quasi - stationary configurations .",
    "these results put the @xmath0-modes in a somewhat different perspective with respect to the preceeding literature on the subject ; indeed , previous studies of @xmath0mode oscillations in neutron stars had shown that their contribution to the gravitational wave signal was likely to be too weak to be detectable by current or near - future detectors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we study the spectrum of stable and unstable @xmath0-modes of a newly - born pns , and we investigate how effective the coupling is , due to the non linearity of the equations of hydrodynamics , between unstable @xmath0-modes and oscillating @xmath0-modes .",
    "the aim is to understand whether this coupling induces @xmath0-mode oscillations which may significantly contribute to gravitational wave emission during the early phases of a proto - neutron star s life . to this purpose",
    ", we integrate the equations of relativistic stellar perturbations for the model of pns considered in @xcite , which describes the quasi - stationary evolution of a pns during the first minute after core collapse ; we look for the eigenmodes the frequency of which , at some point of the evolution , becomes imaginary or acquires a negative imaginary part , a behaviour which indicates a mode instability .",
    "we then discuss to what extent unstable and stable @xmath0-modes are coupled .",
    "it should be mentioned that the existence of an unstable branch of @xmath0modes is a natural consequence of the pns thermal and chemical profiles , since some regions of the star are convectively unstable while other regions are not .",
    "thus , even at the linear level one can see that both stable and unstable @xmath0-modes are present .",
    "the linear analysis allows to determine which is the fastest growing mode and the frequencies of the oscillatory modes .",
    "the pns we consider , at very early stage has a radius of about 100 km , and it gradually contracts in a few seconds .",
    "it has a fixed baryonic mass of 1.6 @xmath1 , which corresponds to a final gravitational mass ( after deleptonization and cooling ) of 1.46 @xmath1 .",
    "the radius of the pns at t=50 ms after bounce is 50 km but just 1 second later , due to neutrino losses from the envelope , the star contracts to a radius of less than 20 km .",
    "the final radius of the cold , catalyzed ns ( after 30 - 40 seconds ) is 12 km . in computing the g - mode eigenfrequencies at selected values of time ,",
    "we have taken the corresponding radial profiles ( mass , pressure , temperature , lepton content , etc . )",
    "provided by the evolutionary models of @xcite , already used in @xcite .",
    "evaluating the effect of nonlinear couplings between different modes is a formidable task ; however an estimate of the leading order contributions can be provided using a newtonian approach based on the amplitude equation formalism developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we describe the mathematical and numerical setup of our calculations ; in section [ modes ] we discuss the structure of stable and unstable @xmath0-modes in pns ; in section [ coupling ] we study the coupling between different modes in terms of appropriate integrals of the radial eigenfunctions ; concluding remarks are in section [ concl ] .",
    "the equations governing the perturbations of spherical stars in general relativity have been derived within different approaches by many authors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "here we use the lindblom - splinter ( ls ) equations derived in @xcite , which describe dipolar ( @xmath2 ) perturbations , and the lindblom - detweiler ( ld ) equations derived in @xcite , for @xmath3 perturbations .",
    "the metric and the fluid four - velocity of the spherical background describing the unperturbed star are @xmath4 where the functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 satisfy the tov equations ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we shall assume that matter in the star is a perfect fluid .",
    "the metric perturbations and the eulerian fluid perturbations are expanded in spherical harmonics @xmath7 , and fourier - expanded as described in @xcite . in particular , the radial component of the lagrangian displacement is @xmath8 the perturbed einstein equations @xmath9 provide a system of linear , ordinary differential equations ( ode ) for the radial components of the harmonic expansion of the metric and fluid perturbations . since the structure of the equations for @xmath2 and for @xmath10 is quite different , we will treat the two cases separately .",
    "@xmath2 perturbations are not associated to gravitational wave emission .",
    "therefore , since we are neglecting further dissipative effects like viscosity or heat transport , oscillation modes are undamped , _",
    "normal modes _ and the corresponding eigenfrequencies , @xmath11 , are real .",
    "dipolar oscillations are described by the ls equations , which form a linear , third order ode system @xcite . in order to find the mode eigenfrequencies",
    ", these equations have to be integrated from the center ( where regularity conditions must be imposed ) up to the stellar surface , for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "the solutions satisfy the required boundary condition at the surface , i.e. the vanishing of the lagrangian perturbation of the pressure , only for a discrete set of values of @xmath12 : these are the normal mode eigenfrequencies .",
    "the equations depend on @xmath12 quadratically , and since all terms in these equations and all boundary conditions are _ real _ , there is no restriction in assuming that the perturbation functions and @xmath13 are real , i.e. in looking for normal modes .",
    "unstable modes correspond to solutions belonging to @xmath14 .",
    "they are non oscillating , exponentially growing modes , with growth time @xmath15 given by @xmath16 for @xmath17 , stellar perturbations are associated to gravitational wave emission , therefore the corresponding modes , said _ quasi - normal modes _ , are damped and the eigenfrequencies are complex @xmath18 @xmath19 is the mode frequency , and @xmath15 is its gravitational damping time .",
    "these perturbations are described by the ld equations , which form a linear , fourth order ode system @xcite .",
    "these equations are integrated from the center , imposing regularity conditions , to the stellar surface , for different values of complex @xmath12 .",
    "for each @xmath12 there exist two regular , independent solutions which have to be matched on the stellar surface to allow the vanishing of the lagrangian perturbation of the pressure .",
    "this constraint reduces the number of independent solutions to one , modulo an overall scaling factor .",
    "outside the star , the variables associated to the fluid motion vanish and the equations reduce to a second - order ode for the zerilli function @xmath20 @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the zerilli potential and @xmath23 is the tortoise coordinate . far away from the star",
    ", the zerilli function behaves as a superposition of ingoing and ingoing waves : @xmath24 quasi - normal modes are the solutions of the ld+zerilli equations for which the ingoing component of the asymptotic solution ( [ infinity ] ) , @xmath25 , vanishes .",
    "the discrete set of frequencies corresponding to these solutions are the mode eigenfrequencies .    like the ls equations ,",
    "the ld equations have real coefficients ; however the outgoing wave boundary condition @xmath26 can not be satisfied by a real @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , in order to represent a physical mode the harmonic components of the perturbations must belong to complex frequencies . for @xmath17 unstable modes",
    "are solution of the perturbed equations with @xmath28 ; an unstable mode corresponds to a perturbation which , while oscillating , is increasingly growing in amplitude ; the oscillation frequency @xmath19 and the growth time @xmath29 of such unstable mode are given by @xmath30 .",
    "the relevant equations for @xmath31 have been integrated using an adaptive stepsize fourh - order runge - kutta method . for @xmath3",
    "the solution has been continued outside the star by integrating zerilli s equation ( [ zer ] ) using the continued fraction method @xcite ; the complex eigenfrequencies have been found as zeroes of the function @xmath32 , using a newton - raphson method .",
    "before discussing our results , we shall briefly summarize what is known in the literature about the mode structure of non rotating stars in newtonian gravity .",
    "this will serve as a guideline to understand our results for relativistic pns .",
    "the normal mode spectrum of non - rotating stars has been studied in great detail in newtonian gravity ( see for instance @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .    * since newtonian stars do not emit gravitational waves , in absence of viscous forces the square of the mode eigenfrequencies , @xmath33 , are real for any value of @xmath34 .",
    "the index @xmath35 denotes the order of the mode . if @xmath36 , the mode corresponds to a stable oscillation , while if @xmath37 the mode is a pure exponential growth .",
    "* mode eigenfrequencies group in distinct classes , identified on the basis of the restoring force which dominates in bringing back to the equilibrium position the generic fluid element displaced by the perturbation ; they are named @xmath38-modes if the restoring force is buoyancy , @xmath39-modes if it is due to pressure gradients . @xmath0-mode",
    "eigenfrequencies are smaller than those of @xmath40-modes , and the two classes are separated by the single fundamental mode ( @xmath41-mode ) frequency .",
    "* when @xmath2 , the @xmath41-mode frequency is identically zero : the @xmath41-mode does exist only for @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath2 @xmath0- and @xmath40-modes have an interesting characteristic : they correspond to a displacement of the geometrical center of the system , i.e. @xmath42 ; as pointed out in @xcite , in the @xmath2 case the geometrical center does not coincide with the center of mass of the star , which is not displaced .",
    "* there can exist two classes of @xmath0-modes : the @xmath43 modes , which are stable , and the @xmath44 , which are unstable . whether both branches of modes do exist or not depends on the sign of the schwarzschild discriminant @xmath45 * * if @xmath46 throughout the star ( as it is for barotropic eos ) , then there are no @xmath0-modes ( or , more precisely , they are all degenerate to zero frequency ) . * * if @xmath47 throughout the star ( convective stability ) , there are only @xmath48-modes . * * if @xmath49 throughout the star ( convective instability ) , there are only @xmath50-modes . * * if @xmath47 in some region of the star , and @xmath49 in some other region , then both @xmath48-modes and @xmath50-modes are present .",
    "+ thus , the sign of the schwarzschild discriminant reveals the presence of convective instabilities , and of unstable @xmath0-modes .",
    "@xmath40-modes and the @xmath41-mode are always stable . *",
    "typically , for @xmath51- and @xmath39-modes the number of nodes in the eigenfunction of @xmath52 is equal to @xmath35 ( not counting the node at @xmath53 for @xmath54 ) .",
    "the @xmath41-mode eigenfunction has no nodes inside the star .",
    "however , such simple prescriptions may not hold in some cases @xcite .",
    "let us now consider our relativistic pns .",
    "in order to find the frequencies of the quasi - normal modes , we have integrated the equations that describe the perturbations of a spherical star taking as a background the ",
    "stationary \" evolutionary models derived in @xcite .",
    "`` quasi  stationary '' means that the stellar interior is described by a sequence of equilibrium configurations , which have been shown to adequately describe the evolution of a pns for @xmath55 s after bounce @xcite .",
    "these models have been used in @xcite to compute how the quasi - normal mode frequencies of stable , quadrupole modes evolve in time . here",
    "we consider the equation of state named gm3 , with no quark matter in the core , and explore the time interval from @xmath56s up to @xmath57s after bounce .",
    "we find both stable and unstable @xmath0-modes .",
    "unstable modes are present because the relativistic schwarzschild discriminant @xcite @xmath58 is negative in some region inside the star , revealing the presence of convective instability ) is the opposite to that assumed for the newtonian discriminant ( [ sd ] ) . ] .    to compare our results with the literature on newtonian stars ( in particular , with figure 1 of @xcite ) , we define a real , square frequency , @xmath59 , as follows .    * for @xmath2 , @xmath60 is always real ; it is positive for stable modes , negative for unstable modes .",
    "therefore we define @xmath61 . * for @xmath17 , @xmath11 is complex . for stable fluid modes , in general @xmath62 , whereas for unstable modes @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we can define @xmath64    the mode structure of the considered stellar model is shown in figure [ fig1 ] , where @xmath33 is plotted for different values of the harmonic index @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath33 is plotted for the first two unstable @xmath0-modes , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , for the first two stable @xmath0-modes , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and for the fundamental mode .",
    "the figure refers to @xmath69 s after bounce .",
    "+     after bounce.,width=226 ]    we see that @xmath59 has a dependence on @xmath34 similar to that shown in the newtonian case @xcite .",
    "we remind that the main difference is that for @xmath10 in the relativistic case @xmath60 is complex : the frequency of stable modes acquires a small imaginary part corresponding to the damping induced by gravitational wave emission , while that of unstable modes acquires a small real part .",
    "let us now focus on the behaviour of unstable @xmath0-modes .",
    "the lowest dipole mode , ( i.e. @xmath65 for @xmath2 ) , at @xmath69 s after bounce has a growth time @xmath70 ms .",
    "this is very interesting because , since @xmath71 is extremely small , the amplitude of this mode may have enough time to grow significantly before being damped by other dissipative effects , or by non - linear couplings . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the growth times of the lowest unstable @xmath0-modes are even smaller ; for instance , for @xmath72 , @xmath73 ms . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show how the growth time of the lowest unstable @xmath0-modes for @xmath74 changes during the first @xmath75 s of the pns life .",
    "we see that , after an initial decrease , all @xmath76 s increase with time ; however , they remain quite small , being their maximum values of the order of a few ms .",
    "after about @xmath75 s , the star becomes convectively stable and unstable modes disappear .    for @xmath3 unstable @xmath0-modes",
    "have a small oscillating part , which is of the order of @xmath77 hz and can be neglected .",
    "-modes during the first 25 seconds of the pns life .",
    "[ ttau],width=226 ]",
    "the existence of rapidly growing , unstable @xmath0-modes indicates , at a linear level , the onset of an effective convective instability ; this motivates our further investigation on mode coupling , to see whether unstable modes , coupling to stable ones , may trigger gravitational wave emission at frequencies which fall in the bandwidth of ground based interferometers , as shown in @xcite .",
    "a first thing one can do is to see whether the corresponding eigenfunctions overlap : if they do not , we would have a strong indication that the coupling is ineffective . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we compare , as an example , the radial eigenfunctions of the lowest , stable and unstable @xmath0-modes belonging to @xmath74 .",
    "-modes , plotted for @xmath74 as functions of the normalized radius .",
    "the schwarzschild discriminant @xmath78 is positive on the left of the dashed vertical line , negative on the right .",

    "the lagrangian displacement @xmath81 is expressed as a superposition of modes @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the mode eigenfunctions , normalized by imposing @xmath84 , and @xmath85 are the corresponding amplitudes . for non - resonant modes ,",

    "the evaluation of the coupling coefficients @xmath92 , the expressions of which are given in @xcite and @xcite , is a very hard task .",
    "since we need an order of magnitude estimate , we shall compute only a leading term .",
    "in particular , we shall use the expressions of @xmath92 given in @xcite , but we have checked that using those given in @xcite the results are of the same order of magnitude .",
