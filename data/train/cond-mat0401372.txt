    "the minority game ( mg ) is an adaptive game suitable to study competitive systems whose available resources are finite @xcite- . in spite of the simplicity of the rules of the game , it presents a very rich behavior and interesting properties .    in this game",
    "there is a number of players ( agents ) that must choose , _ independently _ , one of two alternatives at each time step , splitting into two groups .",
    "the winners are those who stay at the minority side in that step .",
    "as we explain in the next section , there are three main ingredients in the game :  ( i ) a _ public _ history , with the information of the _ m _ previous minority sides ;  ( ii ) some prescriptions ( strategies ) to play with , and ( iii ) a reward system , whereby points are given to winning agents and strategies .",
    "these ingredients induce an emergent coordination whereby the system can be more efficient ( in a sense explained below ) than a random game .",
    "in fact , this is the main reason for the interest shown by many people on the behavior of the model .",
    "a recent line of research introduces modifications into the mg , designed to approach the behavior of the players to that of the agents in a real market .",
    "agents in an economy take decisions based on heterogeneous external information available at each time , plus internal information , including their personal preferences .",
    "the heterogeneous external information can be either global , such as an aggregate variable , or local .",
    "some of those investigations study the effect of changes in the external information available in the mg .",
    "the work of m. paczuski et al .",
    "@xcite develops a version of kauffman s model with certain rules of the mg .",
    "other works introduce versions of the mg with local information . between these , that of kalinowski et al .",
    "@xcite places the agents on a circle ;  every agent gets the previous decisions of her @xmath0 neighbors ( half to her right , half to her left ) as an input information ; together with her own decision , she builds up a history of _ m _ bits . in this form there is a _ local _ history for each player .",
    "the rest of the rules are as in the usual mg .",
    "s. moelbert et al .",
    "@xcite recently introduced a _",
    "local mg _ , where they use a local determination of the minority and the corresponding local histories .    in this work some kind of local information will be made available to a fraction @xmath1 of the @xmath2  agents ( @xmath3 ; we will refer to them as the _ interacting agents .",
    "_ as we will see , they will be able to change their original decisions , in order to be in the minority of their neighborhoods .    in the next section",
    "we describe the model , and present the results found ;  in section [ conclusiones ] some conclusions are drawn .",
    "in the mg model there are @xmath2 agents , each one with @xmath4 strategies distributed at random ( with reposition ) at the beginning of the game . the strategies",
    "assign one output ( 0 or 1 ) for every one of the @xmath5 possible inputs ( @xmath6 .",
    ", histories ) . as a result of their choices",
    ", at each step of the game the players split into two groups of size @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .",
    "every winner agent gets a point after each step of the game . besides",
    ", out of all the strategies playing in the game , those that correctly predict the minority side of the time step @xmath10 , obtain a reward , called a virtual point .",
    "the agents use the virtual points to establish the performance of her strategies and to choose , at each step of the game , the more successful one to play with .",
    "the main variable considered in this model is @xmath11 , the standard deviation of the difference @xmath12",
    "@xmath13    where _ t _ is the number of time steps of the game .",
    "this variable measures the form in which the resources of all the players are used .",
    "when @xmath14 is small , the minority group is bigger , and the agents , as a whole , receive more points .",
    "hence , smaller values of @xmath11 indicate a better use of the resources by the population . as mentioned above",
    ", the interest on this model is mainly due to the fact that for certain values of the variables _ m , s , _ and _ _",
    "_   the standard deviation turns out to be smaller than in the case of a random game .",
    "the characterization of this collective behavior generated many studies of the mg , with a variety of techniques : numerical simulations @xcite , @xcite ; mean - field approximations @xcite ; equivalence with spin - glass models @xcite ; thermal treatments @xcite ; etc .    to introduce local information , we need to arrange the agents in such a form that it makes sense to talk about the neighborhood of every one of them . hence , we distribute all the players on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the positions of the @xmath15 interacting agents on the lattice are chosen randomly , at the beginning of the game . at each time",
    "step the agents follow the usual rules of the mg , but the interacting agents @xmath16 are given the extra opportunity to modify their bets , after knowing what their nearest neighbors @xmath17 will do in the @xmath18 step . as they were distributed randomly ,  every one of them can have between zero and four @xmath19 as nearest neighbors .",
    "this agent will try to be in the minority of the group formed by her @xmath17 nearest neighbors , plus herself .",
    "hence , if more than half of her neighbors choose one side , then the @xmath17 will chose the other , regardless of what her best strategy says ; but if half of the neighbors choose each side , then the @xmath17 will decide in agreement with the prescription of her best strategy , @xmath20 the one with more virtual points . with this rule , she can eventually choose one option that none of her strategies prescribe for a given history .",
    "once all the agents have made their choice , they make their moves _ simultaneously_. finally , one obtains the minority as usual , by considering the actions of all the players .",
    "as far as the players are concerned , points are distributed with the same rule than in the mg , but whenever a player wins because she plays against the majority of her local neighborhood , then no points are added to her strategies .",
    "the fact that the @xmath17 positions are chosen randomly raises the question of  the relevance of the actual number of links between interacting agents , @xmath21 for every specific realization ( @xmath20 for every sample ) , for a fixed value @xmath22 we considered this factor , and found that in this case it only has minor effects @xcite .",
    "we have made extensive numerical simulations , finding @xmath23 as a function of both @xmath1 and @xmath24 . in the following",
    "we will refer to @xmath25 as the _ _  reduced variance _ _ , and use @xmath26 for short .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the graph of @xmath27 _ vs _ @xmath28 displays two different informational behaviors : an efficient phase for @xmath29 , and an inefficient phase for bigger values of @xmath28 .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath30 is the greatest value of @xmath28 for which the system is dominated by a period - two , maladaptive dynamics that is explained below .     as a function of _",
    "z _ , for @xmath2=225 agents , and several values of @xmath1 , indicated in the inset . out of a total of @xmath31 time steps ,",
    "data was collected in the last @xmath32 steps.,width=453 ]    in fig.[disper7 ] we can see the ensuing changes in the reduced variance , as @xmath1 increases from @xmath33 , @xmath20 the mg with no interacting agents , to @xmath34 , when all the agents are interacting . for small values of @xmath1",
    "the function @xmath35 has a shape similar to that of the mg case , but there is a shift to the left of its minimum , implying an improved efficiency for small values of @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , the minimum @xmath37 is smaller than the corresponding mg value .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , the shape of the curve changes , and for @xmath34 the reduced variance is   roughly constant , and the efficiency is clearly worst than in the mg case .    in the following",
    "we will restrict ourselves to consider the first , informationally efficient region .",
    "we now will relate this behavior with the crowd - anticrowd picture @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the minority game has , for @xmath38 , a remarkable period - two dynamics ( ptd ) , whereby during the odd appearances of a given history , the resulting minority is random , but then in the following , even appearance , the minority is just the opposite to the previous one .",
    "moreover , if we distinguish even and odd occurrences of the histories , _ i.e. _ we calculate the standard deviation @xmath39 for the time steps in which the histories occur an even ( odd ) number of times , it turns out that @xmath40 is of the order of @xmath41 , while @xmath42 @xmath43  if @xmath44 this is true for almost all the steps of the game ; as @xmath36 increases , this rule is true only in a ( decreasing ) number of steps , and when @xmath45 or greater , the opposite happens :  the ` even ' minority tends to be the same than the previous ,  ` odd ' one .",
    "this was first observed and explained by manuca _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , as due to the formation of crowds ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) . in a few words , this happens as follows : during the first ( odd ) occurrence of a history , the strategies of the players have the same amount of virtual points , and therefore they will pick side randomly , so that @xmath46 ; thereafter , the winner strategies will get a point . during the second ( even ) appearance of the same history , agents having those strategies will bias the outcome , choosing the same side as before .",
    "hence , the minority will be just the opposite than the previous one ; on the other hand , @xmath7 and @xmath47 will be very different , so that @xmath48 @xmath43 now the strategies receiving virtual points are those complementary to the first set ; in this form all strategies have roughly the same amount of points , closing a ` cycle ' .",
    "we begin by studying the effect of the interactions on the @xmath38 case ; as we will see , for small values of @xmath1 the system still follows the ptd , but as @xmath49 increases the period - two regime will disappear .",
    "figure [ disper4 ] shows data for @xmath50 as a function of @xmath51 for @xmath52 = 361 , 1089 and 3721 ( these are just three representative examples of all the cases we have considered ) .",
    "we discarded the first 10@xmath53 time steps for @xmath54 , and 5 10@xmath53 for bigger values of @xmath2 , and collected data along the next 10@xmath55 time steps .",
    "all the results shown are averages over 32 independent realizations .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have studied a modification of the rules of the minority game , hoping to retain the main ideas of the model , and at the same time introducing a more realistic description of the agents .",
    "this was done through the introduction of certain number of interacting agents , that can know the decisions of their nearest neighbors , before they make their choice . as a result",
    ", the efficiency of the system improves if the fraction @xmath1 of @xmath17 is small , but it is worst when this fraction approaches @xmath56 the relation of the reduced variance @xmath50 with @xmath1 , for @xmath57 resembles the relation of @xmath50 with @xmath36 ; in fact , for every value of @xmath28 there is an optimal value of @xmath1 , @xmath58 , for which one has the minimum value of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , for a small fraction of @xmath59 the system remains in the ptd regime , sweeping through the whole set of histories ; but when this fraction is greater than @xmath60 ( but still within the first , informationally efficient region ) , it falls into a cyclic , and in general non ergodic motion . in this sense , the use of the entropy rate proved to be a sensible tool to study the sequence of histories visited .",
    "we have also studied a related set , by choosing words of length @xmath61 that are _ contiguous _ , but do not share any bit ( one can form @xmath62 words of this kind ) .",
    "we found that the periodic behavior is also detected by this set of words , but its behavior for small values of @xmath1 is not very clear ."
