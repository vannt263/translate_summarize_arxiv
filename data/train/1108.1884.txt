    "the _ dna profile _ of a person is the genetic information at a set of chosen _ markers _ across chromosomes . for each marker , a person has two sequences of dna called _ alleles _ , and the pair of alleles constitute the _ genotype _ of that marker .",
    "when a dna trace is analysed , it is first amplified by a _ polymerase chain reaction _ ( pcr ) , and then the allelic composition of the trace is determined by electrophoresis . for further details , see for example @xcite .",
    "the size of a peak on the corresponding electropherogram is roughly proportional to the amount of the dna in the trace of that particular allelic type .",
    "this quantitative information about the allelic composition becomes particularly important , when analysing mixed traces of dna .",
    "we consider a model for analysing a mixed trace of dna using information about peak sizes for each present allele , as obtained from the electropherogram for that trace .",
    "there is now a substantial body of literature on methods for exploiting this information in the analysis and interpretation of dna mixtures .",
    "early attempts include for example @xcite ; none of these are fully model based but use various summaries of the peak size information to separate contributions into major and minor components .",
    "in addition there are a number of articles using bayesian networks or other variants of graphical models describing the distribution of peak sizes , for example @xcite .",
    "the present paper belongs to the model based paradigm in the latter group of articles .",
    "an important parameter in the analysis of @xcite was a variance factor in the peak size distribution .",
    "there , a fixed value was used for the variance factor across all markers and all cases , although there were signs of sensitivity to the choice of this value .",
    "it was therefore suggested that this parameter should be adapted to each case . in the present paper",
    "we respond to the suggestion by developing methods for simultaneously estimating the variance factor and the unknown mixture proportions for a given trace .",
    "our model is implemented as a bayesian network along the lines described in @xcite . below we summarize some of the main features of the model and its use .      for each allele present in the mixture",
    "the size of the corresponding peak is observed ; the size is represented by the peak area or peak height and possibly corrected for preferential amplification .",
    "a key assumption is that the peak size is roughly proportional to the pre - amplification amount of the corresponding allele @xcite .",
    "we are adopting the gamma model described in @xcite and partly justified in @xcite .",
    "the model assumes a known number of contributors , and for technical simplicity we consider here only cases with two contributors and do not allow for artefacts such as stutter and drop - out .",
    "we also assume that the pre - amplification proportions of dna from the two contributors is constant across markers .",
    "we represent the proportion of dna originating from one of the contributors by @xmath0 ; @xmath0 is then a number between 0 and 1 .    in @xcite it is assumed that , for fixed genotypes of the contributors and a fixed mixture proportion , the peak size @xmath1 of allele @xmath2 at a given marker is independent of peak sizes of other alleles and gamma distributed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a scale parameter , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the number of alleles of type @xmath2 at a given marker in the genotype of each contributor .",
    "thus , for example , if the first contributor has genotype @xmath8 and contributed 40% of the dna , and the second contributor has genotype @xmath9 , then @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and all other @xmath12-s are equal to zero .",
    "hence , in this case @xmath13    at each marker the peak sizes @xmath14 are scaled by their sum such that the resulting _ relative peak sizes _ @xmath15 add up to 1 .",
    "we let @xmath16 denote the total set of observed relative peak sizes for all markers .",
    "then @xmath16 follows a dirichlet distribution .",
    "the relative peak sizes are independent between markers and each @xmath17 follows a beta distribution with mean and variance given as @xmath18 where we have let @xmath19 .",
    "hence @xmath20 is the mean ( relative ) peak size for allele @xmath2 so , for example , in the mixture ( [ eq : mixex ] ) above we would expect the peak at allele @xmath21 to be about four times as large as that at @xmath22 . also , @xmath23 is a measure of the _ generic peak imbalance _ : for a single heterozygous contributor with allele @xmath2 we have @xmath24 and therefore expect two peaks of same size ; the coefficient of variation for one such peak being @xmath25 i.e.  if @xmath26 , say , the standard deviation of such a relative peak area is 7% .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is related to the heterozygote balance ( @xmath28 ) as described in @xcite , i.e.  the ratio between the peak sizes for the two alleles .",
    "the gamma model implies that @xmath28 is @xmath29-distributed . for a case where @xmath26 we get @xmath30 and a 95% prediction interval for @xmath28 would be @xmath31 which conforms well with previous findings @xcite .",
    "based on the relative peak areas and the bayesian network , two key questions can be addressed : a _ mixture deconvolution _ which attempts to determine the dna profiles of the unknown contributors to the mixture , and the calculation of an _ evidential value _ for the comparison of specific hypotheses concerning the composition of the observed mixture .      the dna profiles of the contributors to a mixture can be predicted by a ranked list of most probable profile pairs @xmath32 based on the information in the peak sizes , i.e.  ranking these according to their probabilities @xmath33 .",
    "note that both @xmath0 and @xmath23 are unknown and therefore need to be estimated .",
    "suppose we have a reference profile from an individual which we shall term the _ suspect _ and wish to compare two specific hypotheses @xmath34 and @xmath35 , entertained by the prosecution and defence , for example    1 .",
    "@xmath34 : `` the suspect and one unknown individual has contributed to the trace '' 2 .",
    "@xmath35 : `` two unknown individuals have contributed to the trace '' .",
    "we consider contributors to be unrelated and the unknown individuals drawn at random from a specific population . to assess the strength of the evidence we wish to calculate the likelihood ratio @xmath36 of @xmath34 against @xmath35 : @xmath37 where we again note the dependency of this ratio on the unknown parameters @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "we illustrate the methods using relative peak sizes from two mixtures with partial or complete knowledge of the contributors also used in @xcite , denoted the _",
    "evett _ @xcite and _ perlin _",
    "@xcite data respectively .",
    "the peak sizes are adjusted for preferential amplification by scaling the areas by the repeat number for the corresponding allele .",
    "the evett data ( table  [ tab : evettdata ] ) consists of the relative peak sizes from a mixture in 10:1 ratio with a known profile for the main contributor .",
    "the perlin data ( table  [ tab : perlindata ] ) are from a 7:3 ratio mixture with two known contributors .",
    ".perlin data .",
    "the person with dna profile @xmath38 is the major contributor . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the bayesian analysis reveals the same two profile pairs as the most probable but slightly reverses the ranking of profile pairs with smaller probabilities .",
    "note , though , that the probabilities in table  [ tab : perlinsepmcmc ] are monte carlo estimates with a standard error up to 3% and thus the mutual ranking of profiles with very similar probabilities is uncertain .",
    "in other words , the four most highly ranked configurations are definitely the top four on the list , whereas the mutual ranking of number three and four could be reversed , although this is unlikely . similarly , the correct mutual ranking of the last five could easily be reversed in comparison with the ranking in the table .",
    "in the present article we have demonstrated how both the mixture proportions and the unknown variance factor in the model used by @xcite can be estimated and its uncertainty incorporated into further analysis of the dna trace .",
    "the analysis shows that there is sufficient information in a single trace to do so using only the peak sizes for the data at hand , if the variance factor @xmath23 is taken to be marker independent .",
    "we have illustrated how it is possible to assess the performance of a particular method for a given case .",
    "it would be well worthwhile to carry out a further study on the general performance , for example of the stability of the method for mixture deconvolution .",
    "however , we would like to emphasise that by performing a bootstrap analysis we get an indication of the information that data from mixtures of similar composition would provide about the questions in mind and the bootstrap analyses do indicate a considerable stability of the findings",
    ".    there might be good reasons to believe that the peak imbalance @xmath23 differs across markers . as there is limited information in the data from a single case we have for practical reasons chosen to ignore this variation and use a single @xmath23 for each case .",
    "an alternative way of accommodating marker dependence on the generic variability would be to assume that the parameter @xmath39 in the gamma model ( [ eq : gamma ] ) depends on @xmath40 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 depends only on the case at hand and @xmath43 is marker dependent but independent of the case considered .",
    "one could then use laboratory data to estimate @xmath43 and only adapt @xmath42 to the case .",
    "this methodology would only demand minor technical variations for the bayesian and maximum likelihood methods developed in this paper .",
    "generally , prior information on the total amount of dna would also be available which could be used to improve the bayesian analysis by using an informed prior distribution for @xmath42 .",
    "we have only considered the simplest model with a fixed number of contributors and no artefacts in the form of stutter , dropout , etc .",
    "maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters can still be found extending to the case of multiple contributors , but as there would be more mixture proportions to estimate , larger confidence intervals for the parameter estimates are to be expected .",
    "extensions @xcite involve even more parameters which need to be estimated in a similar way and it certainly adds to the general complexity of the problem , as does issues of gene frequency uncertainties etc .  @xcite . we expect to address these issues in the future .",
