    "light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of hadrons are key ingredients in the description of various exclusive processes of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and their role can be analogous to those of parton distributions in inclusive processes . in terms of bethe - salpeter wave functions",
    "@xmath4 , lcdas @xmath5 are defined by retaining the momentum fractions @xmath6 and integrating out the transverse momenta @xmath7 @xcite . they provide essential information on the nonperturbative structure of the hadron for qcd treatment of exclusive reactions .",
    "specifically , the leading twist lcdas describe the probability amplitudes to find the hadron in a fock state with the minimum number of constituents . in the literature , there have been many nonperturbative approaches to estimate lcdas , such as the qcd sum rules @xcite , lattice calculation @xcite , chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum @xcite , nabmbu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , and the light - front quark model @xcite .",
    "these studies have dealt with lcdas of pseudoscalar @xcite , vector @xcite , axial - vector @xcite , and tensor @xcite mesons .",
    "the fact that @xmath8-physics exclusive processes are under investigation in babar , belle , and lhc experiments also urges the detailed study of hadronic lcdas .",
    "recently , many @xmath0-wave heavy mesons were observed and confirmed .",
    "they include @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of leading twist lcdas of @xmath0-wave heavy mesons which include the scalar , axial - vector , and tensor mesons .",
    "we hope a thorough understanding of their properties , such as lcdas which are universal nonperturbative objects , will be of great benefit when analyzing the hard exclusive processes with heavy meson production .    in the past decade ,",
    "the most significant progress made in the qcd description of hadronic physics was , perhaps , in the avenue of heavy quark dynamics .",
    "the analysis of heavy hadron structures has been tremendously simplified by the heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) proposed by isgur and wise @xcite , and the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) developed from qcd in terms of @xmath18 expansion @xcite .",
    "hqet has provided a systematic framework for studying symmetry breaking @xmath18 corrections ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , in terms of heavy quark expansion , hqet offered a new framework for the systematic study of the inclusive decays of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "however , the general properties of heavy hadrons , namely , their decay constants , transition form factors , structure functions , etc , are still incalculable within qcd , even in the infinite quark - mass limit with the utilization of hqs and hqet .",
    "hence , although hqs and hqet have simplified heavy quark dynamics , a complete first - principles qcd description of heavy hadrons is still lacking due to the unknown nonperturbative qcd dynamics .    in this study , the @xmath0-wave heavy meson",
    "is explored in a light - front quark model ( lfqm ) with both general and heavy quark frameworks .",
    "lfqm is a promising analytic method for solving the nonperturbative problems of hadron physics @xcite , as well as offering much insights into the internal structures of bound states .",
    "the basic ingredient in lfqm is the relativistic hadron wave function which generalizes distribution amplitudes by including transverse momentum distributions ; it contains all the information of a hadron from its constituents .",
    "the hadronic quantities are represented by the overlap of wave functions and can be derived in principle .",
    "the light - front wave function is manifestly a lorentz - invariant , expressed in terms of internal momentum fraction variables which are independent of the total hadron momentum .",
    "moreover , the fully relativistic treatment of quark spins and center - of - mass motion can be carried out using the so - called melosh rotation @xcite .",
    "this treatment has been successfully applied to calculate phenomenologically many important meson decay constants and hadronic form factors @xcite .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of this study is the calculation of the leading twist lcdas of @xmath0-wave heavy mesons within lfqm .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the leading twist lcdas of @xmath0-wave meson states are shown in cases of vector and tensor currents with general and heavy quark frames . in sec .",
    "iii , the formulism of lfqm is reviewed briefly ; then , the leading twist lcdas are extracted within the lfqm . in sec .",
    "iv , numerical results of the decay constants and lcdas are recorded .",
    "the @xmath3 moments of these lcdas are also calculated and presented .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec . v.",
