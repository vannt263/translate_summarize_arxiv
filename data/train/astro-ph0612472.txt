    "astrophysical black holes with masses in the @xmath4@xmath1  range ( intermediate - mass black hole , imbh ) are of significant implications to black hole research and cosmology .",
    "the search for imbhs turns out to be a difficult task , however , since imbhs are beyond the reach of direct dynamical measurement .",
    "the most promising approach is to search for dwarf agns hosted in small galaxies .",
    "so far , convincing evidence for the existence of imbhs has been found in only a dozen agns ( ngc4395 , filippenko & ho 2003 ; pox52 , barth et al .",
    "2004 ; greene & ho 2006 ; sdssj1605 + 1748 , dong et al .",
    "greene & ho ( 2004 , hereafter gh04 ) have conducted a pioneering systematic search for imbh agns from the sdss dr1 over a sky area of 1360 deg@xmath5 , yielding 19 candidates that are preferentially accreting close to the eddington limit ( mainly due to their selection method ) .",
    "a fundamental question remains open whether imbhs are truly rare or they are just mostly quiescent .",
    "to address this and other related questions we have conducted a thorough search for imbh agns using data from the sdss dr4 .",
    "we performed spectral analysis for all the galaxies and qsos with redshift @xmath6 from the sdss dr4 spectroscopic database covering 4783 deg@xmath5 .",
    "starlight and nuclear continuum were subtracted from sdss spectra using the method as described in zhou et al .",
    "emission line spectra were fitted using the code as described in dong et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . based on fitted line parameters , we culled broad - line agns following the criterion as described in dong et al .",
    "black hole masses were estimated from the luminosity and width of a broad h@xmath2 component ( greene & ho 2005 ; greene & ho 2006 ) .",
    "finally , we found 245 broad - line agn with candidate imbhs , sampling the ranges of @xmath7@xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "as noted by gh04 , for imbh agns whose spectrum are dominated by narrow emission lines or which are embedded in a much more luminous host galaxy , weak broad lines are hard to discern ; this is especially true for those in a low accretion state . for the recovery of weak broad lines , accurate decomposition of agn ",
    "galaxy spectra is essential , as well as careful fitting of the lines .",
    "resulting from our algorithms improved in both aspects , we found 36 candidate imbhs with @xmath3 .",
    "figure 2 shows such an example , sdssj112628.73 + 472453.8 ( @xmath10 ) that has @xmath11@xmath1  and @xmath12 . considering the selection effects that is seriously against finding such objects",
    ", we suggest that there might exist a large fraction of imbhs with weak or no agn activity .",
    "this can be examined in future via deriving the @xmath13 distribution of imbh agns ( dong et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "using monte - carlo simulations to handle the various selection effects ( the sdss magnitude limit , starlight dilution , and the broad - line criterion , etc . ) ."
