    "the famous riemann zeta function @xmath3 is a function of a complex variable @xmath1 , for @xmath10 defined by @xmath11 where the letter @xmath12 is a prime number , and the product of @xmath13 is taken over all primes .",

    "it follows from the functional equation ( [ eq : feq ] ) and basic properties of the gamma - function that @xmath3 vanishes in @xmath21 exactly at the so - called trivial zeros @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in 1859",
    ", riemann stated that it seems likely that all nontrivial zeros lie on the so - called critical line @xmath24 .",
