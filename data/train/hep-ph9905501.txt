    "one can perfectly well view @xmath3 decay as arising from the @xmath4 quark - level @xcite linear @xmath5 model ( l@xmath5 m ) instead of through the @xmath6 chiral anomaly @xcite .",
    "in such a description it is straightforward to predict many other @xmath4 radiative decays through quark triangle graphs . the purpose of this paper is to investigate how well this quark loop picture accords with experimental data @xcite ; in this way we avoid discussing anomaly predictions of these processes and notions of strong cp violation with consequential ( low mass ) axions , since these effects have yet to be discovered in the laboratory .",
    "we also consider the situation for rare @xmath4 decays that are associated with tiny quark mixings ( such as @xmath7 ) and with isospin - changing corrections ( such as @xmath8 ) .    in section",
    "ii we show that the dominant l@xmath5 m quark triangle @xmath4 predictions for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 all fit the data , within experimental errors ; the only parameters at our disposal are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the couplings of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons respectively to the quarks , the constituent quark masses @xmath14 and a couple of well - known mixing angles .",
    "we pursue this approach in section iii , for the rarer isospin - conserving interactions where the data gives valuable information about the small amount of admixture of light quarks in the heavy @xmath15 states , and vice versa ; here the agreement is less good , but the experimental information is also sparser and may be expected to change with time . in section iv , we show that a simple picture of @xmath16 meson - meson transitions , associated with the @xmath17 quark mass difference , nicely provides the rates for isospin changing decays .",
    "the last section contains some preliminary work on three - body decays in which at last one pair of pions is produced in a p - state ; we show that @xmath18-meson poles essentially saturate the amplitudes for those processes , given the two - body amplitudes determined previously .",
    "the reasonable agreement between naive theory and experiment suggests that this quark loop picture is a viable alternative to the field - theoretic anomaly - inspired evaluation of such amplitudes .",
    "however the tantalizing picture which emerges is that internal mass dependence of the box diagrams is largely negated by the form factors which must be present at the meson - quark vertices .",
    "such are our conclusions in section vi .",
    "for the past thirty years , the @xmath19 decay has been understood as an @xmath6 chiral anomaly @xcite combined with the partial conservation of axial current ( pcac ) . writing this process and all other @xmath4 amplitudes in the conventional form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 refer to vector particle momentum and polarization respectively ,",
    "one derives @xmath23 with @xmath24 mev and a quark color number @xmath25 , the theoretical result is accurately consistent with data @xcite : @xmath26 the question then arises as to which theoretical models also predict the same result while simultaneously demanding that @xmath27 .",
    "one such favored model is the quark - level @xcite linear @xmath5 model ( l@xmath5 m ) .",
    "this model also provides @xmath28 and @xmath29 quark triangle graphs but with the meson interacting through the pseudoscalar @xmath30 vertex , rather than through the divergence of an axial vector .",
    "no accompanying l@xmath5 m @xmath31 loop is allowed because the @xmath32 coupling vanishes ; consequently the @xmath6 anomaly result immediately follows in the spirit of steinberger @xcite .",
    "( in carrying out the evaluation of @xmath33 , we go to the soft limit , because the pion is essentially massless , relative to other hadronic masses and even the constituent quarks . )",
    "the fact that this l@xmath5 m also demands @xmath34 @xcite is tied to the lee null tadpole condition @xcite and ensures dynamical generation of masses , in contrast to the original nucleon - level l@xmath5 m @xcite .",
    "the pion - quark coupling @xmath35 needed obeys the quark - level goldberger - treiman relation ( gtr ) @xmath36 where the constituent ( nonstrange ) quark mass @xmath37 is dynamically generated to the expected @xmath38 value in the chiral limit , since @xmath39 is required now .",
    "our aim in this paper is to investigate how well the sigma model picture fits the data for @xmath4 processes .",
    "we take the naive viewpoint that the @xmath4 amplitudes , just like @xmath40 can be estimated by working out @xmath41 in the limit of _ zero _ external momentum , even though this is a _ long way _ from the mass shell for the _ heavy _ mesons particularly .",
    "the reason why we do so is because many of these processes are quite close to particle thresholds and would otherwise be highly dependent on binding energies and the like  for which there is no evidence .",
    "in such a soft limit and including the crossed diagram , it is very simple to work out that @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the internal quark masses , in an obvious cyclic notation .",
    "the feynman parametric integral is especially easy to work out when all quark masses are equal to @xmath44 , when @xmath45 it is not much harder to determine the integral ( 3 ) if two masses are equal , say @xmath46 , when @xmath47 thus @xmath48 in the equal mass limit @xmath49 .",
    "see figure 1 to see how @xmath50 varies with @xmath51 .",
    "it only remains to substitute the couplings of the mesons to the quarks in order to derive the theoretical values for @xmath41 .",
    "to do so we will adopt the naive perspective that all strong couplings are related by @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "therefore , in the absence of any isospin breaking and neglecting the third generation of quarks , let us see how far one can go with the effective lagrangian ( suppressing the @xmath30 matrix between spinors ) , @xmath52.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the universal coupling @xmath53 above is fixed by the @xmath54 coupling , which in turn is determined by gtr ; thus @xmath55 .",
    "we must also relate the physical neutral pseudoscalar states to the isospin 0 combinations in eq .",
    "( 4 ) via certain mixings . for the purpose of this and the next section",
    ", we shall disregard electromagnetic effects in the strong sector and take ( see appendix ) @xmath56 with @xmath57 unmixed .",
    "( later on we will examine rare decays , where the small residual mixings become rather important . )",
    "the strong vector meson interactions are likewise written as @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] suppressing vector indices and the @xmath59 matrix between quark spinors . here",
    "the coupling constant is fixed by that of the @xmath18-meson which is itself determined by the leptonic decay rate : @xmath60 .",
    "these vector states also undergo the semistrong mixing via @xmath61 ( at this level we may identify @xmath62 with the @xmath63 particle . ) finally , it is trivial to consider radiative decays , by substituting @xmath59 for the meson and including the proper electromagnetic coupling of the photon to the quarks , @xmath64 .",
    "the magnitudes of the @xmath41 can be found directly from experimental decay rates , as they occur @xcite .",
    "for @xmath65 decays , the rate is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the magnitude of the three - momentum of one of the vector mesons in the rest frame of the decaying @xmath69 .",
    "( we must be careful to multiply the right - hand - side of ( 6 ) by a factor of 1/2 when the two vector mesons are identical . )",
    "a very similar formula applies to the decay rate @xmath70 , @xmath71 where @xmath72 refers to the mass of the initial vector and @xmath73 is the momentum of one final particle in the decay rest frame .",
    "it is then a simple matter to extract the @xmath74 from the measured @xcite rates @xmath75 , for subsequent comparison with theory .",
    "we shall do this constantly , without further elaboration .",
    "we mentioned at the start that the @xmath76 amplitude is theoretically determined in the sigma model by ing the @xmath28 and @xmath29 loop contributions and equals @xmath77 , fitting experiment admirably .",
    "indeed many of the processes involve neutral mesons and require the interaction terms , @xmath78,\\ ] ] @xmath79.\\ ] ] instead of treating each process one at a time , let us consider just three examples to explain what we are doing , before presenting our results for non - rare decays in a table .",
    "consider first the decay @xmath80 , which contains a charge coupling , one vector coupling and one scalar coupling .",
    "the sum of the loops of nonstrange quarks and the mixing angles implied by ( 8) and ( 9 ) gives ( @xmath81 ) @xmath82 using the values quoted previously , we obtain the rough theoretical magnitude , @xmath83 gev@xmath84 , which can be compared with the experimental result , @xmath85 our second example is the semistrong process @xmath86 , which is governed by nonstrange quark loops but is rather sensitive to the vector meson mixing angle @xmath87 .",
    "the theoretical result here is @xmath88 inserting the accepted value of @xmath89 , the prediction is that @xmath90 gev@xmath84 , and this is in agreement with the upper bound obtained by experiment : @xmath91 gev@xmath84 ; in this connection we note that the 1996 pdg compilation @xcite cites a specific value for this particular channel ( which we prefer ) , but this has been retracted in the 1998 pdg compilation , resulting in less predictive power .",
    "finally we take a look at the decay @xmath92 , which is governed by a charm loop and involves one photon .",
    "this time we get @xmath93 which we estimate to be about 0.19 gev@xmath84 , for a constituent quark mass ratio of @xmath94 .",
    "this is close to average experimental value of @xmath95 gev@xmath84 , obtained from the decay rate .    in this manner",
    "we can work out theoretical estimates of all dominant @xmath4 processes .",
    "we have tabulated the results and the experimental magnitudes for comparison in table 1 .",
    "the near agreement of naive theory with data is actually quite astonishing , because we are dealing with sizeable external masses in many instances , particularly for heavy charm quarks , and so are a very long way from the chiral limit .",
    "we will return to this point towards the end of the paper .",
    "it should be noted that the last five decay channels in table i correspond to unequal mass quarks running round the loop , in contrast to all the previous cases , and the absolute value of the amplitudes are perhaps not as impressively predicted are the others ( although the ratio @xmath96 is reasonably close to experiment ) . on the whole",
    "the fit is quite satisfactory , considering the fact that we have no free parameters at our disposal .",
    "there are many processes involving the heavier quarks which conserve isospin .",
    "they tend to be rarer than the cases considered above and measure the smaller admixture of lighter quarks in the meson composites .",
    "in fact these rare processes provide much valuable information about such small mixings and , emboldened by the success of the soft momentum predictions of @xmath4 amplitudes , we shall apply the same method to probe the mixing angles of neutral vectors and pseudoscalars .",
    "let us write the meson which couples to the @xmath97 as the combination @xmath98 where the two @xmath99 are very small quantities ( which is why we have not modified the normalization factor in front of @xmath57 in first approximation ) .",
    "it follows then that the non - strange and strange pseudoscalars are ( in the same limit ) , @xmath100 consequently the interactions ( 8) of the neutral pseudoscalars get modified to @xmath101.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] much the same idea can be applied to the neutral vector interactions ( with mixing parameters @xmath99 replaced by @xmath102 ) : @xmath103.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are now in a position to tackle rare @xmath4 processes involving @xmath57 and @xmath104 .",
    "these are evaluated in the same way as before , but now using the neutral couplings ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table ii ; theoretical values are only worked out to first order in @xmath99 or @xmath102 , since these are already small quantities .",
    "we need to give some words of explanation as to what entry in the last column is being predicted and what is not , in contrast to table i , which is essentially parameter - free . in our parametrizations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , the cleanest predictor of the amount of nonstrange and strange quark components in @xmath57 are the two decays @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; they determine separate combinations of the mixings @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( which represent the amount of charm quarks contained in @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) .",
    "we may derive a reasonable fit by choosing the values @xmath111 and @xmath112 ; this permits us to _ predict _ the decay rates for @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the table . while the latter prediction is good , the former is decidedly not  in fact the experimental value is slightly embarrassing and difficult to understand on any sensible theoretical basis",
    "; for u(2 ) symmetry between @xmath28 and @xmath29 entails that the process @xmath115 should be almost equal to @xmath116 , which is a far cry from what seems to be observed !    with respect to the @xmath102 parameters (",
    "because @xmath87 is so small ) the process @xmath117 tells us about the nonstrange - charm mixing @xmath118 almost at once , while @xmath119 provides the mixing between strange and charm states , namely @xmath120 .",
    "we find a fair fit ( including sign ) with the values , @xmath121 .",
    "this enables us to _ predict _ the amplitudes for the other entries in table ii involving @xmath102 .",
    "they are all roughly correct , except for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we do not understand the reasons for this ; blaming the discrepancy on the effect of mass extrapolation from the shell to zero - momentum would undermine the other reasonable answers ; but in any case it should be noted that the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) prediction is a factor of 250 larger than the data which heightens our suspicions .",
    "it is possible that the experimental results may shift a little over time and bring the results into closer agreement with theoretical expectations , or possibly the experimental decay rate also includes the contribution from @xmath124 .",
    "here we want to take a look at four processes , @xmath125 because they involve isospin breaking interactions of mesons , without being accompanied by photons .",
    "( interestingly , there seems to be no comparable data in the @xmath57 decay sector . )",
    "all four processes are smaller by at least a factor of three compared to processes that conserve isospin ; eg @xmath126",
    ".    we may ascribe the existence of these small amplitudes to electromagnetic effects and the @xmath17 mass difference . with regard to the quark triangle loop ,",
    "the @xmath17 difference gives a correction of order @xmath127 , which is insufficient to explain the observed magnitudes .",
    "we shall find below that the experimental results can be reasonably well obtained by @xmath16 mixings between mesons ( including the well - known @xmath128 transition ) , which are themselves dominated by the @xmath17 difference in quark - loop self - energy contributions .    before going further ,",
    "let us estimate two strong @xmath4 amplitudes that can not be directly measured from decays , because of the masses of the participating mesons ; they are nonetheless important in a subsidiary role for what follows .",
    "firstly , there is the interaction @xmath129 ( which actually enters @xmath130 , via pole dominance ) , that we estimate to be @xmath131 next we shall need the amplitude @xmath132 finally we shall require amplitudes which we have estimated previously fairly well ( or which we can take directly from experiment ) , namely @xmath133 gev@xmath84 , @xmath134 gev@xmath84 and @xmath135 gev@xmath84 .",
    "other quantities we will need are the @xmath136 and @xmath137 elements , where unprimed states refer to @xmath138 composites while primed states correspond to @xmath139 mesons .",
    "these elements include the most well - studied case of the @xmath128 transition , which is the sum of two pieces @xcite : @xmath140 in similar vein , we may estimate the @xmath141 transition to be @xmath142 we must be a little more careful with the @xmath143 transition , which is dominated by the photon exchange contribution @xmath144 : @xmath145 last , but not least , we shall require the @xmath146 and @xmath147 transitions .",
    "this arises from a quark self - energy bubble plus an @xmath148 tadpole term .",
    "the latter equals the former contribution @xcite because @xmath149 by su(6 ) and chiral symmetry @xcite . noting the gap equation @xcite stemming from the gtr , the total result sums to @xmath150\\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & 2(m_u^2-m_d^2 ) \\simeq -5400 { \\rm~mev}^2 \\quad { \\rm for~~ } m_d - m_u\\simeq 4 { \\rm ~mev}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thereby estimate the two neutral pseudoscalar elements , @xmath151 actually the last element leads to very small corrections because each of the mesons is rather far from the mass shell of the other .",
    "we are now in a position to estimate these rare amplitudes .",
    "( remember that we may ignore the negligible correction induced by @xmath17 mass differences within the triangle loop . )",
    "the first case is @xmath152 upon substituting the @xmath16 transition elements found above and the vertex amplitudes determined previously .",
    "similarly , we find @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 the experimental values of these amplitudes , deduced from the measured decay rates , are , in units of gev@xmath84 , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }         these answers are in the `` right ball park '' and we venture to conclude that this @xmath16 , pole - dominated mechanism captures the main features of such feeble decays .",
    "here we shall have a look at a few three - body decays , in which pions are produced in a p - state and are known to be dominated by @xmath18-meson poles ; specifically we shall examine the three processes @xmath157 and @xmath158 to see how well they tie up with the earlier @xmath33 amplitudes . before doing",
    "so we shall require more accurate values of the on - shell couplings @xmath159 .",
    "we recall that the quark loop alone gives @xmath160 and @xmath161 mev@xmath84 .",
    "however , in a sigma model , besides the non - strange quark loop we have to add a meson loop associated with sigma exchange .",
    "the effect of this is to enhance @xcite the value of @xmath162 by a factor of 6/5 , to about 6.1 , which is very close to the experimental value coming from the @xmath18 decay width .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath18-@xmath163-@xmath164 coupling is enhanced @xcite by a factor of ( 6/5)@xmath165 to @xmath166 gev@xmath84 .",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath167 process @xmath130 may be written in the covariant form @xmath168 , where the scalar amplitude @xmath33 is dominated by @xmath18 mesons @xcite in each of the three possible two - body channels : @xmath169\\simeq 1480{\\rm ~gev}^{-3},\\ ] ] in deriving this result , we have averaged over the mandelstam variables : @xmath170 gev@xmath165 . if we then follow thews phase space analysis @xcite , we get @xmath171 with the constant matrix element giving @xmath172 in this way , we predict @xmath173 mev , very close to the observed rate of @xmath174 mev .",
    "our next object of study , @xmath175 , is dominated by a @xmath176 meson pole , but just in the two - pion channel @xcite .",
    "the process also takes the same covariant form as the previous case . here",
    "we estimate @xmath177 upon substituting the @xmath109-@xmath18-@xmath59 amplitude found earlier ( table i ) and going to the soft pion limit .",
    "once more , we find @xmath178 for a phase space factor @xcite of @xmath179 .",
    "the prediction ( 31 ) compares well with the observed rate of @xmath180 ev .",
    "finally we consider the @xmath181 decay .",
    "unlike the previous two examples , the @xmath176 pole is now well within the physical region .",
    "the latest particle data tables state that @xmath182 , including nonresonant contributions ) = @xmath183 kev , whereas our prediction ( see table i ) is that latexmath:[$\\gamma(\\eta'\\rightarrow\\rho\\gamma ) =    strongly suggests that any nonresonant p - wave contact contributions are quite small and that the @xmath18 poles accurately match the data .",
    "incidentally it also confirms that the pseudoscalar mixing angle is @xmath185 , rather than @xmath186 , coupled with the anomaly , as the latter angle gives a rate for @xmath187 which is a factor of 20 less than the observed rate @xcite .",
    "taking stock of the results , we appear to have succeeded in estimating some 34 @xmath188 amplitudes with reasonable accuracy ( see the tables ) barring two or three rare decays involving @xmath110 and @xmath163 mesons  which are themselves extracted from one or two experiments that surely deserve repeating in the future .",
    "the success extended to a few abnormal parity three body decays which are known to be dominated by p - wave pion pairs .",
    "we do not regard the coupling constants @xmath53 and @xmath189 which provide the overall scales to be ` parameters ' , because they are predicted in [ 1 ] or are derived from other processes and have well - established magnitudes ; nor do we think that the quark masses are variables at our disposal , since they are also fixed by other means .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath190 and @xmath87 are parameters but they too can be found through processes other than the ones which we have considered in this paper .",
    "the only ( four ) variables which we were truly able to adjust were the mixing angles describing the non-@xmath191 content of @xmath57 and @xmath104 .",
    "perhaps the most surprising aspect of the analysis is the fact that the amplitudes , which we estimated in the soft limit , have reasonable magnitudes even for external heavy meson @xmath191 composites .",
    "we really did not expect this and we think that the conclusions are rather deep and point to some underlying heavy mass scale , way beyond the usual qcd scale of about 300 mev . to put this deduction into perspective , consider some field - theoretic model which includes meson interactions with spinors ; assume it is renormalizable for definiteness .",
    "then the equation for the proper vertex function @xmath192 ( where @xmath193 is the meson momentum and @xmath194 is the relative fermion momentum ) will take the form @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the appropriate interaction kernel for the model in question , @xmath197 stands for the spinor propagator and @xmath198 is the renormalized contact term . if one specialises to pseudoscalar mesons and ignores fermion dressing for simplicity , the equation has the generic scalar form , @xmath199.\\ ] ] the subscript @xmath193 has been attached to the renormalization constant @xmath200 to remind ourselves that the renormalization procedure is often momentum dependent , although the infinite part of @xmath200 ( or a @xmath201 pole term in the dimensional method ) is of course insensitive to @xmath193 .",
    "the limit as @xmath202 of the equation above is readily taken and describes the meson vertex in the ( off - shell ) soft limit .",
    "if the pseudoscalar field is actually a composite of the fermions , then @xmath200 must vanish on the meson mass shell ( @xmath203 ) in order that the vertex equation reduces to a homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the results which we found indicate that the products of vertex functions and quark propagators running round the loop are rather insensitive to external momentum since they suggest that an amplitude like @xmath204 above depends very little on @xmath193 , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath194-dependence on the right hand side has compensating effects from form factors and propagators .",
    "( it is striking that the propagator denominators would appear to depend sensitively on the binding energy near the constituent threshold @xmath205 in the infrared region of @xmath206 , and there is no sign of this . )",
    "therefore it indicates that @xmath207 depends very little on @xmath193 and that the homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation can very likely be extrapolated to @xmath208 with relatively little change .",
    "our guess is that such loop integrals are really dominated by the ultraviolet region and a mass scale @xmath209 of at least 10 gev  much higher than the standard qcd scale  associated with the ratio @xmath210 .",
    "indeed , the seemingly weak dependence of our results on @xmath193 are the most extraordinary part of this work and trying to understand the issue properly is an exciting avenue of future research ; our discussion above does scant justice to the problem .",
    "this research was supported by the australian research council .",
    "mds appreciates the hospitality of the university of tasmania where a substantial proportion of the research work was carried out .",
    "since we are using quark loops to predict @xmath4 amplitudes involving @xmath109 or @xmath110 pseudoscalar mesons , it is imperative that we determine the most important @xmath211 mixing angle @xmath190 from processes other @xcite than @xmath4 decays .",
    "here we shall consider two other ways of fixing this angle .",
    "first we consider tensor @xmath212 decays , @xmath213 .",
    "given the respective percentage branching ratios , from the pdg tables , @xmath214 , and remembering the @xmath215 phase space , we may deduce the two independent ratios , @xmath216 @xmath217 inserting the known magnitudes @xmath218 mev , into this pair of equations , we may conclude from the first that @xmath219 , and from the second that @xmath220 .",
    "likewise the measured @xmath221 branching ratio of 0.003 requires @xcite @xmath222 .",
    "as well , there are the tensor decays @xmath223 , but then the tensor angle @xmath224 enters the analysis ; yet @xmath225 survives the results of the analysis .",
    "a second way of extracting @xmath190 is through the qcd quark - annihilation diagram , involving at least two gluon exchange .",
    "diagonalization of the ns - s meson mass matrix leads @xcite to the @xmath211 mixing angle , @xmath226^{1/2 } = 41.9^o.\\ ] ] the close agreement between @xmath190 determined by @xmath227 data and qcd theory justifies our use of @xmath185 in tables i and ii .    in the singlet - octet basis ,",
    "the mixing angle @xmath228 is instead given by @xcite @xmath229 @xmath230 thus for the pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath231 , which is midway between the original gell - mann - okubo value of @xmath232 and most recent determinations of @xmath233 . in this connection , it is interesting to compare the quark triangle predictions ,                    both ( a.6ab ) exhibit u(3 ) symmetry in the limit @xmath240 .",
    "however for the actual constituent quark mass ratio ( obtained from the gtr or magnetic moments ) of @xmath241 , the numerical values in ( a.6 ) follow .",
    "note that the anomaly version@xcite estimates @xmath242 via chiral perturbation theory but also finds @xmath243 , which is close to our prediction ; we agree with their justification that @xmath244 being near unity is what one expects if the singlet state and the pion have the same wave function .",
