    "since the discovery of directed flow in pioneering experiments on bevalac @xcite the phenomenon of azimuthal asymmetries has been studied extensively at various beam energies using different types of colliding nuclei . besides the interesting phenomenon of directed flow",
    "two additional signatures of the collective behavior of hadrons have been identified in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) :    \\1 ) _ radial flow _ , existence of which has been clearly established in central collisions @xcite .",
    "recently signature of radial flow in _ non - central _ collisions has been predicted @xcite and most likely also confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) _ elliptic flow _ , which can be oriented orthogonally to the reaction plane ( squeeze - out ) at bevalac energies @xcite or parallel to the reaction plane at ags @xcite or sps @xcite energies . in ni+ni 2gev",
    "/ n experiments orientation of the elliptic flow depends on transverse momentum region of neutral mesons selected for the analysis @xcite .",
    "phenomenon of azimuthal asymmetries is satisfactorily understood as a consequence of collective hydrodynamical behavior of nuclear matter described by the equation of state or as a result of shadowing effect and absorption processes in spectator parts of colliding nuclei .    in this work",
    "we study properties of second - order elliptic flow of final state pions .",
    "we concentrate mainly on anisotropy created in pb+pb 160 gev / n non - central collisions studied recently by na49 collaboration using main tpc @xcite and ring calorimeter @xcite data .    second - order flow oriented parallel to the reaction plane",
    "was predicted in theoretical work of j .-",
    "y.ollitrault @xcite for ultra - relativistic energy domain",
    ". mechanism of in - plane elliptic flow generation @xcite is based on the assumption of thermalization of nuclear matter in the asymmetrical overlapping region of non - centrally colliding nuclei .",
    "this assumption is essential for the existence of different pressure gradients in different directions inside the asymmetrical overlapping region . during the subsequent hydrodynamical evolution different pressure gradients",
    "generate second - order asymmetry in transverse momentum distribution of particles @xcite .",
    "also in the recent theoretical work on elliptic flow at ags energies @xcite an assumption about weak sensitivity of the resulting flow asymmetry to non - equilibrium effects ( in central rapidity region ) is formulated .    in this work",
    "we show that elliptic flow can be generated by rescattering process among produced hadrons ( pions ) without the equilibration in prehadronic or hadronic stage of heavy ion collision .",
    "our study is motivated by results of computer simulation @xcite of the rescattering process in the expanding pion gas created in pb+pb 160 gev / n non - central collisions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly describe our rescattering simulation of the expanding pion gas - the cascus 1.0 model .",
    "main results of the simulation - centrality dependence , @xmath0 dependence , rapidity dependence and the equilibration dependence of the asymmetry are presented in section iii .",
    "the results are compared with experimental data @xcite .",
    "qualitative arguments offering our understanding of the mechanism generating the asymmetry are presented in section iv . at the end of this work a summary of results",
    "is given and short conclusions are drawn .",
    "total number of pions generated in ultrarelativistic pb+pb collisions at sps energy is surprisingly large .",
    "even more than 2500 pions can be generated in a central pb+pb collision at this energy .",
    "number of secondary particles thus exceeds number of primary nucleons in the system . assuming that pions are created in independent nucleon - nucleon collisions the initial transverse momentum and rapidity spectra of produced pions are determined mainly by the dynamics of pion production in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "our rescattering simulation is based on the following scenario : initial state of the pion gas is characterized by momentum and spatial distribution @xmath1 of pions as they are produced in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "as the system evolves positions of pions change naturally due to the classical motion of pions .",
    "momenta of pions can change as well in mutual collisions of pions . as",
    "the size of the cloud of pions increases , spatial density of pions becomes smaller and consequently collisions among pions become rare . at some point collisions",
    "cease at all and momentum distribution of pions is not influenced any more .",
    "pions move then freely on their way to detectors .",
    "thus momentum distribution of pions recorded by detectors is not equal to the original momentum distribution of pions as they were produced in nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "it is changed during rescattering process in the early stage of the pion gas expansion . in next subsection",
    "we give short description of the computer simulation we have performed .",
    "our rescattering model @xcite is similar to the rescattering simulation described by t.j.humanic @xcite .",
    "two additional concepts have been used in our version of rescattering model :    \\1 ) initial state of the pion gas in non - central collisions was generated by cascade program @xcite and    \\2 ) formation time of hadrons @xcite was introduced .",
    "the simulation is performed in cms of the pb+pb collision with time step @xmath2 . in each time",
    "step positions of pions are changed according to the classical equation of motion @xmath3 .",
    "two pions collide when their distance is smaller than critical distance @xmath4 where @xmath5 is isospin averaged elastic pion - pion cross section ( taken from experimental data @xcite ) .",
    "new momenta of pions are determined in cms frame of pion - pion collision using differential cross section of the elastic pion - pion interaction .",
    "then new momenta of pions are transformed back to the global frame of the simulation ( cms of pb+pb system ) .",
    "0.5 cm    3.7pt    0.4 cm    after being created pions are not allowed to participate in mutual interactions for lorentz dilated time interval - the formation time @xmath6 and for interaction delay time @xmath7 after each collision .",
    "formation time @xmath8 influences expansion of the pion gas mainly in the initial stage of time evolution , interaction time @xmath7 suppresses unphysical effects of rescattering simulations @xcite and allows to influence total number of collisions in the pion gas .    since no collective behavior of primary nucleons is incorporated in cascade generator @xcite and since the production of pions in primary nucleon - nucleon collisions is azimuthally isotropic the initial state of the pion gas is azimuthally isotropic in momentum space also in the case of non - central collisions :    @xmath9    here @xmath10 denotes azimuthally asymmetrical and @xmath11 denotes azimuthally symmetrical distribution in transverse plane . during the pion gas expansion symmetrical @xmath12 distribution",
    "is changed by mutual collisions of pions .",
    "first results of our simulation ( centrality dependence of the asymmetry ) have been presented during heavy ion workshop on particle physics ( september 1996 ) in slovakia @xcite .",
    "detailed description of the simulation can be found in thesis @xcite . in following subsections we present additional results of the rather extensive simulation",
    "we have performed .",
    "rescattering simulation was performed for random and unknown orientations of the reaction plane in events generated by cascade program @xcite . during the subsequent analysis impact parameter orientation had been determined for each event @xcite and histograms of azimuthal distributions of pions had been filled ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "azimuthal asymmetry of second order oriented in the reaction plane ( not present in the initial state of the pion gas ) had been clearly identified in transverse momentum distribution of pions after the rescattering process .",
    "0.7 cm    1.7pt    0.4 cm strength of the asymmetry was evaluated by fit to the function : @xmath13 \\label{s2}\\ ] ] in next subsections we present main properties of the asymmetry found .",
    "events with impact parameter @xmath14fm generated by cascade program @xcite have been used as input for the rescattering program and subsequently analyzed for second - order asymmetry .",
    "following behavior had been found for different values of rescattering model parameters @xmath15 :    0.7 cm    = 7.5 cm    1.7pt    0.4 cm    asymmetry increases with impact parameter up to the region @xmath169 - 10@xmath17 and then it decreases .",
    "this behavior has been predicted in the work of j .- y .",
    "ollitrault @xcite and it is in remarkable agreement with experimental data @xcite . from the point of view of rescattering simulation centrality dependence of the asymmetry can be understood easily . for @xmath18 initial conditions",
    "have cylindrical symmetry and there is therefore no reason for the asymmetry in the final state .",
    "for very peripheral collisions interactions of pions are very rare due to low multiplicity of pions .",
    "therefore asymmetry is expected to decrease for peripheral collisions .",
    "sizeable asymmetry is generated in the intermediate region where spatial asymmetry in the initial state and number of pion - pion collisions are sufficiently large .",
    "shape of the centrality dependence is not very sensitive to the number of collisions per pion in the expanding pion gas ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "we find also to be surprising , that the asymmetry is generated in the case of small number of collisions per pion ( e.g 0.5 collision per pion ) .",
    "dependence of the strength of asymmetry on the equilibration of the pion gas is studied at the end of this section .",
    "now we present results on @xmath0 and rapidity dependence of the asymmetry .",
    "transverse momentum dependence of the asymmetry has been identified in our results already in the early stage of this work @xcite .",
    "it has been studied quantitatively for different values of rescattering program parameters @xmath15 .",
    "100 events with impact parameter @xmath19 have been used for this analysis .",
    "selected results are presented in fig.4 .",
    "0.7 cm    1.7pt    0.4 cm    the asymmetry increases with @xmath0 for number of collisions per pion @xmath20 in rough agreement with experimental data @xcite . for @xmath21 the shape of the @xmath0 dependence changes together with absolute strength of the asymmetry .",
    "decrease of the asymmetry strength at large @xmath0 for @xmath22 can be understood easily .",
    "high @xmath0 pions can escape from the pion gas volume without interaction due to large value of lorentz - dilated formation time @xmath23 and also due to their larger velocity .",
    "therefore smaller asymmetry is generated for rarely colliding high-@xmath0 pions while larger asymmetry is generated for colliding low-@xmath0 pions .",
    "decrease of the asymmetry in case @xmath24 in comparison with @xmath25 is discussed in section * d*.    detailed comparison of @xmath0 dependence of asymmetry with experimental data may allow to determine physical parameters incorporated in the simulation ( in particular the formation time ) .    for this goal however",
    "improvements in our rescattering model ( e.g. dynamics of @xmath7 delay parameter ) and also higher statistics of experimental data @xcite would be necessary .",
    "rapidity dependence of the asymmetry has been studied using @xmath19 events sample .",
    "resulting rapidity dependence found by our simulation exhibits maximum at distance @xmath26 from central rapidity region .",
    "we find to be interesting that results on rapidity dependence of elliptic flow presented during quark matter 97 conference @xcite also exhibit decrease of the asymmetry strength at mid - rapidity region .    0.7 cm    = 7.3 cm    1.7pt    0.4 cm",
    "this result is worth of further investigation .",
    "it is not excluded that the origin of the mid - rapidity decrease of the asymmetry is related to behavior studied in the next subsection .",
    "numerical value of the rescattering model parameters ( see fig.1 ) allows to influence total number of collisions in the expanding pion gas .",
    "we have studied dependence of the asymmetry on total number of collisions in the pion gas for the set of @xmath19 events .",
    "following result has been obtained ( fig.6 ) :    with increasing number of collisions in the pion gas the asymmetry first increases , it exhibits maximum close to @xmath27 region and then it decreases .",
    "this decrease depends mainly on number of collisions per pion , it is not a consequence of the physics of formation time @xmath8 or interaction time @xmath7 parameter .",
    "both @xmath28 and @xmath29 combinations lead to decrease of asymmetry from @xmath30 level ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "this result can be interpreted as a non - equilibrium feature of the mechanism generating the asymmetry .",
    "we think that monotonic increase and saturation should be expected if the asymmetry were generated in an equilibrium process .",
    "0.7 cm    = 7.8 cm    1.7pt    0.4 cm    for high number of collision per pion @xmath31 the asymmetry seems to saturate .",
    "we guess this corresponds to hydrodynamical limit studied in work @xcite .    at this point",
    "we can try to understand the decrease of asymmetry at mid - rapidity found in our simulation ( fig.5 ) and present also in experimental data @xcite .",
    "the decrease can be explained as a consequence of smaller number of collisions per pion ( @xmath32 ) at midrapidity in comparison with number of collisions per pion at the maximum of rapidity dependence .",
    "this point requires further and more careful study since the position of the maximum is different in our results and experimental data @xcite .",
    "numerical simulation of the pion gas expansion allows us to study also quantities which can not be accessed from final stage of the pion gas .",
    "we have studied time evolution of the number of collisions in the pion gas together with the time evolution of second - order asymmetry . for the sake of simplicity",
    "the asymmetry has been characterized by @xmath33 parameter :    @xmath34    which does not require the fit procedure for its evaluation .    from results shown in fig.7",
    "we conclude that the asymmetry is generated during the early stage of the expansion .",
    "this confirms our conjecture that the asymmetry can originate during pre - equilibrium stage of the pion gas expansion .",
    "theoretical understanding of mechanism the asymmetry is generated by is presented in next section",

    "expansion of the interacting pion gas can be described by kinetic equation @xcite which ( in the case of zero external macroscopic field ) takes the form :    @xmath35_{coll } \\label{kinet}\\ ] ]    @xmath36_{coll}$ ] is the collision ( or scattering ) term describing influence of pion - pion collisions on distribution function @xmath37 .    in slightly simplified case ( we do not take into account time interval during which pions are produced ) our initial state of the pion gas - eq.([psixpt ] )",
    "can be written in the form :    @xmath38    where again @xmath39 denotes asymmetrical spatial distribution of pions in transverse plane and @xmath40 is symmetrical distribution of pions in transverse momentum . during the process of pion gas expansion asymmetry in spatial distribution of pions ",
    "leaks  into momentum distribution of pions which becomes asymmetrical in transverse momentum space .",
    "this phenomenon results from mutual interactions of pions in the expanding asymmetrical volume .",
    "if there were no collisions of pions , momentum distribution of pion gas ( momenta of pions ) would be unchanged .",
    "this is clear intuitively and it can be seen also on analytical level after the integration of kinetic equation ( [ kinet ] ) in spatial coordinates and after the subsequent time integration :    @xmath41 d^3xdt \\label{kint}\\ ] ]    here distribution @xmath42 is distribution of pions in momentum space . since original momentum distribution of pions @xmath43 is symmetrical in @xmath44 plane ( our initial condition ) and since resulting distribution @xmath45 is asymmetrical ( this distribution is measured by detectors ) the collision integral @xmath46d^3\\!\\ ! xdt $ ] must be asymmetrical .",
    "asymmetry of collision integral in eq.([kint ] ) originates from the asymmetrical spatial distribution of pions in transverse plane .",
    "we do not attempt to evaluate the collision integral here though we guess this is accomplishable task .",
    "the asymmetry of the collision integral can be understood intuitively using toy model of pion gas expansion described in the previous paper @xcite . in next section",
    "we derive formalism of two point decomposition of source which ( we think ) allows to study the asymmetry theoretically .",
    "let us consider two point - like sources of pions separated by distance @xmath47 in transverse plane .",
    "each source radiates pions with random azimuthal angle and ( for simplicity ) with fixed absolute value of momentum .",
    "if we switch off rescattering of pions emitted from these two sources azimuthal distribution of pions observed in a distant detector surrounding the source ( @xmath48 ) is constant - symmetrical .",
    "however if collisions of pions are allowed the resulting distribution of pions is asymmetrical in transverse momentum plane .",
