    "the observation of neutrino oscillations in solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino data ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) has unequivocally established that at least two of the three active neutrinos have a non - zero mass and that individual lepton flavor is violated .",
    "this provides a conclusive experimental evidence for the existence of some new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , and therefore , a precise understanding of the neutrino mass mechanism is an important step in unraveling the nature of new physics .",
    "the minimal renormalizable extension of the sm to explain the observed smallness of neutrino masses is the _ neutrino portal _ , defined by the lagrangian @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 are the @xmath17 lepton and higgs doublets respectively , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the second pauli matrix ) is the hypercharge conjugate of @xmath16 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the charge conjugation matrix ) denotes the charge conjugate field and @xmath22 are sm gauge - singlet neutral fermions , usually known as the sterile neutrinos , since they can talk to the sm sector only via their mixing with the active neutrinos . in eq .",
    ", @xmath23 are the dimensionless complex yukawa couplings which , after the electroweak symmetry breaking , yield a dirac mass matrix @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the higgs vacuum expectation value . in addition , eq .   allows a majorana mass term @xmath26 , since the sterile neutrinos carry no sm gauge charge . the existence of these new interactions in eq",
    ".   leads to the following neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis @xmath27 : @xmath28 the active - sterile neutrino mixing is parametrized by @xmath29 . in our subsequent discussion",
    ", we often denote the elements of this matrix as @xmath30 ( see section  [ sec:2 ] for details ) . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the light neutrino masses and mixing are given by the diagonalization of the effective mass matrix @xmath32 whereas the heavy neutrino masses are of order @xmath26 .",
    "this is known as the type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is evident that there are two key aspects of the seesaw mechanism that can be probed experimentally : the majorana mass @xmath26 of the sterile neutrinos and their mixing @xmath30 with the active ones .",
    "the majorana nature of both active and sterile neutrinos can in principle be probed via the lepton number violating ( lnv ) low - energy process of neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "however , an observation of @xmath33 does not necessarily probe the active - sterile mixing @xmath30 , since these mixing effects may not always give the dominant contribution over purely left - or right - handed contributions to the @xmath33 process ; for a review , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a non - negligible value of @xmath30 can be indirectly inferred from non - unitarity of the light neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite as well as in observables for lepton flavor violation ( lfv )  @xcite , lepton non - universality and electroweak precision tests  @xcite . however , these low - energy observables by themselves do not prove the majorana nature of neutrinos since models with pseudo - dirac neutrinos can also give rise to large non - unitarity and lfv effects  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the direct collider searches for heavy neutrinos at the energy frontier can provide a _ simultaneous _ probe of both the aspects of the seesaw mechanism , i.e. the majorana nature of the heavy neutrinos @xmath2 and their mixing with the active neutrinos , provided the seesaw scale is accessible to the available center of mass energy ; for a review , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in particular , electroweak - scale heavy neutrinos can be produced on - shell at colliders with a cross section depending on the strength of their mixing with the active neutrinos in the minimal setup , while their subsequent decay pattern is governed by whether they are majorana or dirac particles . at a hadron collider , the ` smoking gun ' collider signal for heavy _",

    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) on the possibility of a future lepton collider , such as ilc  @xcite , fcc - ee  @xcite , clic  @xcite , cepc  @xcite and muon collider  @xcite , it is worthwhile examining the prospects of heavy neutrino searches in the clean , almost background - free environment of a lepton collider .",
    "we recall that for heavy neutrino masses below the @xmath40-boson threshold , using their possible production in the @xmath40-boson decay @xmath41 or @xmath42  @xcite , and its subsequent neutral current ( nc ) or charged current ( cc ) decays , 95% c.l .",

    "proposed fixed - target experiments such as ship  @xcite can also dramatically improve the limits on @xmath35 , though only in the low - mass range between 0.5 and 10 gev or so .    for heavy neutrino masses above the @xmath40-boson threshold ,",
    "a direct search was performed in @xmath0 annihilation at lep  @xcite , where a single heavy neutrino can be produced via its mixing with active neutrinos : @xmath4  @xcite , and can subsequently decay via cc , nc or yukawa interactions with the sm @xmath44 , @xmath40 or higgs ( @xmath45 ) boson respectively : @xmath46 .",
    "concentrating on the decay channel @xmath47 with @xmath48 jets , which would lead to a single isolated electron plus hadronic jets and missing energy , the l3 collaboration put a 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the mixing parameter @xmath7 in a heavy neutrino mass range between 80 and 205 gev  @xcite .",
    "similar limits were derived recently  @xcite using the aleph data on @xmath49  @xcite . however , these searches were kinematically limited by the maximum center - of - mass energy @xmath50 gev at lep2 . it is expected that future lepton colliders can significantly improve the sensitivity and extend the limits to higher heavy neutrino masses for both dirac and majorana cases .",
    "this is explicitly demonstrated here for the most promising channel @xmath51 and not just the transverse component , as in the case of a hadron collider . ] by performing a monte carlo simulation at @xmath52 and 500 gev ilc , including realistic detector effects and background estimates .",
    "we have used both cut - based and multivariate analysis ( mva ) techniques to derive the projected sensitivity limits for a generic ilc detector  @xcite .",
    "we find that a light - heavy mixing of @xmath7 down to @xmath8 can be probed at 95% c.l .",
    "for the heavy neutrino mass up to @xmath9 gev or so at @xmath10 gev ilc with @xmath11 integrated luminosity .",
    "although for concreteness , we have performed our simulations for the ilc benchmark parameters , this study is also relevant in the context of other future lepton and photon colliders  @xcite .",
    "note that neither the existing lep search channels @xmath51 nor @xmath53 have lnv final states , and hence , it is not evident from these channels whether the heavy neutrinos are majorana particles , as predicted by the usual seesaw mechanism . in principle",
    ", the majorana or dirac nature of the heavy neutrinos could be determined to some extent from the @xmath51 mode using the distribution of the polar angle between the produced neutrino and the incoming electron  @xcite .",
    "here , we propose an alternative clean way to determine the majorana nature using a new lnv signal at @xmath0 colliders within the minimal seesaw : @xmath54 with same - sign dilepton plus four hadronic jets .",
    "noting that the sm background for this process is extremely small , we perform a detailed detector - level simulation for the signal sensitivity and find that the detection of 10 signal events for a mixing parameter @xmath55 would require an integrated luminosity of at least @xmath56 , which is within reach of next generation lepton colliders .    for completeness",
    ", we also present the heavy neutrino production cross sections for various other subdominant processes , such as the higgsstrahlung process @xmath57 and the dominantly photon - mediated processes @xmath58 .",
    "we could also have the processes @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with a real photon coming from the electron or positron beam .",
    "these processes are of direct relevance for an electron - photon collider  @xcite .",
    "finally , taking advantage of the fact that it is possible to switch the beam configuration of an @xmath0 machine from @xmath0 to an @xmath1 mode  @xcite , one can also look for an lnv signal in the process @xmath61 mediated by a @xmath37-channel majorana neutrino  @xcite .",
    "we make a detailed detector - level analysis of this lnv signal and find that due to negligible sm background for this process , it offers an interesting alternative way to probe lnv in the electron sector , even though the cross section is suppressed by @xmath62 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we discuss various possible production modes of the heavy neutrino at a lepton collider . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we do a detailed event analysis using the cut - based techniques for the signal and background involving the final states with @xmath3 and @xmath63 at the @xmath0 collider and the lnv @xmath64 final state at the @xmath1 collider . in section  [ sec:4 ] , we present an mva to further enhance the signal sensitivity for the most promising channel with @xmath3 final state .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "in the minimal seesaw scenario , where the heavy neutrinos do not carry any gauge charge , the only way for them to communicate with the sm sector is through their mixing with the active neutrinos , as governed by the seesaw lagrangian  . to parametrize the light - heavy neutrino mixing , we first diagonalize the full neutrino mass matrix given in eq .   by a unitary mixing matrix : @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 ) are respectively the light and heavy neutrino mass eigenvalues .",

    "for our subsequent discussion , we use a model - independent phenomenological approach , parametrized by a single heavy neutrino mass scale @xmath26 , assuming that any other heavy neutrinos present in the system are sufficiently heavy and do not affect our analysis .",
    "henceforth , we denote the light - heavy mixing parameter simply as @xmath30 , without explicitly writing the heavy neutrino flavor index .",
    "this enables us to derive generic collider exclusion / sensitivity limits in the @xmath85 parameter space , without referring to any particular low - scale seesaw model - building aspects .    from and",
    ", we see that the cross section of heavy neutrino production in @xmath0 collision will be proportional to the mixing parameter @xmath86 , where @xmath87 or 4 , depending on the process considered ( see below ) .",
    "similarly , for the two - body decays of the heavy neutrino to the sm final states @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( if kinematically allowed ) , the corresponding partial decay widths are also proportional to @xmath35 : @xmath91 note that the total decay width for a heavy majorana neutrino will be twice the sum of the partial decay widths shown in eqs .  - , after taking into account the charge conjugate processes .",

    "<S> we discuss the future prospects of heavy neutrino searches at next generation lepton colliders . in particular , we focus on the planned electron - positron colliders , operating in two different beam modes , namely , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the @xmath0 beam mode , we consider various production and decay modes of the heavy neutrino ( @xmath2 ) , and find that the final state with @xmath3 , arising from the @xmath4 production mode , is the most promising channel . however , since this mode is insensitive to the majorana nature of the heavy neutrinos , we also study a new production channel @xmath5 , which leads to a same - sign dilepton plus four jet final state , thus directly probing the lepton number violation in @xmath0 colliders . in the @xmath1 beam mode , we study the prospects of the lepton number violating process of @xmath6 , mediated by a heavy majorana neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> we use both cut - based and multivariate analysis techniques to make a realistic calculation of the relevant signal and background events , including detector effects for a generic linear collider detector . </S>",
    "<S> we find that with the cut - based analysis , the light - heavy neutrino mixing parameter @xmath7 can be probed down to @xmath8 at 95% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> for the heavy neutrino mass up to @xmath9 gev or so at @xmath10 gev with @xmath11 of integrated luminosity . for smaller </S>",
    "<S> mixing values , we show that a multivariate analysis can improve the signal significance by up to an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> these limits will be at least an order of magnitude better than the current best limits from electroweak precision data , as well as the projected limits from @xmath12 tev lhc . </S>"
