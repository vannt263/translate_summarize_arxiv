    "radio sources have allowed the identification of luminous galaxies out to extremely high redshifts . optical / near  ir campaigns during the past few years by several groups",
    "have resulted in the discovery of numerous radio galaxies at @xmath10 , including 20 with @xmath1 , and 3 with @xmath11 ( see de breuck 1998 , this volume ) . at lower redshifts powerful radio sources",
    "are consistently identified with giant elliptical and cd galaxies , suggesting that at high redshifts we may be observing these massive galaxies in their early stages of evolution . while recently developed techniques of finding very distant star  forming galaxies are yielding substantial ` normal ' galaxy populations at @xmath12 ( steidel 1996 ; dickinson 1998 ) , radio galaxy samples remain the best means of finding , and studying , the most massive galaxies at the highest redshifts . in ` traditional ' models such galaxies",
    "are thought to form early ( @xmath13 ) , while in  hierarchical models this process is thought to take much longer (  kauffmann and charlot 1998 ) .",
    "observations of hzrgs may therefore provide a unique opportunity to study massive forming galaxies at the highest redshifts and may help discriminate between these two very different cosmogonies .",
    "we discuss the results of our near  ir imaging program with the w.  m.  keck telescope i to investigate the morphological evolution of hzrgs between @xmath0 , and a detailed study of one of these objects ( 4c41.17 at @xmath7 ) to determine the nature of its radio  aligned continuum using the hubble space telescope ( continuum and emission line imaging ) and the w.  m.  keck telescope ii ( spectroplarimetry ) .",
    "we adopt h@xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , q@xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the assumed cosmology implies a angular size scale of 13@xmath1814 kpc arcsec@xmath15 for the redshift range @xmath19 covered .",
    "for q@xmath20 the corresponding angular size scale is 14% ",
    "33% less at these redshifts .",
    "near - infrared , 0.4- 0.7seeing images obtained with the w.  m.  keck i telescope of hzrgs with @xmath0 show strong morphological evolution at _ rest  frame optical _ ( @xmath21 ) wavelengths ( van breugel 1998 ; figure 1 ) . at the highest redshifts , @xmath1 , the rest  frame visual morphologies exhibit structure on at least two different scales : relatively bright , compact components with typical sizes of @xmath810  surrounded by large  scale ( @xmath8 50 @xmath18 100 ) diffuse emission .",
    "the brightest components are often aligned with the radio sources , and their _ individual _ luminosities are @xmath4 to @xmath22 for comparison , present ",
    "epoch l@xmath23 galaxies and , perhaps more appropriately , ultraluminous infrared starburst galaxies , have , on average , @xmath24 .",
    "total , integrated _ rest  frame b ",
    "band luminosities are @xmath25 magnitudes more luminous than present epoch @xmath26 galaxies .",
    "the presence of radio  aligned optical features suggests a causal connection with the agn .",
    "the most popular explanations for such an alignment effect , which is most prominent at rest ",
    "frame uv wavelengths , include induced star formation , nebular continuum emission , or scattered light from a hidden quasar . at @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( dey , this volume ; cimatti , this volume ) the presence of strongly polarized light is evidence in support of the latter .",
    "however , deep keck spectropolarimetry of two @xmath1 radio galaxies shows that at these higher redshifts the light may be dominated by hot young stars ( see section below ; and dey , this volume ) .    at lower redshifts , @xmath2 , the rest ",
    "frame optical morphologies become smaller , more centrally concentrated , and less aligned with the radio structure .",
    "galaxy surface brightness profiles for the @xmath2 hzrgs are much steeper than those of at @xmath1 .",
    "we attempted to fit the @xmath2 surface brightness profiles with a de vaucouleurs r@xmath29 law and with an exponential law , the forms commonly used to fit elliptical and spiral galaxy profiles , respectively .",
    "we demonstrate the fitting for our best resolved object at @xmath2 , 3c 257 at @xmath30 ( figure 1 ) . within the limited dynamical range of the data , both functional forms fit the observed profiles",
    " neither is preferred .",
    "interestingly , despite this strong morphologicsl evolution the @xmath31 ` hubble ' diagram for the most luminous radio galaxies remains valid even at the highest redshifts , where a large fraction of the k - band continuum is due to a radio  aligned component ( see de breuck , this volume ) .",
    "4c41.17 at @xmath7 was one of the first truly hzrgs discovered ( chambers 1990 ) .",
    "previous observations with the aberrated hst showed that the optical continuum of 4c41.17 is very clumpy and aligned with the inner radio source ( miley 1992 ) .",
    "much improved observations were subsequently obtained with the refurbished hst , including a deep rest ",
    "frame uv image ( f702w filter , @xmath32 @xmath8 1430  ; 6.0 hrs exposure ) , and a image ( lrf filter at @xmath33 5830  ; 2.0 hrs exposure ) .",
    "one of the field objects in the hst images was also seen at near  ir ( graham 1994 ; object # 16 ) and radio wavelengths ( carilli 1994 ) .",
    "this was used to align the hst and radio frames with an estimated relative accuracy of @xmath8 0.1 .",
    "the central , radio  aligned uv and emission is shown in figure 2 with the 0.21resolution radio x - band image from carilli overlaid .",
    "figure 3 shows the hst continuum image of the entire 4c41.17 system smoothed to 0.3resolution to enhance low surface brightness features .",
    "the star formation rates ( @xmath34 ) of the various components as deduced from the rest ",
    "frame uv hst photometry are listed in table 1 .",
    "we have assumed l@xmath35 @xmath15 for a @xmath34 = 1 /yr ( conti 1996 ) and no dust reddening ( which is surely a lower limit , given the detection of dust at sub ",
    "mm wavelengths in 4c41.17 by dunlop 1994 ) .",
    "knaw.tab1      the hst images show that the 4c41.17 system consists of two components : 4c41.17-north with a bright string of uv knots and emission along the radio axis , and 4c41.17-south with several much fainter knots , distributed in random fashion throughout a low surface brightness halo . the brightest radio knot in 4c41.17-north",
    "is associated with the brightest uv knot and arc - like emission .",
    "downstream from this knot ( nee , table 1 ) the radio source curves towards a faint , very steep spectrum ne lobe ( see carilli 1994 ) , while upstream ( ne , table 1 ) from this knot , towards the central radio core , the uv continuum appears edge  brightened .",
    "these morphological features suggest a strong interaction between the radio jet and dense ambient gas and , in fact , are as expected in jet  induced star formation models where sideways shocks induce starformation in the dense medium of forming galaxies ( de young 1989 ; bicknell 1998 ) .      the entire 4c41.17 system is embedded in a common halo of diffuse , low surface brightness emission which extends over a very large area of 54@xmath36  kpc @xmath37 76@xmath36  kpc ( 5@xmath37 7 ) .",
    "this includes a faint region , 4c41.17-south , with half a dozen compact knots distributed in random fashion .",
    "spectroscopic observations have shown that 4c41.17-south is indeed at the same redshift as 4c41.17-north ( dey 1999 ) .",
    "the range of uv luminosities and @xmath34 rates for the individual knots in 4c41.17-south is lower than in 4c41.17-north , and very similar to the ` normal ' ( radio - quiet ) lyman - break galaxies discovered by steidel ( 1996 ) .",
    "the random distribution and on average lower @xmath34 in the 4c41.17-south knots suggests that star formation here is unaided by bowshocks from the radio jet .",
    "the keck near - ir images have shown that the entire 4c41.17 system ( north + south ) has a very blue ( line - free ) continuum , with @xmath38 in a 3circular aperture ( graham 1994 ) . from these same data",
    "we have estimated that 4c41.17-south itself may even be bluer , with @xmath39 in a 1.9circular aperture .",
    "such colors are commonly found for galaxies in the @xmath40 range , and are thought to indicate ongoing star formation ( see for example eisenhardt and dickinson 1992 [ b2 0902 + 34 ] ; steidel 1996 [ ` ly - break ' galaxies ] ) . in 4c41.17-south perhaps as much as 80% of the continuum is due to low surface brightness emission so that , on the basis of its blue colors , it appears that star formation occurs not only in compact , kpc - sized starbursts , but also throughout the 4c41.17-south region , and indeed perhaps the entire 4c41.17 system .",
    "the total integrated uv luminosity of 4c41.17 , over a region approximately 60   in diameter and including the compact and low surface brightness regions , then implies a total sfr of at least @xmath8 660 /yr ( table 1 ) . of this",
    "perhaps as much as 2/3 of the star formation may be occuring in the inter - knot regions .",
    "if the total star formation would continue at this rate for @xmath41 yrs an entire massive elliptical galaxy of @xmath42 might be assembled between @xmath43 and @xmath28 , consistent with the morphological evolution for hzrgs seen in the near  ir keck observations ( section 2 ) .",
    "the hst observations of 4c 41.17 thus seem to suggest that the formation of massive ellipticals might occur on two different length scales .",
    "one in which relatively dense , @xmath44 kpc - sized star forming regions evolve separately and then merge , and one which involves star formation on a very much larger ( @xmath45 ) scale",
    ". the latter may be more dissipative in nature , as suggested by huge ( @xmath8 200 kpc ) , turbulent and possibly slowly rotating halo centered on 4c 41.17 ( chambers 1990 ; dey 1999 ) .",
    "quite possibly the star formation on these small and large scales proceeds on different time scales and with different mass functions . as earlier suggested by kormendy ( 1989 ) , hybrid galaxy formation models , involving both dissipationless merging of stellar systems and of dissipative collapse ,",
    "may be needed to understand the formation of very massive galaxies .",
    "the deep spectropolarimetric observations with the keck ii telescope by dey ( 1997 ) have provided strong evidence in support of the jet  induced star formation model for 4c41.17-north suggested above on the basis of the hst and radio morphologies .",
    "these observations showed that the bright , radio  aligned rest  frame uv continuum is unpolarized ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this implies that scattered agn light , which is generally the dominant contributor to the rest - frame uv emission in @xmath47 radio galaxies , is unlikely to be a major component of the uv flux from 4c 41.17 .",
    "instead , the total light spectrum shows absorption lines and p  cygni  like features that are similar to those detected in the spectra of the recently discovered population of star forming galaxies at slightly lower ( @xmath48 ) redshifts ( fig 4 ) .",
    "the detection of the s v@xmath49 stellar photospheric absorption line , the shape of the blue wing of the si iv profile , the unpolarized continuum emission , the inability of other agn  related processes to account for the uv continuum flux , and the overall similarity of the uv continuum spectra of 4c 41.17 and the nearby star forming region ngc 1741b strongly suggest that the light from 4c 41.17 is dominated by young , hot stars .",
    "the presence of radio  aligned features in many of the @xmath1 hzrgs suggests , by analogy to 4c41.17 , that jet ",
    "induced star formation may be a common phenomenon at these very high redshifts .",
    "we thank g.  bicknell and m.  dopita for stimulating discussions about jet  induced star formation models , s.  rawlings for advance information regarding 6c  0140 + 326 and 8c  1435 + 635 and his work on the @xmath31 diagram , and c.  carilli for providing high quality radio images of 4c41.17 which allowed to improve on the relative radio / optical astrometry for this source .",
