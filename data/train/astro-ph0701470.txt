    "4u  1820303  is one of the most remarkable low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "this ultracompact binary consists of an @xmath2@xmath3 he white dwarf secondary ( rappaport et al .",
    "1987 , hereafter r87 ) accreting via roche - lobe overflow onto a neutron star ( of the mass @xmath4 ) .",
    "its binary period is as short as @xmath5 s ( stella , priedhorsky & white 1987 ; anderson et al .",
    "1997 ) . a likely scenario for the formation of 4u  1820303  appears to be a direct collision of a neutron star and a giant ( verbunt 1987 ; ivanova et al .",
    "2005 ) in its parent globular cluster ngc 6624 .",
    "this resulted in a binary consisting of the neutron star and the stripped giant core , which then cooled down to the present relatively degenerate state ( r87 ) .",
    "the secondary has to have a very low h abundance in order to fit its roche lobe ( r87 ) , and the occurence of type - i x - ray bursts implies that it can not be made of elements heavier than he .",
    "interestingly , 4u",
    "1820303  was the first x - ray burster identified with a known x - ray source ( grindlay et al .",
    "the most likely distance to the source appears to be @xmath6 kpc ( kuulkers et al .",
    "2003 ) , as discussed in a companion paper ( zdziarski et al .  2007 , hereafter z07 ) .",
    "the accretion occurs as a consequence of the loss of the angular momentum of the binary via emission of gravitational radiation ( paczyski 1967 ) , as proposed for this system by stella et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and verbunt ( 1987 ) , and calculated in detail by r87 .",
    "the implied present mass - loss rate from the secondary ( r87 ; see section [ flow ] below ) is completely compatible with that corresponding to the average isotropic bolometric luminosity measured from the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) data by z07 .",
    "this provides a strong support for this accretion model .",
    "the present phase of the high mass transfer started only @xmath7 yrs ago and may be sustained only for @xmath8 yrs ( r87 ) .",
    "the 685-s period was discovered in x - rays as a modulation with a @xmath023 percent peak - to - peak amplitude ( stella et al .",
    "the period is very stable , with a low @xmath9 yr@xmath10 ( chou & grindlay 2001 , hereafter cg01 ) , which makes it certain it is due to the binary motion .",
    "the modulation was proposed to be due to the obscuration of the x - ray source by a structure at the edge of the accretion disk .",
    "a stronger modulation in the uv was predicted by arons & king ( 1997 ) , and subsequently discovered by anderson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , with @xmath11 s and a 16 per cent peak - to - peak amplitude .",
    "the most unusual feature of 4u  1820303  appears to be the luminosity variation by factor of @xmath122 at a ( superorbital ) period of @xmath13 d ( priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ; smale & lochner 1992 ; cg01 ; imon 2003 ; wen et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter w06 ) .",
    "cg01 found the modulation is stable with @xmath14 d and @xmath15 yr@xmath10 based on data from 1969 to 2000 .",
    "w06 found @xmath16 d based on 8.5 yrs of _ rxte _ all sky monitor ( asm ) data .",
    "the fact that x - ray bursts take place only at the flux minima ( cornelisse et al .",
    "2003 , z07 ) proves that the observed variability is due to intrinsic luminosity / accretion rate changes and not due to , e.g. , obscuration or changes of the projected area of the source due to precession .",
    "this is further supported by strong correlations between the observed flux and the source spectral state , varying with the flux in a way typical of atoll - type neutron - star binaries ( bloser et al .",
    "2000 ; gladstone , done & gierliski 2007 ) , and between the frequency of khz qpos observed from the source and the flux ( zhang et al .  1998 ;",
    "van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "the source was classified as an atoll by hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) .",
    "the intrinsic , accretion - rate related , character of the long - term periodic flux changes in 4u  1820303  is unique among all sources showing superorbital variability . in other cases ,",
    "such changes of the observed flux appear compatible with being caused by accretion disc and/or jet precession , which either results in variable obscuration of emitted x - rays as in her x-1 ( katz 1973 ) , or changes the viewing angle of the presumed anisotropic emitter , as in ss 433 ( katz 1980 ) or cyg x-1 ( e.g. , lachowicz et al .  2006 ) , or both .",
    "however , that precession keeps the inclination angle of the disc with respect to the orbital plane constant , and thus it can not change the accretion rate ( or the luminosity ) . also , the ratio between the superorbital and orbital periods is @xmath17 , which is much higher than that possible to obtain from any kind of disc precession at the mass ratio of the system ( e.g. , larwood 1998 ; wijers & pringle 1999 ) .",
    "this appears to rule out also models which would attempt to explain the variable accretion rate by a varying disc inclination angle ( with respect to the orbital plane ) .    in order to explain the long - term periodic variability of the accretion rate , cg01 proposed a hierarchical triple stellar model , in which a distant tertiary exerts tidal forces on the inner binary",
    "this results in a cyclic exchange of the angular momentum between the inner system and the tertiary ( kozai 1962 ; lidov & ziglin 1976 ; mazeh & shaham 1979 ; bailyn & grindlay 1987 ; ford , kozinsky & rasio 2000 , hereafter f00 ; blaes , lee & socrates 2002 ; wen 2003 , hereafter w03 ) .",
    "the period of the resulting evolution of the parameters of the system is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the orbital period of the tertiary , implying @xmath20 d. the variable system parameter relevant here is the eccentricity , @xmath21 , of the inner system , which causes changes of the distance between the inner lagrange point , @xmath22 , and the center of mass of the secondary .",
    "this in turn changes the rate of the flow through @xmath22 and the accretion rate .",
    "the mass of the tertiary has been constrained by cg01 as @xmath23 based on the lack of its optical detection .",
    "we note that this constraint assumes the third body is a main - sequence star ; if it is a white dwarf or a neutron star , @xmath24 .",
    "( still , the third star is most likely on the main sequence , which we assume hereafter . )",
    "however , no specific calculations of the proposed triple system , e.g. , of the maximum @xmath21 from modelling the variable rate of the flow through the @xmath22 point , or of the system parameters from modelling gravitational evolution of the system , have been done yet .    here",
    ", we first analyse the _ rxte _ asm monitoring data and the proportional counter array ( pca ) scanning data , and use them to quantify the source x - ray variability .",
    "we then present calculations on the dependence of the accretion rate through @xmath22 on the eccentricity , which yields the maximum @xmath21 required to reproduce the observed amplitude of the superorbital variability .",
    "then , we model evolution of hierarchical triple stellar systems , and reproduce the @xmath0170-d period and the maximum eccentricity implied by the @xmath22-flow model .",
    "our results put constraints on the masses of the system component , the inclination between the inner and outer orbits , and the ratio between its semimajor axes .",
    "we also report a discovery of a remarkable synchronization between the superorbital period and the period of the relativistic periastron precession of the binary .",
    "fig .  [ asm ] shows the long - term light curve of 4u  1820303  from the _ rxte _ asm ( 1996 january 12007 february 20 ) . for the clarity of display",
    ", we have averaged some adjacent 1-day measurements in order to achieve the minimum significance of @xmath25 of the plotted count rate .",
    "we clearly see the cyclic variations of the count rate on the @xmath0170-d quasi - period with a large relative amplitude .",
    "the vertical lines show the predicted minima according to the ephemeris of eq .",
    "( 9 ) of cg01 . using the lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 )",
    ", we find that the present ( daily - averaged ) asm data yield @xmath26 d , compatible with the periods of cg01 and of w06 .",
    "[ phase](a ) shows the asm light curve folded on the ephemeris of cg01 , as well as the folded light curve averaged over 10 phase bins .",
    "we see that while the daily measurements span a factor @xmath1210 , the averaged light curve varies over the superorbital period spanning a factor of @xmath272 .",
    "we also use the available galactic bulge scan data from the _ rxte _ pca detector for the time interval of 1999 february 52006 october 30 .",
    "[ phase](b ) shows the count rate from those measurements folded , and folded over the superorbital ephemeris .",
    "we also show the count rate folded and averaged over 10 phase bins .",
    "similarly to the asm data , we see that while the individual measurements of the count rate span a factor @xmath2710 , the averaged light curve varies over the superorbital period spanning a factor @xmath272 .",
    "we stress , however , that the variability is not strictly periodic , and @xmath28 represents only a quasi - period . therefore , folding and averaging over a single period value results in some suppression of the actual average superorbital variability . with that caveat",
    ", we attribute the changes of the average flux within the factor @xmath272 to a relative stable quasi - periodic process ( sections [ flow][triple ] ) , and the remaining variability to some aperiodic processes , in particular those operating in other atoll sources .",
    "we also assume that the asm and pca count rate variability reflects that of the accretion rate , and assume hereafter its superorbital variability consists of variations within ( 0.7@xmath29",
    ".     folded on the superorbital ephemeris of cg01 .",
    "( b ) the folded light curve for the pca galactic bulge scan data ( see section [ data ] ) . on each panel ,",
    "the histogram shows the light curve averaged over 10 phase bins , and the solid curve shows the theoretical model of sections [ flow][triple ] ( based on the second cycle of fig .",
    "[ f_triple]a ) fitted to the averaged data .",
    "[ phase ] , width=317 ]    z07 have , in addition , analyzed available pca and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) pointed observations of 4u  1820303 . using a physically - motivated spectral model ,",
    "they have estimated the bolometric flux from the source for each observation .",
    "the resulting light curve , when folded over the ephemeris , is very similar to those of fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "in particular , the fractional variability of the folded / averaged light curve is also found to be @xmath02 . since the bolometric flux is highly likely to be proportional to the rate of accretion onto a neutron star , that result confirms that the superorbital range of @xmath30 is indeed within a factor of @xmath02 , as adopted above .",
    "here , we calculate the dependence of the rate of the roche lobe overflow ( assumed to equal the accretion rate ) on the eccentricity . for that , we follow classical results on the roche flow , expressing @xmath31 as the product of the density and the sound speed at the inner lagrangian point , @xmath22 , times an effective area of the flow .",
    "the position of the @xmath22 varies with the orbital phase in an eccentric orbit , yielding a varying @xmath31 .",
    "this yields the orbit - averaged @xmath31 as a function of the eccentricity , @xmath21 .",
    "this in turn allows us to determine the maximum eccentricity , @xmath32 , required to enhance @xmath33 by the factor of two inferred above from the varying @xmath34 , assuming that the minima of the superorbital cycle correspond to the @xmath21 minimum of @xmath35 .",
    "we first briefly estimate the parameters of the inner binary .",
    "we assume that the white dwarf fills its roche lobe .",
    "then , we combine the volume - averaged roche - lobe radius for @xmath36 of paczyski ( 1971 ) , @xmath37 with the kepler law , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gravitational constant , @xmath40 is the semimajor axis , and @xmath41 .",
    "this yields the relation , @xmath42 we then use the mass - radius relation for cold , low - mass stars of zapolsky & salpeter ( 1969 ; as fitted in r87 ) , and assume pure he and the radius equal that of the fully degenerate configuration times a factor , @xmath43 . for @xmath44 ( r87 ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 cm , where the lower and upper limits correspond to @xmath47 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we assume @xmath48 , for which the above @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspond to an he model of deloye & bildsten ( 2003 ) ( who has calculated the mass - radius relation for white dwarfs of arbitrary degeneracy ) with the core temperature of @xmath51 k and the core density of @xmath52 g @xmath53 . we note that for a star approximated by an @xmath54 polytrope ( chandrasekhar 1939 ) , we have @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the h mass fraction ) , which expression combined with equation ( [ m_r ] ) at @xmath57 yields @xmath58 and @xmath59 cm , the values identical to those above for @xmath48",

    "if we neglect for a while the illumination of the white dwarf by the x - ray source , the relevant index would be @xmath97 of the ( non - degenerate ) surface layers of the white dwarf ( schwarzchild 1958 ) .",

    "[ mdot_orbit](b ) shows the @xmath127 of this model .",
    "both the strong changes of the accretion rate over an orbit and the fast increase of the orbit - averaged rate with @xmath21 are due to the very fast increase of the product @xmath128 with @xmath93 , @xmath129 , in the surface layer of the white dwarf ( see above ) .",
    "we note that we have used here the structure of an isolated white dwarf , while the gravitational field close to @xmath22 is affected by the gravity of the neutron star .",
    "this would flatten the density profile and lead to a requirement of a somewhat higher @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the white dwarf is very close to the x - ray source , and thus it is irradiated .",
    "irradiation could be avoided if the accretion disk was strongly flared and obscured the white dwarf from the x - ray source .",
    "however , the observed strong orbital modulation in the uv ( anderson et al .",
    "1997 ) is well explained by reprocessing of x - rays by the white dwarf ( arons & king 1993 ) , which interpretation rules out strong flaring .",
    "thus , we consider now the case with irradiation of the white dwarf .",
    "the white dwarf subtends the solid angle @xmath130 , which , for our binary parameters , is @xmath131 . for the @xmath132 of z07 ( see above ) and an albedo of 0.5 ( e.g. , anderson 1981 ; london , mccray & auer 1981 ) , the white dwarf receives @xmath133 erg s@xmath10 , i.e. , several orders of magnitude more than its possible intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the absorbed flux per unit area at a mid - point of the white dwarf ( at @xmath134 from the neutron star ) varies then in the range @xmath135@xmath136 erg @xmath67 s@xmath10 .",
    "this variability is due to the x - ray luminosity undergoing the superorbital cycle with the amplitude of 2 .",
    "the corresponding blackbody temperature changes from @xmath137 k to @xmath138 .",
    "assuming @xmath139 , @xmath140 . in optically - thick regions ,",
    "the structure of the atmosphere will be closely isothermal at this @xmath141 ( e.g. , anderson 1981 ) .",
    "thus , the atmosphere density will decrease exponentially with the distance from the center of the white dwarf , @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the scaleheight around the @xmath22 point , @xmath144 where we used our numerical values of the parameters for the second equality .",
    "then , we use the results of brown & boyle ( 1984 ) , who derived @xmath145 ( see their eq .  4 ) , which can be expressed as , @xmath146 where @xmath147 ( @xmath148 s ) is close to the dynamical time scale of the white dwarf [ @xmath149 s ] , and @xmath150 is the atmosphere density at @xmath22 corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "here we neglected the correction of brown & boyle ( 1984 ) for the velocity of the @xmath22 point , since it is much slower than the sound speed in our case . note",
    "that though the functional dependence @xmath151 is most likely accurate , the constant of the proportionality remains relatively uncertain ( see savonije 1983 ) as well as the argument of the exponent may be more complex than that used above , see frank , king & raine ( 2002 ) , pp .  352353 .",
    "the latter effect may increase the scaleheight around @xmath22 and thus lead to a requirement of a higher @xmath32 than than that estimated by us below . to solve this problem accurately , hydrodynamical simulations ( see , e.g. , regs , bailey & mardling 2005 ) specific to 4u  1820303  ( beyond the scope of this work ) are needed .",
    "the @xmath143 and @xmath90 depend on @xmath21 through @xmath152 , and we denote their values at @xmath76 as @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "the accretion rate relative to that at @xmath76 can then be written as , @xmath155 this equation coupled with equations ( [ mdot_av][mdot_dim_less ] ) , giving @xmath127 , can be easily solved iteratively .",
    "this solution , for a given @xmath156 , can be used to calculate the eccentricity required for a given amplitude of @xmath157 .",
    "[ mdot_orbit](a ) shows an example of the dependence of equation ( [ mdot_exp_ratio ] ) for @xmath158 and @xmath159 , yielding @xmath108 ( i.e. , @xmath160 ) .",
    "[ mdot_orbit](b ) shows @xmath161 for the same @xmath156 .",
    "these dependences are slower than those of the unirradiated case due to the slower ( in the present case ) increase of the density with the depth within the atmosphere as well its isothermality .    in the irradiated case , the accretion rate enhancement due to the eccentricity depends primarily not on @xmath21 itself but on @xmath162 .",
    "in particular , the eccentricity required to obtain the increase of the orbit - averaged accretion rate by 2 is @xmath163 . also , @xmath127 increases initially , at low values of @xmath21 , very slowly .",
    "thus , our assumption that @xmath100 corresponds to @xmath76 ( see above ) introduces only a slight error as long as @xmath164 .",
    "we also note that the value of @xmath32 does not depend on the ( relatively uncertain ) normalization of the @xmath30 dependence of equation ( [ mdot_exp ] ) .    from that normalization , we can determine @xmath150 as , @xmath165 this corresponds to an electron density of @xmath166 @xmath53 , and the thomson optical depth above the @xmath22 of 1.0 .",
    "the rosseland absorption opacity at the above @xmath89 , @xmath167 k and @xmath168 is @xmath169 ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , i.e. , @xmath170 more than the scattering opacity for he .",
    "thus , the medium is completely optically thick , consistent with our assumption of the temperature equal to the blackbody one .",
    "the corresponding pressure is @xmath171 dyn @xmath67 , which can be calculated to be @xmath172 times more than the critical pressure below which a transition to an optically thin regime begins ( london et al .  1981 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath22 region may be partly shadowed by the accretion disc , which would decrease the temperature and move the @xmath22 region even more into the optically - thick regime .",
    "we also check that the time scale at which the atmosphere locally responds to the irradiation , @xmath173 ms , is much shorter than any other time scale of interest .    on the other hand ,",
    "the coefficient in equation ( [ mdot_exp ] ) and other details of the flow through @xmath22 are relatively uncertain , and thus it is of interest to also consider the case with the @xmath22 region being optically thin .",
    "above a transition zone ( anderson 1981 ; london et al .  1981 ) , the atmosphere temperature becomes close to the compton temperature of the surrounding radiation field ( e.g. , kallman & mccray 1982 ; begelman , mckee & shields 1983 ) , @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the mean intensity .",
    "for the sum of the x - ray spectrum of the source , its reflection from the star , and the blackbody emission from reprocessing in the underlying regions of the star , @xmath176 will be @xmath177 of the compton temperature for the x - ray spectrum alone . based on the spectral fits of z07",
    ", we have calculated the latter to range from ( 1.6@xmath178 k in the high - luminosity state to @xmath179 k in the low - luminosity state .",
    "thus , @xmath180 k for the dominant high - luminosity state . as",
    "the compton temperature depends only on the shape of the spectrum but not on its flux , @xmath181 is almost independent of @xmath30 , except for the lowest @xmath30 corresponding to the hard low state , where @xmath176 is several times higher . neglecting the last effect ( important only at the flux minima ) , equation ( [ scaleheight ] )",
    "yields @xmath182 .",
    "if this condition were dominant over the superorbital cycle , a rather high @xmath183 would be required to account for the superorbital variability .",
    "this would require changing the radius ( and mass ) of the white dwarf , and raise the issue of the stability of the mass transfer ( beyond the scope of this work ) .",
    "however , we stress that according to our estimates the @xmath22 region of the irradiated star is unlikely to be in the optically thin regime .    on the other hand , we can not rule out that the @xmath22 point is in the transition zone ( anderson 1981 ; london et al .  1981 ) between @xmath184 k and @xmath110 k , in which case detailed solutions of the atmosphere structure would be required to calculate @xmath161 , and the @xmath32 would be somewhat higher than the value of 0.004 estimated above . on the other hand ,",
    "the shadowing of the white dwarf by the disc would ( as mentioned above ) decrease the temperature of the @xmath22 region .",
    "these effects introduce some systematic uncertainties on the value of @xmath32 .",
    "above , we have modelled the accretion rate variability in 4u  1820303  as due to variability of the binary eccentricity . here , we model the required variability of the eccentricity as due to gravity of a third star in the system",
    ". the third star should have the semimajor axis ( @xmath185 ; measured with respect to the center of mass of the inner binary ) satisfying @xmath186 in order not to perturb the binary motion on time scales in the range between @xmath187 and @xmath28 , which perturbations have not been observed .",
    "thus , this model is of a hierachical triple system .",
    "we then attempt to reproduce the observed 171-d period and its relative coherence ( section [ data ] ) as well as the eccentricity amplitude necessary to reproduce the observed amplitude of the superorbital variability as inferred from our @xmath22-flow calculations ( section [ flow ] ) .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the main features of secular effects in hierarchical triple systems .",
    "it has been known ( e.g. , kozai 1962 ) that a third outer body can induce quasi - periodic oscillations of the inner eccentricity with a long quasiperiod of @xmath188 where @xmath19 ( the outer orbital period ) is given by @xmath189 @xmath190 , and @xmath191 ( often @xmath01 ) depends on the system parameters .",
    "there are two main regimes . at an initial mutual inclination , @xmath192 , above a critical angle , @xmath193 , the amplitude of the inner eccentricity is large and @xmath194",
    ". the evolution can be well described by taking into account only the lowest - order perturbative term in the system hamiltonian expanded in powers of @xmath195 , namely the quadrupole term , @xmath196 .",
    "then , the mutual inclination , @xmath197 , is anticorrelated with the inner eccentricity , @xmath21 , with @xmath198 constant . in this approximation ,",
    "both semimajor axes , the outer eccentricity , @xmath199 , and the magnitude of the angular momentum of the outer binary are constant , and there is exchange of the angular momentum between the inner and outer binary . in a conservative system ,",
    "also the total angular momentum and energy are constant .",
    "the maximum inner eccentricity is rougly @xmath200^{1/2}$ ] ( innanen et al .",
    "1997 ; holman , touma & tremaine 1997 ) above the critical angle ( and thus @xmath201 for @xmath202 ) .    below @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and",
    "the quadrupole approximation becomes insufficient .",
    "in particular , for coplanar orbits , @xmath205 , the quadrupole term in the hamiltonian becomes null , and the first non - zero term is octupole , @xmath206 . in the octupole approximation ,",
    "only the semimajor axes are constant ( apart from the total energy and angular momentum ) . in this regime , the inner eccentricity also varies quasi - periodically , but at a period longer than that of the quadrupole one . in the intermediate regime where both terms are important , time dependencies of the inner eccentricity show both periodicities ( krymolowski & mazeh 1999 ) .",
    "also , at @xmath204 in general , @xmath32 decreases with the increasing @xmath207 , increases with the increasing the initial outer eccentricity , @xmath208 , and it depends very weakly on either @xmath209 or @xmath210 ( f00 ) .",
    "we use a numerical model calculating the time evolution of an isolated hierarchical triple of point masses , using secular perturbation theory up to the octupole terms ( e.g. , f00 ; miller & hamilton 2002 ; blaes et al .  2002 ; w03 ) .",
    "we neglect possible effect of the tidal deformation of the white dwarf on the gravitational force exerted on the inner binary , see , e.g. , sderhjelm ( 1984 ) , eggleton & kiseleva - eggleton ( 2001 ) .",
    "also , the hamiltonian is averaged over the periods of both the inner and outer binaries , and thus any possible short - time scale changes ( e.g. , bailyn 1987 ; georgakarakos 2002 ) are averaged out .",
    "our calculations are newtonian apart from the general relativistic ( gr ) periastron precession in the inner binary .",
    "its first - order post - newtonian period , @xmath211 , is given by ( e.g. , weinberg 1973 ) , @xmath212 we include this effect in the same way as in , e.g. , w03 .",
    "the free parameters of the model are the masses of the neutron star , @xmath4 , and of the third star , @xmath213 , @xmath207 , @xmath192 , @xmath208 , and @xmath214 .",
    "we assume @xmath215 ( section [ flow ] ) .",
    "then , we know @xmath187 and @xmath28 , and assume @xmath216 ( section [ flow ] )",
    ".    given the relatively large number of free parameters and complex dependencies between them and the resulting period and the amplitude of the eccentricity modulation , it has proven difficult to constrain the parameter space numerically .",
    "thus , we have obtained some approximate analytical constraints .",
    "given the presence of only one , well - defined , long - term periodicity in the system ( section [ data ] ; w06 ) , evolution of the triple system can be dominated by either the quadrupole or the octupole term , but not by both , which would have given rise to two periodicities ( as noted above ) . given the considerably greater simplicity of the quadrupole equations , we consider them for our analytical estimates ( though we do include the octupole term in numerical calculations ) . given our requirement of @xmath204 ,",
    "this implies values of @xmath192 close to @xmath203 .",
    "we first estimate the maximum eccentricity .",
    "we use the conservation of the total angular momentum and energy .",
    "the former gives us the mutual inclination , @xmath197 , in terms of @xmath192 and @xmath21 , e.g. , eq .  ( 3 ) in miller & hamilton ( 2002 ) .",
    "then the ( quadrupole ) hamiltonian gives the total energy .",
    "the minimum and maximum inner eccentricity corresponds to the inner periastron angle ( measured from the intersection of the two orbits ) , @xmath217 , of 0 and @xmath218 , respectively .",
    "equating the hamiltonian at those two angles and using @xmath197 from the angular momentum conservation , gives , in the lowest ( second ) order of @xmath21 , @xmath219 where @xmath220 in order for a solution with @xmath221 to exist , the denominator in equation ( [ e_max ] ) should be nearly zero . also , @xmath222 at @xmath223 , which we assume hereafter .",
    "thus , @xmath224 note that this @xmath203 is also the critical angle for the large @xmath32 regime ( see blaes et al .",
    "2002 ) , and it becomes the newtonian critical angle when @xmath225 ( kozai 1962 ) . in the small @xmath21 limit , the initial mutual inclination angle should be approximately equal to but slightly _ smaller _ than the critical value , which is different from the requirement for high @xmath32 regime .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is determined by how close @xmath197 is to @xmath203 .    for a solution of equation ( [ icrit ] ) to exist , @xmath226 is required .",
    "then , we have from equation ( [ tpn ] ) , @xmath227 for @xmath228 , the upper limit on @xmath213 of @xmath229 ( cg01 ) and @xmath230 , @xmath231 .",
    "note that the constraint of equation ( [ a_ratio ] ) is the same as that derived for the high-@xmath21 case [ except for the @xmath232 factor , blaes et al .",
    "it is related to the fact that the newtonian regime corresponds to @xmath233 .",
    "otherwise , the gr periastron precession decreases the amplitude of the kozai oscillations of @xmath21 , and leads to its disappearing in opposite limit .",
    "this is because the effect of the third body is a coherent summation of the tidal perturbations over many orbital periods , and the gr precession partly destroys this coherence ( e.g. , w03 ) .",
    "in particular , this leads to a change of @xmath203 , equation ( [ icrit ] ) , reducing the high-@xmath32 regime .",
    "another constraint on the parameter space comes from the observed @xmath234 d. the inner binary spends most of the time around @xmath235 , at which @xmath236 .",
    "we thus write @xmath237 with @xmath238 and expand the ( quadrupole ) evolution equations for @xmath21 and @xmath217 [ e.g. , eqs .",
    "( 1617 ) in w03 ] to the first order in @xmath239 and in the small-@xmath21 approximation .",
    "we then use equation ( [ e_max ] ) to express the results in terms of @xmath240 , divide @xmath241 by @xmath242 , and integrate over @xmath21 from @xmath214 to @xmath32 .",
    "this yields the value of @xmath191 [ equation ( [ period ] ) ] of @xmath243 where @xmath244 is a fudge factor to compensate for the approximation we used in the derivation .",
    "we found empirically that @xmath245 are within a factor of two , and in our example described below , @xmath246 .",
    "note also that the superorbital period is strongly dependent on @xmath214 , on which the accretion rate depends very weakly ( as long as @xmath35 , fig .  [",
    "mdot_orbit]b ) .    the following constraint on the total mass of the inner binary can be obtained using equations ( [ period][p2 ] ) , ( [ tpn ] ) and ( [ p3_pn ] ) , @xmath247 which ( for the observed @xmath187 and @xmath28 ) can be solved for @xmath248 as , @xmath249 the constraint of @xmath226 then yields a relation between @xmath250 and @xmath251 , @xmath252 at @xmath253 , it allows @xmath254 provided @xmath255 . since the required relative amplitude of @xmath31 of @xmath256 can be achieved at any @xmath257 ( see the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ mdot_orbit]b ) , this is only a very weak constraint , allowing practically any of the theoretically possible masses of the neutron star at modest values of @xmath240 .    equation ( [ tpn ] ) at @xmath226 also yields a constraint on @xmath213 . if we assume @xmath258 and that the system is hierarchical , @xmath259 , we obtain @xmath260 [ see also equation ( [ a_ratio ] ) ] .",
    "an independent relation follows from equations ( [ period][p2 ] ) and ( [ p3_pn ] ) , @xmath261 which yields the same constraint of @xmath260 at @xmath262 .",
    "thus , even a very low - mass third body can still induce the required eccentricity oscillations in the inner binary .",
    "we have not studied analytically constraints in the octupole - dominated regime ( which regime has been considered , e.g. , by rasio 1994 , 1995 ; f00 ; georgakarakos 2002 ; lee & peale 2003 ) .",
    "the octupole - dominated regime may likely yield solutions with @xmath263 ( as compared to @xmath264 in the quadrupole regime ) .",
    "still , if such solutions exist , our conclusion of only very weak constraints on the masses of the system components would remain unaffected . on the other hand ,",
    "an important difference between solutions in the two regimes is the variability of the mutual inclination . in the quadrupole low-@xmath21 regime ,",
    "the maximum change , @xmath265 , is given by @xmath266 which implies only a very small change of @xmath197 over the course of the superorbital cycle , e.g. , about @xmath267 at @xmath268 , @xmath269 .",

    ", we can relate @xmath302 to @xmath31 and @xmath303 ( assuming @xmath300 ) , @xmath304 where @xmath302 includes all contributions to the inner angular momentum loss .",

    "also , @xmath308 .",
    "this is in conflict with the observations , showing @xmath309 ( see section [ intro ] ) .",
    "we note here that taking into account a possible mass loss from the system can not resolve this discrepancy . if a fraction , @xmath239 , of the mass lost by the secondary is ejected from the system , we derive from equations ( [ roche][kepler ] ) and ( [ rwd ] ) , @xmath310 thus , although the mass loss reduces @xmath303 , it is still @xmath311 . only in the absence of mass transfer ,",
    "when the companion does _ not _ fill its roche lobe , angular momentum losses ( in particular , those due to gravitational radiation ) lead to @xmath312 .",
    "a possible resolution of this conflict is the apparent observed @xmath309 resulting from gravitational acceleration of the system in the cluster potential ( cg01 ) .",
    "then , the likely evolutionary scenario of 4u  1820303  is still that of r87 , as shown on their fig .  1 . according to it , the period shortly after the onset of the mass transfer ( @xmath7 yr ago ) was @xmath0500 s. then",
    ", @xmath40 was lower and @xmath248 higher [ equation [ tpn ] ) ] than now .",
    "consequently , @xmath313 was less than the present value ( i.e. , the low-@xmath32 , octupole , regime was increased ) , see equation ( [ icrit ] ) .",
    "thus , the eccentricity oscillations had in the past lower amplitudes than now , and the system was in the octupole - dominated regime . on the other hand , a future increase of @xmath187 may lead to @xmath314 and moving the system to the high-@xmath32 regime ( provided @xmath315 at present ) .    on the other hand , we find that at the present moment of the source evolution , the gr periastron precession period , @xmath211 , is very close , and may be equal exactly , to the superorbital period , @xmath28 .",
    "namely , @xmath316 we consider this equality to be a very remarkable coincidence .",
    "we do not see any straightforward way in which the gr periastron precession could by itself ( i.e. , without the presence of a third star ) affect the orbit - averaged accretion rate .",
    "thus , the origin of the above equality can be either purely accidental or it may be due to some evolutionary processes not understood yet .",
    "we note that f00 find the presence of a resonance at @xmath317 manifesting itself as a peak in @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "14 in f00 ) .",
    "however , it is not clear how that resonance could lead to the synchronization of @xmath317 .",
    "on the other hand , our results and those of r87 do allow @xmath318 to be satisfied exactly .",
    "if this is the case and at @xmath319@xmath320 , @xmath83 ( section [ flow ] ) , the mass of the neutron star would be @xmath321@xmath322 .",
    "remarkably , modelling of an x - ray burst of 4u  1820303  by shaposhnikov & titarchuk ( 2004 ) gives @xmath323 . also , grindlay et al .",
    "( 1984 ) have measured the total masses of low - mass x - ray binaries in globular clusters ( including 4u  1820303 ) and concluded that the initial neutron - star masses appear substantially less than @xmath324 on average .",
    "we also note that some low neutron - star masses have recently been measured with high precision , e.g. , @xmath325 for psr j07373039b ( lyne et al .",

    "2005 ) . given those results , @xmath71 in 4u",
    "1820303  appears entirely plausible .",
    "we also note that although arons & king ( 1993 ) proposed that @xmath327 if the initial mass of the white dwarf were @xmath328 and @xmath329 has been accreted , the calculations of r87 imply a much lower initial mass and a short mass - transfer time interval , with only @xmath330 accreted .",
    "then , zhang et al .  ( 1998 ) proposed that @xmath331 if the frequency of the upper khz qpo at its apparent saturation at 1060 hz were equal to the keplerian frequency at the last stable orbit .",
    "however , van der klis ( 2000 ) shows that there is no saturation in a more extensive data set .",
    "also , current theoretical models of khz qpos do not postulate that frequency identification , and use it only to provide an upper mass limit ( e.g. , van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "the presence of the third star may affect the system evolution only if it remains stable and is not disrupted by encounters with stars in the cluster .",
    "the triple system itself is stable if @xmath332 ( mardling & aarseth 2001 ) , which is clearly satisfied in our case , with @xmath333 , @xmath334 ( section [ triple ] ) , and @xmath23 ( cg01 ) .",
    "then , the encounter time scale has been estimated by miller & hamilton ( 2002 ) in the limit of domination of gravitational focusing , and we write it as @xmath335 here , @xmath336 is the number density of stars , which we assume to be numerically equal to the mass density of @xmath337 pc@xmath338 in the core of ngc 6624 ( ivanova et al .",
    "2005 ) , and @xmath339 cm , @xmath340 ( section [ triple ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath341 is much longer than the gravitational - radiation time scale , equation ( [ tau_g ] ) , but still shorter than an estimated cooling time of the white dwarf in 4u  1820303  of @xmath342 yr ( the appendix of r87 ) .",
    "thus , an encounter could have formed the triple system during the lifetime of 4u  1820303 , but it is stable on the current evolutionary time scale .",
    "we also note that the angular momentum will also be lost from the system due to tidal dissipation within the secondary at @xmath299 .",
    "this mechanism usually leads to circularization ( and synchronization ) of close binaries ( e.g. , zahn 1977 ) , but in our case the influence of the tertiary will force @xmath343 and continuous dissipation ( mazeh & shaham 1979 ) .",
    "the time scale for this process , @xmath344 , is related to the circularization time scale .",
    "this , unfortunately , remains very uncertain for stars without convective envelopes , in particular white dwarfs ( e.g. , zahn 1977 ) , and it may be very long . here , we consider the turbulent dissipation model of press , wiita & smarr ( 1975 ) , which probably gives the the lower limit to the actual dissipation time scale in a white dwarf ( zahn 1977 ) . using the time scale of press et al .",
    "( 1975 ) and the approach of mazeh & shaham ( 1979 ) , we obtain , @xmath345 where @xmath346 is the effective reynolds number , which we assume @xmath347 following press et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , and @xmath348 is a dimensionless factor of the mean turbulent viscosity , @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the stellar density .",
    "we have calculated @xmath351 for a polytrope with @xmath54 , appropriate for a low - mass white dwarf . for our system parameters , we find then @xmath352 yr ( where the average is over the superorbital cycle ) , which for @xmath353 becomes @xmath354 yr . thus , even if the dissipation is as fast as envisaged by press et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , the process is completely negligible compared to the gravitational radiation .",
    "however , @xmath355 for @xmath356 .    on the other hand , the soft x - ray absorption towards the source is consistent with being caused entirely by the interstellar medium , with no evidence for any local component ( futamoto et al .",
    "this appears to rule out strong outflows from either the irradiated disc , the irradiated surface of the white dwarf , or , in particular , mass loss through the @xmath357 point . at the mass ratio of the binary",
    ", the absence of the @xmath357 mass loss by the roche - lobe filling star imposes the constraint of @xmath358 , as calculated by rgos , bailey & mardling ( 2005 ) .",
    "this rules out the above condition of @xmath356 .",
    "thus , presently , tidal dissipation appears not to be the dominant channel of angular momentum loss .",
    "we have obtained the following main results .    \\1 . using the _ rxte _ data , we quantify the average amplitude of the superorbital variability of the source .",
    "we find that amplitude in the folded and averaged light curves to be by about a factor of two .",
    "we consider the model in which the superorbital variability is due to a third star inducing cyclic variations ( kozai 1962 ) of the eccentricity of the binary ( as proposed by cg01 ) .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the rate of the roche - lobe overflow on the eccentricity taking into account the strong irradiation of the white dwarf by the x - ray source ( fig .",
    "[ mdot_orbit]b ) .",
    "we find the amplitude of the eccentricity required to account for the variability of the accretion rate by the factor of two is @xmath160 ( assuming the minimum of the eccentricity is close to null ) .",
    "however , systematic uncertainties of this model may somewhat change the actual value of @xmath32 .",
    "we reproduce the above maximum eccentricity of @xmath1 and the observed superorbital period of 171 d in a detailed model of a hierarchical triple system .",
    "our calculations are newtonian except for inclusion of the gr periastron precession .",
    "we then convolve the obtained eccentricity light curve with our theoretical dependence of the accretion rate on the eccentricity and obtain a theoretical luminosity light curve .",
    "this theoretical light curve is compared to and found to be in a good agreement with the observed light curves from the asm and pca detectors , see figs .",
    "[ asm][phase ] .",
    "we also study the parameter space allowed by the observational data , the @xmath160 constraint , and @xmath23 ( cg01 ) .",
    "we obtain analytical solutions for the low - eccentricity kozai oscillations in the regime dominated by the quadrupole terms of the evolution equations .",
    "we find the ratio of the semimajor axes to be @xmath359 , which follows from the constraint that the gr periastron precession does not quench the kozai eccentricity modulation .",
    "the masses of the system components are only weakly constrained .",
    "in particular , the canonical neutron - star mass of @xmath324 is allowed in this model .",
    "the mass of the third body is constrainted as @xmath360 .",
    "we find that the period of the binary gr periastron precession is approximately equal ( and it is allowed to be exactly equal ) to the observed superorbital period ( which equals the period of the kozai eccentricity oscillations in our model ) .",
    "we find this to be a remarkable and puzzling example of synchronization in a physical system .",
    "we obtain some other constraints on the system .",
    "the binary eccentricity has to be @xmath361 from the apparent absence of the mass loss by the roche - lobe filling white dwarf through the @xmath357 point . the angular momentum loss due to tidal dissipation in the white dwarf is found to be negligible compared to the loss due to emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "also , we find the theoretical mass transfer rate due to the angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation is in complete agreement with that corresponding to the average bolometric flux from this source ( as measured by z07 ) .",
