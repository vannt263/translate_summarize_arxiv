    "the observed vertical distribution of gas in the galaxy , especially the cold neutral component at large heights , can not be supported by thermal pressure alone ( lockman & gehman 1991 ; ferrara 1993 ) . often invoked to provide the required additional pressure are turbulent motions of the interstellar gas , magnetic fields , and cosmic rays ( boulares & cox 1990 ; lockman & gehman 1991 ) .",
    "of these , turbulent pressure is perhaps the dominant pressure component in the interstellar medium ( ism ; mckee 1990 ) .",
    "there are strong reasons to believe that supersonic turbulence also regulates star formation processes in molecular clouds by lowering the efficiency of star formation ( elmegreen & scalo 2004 ; mac low & klessen 2004 ; krumholz & mckee 2005 ; krumholz & tan 2007 ) .    supernova ( sn ) explosions are thought to be the dominant agent for producing turbulent motions in star - forming parts of galaxies ( norman & ferrara 1996 ; mac low & klessen 2004 ) .",
    "interactions between blast waves from multiple sne lead to compression and shearing of the gas . in extreme cases , explosions",
    "that are spatially and temporally correlated may collectively generate a superwind , observed at both low ( e.g. , martin 1999 ; heckman et al .",
    "2000 ) and high redshifts ( pettini et al .  2001 , 2002 ; shapley et al .",
    "2003 ; weiner et al .",
    "mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) provided a picture of the ism in which three distinct phases regulated by sn explosions exist in rough pressure equilibrium .",
    "the multiphase model does not directly include turbulent pressure produced by interactions among multiple sn - driven blast waves and large pressure fluctuations in the ism .",
    "numerical simulations ( rosen & bregman 1995 ; korpi et al .  1999 ; gazol - patio & passot 1999 ; de avillez & berry 2001 ; kim 2004 ; de avillez & breitschwerdt 2004 , 2005 ; mac low et al .",
    "2005 ; slyz et al .  2005 ; joung & mac low 2006 , hereafter paper i ; tasker & bryan 2006 ) and observations of thermally unstable gas ( heiles 2001 ; heiles & troland 2003 , 2005 ) also support this dynamic picture . since turbulent pressure is a significant , sometimes the dominant , form of pressure in the ism , its inclusion is vital for any realistic model of the ism .",
    "another motivation for this study comes from longstanding problems in cosmology .",
    "the standard cold dark matter paradigm has been widely successful in explaining structures on cosmological scales ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang et al .  1995",
    "; rauch 1998 ; bertschinger 1998 ; cen & ostriker 2000 ; springel et al .  2005 ; dunkley et al .",
    "2008 ) . yet",
    "our understanding of the luminous matter on galactic scales remains seriously incomplete , mainly due to complexities of baryon physics , for which additional nonlinear thermal and hydrodynamic processes must be taken into account .",
    "a prime example is the galaxy luminosity function , which shows lower abundances of galaxies both on the faint and the bright ends compared to the halo mass distribution ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "other outstanding astrophysical problems include incorrect predictions for the size of disk galaxies ( the `` angular momemtum problem '' ; e.g. , navarro & white 1994 ; steinmetz & navarro 1999 ) and for the fraction of gas that should have cooled to form galaxies ( the `` overcooling problem '' ) .",
    "feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei plays a central role to explain these discrepancies in recent semi - analytic models ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ; bower et al .  2006 ; hopkins et al .  2008 ; somerville et al .",
    "2008 ) . despite mounting evidence that sne played a major role in galaxy formation ( see , e.g. , adelberger et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) , it has been difficult to incorporate the details of stellar feedback into cosmological simulations .",
    "early studies found that thermal energy input did not affect the ism significantly , as it was radiated away almost instantly ( katz 1992 ; navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "this was due to a lack of numerical resolution , which led to an absence of hot gas that would have radiated inefficiently and substantially decreased the overall cooling rate .",
    "past attempts to resolve this difficulty ( e.g. , kauffman et al .   1993 ;",
    "somerville & primack 1999 ; efstathiou 2000 ; thacker & couchman 2001 ; springel & hernquist 2003 ) have been phenomenological in nature , as they contain one or more free parameters that need to be adjusted to match observations , e.g. , the observed rates of star formation .",
    "what is lacking is a detailed high - resolution 3d model of turbulent flows within a small region of the ism , to help identify basic properties of interstellar turbulence .",
    "our aim in this paper is to provide a framework in which to handle sn feedback in cosmological simulations .",
    "we divide this challenging task into two parts .",
    "first , we run a suite of numerical simulations of stratified ism driven by discrete sn explosions .",
    "the sn rate and the vertical gas column density are systematically varied over wide ranges to examine how the velocity dispersion changes as a function of the gas density , length scale , and the assumed sn rate .",
    "in particular , we study the distribution and variation of turbulent pressure in these models .",
    "these local , high - resolution simulations have high enough spatial resolution to follow turbulent motions of the interstellar gas in detail .",
    "the second step is to use the local ism models to find a prescription for the physics unresolved in global , cosmological simulations so that we have a better idea of how to handle sn feedback .",
    "we propose a subgrid model based on heuristic analytic arguments and simulation results .",
    "the idea is as follows : if we average relevant physical quantities over scales greater than the largest energy containing scale , we may describe the large - scale dynamics of the ism that is insensitive to the details of the small - scale physics .",
    "this is motivated by similar studies in the past ( yepes et al .",
    "1997 ; springel 2000 ) as well as the new finding in paper i that @xmath590% of the total kinetic energy of the disk is contained on scales below 200 pc , comparable to the size of resolution elements in current cosmological simulations ( e.g. , governato et al .  2004 , 2007 ;",
    "cen et al .",
    "2005 ; naab et al .",
    "2007 ; gibson et al .  2008 ; joung et al .  2008 ) .",
    "this suggests the interesting possibility that the sn - driven turbulence may be handled separately as subgrid physics in those simulations .",
    "based on the physical characteristics of our local ism models with discrete sn explosions , the subgrid model is physically well - motivated .",
    "we apply the results of our ism models by formulating an accurate feedback prescription after deriving an effective equation of state for turbulent pressure of the medium .",
    "such a prescription may be used to examine the effect of sn feedback in large cosmological volumes .",
    "dib et al .",
    "( 2006 ) investigated the relationship between the velocity dispersion of the gas and the sn rate in 3d simulations of unstratified , periodic boxes with a fixed mean density .",
    "their aim was to explore the observed constancy of the velocity dispersion in the outer parts of galactic disks ( dickey et al .",
    "1990 ; kamphuis 1993 ) and the transition to the starburst regime .",
    "they simulated a ( 1 kpc)@xmath6 volume of the unstratified ism with 128@xmath6 cells for various sn rates , while keeping the gas density of the box constant .",
    "they found nearly constant velocity dispersions for the gas at relatively low sn rates ( 0.01 to 0.5 times the galactic value ; note thtat they took a galactic sn rate per volume of @xmath7 myr@xmath0 kpc@xmath8 ) , as well as a transition to the starburst regime at about the star formation rate per unit area of 0.51@xmath910@xmath10 m@xmath11 kpc@xmath10 yr@xmath0 ( assuming a salpeter initial mass function ; salpeter 1955 ) , in good agreement with observations .",
    "the present study extends their work to stratified atmospheres at higher spatial resolution where the gas density is systematically increased with increasing sn rate .",
    "the basic features of our ism models are described in   [ models ] . in ",
    "[ genchar ] , we describe the thermal and structural properties of the models .",
    "we demonstrate in   [ turbpres ] that the turbulent pressure of a medium with a given sn rate is independent of the local density , and study how the velocity dispersion and linewidth vary as a function of the assumed sn rate . using these results",
    ", we construct a new subgrid model and calibrate it against the ism simulations in ",
    "[ subgrid ] .",
    "finally , we discuss several outstanding open issues (   [ discuss ] ) and summarize our main results (   [ summary ] ) .",
    "we use the model described in paper i and its extensions described here .",
    "our simulations are performed using flash v2.4 , an eulerian astrophysical hydrodynamics code with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) capability , developed by the flash center at the university of chicago ( fryxell et al .",
    "it solves the euler equations using the piecewise - parabolic method ( colella & woodward 1984 ) to handle compressible flows with shocks . for parallelization",
    ", the message - passing interface library is used ; the amr is handled by the paramesh library .",
    "although , in the present work , we consider sne as the only source of interstellar turbulence , other processes such as gravitational instability ( e.g. , li et al .",
    "2005a ) , magneto - jeans instability ( kim & ostriker 2002 ) , magnetorotational instability ( e.g. , piontek & ostriker 2005 ) , expanding regions ( matzner 2002 ) and protostellar outflows ( haverkorn et al .  2004 ; nakamura & li 2007 ; banerjee et al .  2007 ;",
    "carroll et al .",
    "2008 ) should all contribute to the observed turbulence on various length scales .",
    "however , mac low & klessen ( 2004 ) argue that these other processes may play relatively minor roles .",
    "we assume that they are insignificant on the spatial scales resolved in our models .",
    "our computation box contains a volume of ( 0.5 kpc)@xmath12(10 kpc ) , elongated in the vertical direction .",
    "if the grid were fully resolved at our maximum resolution of 1.95 pc , it would contain 256@xmath125120 zones , but fully refined cells are mostly concentrated near the galactic midplane ( the central @xmath13 pc ) of our models .",
    "the gravitational potential of kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) is employed . for simplicity",
    ", the gravitational potential is fixed for all models , except in the model with the highest sn rate ( 512x ) , where the increased gas surface density dominates the gravitational potential , as it exceeds the assumed stellar mass surface density of @xmath14 m@xmath11 kpc@xmath10 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . assuming the schmidt - kennicutt law and taking @xmath15 m@xmath11 pc@xmath10 and @xmath16 m@xmath11 pc@xmath10 for the solar neighborhood ( binney & tremaine 1987 )",
    ", we increase the gravitational acceleration due to the disk component in the kuijken & gilmore potential by a factor of 11 for the 512x model .",
    "this is our standard 512x model , and the results are based on this model , unless otherwise noted . for comparison",
    ", we also ran a model with the same sn rate but with the gravitational potential used in the lower sn rate models ; this latter model will be denoted 512xl .",
    "self - gravity of gas is not included .",
    "outflow boundary conditions are used in the upper and lower surfaces parallel to the galactic plane , while periodic boundary conditions are employed elsewhere .    for each sn explosion , we dump thermal energy @xmath17 ergs in a small sphere whose radius varies as a function of the local density .",
    "the radii are chosen such that radiative losses inside the spheres are negligible in the first few timesteps after explosions ( paper i ) ; they usually range between @xmath17 and @xmath150 pc .",
    "we use them to trace the thermal history of metal particles and to estimate their escape fraction from the galaxy .",
    "we assume that a fixed fraction , 3/5 , of the type ii sne are closely correlated in space and in time as a way of simulating superbubbles .",

    "wong & blitz ( 2002 ) reported observational evidence for seven co - bright spiral galaxies that the azimuthally averaged star formation rate per unit area scales with the gas column density similarly to the disk - averaged star formation law ( see li et al .",

    "the diffuse heating rate @xmath30 in each model may not be directly proportional to @xmath23 because the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation responsible for the photoelectric heating ( @xmath31@xmath32 ev ) may be significantly shielded in regions of high densities .",

    "we obtain @xmath42 . as in paper",
    "i , the diffuse heating rate in each model declines exponentially away from the galactic midplane with a scale height of 300 pc .",
    "we note that another set of models was run with a different scaling relation for the diffuse heating rate : @xmath43 .",
    "these models , however , yielded results inconsistent with observations .",
    "for example , almost all the gas in the 512x model in this set resided in the warm phase ( @xmath44 k , the maximum gas temperature where diffuse heating is applied in our models ) , and the turbulent pressure was smaller than the thermal pressure by a factor of a few , in disagreement with observations .",
    "our result is consistent with the simulations in kim ( 2004 ) , who found that the velocity dispersion of the gas in a sn - driven medium is lower for higher external pressure .",
    "although we do not present these models in this paper , they illustrate the importance of including a proper form of diffuse heating rate , as it affects the balance among various interstellar gas phases .",
    "figure [ mid_all ] displays ( from top to bottom ) gas density , temperature , and thermal pressure in the midplane of the four ism models .",
    "figure [ vfrac ] shows probablity distribution functions for those variables . as in the galactic sn rate model discussed in paper i ,",
    "the three classical phases of the ism are present in every model , with cold , dense filaments surrounded by warm gases that in turn are embedded in hot media",
    ". however , their volume fractions vary as a function of the sn rate : the hot and cold phases increase in volume with increasing sn rate , while the volume occupied by the warm phase generally decreases ( fig .",
    "[ vfrac]b ) .",
    "interestingly , the gas fraction in the thermally unstable range of temperatures ( 200 @xmath45 7000 k ) increases steadily with the sn rate ( fig .",
    "[ vfrac]b ) , reflecting more dynamic ism with higher sn rates .",
    "more subtle differences are also found .",
    "for example , the mean density of the hot gas becomes progressively higher as the sn rate increases ( fig .",
    "[ vfrac]a ) , likely caused by an increased level of turbulent diffusion off dense shells and filaments where sn explosions occur more frequently ( de avillez & mac low 2002 ) . partly due to the increase in density ,",
    "the overall thermal pressure @xmath46 in the midplane increases with the sn rate ( fig .",
    "[ vfrac]c ) . within each ism model , however , we find that thermal pressure varies within a range of roughly two orders of magnitude ( mac low et al .",
    "the peak of the pressure distribution in the galactic sn rate model lies at @xmath1@xmath47 cm@xmath8 k , close to the mean value measured with c i fine - structure lines ( jenkins & tripp 2007 ) .",
    "recent sn remnants are associated with thermal pressures higher than the mean , whereas old sn remnants are tied to those that are lower .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath46 rises for high sn rate models , where its maximum value reaches @xmath1@xmath49 cm@xmath8 k , close to the value measured near the center of m82 ( strickland & heckman 2007 ) .",
    "our results are broadly in agreement with the analytic model by monaco ( 2004 ) in which the ism was modeled as a two - phase medium in pressure equilibrium .",
    "the vertical distributions of the ism models are shown in figure [ vert_all ] . in all models ,",
    "correlated sn explosions create superbubbles that vent hot ( @xmath50 k ) metal - enriched gas out of the galactic disk into the halo with high velocities ( @xmath51 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "as the sn rate increases , the total gas mass also increases ; a gradually larger mass fraction resides in the cold phase rather than in the warm phase . with stronger gravity",
    ", we would expect the dense gas to be more confined to the galactic plane , decreasing the disk thickness , while superbubbles would blow out more easily into the halo . on the other hand , the change in the ism near the galactic midplane should be modest .",
    "this is what we find by comparing the two models , 512x and 512xl .",
    "the 512x model has higher gas densities in the midplane as well as higher turbulent velocities than those in the 512xl model .",
    "in particular , it is worth noting that the 512x model shows superbubble blow - outs , contrary to expectations from some previous work ( see   [ discuss ] for more details ) .",
    "we examine the distribution of turbulent pressures in our models after the systems reach statistical steady states at @xmath52 myr . because kinetic energy is distributed over a broad range of wavelengths ( see fig .",
    "8b of paper i ) , turbulent pressure is inherently a scale - dependent quantity . to quantify the random ( i.e. , turbulent ) component of the velocity field",
    "apart from the bulk motion of the medium , the root - mean - square ( rms ) velocity dispersion @xmath37 is measured in the local frame of reference , i.e. , the center of mass frame of a selected volume .",

    "is successively increased twofold until it reaches 128 zones ( 250 pc ) on a side .",
    "this procedure enables us to study the velocity dispersion as a function of scale . for each box of a given size",

    "similarly , the thermal velocity dispersion @xmath61 is computed by replacing @xmath62 with the local sound speed @xmath63 .",
    "we prefer to use quantities directly related to pressure , so we set @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 for 1d thermal , turbulent , and total velocity dispersions , respectively ( see   [ discuss ] ) .",

    "what is new and remarkable is that the _ turbulent _ pressure is likewise in approximate pressure equilibrium ( fig .",

    "the desired net effect is to have a large - scale simulation on a coarse grid , indistinguishable from the one in which all motions are resolved down to parsec scales .",
    "our approach is inspired by the subgrid model described by springel ( 2000 ) , which assumes that turbulent motions below resolved scales produced by sn feedback can be represented by a second reservoir of internal energy of the gas , a term that helps to support the gaseous medium in the absence of substantial thermal support .",

    "this suggests that cosmological subgrid models should include a term for the turbulent pressure , rather than focusing on thermal pressure alone .",

    ", we infer a nearly constant gas scale height of 170 pc @xmath150 .    to estimate how the fraction of energy driving large scale motions ( @xmath138 ) scales with the sn rate , we distinguish between the small - scale , turbulent motions within boxes having 125 pc sides , as examined in   [ turbpres ] , and the bulk motion of these individual boxes .",
    "this amounts to comparing the sum of the kinetic energy contained in ( mass - weighted ) velocity dispersions inside the boxes ( @xmath151 ) and that from the center - of - mass velocities of the boxes themselves ( @xmath152 ) . using this procedure",

    "this does not contradict our earlier result that almost all the turbulent energy is contained on scales below @xmath1200 pc , because we were then discussing the kinetic energy spectrum in the midplane region only .",
    "in fact , if we confine our attention to the region with @xmath153 pc and compute the energy fraction in large - scale motions , we obtain significantly smaller values ( 0.084 , 0.065 , 0.149 , and 0.455 ) . in other words , most of the kinetic energy on large scales comes from the bulk motions at high altitudes : galactic winds . if we fit a straight line through the values of @xmath154 given in table  [ tbl_results ] , we find @xmath155 which is effectively a constant .",
    "to study the variation of turbulent pressure in our ism simulations , we compute @xmath76 in boxes of size ( 125 pc)@xmath6 taken from the midplane region ( @xmath153 pc ) of the four ism models .",

    "in contrast , much stiffer effective eoss were adopted in previous subgrid models .",
    "for example , springel ( 2000 ) used an eos of the form @xmath160 , obtained by assuming that all sn energy first goes into turbulent energy and then converts to thermal energy with an efficiency that depends specifically on gas density ( @xmath161 and @xmath162 in our notation ) . in the hybrid multiphase model developed by springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) , hot gas from sne delays radiative cooling and",
    "provides the necessary additional pressure . here",
    ", the effective eos was also stiffer than isothermal above a threshold density ( @xmath10.1 cm@xmath8 ) , where star formation was assumed to switch on .",
    "our result indicates that sn - driven turbulence does not naturally provide a stiff eos on 100200 pc scales but rather that the effective eos of the ism averaged over these scales is slightly sub - isothermal ( see   [ discuss ] for further discussion ) .",
    "the simulation results deviate slightly from the naive expectations based on constant @xmath156 , especially in the models for starbursts ( the 64x and 512x models ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath156 may be close to but not exactly a constant . combining the scaling relations we have found , we obtain @xmath163 or @xmath164 for a constant @xmath127 .",
    "hence , a smaller fraction of sn energy is used to drive kinetic motions as the sn rate ( and the mean gas density ) increases , although the dependence is weak . we must mention several caveats that may affect our conclusion .",
    "our ism simulations do not include magnetic fields or self - gravity of gas , which can change the structure and the pressure distribution of the medium , especially in the dense regions . in principle , unphysical cooling of numerical origin may be important , particularly in the 64x and the 512x models .",
    "this would occur at the interfaces between hot and cold gas , which are inevitably wider than the physical value , and so contain more gas at intermediate temperatures between @xmath165  k and @xmath110  k that is subject to strong radiative cooling than they physically should ( e.g. , mac low et al .",

    "<S> feedback from massive stars is one of the least understood aspects of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a suite of vertically stratified local interstellar medium ( ism ) models in which supernova rates and vertical gas column densities are systematically varied based on the schmidt - kennicutt law . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations have a sufficiently high spatial resolution ( 1.95 pc ) to follow the hydrodynamic interactions among multiple supernovae that structure the interstellar medium . at a given supernova rate , we find that the mean mass - weighted sound speed and velocity dispersion decrease as the inverse square root of gas density . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of thermal and turbulent pressures is nearly constant in the midplane , so the effective equation of state is isobaric . in contrast , across our four models having supernova rates that range from one to 512 times the galactic supernova rate , the mass - weighted velocity dispersion remains in the range 46  km  s@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , gas averaged over @xmath1100 pc regions follows @xmath2 with @xmath3 , indicating that the effective equation of state on this scale is close to isothermal . </S>",
    "<S> simulated emission lines have widths of 1018 km s@xmath0 , comparable to observed values . in our highest supernova rate model , </S>",
    "<S> superbubble blow - outs occur , and the turbulent pressure on large scales is @xmath44 times higher than the thermal pressure . we find a tight correlation between the thermal and turbulent pressures averaged over @xmath1100 pc regions in the midplane of each model , as well as across the four ism models . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a subgrid model for turbulent pressure based on analytic arguments and explicitly calibrate it against our stratified ism simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the subgrid model provides a simple yet physically motivated way to include supernova feedback in cosmological simulations . </S>"
