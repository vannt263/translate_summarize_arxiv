    "( 2010 ) , the size of a present galaxy is not uniquely determined by the spin parameter of its host halo at @xmath15 or any specific redshift , rather it is a cumulative consequence of the angular momentum evolution of its parent halo and star formation .",
    "the size of a galaxy is largely determined by the rotational states of its host halo when the galactic star formation rate was high .",
    "we use the specific angular momentum of the main progenitor of a halo at the epoch ( @xmath129 ) when its half stellar mass was assembled to take into account this integral effect .",
    "note , the exact choice of the redshift only changes our result quantitatively but not qualitatively .    in fig .",
    "[ udg_dwarf_zf ] , we present the distributions of the specific angular momenta @xmath130 of the progenitor halos at @xmath129 and galaxy ages @xmath122 for the model udgs and dwarf counterparts . clearly , compared with the typical dwarfs , the specific angular momenta of the model udgs are larger by a factor of 2.5 at @xmath129 . also as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ udg_dwarf_zf ] , the udgs are indeed much younger with a median age of 7.1  gyr , compared with the typical dwarfs which have a median age of 9.6  gyr .",
    "further , these suggest that it is indeed the combination of the late formation of udgs and high - spins of the host halos that result in the large sizes of udgs .",
    "therefore , the high - spin tail origin of udgs proposed by @xcite is not a complete story to explain the formation of udgs .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is that the number density profile of udgs is flat towards the center in the observed clusters , quite different from that of the typical dwarfs .",
    "one possible reason may be that the udgs fell into the clusters later than the typical dwarfs .",
    "we examine it in fig .",
    "[ age_dis ] by comparing the distributions of the infall - time @xmath131 ( the time at which a galaxy was accreted into a cluster ; @xmath132  gyr corresponding to @xmath15 ) of the two dwarf populations in the 10 simulated clusters . as expected that the infall - time of the model udgs is on average much later than that of the dwarf counterparts , with a median value of @xmath133  gyr and @xmath134  gyr for the model udgs and dwarf counterparts , respectively .",
    "therefore , the lack of udgs in the inner regions of clusters as shown in fig .",
    "[ snd ] , as well as lack of the tidal disruption features in observations are the natural consequences of this late infall - time .     of the progenitor halos ( upper panel ) at @xmath129 and galactic ages @xmath122 ( lower panel ) for the model udgs ( red histogram ) and dwarf counterparts ( black histogram ) , respectively . ]     for the udgs ( red ) and their dwarf counterparts ( black ) in the clusters , respectively . ]",
    "as a special subset of low surface brightness population , udgs draw much attention recently because they are as faint as the typical dwarf galaxies , yet have the sizes similar to those of the @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the origin of udgs is a mystery : are they the genuine dwarf galaxies with extremely large sizes or failed @xmath0 galaxies ?",
    "we use galaxy formation models ( guo et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) to study this special galaxy population .",
    "the predicted properties of udgs in the clusters and groups ( where most of the udgs are discovered ) agree very well with the observational results , including the abundance , number density profile , color distribution , and morphology , etc .",
    "our model predicts about 4 and 24 udg candidates in the local group and local volume analogues , two systems , respectively .",
    "when searching for such candidates in the local group and local volume with existing observational data , we find that the numbers of udgs in these two systems agree remarkably well with the model predictions .",
    "we demonstrate that udgs are genuine dwarf galaxies and can naturally emerge from the @xmath11cdm model .",
    "it is the combination of the later formation of udgs and the relatively larger spins of their host halos that results in the more extended feature of this particular population .",
    "the lack of udg candidates in the inner regions of clusters and the lack of tidal disruption features can be naturally explained by the later infall of the udgs .",
    "compared to the typical dwarf galaxies , udgs tend to reside in the low density regions consistent with their later formation .",
    "however , in the fields where there is no environmental effect , udgs are redder than the typical dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is because the udgs are more extended and the star formation ceases when the densities of the gas disks drop below a certain threshold .",
    "the red colors of udgs suggest that it is even harder to detect udgs than the typical dwarf galaxies .",
    "fortunately , the model predicts only 7% of dwarf galaxies in clusters and 14% in fields are identified as udgs , suggesting that it will not significantly affect the global luminosity function at the faint end , neither the conditional luminosity functions .",
    "although most of udgs are discovered in dense environments , we anticipate to discover a much higher fraction in under - dense regions in the future .",
    "we thank prof .",
    "karachentsev i. d. for his helpful discussion on the udg candidates in the local volume .",
