    "when the magnetic field is tilted away from the anisotropy axis , calculations based on gl theory show that the screening currents tend to flow in approximately elliptical paths around the vortex cores and parallel to the layers@xcite .",

    "_ et al.__@xcite showed that the free energy of a mixed lattice formed by vortices parallel to the c axis and vortices inclined at some angle from the c axis is lower than the free energy of a deformed inclined lattice .",

    "the qualitative variation of the vortex chain spacing is consistent with gl theory though the vortex spacing is closer than predicted . for higher perpendicular fields we see that the variation of the vortex chain spacing is slower than predicted , resulting in a higher vortex density in the chain .",
    "this accommodation of a higher vortex density may be related to the observed vortex coalescence in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "the second vortex configuration consists of in - plane flux channels crossed by perpendicular abrikosov vortices .",
    "the observed deformation of the pinned abrikosov vortices is a sign for the interaction between the abrikosov vortices and the flux channels .",
