    "in the past two decades , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) has been established as a powerful method for studying strongly correlated electron systems.@xcite in dmft , a quantum lattice model for interacting electrons is mapped onto an effective single impurity model with a self - consistently determined bath . to study the multi - band lattice hamiltonian or systems with strong spatial fluctuations such as two dimensional models , one needs to map the original hamiltonian onto effective multi - band impurity models,@xcite or onto a cluster hamiltonian with many impurities.@xcite for dmft and its extensions , the core is the solution of the impurity or cluster model for green s functions , or equivalently , for the self - energies.@xcite the efficiency of solving the quantum impurity or cluster models is essential for the applicability of dmft and its extensions .    due to its obvious importance ,",
    "fast and accurate method for solving impurity and cluster models has been the goal of intensive research activities since the development of dmft . in this area , various quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods , such as hirsch - fye algorithm@xcite and strong@xcite / weak - coupling@xcite continuous time qmc are among the most powerful and widely used methods .",
    "they are numerically exact and can treat multi - band impurity models and the multi - impurity cluster models.@xcite however , these qmc methods can not reach zero temperature and the dynamical correlations on real frequency axis are produced through numerical analytical continuation , which introduces additional errors.@xcite numerical renormalization group method@xcite can produce accurate low energy properties for single impurity model , but the computational cost increase exponentially with the number of orbitals or impurities.@xcite the full exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite and the lanczos method@xcite are relatively fast and easy to implement .",
    "however , at present , the total number of sites of the impurity / cluster model is constrained to about 9 for ed and 15 for lanczos.@xcite this limits the energy resolution in the resulting spectral function .    besides these more established methods , there have been attempts to develop new impurity / cluster solvers that are focused on the efficiency for complex impurity models , allowing for approximations . among them",
    "are the weak coupling@xcite or strong coupling@xcite perturbation theory , fluctuation - exchange approximation,@xcite non - crossing approximation,@xcite gutzwiller approximation,@xcite double time green s function ( gf ) equation of motion ( eom ) method,@xcite superperturbation method,@xcite extended recursion in operator space,@xcite and the distribution ed method,@xcite _ etc_. recently , two methods appear to be able to go beyond the limitations in qmc , nrg and ordinary ed .",
    "one is the ed algorithm based on natural orbitals,@xcite and the other is the hierarchical equation of motion method.@xcite these two methods seem promising in dmft applications , but their implementations are complicated and the computational costs are relatively high .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present a new impurity solver which is approximate but can be improved systematically . in this new method ,",
    "the bath degrees of freedom are split into the low energy and the high energy parts .",
    "the influence of the low energy bath to the impurity is treated exactly using the traditional ed method .",
    "while the influence of the high energy bath is treated afterwards using an approximate gf eom truncation scheme , that is , the alloy analogy approximation ( aaa).@xcite this idea is realized by using the standard basis operator ( sbo ) and its gf eom method,@xcite which is originally designed for extending the random phase approximation in the gf eom formalism to the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model .",
    "here we use it to derive a non - perturbative approximation on top of ed of a small system containing the impurity and @xmath1 bath sites .",
    "we hope that this method can combine the advantage of ed , that is , high speed and being systematic , with that of gf eom approach , that is , being flexible and giving continuous spectral function .",
    "our benchmark calculation shows that this method is fast and can produce qualitatively correct spectral function using one bath site @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , this method is suitable for dmft study of more complicated models of strongly correlated electrons , expecting reasonable results in a limited calculation time .    in the rest part of this paper , we first present the formalism in section ii .",
    "the results of benchmarking calculations are presented and compared with ed and nrg results in section iii . in section iv , we discuss the method and its possible extensions and applications . in section",
    "v , a brief summary is given .",
    "in this part , we derive the formalism of the standard basis operator gf eom method . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the single band hubbard model on a bethe lattice in the infinite coordination limit .",
    "the dmft equation for this system can be obtained analytically and has been solved by many other established methods .",
    "it is an ideal system for benchmarking a new solver .",
    "the hamiltonian of the single band hubbard model on bethe lattice reads @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the creation and the annihilation operators of a spin-@xmath6 electron on site @xmath7 , respectively .",

    "the hybridization function is defined as @xmath14 with its counter part on the matsubara frequency axis , @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are connected by the analytical continuation and the hilbert transformation as below , @xmath18 we split the continuous bath degrees of freedom into two parts , a discrete part with @xmath19 and a continuous part with @xmath20 . here @xmath1 is the number of discrete bath sites which will be treated by ed .",
    "their respective hybridization functions are @xmath21 correspondingly , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    given a full continuous hybridization function @xmath16 , we first identify @xmath1 discrete bath modes to define @xmath24 according to some importance criteria . the impurity problem composed of the impurity site and these @xmath1 bath sites are diagonalized first .",
    "the influence of the residual continuous bath @xmath25 is regarded as a modification to the ed result and is treated by approximate method .",

    "the calculation and storage of @xmath31 is expensive .",
    "this could hinder the practical applications of this approach . in this work ,",

    "for the parameterization of the discrete bath modes , we fit the low energy part of the full hybridization , which is important for the accurate description of the kondo resonance in the metallic phase ( see below ) .",
    "in accordance with the splitting of bath , @xmath34 is also split into two parts , @xmath35 to integrate ed and gf eom in a coherent way , we use the sbo formalism proposed by haley.@xcite suppose @xmath36 has been diagonalized and let @xmath37 and @xmath38 be the eigen energy and eigen state of @xmath36 , respectively .",

    "its evolution with @xmath10 is shown in fig.4 . at @xmath147 , the exact @xmath188",

    "this is contradict to the fermi liquid theory at such a low temperature .",
    "when @xmath10 is close to @xmath214 , a gap opens with a small resonance peak standing inside the gap .",
    "the gap is fully formed at about @xmath215 , completing the mott metal - insulator transition .",

    "we first discuss the convergence of our results with respect to increasing @xmath1 , the number of bath sites in @xmath36 . comparing @xmath188 among @xmath226 to @xmath32",
    ", it is found that apparently it does not show the expected convergence .",
    "this is mainly because the finite size effect in @xmath36 will influence the final result , by adding poles in the residual hybridization function @xmath201 .",
    "therefore , for the real frequency spectral function , our solver produces an effective broadening for the ed results . on the other hand ,",
    "the matsubara gf converges quickly to the exact curve as @xmath1 increases .",
    "note that by construction , our method will be exact in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the way of convergence can be understood from eq.([eq:30 ] ) : at those frequency points where the fitting is perfect @xmath227 , our result equals to ed result because @xmath228 . for a given @xmath28",
    ", it is empirically observed that there are @xmath28 different @xmath229 s where @xmath230 , meaning @xmath28 different frequencies where @xmath231 is identical to ed values . with increasing @xmath28 , @xmath232",

    "this problem , as well as the temperature dependence of @xmath234 curve can be partly traced back to the approximations used to simplify the self - consistent calculation of the averages @xmath137 , eq.([eq:28 ] ) .",
    "we expect that by replacing this approximation with the full self - consistent solution , the temperature dependence will be improved .",
    "third , we discuss possible improvement that we can make in the future . in the approximations of gf , the spin flip process ignored in the derivation",
    "can be taken into account without additional numerical effort .",
    "on the computation side , our calculations for @xmath192 takes only seconds on a pc .",
    "increasing @xmath28 will lead to much slower computation and larger storage requirement .",
    "however , we expect that the odd number of @xmath235 and @xmath236 can be reached with ease , which may give better description of both the kondo resonance and the hubbard peaks",
    ". the check of the convergence of results with respect to odd @xmath1 will be done later . also ,",
    "with full self - consistent calculation of the averages @xmath237 , we expect better description of the temperature dependence will be achieved .",
    "in this work , we develop and benchmark a new impurity solver for dmft , based on the eom of double time gf of sbo s . applying this method to the anderson impurity model",
    ", we obtain qualitatively correct results for the real frequency spectral function @xmath188 , the quasi - particle weight @xmath9 , and the matsubara gf . we applied this method to the one band hubbard model on bethe lattice through dmft and obtained qualitative description for the mott transition .",
