    "since its development in the beginning of the @xmath0th century , general relativity has been the most successful theory to describe the gravitational interaction .",
    "nevertheless , several problems arise when one tries to construct models in agreement with observational data in the classical approach . among such problems we can mention , for instance ,",
    "the cosmological constant problem@xcite , the cosmic coincidence@xcite and the dark sector@xcite - whose existence has been until today inferred only via its gravitational effects . while these are still open issues in cosmology nowadays , the prediction of an initial singularity for our universe@xcite is a crucial pathology from general relativity .    notwithstanding the cosmic censorship conjecture@xcite , there is no doubt that general relativity must be properly corrected or even replaced by a completely new theory .",
    "this demand is necessary to solve the issue of the presence of the initial singularity predicted by classical general relativity . in this context",
    ", the initial conditions from which our universe has evolved should depend crucially on the adopted version of the theory to describe the dynamics around the singularity .",
    "one of the most important features of our universe as inferred by observational data is the high degree of homogeneity and isotropy on large scales .",
    "however , when we consider a homogeneous and isotropic model filled with baryonic matter , we find several difficulties by taking into account the primordial state of our universe . among such difficulties",
    ", we can mention the horizon and flatness problems @xcite . although the inflationary paradigm@xcite allows to solve problems like these , inflationary cosmology does not solve the initial singularity problem .    during the last decades , bouncing models@xcite have been considered in order to circumvent the problem of the initial singularity predicted by general relativity",
    ". such models ( as @xcite-@xcite ) might provide attractive alternatives to the inflationary paradigm once they are able to solve the horizon and flatness problems , and justify the power spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations inferred by observations .    in the framework of bouncing cosmologies",
    ", it has been shown@xcite that curvature perturbations develop an almost scale invariant spectrum if the contracting phase is dominated by a dust - like fluid and the perturbations are generated by quantum vacuum fluctuations .",
    "however , in @xcite it was shown that the bardeen potential @xcite grows larger than 1 at the bounce and this inconsistent behaviour can be avoided by a suitable gauge choice .    in this paper",
    "we consider a brane world scenario@xcite where a non - compact timelike extra dimension is introduced @xcite . at low energies general relativity",
    "is recovered but at high energy scales significant changes are introduced into the gravitational dynamics and the singularities can be removed@xcite .",
    "while spacelike extra dimensions theories have received more attention in the last decades@xcite , studies involving extra timelike dimensions have been considered@xcite despite the fact that propagating tachyonic modes or negative norm states may arise due to timelike extra dimensions .",
    "these modes have been regarded as problematic once they might violate causality@xcite by considering interactions among usual particles .",
    "issues like the exceedingly small lower bound on the size of timelike extra dimensions@xcite , the imaginary self - energy of charged fermions induced by tachyonic modes  which seems to cause disappearance of fermions into nothing  and the spontaneous decay of stable particles induced by tachyons with negative energy are major difficulties@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in order to address the cosmological constant problem in kaluza - klein theories@xcite or reconcile a solution of the hierarchy problem with the cosmological expansion of the universe@xcite , timelike extra dimensions have been considered . on the other hand , it has been shown in @xcite that the appearance of massless ghosts in an effective four - dimensional theory can be avoided by considering topological criteria in kaluza- klein theories with extra compactified time - like dimensions .",
    "moreover , the avoidance of propagating tachyonic or negative norm states can also be achieved by considering a non - compact timelike extra dimension@xcite , which is the case in the models of this paper .    in section  [",
