    "conformal field theories in @xmath6 dimensions with a boundary of codimension one have interesting general properties , which have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of such field theories is that the conformal group in the @xmath6 dimensional space is broken from @xmath7 down to @xmath8 in the presence of the boundary .",
    "the unbroken conformal generators are those which leave the boundary invariant . in @xcite ,",
    "correlation functions for general boundary conformal field theories where constructed by symmetry considerations and by deriving a boundary operator product expansion . due to the reduced conformal symmetry ,",
    "these correlation functions are generally less constrained than in conformal field theories without a boundary .",
    "there are examples for conformal field theories of this type in which there are additional degrees of freedom at a defect or boundary .",
    "such impurity theories were studied for instance in the context of matrix descriptions of compactified five - branes @xcite , and also in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "recently , karch and randall @xcite proposed an ads / cft duality for d3/d5 brane systems whose near - horizon limit is @xmath9 with d5 branes wrapping an @xmath10 submanifold .",
    "they conjecture the dual field theory to be a four - dimensional @xmath11 yang - mills theory interacting with a three - dimensional conformal field theory in such a way as to preserve the common conformal symmetries .",
    "the three - dimensional degrees of freedom were proposed to be the holographic description of modes living on the d5-brane on which there is `` locally localized gravity '' .    within this context , there are two different scenarios : in the first , all of the d3 branes intersect the d5 branes .",
    "the dual field theory is then expected to contain a defect on which the three - dimensional theory lives . in the second scenario , some of the d3 branes end on the d5 branes , allowing for the interesting possibility of having two four - dimensional conformal field theories with different central charges coupled at a common boundary to a three - dimensional conformal field theory .    in the defect scenario ,",
    "the ads / cft correspondence was subsequently investigated in detail by dewolfe , freedman and ooguri @xcite .",
    "these authors explicitly construct the lagrangian of the dual field theory , which at the classical level preserves a @xmath12 conformal symmetry .",
    "the bulk component is a @xmath3 , @xmath1 super yang - mills theory , half the modes of which are coupled to a defect @xmath3 , @xmath2 hypermultiplet . in the construction of @xcite , the bulk modes are coupled to the defect modes in a manner preserving half the bulk supersymmetries by defining the defect in @xmath13 , @xmath1 superspace . in analogy to earlier results in @xcite , the defect locus is written as a condition on both a spatial coordinate , @xmath14 , and the grassmann coordinate , @xmath15 .",
    "evaluated at the defect , bulk @xmath13 superfields become @xmath13 , @xmath2 superfields which can be directly coupled to defect degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath12 symmetries of the supergravity dual strongly suggest that the conformal invariance of the classical theory is preserved by quantum corrections .",
    "there are also arguments in the context of matrix theory which suggest conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "partial field - theoretical arguments for conformal invariance were given in @xcite , and a proof was given for the abelian version of the model which has no bulk interactions .    in this paper",
    "we shall revisit the defect model considered in @xcite .",
    "we also construct other similar models preserving at least @xmath5 , @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "in addition to the defect case , where there are no boundary conditions , we also consider boundaries with suitable supersymmetric boundary conditions .",
    "we shall write both bulk and defect / boundary terms in @xmath5 , @xmath2 superspace .",
    "in addition to being compact and making many of the unbroken symmetries manifest , this notation has the distinct advantage that non - renormalization theorems are more transparent due to the existence of chiral superfields not present in @xmath16 , @xmath2 language .",
    "furthermore in @xmath5 , @xmath2 language it is easy to write feynman graphs with bulk - boundary interactions .",
    "a similiar procedure for coupling four dimensional supersymmetric actions to higher dimensional ones was developed in @xcite in the context of phenomenological model building .",
    "we begin by considering an abelian bulk @xmath5 vector multiplet with half the degrees of freedom coupled to charged @xmath5 , @xmath2 chiral multiplets at a defect ( or boundary ) in such a way that @xmath5 , @xmath2 superconformal invariance is classically preserved .",
    "for the boundary case , we obtain an additional @xmath2 chern - simons term as a boundary term of the @xmath1 action .",
    "we then derive a callan - symanzik equation by considering the superconformal transformation properties of the 1pi action in @xmath5 , @xmath2 superspace . in the abelian case , the bulk contribution to the action is free , and when studying the renormalization properties of the 1pi action , it is sufficient to consider the @xmath2 theory since all vertices live on the boundary or defect .",
    "the callan - symanzik equation enables us to show that the beta function vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory , such that the @xmath5 , @xmath2 superconformal symmetry is preserved by quantum corrections .",
    "a crucial ingredient in the proof of quantum conformal invariance is the absence of quantum corrections involving the chern - simons term .",
    "such a term can not contribute to the local superconformal transformation of the quantum action since its local form is not gauge invariant .",
    "this implies the absence of the gauge beta function .",
    "nevertheless the boundary or defect fields acquire an anomalous dimension in this @xmath5 model , which does not affect superconformal invariance .    in the defect case",
    "no boundary conditions are imposed on bulk fields , whereas in the boundary case we impose neumann boundary conditions , which - in contrast to dirichlet conditions - allow for coupling the electrically charged boundary degrees of freedom to the bulk fields .",
    "we expect mirror symmetric models with dirichlet boundary conditions to exist as well . as far as the conformal invariance of the models considered here is concerned",
    ", it does not matter whether one has a defect or a boundary .",
    "we emphasize that , unlike the defect model , the boundary model we construct does not correspond to a d3/d5 system , which would require dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting as a toy model and is a first step towards considering models in which there are different bulk central charges on opposite sides of the boundary .",
    "such conformal field theories might be expected to exist as holographic duals of supergravity configurations discussed in @xcite in which two @xmath17 backgrounds with different curvature are separated by an @xmath18 submanifold .",
    "we also consider the abelian defect model of @xcite , as well as its boundary version .",
    "this model is a bulk @xmath3 theory with half the degrees of freedom coupled to a charged @xmath3 , @xmath2 hypermultiplet living on the defect . using @xmath5 , @xmath2 superspace , we derive the callan - symanzik equation for this model and show that the beta functions and anomalous dimensions vanish . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar proof was given in component language using power counting and symmetry arguments superspace approach , we are in fact able to show that for the elementary defect fields , even the logarithmic divergences are absent , such that these fields do not acquire anomalous dimensions .",
    "however composite operators may still have anomalous dimensions , which we do not consider here . ] .",
    "finally we consider the non - abelian version of the defect model of @xcite , whose conformal invariance has not been previously demonstrated . in the non - abelian case ,",
    "the analysis of potential quantum corrections is more involved , since the bulk action is no longer free .",
    "assuming unbroken @xmath3 , @xmath2 supersymmetry , we argue that the beta functions of this theory vanish as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the embedding of , superspace in @xmath5 , @xmath1 superspace in the presence of a boundary or defect .",
    "moreover we decompose the @xmath5 , @xmath1 vector multiplet under @xmath5 , @xmath2 supersymmetry . in section 3",
    "we construct the action for a free abelian @xmath5 , @xmath1 vector multiplet in the bulk coupled to a charged @xmath5 , @xmath2 chiral multiplet on a boundary or defect .",
    "we investigate the superconformal transformation properties of the quantized version of this model , derive its callan - symanzik equation and show that its beta function vanishes . in section 4 , we consider the model of @xcite with @xmath3 super yang - mills theory in the bulk coupled to a @xmath3 , @xmath2 charged hypermultiplet at the defect or boundary .",
    "for the abelian version of this model we show that this model is not renormalized , using the superconformal transformation properties of the 1pi action again . in section 5",
    "we consider the non - abelian version of this model and demonstrate its conformal invariance assuming unbroken @xmath3 , @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "our aim is to couple four - dimensional theories with @xmath5 or @xmath3 supersymmetry to a three - dimensional boundary theory at @xmath14 .",
    "the super poincar symmetries of the four - dimensional bulk are broken by boundary conditions and defect or boundary couplings .",
    "for the purpose of coupling the bulk and boundary or defect actions , and for computing quantum corrections , it is convenient to write the four - dimensional bulk contribution to the action in a language in which only the preserved @xmath5 , @xmath2 symmetry is manifest . to this end",
    "it is necessary to know the decomposition of the higher dimensional multiplets under the lower dimensional supersymmetry .",
    "we begin by showing how to embed @xmath5 , @xmath2 superspace into @xmath5 , @xmath1 superspace . for this purpose",
    "we perform a twofold coordinate transformation in @xmath5 , @xmath1 superspace , @xmath19 first , we define real spinors , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as @xmath22 each real spinor is an irreducible representation of the three - dimensional lorentz group @xmath23 . subsequently , we rearrange them in the complex spinors @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 as we will see shortly , setting @xmath27 yields a @xmath5 , @xmath2 superspace .    in the absence of central charges , the @xmath3 , @xmath28 supersymmetry algebra is @xmath29 the coordinate transformation ( [ thetatr ] , [ theta12 ] , [ trafo2 ] ) corresponds to a redefinition of the four - dimensional @xmath5 supersymmetry generators such that @xmath30 .",
    "we define the new supersymmetry generators by @xmath31 where @xmath32 in terms of these new generators the algebra acquires the form",
    "@xmath33 here we have made use of the fact that the pauli matrices @xmath34 are symmetric while @xmath35 is antisymmetric .",
    "the algebra now splits into two @xmath5 , @xmath2 superalgebras , one generated by @xmath36 , the other by @xmath37 .",
    "both superalgebras are connected via the generator @xmath38 .",

    "we start from the decomposition of the vector multiplet @xmath51 under @xmath13 , @xmath1 which is given by an expansion in @xmath60 @xcite , @xmath61 where the @xmath13 chiral and vector multiplets @xmath62 and @xmath63 have the expansions @xmath64 while the bosonic components @xmath65 of @xmath62 and @xmath66 of @xmath63 are singlets under the global @xmath67 r symmetry , the fermions @xmath68 of @xmath62 and @xmath69 of @xmath63 form a @xmath67 doublet .",

    "when both ends are pinned on the boundary , the free 4d chiral and gauge vector propagators are given by @xmath342 where @xmath343 these expressions are the @xmath5 , @xmath2 version of results obtained in @xcite for the 4d/5d case in component form .",
    "the power of the momentum in the denominator is reduced as compared to standard three - dimensional propagators , which makes feynman graphs potentially more divergent than in a pure three - dimensional theory .",

    "the calculation is analogous to the standard calculation of the one - loop contribution to the 4d gauge propagator given for instance in @xcite .",
    "the bphz approach allows to show in a simple way that the one - loop contribution to the chern - simons term in @xmath2 vanishes due to supersymmetry .",
    "the action principle of the bphz approach gives @xmath345 where the contributions relevant here are @xmath346 ( [ ce ] ) corresponds to the graph shown in fig .  2 with the external legs removed as appropriate for a 1pi contribution .",
    "this ensures that this 1pi contribution is three - dimensional .",
    "performing the two functional derivatives with respect to @xmath56 we obtain @xmath347 applying @xmath348 to both sides of ( [ kkk ] ) then gives @xmath349 since @xmath350 is independent of the grassmann variables .",
    "a standard one - loop calculation gives a contribution to the 1pi action . by virtue of ( [ propqv ] ) and ( [ propb ] ) , we find @xmath352 for the super - feynman graph of fig .  3 .",
    "since @xmath353 is logarithmically divergent , it follows that @xmath354 in general .",
    "in addition to the expression ( [ loopcontr1 ] ) , in the @xmath3 model we find the following one - loop contribution to the 1pi action @xmath353 , see fig .",
