    "in 1879 , edwin hall ran a current through a gold foil and discovered that a transverse voltage was induced when the film was exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field .  @xcite the ratio of this hall voltage to the current density is the hall resistivity . for paramagnetic materials ,",
    "the hall resistivity is proportional to the applied magnetic field and hall measurements give information about the concentration of free carriers and determine whether they are holes or electrons .",
    "magnetic films exhibit both this ordinary hall response and an extraordinary or anomalous hall response that does not disappear at zero magnetic field and is proportional to the internal magnetization : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hall resistance , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the ordinary and anomalous hall coefficients , @xmath4 is the magnetization , and @xmath5 is the applied magnetic field . the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) is the consequence of spin - orbit coupling and allows an indirect measurement of the internal magnetization .    despite the simplicity of the experiment",
    ", the theoretical basis of the ahe is still hotly debated and a source of conflicting reports .",
    "@xcite different mechanisms contribute to the ahe : an intrinsic mechanism and extrinsic mechanisms such as skew - scattering and side - jump contributions .",
    "the intrinsic mechanism is based solely on the topological properties of the bloch states originating from the spin - orbit - coupled electronic structure as first suggested by karplus and luttinger .",
    "@xcite their approach gives an anomalous hall coefficient @xmath3 proportional to the square of the ordinary resistivity , since the intrinsic ahe itself is insensitive to impurities .",
    "the skew - scattering mechanism , as first proposed by smit ,  @xcite relies on an asymmetric scattering of the conduction electrons by impurities present in the material .",
    "not surprisingly , this skew scattering contribution to @xmath3 is sensitive to the type and range of the scattering potential and , in contrast to the intrinsic mechanism , scales linearly with the diagonal resistivity .",
    "the presence of impurities also leads to a side - step type of scattering , which contributes to a net current perpendicular to the initial momentum .",
    "this is the so - called side - jump contribution , whose semi - classical interpretation was pointed out by berger .",
    "@xcite however , it is not trivial to correctly account for such contributions in the semiclassical procedure , making a connection to the microscopic approach very desirable .",
    "the early theories of the ahe involved complex calculations with results that where not easy to interpret and often contradicting each other .",
    "@xcite the adversity facing these theories stems from the origin of the ahe : it appears due to the interband coherence and not just due to simple changes in the occupation of bloch states , as was recognized in the early works of luttinger and kohn .",
    "@xcite nowadays , most treatments of the ahe either use the semiclassical boltzmann transport theory or the diagrammatic approach based on the kubo - streda linear - response formalism .",
    "the equivalence of these two methods for the two - dimensional dirac - band graphene system has recently been shown by sinitsyn _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite who explicitly identified various diagrams of the more systematic kubo - streda treatment with the physically more transparent terms of the semiclassical boltzmann approach .",
    "it is therefore important to also obtain a similarly cohesive understanding of the ahe in other systems such as the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin - polarized electron gas with rashba spin - orbit interaction in the presence of pointlike potential impurities , where a series of previous studies has led to a multitude of results with discrepancies arising from the focus on different limits and/or subtle missteps in the calculations .",
    "@xcite it is the purpose of this paper to review and analyze the previous attempts and to provide a detailed analysis of all contributions to the ahe in a two - dimensional electron gas . since we have already demonstrated the equivalence of the kubo - streda formalism and the semiclassical boltzmann approach with respect to skew scattering in the two - dimensional electron gas in a previous paper ,  @xcite we will focus here exclusively on the diagrammatic formalism based on the kubo - streda treatment .    the outline of the article is as follows .",
    "we start by reviewing and commenting on previous studies of the ahe in the two - dimensional electron gas in sec .",
    "[ sec : previoustreatments ] , where we compare them with our results and discuss the discrepancies and their possible origins . in sec .",
    "[ sec : aheconductivity ] we present details of our calculation within the diagrammatic kubo - streda formalism . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simplelimits ] we provide simple analytical limits of all terms of the anomalous hall conductivity and discuss the full evaluation in sec .",
    "[ sec : numericalevaluation ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "currently there are several publications on the ahe in two dimensional systems reaching different quantitative predictions even in the same limits .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we present a calculation with conclusions that are in disagreement with some previous studies . on such a background",
    "we believe that previous articles have to be discussed in some details .",
    "below we review the history of the problem and explain why we think the subject has to be reconsidered .",
    "a first study of the ahe in two dimensional systems was done by culcer _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite who calculated only the intrinsic contribution to the hall conductivity for a wide class of two - dimensional systems , including the rashba two - dimensional electron gas as a special case .",
    "the intrinsic contribution plays a special role in the theory of the ahe because it is not related to the scattering of electrons but is rather caused by the unusual trajectories of electrons under the action of the electric field .",
    "however , the disorder contributions can also be important and further insight was needed in the quest for a quantitatively rigorous theory of the dc - ahe .    the first attempts to understand the disorder effects where done independently by two groups ,  @xcite each employing different approaches .",
    "dugaev _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite used the version of the kubo formula , which expresses the hall conductivity in terms of the causal green functions .",
    "the intrinsic contribution appears as a result of calculations with bare green functions , while disorder effects renormalize the quasi - particle life time and the current vertex .",
    "this approach is formally rigorous and is similar to the one we adopt in our work .",
    "however , our final results are quantitatively different from those found in ref .",
    "due to a subtlety in the calculation of the vertex at the fermi surface which was later corrected in the appendix of ref . .",
    "starting with the equation for the renormalized vertex @xmath6 and with the assumption that the density of impurities is low , they find correctly that @xmath7 to leading order in @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "however , such a term gets multiplied by an equivalent divergent term within the kubo formula leading to a non - zero contribution to the ahe conductivity to zeroth order in @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast to the previous quantum mechanical approach , sinitsyn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite employed the semiclassical wave - packet approach focusing only on the understanding of the side - jump contribution and formulating the semi - classical problem in a gauge invariant form .",
    "this work  @xcite intentionally avoids a discussion of the skew - scattering contribution due to the asymmetry of the collision term kernel , which is also an important mechanism of the hall current and can even be parametrically similar to all other contribution  @xcite in the case of gaussian correlations .",
    "therefore , the work in ref .   is meant as an intuitive introduction into the physics of the anomalous velocity and the side - jump effect , but does not offer a rigorous quantitative comparison even in the considered limit of smooth disorder potential .",
    "subsequently two papers by liu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the problem using the keldysh technique for linear transport .",
    "the keldysh technique leads to the quantum boltzmann equation for the diagonal elements of the density matrix in momentum space when only elastic scattering events are considered . in the steady state limit of a weak electric field",
    "this equation can be written as follows : @xmath10=\\hat{i}_{\\mathrm col}(\\hat{\\rho}({\\bf    p } ) ) \\ , , \\label{qbe}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 contains all disorder dependent terms that become zero when @xmath12 is the density matrix in thermodynamic equilibrium and @xmath13 is the disorder free part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the  hat \" means that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are matrices in the band index space .",
    "the term containing the electric field is called the driving term . in the linear - response approximation",
    "it only depends on the equilibrium part of the density matrix .    to start with eq .",
    "( [ qbe ] ) is correct and is also the starting point of the pioneering work by luttinger  @xcite and therefore one can compare it directly with steps taken by liu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite luttinger s approach was to split the density matrix into equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts @xmath16 where @xmath17 is linear in electric field .",
    "it is this part of the density matrix that is responsible for nonzero currents . for weak disorder potential @xmath18",
    ", luttinger looked for @xmath17 as a series in powers of the disorder potential .",
    "he found that this series starts from the term of the order @xmath19 @xmath20 as pointed out by luttinger , the leading order term @xmath21 does not contribute to the hall effect and is only responsible for the longitudinal diffusive current .",
    "the term @xmath22 was identified with skew scattering .",
    "this term , however , is parametrically very distinct and vanishes in the approximation of purely gaussian correlations of disorder fourier components ; therefore , luttinger went to next order and calculated the term @xmath23 .",
    "he found a number of contributions , whose physical meaning he did not clarify .",
    "the main conclusion was that at this order both the diagonal and off - diagonal parts of the density matrix become nonzero and contribute to the hall conductivity , which becomes formally independent on the strength of disorder @xmath18 in the dc limit , although disorder has to be included in the intermediate calculations .    comparing this with the first work of liu and lei  @xcite",
    "we find that they determined self - consistently only the off - diagonal part of the density matrix in band index .",
    "this is , however , not enough for a rigorous quantitative result because the diagonal part of the @xmath24 contribution has been known to be important since luttinger s pioneering work .    in their next effort liu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the problem of 2d rashba systems in small gap semiconductor materials , in which a projection to the conduction band leads to extrinsic type spin - dependent contributions . in this work they noticed that the diagonal part is important and calculated it numerically .",
    "for the driving term in eq .",
    "( [ qbe ] ) liu _ et al . _",
    "assume that @xmath25 is just a diagonal equilibrium fermi distribution .",
    "this would be correct if one was using the basis of the eigenstates of the _ full _ hamiltonian with impurities .",
    "however , both liu _ et al . _ and luttinger work in the chiral basis of the disorder free hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "in this basis the _ equilibrium _ state density matrix is no longer diagonal and can also be written as a series in powers of the disorder potential : @xmath26 luttinger has shown that in order to properly evaluate the non - equilibrium part @xmath27 one should include the second term @xmath28 of the expansion of the equilibrium density matrix in eq .",
    "( [ reqe ] ) into the driving term of eq .",
    "( [ qbe ] ) . this was not done in ref .",
    "and therefore we believe that their work is incomplete due to such omission .",
    "we also note that the correction of order @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ reqe ] ) leads to the hall current contribution , which was identified in the semiclassical approach  @xcite as the anomalous distribution correction and if omitted leads to errors of factors of two in the typical side - jump type contributions.@xcite in the kubo formula approach , neglecting this correction would be equivalent to the unjustified omission of an important subset of feynman diagrams .",
    "@xcite within the calculation presented here all these terms are present .",
    "inoue _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the ahe contribution using the same approach we use focusing on the limit of both subbands being occupied and , in addition to the disorder that we consider , incorporating magnetic impurities in the model hamiltonian .",
    "they found that for paramagnetic impurities the hall conductivity vanishes .",
    "our more general calculations confirm this result .",
    "however , we point to one important difference in its derivation . in both cases",
    "the dc - limit kubo formula , where the conductivity is expressed via retarded and advanced greens functions , has been employed to calculate the hall conductivity . as was shown by streda",
    "@xcite , this version of the kubo formula contains two parts : @xmath30 a contribution from the fermi surface and @xmath31 a contribution from all states of the fermi sea . the latter part is less known because it does not appear in the expression for the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "@xcite calculated only @xmath30 and indeed we find that for their choice of parameters the second part of the conductivity @xmath31 vanishes , explaining the agreement with our results . in a more general analysis ,",
    "beyond the limit of weak spin - orbit and zeeman couplings , we find a non - vanishing @xmath31 .",
    "our work provides the missing estimate of @xmath31 and extends the calculations of inoue _ et al . _",
    "@xcite    finally , the latest work on the subject is by onoda _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the authors used the keldysh technique , which they reformulated in a way appropriate for multiband problems in a gauge invariant formalism .",
    "they also derived a self - consistent equation , which is the analog of the standard quantum boltzmann equation and solved it numerically .",
    "unfortunately , lacking a full understanding of the details of the numerical procedure and the starting equations being very formal within a non - chiral basis , a detailed discussion of their approach can not be performed here .",
    "however , being devoted to the same model , the final results can be compared directly with the possible discrepancies arising from the different limits considered in the disorder distributions in which @xmath8 and the disorder strength are two independent parameters in their calculations .",

    "our results confirm neither of those predictions .",
    "we find that for the rashba model with randomly placed delta - function impurities the leading part of the skew - scattering vanishes identically when the fermi level is above this resonance point .",
    "although skew scattering could still appear in higher order terms of the born series , we expect these contributions to be small because they are of higher order in @xmath34 . on the other hand , onoda _",
