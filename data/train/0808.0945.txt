    "triple gauge boson couplings constitute a sensitive probe of nonstandard interactions @xcite . in particular , triple",
    "neutral gauge boson couplings ( tngbc ) @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , vanish when the three gauge bosons are on mass shell and bose symmetry and lorentz invariance are simultaneously satisfied @xcite .",
    "eventhough these vertices do not reflect directly the non - abelian nature of the electroweak gauge group , since the yang - mills sector does not induce them at the tree or one - loop level , they constitute a window to new physics @xcite .",
    "these vertices must be induced by loop effects in any renormalizable theory since they do not possess a renormalizable structure . at the one - loop level",
    ", they can be generated only by fermionic triangles @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "they are rather small , of order @xmath8 @xcite , but new heavy quark generations may enhance them by about one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of possible tngbc @xmath0 and @xmath1 have reached an accuracy at the few percent level at the tevatron @xcite , even better than the accuracy obtained for nonstandard deviations of the @xmath9 couplings @xcite .",
    "persuasive arguments within the effective lagrangian approach indicate that tngbc are not expected to be larger than @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "indirect limits on these vertices have been obtained from the muon @xmath11 value , the known bound on the electron electric dipole moment @xcite and the measurement of the rare decay mode @xmath12 obtained at lep @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath13 has been studied also at the energies expected in future linear colliders in order to search for its sensitivity to the tngbc through the effects of @xmath14 polarization and initial state radiation @xcite , as well as possible cp - violating effects in the decay mode @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath16 has been studied previously in connection to the determination of the number of light neutrino species @xcite and its possible electric and magnetic moments @xcite , as well as in the search of extra neutral gauge bosons @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study the sensitivity to the tngbc in the process @xmath17 at the next generation of linear colliders , namely the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "we expect to get better limits on the anomalous @xmath6 couplings through the @xmath18 channel because its larger branching ratio induces a cross section for @xmath16 about a factor 3 larger than the combined rates for @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath20 is also competitive with respect to @xmath21 production at the lhc because the inclusive nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath21 cross section are quite large at high photon transverse momenta in the sm and reduce the sensitivity to the tngbc @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we will obtain in the present paper that the next generation of @xmath22 colliders may reach in fact sensitivities that are close to the sm predictions for the tngbc . in this respect ,",
    "our study can be considered complementary to previous studies on the tngbc @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we present the calculation of the cross section for the process with anomalous couplings @xmath0 and @xmath1 and , finally , we summarize our results and conclusions in sec .",

    "( 1 ) by the following replacements :    @xmath26    the form factors @xmath27 are dimesionless functions of the @xmath28 momenta and in order to avoid violation of partial wave unitarity , generalized dipole form factors will be considered @xcite    @xmath29    we will assume that the new physics scale @xmath30 is above the collision energy @xmath31 .",
    "the feynman diagrams that contribute to the process @xmath32 are depicted in fig .",
    "1 . we will consider only the effect due to the anomalous @xmath33 vertices for various ilc / clic energies and luminosities .",
    "the sm contribution to this process would arise from initial state radiation coming from the @xmath22 beams and photons emitted from a virtual @xmath34 boson exchanged in the @xmath35-channel . in order to suppress the sm contribution we impose the cuts @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the polar angle of the photon with respect to the beam direction @xcite .",

    "( 2 - 4 ) and take the appropriated photon propagator into account . we do not reproduce the analytical expressions here because they are rather similar to the terms given in eqs .",
    "( 5)-(8 ) .",
    "we expect that the contribution arising from the @xmath6 anomalous vertices is enhanced in the process @xmath2 at high energies with respect to the sm contribution @xcite , as it is shown in fig .",

    "we derive those values of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , which would give rise to a deviation from the sm prediction at the level of two standard deviations @xmath49 c.l . ) . as it is shown in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the couplings @xmath50 do not contribute to the total cross section @xcite and the calculation of the sensitivity bounds is facilited by the fact that the cp - conserving and cp - violating couplings @xmath51 do not interfere .",
    "even more , cross sections and sensitivities are nearly identical for equal values of these couplings @xcite . for simplicity , we shall take then one of the vertex contributions at the time . in figs . 3 and 4 we present the dependence of the sensitivity limits of the @xmath52 vertices with respect to the collider luminosity for three different values of the c.m .",
    "a similar dependence is obtained for the sensitivity limits of the @xmath53 vertices with respect to the collider luminosity . in figs .",

    ", we have found that the process @xmath60 at the high energies and luminosities expected at the ilc / clic colliders can be used to probe for nonstandard @xmath6 vertices . in particular",
