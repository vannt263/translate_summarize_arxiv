    "the dynamical understanding of the confinement - deconfinement phase transition as a function of the temperature in a nonabelian gauge theory , such as quantum chromodynamics , is a topic of current interest .",
    "the so - called polyakov loop , given by the trace of the thermal wilson line , has been proposed as an order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of pure @xmath11 yang - mills gauge theory on an euclidian spacetime lattice have verified this proposal by computing the renormalized polyakov loop as a function of the temperature @xcite ( see fig.4 therein ) . because of its special role as an order parameter of the confinement - deconfinement transition effective lagrangian in the polyakov loop variable have been formulated @xcite .",
    "there is also ongoing activity to interpret within such a framework the results of lattice qcd simulations at finite temperature including dynamical quarks @xcite .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "the polyakov loop variable is a complex number given by 1/3 the trace of a special unitary @xmath12 matrix ( i.e. @xmath13 ) . according to this definition as an arithmetic mean of three unitary eigenvalues ( with product equal to @xmath14 ) only restricted complex values are possible for the polyakov loop variable , and",
    "this feature should be respected in the construction of any effective lagrangian .",
    "we will show here in section 2 that the allowed region of @xmath13 lies inside the unit circle and is bounded by a quartic curve with three cusp points at the cube roots of unity : @xmath15 .",
    "further geometrical properties of this so - called trace figure of @xmath11 , such as its enclosed area and the length of its circumference will also be derived .",
    "the question about the domain of their mean eigenvalues naturally generalizes to the other compact lie groups with a complex fundamental representation .",
    "the simple and simply connected , compact lie groups ( without any abelian @xmath16-factors ) are particularly interesting , since for these the trace figure ( i.e. locus of the mean eigenvalues ) will not be the entire unit disk in the complex plane . in section 3",
    "we analyze the special unitary groups @xmath17 and show that their trace figures are bounded by hypocycloids with cusp points at the @xmath18-th roots of unity .",
    "section 4 deals then with the spin groups spin@xmath1 ( the two - sheeted covering groups of the special orthogonal groups @xmath19 ) which possess a complex fundamental representation of dimension @xmath20 . the exceptional lie group @xmath2 with its complex fundamental representation of dimension 27 will be analyzed in section 5 . for the compact lie groups @xmath21 with only selfconjugate representations the mean eigenvalues are necessarily real and restricted to the interval @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "if furthermore the center of the group @xmath22 contains a factor @xmath23 , it follows by continuity that the whole interval @xmath7 $ ] gets filled by the mean eigenvalues of @xmath21 .",
    "this leaves for the exceptional lie groups @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 with trivial center the question about a lower bound on their mean eigenvalues",
    ". we will determine in section 6 these lower bounds for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the negative rational numbers @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the simplest among the compact and complex lie groups is the special unitary group @xmath11 , with numerous applications in theoretical physics .",
    "the question about the domain in the complex plane filled by the mean eigenvalues of @xmath11-matrices is readily answered .",
    "the complex numbers of the form : @xmath24 can be rewritten in terms of the three unitary eigenvalues @xmath25 of @xmath26 , which are subject to the constraint @xmath27 , as : @xmath28 evidently , any such complex number @xmath29 lies inside the unit disc : @xmath30 . in order to determine the extremal boundary values we eliminate one of the two angles by imposing the zero - derivative condition : @xmath31 , which gives @xmath32 .",
    "reinserting this relation leads already to the following parameterization of the boundary curve : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an angle running from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the gray - shaded area in fig.1 corresponds to the region in the complex plane which gets filled by the mean eigenvalues of @xmath11-matrices . besides a dihedral symmetry @xmath37 one",
    "observes cusps at the cube roots of unity @xmath38 which obviously correspond to the center of the compact complex lie group @xmath11 : @xmath39 .",
    "we can also give a purely algebraic description of the boundary curve in fig.1 .",
    "eliminating @xmath40 from the real part of eq.(3 ) and inserting the solution of that quadratic equation into the squared imaginary part gives : @xmath41 where the signs @xmath42 correspond to the two branches for @xmath43 in both the upper and the lower halfplane .",
    "after some further elementary transformations we arrive at the result that the trace figure of @xmath11 ( i.e. the locus of its mean eigenvalues ) is the region : @xmath44 inside the unit disc @xmath45 which is bounded by a @xmath46 curve",
    ". with the help of the parameterization in eq.(3 ) we can now compute several other geometrically interesting properties of the trace figure of @xmath11 .",
    "the enclosed area amounts to : @xmath47 and the length of its boundary curve is : @xmath48 the radius of the largest circle that fits into the trace figure , determined by the minimum of @xmath49 , is easily found to be : @xmath50 for the lie group @xmath11 of rank two , one has the special situation that the complex number @xmath51 ( subject to the constraint eq.(5 ) ) represents uniquely a conjugacy class of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the normalized invariant integral for class functions can be converted into a two - dimensional integral over the trace figure : @xmath52 the square - root type weighting function originates from the weyl determinant @xcite expressed in terms of the coordinates @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the region described in eq.(5 ) , where the radicand is positive .",
    "the measure is @xmath55 .",
    "the previous considerations can be straightforwardly generalized to the higher special unitary groups @xmath57 .",
    "the complex numbers : @xmath58 can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath59 ( independent ) unitary eigenvalues @xmath60 as : @xmath61 for an extremal boundary point we eliminate all but one angle through the zero - derivative conditions : @xmath62 , @xmath63 which give @xmath64 .",
    "this implies @xmath65 , and with that we obtain the following parameterization of the boundary curve in terms of @xmath66 : @xmath67 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the grey - shaded areas in figs.2 , 3 and 4 correspond to the regions in the complex plane filled by the mean eigenvalues of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70-matrices , respectively . in each case",
    "one observes in addition to a dihedral symmetry @xmath71 cusp points at the @xmath18-th roots of unity which reflect the discrete center subgroup @xmath72 .",
    "the area enclosed by the trace figure of @xmath0 comes out as a rational multiple of @xmath3 , namely : @xmath73 and the circumference of its boundary curve , parameterized in eq.(12 ) , is : @xmath74 the radius of the largest circle that fits into the trace figure of @xmath0 , determined by minimum of @xmath75/n^2 $ ] , is also readily found to be : @xmath76 when extrapolating to large dimensions , @xmath77 , one realizes that the trace figure tends to fill out the whole unit disc , @xmath78 , whereas its circumference becomes significantly longer than the unit circle , @xmath79 .",
    "this difference arises from the @xmath18 oscillations of the boundary curve between @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the special case of",
    "@xmath68 we can furthermore employ the trigonometric identities : @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and get the algebraic characterization : @xmath84 of the region filled by the mean eigenvalues of @xmath68-matrices . finally , it is interesting to note that the curves parameterized in eq.(12 ) are the so - called hypocycloids .",
    "these hypocycloids are constructed by unrolling a circle of radius @xmath85 inside the unit circle and recording the motion of a point on the boundary of the small circle ( of radius @xmath85 ) .",
    "among the classical simple and simply connected compact lie groups @xcite the spin groups spin@xmath1 ( defined as the two - sheeted universal covering groups of the special orthogonal groups @xmath19 ) are distinguished by the property of possessing a complex fundamental representation of dimension @xmath20 .",
    "the reason for that is that in these particular dimensions the ( even ) real clifford algebras used to construct the spin groups are isomorphic to complex matrix algebras @xcite . in order to analyze the mean eigenvalues : @xmath86 for spin@xmath1",
    "it is sufficient to consider the elements in the maximal torus of the form @xcite : @xmath87 the @xmath88 basis elements @xmath89 obey the anticommutation relations @xmath90 and therefore generate the real clifford algebra @xmath91 . since only even products occur for @xmath92 in eq.(18 ) we can rewrite it as : @xmath93 in terms of the @xmath94 basis elements @xmath95 which by themselves generate the real clifford algebra @xmath96 . the complexified clifford algebra in one dimension lower is known to be isomorphic to the algebra of complex @xmath97 matrices : @xmath98 . from its @xmath99 generators @xmath100 , @xmath101 one can construct the matrix @xmath102 which anticommutes with all these @xmath99 generators and furthermore has the square @xmath103 .",
    "when taking the trace of @xmath92 in this matrix representation of @xmath96 one finds readily that all traces of products of @xmath104-matrices vanish , except for @xmath105 .",
    "this leads to the following parameterization of the mean eigenvalue of a complex spin@xmath1-matrix : @xmath106 in order to find the boundary of the region inside the unit disc which is covered when the @xmath107 angles @xmath108 vary between @xmath35 and @xmath36 we search for the extremum of @xmath109 under the condition that @xmath110 is kept constant .",
    "the convenient method of the lagrange multiplier leads to the condition that all the @xmath107 angles @xmath108 have to be equal on the boundary of the trace figure of spin@xmath1 : @xmath111 with that knowledge one can also give the algebraic description : @xmath112 of the region in the complex plane covered by the mean eigenvalues of spin@xmath1 . the grey - shaded areas in figs.2 , 5 , and 6 show these regions for the cases spin@xmath113 , spin@xmath114 and",
    "spin@xmath115 , respectively . one observes cusps at the fourth roots of unity @xmath116 which correspond to the discrete center subgroup @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "of course , the wellknown isomorphism spin@xmath118 also shows up in our analysis of mean eigenvalues . the area enclosed by the trace figure of spin@xmath1",
    "is readily calculated to be : @xmath119 ( again a rational multiple of @xmath3 ) and the circumference of its boundary curve ( parameterized in eq.(21 ) ) is given by the integral : @xmath120 its first four values read : @xmath121 for large @xmath122 the area approaches now quickly zero , @xmath123 , whereas the circumference tends to @xmath124 .",
    "the radius of the largest circle contained in the trace figure of spin@xmath1 is : @xmath125 obtained by setting @xmath126 in eq.(21 ) .",
    "among the five exceptional lie groups there is exactly one candidate with a complex fundamental representation , namely @xmath2 with its ( defining ) 27-dimensional complex representation @xcite .",
    "the mean eigenvalue of an @xmath2-matrix is then given by the complex number : @xmath127 under the maximal compact subgroup @xmath128 of @xmath2 this 27-dimensional complex representation decomposes as @xcite : @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 denote the singlet , triplet and anti - triplet representations of @xmath11 . since @xmath133 is nothing but the character of the defining @xmath134-representation we can use this decomposition to express @xmath133 in terms of products of @xmath135-characters . introducing the abbreviation @xmath136 for the character of the @xmath131-representation of @xmath11 we get for the eigenvalue sum of an @xmath2-matrix : @xmath137 here , all six complex variables @xmath138 run around the unit circle . in order to get the boundary of the region covered by @xmath139",
    ", we impose the zero - derivative conditions @xmath140 .",
    "these allow us in a first step to eliminate half of the variables : @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "any further zero - derivative condition on the reduced expression for @xmath29 requires one of the three remaining variables to be a cube root of unity .",
    "we set @xmath144 , and get an expression which is symmetric under the exchange @xmath145 . setting finally @xmath146 with @xmath147",
    "we find the following parameterization of the boundary curve : @xmath148 where the signs @xmath42 correspond to the branches in the upper / lower halfplane .",
    "as an example , the parameter value @xmath149 gives the boundary point @xmath150 , @xmath151 on the negative real axis .",
    "fig.7 shows the trace figure of the complex exceptional lie group @xmath2 . besides the dihedral symmetry @xmath37 one observes again cusps at the cube roots of unity",
    "@xmath152 which reflect the center subgroup of @xmath2 : @xmath153 @xcite",
    ". the area of the grey - shaded region in fig.7 amounts to : @xmath154 ( again a rational multiple of @xmath3 ) and the circumference of the boundary curve is given by the ( elliptic ) integral : @xmath155 the radius of the largest circle contained in the trace figure of @xmath2 is : @xmath156 this largest circle meets the three boundary points : @xmath157 , ( @xmath158 ) and @xmath159 , ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "all the other simple and simply connected compact lie groups @xmath21 have only selfconjugate representations @xcite . therefore their mean eigenvalues @xmath160 are real and confined to the interval @xmath7 $ ] . in the cases @xmath161 , @xmath162 ( the symplectic groups ) , spin@xmath163 and @xmath164 with center subgroup @xmath165 @xcite of order @xmath166 , it follows immediately from continuity that the whole interval @xmath7 $ ] will be covered by the mean eigenvalues : @xmath167 .",
    "the same feature applies also to spin@xmath168 with center @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "the lower limit @xmath170 is in each case reached by the negative unit matrix contained in the center of these simple and simply connected compact lie groups .",
    "this leaves the exceptional lie groups @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 with trivial center @xcite as special cases since for them the ( trivial ) lower bound @xmath170 may not be reached . in the next section we determine the proper lower bounds on the mean eigenvalues for these three exceptional groups .",
    "we start with the exceptional lie group @xmath4 of rank two .",
    "its lowest dimensional nontrivial representation is the real @xmath171-representation ( i.e. the defining representation of @xmath4 ) and it decomposes under the subgroup @xmath11 as @xcite : @xmath172 this property allows us to write the mean eigenvalue of a @xmath4-matrix : @xmath173 in terms of the @xmath11-character as follows : @xmath174 from our analysis of @xmath11 in section 2 we can take over the inequality : @xmath175 , ( see also fig.1 ) and deduce from it that the allowed range for the mean eigenvalues of @xmath4-matrices is : @xmath176 we continue with the exceptional lie group @xmath5 of rank four .",
    "its lowest dimensional nontrivial representation is the real @xmath177-representation ( to be viewed as the defining representation of @xmath5 ) .",
    "it decomposes under the maximal compact subgroup @xmath178 of @xmath5 as : @xmath179 with @xmath180 the ( real ) octet representation of @xmath11 .",
    "this fact allows us again to write the mean eigenvalue of a @xmath5-matrix : @xmath181 in terms of @xmath11-characters as : @xmath182 with @xmath60 four complex variables running on the unit circle . by imposing the zero - derivative conditions @xmath183 we can eliminate two variables : @xmath184 , @xmath142",
    ". then we redefine @xmath185 in the reduced expression and the further zero - derivative condition @xmath186 fixes @xmath187 . finally , we set @xmath188 and get the quadratic expression : @xmath189 from which one can easily read off the lower bound .",
    "altogether this implies that the mean eigenvalues of @xmath5-matrices lie in the interval : @xmath190 the lower limit value @xmath9 has also been confirmed in numerical studies starting from eq.(40 ) .",
    "the most demanding case is that of the exceptional lie group @xmath6 of rank eight .",
    "the lowest dimensional nontrivial representation of @xmath6 is the real @xmath191-representation , i.e. the adjoint representation on its own lie algebra .",
    "it decomposes under the maximal compact subgroup @xmath192 as @xcite : @xmath193 where the adjoint @xmath194-representation of @xmath2 decomposes under @xmath195 as : @xmath196 the mean eigenvalue of an @xmath6-matrix : @xmath197 is proportional to the character of the @xmath191-representation and the decompositions eqs.(28,43,44 ) give us @xmath198 as a laurent - polynomial in eight ( unitary ) variables @xmath199 with integer coefficients . setting all these eight variables equal to each other : @xmath200 , @xmath201 , with @xmath202 , we get the expression : @xmath203 the sixth degree polynomial on the right hand side of eq.(46 ) is shown in fig.8 .",
    "one sees that within the interval @xmath202 its absolute minimum value @xmath204 is reached on the left boundary @xmath205 .",
    "having found this lower bound we can conclude that the allowed range for the mean eigenvalues of @xmath6 is : @xmath206 we note that one can equivalently eliminate half of the eight variables through zero - derivative conditions as @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and then go with the remaining four variables onto the diagonal : @xmath209 .",
    "this procedure leads to the same expression as in eq.(46 ) . the lower limit value @xmath10 has again been confirmed in numerical studies starting from the full eight - parameter form of @xmath210 .",
