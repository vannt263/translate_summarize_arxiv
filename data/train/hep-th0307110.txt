    "we present the dimensionless energy @xmath53 , the dimensionless magnetic dipole moment @xmath54 and the nodes @xmath55 of the higgs field for the solutions with @xmath20 winding number @xmath46 .",
    "we observe that the energy @xmath56 of an @xmath19-chain is always smaller than the energy of @xmath19 single monopoles or antimonopoles ( with infinite separation between them ) , i.  e.  @xmath57 . on the other hand @xmath56",

    "we observe an ( almost ) linear dependence of the energy @xmath56 on @xmath19 .",
    "this can be modelled by taking into account only the energy of @xmath19 single ( infinitely separated ) monopoles and the next - neighbour interaction between monopoles and antimonopoles on the chain . defining the interaction energy as the binding energy of the monopole - antimonopole pair , @xmath60 we obtain as energy estimate for the @xmath19-chain @xmath61 in fig .  1 we show this estimate for the energy , @xmath62 , together with the exact energy for chains with @xmath20 winding number @xmath63 .",
    "we note that the deviation of the estimated energy from the exact energy is indeed very small .    in table 2",
    "we list the possible decompositions of the @xmath19-chains into subchains of smaller length together with the total energy of the subchains ( at infinite separation ) .",
    "we observe that the energetically most favourable state is the @xmath19-chain .",
    "this supports our interpretation of the @xmath19-chain as an equilibrium state of @xmath19 monopoles and antimonopoles .",
    "we note , however , that there are other possible decompositions not included in the table .",
    "for example , the m - a - m - a - chain could be decomposed into a pair of a charge @xmath64 multimonopole and a charge @xmath65 anti - multimonopole .    to define the magnetic dipole moment for solutions with even @xmath19",
    ", we first transform to a gauge where the higgs field is constant at infinity , @xmath66 . from the asymptotic expansion @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath67 .",
    "thus the gauge field assumes the asymptotic form @xmath68 from which we read off the ( dimensionless ) magnetic dipole moment @xmath69 .",
    "solutions with odd @xmath19 have vanishing magnetic dipole moment , since in this case the function @xmath70 is odd under the transformation @xmath71 . consequently , the asymptotic form of the gauge potential can not contain terms like the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ magmom ] ) .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment also increases with increasing @xmath19 , as seen in table 1 . to obtain an estimate for the dipole moment we consider the magnetic charges as point charges located at the nodes of the higgs field , yielding @xmath72 with charges @xmath73 for monopoles and @xmath74 for antimonopoles , respectively .",
    "for comparison the estimated magnetic dipole moments are also given in table 1 .",
    "the deviation from the exact values is on the order of @xmath75% .    concerning the nodes of the higgs field we observe that the distances between the nodes increase with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "remarkably , the distances between the nodes do not vary much within a chain .",
    "for example , denoting the location of the nodes by @xmath55 in decreasing order we find for the chain with @xmath20 winding number @xmath52 from table 1 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    in fig .  2 we present the dimensionless energy density for the solutions with @xmath20 winding number @xmath63",
    "the energy density of the @xmath19-chain possesses @xmath19 maxima on the @xmath0-axis , and decreases with increasing @xmath79 .",
    "the locations of the maxima are close to the nodes of the higgs field , which are indicated by asterisks . for a given @xmath19",
    "the maxima are of similar magnitude , but their height decreases with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "( note that the scale for the @xmath47 solution is different compared to the @xmath80 solutions , and that the contour lines are distorted due to the different scaling of the @xmath79- and @xmath0-axis . )",
    "we have obtained new static axially symmetric solutions of the su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs theory which represent monopole - antimonopole chains .",
    "they are characterized by the @xmath20 winding number @xmath19 , which equals the number of nodes of the higgs field , and the total number of monopoles and antimonopoles . solutions with even @xmath19 carry no magnetic charge but possess a non - vanishing magnetic dipole moment , whereas solutions with odd @xmath19 carry unit magnetic charge but possess no magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the energy of these @xmath19-chains increases ( almost ) linearly with @xmath19 .",
    "we interpret the @xmath19-chains as equilibrium states of @xmath19 monopoles and antimonopoles .",
    "as shown long ago @xcite , the force between monopoles is given by twice the coloumb force when the charges are unequal , and vanishes when the charges are equal , provided the monopoles are at large distances .",
    "thus , monopoles and antimonopoles can only be in static equilibrium , if they are close enough to experience a repulsive force that counteracts the attractive coloumb force .",
    "in other words , @xmath19-chains are essentially non - bps solutions .",
    "to see this in another way let us rewrite the energy in the form @xmath81 the second term is proportional to the topological charge and vanishes when @xmath19 is even .",
    "the first term is just the integral of the square of the bogolmolnyi equations .",
    "thus , for even @xmath19 the energy is a measure for the deviation of the solution from selfduality .",
    "so far we have considered only solutions in the vacuum sector or the sector with unit topological charge . generalising the ansatz to @xmath82 winding number @xmath83 leads to new solutions , which carry topological charge @xmath84 if @xmath19 is odd , and to solutions in the vacuum sector if @xmath19 is even @xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath85 , @xmath50 solution has been constructed in an extended model @xcite , which includes the ymh theory as a special case .",
    "chains of @xmath85 multimonopoles and anti - multimonopoles will be presented elsewhere @xcite . for @xmath86",
    "a new phenomenon occurs .",
    "the zeros of the higgs field no longer form a set of isolated points . instead",
    "the higgs field vanishes on rings around the @xmath0-axis @xcite .",
    "( for odd @xmath19 the node at the origin persists ) .",
    "when the gravitional interaction is included , we anticipate a different behaviour for @xmath19-chains with finite magnetic charge and those with vanishing magnetic charge .",
    "for magnetically charged solutions a degenerate horizon may form at a critical value of the gravitional parameter , as observed for monopoles @xcite and multimonopoles @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "no formation of a horizon was found for the gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair @xcite .",
    "we expect that solutions analogous to the @xmath19-chains exists in weinberg - salam theory @xcite , generalizing the sphaleron - antisphaleron pair @xcite . the axially symmetric ansatz with @xmath82 winding number @xmath84 and @xmath20 winding number @xmath19 @xcite allows for ( multi)sphaleron  anti-(multi)sphaleron chains and solutions with rings of zeros ."
