    "the main probabilistic ingredient of our proof is the concentration of measure phenomenon combined with discretization , also used in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the majorization approach stems from the fact that it reduces the problem to the analysis of norms of matrices , which are @xmath255-lipschitz functions of the matrix ( with respect to the hilbert - schmidt norms ) , whereas the lipschitz constant of the shannon s entropy as a function of a state increases with the dimension .",

    "we remark that fawzi et al .",
    "@xcite obtained also more explicit constructions of matrices satisfying entropic uncertainty principles for @xmath0 being a power of @xmath318 , as their constructions can be efficiently performed by quantum circuits .",
    "however the number of measurements @xmath4 in their scheme is bounded from above by a polynomial in @xmath319 .",
    "following the strategy of @xcite , our theorem  [ prop : uncertainty ] can be directly applied to protocols of locking of the classical information in quantum states @xcite .",
    "our bounds for the average entropy , valid for large dimension @xmath0 and an arbitrary number of measurements @xmath4 , provide more precise estimations concerning the information leaked by a measurement from a quantum system used in an information locking scheme .",
    "in this work we analyzed truncations of @xmath35 random unitary matrices and obtained estimations , and for their norms .",
    "these results allowed us to study various entropic uncertainty relations providing the bounds for the sum of entropies describing information gained in two orthogonal measurements of any @xmath0-dimensional pure quantum state .",
    "our analysis reveals in particular that classical relations , known to be optimal in extremal settings , do not perform well in generic situations .",
    "for instance , the maassen  uffink bound ( [ mu ] ) averaged with the haar measure over the unitary group behaves asymptotically as @xmath320 .",
    "as the largest element of a random orthogonal matrix is typically larger by a factor of @xmath321 @xcite , the same bound averaged over the orthogonal group gives @xmath322 .",
    "these results can be compared with implications of the strong entropic uncertainty relation which , averaged over the unitary group gives a lower bound @xmath323 , which is close to the best possible one . although the exact value of the optimal constant @xmath108 is still unknown , the sandwich form ( [ sandw ] ) implies that @xmath324 .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that if @xmath1 is drawn from the haar measure on the unitary group @xmath3 and @xmath325 , then there exists a limit @xmath326    strong majorization entropic uncertainty relations can be also formulated for @xmath4 orthogonal measurements , determined by a collection of @xmath4 unitary matrices of order @xmath0 . making use of bounds for the norms of their submatrices we established an estimate ( [ multi ] ) , which implies that the sum of @xmath4 entropies behaves asymptotically as @xmath327 .",
    "this result , holding for an arbitrary number @xmath4 of measurements , is up to an additive constant compatible with the estimate ( [ sandw ] ) valid for @xmath328 .",
    "in particular it allows us to answer completely an open question by wehner and winter on asymptotic behavior of constants in entropic uncertainty relations for many measurements as the dimension of the underlying hilbert space tends to infinity .",
    "furthermore , these bounds can be used to quantify the information leaked due to measurements from a quantum system , in which information locking protocol is applied @xcite .",
    "a natural open question is to find more precise estimations for these additive constants determining the typical behavior of entropic uncertainty relations . to get tighter bounds for the averaged relation ( [ eqn : strong - relation ] ) one would need to improve the bounds for the average norms of the leading truncations of random unitaries .",
    "note that the bounds ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) and ( [ trun1 ] ) derived in this work can be considered as complementary : the former one holds for @xmath134 and an arbitrary @xmath329 $ ] , while the latter one works for any sizes @xmath140 and @xmath138 of the submatrix , but provides non - trivial estimates if @xmath140 is small with respect to the matrix size @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to believe that establishing a new family of bounds for the norms @xmath330 , which share advantages of both known results , would allow one to improve the quality of the asymptotic entropic uncertainty relations .",
    "we also mention that obtaining optimal bounds on norms of submatrices of a random unitary matrix seems to be an interesting problem in its own rights , with potential applications in random matrix theory and asymptotic geometric analysis .",
