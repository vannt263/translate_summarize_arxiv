    "gravitational lensing provides a new probe of the structure of high redshift galaxies through their absorption lines .",
    "a typical spiral galaxy at @xmath10 is usually too faint for detailed direct observations .",
    "however , when such an system gravitationally lenses a distant quasar , forming multiple images of the background source , spectra toward these images allow one to trace the kinematics along several lines of sight through the galaxy .",
    "decimetre wavelength observations of such systems ( i.e. spectra in the redshifted hi 21 cm and oh radio lines ) are particularly well suited to such studies since background sources typically show extended structure at these wavelengths , which allows a better sampling of the velocity field of the intervening galaxy .",
    "for example , chengalur , de bruyn & narasimha ( 1999 ) used westerbork synthesis radio telescope redshifted hi and oh spectra of the @xmath11 lens toward pks  1830 - 211 to estimate the rotation velocity of the absorbing galaxy .",
    "the relative strengths of the multiple oh radio lines ( when detected ) also allow one to trace the large scale distribution of molecular gas in the absorption system .",
    "however , the weakness of the oh transitions implies that they have only been detected in three absorbers at cosmological distance @xcite .",
    "one of the most well - known ( and well - observed ! ) gravitational lenses is the one at @xmath9 toward the source b0218 + 357 @xcite .",
    "the radio continuum consists of two images of a flat spectrum source ( components a and b ) , separated by 0.34@xmath12 , and a radio ring with a radius of 0.18@xmath12 @xcite ; this is the smallest known einstein ring .",
    "the background source is at a redshift of @xmath13 @xcite ; the high redshift of the lens and relatively low redshift of the source ( with respect to the lens ) imply that this system is an excellent candidate to determine the large scale geometry of the universe and the value of the hubble constant . in fact , vla monitoring has yielded a time delay of @xmath14  days between the two images , resulting in a hubble constant @xmath15  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations have so far not been able to accurately locate the centre of the lens galaxy and this positional uncertainty implies a far higher uncertainty in @xmath16 than that derived from the statistical errors quoted above @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 system has been a rich source of absorption lines , with a number of molecular species such as co , hco@xmath17 , hcn , h@xmath18co and h@xmath18o , as well as hi , already detected here @xcite .",
    "further , the difference between the rotation measures of components a and b has been measured to be @xmath19  rad  m@xmath20 and the optical spectrum of b0218 + 357 is highly reddened @xcite .",
    "all of these imply that the lens is an exceedingly gas - rich system ; indeed , recent hst observations @xcite have shown that the system is a late - type spiral galaxy .",
    "the original observations of the hi absorption profile @xcite were of low sensitivity and spectral resolution and hence could not resolve out the absorption feature .",
    "further , the full width between nulls of the hi profile was measured to be 75  km  s@xmath6 , somewhat small for a spiral galaxy at a moderate inclination , especially given the extended structure of the background continuum .",
    "we present here deep giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) oh and westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) hi observations of the @xmath0 system ; both the 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz oh lines were detected while strong limits were placed on the optical depth of the 1720  mhz oh transition .",
    "we also detect a wide component to the hi absorption , with a velocity spread of @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the observations and data analysis are discussed in section  [ sec : obs ] while the implications for the @xmath0 absorber are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "observations of the redshifted hi line toward b0218 + 357 were carried out with the wsrt on 21  june 1998 , with the new dzb correlator as the backend .",
    "a bandwidth of 2.5 mhz was used for the observations , centered at an observing frequency of 843.20  mhz and sub - divided into 256 channels .",
    "no taper was applied in the lag - to - frequency transform , yielding a velocity resolution of @xmath21  km  s@xmath6  ( channel resolution @xmath22  khz ) .",
    "12 telescopes were used for the observations .",
    "the standard calibrators 3c48 ( 30min , before ) and 3c286 ( 72min , after ) , were used to calibrate the absolute flux scale and the system bandpass ; their adopted flux densities are on the baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ) scale .",
    "the total on - source time was 11.7 hours .",
    "the gmrt oh observations of b0218 + 357 were initially carried out on the 17th and 27th of june , 2001 , with the standard 30 station fx correlator as the backend .",
    "a total bandwidth of 4 mhz was used for these observations , to include both the main oh transitions ( at rest frequencies of 1665.4018  mhz and 1667.3590  mhz ) .",
    "this was sub - divided into 128 channels , yielding a frequency resolution of @xmath23  khz ( i.e. @xmath24  km  s@xmath6 ) on each run .",
    "twenty three and seventeen antennas were available for the observations on the 17th and the 27th respectively , due to various debugging and maintenance activities .",
    "the standard calibrator 3c48 was used to carry out absolute flux and bandpass calibration .",
    "total on - source times were 3 and 5 hours on the first and second observing dates respectively .",
    "while the 4  mhz bandwidth observations were important for the initial detection of the oh lines , it was apparent that their relatively poor velocity resolution would not allow the positions or widths of the absorption features to be determined as accurately as in the case of the hi line ( note that the gmrt correlator allows a higher frequency resolution only at the cost of total bandwidth and the bandwidth of 4  mhz was necessary to include both oh features in the band ) .",
    "further observations ( each using a bandwidth of 1  mhz , i.e. a resolution of @xmath25  khz or @xmath26  km  s@xmath6 ) were hence separately carried out of the 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz features , on the 11th of october and the 27th of november , 2001 , respectively .",
    "21 antennas were available for each of these observations ; the total on - source times were @xmath27 hours and @xmath28 hours for the 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz observations respectively . absolute flux and bandpass calibration were carried out using 3c48 and 3c147 .",
    "finally , an attempt was also made with the gmrt to detect the 1720  mhz oh transition in the @xmath9 absorber .",
    "these observations were carried out on the 25th of november , 2001 , using a bandwidth of 1  mhz ( i.e. a resolution of @xmath25  khz or @xmath29  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "flux and bandpass calibration were again carried out using 3c48 and 3c147 .",
    "the total on - source time was @xmath30 3 hours , with 28 antennas .",
    "the data were converted from the telescope format to fits in all cases and then analyzed in aips using standard procedures .",
    "a careful inspection was initially carried out for rfi and sections showing evidence of interference were flagged out . for the wsrt data ,",
    "a simple average of the visibilities was made after bandpass calibration and the peak flux density read off from the image cube ; this resulted in the spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we note that b0218 + 357 is largely unresolved on wsrt baselines ; the spectrum represents the flux density averaged over 60 interferometers .",
    "a total of 6 baselines were not used in the averaging for various reasons . in the case of the gmrt observations , after phase and bandpass calibration , the continuum emission was subtracted by fitting a linear polynomial to the u - v visibilities , using the aips task uvlin .",
    "the continuum - subtracted data were then mapped in all channels and spectra extracted at the quasar location from the resulting three - dimensional data cube . in the case of the multi - epoch 4  mhz gmrt observations , the spectra of the two epochs were corrected to the heliocentric frame outside aips and then averaged together .",
    "-0.54 in -0.54 in -0.1 in    the flux density of b0218 + 357 was measured to be 1.520  jy ( at 843  mhz ) in the wsrt observations . in the case of the gmrt observations ,",
    "the flux density was measured to be 1.64  jy ( 17th and 27th of june ) , 1.54  jy ( 11th of october ) and 1.58  jy ( 27th of november ) at @xmath31  mhz and 1.66  jy at @xmath32  mhz ( 25th of november ) .",
    "note that all spectra of the 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz lines have been scaled here to a common flux density of 1.64  jy .",
    "earlier experience with the gmrt indicates that the flux calibration is reliable to @xmath33% , in this observing mode .",
    "the wsrt hi spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spectra][a ] ; the spectrum has been hanning smoothed and re - sampled and has a velocity resolution of @xmath34  km  s@xmath6  and an rms noise of @xmath34  mjy .",
    "two deep features can be immediately identified in the spectrum , besides a weak broad component .",
    "the peak optical depth is 0.05 , occuring at a redshift of @xmath35 .",
    "the total velocity spread of the absorption is @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the spectrum has a total velocity coverage of @xmath36  km  s@xmath6 ; only the central 400  km  s@xmath6  are shown here , for comparison with the high resolution oh spectra .",
    "we note that non - gaussian behavior was observed at two locations in the spectrum , near the edges of the band ( beyond the velocity range plotted in figure  [ fig : spectra ]  [ a ] ) ; these are likely to be due to low - level rfi .",
    "the final gmrt 4  mhz oh spectrum toward b0218 + 357 is shown in figure  [ fig:4mhz ] .",
    "the rms noise is 1.1 mjy , per 9.4  km  s@xmath6  channel ; the spectrum has not been smoothed .",
    "both oh transitions are clearly visible ; the peak absorption occurs at heliocentric frequencies of 988.56 mhz and 989.72 mhz , both implying a redshift @xmath37 .",
    "a wide shoulder can be seen in both absorption features , on the high frequency side of the principal feature .",
    "figures  [ fig : spectra][b ] and [ fig : spectra][c ] show the 1  mhz bandwidth gmrt spectra of the 1667  mhz and 1665  mhz oh lines .",
    "the rms noise values are 1.5  mjy and 1.6  mjy respectively , per 2.4  km  s@xmath6  channel ( the spectra have again not been smoothed ) .",
    "the high frequency shoulder of the 4  mhz spectrum is now resolved out in both spectra ; besides this , a wide absorption component can also be seen ( which is stronger in the 1667  mhz transition ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the 1667  mhz absorption line is @xmath38  km  s@xmath6 , while the ratio of the 1667  mhz and 1665  mhz equivalent widths is @xmath39 , as expected in optically thin conditions in thermal equilibrium .",
    "interestingly , this ratio is slightly larger at the low frequency edge of the two profiles ( at @xmath40  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the total velocity spread of both the 1665 and 1667  mhz lines is @xmath7  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the peak optical depth in the 1  mhz bandwidth spectra occurs at heliocentric frequencies of 988.575  mhz ( 1665  mhz transition ) and 989.717  mhz ( 1667  mhz transition ) , corresponding to redshifts @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "while the above redshifts are in marginal disagreement , figure  [ fig : spectra][c ] shows that the 1665  mhz line has two peaks of approximately the same depth , separated by @xmath43  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "if the second ( marginally weaker ) feature is used to compute the redshift , one obtains @xmath44 , in agreement with the 1667  mhz redshift ; the same value is also obtained by a gaussian fit to the 1665  mhz line .",
    "we will hence use this value for the redshift of the absorber , as it also agrees with that estimated from the 1667  mhz line .",
    "this is also in broad agreement with redshifts obtained from millimetre - wave transitions ( e.g. , @xmath45 , from the @xmath46co line ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that a measured difference between the redshifts of the four oh 18 cm lines can , in principle , be used to simultaneously measure variations in the fine structure constant @xmath47 , the ratio of electron mass to proton mass @xmath48 and the proton g - factor @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "finally , the gmrt spectrum of the 1720  mhz oh transition ( not shown here ) did not show any absorption .",
    "the rms noise was measured to be 1  mjy , after smoothing the spectrum to a resolution of @xmath50  km  s@xmath6 ; this yields a @xmath51 limit of 0.0018 on the optical depth in the 1720  mhz line , per 10  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the oh and hi profiles are broadly similar in that each absorption line consists of a primary component , a high frequency shoulder and a broad shallow trough ; this indicates that the lines originate in the same diffuse or dark cloud . while the total width of the hi absorption is wider than that of the oh lines ( @xmath8  km  s@xmath6  for the hi absorption against @xmath7  km  s@xmath6  for the oh ) , this is not too surprising since oh is believed to be more confined than hi in models of molecular clouds ( see , for example , figure  6 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is tempting to identify the two main features of the lines as stemming from absorption against the two point images a and b ; however , vlbi observations of the hi absorption @xcite have shown that it arises solely due to image a , while no absorption is seen against image b. similarly , the mm - wavelength molecular absorption lines are also only seen against image a and not against b @xcite .",
    "the two main features of the lines hence probably arise from the two vlbi components of image a ( patnaik et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) or possibly from multiple clouds along the line of sight to one of these components , while the broad but shallow trough is likely to stem from absorption against source components in the radio ring .    for an optically thin cloud in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the oh column density of the absorbing gas @xmath52  is related to the excitation temperature @xmath53 and the 1667 mhz optical depth @xmath54 by the expression ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the covering factor of the absorber . here",
    ", @xmath52   is in @xmath2 , @xmath53 in k and @xmath57  in km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the integrated optical depth in the 1667 mhz line is @xmath58  km  s@xmath6 ; thus , @xmath59  @xmath2 .",
    "vlbi observations @xcite have shown that no hi absorption is seen against component b ; similarly , the co and hco@xmath17 absorption are only seen against component a @xcite ; the covering factor @xmath56 is thus likely to be close to 0.4 .",
    "next , the oh excitation temperature @xmath53 can not be directly estimated for cosmologically distant objects such as the @xmath9 absorber . in the galaxy ,",
    "oh emission studies have shown that this temperature may be as low as @xmath60  k , with similar values for the hco@xmath17 line ( @xmath61 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the excitation temperatures of the redshifted hco@xmath17 lines in the four known high redshift absorbers have been found to be _ higher _ than @xmath62 , the redshifted cmb temperature ; it is thus quite likely that the oh excitation temperature too is higher in these systems . given that the @xmath0 absorption system is believed to originate in a late - type spiral disk @xcite , we will , in the absence of additional information , assume @xmath63  k , a typical temperature in dark clouds in the milky way , to estimate the oh column density .",
    "this yields @xmath64  @xmath2 ; note that this is slightly different from the value @xmath65",
    "@xmath2 , obtained by kanekar & chengalur ( 2002 ) from the lower resolution ( @xmath24  km  s@xmath6 ) spectrum .",
    "the present value is obtained from the 1  mhz bandwidth , @xmath66  km  s@xmath6  resolution spectrum .",
    "the oh column density of the absorber can be used to estimate the hco@xmath17 and h@xmath18 column densities , by the relations @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this yields @xmath69  @xmath2 , in good agreement with that measured from the hco@xmath17 line ( @xmath70  @xmath2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also obtain @xmath71 , which is , interestingly enough , in excellent agreement with the value of gerin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( @xmath72  @xmath2 ) , using the @xmath73 line , but a factor of 20 smaller than the estimate of @xmath74  @xmath2 , from the co absorption @xcite .",
    "we next attempt to decompose the hi absorption into its components by simultaneously fitting gaussians to the three main absorption features ; we do not fit to the oh profiles as the signal - to - noise ratio of the wide component in the high resolution oh spectra is too low to get a stable fit . while it is quite unlikely that the net result of absorption against the components of the ring is indeed a gaussian ,",
    "the decomposition will be used solely to quantify the velocity spread of the absorption profile , in order to estimate the rotation velocity of the absorbing galaxy .",
    "we note that the results do not change significantly if we assume that the broad feature has a `` top - hat''-like shape ( while retaining a gaussian shape for the two deep components ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra][a ] shows the 3-gaussian fit to the hanning smoothed hi absorption profile ; here , the hanning smoothed ( and re - sampled ) 7  km  s@xmath6  resolution spectrum is plotted as solid squares while the 3-gaussian fit is shown as a solid line .",
    "attempts were also made to fit only two gaussians to the profile .",
    "the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra][a ] shows the best 2-gaussian fit ; this fails to reproduce the wide absorption trough on either side of the two main components .",
    "two - component fits were thus found to leave clear residuals , indicating that a 3-component fit was indeed necessary .",
    "the parameters of the 3-gaussian fit are listed in table  1 ; it should be pointed out that the fit to the broad absorption has only a weak ( @xmath75 ) significance .",
    "deeper hi observations would be useful to test the reality of this feature , which would be very interesting if it were shown to indeed arise against the radio ring .",
    "since the ring is only prominent at low frequencies ( it is almost undetectable at at 22  ghz but has more flux than image  b in the 1.67  ghz evn observations of patnaik et al .",
    "2003 ) , deeper hi observations would provide the best sampling of the large scale kinematics of the lens galaxy .",
    "finally , the fwhm of the broad absorption component is @xmath76  km  s@xmath6 ; more relevant , the spread between points on the spectrum at which this component falls below the @xmath77 level is @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this gives the total spread of the absorption against the radio ring .",
    "the 5  ghz vlbi image of patnaik et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ( see also @xcite ) shows that image b lies roughly at the centre of the ring while the two components of image a lie outside the ring , at a distance of @xmath78  mas .",
    "the fact that the narrow absorption features due to the components of image a lie quite close to the centre of the broad absorption trough implies that these components lie close to the kinematic minor axis of the absorbing galaxy ; it is thus difficult to draw strong conclusions about the rotation curve of the galaxy from these absorption lines .",
    "the observed lack of absorption against component b makes it likely there is a `` hole '' in the hi distribution near the centre of the @xmath0 absorber , similar to the situation in the milky way and other local spirals . as mentioned above , the wide hi absorption is likely to stem from absorption toward source components in the einstein ring .",
    "this implies that the line - of - sight rotation velocity at 0.18@xmath12 from the lens centre ( i.e. at the location of the source components in the ring ) is approximately 70  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "since the lens is at an inclination of around 25 degrees , the rotation velocity is @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 , fairly reasonable for an ordinary spiral galaxy .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have detected both the 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz oh transitions in absorption in the @xmath79 gravitational lens toward b0218 + 357 and have also found a wide absorption component in the hi profile ( at low significance ) .",
    "the redshifts of peak oh absorption are in good agreement with that of the hi , as well as with those of molecular lines discovered earlier in the absorber .",
    "the hi absorption is spread over 140  km  s@xmath6  while both oh lines have a velocity spread of @xmath7  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the oh column density of the absorber is @xmath80  @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we estimate that the rotation velocity of the galaxy is @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 , at around 1.5  kpc from the centre .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt that made these observations possible .",
    "gmrt is run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
