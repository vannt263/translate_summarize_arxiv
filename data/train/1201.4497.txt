    "the second law of newtonian mechanics states that if @xmath0 is the force acting on a point particle of mass @xmath1 and @xmath2 is its acceleration , then @xmath3 . in a sense ,",
    "the physical meaning of this expression lies in its tacit assumptions , namely that forces are vectors , that is , elements of a vector space , and as such they sum .",
    "this experimental fact embodied in the second law is what prevent us from considering the previous identity as a mere definition of _",
    "force_.    coming to the study of the rigid body , one can deduce the first cardinal equation of mechanics @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the affine point of the center of mass , @xmath6 is the total mass and @xmath7 is the resultant of the external applied forces .",
    "this equation does not fix the dynamical evolution of the body , indeed one need to add the second cardinal equation of mechanics @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are respectively , the total angular momentum and the total mechanical momentum with respect to an arbitrary fixed point @xmath11 . naively adding the applied forces might result in an incorrect calculation of @xmath10 .",
    "as it is well known , one must take into account the line of action of each force @xmath12 in order to determine the _ central axis _ , namely the locus of allowed application points of the resultant .",
    "these considerations show that applied forces do not really form a vector space .",
    "this unfortunate circumstance can be amended considering , in place of the force , the field of mechanical momenta that it determines ( the so called _ dynamical screw _ ) .",
    "these type of fields are constrained by the law which establishes the change of the mechanical momenta under change of pole @xmath13 an analogy between momenta and velocities , and between force resultant and angular velocity is apparent considering the so called _ fundamental formula of the rigid body _ , namely a constraint which characterizes the velocity vector field of the rigid body @xmath14 the correspondence can be pushed forward for instance by noting that the concept of _ instantaneous axis of rotation _ is analogous to that of _ central axis_. screw theory explores these analogies in a systematic way and relates them to the lie group of rigid motions on the euclidean space .",
    "perhaps , one of the most interesting consequences of screw theory is that it allows us to fully understand that angular velocities should be treated as vectors applied to the instantaneous axis of rotation , rather than as free vectors .",
    "this fact is not at al obvious .",
    "let us recall that the angular velocity is defined through poisson theorem , which states that , given a frame @xmath15 moving with respect to an absolute frame @xmath16 , any normalized vector @xmath17 which is fixed with respect to @xmath15 satisfies @xmath18 in the original frame @xmath16 , where @xmath19 is unique .",
    "the uniqueness allows us to unambiguously define @xmath19 as the angular velocity of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "as the vectors @xmath17 are free , their application point is not fixed and so , according to this traditional definition , @xmath19 is not given an application point .",
    "this fact seems close to intuition .",
    "indeed , let us consider foucault s 1851 famous experiment performed at the paris observatory .",
    "by using a pendulum he was able to prove that the earth rotates with an angular velocity which coincides with that inferred from the observation of distant stars .",
    "of course , the choice of paris was not essential , and the measurement would have returned the same value for the angular velocity were it performed in any other place on earth . in fact , the reason for assigning to the angular velocity an application point in the instantaneous axis of rotation becomes clear only in very special applications , and in particular when the composition of rigid motions is considered .",
    "this fact will be fully justified in section [ njc ] .",
    "here we just wish to illustrate how , using the analogy between forces and angular velocities , it is possible to solve non - trivial problems on the composition of motions .",
    "consider , for instance , four frames @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the absolute frame and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , moves with respect to @xmath20 with an angular velocity @xmath25 .",
    "let us suppose that at the given instant of interest , and for @xmath24 , the instantaneous axes of rotation of @xmath23 as seen from @xmath20 , lie all in the same plane as shown in figure [ fun ] .",
    "we can apply the well known rules of statics , for instance using the funicular polygon @xcite , to obtain the angular velocity @xmath26 and the instantaneous axis of rotation of @xmath27 with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "motion with respect to @xmath22 by using the funicular polygon method .",
    "this method was originally developed for finding the central axis in problems of statics.,width=340 ]    it is also interesting to observe if a frame @xmath28 rotates with angular velocity @xmath19 with respect to @xmath29 , and @xmath29 rotates with angular velocity @xmath30 with respect to @xmath22 , and if the two instantaneous axes of rotation are parallel and separated by an arm of length @xmath31 , then , at the given instant , @xmath28 translates with velocity @xmath32 in a direction perpendicular to the plane determined by the two axes . as a consequence",
    ", any act of translation can be reduced to a composition of acts of pure rotation .",
    "this result is analogous to the usual observation that two opposite forces @xmath0 and @xmath33 with arm @xmath31 generate a constant mechanical momenta of magnitude @xmath34 and direction perpendicular to the plane determined by the two forces . as a consequence",
    ", any applied momenta can be seen as the effect of a couple of forces .",
    "of course , screw theory has other interesting consequences and advantages .",
    "we invite the reader to discover and explore them in the following sections .",
    "the key ideas leading to screw theory included in this article have been taught at a second year undergraduate course of `` rational mechanics '' at the faculty of engineer of florence university ( saved for the last technical section ) .",
    "we shaped this text so as to be used by our students for self study and by any other scholars who might want to introduce screw theory in an undergraduate course .",
    "indeed , we believe that it is time to introduce this beautiful approach to mechanics already at the level of undergraduate university programs .",
    "screw theory is venerable ( for an account of the early history see @xcite ) .",
    "it originated from the works of euler , mozzi and chasles , who discovered that any rigid motion can be obtained as a rotation followed by a translation in the direction of the rotation s axis ( this is the celebrated chasles s theorem which was actually first obtained by giulio mozzi @xcite ) , and by poinsot , chasles and mbius , who noted the analogy between forces and angular velocities for the first time @xcite .",
    "it was developed and reviewed by sir r. ball in his 1870 treatise @xcite , and further developed , especially in connection with its algebraic formulation , by clifford , kotelnikov , zeylinger , study and others .",
    "unfortunately , by the end of the nineteenth century it was essentially forgotten to be then fully rediscovered only in the second half of the twentieth century .",
    "it remains largely unknown and keeps being rediscovered by various authors interested in rigid body mechanics ( including this author ) .",
    "unfortunately , screw theory is usually explained following descriptive definitions rather than short axiomatic lines of reasoning . as a result , the available introductions are somewhat unsatisfactory to the modern mathematical and physical minded reader . perhaps for this reason , some authors among the few that are aware of the existence of screw theory claim that it is too complicated to deserve to be taught .",
    "for instance , the last edition of goldstein s textbook @xcite includes a footnote which , after introducing the full version of chasles theorem ( sect . [ mvj ] ) , which might be regarded as the starting point of screw theory , comments    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ @xmath35 there seems to be little present use for this version of chasles theorem , nor for the elaborate mathematics of screw motions elaborated at the end of the nineteenth century .",

    "furthermore , while elaborate the mathematics of screw theory simplifies the development of mechanics .",
    "admittedly , however , some people could be dissatisfied with available treatments and so its main advantages can be underestimated .",
    "we offer here a shorter introduction which , hopefully , could convince these readers of taking a route into screw theory .",
    "let us comment on some definitions of screw that can be found in the literature , so as to justify our choices .",
    "a first approach , that this author does not find appealing , introduces the screw by means of the concept of _ motor_.",
    "this formalism depends on the point of reduction , and one finds the added difficulty of proving the independence of the various deductions from the chosen reduction point .",
    "it hides the geometrical content of the screw and makes proofs lengthier .",
    "nevertheless , it must be said that the motor approach could be convenient for reducing screw calculations to a matter of algebra ( the so called screw calculus @xcite ) .    in a similar vein ,",
    "some references , including selig s @xcite , introduce the screw from a matrix formulation that tacitly assumes that a choice of reference frame has been made ( thus losing the invariance at sight of the definition ) .",
    "still concerning the screw definition , some literature follows the practical and traditional approach which introduces the screw from its properties ( screw axis , pitch , etc . )",
    "@xcite , like in old fashioned linear algebra where one would have defined a vector from its direction , verse and module , instead of defining it as an element of a vector space ( to complicate matters , some authors define the screw up to a positive constant , in other words they work with a projective space rather that a vector space ) .",
    "this approach could be more intuitive but might also give a false confidence of understanding , and it is less suited for a formal development of the theory .",
    "it is clear that the vector space approach in linear algebra , while less intuitive at first , proves to be much more powerful than any descriptive approach .",
    "of course , one has to complement it with the descriptive point of view in order to help the intuition . in my opinion the same type of strategy should be followed in screw theory , with a maybe more formal introduction , giving a solid basis , aided by examples to help the intuition .",
    "since descriptive intuitive approaches are not lacking in the literature , this work aims at giving a short introduction of more abstract and geometrical type .",
    "it should be said that at places there is an excess of formality in the available presentations of screw theory .",
    "i refer to the tendency of giving separated definitions of screws , one for the kinematical _ twist _ describing the velocity field of the rigid body , and the other for the _ wrench _ describing the forces acting on the body .",
    "this type of approach , requiring definitions for screws and their dual elements ( sometimes called co - screws ) , lengthens the presentation and forces the introduction and use of the dual space of a vector space , a choice which is not so popular especially for undergraduate teaching .    who adopts this point of view argues that it should also be adopted for forces in mechanics , which should be treated as 1-forms instead as vectors .",
    "this suggestion , inspired by the concept of conjugate momenta of lagrangian and hamiltonian theory , sounds more modern , but would be geometrically well founded only if one could develop mechanics without any mention to the scalar product .",
    "the scalar product allows us to identify a vector space with its dual and hence to work only with the former .",
    "if what really matters is the pairing between a vector space and its dual then , as this makes sense even without scalar product , we could dispense of it .",
    "it is easy to realize that in order to develop mechanics we need a vector space ( and/or its dual ) as well as a scalar product and an orientation ( although most physical combinations of interest might be rewritten so as a to get rid of it , e.g.  the kinetic energy is @xmath36 $ ] ) .",
    "analogously , in screw theory , it could seem more appealing to look at kinematical twists as screws and to dynamical wrenches as co - screws , but geometrically this choice does not seem compelling , and in fact it is questionable , given the price to be paid in terms of length and loss of unity of the presentation .",
    "therefore , we are going to use just one mathematical entity - the screw - emphasizing the role of the screw scalar product in identifying screws and dual elements .    in this work",
    "i took care at introducing screw theory in a way as far as coordinate independent as possible , but avoiding the traditional descriptive route . in this approach",
    "the relation with the lie algebra of rigid maps becomes particularly transparent .",
    "finally , most approaches postpone the definition of screw after the examples of systems of applied forces from which the idea of screw can been derived .",
    "i think that it is better to introduce the screw first and then to look at the applications .    in this way , through some key choices , i have obtained a hopefully clear and straightforward introduction to screw theory , which is at the same time mathematically rigorous .",
    "my hope is that after reading these notes , the reader will share the author s opinion that screw theory is indeed `` the right '' way of teaching rigid body mechanics as the tight relation with the lie group of rigid maps suggests .",
    "in this section we define the _ screw _ and prove some fundamental properties .",
    "specific applications will appear in the next sections .",
    "let us denote with @xmath37 the affine euclidean space modeled on the three dimensional vector space @xmath38 .",
    "the space @xmath38 is endowed with a positive definite scalar product @xmath39 , and is given an orientation .",
    "this structure is represented with a triple @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the orientation .",
    "note that thanks to this structure a vector product @xmath42 can be naturally defined on @xmath38 .",
    "points of @xmath37 are denoted with capital letters e.g.  @xmath43 while points in @xmath38 are denoted as @xmath44 we shall repeatedly use the fact that the mixed product @xmath45 changes sign under odd permutations of its terms and remains the same under even permutations .",
    "a vector field is a map @xmath46 .",
    "an _ applied vector _ is an element of @xmath47 , namely a pair @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the _ application point _ of @xmath48 .",
    "a _ sliding vector _ is an equivalence class of applied vectors , where two applied vectors @xmath48 and @xmath50 are equivalent if @xmath51 and for some @xmath52 , @xmath53 , namely they have the same line of action .",
    "we shall preferably use the concept of applied vector even in those cases in which it could be equivalently replaced by that of sliding vector .",
    "the reason is that the concept of sliding vector is superfluous because it is more convenient to regard applied and sliding vectors as special types of screws .",
    "occasionally , we shall use the concept of _ reference frame _ which is defined by a choice of _ origin _",
    "@xmath54 , and of positive oriented orthonormal base @xmath55 for @xmath40 .",
    "once a reference frame has been fixed , any point @xmath56 is univocally determined by its coordinates @xmath57 , defined through the equation @xmath58 .    in order to lighten the formalism",
    "we shall consider different physical vector quantities , such as position , velocity , linear momenta , force , mechanical momenta , as elements of the same vector space @xmath38 .",
    "a more rigorous treatment would introduce a different vector space for each one of these concepts .",
    "the reader might imagine to have fixed the dimension units .",
    "it is understood that , say , a linear momenta can not be summed to a force even though in our treatment they appear to belong to the same vector space .",

    "the screws form a vector space @xmath73 and the map which sends @xmath63 to @xmath64 is linear .    if @xmath74 and @xmath75 are two screws @xmath76 multiplying by @xmath77 the first equation and adding the latter multiplied by @xmath78 we get @xmath79 which implies that the screws form a vector space and that the resultant of the screw @xmath80 is @xmath81 , that is , the map @xmath82 is linear .",
    "given two screws @xmath74 and @xmath75 let us consider the quantity @xmath83    for any two points @xmath61 , @xmath84 .    by definition @xmath85 and @xmath86 , thus @xmath87+{\\bm{s}}_2 \\cdot[{\\bm{s}}_1 \\times ( p - q)]\\}\\\\ & = { \\bm{s}}_1 \\cdot s_2(q)+ { \\bm{s}}_2 \\cdot s_1(q).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to the previous result we can simply write @xmath88 in place of @xmath89 .    the _ screw scalar product _ is the symmetric bilinear map @xmath90 which sends @xmath91 to @xmath88 .",
    "note that the scalar invariant of a screw is one - half the screw scalar product of the screw by itself .",
    "since this scalar invariant can be negative , the screw scalar product on @xmath73 is not positive definite .",

    "screw theory , although venerable , has found some difficulties in affirming itself in the curricula of the physicist and the mechanical engineer .",
    "this has changed in the last decades , when screw theory has finally found application in robotics , where its ability to deal with the composition of rigid motions has proved to be much superior with respect to treatments based on euler coordinates .",
    "we have given here a short introduction to screw theory which can provide a good starting point to a full self study of the subject .",
    "we started from a coordinate independent definition of screw and we went to introduce the concepts of screw axis , screw scalar product and screw commutator .",
    "we introduced the dual space and showed that any frame induces an isomorphism on @xmath114 which might be used to perform calculations .",
    "we then went to consider kinematical and dynamical examples of screws , reformulating the cardinal equations of mechanics in this language .",
    "particularly important was the application of the screw scalar product in the expressions for the kinetic energy and power , in fact the virtual work ( power ) is crucial in the formulation of lagrangian mechanics .",
    "in this connection , we mentioned the importance of reciprocal screws .",
    "finally , we showed that the space of screws is nothing but the lie algebra @xmath342 , and that the screw scalar product is the klein form .",
    "philosophically speaking , screw theory clarifies that the most natural basic dynamical action is not the force , but rather the force aligned with a mechanical momenta ( remark [ nhs ] ) . in teaching",
    "we might illustrate the former action with a pushing finger and the latter action with a kind of pushing hand .",
    "analogously , the basic kinematical action is not given by the act of pure rotation ( or translation ) but by that of rotation aligned with translation .",
    "again , for illustration purposes this type of motion can be represented with that of a ( real ) screw .",
    "clearly , in our introduction we had to omit some arguments .",
    "for instance , we did not present neither the cylindroid nor the calculus of screws . nevertheless , the arguments that we touched were covered in full generality , emphasizing the geometrical foundations of screw theory and its connection with the lie group of rigid maps .",
    "we hope that this work will promote screw theory providing an easily accessible presentation to its key ideas .",
