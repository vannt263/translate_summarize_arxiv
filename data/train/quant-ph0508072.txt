    "in a quantum key exchange ( qke ) protocol there are three parties ; alice and bob who want to exchange a secret key and a malicious third party , eve .",
    "eve has access to unlimited quantum computational power and she can monitor but not alter all public communication between alice and bob .",
    "alice and bob can access a quantum communication channel ( we assume that this channel is lossless ) and an authenticated public channel .    following a certain qke protocol , alice and",
    "bob transmit quantum states over their quantum communication channel and perform measurements on their respective quantum states . from the measurements they extract bit values . by communication over the authenticated public channel ,",
    "alice and bob agree which bits will be used for secret key generation .",
    "they estimate the bit error rate @xmath0 of these key bits with another round of public communication .",
    "alice and bob then apply information reconciliation and privacy amplification to the key bits so that they end with a shared bit string @xmath1 .    in @xcite , a generic security proof is proposed by which the security of a wide class of qke protocols is proved .",
    "it is based on the fact that privacy amplification is equally secure when an adversary s memory for data storage is quantum rather than classical ( @xcite ) .",
    "the generic security proof gives alice and bob a threshold @xmath2 for the bit error rate @xmath0 .",
    "this means that if @xmath3 , then @xmath1 is unconditionally secure .",
    "the generic security proof is applicable to qke protocols that involve quantum systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom ( in @xcite and in @xcite it was proved that bb84 is secure for @xmath4 ) .",
    "it does not immediately apply however to qke protocols using quantum systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "bb84 ( @xcite ) is a qke protocol that works with two - dimensional quantum bits ( qubits ) which are encoded by single photons polarized in one out of two non - orthogonal bases .",
    "the unconditional security of bb84 is based on alice s ability to prepare single photons , something that is still extremely difficult .    in @xcite , a qke protocol , which we denote by gp00 ,",
    "was presented that resembles bb84 but solves the problem of preparing single photons .",
    "gp00 works with infinite - dimensional squeezed states , which can be prepared by a laser .",
    "the squeezing parameter @xmath5 determines the amount of squeezing of a squeezed state .",
    "the more squeezing , the more difficult a squeezed state is to prepare , therefore we need a lower bound for @xmath5 . in @xcite it was proved that the protocol is secure if @xmath6 hence if @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we apply the generic security proof to gp00 and find the same thresholds .",
    "a generic security proof is advantageous because it can give more insight in the security of similar protocols .",
    "further , we will discuss some remaining security issues of gp00 .",
