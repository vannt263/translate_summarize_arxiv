    "leads to co - channel interference ( cci ) , successive interference cancellation ( sic ) is performed at the receivers to remove the undesired interference .",
    "the authors of @xcite investigated the impact of user pairing on the sum rate of noma systems , and it was shown that the system throughput can be increased by pairing users enjoying good channel conditions with users suffering from poor channel conditions . in @xcite , a transmission framework based on signal alignment was proposed for mimo noma systems . a suboptimal joint power allocation and precoding design was presented in @xcite for the maximization of the system throughput in multiuser mimo noma single - carrier systems .",
