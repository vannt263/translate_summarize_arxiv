    "since the earliest days of signal and waveform analysis , engineers have recognized the wide utility of parameterized families of _ filters _ : convolution operators that are directly represented by finite - length sequences of real numbers .",
    "parallel banks of such finite - impulse - response filters , including short - time fourier and wavelet transforms , have long been a canonical tool for analyzing signals , images , and other data sets that arise in a variety of applications across scientific fields@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to further expand filterbank theory and practice by developing a general framework of reverse - order and convolution subband structures in filterbank transforms .",
    "it describes a series of new results outlining equivalences between certain `` rewirings '' of filterbank block diagrams , and the `` localized '' aliasing and modulation properties of sampled signals and their subband representations , which we describe below .",
    "sampled signals are typically acquired as linear functionals of the underlying data object of interest , which in turn is defined with respect to a continuous variable such as time or space .",
    "the actions of the convolution operators that comprise filterbanks are studied through their fourier transforms , under the correspondence of element - wise multiplication on the dual group . since sampling a continuous - time function",
    "periodizes its fourier transform , however , care must be taken that no information is lost in the process .",
    "indeed , in the absence of additional assumptions , it is not in general possible to recover signals that have _ aliased _ ; that is , signals whose fourier transforms are supported on intervals so large that this periodization mixes distinct fourier coefficients .    as the bandwidth of any function is directly determined by its _",
    "smoothness , fourier analysis does not lend itself to a meaningful analysis of signals whose smoothness varies and hence are not low - pass _ everywhere_. in contrast , parallel banks of convolution operators with finite support are fundamentally _ local _ in nature .",
    "it is well known , for instance , that the flexibility afforded by wavelets to adapt to the local regularity of functions is essential in yielding the sparsity properties necessary for effective signal and image analysis , as well as contemporary signal acquisition techniques such as compressed sensing@xcite .",
    "filterbanks are hence essential engineering tools for data analysis .",
    "however , definitions of aliasing and frequency modulation in the global , fourier context preclude the closed - form filterbank analysis of signals subject to missing data , spatially or temporally multiplexed acquisition , or signal - dependent noise effects . while it is well known how to apply filterbanks to analyze , modify , and enhance signals that are free from aliasing or modulatory effects , the literature presently lacks a unified filterbank theory for these settings .    in this work",
    "we develop a set of results necessary to fully understand and exploit the _",
    "local _ aliasing and modulation properties of sampled signals and their subband representations .",
    "though our motivation stems from signal processing problems typically encountered in practice ( such as those mentioned above , to which we return at the end of the article ) , our results are more general , showing equivalences between certain `` rewirings '' of filterbank block diagrams , and the corresponding actions of convolution , modulation , and downsampling operators .",
    "our primary contributions are the introduction and analysis of two cardinal rewiring mechanisms  reverse - order subband structure ( ross ) and subband convolution structure ( scs)by which filterbank subbands are coupled together to describe the relationship between localized aliasing , modulation , and convolution .",
    "the framework we introduce is distinct from work involving signal recovery methods @xcite and sampling theorems @xcite in the extant literature .",
    "such work has successfully characterized sufficient conditions for exact reconstruction when filterbank theory is used to restrict the class of signals under consideration , or to specify the fundamental compressibility of its members .",
    "in contrast , this article employs filterbank theory to describe the data acquisition and sampling process itself , rather than any properties of a given signal class .",
    "notions of localized aliasing and localized modulation are intimately connected with the ross and scs analyses that we introduce below , and are also complementary to other well - understood concepts in filterbank analysis .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the remainder of section i",
    "we introduce key definitions and filterbank notation , and provide a simple example of local aliasing and local modulation that motivates our subsequent analysis . in section [ sec : ross ] we introduce our first `` rewiring '' notion  that of reverse - order subband structure  and derive corresponding expressions for the filterbank coefficients corresponding to a subsampled signal . in section",
    "[ sec : scs ] we build on this work to introduce the notion of subband convolution structure  our second means of filterbank rewiring  and show how it leads to a convolution theorem particularly suited to the local modularity of the filterbank transform .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section [ sec : likelihood ] where we consider the practical use of these two notions in problems involving missing data , multiplexed signal acquisition , and signal - dependent noise .      throughout ,",

    "let @xmath10 denote the discrete - time fourier transform of @xmath2 , with @xmath11 its corresponding normalized angular frequency .",

    "this phenomenon is called _ aliasing _ ; in the absence of additional information , aliased portions of @xmath2 can not be recovered from @xmath16 alone .",
    "the fourier transform is a fundamentally global operation ; modulation and aliasing mix non - local information from the sequence @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , a _ filterbank _ maps a sequence @xmath2 to some alternative representation by way of localized _ filterbank coefficients _ ( `` analysis '' ) , and subsequently yields a linear reconstruction @xmath17 ( `` synthesis '' ) ; well - known examples include short - time fourier and wavelet representations .",
    "as the analysis operator acts linearly , we write its action as an inner product , calling it a filter when it is a convolution operator parameterized by translation along a sublattice of @xmath18 , as is the case considered here .",
    "if this convolution operator is represented by the actions of a finite - length , real - valued sequences in @xmath19 , then we refer to a real - valued , finite - impulse - response analysis filter @xmath20 and corresponding synthesis filter @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig : filterbank00](a ) illustrates a basic filterbank structure , with two analysis filters @xmath22 and two synthesis filters @xmath23 .",

    "typically @xmath33 and @xmath34 are smooth ( i.e. ,  low - pass ) filters , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 have zero average .",
    "thus , @xmath37 provides a measure of local low - frequency energy concentration , while @xmath38 captures local high - frequency energy , with temporal localization provided by the finite support of @xmath39 .",
    "a filterbank s joint time - frequency resolution can be fine - tuned by recursively nesting copies of the basic one - level transform structure illustrated in figure [ fig : filterbank00](a ) , yielding the multi - level filterbank structures that we consider later in section [ sec : multi - level ] .",
    "note that the fourier representation of   implies the superposition of shifted copies of the resultant filtered spectra , which in general will give rise to aliasing of the type illustrated in figure [ fig : sampling](f ) .",
    "it is thus natural to ask for conditions under which this aliasing will cancel  a prerequisite for the exact reconstruction of any input sequence @xmath40 from its filterbank coefficients , such that @xmath41 in the diagram of figure [ fig : filterbank00](a ) . to this end",

    "these properties serve as the foundation for the reverse - order subband filterbank structure that we introduce in section [ sec : ross ] below .",
    "the preceding section has served to introduce the basic notions of filterbank theory that we shall employ here . before continuing , it is instructive to consider a simple motivating example based on the simplest case of the haar filterbank transform .",
    "in essence , we will see that `` rewiring '' filterbank diagrams such as those in figure [ fig : filterbank01 ] can be related to the actions of convolution , modulation , and downsampling operators . in subsequent sections",
    "we develop these properties formally , and show how they yield new insights into important practical problems .    to begin , consider the symmetric hadamard matrix @xmath50 which maps two - dimensional vectors to the corresponding sums and difference of their components , and thus serves to define the ( unnormalized ) one - level haar filterbank .",

    "in fact , we will see in section [ sec : scs ] that our filterbank rewiring techniques recover precisely this notion of group structure , in direct analogy to _ global _ fourier analysis . in section [ sec : likelihood ] , these ideas will reappear in the context of analysis of signals subject to multiplicative noise corruption .",
    "having introduced the necessary definitions and given two brief examples , we now begin our technical development of filterbank `` rewiring . ''",
    "bearing in mind the examples considered above , we introduce in section [ sec : complementary ] below the notion of _ complementary filterbanks _ , and then employ them to obtain the following results in section  [ sec : ross_theorems ] : the _ reverse - ordering of subband structure _ that results from modulation , and _ localized aliasing _ that stems from averaging the low- and high - frequency filterbank coefficients . in section  [ sec : multi - level ] we extend these results to the setting of multi - level filterbanks .      _",

    "while data likelihoods often do not admit straightforward closed - form expressions through traditional filterbank analysis , the ross and scs concepts provide a new way to characterize signals subject to aliasing or signal - dependent noise effects directly in the filterbank coefficient domain , by virtue of the associated filterbank rewiring techniques .",

    "the likelihood expressions of corollaries [ cor : likelihood1 ] and [ cor : likelihood2 ] above extend straightforwardly to the case of separable two - dimensional filterbank transforms , which in turn are typically employed in imaging applications .",
    "thus , to illustrate the practical applicability of these results , we now undertake two proof - of - concept experiments that are representative of problems frequently encountered in digital imaging , and for which our ross and scs characterizations  in contrast to standard approaches  yield closed - form likelihood expressions for the corresponding filterbank coefficients .",
    "the first of these  image interpolation in the presence of noise  is made difficult by the fact that low- and high - frequency filterbank subbands interact with one another as well as with the noise itself ; the `` rewiring '' expression of corollary [ cor : likelihood1 ] in turn provides a closed - form likelihood expression for the filterbank coefficients . in the second experiment , we consider the similarly difficult problem of mitigating _ multiplicative _ noise ; in this case , corollary [ cor : likelihood2 ] yields the corresponding likelihood .",

    "we assume such a prior distribution here , and evaluate posterior means numerically via monte carlo averages .",

    "figure [ fig : ex01](c ) shows the corresponding image reconstruction , which retains much of sharpness of the image edges and textures while suppressing noise , resulting in an snr gain of 3.81  db . for purposes of comparison , figure [ fig : ex01](d ) shows the result of the recently proposed simultaneous interpolation and denoising method of @xcite , which yields an snr gain of 3.55  db ; this reconstruction exhibits edges that are more strongly preserved , but at the expense of greater smoothing of image textures .    in our second experiment , we consider a synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) image , available at www.sandia.gov/radar ;",
