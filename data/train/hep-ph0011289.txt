    "prompt - photon production at high transverse momentum  @xcite , @xmath4 , has been a classic tool for constraining the nucleon s gluon density , because at leading order a photon can be produced in the compton reaction @xmath5 .",
    "the `` point - like '' coupling of the photon to the quark provides a potentially clean electromagnetic probe of qcd hard scattering .",
    "a pattern of disagreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data for prompt photon production has been observed in recent years  @xcite , however , not globally curable by changing the factorization and renormalization scales in the calculation , or by `` fine - tuning '' the gluon density  @xcite .",
    "the most serious problems relate to fixed - target data , where next - to - leading order ( nlo ) theory dramatically underpredicts some data sets  @xcite . at collider energies",
    "@xcite , there is less reason for concern , but also here the agreement is not fully satisfactory . in this context , threshold resummations for the inclusive prompt photon cross section have been developed in  @xcite and applied phenomenologically in  @xcite . at partonic threshold when the initial partons have just enough energy to produce the high-@xmath6 photon and a massless recoiling jet , the phase space available for gluon bremsstrahlung vanishes , resulting in logarithmic corrections to the partonic cross section .",
    "threshold resummation  @xcite organizes these corrections to all orders in @xmath7 .",
    "phenomenological studies  @xcite of threshold resummation for the prompt photon cross section have shown that the size of the resummation effects increases with @xmath8 , where @xmath6 is the photon transverse momentum .",
    "this is expected  @xcite from the interplay of the resummed partonic cross section with steeply falling parton distributions , and explains why resummation effects are small for the prompt photon cross section measured at the tevatron  @xcite , where @xmath9 is generally smaller than 0.1 .",
    "in contrast to this , for fixed - target energies , where values as large as @xmath10 are attained  @xcite , a significant enhancement of the theory prediction was found .",
    "the enhancements found in  @xcite , however , are not sufficient to bring theory in line with all fixed - target data ( or , of course , to reconcile conflicting data sets ) .",
    "nonetheless , valuable insights have been gained from applying threshold resummation to the prompt photon cross section .",
    "one of them is that after resummation the theory predictions show a significant improvement in factorization and renormalization scale dependence  @xcite over nlo , which has a notoriously large scale sensitivity .",
    "this implies that threshold resummation does provide an important addition to the theory result , and has helped develop approaches  @xcite that extend threshold resummation , by redistributing its contributions to the hard scattering function over soft gluon _ transverse _",
    "momenta , giving rise to further enhancement of the cross section through recoil effects on the prompt photon spectrum .",
    "we believe that further analyzing the effects of pure threshold resummation is useful , for two reasons .",
    "first , as mentioned above , threshold resummation for the prompt photon cross section has been carried out by two groups  @xcite .",
    "even though both results have been applied numerically  @xcite , a full comparison of the two formalisms has yet to be carried out , either numerically , or at an analytical level .",
    "indeed , it should be mentioned that there are genuine differences between the two formalisms : @xcite resums at fixed , and arbitrary , photon rapidity , while  @xcite applies to the cross section fully integrated over rapidity .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare the two approaches in cases where they both can be applied , which will show the close relation between the two .    providing phenomenological results for the full content of the resummation formula of  @xcite is our other objective in this paper . in the numerical study of the inclusive cross section in  @xcite , the full resummed expression of  @xcite , which is at next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy , was used , although rapidity acceptance was implemented indirectly , by adopting the angular dependence of nlo .",
    "in contrast , the analysis of  @xcite , which made use of the formalism of  @xcite , employed an expansion in the strong coupling truncated at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . it is therefore interesting to study the role of higher - order terms , which do seem to have a fairly significant influence on the final result . to see how",
    ", we must develop a new practical technique for treating rapidity dependence in the resummed cross section , to which we will turn first in sec .",
    "this is an essential extension of the threshold resummation formalism , applicable to any resummed cross section at measured rapidity .",
    "again , to make direct contact with the numerical studies of  @xcite , we adopt the minimal prescription for moment inversion of  @xcite .    in sec .  3",
    ", we give explicit expressions for the resummation exponents at nll accuracy , arising from the formalism of  @xcite .",
    "section  4 presents the nlo hard - scattering functions that multiply the resummed exponents and collect contributions that are constant near threshold .",
    "the actual comparison between the two resummation formalisms of  @xcite and  @xcite is performed at an analytic level in sec .",
    "section  6 discusses our treatment of the inverse mellin and fourier transforms required to obtain the physical cross section from the resummation formalism laid out in sec .",
    "2 . finally , in sec .  7 we present numerical results for both resummation formalisms and provide phenomenological predictions for the prompt photon cross section resummed at fixed rapidity .",
    "the cross section @xmath11 for the single - inclusive production of a photon with transverse momentum @xmath6 and pseudorapidity @xmath12 is given in terms of the partonic cross section @xmath13 and the distribution functions @xmath14 for initial parton types @xmath15 as [ crosec ] = _ a , b _",

    "were we interested simply in the cross section @xmath22 , integrated over all rapidities , an appropriate variable for taking moments would be @xmath23 , as shown in ref .  @xcite . if we wish to retain the rapidity dependence of the single - inclusive photon cross section @xmath24 , we need to introduce a double transform of the cross section .",
    "it turns out to be particularly convenient to do this by defining @xmath25 in this expression , we take mellin moments in @xmath23 and a fourier transform in rapidity .",

    ", the fragmentation contribution to the cross section is generally at the level of only @xmath137 anyway  @xcite , so the uncertainty residing here is not really crucial .    as in  @xcite",
    ", we will focus our calculations on the fixed - target region , where the observed disagreement of data and nlo theory calculations is largest , and which also is known  @xcite to be generally more susceptible to threshold resummation effects than the collider regime , where the relevant values of @xmath9 are much smaller .",
    "figure  [ figpt ] compares our results for the @xmath6 dependence of the resummed prompt photon cross section with those of  @xcite .",
    "we use the same parton distribution functions  @xcite and rescaled fragmentation contribution for both curves .",
    "we show @xmath138 , calculated for p - n collisions at @xmath139 gev , corresponding to the fermilab e706 fixed - target experiment  @xcite , whose data are also displayed . we have chosen the scales @xmath140 and integrated over the rapidity range @xmath141 accessed in the e706 experiment  @xcite . for better visibility",
    ", we have normalized all cross sections by the nlo one .",
    "one notices first of all that threshold resummation induces large effects at high @xmath6 , where it leads to a sizeable enhancement of the theory prediction  @xcite , but is unimportant at the low-@xmath6 end .",
    "figure  [ figpt ] also shows that there are only small differences between the results given by the two resummation formalisms .",
    "these have two origins : first , they are related to the neglect of the rapidity dependence in the resummation exponent and in the higher - order terms of the @xmath21-independent coefficients @xmath54 in  @xcite . as mentioned above , these differences would even be there , had we integrated over _ all _ kinematically allowed @xmath12 , that is , over @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "second , since rapidity dependence in resummation was not available in  @xcite , the means to compare to experimental data covering only a limited range of rapidity was to apply the following acceptance correction to the resummed cross section : [ accept ] ^(res)(|| 0.75 ) ^(res)(all   ) .",
    "that is , it was assumed that rescaling the @xmath12-integrated resummed cross section by an appropriate ratio of nlo cross sections correctly reproduces its rapidity dependence .",
    "this assumption of similarity of the resummed and nlo @xmath12-shapes is actually a fairly good approximation , as we will see below .",
    "we conclude from fig .",
    "[ figpt ] that retaining the rapidity dependence in resummation induces very mild overall corrections for a cross section that is integrated over a substantial region including @xmath143 . as is evident from figure  [ figpt ] , threshold resummation effects , albeit sizable in certain kinematic regions , are not sufficient to obtain a satisfactory description of the e706 data .",
    "this conclusion was first drawn in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the rapidity dependence of the threshold - resummed cross section , where using the full formalism of  @xcite presented above is mandatory .",
    "the ua6 collaboration has presented data for the prompt photon cross section as a function of @xmath12 , taken in pp and @xmath144p fixed - target scattering at @xmath145 gev  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum of the photon was averaged over @xmath146 gev . in fig .",
    "[ figpt2 ] we compare our calculations to these data . in both plots ,",
    "the dashed lines display the fixed - order nlo cross sections for three different choices of the renormalization and factorizations scales , @xmath147 , from lower to upper .",
    "as can be seen , the variation of the nlo predictions induced by scale changes is very large , indicating the importance of yet higher - order effects .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figpt2 ] show the results after adding in the effects of nll threshold resummation .",
    "the most striking feature is a strong reduction of scale dependence .",
    "this effect was also found for the @xmath12-integrated cross section in  @xcite ; our results demonstrate that it occurs over the whole @xmath12 range .",
    "a closer analysis reveals that the main reduction in scale dependence is associated with the factorization scale .",
    "the reasons for this were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "also , the scale dependence decreases even further if we push our calculation to larger @xmath9 .",
    "both these observations are corroborated by fig .",
    "[ fig_530 ] , where we return to the conditions of the e706 experiment  @xcite , looking at the rapidity dependence of the cross section at a fixed , high , photon transverse momentum @xmath148 gev .",
    "the dashed lines again show the nlo cross section for three choices of scales , @xmath147 , and the solid lines display their resummed counterparts .",
    "clearly , the reduction in scale dependence after resummation is dramatic here .",
    "the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_530 ] refer to the nlo cross section for fixed renormalization scale @xmath149 , but varying the factorization scale in the range used previously .",
    "the scale dependence of the nlo cross section thus mainly is due to that on @xmath19 , and the improvement in @xmath19 dependence after resummation , shown by the dot - dashed lines , is striking .",
    "we note that resummation of the @xmath12-dependence of the cross section was also considered in  @xcite . there",
    "the resummed expression was expanded to @xmath150 , thus testing the effects of the nnlo terms generated by resummation .",
    "the numerical results of  @xcite indeed also show some reduction in scale dependence which , however , is not as substantial as the one we find .",
    "this implies that resummation effects beyond nnlo are still important , and that the full resummed series should be taken into account .",
    "our examples in figs .",
    "[ figpt2 ] , [ fig_530 ] also show that threshold resummation mainly affects the normalization of the cross section , and less so its shape in @xmath12 for moderate @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , as we now show , large rapidity can , like high @xmath6 , enhance resummation effects .",
    "we have mentioned earlier that threshold resummation for the prompt photon cross section is typically expected to be relevant in the fixed - target regime , but less so for collider energies , where a given @xmath9 implies a much larger value of @xmath6 and hence a much smaller cross section . as a result , the highest-@xmath6 prompt photons seen at the tevatron are at around @xmath151 gev  @xcite , where @xmath152 which is too small for threshold effects to be really important .",
    "however , we can ask what the effects of threshold resummation would be , _ were _ we able to go out in @xmath6 to , say , @xmath153 gev . keeping in mind that the tevatron jet data  @xcite do reach out to @xmath6 s of that size , this question becomes of some relevance , provided threshold resummation effects for the prompt photon cross section have any resemblance to those for the jet cross section .",
    "[ figcdf ] shows a calculation of threshold resummation effects on the cross section for very - high-@xmath6 prompt photons , produced in p@xmath144 collisions at @xmath154 gev .",
    "the results are normalized to the corresponding nlo cross section .",
    "the solid line shows the cross section averaged over @xmath155 , used for the actual cdf prompt photon data  @xcite , whereas the dashed and dotted lines present the result at a fixed near - central ( @xmath156 ) and forward ( @xmath157 ) rapidity , respectively .",
    "it is evident that at such high @xmath6 threshold resummation effects are sizable even at collider energy , and that , at a given @xmath6 , they tend to become more important with increasing @xmath158 , that is , toward the limit of phase space where large momentum fractions in the parton densities are probed . at low @xmath12 ,",
    "effects remain modest even at large @xmath6 , as recently observed directly in an nnlo expansion  @xcite of the resummed jet cross section .",
    "our finding could be indicative of significant effects also for jet production at the tevatron , in particular in the off - central region .",
    "this result is also suggestive of recent data  @xcite which hints at an excess of high-@xmath6 jets that increases with @xmath12 .",
