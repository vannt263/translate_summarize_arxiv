    "phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparency exists in a wide variety of physical systems , such as atomic gases  @xcite , artificial atoms in superconducting quantum circuits  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , optomechanics  @xcite , and three - level meta - atoms in meta - materials  @xcite .",
    "important applications of eit include the slow light experiments  @xcite , quantum memory  @xcite , precision measurements  @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical interpretations of the peit has not been unified  @xcite . among these many explanations ,",
    "two theories , the ats  @xcite and the qdi  @xcite , are often quoted .    according to the ats theory , the strong coupling field causes a large splitting between the doublet structure in the absorption profile and the probe field",

    ", the qdi theory considers that the quantum destructive interference of two or many transition paths results in the atomic transparency  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the ats and the qdi theory has also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "the common conclusion is that the ats ( qdi ) dominates if the coupling field is strong ( weak ) , compared to the decay of the three - level system . a crossover exists in between  @xcite , where both theories do not work well .",
    "therefore , new experiments are demanded in order to unambiguously discern the two theories .    by periodically switching on and off the coupling and/or the probe field",
    ", we may distinguish the two theories in a different manner .",
    "in fact , switching on suddenly the coupling field in a @xmath0-type three - level system shows unusual transient gain features  @xcite . moreover , modulated two - level systems often exhibit quite different dynamics , compared with the free evolution  @xcite .",
    "for example , the decoherence of a two - level qubit is strongly suppressed by periodically rotating the qubit  @xcite .",
    "we thus expect different dynamics of the three - level system by modulating the coupling and/or the probe field .",
    "a key feature of the modulation in the three - level system is that the ats disappears if the coupling field is off , as shown in fig .",

    "we investigate the absorption of a @xmath0-type three - level system  @xcite driven by periodically modulated coupling and probe fields . by comparing the analytical and numerical results with the ats and qdi s predictions , we expect to distinguish these two theories in the modulated eit experiments .",
