    ", 1975 ) .",
    "between 13 and 19 april , 1975 , as the nova brightens , the spectra show some evidence of steepening .",
    "the best fit of the experimental data between roughly 27 and 28 april was compatible with 8 kev black - body curve ( coe et al . , 1975 ) .",
    "the x - ray source decayed from the outburst with an _ e_-folding time of 19 days in the energy range 3 - 6 kev ( kaluzienski et al . , 1975 ) .",
    "the be star hde 245770 was discovered as the optical counterpart of a 0535 + 26 by bartolini et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , and was classified as o9.7iiie star by giangrande et al .",
    "this is a robust classification , still resistant to many attacks .",
    "complete reviews of this system can be found in the papers by giovannelli et al .",

    "( 1996 ) .",
    "briefly , the properties of this systems , placed at distance of @xmath9 kpc ( giangrande et al . , 1980 ) , can be summarized as follows : hard x - ray transient , long period x - ray pulsar  the secondary star  orbiting around the primary o9.7iiie star .",
    "the masses are of @xmath10 m@xmath11 ( joss & rappaport 1984 ; thorsett et al .",
    "1993 ; van kerkwijk , van paradijs , j. & zuiderwijk , 1995 ) , and 15 m@xmath11 ( giangrande et al . , 1980 ) for the secondary and primary stars , respectively .",
    "the eccentricity is e = 0.497 ( finger et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "usually the primary star does not fill its roche lobe ( de loore et al .",
    ", 1984 ) .",
    "the trigger for writing this paper has been the results reported in the paper by giovannelli & sabau - graziati ( 2011 ) where they emphasize the discovery of low - energy indicators of high - energy processes .",
    "these indicators are ubvri magnitudes and balmer lines of the optical companion .",
    "particular unusual activity of the primary star  usually at the periastron passage of the neutron star  indicates that an x - ray flare is drawing near .",
    "the shape and intensity of x - ray outbursts are dependent on the strength of the activity of the primary .    by using two measurements in optical during two identical decays from relative maxima of the luminosity of hde 245770 , bartolini et al .",
    "( 1983 ) determined the orbital period of the system hde 245770/a 0535 + 26 as p@xmath12 days .",
    "they assumed the time of the maximum flare luminosity observed by rssiger ( 1978 ) as reference maximum , according with jd(l@xmath13 +",
    "n @xmath14 110.856 .",
    "thus , bartolini et al .",
    "( 1983 ) obtained for the maximum of the optical flare of december 5 , 1981 ( jd 2,444,944.5 ) ( giovannelli et al . , 1985 )",
    "( here after 811205-e ; e stands for the event ) the computed time jd 2,444,937.5 not in contrast with the observed time . for",
    "this reason bartolini et al .",
    "( 1983 ) gave jd @xmath15 as time of the occurrence of the 811205-e .",
    "but , since the 811205-e is clearly peaked at that date and triggered the subsequent short x - ray outburst of december 13 , 1981 ( 811213-e ) ( nagase et al . , 1982 ) , giovannelli & sabau - graziati ( 2011 ) assumed the ephemeris of the system as jd@xmath0 = jd@xmath1(2,444,944 ) @xmath2 n(110.856 @xmath2 0.002 ) days .",
    "thus they concluded that the passage of the neutron star at the periastron occurs with a periodicity of 110.856 @xmath2 0.002 days and the various kinds of x - ray outbursts of a0535 + 26  following the definitions reported in the review by gsg92  occur just after @xmath16 8 days .",
    "the intensity of x - ray outbursts range from @xmath17 crab depending on the state of the primary companion o9.7 iiie star : i ) ` normal outbursts ' ( @xmath18 ) crab when the o9.7 iiie star is ` quiescent ' ( steady stellar wind ) ; ii ) anomalous or noisy outbursts ( @xmath19 crab ) when the o9.7iiie star is in a ` turbulent ' state ; some puffs of material , superimposed to the steady stellar wind , are expelled ; iii ) ` casual or giant outbursts ' ( @xmath20 crab ) when the o9.7iiie star is ` very active ' ( i.e. expelling a shell ) . at the periastron the optical luminosity increases from @xmath21 to @xmath22 mag from case i ) to iii ) .",
    "the time delay between optical and x - ray outbursts , starting from 811205-e is becoming longer for the most recent outbursts .",
    "this suggests that the orbital period determined by bartolini et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and used by giovannelli & sabau - graziati ( 2011 ) is slightly too short .",
    "thus , in this paper we assume the orbital period determined by priedhorsky & terrell ( 1983 ) by using x - ray data : p@xmath3 days , and the ephemeris jd@xmath0 = jd@xmath1(2,444,944 ) @xmath2 n(111.0 @xmath2 0.4 ) days .",
    "the 111-day orbital period is completely in agreement with the many determinations reported in the literature ( from optical data , e.g. guarnieri et al . , 1985 ; de martino et al . , 1985 ; hutchings , 1984",
    "; janot - pacheco , motch & mouchet , 1987 . from x - ray data ,",

    ", 1991 ; finger et al . , 1996 ; coe et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper the orbital period of the system is not so crucial .",
    "moreover , the suggestion of the possible presence of a temporary accretion disk around the x - ray pulsar when approaches the periastron ( giovannelli & zikowski , 1990 ) , that was confirmed by x - ray measurements of finger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and deeply discussed by giovannelli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) when the presence of a temporary accretion disk was detected by means of doubling in the he i emission lines , gave us a hint for trying to quantitatively describe the origin of the 8 days time delay between the optical and x - ray outburst in a 0535 + 26/hde 245770 ( flavia star ) system .",
    "in the following section the reader will find a panorama of experimental results enough complete coming from optical and x - ray measurements of the x - ray / be system a 0535 + 26/hde 245770 . only sometimes x - ray and optical measurements were taken in the same epoch , sometimes only optical data were obtained and other times only x - ray data were available .",
    "thus , the reader would pay attention in looking at the various experimental situations , but all having the common denominator : the epoch of the periastron passage of the neutron star around the be star is always before x - ray outbursts of @xmath23 days . if optical data are available , at the periastron passage the optical luminosity shows a relative maximum or the beginning of a decay from it . if x - ray data are available , the x - ray outburst follows the periastron passage of @xmath23 days .",
    "if both optical and x - ray data are available , optical and x - ray outbursts are separated by @xmath23 days .",
    "in the following we will present several experimental facts that clearly demonstrate the delay between the relative enhancement of the optical luminosity of hde 245770 , occurring at the periastron passage , and the consequent x - ray outburst of the x - ray pulsar a0535 + 26 . we can divide the experimental facts in three sets : ( i ) optical and x - ray data are available around the periastron passage ; ( ii ) optical data are available without x - ray data around the periastron passage ; ( iii ) x - ray data are available , but no optical data are available around the periastron passage . in all the three cases",
    "we have plotted a line in correspondence with the periastron passage . in all the cases ,",

    "this bear witness that flavia star was in a ` quiescent ' state ( normal x - ray outburst ",
    "gsg92 : figs . 1 ) .",
    "the same for the normal x - ray outbursts reported in figs . 2 , 3 , and 8 .",
    "on the contrary , when flavia star is ` excited ' , or ` expelling a shell ' , its luminosity increases much more and the following anomalous x - ray outbursts ( gsg92 ) ( figs . 4 , 5 , 9 , 11a and 11c ) or casual x - ray outburst ( ( gsg92 ) ( figs . 6 , 11b , and 12 )",

    "the exception is the double peaked x -ray outburst of fig .",
    "11d for which it is reasonable to think that it occurred casually because of a particular excited state of the optical companion .",

    "may be written ( eggleton , 1983 )    @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mass ratio    @xmath54",
    "suppose that in the vicinity of the periastron the mass flux @xmath55 rapidly increases , reaching @xmath56/year .",
    "we consider here @xmath57 as a mass flux trough the accretion disk , entering the neutron star .",
    "this mass flux during the flare is much greater than the possible flux during the quiescent phase , being the accretion disk probably temporary ( giovannelli et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "therefore we neglect this hypothetical small flux in further considerations .",
    "the outer parts of the accretion disk become hotter , giving increase to the optical luminosity ( optical flush ) . due to large turbulent viscosity , the wave of the large mass flux is propagating to the central object . when this wave reaches the vicinity of the neutron star the x - ray luminosity increases due to appearance of a hot accretion disk region , and due to rapid increase of the luminosity when the accretion flow is channeled by the magnetic field , and falls onto the magnetic poles ( bisnovatyi - kogan , 2002 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & fridman , 1969 ) .",
    "we identify the time delay @xmath58 between the optical and x - ray flashes , with the time during which the wave of a high mass accretion flux , starting from the outer surface @xmath59 , reaches the central compact star radius @xmath60 .",
    "the speed of this wave is approximately equal to the radial speed @xmath61 of the matter in the accretion disk , corresponding to this high mass flux .",

    "the system of equations describing such disk , in a locally stationary approximation , has a following form ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ; bisnovatyi - kogan , 2002 ) .",
    "the mass conservation equation is    @xmath63    the angular momentum equation is    @xmath64    after integration it reduces to a form    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is a specific angular momentum , and @xmath67 is the ( @xmath68 ) component of the viscosity tension tensor ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ) .",
    "the other components of this tensor are assumed to be negligibly small ; @xmath69 is the kepler angular velocity @xmath70 .",
    "the value of the @xmath71 is determined by the angular momentum at the inner boundary of the accretion disk , with zero derivative of the angular velocity . for the accretion into a black hole it corresponds to the keplerian angular momentum at the last stable orbit , at @xmath72 . for the accretion into a non - magnetized ,",
    "slowly rotating neutron star @xmath60 is close to its radius @xmath73 ( bisnovatyi - kogan , 2002 ) . in the case of a strongly magnetized star , where the alfvn radius @xmath74 a definition of the inner radius and inner angular momentum",
    "are less clear , because the matter flows along the field lines to magnetic poles from the alfvn surface , and the disk model failed . in our problem",
    "the time delay is determined by a slow radial motion in the outer parts of the accretion disk , where @xmath75 and therefore the choice of the value of @xmath76 is not so important . for simplicity",

    "the disk was formed due to strong increase of the mass flux when the neutron star approaches the periastron of the orbit .",

    "the matter flux rate in the inner parts of the disk is small at this stage and the contribution of the whole disk to the x - ray luminosity is small .",

    "15 , that the graphs of the time dependence of the radiation power in x - rays is asymmetrical with respect to the maximum .",
    "the increase of radiation power occurs more rapidly than the decline .",
    "this is because the initial symmetric distribution of matter in the disk during its evolution becomes asymmetrical .",
    "this is consistent with the observed asymmetry in the x - ray light curves of a 0535 + 26 .",
    "similar behavior may be expected in other high - mass transient systems with highly eccentric orbits .",
    "the time delay between optical luminosity enhancement  occurring at the periastron  and x - ray flashes with asymmetric light curves is expected to be similar to that measured in a0535 + 26/hde245770 .",
    "note that , according to our model , during the falling flow onto the accreting star , the increase of the luminosity should always start from the low energy part of the spectra , and the maximum in the high energy band follows that in the low energy .",
    "this fact can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "8 where the maximum of the x - ray outburst in the range 210 kev ( sas iii measures ) is reached @xmath23 days before the maximum in the range 2840 kev ( prognoz 6 satellite  signe ii experiment measures ) .",
    "this is contrary to that occurring during the ejection of the hot gas from a star or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , where the increasing of luminosity starts from the high energy side , and the maximum in the low energy part happens after .",

    "this passage is roughly 8 days before any kind of x - ray outbursts , but that of june  august 2010 .",
    "it appears evident that also the very strong x - ray outbursts , named casual outbursts by gsg92 , follow the periastron passage of about 8 days .",
    "indeed , even in the case when a shell is ready to be expelled from the o9.7 iiie star , the event is triggered at the periastron , because of gravitational corkscrew rule .",
    "a huge amount of matter is going onto the temporary accretion disk around the neutron star , producing an enhancement in the optical luminosity .",
    "this matter slowly flows onto the neutron star producing the 8-day - delayed strong x - ray outburst .",
    "this evidence is astonishingly confirmed looking at the light curve of a0535 + 26 ( rosenberg et al . , 1975 ) , when the x - ray source was detected by the ariel v satellite : the detection of the outburst started on april 13 , 1975 ( the first ariel v measure ) , and the periastron passage  accordingly with our ephemeris  occurred on march 30 , 1975 ( jd 2,442,502 ) , @xmath36 days before the beginning of the x - ray outburst , exactly 22 orbital periods before 811205-e ( see fig .",
    "we have constructed a quantitative model of this event , basing on a nonstationary accretion disk behavior , connected with a high ellipticity of the orbital motion .",
    "the observed time delay is related to the motion of a high - mass flux region from the outer boundary of the ns roche lobe to the alfvn surface due to the action of the @xmath95viscosity . for bright outbursts",
