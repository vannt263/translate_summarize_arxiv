    "for a wide variety of substrates , adsorbed films of @xmath0he thicker than approximately two atomic layers are superfluid at zero temperature . as the temperature",
    "is increased , a transition occurs to a non - superfluid phase at a critical temperature @xmath1 . although the details of this transition depend on the topology of the substrate,@xcite the phase diagrams for films adsorbed on substrates such as mylar , porous glasses , or packed powders are similar . in each case",
    ", there is a line of transition temperatures in the density  temperature plane separating non - superfluid from superfluid films . at @xmath2 ,",
    "this line terminates at a _",

    "@xmath3 , below which superfluidity does not occur . only cesium substrates , which are not wetted by @xmath0he,@xcite and the atomically ordered substrates graphite and molecular h@xmath4,@xcite lead to exceptions to this general picture .",
    "although the existence of a non - zero critical coverage @xmath3 has been known since the earliest experiments on unsaturated @xmath0he films , the onset of superfluidity as a function of coverage at @xmath2 has received much less experimental attention than the superfluid transition at @xmath5 .",
    "this has followed in part from the difficulty in making thermodynamic measurements on extremely thin @xmath0he films , but also from a conviction that the non - superfluid film of coverage @xmath3 forms an essentially inert pseudo - substrate for the overlying superfluid film .",
    "most aspects of thin - film superfluidity can indeed be understood without any consideration of the critical coverage @xmath3 , and the @xmath0he coverage is often renormalized by taking the effective density of the film to be @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the superfluid density of films with transition temperatures above 200  mk is observed to be proportional to @xmath6 for many substrates.@xcite    in contrast to the inert - layer model used for the interpretation of most experiments , there has been considerable theoretical work suggesting that the onset of superfluidity at @xmath2 in @xmath0he films is analagous to a metal - insulator transition in fermi systems .",
    "this approach follows from a suggestion of hertz , fleishman , and anderson@xcite and has been pursued in depth by fisher _",
    "et al._,@xcite who exploited the existence of a natural order parameter in bose systems to develop a scaling theory for the onset of superfluidity in strongly disordered systems .",
    "the spirit of this approach is that the onset transition is driven by the competition between exchange , which favors superfluidity , and the _ combined _ effects of disorder and the repulsive he  he interactions , which favor localization .",
    "the localized phase in the case of a @xmath0he film adsorbed on a strongly disordered substrate is presumed to be a `` bose glass , '' with a gapless excitation spectrum and a correspondingly nonzero compressibility .",
    "this paper presents superfluid density measurements of @xmath0he films adsorbed in aerogel glass and heat capacity measurements of @xmath0he films adsorbed in vycor for coverages close to the critical coverage @xmath3 and temperatures down to 10  mk .",
    "our measurements demonstrate that the picture of a superfluid - insulator transition developed by fisher _",
    "et al . _ and others@xcite is qualitatively appropriate .",
    "the heat capacity measurements , for example , indicate that a non - superfluid film is far from inert .",
    "in fact , the density of states of the non - superfluid film has a characteristic energy which vanishes as the onset transition is approached from _",
    "below _ in coverage . we do not , however , find good quantitative agreement with the scaling predictions of fisher _ et al .",
    "_ for the temperature dependence of the heat capacity and the coverage dependence of the superfluid density and the superfluid transition temperature .",
    "we find that the non - superfluid film is best characterized as an insulator with a gap as opposed to a bose glass .",
    "the scaling behavior of thin superfluid films is complicated by both the large energy scale characteristic of physical adsorption and the existence of the thermodynamic superfluid transition at non - zero temperatures .",
    "the thermodynamic transition appears to be the dominant critical point , at least over the temperature and coverage range of our study .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : generic ] we show a generic phase diagram for an unsaturated @xmath0he - film in the temperature - density plane . the film is superfluid at @xmath2 if the coverage exceeds a critical coverage @xmath3 , which is typically 1.5 to 2 atomic layers .",
    "( all of the substrates discussed in this paper are disordered and do not support layer - by - layer growth .",
    "an `` atomic layer '' thus corresponds to an average coverage of one layer . ) a phase boundary , corresponding to the superfluid transition temperature @xmath7 , extends upward from the point ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "the film is non - superfluid above this line .",
    "the phase diagram of fig .",
    "1 is representative of the aerogel and vycor systems discussed in this paper as well as a variety of other disordered substrates .",
    "this paper is devoted to three questions regarding this general phase diagram .",
    "first , how can we better understand the onset transition at @xmath10 : does it have scaling properties like conventional second - order phase transitions ?",
    "second , what is the most appropriate description of non - superfluid films ?",
    "finally , what is our understanding of the thinnest superfluid films , within a few percent of the critical coverage @xmath3 ?",
    "one view of the onset transition is that the @xmath0he film is solid at densities below @xmath3 and thus can not support superfluidity .",
    "this viewpoint is equivalent to drawing a vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic ] at @xmath10 and therefore makes a distinction between the `` solid '' part of the film and the `` liquid '' overlayer , which is superfluid at low temperature .",
    "although this approach , often called the `` inert - layer model , '' is sufficient for interpreting most superflow measurements,@xcite it eschews particle statistics by ignoring exchange between the solid layer and the overlying superfluid film . in its most orthodox form",
    ", the inert - layer model predicts that the various thermodynamic properties of the superfluid should be extensive with respect to @xmath6 , where @xmath11 is the total density of the film . in practice , this does not appear to be the case .",
    "for example , the superfluid density @xmath12 is generally not linear in @xmath6 for coverages very close to the onset of superfluidity .",
    "this observation has to led to some variations on the inert - layer model , including the suggestion that the compression of the film as it becomes thicker leads to an increase in the density of the inert layer.@xcite    a more rigorous approach is difficult , and , although outlined almost twenty years ago,@xcite has been pursued in detail only in the last several years .",
    "it is quite natural to draw an analogy between the metal - insulator transition in fermi systems and the onset transition in a @xmath0he film , which is a bose system . in both cases",
    ", one can argue that the onset of metallic ( or superfluid ) behavior corresponds to the appearance of extended states spanning the system above a critical density @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical machinery developed for fermi systems is not readily adaptable to the bose case because of the strong repulsive interactions .",
    "there is no meaningful non - interacting limit , such as pure anderson localization , for a disordered bose system .",
    "it is possible , however , to consider a pure but strongly interacting system and then gradually turn on the disorder .",
    "the simplest representation of the interactions is a hard - core repulsion @xmath13 that prevents two atoms from occupying the same site .",
    "the effects of quantum exchange are introduced via a hopping matrix element @xmath14 between different sites .",
    "this _ bose - hubbard model _ has been studied for one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice systems.@xcite in both cases , the system is `` superfluid '' ( meaning a many - body extended state exists ) for any density as long as the exchange energy @xmath14 is greater than a critical value @xmath15 . for weak but non - zero exchange",
    ", the system will be superfluid as long as there are sites free to accomodate hopping .",
    "this condition fails only at commensurate densities , at which exactly @xmath11 atoms occupy each site . in this case , the system is localized by the on - site repulsion and is entirely analogous to a mott insulator in the fermionic case .",
    "a gap for particle - hole excitations exists , corresponding to the energy needed to overcome the on - site repulsion when the next atom is added to the system .",
    "disorder , which can be thought of in the simplest case as a random fluctuation in the on - site repulsion @xmath13,@xcite has two effects .",
    "first , it leads to localization at _ incommensurate _ densities since atoms will prefer to occupy sites with the lowest on - site repulsion .",
    "this can be expected to destroy superfluidity in the case of sufficiently weak exchange .",
    "in addition , however , the disorder destroys the mott insulator at commensurate densities , since the distribution in @xmath13 implies that the penalty for double occupancy will be reduced at some sites , thus softening the gap .",
    "as the strength of disorder is increased further , the gap closes even for small exchange , and the mott insulator disappears completely .",
    "although the system is now gapless , it is still localized ( by disorder ) for small exchange strengths .",
    "this gapless bose insulator is often called a _",
    "bose glass_.@xcite      in the case of porous glasses , the adsorption potential is strongly disordered on the energy scale ( @xmath16  k ) characteristic of the exchange in a superfluid @xmath0he film . in this case , the onset of superfluidity within the framework of the bose - hubbard model is most likely to occur from the bose glass phase . a characteristic phase diagram in the plane of exchange strength @xmath14 and chemical potential @xmath17 for the case of strong disorder is shown in fig .",

    "the smaller peak , which seems to coincide with the superfluid transition , may be due to a cascade of resonances .",
    "we do not know why the resonance associated with the large peak is so prominent , since a simple calculation shows that it does not correspond to a low - order third sound resonance .",
    "for the thinnest films , the resonance could be seen even when @xmath73 was almost obscured by noise and uncertainties in the background subtraction .    for films with transition temperatures above 50  mk , we could also determine @xmath1 by fitting the period shift data near the transition to a power law @xmath81 , where @xmath82.@xcite the @xmath1 determined in this fashion was typically 0.2 - 0.3  mk below the temperature at which @xmath73 was non - zero within the resolution of our measurements . in this sense ,",

    "this suggested that either heat was leaking out of the calorimeter on short time scales , hence leading to an overestimate of the heat capacity , or that the anomalous decay was due to some internal relaxation mechanism , perhaps reflecting a significant heat capacity in poor thermal contact with the rest of the calorimeter .",
    "the former possibility was unlikely since the superconducting heat switch provides its best thermal isolation at the lowest temperatures .",
    "we suspected that the vycor itself might harbor a thermal reservoir and modeled the thermal relaxation inside the cell assuming the existence of a reservoir that was weakly linked to the @xmath0he film.@xcite .",

    "weakly binding alkali metal substrates@xcite may ameliorate this effect . in principle , the use of ordered substrates would allow a test of the clean limit of the various dirty boson models , provided that the adsorption potential is sufficiently weak . such a system might be achieved by pre - plating a clean high - surface area substrate , such as exfoliated basal - plane graphite , with molecular hydrogen .",
    "finally , even on a strong - binding ordered substrate such as graphite , the adsorption potential changes only weakly within each monolayer , so that quantum effects should be more readily observable .",
    "the phase - separated superfluids which exist within the second and third monolayers of @xmath0he on graphite may therefore be reasonable analogs of granular superconductors.@xcite    we thank mary lanzerotti for assistance with the superfluid density measurements .",

    "<S> we have studied @xmath0he films adsorbed in two porous glasses , aerogel and vycor , using high precision torsional oscillator and dc calorimetry techniques . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation focused on the onset of superfluidity at low temperatures as the @xmath0he coverage is increased . </S>",
    "<S> torsional oscillator measurements of the @xmath0he - aerogel system were used to determine the superfluid density of films with transition temperatures as low as 20  mk . </S>",
    "<S> heat capacity measurements of the @xmath0he - vycor system probed the excitation spectrum of both non - superfluid and superfluid films for temperatures down to 10  mk . </S>",
    "<S> both sets of measurements suggest that the critical coverage for the onset of superfluidity corresponds to a mobility edge in the chemical potential , so that the onset transition is the bosonic analog of a superconductor - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> the superfluid density measurements , however , are not in agreement with the scaling theory of an onset transition from a gapless , bose glass phase to a superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity measurements show that the non - superfluid phase is better characterized as an insulator with a gap . </S>"
