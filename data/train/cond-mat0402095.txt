    "mgb@xmath1 was discovered to be superconducting only a couple of years ago @xcite , and despite that many of its characteristics have now been investigated and a consensus exists about its outstanding properties .",
    "first of all , this refers to its high t@xmath0 ( @xmath5 40k ) which is a record - breaking value among the _ s - p _ metals and alloys .",
    "it appears that this material is a rare example of multi - band ( at least two ) electronic structure , which are weakly connected with each other .",
    "these bands lead to very uncommon properties .",
    "for example , t@xmath0 is almost independent of elastic scattering , unlike for other two - band superconductors @xcite .",
    "the maximal upper critical magnetic field can be made much higher than that for a one - band dirty superconductor @xcite .",
    "the properties of mgb@xmath1 have been comprehensively calculated by the modern theoretical methods , which lead to a basic understanding of their behavior in various experiments .",
    "magnesium diboride , like other diborides meb@xmath1 ( me = al , zr , ta , nb , ti , v etc . ) , crystalizes in a hexagonal structure , where honeycomb layers of boron are intercalated with hexagonal layers of magnesium located above and below the centers of boron hexagons ( fig .",
    "[ crystal ] ) .",
    ".,width=226 ]    the bonding between boron atoms is much stronger than that between magnesium , and therefore the disordering in the magnesium layers appears to be much easier than in the boron layers .",
    "this difference in bonding between boron and magnesium atoms hinders the fabrication of mgb@xmath1 single crystals of appreciable size .",
    "the electron band structure of mgb@xmath1 has been calculated using different _ ab initio _ methods yielding basically the same result @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 curves are shown in fig.[eldisp ] .     with the b @xmath7-character .",
    "the radii of the hollow ( filled ) circles are proportional to the @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) character and zero - line marks the fermi energy . after mazin _",
    "et  al._@xcite.,width=302 ]    the dispersion relations are shown for boron @xmath7-character orbitals , which play a major role in transport and thermodynamic properties .",
    "the radii of the hollow circles are proportional to the @xmath8-band character , which is made from @xmath9 boron orbitals , while those of the filled circles are proportional to the @xmath10-band character , made from @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "the most important is a quasi two - dimensional dispersion relation along the @xmath12a @xmath13 direction with a small fermi energy @xmath50.6 ev , and accordingly , with a moderate fermi velocity .",
    "the corresponding sheets of the fermi energy form the cylindrical surfaces along the @xmath12a direction seen in fig.[choi - d ] below .",
    "the corresponding electron transport is very anisotropic ( @xmath14 @xcite ) with the plasma frequency for the @xmath2 band along the @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) axis being much smaller than that in the @xmath17 @xmath18 direction @xcite .",
    "the hole branch along @xmath12a experiences a huge interaction with the phonon @xmath4 mode for carriers moving along the @xmath17 plane ( see below ) , although its manifestation is screened effectively by the much faster hole mobility in the @xmath19-band @xcite .    in a dirty material , with prevailing disorder in the magnesium planes , the @xmath8-band conductivity is blocked by defects , and the @xmath10 band takes over , implying greater electron phonon interaction ( epi ) than in the clean material .",
    "this constitutes a plausible explanation for the violation of the matthiesen rule , which manifests itself in an increase of the residual resistivity together with an increase of the temperature coefficient at a high temperature @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", the critical temperature @xmath20 does not decrease substantially in dirty materials @xcite , since the superconductivity is induced by epi in the @xmath10-band , whose crystal order is much more robust .",
    "this consideration is very important in understanding the point - contact data , since the disorder at the surface of the native sample depends on the position of the contact spot , and because of the uncontrolled introduction of the further disorder while fabricating the contact .      in a clean material",
    "the layered crystal structure dictates strong anisotropy of the upper critical magnetic fields @xmath21 .",
    "their ratio at low temperatures reaches about 6 while @xmath22 is as low as 23 t @xcite .",
    "if the field aligned is not precisely along the @xmath17 plane , the @xmath23 value is strongly decreased .    on the other hand , for a dirty material the anisotropy is decreased ( to a ratio of about 1.6@xmath242 ) , but both the magnitudes of @xmath25 and @xmath22 are strongly increased .",
    "for strongly disordered sample , it may be as high as 40 t @xcite !",
    "it is interesting that this high value is achieved at low temperature , where the disordered @xmath8 band is fully superconducting .",
    "hence , we may expect that the value of critical magnetic field at low temperatures is the smaller the cleaner is the part of the mgb@xmath1 volume near the contact , provided its @xmath26 .",
    "this observation is important in the classification of contacts with respect to their purity .",
    "the phonon density of states ( pdos ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ phonondos ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the measured pdos at @xmath27k , while the lower ones shows the calculated dos with the partial contribution from boron atoms moving in the @xmath17-plane and out of it .",
    "one can see the peak for boron atoms moving in the @xmath17 plane at @xmath28 mev , which plays a very important role in the electron - phonon interaction , as is shown in fig.[shukla1 ] , measured by inelastic @xmath29-ray scattering @xcite .",
    "this mode gives a weakly dispersion branch between 60 and 70 mev in the @xmath12a direction with @xmath4 symmetry at the @xmath12 point .",
    "the linewidth of this mode is about 20@xmath2428 mev along the @xmath12a direction , while along the @xmath12 m direction it is below the experimental resolution .",
    "the same phonon peak is active in raman scattering @xcite .",
    "it is located at the same energy with the same linewidth .",
    "this points to the very strong epi for this particular lattice vibration mode .",
    "the same result follows from theoretical considerations .     determined experimentally by neutron scattering .",
    "bottom panel : calculated curve ( solid line ) with decomposition on boron atoms vibrating out of @xmath17 plane ( dotted curve ) and parallel to it ( dashed curve ) .",
    "after osborn _ et  al._@xcite.,width=302 ]     and the width of phonon lines determined by inelastic x - ray scattering ( symbols ) together with calculations ( solid lines ) .",
    "after shukla _ et  al._@xcite.,width=302 ]    figure [ choi - d ] shows the distribution of the superconducting energy gap on the fermi surface of mgb@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the maximum gap value is calculated along the @xmath12a direction due to the very strong epi . just in this direction",
    "is located 2d @xmath10 band ( cylinders along the @xmath12a direction ) .",
    "the 3d @xmath8 band has a much smaller epi , and , correspondingly , a smaller energy gap .",
    "the epi parameter @xmath30 can be decomposed between different pieces of the fermi surface .    .",
    "the gap value around 7 mev corresponds to cylinder like sheets of the fs centered at @xmath31 points , while the small gap value around 2 mev corresponds to the tubular fs network . after choi _",
    "et  al._@xcite .",
    ", width=264 ]    it is shown @xcite that the value of @xmath32 on the @xmath10 band amounts to @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , @xmath34 can be decomposed between different phonon modes , and it appears that only the e@xmath35 phonon mode along the @xmath12a direction plays a major role with a partial @xmath36 value of about @xmath37 @xcite , though concentrated in a very restricted phase space .",
    "the commonly accepted mechanism for high @xmath20 in mgb@xmath1 is connected with the strong interaction between charge carriers and phonons in the @xmath4 mode .",
    "this mode is due to antiparallel vibration of atoms in the boron planes .",
    "the key issue is that along the @xmath12a direction the electron band structure is such that the fermi energy of the hole carriers is only 0.5@xmath38ev , which shrinks even more when the borons deviate from the equillibrium positions .",
    "together with the 2d structure of the corresponding sheet of the fermi surface , this leads to a constant density of states at the fermi energy and , correspondingly , to very large epi with partial @xmath39 ( the epi parameter in the @xmath10 band ) of about @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that the small fermi velocity for charge carriers along the @xmath12a direction leads to a large nonadiabatic correction to @xmath20 ( about twice as much compared with the adiabatic migdal - eliashberg treatment ) .",
    "although this interaction is a driving force to high @xmath20 in this compound , it does not lead to crystal structure instability , since it occupies only a small volume in the phase space .",
    "the role of the @xmath8 band is not completely clear . on the one hand ,",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath41 bands are very weakly connected , and for some crude models they can be thought as being completely disconnected .",
    "on the another hand , the energy gap of the @xmath8 band goes to zero at the same @xmath20 as in the bulk , and correspondingly @xmath42 , which is much less than the value predicted by the weak coupling bcs theory .",
    "one can think of the @xmath8 band as having intrinsically much lower @xmath43 k than the bulk @xcite , and at higher temperatures its superconductivity is induced by a proximity effect in * k*-space from @xmath10 band @xcite .",
    "this proximity effect is very peculiar .",
    "on the one hand , this proximity is induced by the interband scattering between the @xmath8 and @xmath10 sheets of the fermi surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the charge carriers connected with the @xmath8 band are mainly located along the magnesium planes , which can be considered as a proximity effect in coordinate space for alternating layers of @xmath44 structure , although on a microscopic scale . moreover , many of the unusual properties of mgb@xmath1 may be modelled by an alternating @xmath44 layer structure , the limiting case to the crystal structure of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "in other words , mgb@xmath1 presents a crossover between two - band superconductivity and a simple proximity effect structure .",
    "we have two kind of samples supplied for us by our colleagues from the far - east .     films .",
    "after kang _ et  al._@xcite.,width=302 ]    the first is a thin film with a thickness of about several hundred of nanometers ( fig.[films ] ) @xcite .",
    "similar films have been investigated by several other groups with different methods .",
    "these films are oriented with their _",
    "c_-axis perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "the residual resistance is about several tens of @xmath45 cm with a residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) @xmath46 .",
    "this means that on average the films have a disorder between crystallites .",
    "it does not exclude the possibility that on some spots the films contain clean enough small single crystals on which we occasionally may fabricate a point contact : see fig . [ films ] .",
    "normally , we make a contact by touching the film surface by noble metal counter electrode ( cu , au , ag ) in the direction perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "thus , nominally the preferential current direction in the point contact is along the _ c _ axis . nevertheless , since the surface of the films contains terraces with small crystallites , point contact to the _ ab _ plane of these crystallites is also possible . sometimes , in order to increase the probability of making the contact along the _ ab _ plane , we broke the substrate with the film and made contact to the side face of the sample .",
    "single crystals .",
    "_ et  al._@xcite.,width=264 ]    the second type of sample is single crystal @xcite which also was measured by other groups @xcite .",
    "crystals are plate - like ( flakes ) and have sub - millimeter size ( see fig.[scrys ] ) .",
    "they were glued by silver epoxy to the sample holder by one of their side faces . the noble metal counter electrode was gently touched in liquid helium by another ( the opposite ) side face of the crystal . in this way",
    "we try to preferentially make a contact along the _ ab _ plane . on average , in the bulk , the single crystals are cleaner than the films , but one should be cautious , since the properties of the crystal surface differ from the properties of the bulk , and fabrication of a point contact may introduce further uncontrolled defects into the contact area .    thus , _ a priori _ one can not define the structure and composition of the contacts obtained .",
    "nevertheless , much of that information can be ascertained by measuring various characteristics of a contact . among those",
    "the most important is the andreev - reflection - non - linearities of the @xmath47 curves in the superconducting energy - gap range .",
    "the magnetic field and temperature dependences of the superconducting non - linearities supply us with additional information . and",
    "finally , much can be extracted from the @xmath47 nonlinearities in the normal states ( the so - called point - contact spectra ) .",
    "the more information we can collect about the electrical conductivity for different conditions of the particular contact , the more detailed and defined picture of it emerges .",
    "it is not an easy task , since a contact has limited lifetime , due to electrical and mechanical shocks .",
    "let us make a rough estimate of the distance scales involved in the problem .",
    "the crystallite size of films is of the order of 100 nm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the contact size @xmath48 in the ballistic regime equals @xmath49 ( the sharvin formula ) . taking @xmath50@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath54 nm both along the @xmath17 and @xmath15 directions for typical resistance of 10 @xmath55 .",
    "if we suppose that a grain is dirty ( with very short mean free path ) , then we apply the maxwell formula @xmath56 with the results for @xmath48 about 0.7 nm and 2.6 nm for @xmath17 and @xmath15 directions , respectively , taking @xmath57 for corresponding directions from the same reference @xcite .",
    "thus , the contact size can be of the order or smaller than the electronic mean free path ( @xmath58 nm and @xmath59 nm , according to @xcite ) , which means that we are working , apparently , in the spectroscopic regime , probing only a single grain .",
    "rowell @xcite , analyzing a large amount of experimental data for the resistivity and its temperature dependence , came to the conclusion that for highly resistive samples only a small part of the effective cross section should be taken into account .",
    "the reason is that the grains in mgb@xmath1 are to great extent disconnected by oxides of magnesium and boron . for point - contact spectroscopy previous analysis",
    "leads us to the conclusion that the contact resistance is frequently measured only for a single grain or for several grains , with their intergrain boundaries facing the contact interface .",
    "this is due to the current spreading on a scale of the order of the contact size @xmath48 near the constriction .",
    "the non - linearities of the @xmath47 characteristic of a metallic contact , when one of the electrodes is in the superconducting state , can be written as @xcite    @xmath60    here @xmath61 is the contact resistance at zero bias in the normal state .",
    "@xmath62 is the backscattering inelastic current which depends on the electron mean free path ( mfp ) @xmath63 . for ballistic contact",
    "this term is equal , in order of magnitude , to    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the inelastic electron mfp , and @xmath48 is the characteristic contact diameter .",
    "if the electron flow through the contact is diffusive ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 being an elastic mfp ) but still spectroscopic , since @xmath68 , then the expression ( [ inelastic ] ) should be multiplied by @xmath69 .",
    "this decreases the characteristic size , for which the inelastic scattering is important , from @xmath48 to @xmath67 ( @xmath70 ) , and for short @xmath67 makes the inelastic current very small .",
    "we notice that the inelastic backscattering current @xmath62 in the superconducting state is approximately equal to the same term in the normal state .",
    "its second derivative turns out to be directly proportional to the epi function @xmath71 @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 describes the strength of the electron interaction with one or another phonon branch , and @xmath74 stands for the phonon density of states . in point - contact ( pc )",
    "spectra the epi spectral function @xmath71 is modified by the transport factor , which strongly increases the backscattering processes contribution .    in the superconducting state the excess current @xmath75([i - v ] ) , which is due to the andreev reflection of electron quasiparticles from the n - s boundary in a n - c - s point contact ( c stands for  constriction  ) , can be written as    @xmath76    where @xmath77 const for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 being the superconducting energy gap ) .    the nonlinear term in the excess current ( [ excess ] )",
    "can be decomposed in its turn in two parts , which depend in different ways on the elastic scattering of electron quasiparticles :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is of the order of @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "notice that the latter behaves very similar to the inelastic backscattering current @xmath62 , namely , it disappears if @xmath84 , while the first term in the right hand side of expression ( [ excess1 ] ) does not depend on @xmath67 in the first approximation .",
    "this enables one to distinguish the elastic term from the inelastic .",
    "finally , all excess current terms disappear when the superconductivity is destroyed , while @xmath62 remains very similar in both the superconducting and normal states .",
    "the expression for the elastic term in the excess current was calculated for _ ballistic _ n - c - s contacts by omelyanchuk , kulik and beloborodko @xcite .",
    "its first derivative equals @xmath85 :    @xmath86    for the _ diffusive _ limit @xmath87 beloborodko and kulik derived the current - voltage characteristic ( see eq.(21 ) in ref.@xcite ) , which for the first derivative at @xmath88 gives @xcite : @xmath89    for the sake of comparison , the similar expression of the nonlinear term in nis tunnel junctions ( i stands for  insulator  ) , due to the self - energy superconducting energy gap effect , has the form @xcite :    @xmath90 } \\label{wolf}\\ ] ]    equations ( [ om - kul - bel ] ) , ( [ bel ] ) , and ( [ wolf ] ) are identical in their structure and take into account the same effect , viz .",
    ", the renormalization of the energy spectrum of a superconductor in the vicinity of characteristic phonon energies .    from the expressions ( [ i - v ] ) , ( [ inelastic ] ) , ( [ excess ] ) , and ( [ excess1 ] ) it becomes clear that only on the relatively _ clean _ spots one can observe the inelastic backscattering current @xmath62 provided that the excess current term @xmath91 is negligible .",
    "the latter can be canceled by suppression of superconductivity either with magnetic field or temperature . on the contrary , in the superconducting state , for _ dirty _ contacts , all the inelastic terms are very small , and",
    "the main nonlinearity is provided by the @xmath92-dependence of the excess current ( [ bel ] ) .",
    "brinkman _ et al .",
    "_ have shown @xcite that in the clean case for an nis mgb@xmath1 junction , the normalized conductance is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the plasma frequency for the @xmath95 band and @xmath96 is the normalized conductivity of the @xmath95 band separately .",

    "ab_-plane and along the _",
    "c_-axis are @xcite @xmath97    hence , even along the _ ab_-plane the contribution of the @xmath10 band is less than that of the @xmath8 band , to say nothing about the direction along the _ c _ axis , where it is negligible small .",
    "the calculation predicts that if the  _ tunneling cone _  is about several degrees from the precise _ ab _ plane , then the two superconducting gaps should be visible in the tunneling characteristics .",
    "in other directions only a single gap , corresponding to the @xmath8 band , is visible .",
    "we will see below that this prediction is fulfilled in a point - contact experiment , as well .",
    "things are even worse when one tries to measure the anisotropic eliashberg function by means of superconducting tunneling .",
    "the single - band numerical inversion program @xcite gives an uncertain result , as was shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "point - contact spectroscopy in the normal state can help in this deadlock situation .",
    "it is known that the inelastic backscattering current is based on the same mechanism as an ordinary homogeneous resistance , provided that the maximum energy of the charge carriers is controlled by an applied voltage .",
    "the electrical conductivity of mgb@xmath1 can be considered as a parallel connection of two channels , corresponding to the @xmath8 and @xmath41 bands @xcite .",
    "the conductivity of the @xmath8 band can be blocked by disorder of the mg - atoms .",
    "this situation is already obtained in experiment , when the temperature coefficient of resistivity increases simultaneously with an increase of the residual resistivity , which leads to violation of matthiessen s rule ( see fig.3 in @xcite ) . in this case",
    "we obtain the direct access to the @xmath10-band conductivity , and the measurements of the pc spectra of the epi for the @xmath2 band is explicitly possible in the normal state .",
    "below we will see that this unique situation happens in single crystals along _",

    "this is comparable with the nonlinearity observed for nonsuperconducting diborides @xcite with a small electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "the reason for the relatively low nonlinearity of the @xmath47 curves and low intensity of the principal e@xmath35 phonon modes in the spectra for the mgb@xmath1 contacts can be the fact that anomalous strong interaction is characteristic for restricted group of phonons with sufficiently small wave vector @xcite , whereas in point - contact spectroscopy the large angle scattering is underlined .",
    "we made an overview of the pcs investigations of @xmath15-axis oriented thin films and single crystals of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "there are two different superconducting gaps in mgb@xmath1 , which are grouped at 2.4 and 7.0 mev . roughly , in half of all point contacts studied for @xmath15-axis oriented films the two gap structure merges together due to strong elastic scattering remaining a single gap at about 3.5 mev .",
    "anomalous temperature and especially magnetic field dependencies of excess current in point - contact junctions reflect the two - band structure of the superconducting order parameter in mgb@xmath1 .",
    "there are two mechanisms of revealing phonon structure in the pc spectra of mgb@xmath1 : i ) through the inelastic backscattering current , like for ordinary point - contact spectroscopy , and ii ) through the energy dependence of the excess current , like in the similar tunneling spectroscopy of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "they can be discriminated by destroying the superconductivity with a magnetic filed and/or temperature , and by varying the electron mean free path .",
    "the prevailing appearance of the @xmath4 boron mode , which mediates the creation of cooper pairs , is seen in the pc spectra only along the @xmath148 direction in accordance with the theory .",
    "the relatively small intensity of this mode in the pc spectra is likely due to their small wave vector and restricted phase volume .",
    "related diborides ( zrb@xmath1 , nbb@xmath1 , and tab@xmath1 ) have @xmath149 spectra proportional to the electron - phonon interaction spectral function like that in common metals and a small epi constant corresponding to their nonsuperconducting state .",
