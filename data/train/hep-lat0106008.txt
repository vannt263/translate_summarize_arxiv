    "for the foreseeable future , the quenched approximation will continue to play an important role in the study of lattice qcd for both practical and theoretical reasons .",
    "the practical reasons are only too obvious , considering the orders - of - magnitude increase in computer resources required for comparable full qcd simulations . but quenched qcd also provides a very instructive counterpoint to the full theory which can yield useful insight into the effect of quark loops in determining hadron structure .",
    "this is particularly true in the light - quark limit , where lattice results can be interpreted theoretically with the aid of an effective field theory corresponding to quenched chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the introduction of quenched chiral perturbation theory by sharpe , bernard , and goltermann established the framework for analyzing the chiral behavior of quenched qcd .",
    "this work focused attention on the particular , anomalous role of the quenched @xmath6 propagator .",
    "the physical @xmath0 is approximately a flavor singlet and gets most of its mass from the axial anomaly via repeated @xmath7 annihilation . in the quenched approximation",
    ", a single annihilation vertex can appear if both sides of the `` hairpin diagram '' are attached to valence quark lines , but repeated annihilation can not take place without the closed quark loops of the unquenched theory . instead of cancelling the goldstone pole in the valence quark ( `` connected '' )",
    "diagram , the single annihilation diagram contributes a term to the @xmath6 propagator which has a _",
    "goldstone pole and an overall sign opposite to that of the valence diagram . unlike full qcd where @xmath6 loops remain infrared finite in the chiral limit , in the quenched theory",
    ", the double goldstone pole of the hairpin term produces additional quenched chiral loop ( qcl ) singularities which alter the chiral behavior of the theory .",
    "this qcl effect was first observed in lattice results as a deviation from linear behavior of the squared pion mass as a function of quark mass @xcite .",
    "recently , the quenched chiral limit was extensively investigated in a high - statistics study at @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the problem of exceptional configurations , which had prevented previous studies from probing the smaller quark mass region of @xmath9 mev , was resolved by the pole - shifting ansatz of the modified quenched approximation ( mqa)@xcite . the qcl effect was observed in both the pseudoscalar mass and decay constants at the level expected from a direct study of the @xmath6 hairpin mass insertion and the topological susceptibility .",
    "this established several independent and quantitatively consistent determinations of the quenched chiral log coefficient parameter @xmath10 ( or , equivalently , of the @xmath0 mass insertion @xmath11 ) .",
    "the spectroscopy of scalar mesons has long been one of the murkier areas of hadron phenomenology .",
    "the well - established scalar mesons are typically at masses of a gev or more , although there have been occasional , fleeting experimental indications of lower mass scalar resonances . in the flavor singlet sector , mixing with glueball states further complicates the intepretation of experimental data .",
    "this is clearly an area where lattice qcd calculations can be expected to play a crucial role in the future .",
    "high - statistics quenched studies will undoubtedly be an important part of this effort .",
    "naively , we might expect that the anomalous chiral behavior induced by the quenched approximation would be of little importance for scalar - meson spectroscopy , since the meson masses involved are all expected to be quite heavy and not particularly sensitive to the details of chiral extrapolation .",
    "however , as we show in this paper , a more careful theoretical analysis combined with a precise numerical study of the scalar , isovector meson propagator at very light quark mass reveals perhaps the most striking quenched chiral loop effect yet observed .",
    "the lower solid curve is the prediction of one - loop chiral perturbation theory for this term .",
    "( see section 2 . )",
    "[ fig : sc_heavylight ]    the chiral loop effect we discuss here is exhibited very clearly by comparing the scalar , isovector propagator for the heaviest and lightest quark masses studied .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig : sc_heavylight ] .",
    "for the heaviest quark mass the propagator is a positive and rapidly falling exponential , as expected from heavy scalar meson intermediate states .",
    "the fit shown is a sum of two exponentials with the excited state @xmath12 mass extracted by comparing local - local , smeared - local , and smeared - smeared correlators .",
    "( see discussion in section 3 . ) by contrast , the scalar propagator for lighter quarks exhibits a qualitatively different behavior .",
    "[ the lower curve in figure [ fig : sc_heavylight ] is the one - loop quenched @xmath13 prediction for the contribution to the scalar propagator of the @xmath0-@xmath1 intermediate state only .",
    "see below and section 2 .",
    "] this unusual behavior has two qualitative features which point clearly to a specific theoretical interpretation : ( 1 ) the additional component becomes much more prominent for the lightest quark masses , and ( 2 ) the sign of this component is negative ( i.e. opposite to that required by positivity of the spectral function ) .",
    "both of these properties suggest that the new component is an effect of the @xmath0-@xmath1 intermediate state , which is light in the quenched approximation .",
    "this contribution arises from the `` hairpin + pion '' diagram shown in figure [ fig : quark_lines](b ) .",
    "this interpretation also explains the fact that this component has a negative spectral weight .",
    "the hairpin ( single mass insertion ) diagram appears in the @xmath0 propagator with the opposite sign from that of the full propagator . in full qcd",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 intermediate state would arise from three different types of quark line diagrams , figure [ fig : quark_lines](a ) with a single vacuum loop going around the entire diagram , figure [ fig : quark_lines](b ) with a single hairpin vertex , and the graphs of type [ fig : quark_lines](c ) with one or more vacuum bubbles inserted into the @xmath6 propagator .",
    "of these three , only the hairpin diagram , figure [ fig : quark_lines](b ) , is included in the quenched approximation . since the single hairpin insertion has an overall negative sign ( corresponding to a positive @xmath0 mass shift ) , the sign of this contribution is opposite to that which would be required by spectral positivity .",
    "the prominence of this negative term in our measured propagator is a clear example of the unitarity violation induced by the quenched approximation .",
    "[ in the bernard - goltermann scalar ghost quark formulation of quenched chiral perturbation theory , the negative sign of the scalar propagator arises from the dominance of a negative metric state consisting of a pair of ghost - quark mesons . ]",
    "in a recent study of quenched chiral logs and the @xmath6 propagator @xcite , the mqa pole - shifting ansatz was applied to a set of quark propagators for an ensemble of 300 gauge configurations at @xmath8 on a @xmath14 lattice .",
    "the fermion action was clover - improved wilson - dirac with @xmath15 .",
    "nine values of quark mass were used , corresponding to a range of hopping parameters from @xmath16 to .1428 .",
    "valence quark propagators were calculated from both local delta - function sources and from exponentially smeared sources in coulomb gauge .",
    "( for further details , see reference @xcite . )",
    "these pole - shifted quark propagators were used to calculate the scalar meson propagators considered in this paper .",
    "the pion masses obtained from this ensemble have values ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , and are listed in table i.    it is natural to expect that the scalar @xmath19 correlator in qcd will be dominated by the coupling to the lightest scalar meson which is expected to have a mass larger than @xmath20 gev . for the heaviest quark masses studied here ,",
    "this is in fact the behavior observed for the quenched propagator .",
    "first , consider the scalar propagator for our heaviest quark mass , with @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "( from reference @xcite , we have @xmath23 for clover - improved wilson - dirac fermions ) .",
    "the measured values of the local - local , smeared - local , and smeared - smeared propagators are shown in the log plot in figure [ fig : sc1400_logplot ] . as expected , the plot shows clear evidence of a massive scalar meson . for the smeared - local propagator ,",
    "the time - dependence is reasonably well described for @xmath24 by an exponential fit with a mass of @xmath25 .",
    "the effective mass plot for the smeared - local propagator is shown in figure [ fig : effective_mass ] for @xmath22 . for comparison , the effective mass for the local - local and smeared - smeared propagators",
    "are also plotted .",
    "although the smearing function used ( an exponential with exponent @xmath26 in lattice units ) was not tuned for this particular problem , it does a good job of removing excited state contamination , giving a reasonably flat effective mass over several time slices from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , and a nearly identical effective mass plot for smeared - local and smeared - smeared propagators ( indicating an absence of excited states in both ) .    as pointed out in the introduction , the behavior of the scalar propagator changes dramatically for the lighter quark mass values .",
    "the results for the scalar propagator for our lightest quark mass values are shown in figure [ fig : bsfits ] , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 corresponding to @xmath31 values ( @xmath32 , and .1423 ) respectively .",
    "here we have plotted the local - local @xmath19 correlators . instead of exhibiting the behavior expected for scalar meson states ,",
    "these propagators are dominated by a significant negative contribution in the range @xmath27 to @xmath33 which increases for lighter quark masses .",
    "we interpret this behavior as a clear signal for the negative metric contribution associated with the @xmath6-@xmath1 intermediate state discussed in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 loop interpretation of the anomalous component of the scalar propagator is made more convincing by noting that the leading chiral behavior of this contribution is entirely determined by current algebra in terms of parameters which have already been measured with this ensemble in our previous study of the pseudoscalar propagator @xcite .",
    "the relevant chiral loop diagram is shown in figure [ fig : bubble ] , with the @xmath34 denoting the @xmath0-hairpin mass insertion @xmath11 , and the @xmath35 s representing @xmath19 operator vertices .",
    "if we ignore form factor effects at these vertices , we can calculate the @xmath0-@xmath1 contribution to the @xmath19 propagator in momentum space .",
    "the propagator @xmath36 is given in terms of the one - loop integral @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the @xmath19 to @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling .",
    "( in the next section we will discuss including the scalar meson intermediate state , along with form - factor / unitarization effects ) .",
    "the pion mass values for the hopping parameters used here have already been reported in reference @xcite and are listed here in table i. the hairpin insertion mass @xmath11 is also determined in reference @xcite . for clover improved fermions with @xmath15 the value found in the chiral limit ( dropping a flavor factor of @xmath41 included in table ii of that reference ) is @xmath42 the quark mass dependence of @xmath43 was found to be very mild ( see table ii of reference @xcite ) . here , for simplicity , we will take it to be a mass independent constant given by ( [ eq : m0 ] ) .",
    "the only other parameter needed to evaluate the @xmath0-@xmath1 bubble contribution is the coupling of the scalar @xmath19 operator to the @xmath0-@xmath1 state , @xmath44 in the quenched theory in the chiral limit , we can relate the threshold value of this matrix element , via a soft-@xmath0 reduction , to the decay constant @xmath45 , the vacuum - to - one - pion matrix element of the pseudoscalar density . by this argument",
    ", we relate the coupling constant in ( @xmath46 ) to the @xmath47 vs. @xmath48 slope parameter @xmath49 determined in reference @xcite , @xmath50 thus , in this approximation the effect of the @xmath0-@xmath1 bubble , eq .",
    "( [ eq : b ] ) , is completely predicted by chiral symmetry in terms of the constants ( [ eq : m0 ] ) , ( [ eq : r0 ] ) , and the pion masses in table i. the result for the lightest quark mass ( @xmath51 ) is plotted along with the measured propagator in figure [ fig : sc_heavylight ] ( lower curve ) .",
    "considering that the plotted curve has _ no adjustable parameters _ , it fits the size and shape of the propagator remarkably well in the time range from @xmath52 to @xmath33 . for times",
    "@xmath53 , the measured propagator deviates from the one - loop expression in the positive direction , indicating that the spectral function also contains a heavy scalar meson .",
    "this short - range , positive metric exponential component dominates in the heavier quark cases where the chiral loop effect becomes unimportant .",
    "the one - loop result also explains the pion mass dependence of the anomalous propagator component , as shown in figure [ fig : t3456 ] , where we have plotted the value of the scalar propagator at various time separations as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the solid curves are the @xmath54 fourier transform at @xmath55 of the one - bubble integral ( [ eq : b ] ) , with @xmath43 and @xmath49 given by ( [ eq : m0 ] ) and ( [ eq : r0 ] ) . again",
    "the agreement with the data is surprisingly good , considering the absence of any adjustable parameters .",
    "the accurate description of both the time - dependence and the pion mass dependence leaves little doubt that , for the lightest quark masses , the scalar propagator over the range of times from about @xmath52 to 7 is completely dominated by the @xmath0-@xmath1 loop .",
    "furthermore , this agreement shows that the soft pion theorem relating the scalar - density matrix element ( [ eq : scdensity ] ) to the corresponding pseudoscalar matrix element is well satisfied by the lattice results .",
    "this is somewhat surprising at @xmath8 , where one might have expected substantial chiral symmetry violation from finite lattice - spacing effects .    for short time separations and/or heavier quark masses ,",
    "an accurate description of the scalar propagator requires positive contributions from scalar meson states along with the negative @xmath0-@xmath1 component . in the next section",
    ", we present a derivation of the quenched scalar propagator based on a detailed chiral lagrangian description which will be used to fit our data for all quark mass values .",
    "the corresponding propagator fits are discussed in section 4 .",
    "according to the analysis of bernard and golterman , low - energy quenched qcd is described by an effective local field theory with degrees of freedom corresponding to meson bound - states , including not only ordinary @xmath7 mesons , but also @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 mesons , where @xmath59 is a wrong - statistics ghost quark .",
    "order by order in the @xmath0 mass insertion @xmath11 , the ghost - quark formalism is easily seen to be equivalent to sharpe s formulation , which begins with a @xmath60 chiral lagrangian combined with rules inferred from the structure of quark - line diagrams in the quenched theory . in this paper , as in our previous analysis @xcite we follow the latter approach , invoking a chiral lagrangian having valence pion and @xmath6 degrees of freedom . to describe quenched qcd , the chiral lagrangian is supplemented with rules which reflect the suppression of internal quark loops . as a result , all normal pion loops are suppressed except for cactus diagrams involving the @xmath6 meson connected by single insertions of the hairpin mass term . using this procedure",
    "we obtained a consistent fit to our lattice data for the pseudoscalar valence and @xmath6 hairpin propagators and determined the relevant chiral lagrangian parameters .",
    "we now extend this analysis to the isovector , scalar propagator .",
    "the appropriate effective field theory must now include a multiplet of scalar mesons in addition to the pion and @xmath6 degrees of freedom . using standard chiral lagrangian methods ,",
    "the heavy scalar mesons are described by scalar fields transforming nonlinearly under chiral symmetry rotations .",
    "the resulting chiral lagrangian is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a chiral covariant derivative , @xmath63 the sigma mass , @xmath64 the strength of the chiral invariant coupling of sigma mesons to pions and @xmath65 the strength of the corresponding chiral symmetry breaking interactions .",
    "here we denote the scalar field by @xmath66 .",
    "( elsewhere , when referring to particle states , we use the conventional @xmath67 and @xmath12 to denote ground - state and excited - state mesons . )",
    "the chiral field matrix @xmath68 contains the pion and @xmath6 degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath6 mass term is given by the hairpin lagrangian , @xmath69 ^ 2 .",
    "\\;\\ ] ] we have not included interactions involving the couplings @xmath70 and @xmath71 used in our previous analysis of higher order terms in the sigma potential as they will have only small effects on our analysis of the isovector scalar propagator .",
    "scalar and pseudoscalar quark densities are represented by meson operators in the effective field theory and can be determined from the dependence of the chiral lagrangian on the spurion field @xmath72 .",
    "hence the isovector scalar density operator is given by @xmath73 with @xmath74 our previous fits to the pseudoscalar propagator determined the following values for the chiral lagrangian parameters , @xmath75    to lowest order , the local isovector scalar density may be expanded in terms of the pion , @xmath6 and sigma fields , @xmath76 at tree level , only the sigma propagator gives a positive contribution to the scalar propagator @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the @xmath67 meson propagator .",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath1 term can only contribute via a meson loop .",
    "however , the @xmath6 propagator in the loop is the @xmath6 hairpin propagator with a single insertion of the hairpin mass , @xmath11 ( see figure [ fig : quark_lines ] ) . including only these terms , the scalar propagator is @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the hairpin bubble @xmath81 and @xmath82 means the fourier transform on @xmath83 . as discussed in the introduction , the negative sign of the @xmath6 propagator in loops is dictated by the quenching and implies that this meson loop makes a negative contribution to the scalar propagator .",
    "it should also be noted that the @xmath6 propagator is more infrared singular than the normal valence pion propagator .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on the scalar propagator . in the light quark limit",
    ", the quenched theory predicts that large negative chiral loop effects should dominate the scalar propagator .",
    "our lattice data give convincing evidence for these effects .",
    "a complete analysis of the scalar propagator must go beyond the lowest order terms given above .",
    "the chiral lagrangian predicts couplings between the scalar meson and @xmath6-@xmath1 states as well as @xmath6-@xmath1 rescattering interactions generated by the symmetry breaking terms that give mass to the pion .",
    "these higher order terms involve @xmath6-@xmath1 bubble diagrams and can be resummed into a closed form .",
    "since the chiral invariant interactions between the @xmath66 and @xmath0-@xmath1 states include derivative couplings , bubbles with derivative couplings at the @xmath84 vertex must , in principle , also be included .",
    "these terms are less infrared singular than the nonderivative terms and are not expected to play a major role in explaining the large quenched effects seen in the data . in the following analysis , we will neglect such derivative coupling terms .",
    "the formulas and results given below are for the equal quark mass case ; generalizations to the unequal mass case are straightforward .",
    "as is always the case in propagator studies , the presence of excited states in the spectral function complicates the analysis . as we discussed in section ii , in addition to the propagator for local @xmath19 operators , we have calculated propagators with a smeared source at one or both ends . in our previous analysis of the pseudoscalar channel @xcite , a full multi - state fitting procedure was employed . here",
    "we take a somewhat simpler approach which is suggested by features of the data .",
    "we model the spectral function in terms of three components : ( 1 ) the @xmath0-@xmath1 state , ( 2 ) a ground - state scalar meson @xmath67 , and ( 3 ) an excited - state scalar meson @xmath85 .",
    "we perform an analysis of the local - local propagator by first using information from the smeared - local and smeared - smeared propagators to remove the excited - state @xmath12 scalar meson component and then fitting to a formula obtained by resumming all repeated bubble graphs involving the @xmath0-@xmath1 state and the ground - state @xmath67 scalar meson , as depicted in figure [ fig : bubblesum ] .",
    "to estimate and remove the contribution of the excited @xmath12 from the local propagator , we consider first the case with the heaviest quark , @xmath86 within statistics , all of the scalar propagators for smeared and local sources exhibit the same time - dependence beyond @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , the smeared - local and smeared - smeared propagators are equal , up to an overall factor , at all time slices , as evidenced by the effective mass plot in figure [ fig : effective_mass ] . for the heavier quark mass values ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 loop is relatively unimportant , and the smeared and local propagators can be analyzed in terms of a ground - state and excited - state scalar meson .",
    "the fact that the smeared - local and smeared - smeared propagators , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are proportional and that both give flat effective mass plots indicates that neither propagator has a significant excited - state component . on the other hand , the local - local propagator clearly has a significant @xmath12 component , as seen in the effective mass plot , figure [ fig : effective_mass ] .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the @xmath12 contribution by using the ( essentially time - independent ) ratio @xmath89 to determine the excited state component of @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 numerically , the above procedure applied to the @xmath22 propagators gives excited state parameters @xmath92 the large mass obtained emphasizes that the excited state contribution is only important at very short time separations .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , with no significant observed dependence on quark mass . with this information , we can separate off the excited state component of the local - local propagator : @xmath95 where @xmath96 includes contributions from the @xmath0-@xmath1 state and from the ground state scalar meson , and will be modelled by the bubble sum depicted in figure [ fig : bubblesum ] . for the lighter quark masses ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 state becomes important , and it is more difficult to disentangle the @xmath67 and @xmath12 contributions . in the fits to the local - local propagator described in the next section ,",
    "we have neglected the quark mass dependence of the excited state @xmath12 term and used the estimate ( [ eq : heavy ] ) for all quark masses .    by resumming the multiple bubble and scalar propagator graphs shown in figure [ fig : bubblesum ] , the full propagator may be written in terms of the one - loop bubble function @xmath37 defined in equation ( [ eq : b ] ) , @xmath97 where @xmath65 is the coupling of the scalar meson to the @xmath19 density , @xmath98 is the resummed multiple - bubble function , @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the resummed @xmath67 propagator , @xmath101 note that the negative sign associated with the hairpin insertion has been taken outside of the bubble function , i.e. the functions @xmath37 and @xmath98 are both positive .",
    "we use the bubble function @xmath37 defined for the lattice version of the full chiral lagrangian with the same lattice spacing as the quark lattice . in ( 20,21 ) , the lattice four - momentum is defined by @xmath102 as appropriate for bosonic propagators . if we are to use the pion masses in table i , which were determined from fitting the t - space pion propagators , then the pion masses used in lattice propagators above are given by @xmath103 .",
    "this analysis includes all contributions to the scalar propagator which can be computed by direct @xmath0-@xmath1 bubble summation and mixing with the @xmath67 scalar meson state .",
    "we use these expressions in our analysis of the lattice data on the isovector , scalar propagator .",
    "the quenched theory does introduce additional contributions which could modify the behavior of the bubble terms .",
    "for example , pions can interact through double hairpin exchange diagrams whose infrared behavior is doubly enhanced .",
    "therefore , virtual @xmath6 processes do not decouple in the infrared limit as is normally expected for soft pion interactions but can generate long range forces between mesons in the quenched theory .",
    "preliminary estimates of these effects indicate they are negligible for the range of pion masses and lattice volume considered in this paper and they have not been included in our analysis .",
    "in section 2 we showed that the data for the scalar propagator for heavier quark masses was dominated by the scalar meson @xmath67 intermediate state ( after removing the excited @xmath12 contribution , as discussed in that section ) , while for light masses , it is dominated by the @xmath0-@xmath1 intermediate state . to get a consistent fit for all masses",
    ", we have found that the resummed formula ( [ eq : bubblesum ] ) ( figure [ fig : bubblesum ] ) produces the most stable results .",

    "the scalar mass @xmath63 is well - determined for the heaviest quarks , but is poorly determined at the light - quark end . to obtain stable fits with @xmath43 as a fit parameter ,",
    "we fix @xmath63 to be given by a linear fit obtained from the three heaviest quark values , @xmath107 . where @xmath48 is the bare quark mass @xmath108 in lattice units .",
    "in this set of fits , @xmath65 is found to be approximately independent of quark mass and is well - approximated by ( [ eq : fs ] ) for all quark masses .",

    "a linear fit to this data gives @xmath109 in the chiral limit .",
    "this result , obtained from the scalar propagator data alone , is quite consistent with our previous estimates which included direct @xmath0 hairpin measurements , a topological susceptibility calculation , and qcl effects in the pseudoscalar channel @xcite .",
    "one feature of the scalar propagator which appears to be somewhat inconsistent with our theoretical model is the behavior at larger time separations , @xmath110 .",
    "for the lightest quarks , we saw that the propagator was well - described in the region @xmath52 to 6 by the one - loop @xmath0-@xmath1 bubble .",
    "however , beyond @xmath28 , the propagator appears to go to zero ( from below ) more rapidly than the theoretical curve predicted by either the one - loop calculation or the bubble - sum formula , as shown for @xmath111 in figure [ fig : tail_light ] . if it is a significant departure from the chiral symmetry prediction , it could be an indication of strong @xmath0-@xmath1 interactions near threshold .",
    "such interactions would normally be ruled out by soft - pion arguments , but may arise due either to explicit chiral symmetry breaking of the wilson - dirac action or because of higher order quenched effects . for the heaviest quarks , we also find that the propagator appears to have an additional positive contribution for @xmath110 .",
    "for example , we can obtain a good fit ( to both the heavy and light mass data at large time ) by adding a small @xmath1 propagator term to the fit model .",
    "however , the origin of such a contribution is not presently understood within our model .",
    "we have presented convincing evidence that the quenched scalar , isovector meson propagator exhibits a prominent `` quenched chiral loop '' ( qcl ) artifact at light quark mass which is properly interpreted as the effect of an @xmath0-@xmath1 intermediate state .",
    "qcl effects that have been observed in other quantities @xcite have been rather subtle , involving relatively small deviations from full qcd chiral behavior .",
    "by contrast , the qcl effect discussed here is an unmistakable chiral power singularity , and in fact dominates the scalar correlator for the lightest quark masses we have studied .",
    "the negative spectral weight of this contribution is a particularly vivid illustration of the oft - stated truism that the quenched approximation violates unitarity .",
    "the results presented here also provide further evidence of the effectiveness of the pole - shifting ansatz of the modified quenched approximation .",
    "it is only after pole - shifting that we are able to study the lightest quark masses for which the @xmath0-@xmath1 state becomes obvious .",
    "it should be remarked , however , that even for the heavier quark masses , the qcl effect is not negligible , and must be included in the fitting function in order to draw correct conclusions about the scalar meson mass .",
    "for example , fitting the scalar propagator at the heavier quark masses with a simple exponential and ignoring the @xmath0-@xmath1 contribution would lead to the erroneous conclusion that the scalar meson becomes _ heavier _ as the quark mass gets lighter .",
    "the resulting effect on the chiral extrapolation is at least as severe as typical qcl effects in the quenched light hadron spectrum . for pion masses below about 400 mev ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 contribution becomes dominant , making the scalar meson mass difficult to determine accurately .",
    "nevertheless , by combining lattice calculations with quenched chiral perturbation theory , more extensive studies of scalar meson spectroscopy in the quenched approximation should be feasible .",
    "finally , the prominence of the qcl effect in the scalar valence propagator suggests that this propagator be added to the list of standard bellwether quantities ( such as topological susceptibility , @xmath0 mass , and long - range static potential ) which are expected to be particularly sensitive to the difference between quenched and full qcd gauge ensembles .",

    "<S> the scalar , isovector meson propagator is analyzed in quenched qcd , using the mqa pole - shifting ansatz to study the chiral limit . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the expected short - range exponential falloff characteristic of a heavy scalar meson , the propagator also exhibits a longer - range , negative metric contribution which becomes pronounced for smaller quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is a quenched chiral loop effect associated with the anomalous structure of the @xmath0 propagator in quenched qcd . </S>",
    "<S> both the time dependence and the quark mass dependence of this effect are well - described by a chiral loop diagram corresponding to an @xmath0-@xmath1 intermediate state , which is light and effectively of negative norm in the quenched approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant parameters of the effective lagrangian describing the scalar sector of the quenched theory are determined .    </S>",
