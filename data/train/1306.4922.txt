    "there is a natural @xmath4 action on moduli spaces of translation surfaces , discussed in more detail below .",
    "its study is the central purpose of teichmller dynamics , and has diverse applications to the dynamics and geometry of interval exchange transformations and rational billiards , and related problems in physics .",
    "typical questions about translation surfaces include : what are the asymptotics for the number of cylinders of length at most @xmath5 ?",
    "how can the surface be decomposed into simpler pieces , respecting the flat geometry ?",
    "what is the dynamical behavior of the directional flow in most directions ?",
    "what are the deviations of ergodic averages for the directional flow ?    precisely answering most of these questions for a given surface usually requires first knowing its orbit closure .",
    "indeed , the orbit closure is the arena in which much of the study of a translation surface occurs : the @xmath4 action on this orbit closure provides the renormalization dynamics for the directional flow on the surface , and how the orbit closure sits inside of the ambient moduli space determines whether and how often certain geometric configurations can be found inside the surface .",
    "let @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . recall that @xmath8 is the moduli space of pairs @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a riemann surface and @xmath3 is a holomorphic one - form ( abelian differential ) on @xmath2 having @xmath9 zeros of orders @xmath10 .",
    "elements of @xmath8 are called _",
    "translation surfaces_. it is well known that @xmath8 is an algebraic variety and also a complex orbifold of dimension @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is a natural action of @xmath4 on each stratum @xmath8 .",
    "every translation surface can be obtained from a collection of polygons in @xmath12 by gluing pairs of parallel edges with equal length , and the @xmath4 action is obtained from the linear action on the polygons in @xmath12 .",
    "see the surveys @xcite for a more detailed introduction .",
    "it turns out that the geometric and dynamic features of a specific translation surface are usually encoded in the closure of its @xmath4-orbit ( see  @xcite ) .    the space @xmath8 carries a natural volume form called the _ masur - veech measure_. by the work of masur and veech , the action of @xmath13 is ergodic on the locus of unit area surfaces in each connected component of @xmath8 with respect to this measure . as a consequence , for almost every surface @xmath1 in @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath4-orbit of @xmath1 is dense in a connected component of @xmath8 .",
    "we will call such @xmath1 _ generic surfaces_. on the other hand , every stratum contains infinitely many _ square - tiled surfaces _ , and these surfaces have closed @xmath4-orbits .    in genus two , a complete classification of @xmath4-orbit closures has been obtained by mcmullen  @xcite .",
    "there are also some partial results by calta  @xcite and hubert - lelivre  @xcite . using similar ideas , explicit examples of generic surfaces in the hyperelliptic locus @xmath14 and in @xmath0",
    "were constructed by hubert - lanneau - mller and the first author  @xcite .",
    "recently eskin - mirzakhani  @xcite , and eskin - mirzakhani - mohammadi  @xcite , with a contribution by avila - eskin - mller  @xcite , proved that all @xmath4-orbit closures are submanifolds of @xmath8 which are complex linear subspaces in local period coordinates ( see section  [ sec : fund : results ] ) .",
    "this confirmed a longstanding conjecture and has lead to further progress .",
    "the structure theory of affine invariant manifolds was developed by the second author in @xcite , in particular leading to an explicit full measure set of generic translation surfaces in each stratum .",
    "furthermore the geometry of translation surfaces has been directly connected to orbit closures via the cylinder deformation theorem of the second author in @xcite ; this will be one of our main tools below .",
    "conjectures of mirzakhani ( see @xcite ) predict that there are in fact very few orbit closures , and those that do exist have special properties enjoyed by the current list of known examples .",
    "this work is the first partial verification of these conjectures in genus greater than 2 .",
    "kontsevich - zorich have classified the connected components of strata @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are always at most three connected components .",
    "the stratum @xmath15 has only two components : @xmath0 and @xmath16 . here",

    ", we have the following    [ cor : algebraic ] any @xmath4 orbit closure in @xmath0 is an algebraic variety .    a proof of the conjecture that any @xmath4-orbit closure in any stratum is an algebraic variety has been announced in some recent preprints  @xcite by s.  filip .",
    "theorem [ th : main : hyp4 ] is false for the other connected component @xmath16 of @xmath15 .",
    "nonetheless , our methods are applicable to the study of orbit closures in @xmath16 ( see   @xcite ) and in even broader generality ( for instance in the other strata of three translation surfaces ) .",
    "recall the celebrated veech dichotomy , which states that if the orbit of @xmath1 is closed , then in every direction with a saddle connection , the surface can be decomposed into parallel cylinders whose moduli are rational multiples of each other ; and in every direction without a saddle connection , the straight line flow is uniquely ergodic .",
    "a corollary of this dichotomy and theorem [ th : main : hyp4 ] is the following .",
    "if @xmath18 has a saddle connection such that in this direction the surface is not the union of parallel cylinders whose moduli are rational multiples of each other , then @xmath1 is generic .",
    "we suspect that every non - veech surface in @xmath0 has a saddle connection such that in this direction the surface is not the union of parallel cylinders whose moduli are rational multiples of each other .",
    "combining theorem [ th : main : hyp4 ] with work in preparation of the second author and matheus @xcite , we immediately get    [ th : fin ] there are at most finitely many non - arithmetic closed orbits ( teichmller curves ) in @xmath0 .",

    "we will give only a short discussion of the context .    a closed orbit is non - arithmetic if it does not contain a square - tiled surface .",
    "the assumption of non - arithmeticity is weaker than the typical assumption of algebraic primitivity ( which will not be defined here ) .",

    "all known finiteness results use foundational work of mller @xcite , but the techniques of @xcite additionally use eskin - mirzakhani - mohammadi @xcite and reduce many finiteness problems for teichmller curves to existence problems for larger orbit closures with unlikely properties .    a weaker statement ( finiteness of algebraically primitive teichmller curves ) than theorem [ th : fin ] was conjectured and discussed in the work of bainbridge and mller @xcite .",
