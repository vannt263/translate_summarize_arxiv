    "one can try , for example , to solve the inequalities @xmath12 in the cuntz semigroup of @xmath4 for fixed positive integers @xmath8 and @xmath10 ( typically with @xmath13 ) .",

    "remark  [ rem : j - s ] .",
    "this leads us to a useful observation , which loosely can be formulated as follows : if @xmath4 and @xmath25 are unital @xmath0-algebras , and if there is a unital @xmath15-homomorphism from @xmath4 to @xmath25 , then the divisibility properties of @xmath25 are no worse than those of @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath4 has better divisibility properties than @xmath25 , then you can not unitally embed @xmath4 into @xmath25 .",

    "good comparability and divisibility properties are necessary and sufficient conditions in winter s theorem , @xcite , to conclude that a simple , separable , unital @xmath0-algebra with locally finite nuclear dimension tensorially absorbs the jiang - su algebra . also , good comparability and divisibility properties are both necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that the cuntz semigroup of a simple , separable , unital , exact @xmath0-algebra @xmath4 is ( naturally ) isomorphic to @xmath29 , cf .",

    "the existence of simple @xmath0-algebras with bad comparability properties was discovered by villadsen , @xcite , in the mid 1990 s .",

    "villadsen s example in @xcite has been generalized extensively by several authors ( including villadsen himself ) to exhibit simple @xmath0-algebras with various kinds of unexpected behaviour , including many ways of failing to have good comparability properties .",
    "however , little work has been done to construct simple @xmath0-algebras with bad divisibility behaviour , and the literature does not contain systematic ways of producing such examples . in this paper",
    "we show that there is a duality between comparability and divisibility ( lemma  [ lm : z ] ) , and we use this duality to construct examples of simple and non - simple @xmath0-algebras with bad divisibility behaviour .",

    "each such @xmath0-algebra will of course have non - trivial central sequences .",
    "dadarlat and toms proved in @xcite that if the infinite tensor power @xmath30 of a fixed unital @xmath0-algebra @xmath4 contains a unital copy of an ahs - algebra without characters , then it automatically absorbs the jiang - su algebra .",

    "simple @xmath0-algebras are sometimes thought of as being very homogeneous , as for example in @xcite . from this point of view it may at first be surprising that a simple infinite dimensional @xmath0-algebra can fail to have good divisibility properties .",

    "in section  [ sec : infinite ] we consider what one might call  super - divisibility \" , which leads to a ( new ) notion of infiniteness of positive elements ( and which implies that a multiple of the given element is properly infinite ) .",
    "we use this to reformulate the corona factorization property of semigroups considered in @xcite .",
    "we study variations of examples , originally due to dixmier and douady , and answer in this way two questions from @xcite in the negative : the sum of two properly infinite positive elements need not be properly infinite , and the multiplier algebra of a @xmath0-algebra which has a properly infinite strictly positive element need not be properly infinite .",
