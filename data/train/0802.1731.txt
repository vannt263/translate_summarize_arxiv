    "one of the primary goals of our planet search at keck observatory , which began collecting precise radial velocities ( rvs ) of nearby sun - like stars in earnest in april 1997 , was to discover the first signpost of a true solar system analog , a jupiter twin .",
    "this would require high precision ( @xmath4 m / s ) measurements stable over @xmath5 years of regular observation to detect the 12 m / s ( modulo @xmath6 ) , sinusoidal signal induced by a 1 @xmath2  object over a @xmath7 year period . a survey would also have to measure the effects of stellar activity cycles on the long - term rv stability of sun - like stars , since such cycles have periods of @xmath7 years , similar to those of the orbits of jupiter - type planets .",
    "now , with the recent passage of the 10 year anniversary of our first observations at keck , we announce that we have achieved these goals and present the first veritable jupiter analog .",
    "the 10 year baseline of precise velocities has already revealed several long - period planets , including the following with @xmath8 yr : an @xmath9 @xmath2  planet in an eccentric orbit around hd 72659 @xcite ; planets in eccentric orbits with interior gas giants around hd 190360 and hd 217107 @xcite ; and 55 cnc _ d _",
    "@xcite , an @xmath10 @xmath2  planet in a circular orbit and the outermost member of an extraordinary 5-planet system ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 , _ apj _ accepted ) .",
    "the _ catalog of nearby exoplanets_exoplanets.org/ ] @xcite counts 12 other nearby planets with @xmath11 yr discovered to date .    characterization of these planets is complicated by their long periods : while normally we prefer to observe multiple orbits before announcing a planet so that we can separate the effects of additional planets in the system , such caution can be impractical when orbital periods exceed 8 years .",
    "@xcite developed techniques for constraining the minimum mass of long - period planets , including hd 154345_b _ , whose orbits were apparently nearly complete but nonetheless lacked well - constrained periods . since that work s publication , hd 154345_b _ has completed its orbit , revealing its minimum mass , period , and eccentricity all to be at the low end of the range of plausible values listed in @xcite .",
    "hd 154345 joins 55 cnc in demonstrating that the architecture of the solar system  a dominant , jupiter - mass planet at 45 au in a circular orbit with only lower - massed objects interior  while rare , is not unique .",
    "hd  154345 (= gj 651 ) is a bright , nearby , somewhat metal - poor g8 dwarf .",
    "its mount wilson @xmath12-index of 0.18 is only slightly higher than the minimum seen for stars of similar @xmath13 , metallicity , and evolutionary status ( j. t. wright , in prep . ) , indicating that it is likely an old ( age @xmath14 gyr ) , slowly - rotating field star .",
    "table  [ star ] contains compiled stellar data for hd  154345 from the spocs catalog @xcite , _ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite , and the activity catalog of @xcite .",
    "being metal poor , hd 154345 sits just below the main sequence , ( it has negative @xmath15 ) as computed in @xcite .",
    "stars of this color and activity level typically exhibit r.m.s radial velocity variations of 2 - 5.5 m @xmath16@xcite , an estimate which includes systematic errors as well as any astrophysical noise intrinsic to the star .",
    "this is an overestimate for the data presented here , because of the large number of data points taken since upgrades at hires in august 2004 decreased our systematic errors down to 1.5 m @xmath16 at worst .",
    "we thus adopt a uniform `` jitter '' estimate of 2.5 m @xmath16  for this work .    in table",
    "[ vels ] we present the 55 radial velocity measurements we have collected for this star since 1997 , using the iodine technique @xcite .",
    "typical exposure times in good weather were @xmath17 minute .",
    "we have fit the data under the assumption that hd 154345_b _ is the only planet in the system , binning the data in 3-day bins before adding our jitter estimate in quadrature with random errors .",
    "the velocities are consistent with an @xmath18 @xmath2  planet in a circular 4.2 au orbit and no other companions .",
    "lower jitter estimates yield a best fit with slightly larger eccentricity . fig .",
    "[ 154345 ] shows the best fit , and table  [ orbit ] contains the best - fit parameters , with errors computed using the bootstrapping technique described in @xcite .",
    "we monitor all of our program stars for variations in chromospheric activity , extracting mount wilson @xmath12-indices from our rv science spectra ( h. isaacson , _ in preparation _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have found that hd 154345 shows clear evidence of a stellar cycle .",
    "[ s ] shows that the magnetic activity level of hd 154345 varies sinusoidally with a @xmath3 9-year period .",
    "photometric monitoring from fairborn observatory @xcite confirms the presence of this activity cycle : fig .",
    "[ 154345phot ] shows a @xmath3 1 mmag photometric variation in phase with the chromospheric emission .",
    "@xcite observed an apparent drift in line centroids of co transitions at 2.3 @xmath19 m in the integrated solar spectrum over a 3-year span .",
    "they associated these shifts with changes in the activity level of the sun over that period , and suggested that activity cycles on sun - like stars could thus mimic the rv signature of a long - period exoplanet .",
    "the apparent coincidence of the phase of hd 154345 s magnetic cycle with that of the radial velocities in the same sense at the shifts seen by @xcite therefore demands that we take a closer look at the effects of stellar activity cycles on radial velocities measured in the optical .",
    "the mount wilson h & k activity survey @xcite identified several stars of similar color to hd 154345 as exhibiting activity variations consistent with cycles .",
    "we have over 6 years of rv data at keck for a total of four of these stars : hd 26965 , hd 3795 , hd 10476 , and hd 185144 , the latter three of which we have monitored regularly at keck for over 10 years .",
    "hd 10476 , hd 26965 , and hd 185144 all have sufficiently strong cycles that we can confirm their continued coherence since the end of the published mount wilson data from our own activity measurements .",
    "none of these four stars shows rv variations similar to hd 154345 , or any correlation of @xmath12-index with rv .",
    "in fact , all of these stars show r.m.s .",
    "rv variations of less than 5 m @xmath16 , and one , hd 185144 , is among the most rv - stable stars in our entire sample .",
    "we focus here on hd 185144 because its activity cycle is so clear and it is one of the best - observed stars on our program .",
    "[ s ] shows that this star has a similar cycle period to that of hd 154345 , but with a higher mean activity level and larger variations .",
    "* left column , fifth panel from top ) ] .",
    "[ 185144phot ] shows fairborn observatory photometry of hd 185144 which confirms the existence , strength , period , and phase of this cycle .    despite these clear activity variations ,",
    "hd 185144 is one of the most stable stars on our program .",
    "we have monitored hd 185144 intensely at keck observatory since 1997 and made more than 350 observations on more than 60 nights over the past 10 years ( since the activity and rv measurements are taken from the same spectra , fig .",
    "[ s ] also shows the temporal coverage of our rv observations ) .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "scatter of the rv variations over this entire period is less than 2.5 m @xmath16 .",
    "based on these four stars , we conclude that long - term radial velocity variations are generally not seen in the optical absorption lines of late g stars undergoing magnetic activity cycles , even cycles as strong as those in hd 185144 .",
    "we note that the sun s 11-year activity cycle has a period similar to that of jupiter s orbit , and that the mount wilson survey demonstrated that decadal activity cycles are a common feature of old g stars @xcite .",
    "we thus consider the fact that hd 154345 exhibits an activity cycle with a period and phase similar to that of its jupiter twin to be an inevitable coincidence .",
    "the orbital solution presented here is sensitive to the assumption that the signal from any other planets in the system is not significant .",
    "the residuals to this fit show no significant periodicities , consistent with there being no interior planets with @xmath20 .",
    "our intense monitoring of this system at 1 m @xmath16  precision since 2007 will provide increasingly stringent limits on the existence of any interior giant planets .. while signals such as these are intriguing , they are not persuasive , and any conclusions drawn from them would be highly speculative . ]    one of the difficulties of having only observed a single orbit is in excluding the possibility of a detectable exterior planet .",
    "for instance , a saturn analog in this system would contribute a low - amplitude , long - term signal which might be absorbed in the eccentricity term of the orbital solution above .",
    "long - term monitoring of this system will eventually break this degeneracy .",
    "hd  154345_b _ will likely not be detected by other methods within the next few years .",
    "its large orbital distance makes transits extremely unlikely , but interior planets may be detectable if their inclination is favorable and their orbital radius small .",
    "measurement of the @xmath21 @xmath19as astrometric signature of hd  154345_b _ over its 9-year orbit would determine the orientation of the orbital plane of this system and resolve the @xmath6 ambiguity in the rv - derived mass is 1.15 , and the true value for any given system will be within 20% of that number , with 68% confidence . ] .",
    "the planet is separated from its parent star by a maximum of 02 with a prohibitive contrast of @xmath22 magnitudes ( the age of the planet means it has little intrinsic infrared luminosity and at 4.2 au the planet will reflect and reprocess very little light ) .",
    "the brightness and proximity of hd 154345 , however , will make this system a natural target for future spaceborne efforts , such as sim and tpf .",
    "the large , apparently empty region interior to hd  154345_b _ should be a prime target for these and other efforts to detect terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around a sun - like star .",
    "we wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services , and is made possible by the generous support of nasa and the nsf , including grant ast-0307493 .",
