    "nowadays , magnetic nanostructures i.e. nanoparticles such as nanorods , nanobelts , nanowires and nanotubes have drawn considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental points of view , due to their technological @xcite and biomedical @xcite applications such as information storage devices and drug delivery in cancer thermotherapy . in general , these fine particles are used for manufacturing biosensors @xcite and permanent magnets @xcite .",
    "recent developments in the experimental techniques allow the scientists to fabricate such kinds of fine nanoscaled materials @xcite , and the magnetization of certain nanomaterials such as @xmath0 nanoparticles has been experimentally measured @xcite . in particular , magnetic nanowires and nanotubes such as @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite can be synthesized by various experimental techniques and they have many applications in nanotechnology @xcite , and they are also utilized as raw materials in fabrication of ultra - high density magnetic recording media @xcite .    on the theoretical side , much effort has also been devoted , and these systems have been studied by a wide variety of techniques such as mean field theory ( mft ) @xcite , effective field theory ( eft ) with correlations @xcite , green functions ( gf ) formalism @xcite , variational cumulant expansion ( vce ) @xcite , and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulation @xcite is regarded as a powerful numerical approach for simulating the behavior of many complex systems , including magnetic nanoparticle systems .",
    "for instance , by utilizing this tool , refs .",
    "@xcite investigated the exchange bias effect in magnetic core - shell nanoparticles where the hysteresis loop exhibits a shift below the nel temperature of the antiferromagnetic shell due to the exchange coupling at the interface region of ferromagnetic core and antiferromagnetic shell .",
    "furthermore , according to recent monte carlo studies , it has been shown that the core - shell concept can be successfully applied in nanomagnetism since it is capable of explaining various characteristic behaviors observed in nanoparticle magnetism @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , eft which is superior to conventional mft has been introduced for the first time by kaneyoshi for ferroelectric nanoparticles @xcite . in a series of the consecutive studies , he extended the theory for the investigation of thermal and magnetic properties of the nanoscaled transverse ising thin films @xcite , and also for cylindrical nanowire and nanotube systems @xcite .",
    "magnetic nanoparticles serve as a bridge between bulk materials and atomic or molecular structures .",
    "physical properties of a bulk material are independent from size of the material ; however , below a critical size , nanoparticles often exhibit size - dependent properties and some unique phenomena such as superparamagnetism @xcite , quantum tunneling of the magnetization @xcite , and unusual large coercivities @xcite have been reported . as an example",
    ", it has been experimentally shown that @xmath4 ( lcmn ) nanoparticle exhibits a negative core - shell coupling , although the bulk lcmn is a ferromagnet @xcite . moreover , as a theoretical example , the total magnetizations in a nanoscaled transverse ising thin film with thickness @xmath5 are investigated by the use of both the eft with correlations and the mft , and it has been shown that the magnetization may exhibit two compensation points with the increasing film thickness @xcite . the phenomenon of the observation of two compensation points in the nanoscaled thin films has also been reported for bulk ferrimagnetic materials @xcite . however , the origin of the existence of such a compensation point in the nanoscaled magnets are quite different from those observed in the bulk ferrimagnetic materials .",
    "namely , a compensation point originates in the bulk systems due to the different temperature dependence of the atomic moments of the sublattices . however , nanoscaled magnetic particles such as nanowires or nanotubes exhibit a compensation point , due to the presence of an antiferromagnetic interface coupling between the core and the shell , even if the lattice sites in the particle core and shell are occupied by identical atomic moments . hence , theoretical investigation of ferrimagnetism in nanoparticle systems",
    "has opened a new field in the research of the critical phenomena in nanoscaled magnetic particles @xcite .    despite the growing technological advancements , it is still hard to fabricate pure nanomaterials .",
    "the existence of a disorder , such as site or bond disorder in magnetic nanoparticle systems constitutes an important role in material science , since it may induce some important macroscopic effects on the thermal and magnetic properties of these materials .",
    "for instance , magnetic properties of @xmath6 particles with magnetically disordered surface layer , and the surface spin disorder in @xmath7 nanoparticles have been investigated previously @xcite . in addition , spin - glass surface disorder in antiferromagnetic small particles @xcite , and site dilution in surface shell of cylindrical ising nanowire ( or nanotube ) systems @xcite have been examined , theoretically . however , to our knowledge , diluted interface and surface shell bonds in the core - shell nanoparticles have not yet been examined in detail , and the situation deserves particular attention .",
    "therefore , aim of this study is to clarify within the framework of eft with correlations , how the magnetism in a nanoparticle system is affected in the presence of disordered bonds in the surface shell and also in the interface between the core and shell layers of the particle . for this purpose ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ formulation ] , we briefly present our model and related formulation . the results and discussions",
    "are presented in section [ results ] , and finally section [ conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions .",

    "the system is composed of a ferromagnetic core which is surrounded by a ferromagnetic shell layer . at the interface ,",
    "we define an exchange interaction between core and shell spins which can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic type .",
    "hamiltonian equation describing our model can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",

    "following the same methodology given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can get the usual coupled eft equations for the magnetizations of core and shell layers of nanowire system as follows @xmath15^{4 }    [ a_{3}+m_{2}b_{3 } ]     [ a_{3}+m_{3}b_{3}]^{2 } \\\\",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) can be obtained by using the probability distributions given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and the relation @xmath24 @xcite .    with the help of binomial expansion , eq .",

    "hence , in order to obtain the critical temperature we may linearize eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the selected values of the system parameters , the transition temperature of the system can be obtained from @xmath37 .",
    "finally , we should note that , as is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath38 which means that the phase diagrams are independent of the sign of @xmath12 .",
    "in this section , we will discuss how the disordered shell and interface bonds of the particle affect the phase diagrams of the system . in the following discussions ,",
    "we consider a pure core layer with @xmath39 , and also we fix the exchange interaction of the core spins as @xmath40 .",
    "we will also consider both ferromagnetic @xmath41 and antiferromagnetic @xmath42 interface coupling properties of the system . as is stated above",
    ", phase diagrams corresponding to ferromagnetic interface coupling are also valid for the system with antiferromagnetic interface coupling .",
    "critical temperature of the system at which a phase transition occurs does not change since eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath38 .",
    "however , in contrast to the ferromagnetic case , the nanowire system with a negative interface coupling may exhibit a novel phenomenon , namely a compensation point which does not occur in the ferromagnetic case .",
    "compensation point is of particular interest , since this phenomenon has important technological applications in magneto - optical recording devices .",
    "in addition , nanoscaled magnets such as nanowires , nanotubes , etc . are currently considered as promising candidates due to their potential utilization as ultra - high density recording media .        +    +    in fig .",

[ fig4]b ) .",

    "<S> a cylindrical magnetic nanowire system composed of ferromagnetic core and shell layers has been investigated by using effective field theory with correlations . both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic </S>",
    "<S> exchange couplings at the core - shell interface have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> main attention has been focused on the effects of the quenched disordered shell bonds , as well as interface bonds on the magnetic properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> a complete picture of the phase diagrams and magnetization profiles has been represented . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that for the antiferromagnetic nanowire system , the magnetization curves can be classified according to nel theory of ferrimagnetism and it has been found that under certain conditions , the magnetization profiles may exhibit q - type , p - type , n - type and l - type behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> the observed l - type behavior has not been reported in the literature before for the equilibrium properties of nanoscaled magnets . </S>",
    "<S> as another interesting feature of the system , it has been found that a compensation point can be induced by a bond dilution process in the surface . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have not found any evidence of neither the first order phase transition characteristics , nor the reentrance phenomena . </S>"
