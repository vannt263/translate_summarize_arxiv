    "there are several reasons for studying purely leptonic decays of charged @xmath1 mesons .",
    "such processes are rare but they have clear experimental signatures due to the presence of a highly energetic lepton in the final state .",
    "the theoretical predictions are very clean due to the absence of hadrons in the final state .",
    "these features make such decays the ideal ground to look for deviations from the standard model ( sm ) predictions hoping for some signs of new physics ( np ) .",
    "furthermore , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : blnu ] , measuring the branching fraction ( bf ) of these modes allows direct insight into some of the fundamental parameters of the theory , that are not easily accessible otherwise .    in this review",
    "we will describe some of the latest results on leptonic and radiative leptonic decays of charged @xmath1 mesons obtained at the @xmath1-factory experiments , belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite , both collecting @xmath4 pairs at the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "the common characteristic of all the analyses described is the presence of one ( for electronic and muonic modes ) or more ( for the tauonic mode ) neutrinos in the signal @xmath1 ( @xmath6 ) . to suppress background and constrain kinematically the @xmath6 reconstruction , the common solution is to reconstruct the other @xmath1 meson in the event , usually referred to as tag , companion or recoil @xmath1 ( @xmath7 in our notation ) .",
    "the @xmath7 reconstruction can be performed inclusively , by reconstructing and identifying all particles in the event that do not belong to the signal and using them to form a @xmath1 candidate , or exclusively , by selecting several decay modes adding up to a reasonable bf and reconstructing @xmath7 in these modes .",
    "a great reduction of the continuum background is obtained by selecting events in which the @xmath7 candidate is kinematically consistent with a @xmath1 meson issued from the decay of a @xmath8 .",
    "the selection is usually performed on the two following variables : the beam constrained mass ( called @xmath9 by belle and @xmath10 by babar ) @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the momentum and energy of @xmath7 , all variables being evaluated in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame . for @xmath4 events , @xmath9 is centered at the value of the @xmath1 mass and @xmath15 at zero . the advantage of exclusive @xmath7 selections is the very powerful suppression of background , at the price of a relatively small signal efficiency .",
    "inclusive selections can give higher efficiencies , but are better suited for channels in which the signal signature allows a good separation from background .",
    "as we will describe in the following , both techniques have been pursued with success by belle and babar .",
    "purely leptonic decays of charged @xmath1 mesons proceed in the sm via the @xmath16-mediated annihilation tree diagram , with a branching fraction given by : [ eq : b2lnu ] + & & m_^2 ( 1-)^2 f_b^2 |v_ub|^2 _ b , where @xmath17 is the @xmath1 meson lifetime , @xmath18 is the @xmath1 decay constant and @xmath19 an element of the ckm - matrix .",
    "these modes are very interesting because they give direct access to the product @xmath20 , from which one can extract a measurement of @xmath18 , since @xmath19 is measured in other @xmath1 decay modes  @xcite .",
    "the sm expectation for @xmath21 is @xmath22 , assuming for @xmath19 the value @xmath23 determined by inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath1 decay data  @xcite , @xmath24 ps  @xcite , and @xmath25 @xmath26 obtained from lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "decays to lighter leptons are helicity suppressed , and are their bf are predicted to be @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . allowing for np decay amplitudes , measurements of these processes can give stringent limits on important parameters of such sm extensions , such as the mass of the charged higgs boson and @xmath31 ( the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ) in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm)@xcite .",
    "both belle and babar have recently presented results of searches for the @xmath32 decay . compared to the lighter leptonic modes , this channel has the disadvantage of additional neutrinos ( one or more , depending on the @xmath33 decay mode ) .",
    "the belle analysis  @xcite is based on a data sample of 414  fb@xmath34 and it employs a full reconstruction of @xmath7 in the following decay modes : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "are assigned to @xmath6 and a decay to a @xmath33 and a neutrino is looked for .",
    "the @xmath33 lepton is identified in five decay modes , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which taken together correspond to @xmath60 of all @xmath33 decays .",
    "further background suppression is obtained by applying requirements on the magnitude and direction of the missing momentum .",
    "the most powerful variable for separating signal and background is the remaining energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) , denoted as @xmath61 , which is the sum of the energies of neutral clusters that are not associated with either the @xmath7 or the @xmath62 candidate from the @xmath63 decay . for signal events",

    "background events are distributed toward higher @xmath61 due to the contribution from additional neutral clusters .",
    "a validation of the @xmath61 simulation is performed using a control sample of double tagged events where the @xmath64 is fully reconstructed as described above and @xmath65 is reconstructed in the decay chain , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , followed by @xmath68 or @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a muon or an electron .",
