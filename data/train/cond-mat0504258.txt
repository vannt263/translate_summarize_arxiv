    "theoretical investigation on the effects of nonlocality in electron - phonon coupling @xcite has grown considerably during the last years in conjunction with the large interest for organic molecular crystals @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite and conducting polymers exhibiting polaronic properties . in the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh )",
    "hamiltonian @xcite the electronic hopping is accompanied by a relative displacement between adjacent atomic sites that causes a nonlocal _ e - ph _ coupling with vertex function depending both on the electronic and the phononic wave vector .",
    "this feature leads to peculiar static and dynamical properties @xcite for the ssh model which also displays dimension dependent mass behavior for the acoustical polarons @xcite . in a path integral investigation of the equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "we have shown @xcite that the purely electronic hopping dominates the low temperature thermodynamics as it is responsible for a characteristic upturn in the heat capacity over @xmath0 ratio pointing to a glassy like behavior in the one dimensional chain . moreover",
    ", phonon anharmonicities induced by _ e - ph _ interactions can be large in the ssh model due to the time retarded nature of the perturbing source current @xcite .    in the holstein model ,",
    "the coupling of electrons to dispersionless optical phonons is essentially local and the electronic energy at a lattice site linearly depends on the atomic displacement at that site @xcite .",
    "thus , in the strong coupling regime , the unit comprising electron plus induced lattice deformation is generally a small object ( on the lattice scale ) undergoing a sizeable mass renormalization .",
    "large adiabaticities may however induce a spread in the real space for the holstein polaron which accordingly becomes lighter .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in higher dimensionality @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersive nature of the phonon spectrum is recognized as a fundamental feature of the holstein model as it allows for finite values of the electronic site jump probability while a dispersionless model would lead to unphysical divergences @xcite .",
    "also ground state properties such as electron bandwidth and effective mass are more properly evaluated versus dimensionality within a dispersive model . in this paper",
    "we investigate to which extent the realistic assumption of dispersive phonons may induce non local correlations which consistently renormalize the effective _ e - ph _ coupling both in one- and two - dimensions .",
    "we emphasize that the model and the results hereafter presented , being valid for any coupling strength , are independent of the existence of small polarons in the system .",
    "unlike the ssh model , the holstein electron hopping does not induce a shift in the atomic displacement .",
    "thus the perturbing _ e - ph _ current does not depend on the electronic paths and , along the time scale , it turns out to be intrinsecally local . applying space - time mapping techniques",
    "@xcite we show that this feature allows an elegant path integral formulation @xcite of the holstein partition function in which electron and dispersive phonon coordinates appear to be decoupled . section ii outlines the hamiltonian model while the path integral method is described in section iii .",
    "the results of our work are reported on in section iv and some final remarks are given in section v.",
    "we consider the dimension dependent holstein hamiltonian consisting of : i ) one electron hopping term , ii ) an interaction which couples the electronic density ( @xmath2 ) to the phonon creation ( @xmath3 ) and annihilation ( @xmath4 ) operators at a given site * l * , iii ) dispersive harmonic optical phonons :    @xmath5    the first sum is over @xmath6 nearest neighbors , @xmath7 is the tight binding overlap integral .",
    "@xmath8 is the fourier transform of @xmath3 and @xmath9 is the frequency of the phonon with vector momentum @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the _ e - ph _ coupling in energy units .",
    "the phonons operators can be written in terms of the isotropic displacement field @xmath12 as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the atomic mass .",
    "then , the _ e - ph _ term in ( 1 ) transforms as follows :    @xmath15    the sum over * n * spans all @xmath16 neighbors sites of the * l * lattice site in any dimensionality .",
    "thus , although the holstein hamiltonian assumes a local _ e - ph _ interaction , the dispersive nature of the phonon spectrum clearly introduces _ e - ph _ real space correlations which renormalize the dimension dependent effective coupling .",
    "fourier transforming the atomic displacement field and taking the lattice constant @xmath17 , from eq.(3 ) we obtain for a linear chain and a square lattice respectively :    @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\ { } & + & 2   \\sum_{m , n=1}^{n^ * } \\bigl [ \\cos\\bigl ( m(q^{\\prime}_x - q_x ) + n ( q^{\\prime}_y - q_y)\\bigr )    \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\cos\\bigl (       m(q^{\\prime}_x - q_x ) - n(q^{\\prime}_y - q_y ) \\bigr ) \\bigr ] \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while , in principle , the sum over @xmath19 should cover all the @xmath20 sites in the lattice we introduce the cutoff @xmath21 which will allow us to monitor the behavior of the coupling as a function of the range of the _ e - ph _ correlations .",
    "note that in 1d , the integer @xmath19 numbers the neighbors shells up to @xmath21 while in 2d , the @xmath22 term includes the second neighbors shell , the sum up to @xmath23 includes the fifth neighbors shells , @xmath24 covers the nineth shell and so on . switching off the interatomic forces , @xmath25",
    ", one would recover from ( 4 ) a local _ e - ph _ coupling model with @xmath26 . as no approximation has been done at this stage eqs.(4 ) are general .",
    "taking into account first neighbors intermolecular forces in the holstein molecular crystal model , the optical phonon spectra are given in 1d and 2d respectively by @xcite :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the intra- and inter - molecular energies respectively .    treating in ( 4 ) the phonon coordinates as classical variables interacting with quantum mechanical fermion operators we assume a semiclassical version of the dispersive holstein hamiltonian .",
    "this is the main approximation in the model which will permit us to derive a time dependent source current for the general electron path integral . averaging ( 4 ) on the electronic ground state we also define the _ e - ph _ energy per lattice site    @xmath30    which will be used in the next section .",
    "while we are thus neglecting the quantum nature of the lattice vibrations , the latter may in itself lead to retardation effects in the ground state structure of the composite quasiparticle made of one electron plus phonon excitations in the adiabatic regime .",
    "moreover , at finite temperatures , the quantum lattice fluctuations are expected to influence the thermodynamics of the system mainly for intermediate values of the e - ph coupling @xcite .",
    "let s apply to the holstein hamiltonian space - time mapping techniques @xcite which allow us to write the general path integral for one electron particle in a bath of dispersive phonons .",
    "thus we introduce @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the electron coordinates at the @xmath33 and @xmath34 lattice sites respectively , and @xmath35 in ( 1 ) transforms into    @xmath36    @xmath37 and @xmath38 are continuous variables @xmath39\\bigr)$ ] in the matsubara green s functions formalism with @xmath40 being the inverse temperature hence the electron hops are not constrained to first neighbors sites .",
    "accordingly , eq.(7 ) is more general than @xmath35 in ( 1 ) . after setting @xmath41 , @xmath42 , we take the thermal averages for the electron operators over the ground state of the hamiltonian thus obtaining in @xmath43 dimensions the average energy per lattice site due to electron hopping :    @xmath44 + g[{\\bf x}(\\tau ) , \\tau ] \\bigr ) \\,\\nonumber \\\\ & & g[{\\bf x}(\\tau ) , \\tau]=\\,{1 \\over { \\beta } } \\int { { d{\\bf k}}\\over { \\pi}^d } exp[i{\\bf k \\cdot x}(\\tau)]\\sum_n { { exp(-i\\hbar\\nu_n \\tau ) } \\over { i\\hbar\\nu_n - \\epsilon_{\\bf k } } } \\,\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath45 are the fermionic matsubara frequencies and @xmath46 is the electron dispersion relation .",
    "the spatial _ e - ph _ correlations contained in ( 3 ) are mapped onto the time axis introducing the @xmath37 dependence in the displacement field : @xmath47 . assuming periodic atomic particle paths : @xmath48 we can expand @xmath49 in @xmath50 fourier components :    @xmath51    with @xmath52 .",
    "then , on the base of eqs.(6 ) and ( 9 ) , we identify the perturbing source current of the holstein model with the @xmath37 dependent averaged _ e - ph _ hamiltonian term :    @xmath53    with these premises , we are now in the position to write the general path integral @xcite for an holstein electron in a bath of dispersive phonons . assuming a mixed representation , the electron paths are taken in real space while the phonon paths are in momentum space .",
    "the electron path integral reads :    @xmath54 \\,\\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\int d{\\bf x}(\\tau ) exp\\biggl[- \\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau \\biggl({m \\over 2 } \\dot{{\\bf x}}^2(\\tau ) + h^e(\\tau )",
    "- j_{\\bf q}(\\tau)\\biggr ) \\biggr ] \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the kinetic term ( @xmath55 is the electron mass ) is normalized by the functional measure of integration over the electron paths .    as a direct consequence of the time - local nature of the _ e - ph _ interactions ,",
    "the holstein source current does not depend on the electron path coordinates .",
    "then @xmath56 in ( 11 ) can be easily integrated over @xmath37 using eqs.(9),(10 ) and noticing that    @xmath57    we get :    @xmath58    @xmath59 is thus a time averaged _ e - ph _ potential .",
    "the total partition function can be derived from ( 11 ) by imposing the closure condition both on the phonons ( eq.(9 ) ) and on the electron paths , @xmath60 . using ( 13 ) , we obtain :    @xmath61 \\,\\times \\oint d{\\bf x}(\\tau ) exp\\biggl[- \\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau \\biggl({m \\over 2 } \\dot{{\\bf x}}^2(\\tau ) + h^e(\\tau ) \\biggr ) \\biggr ]   \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq.(14 ) shows that the averaged _ e - ph _ coupling is weighed only by the @xmath37-independent component @xmath62 of the displacement field .",
    "this property will prove to be essential in the next calculations .",
    "the integration over the phonon paths can be done analytically choosing a measure of integration which normalizes the kinetic term in the phonon field action :    @xmath63\\equiv 1   \\",
    ", \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    being @xmath64 . in the following calculations we set @xmath65 .    using the result @xcite :    @xmath66    we derive :    @xmath67 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the exponential function in @xmath68 embodies the effect of the non local correlations due to the dispersive nature of the phonon spectrum .",
    "phonon and electron contributions to the partition function are decoupled although the effective potential @xmath69 carries a dependence on the electron density profile in momentum space through the function @xmath70 .",
    "first we analyse the behavior of the time ( temperature ) averaged _ e - ph _ potential ( eq.(13 ) ) in the case of a linear chain and of a square lattice .",
    "note that @xmath49 in ( 9 ) is a real quantity consistently with the closure condition on the lattice displacement path .",
    "accordingly , from ( 6 ) ( and ( 10 ) ) , we take a real profile also for the electron distribution in momentum space . setting the total electron density on a single site and defining @xmath71 as the on site electron density , from ( 6 ) , we write the electron profile @xmath72 for the 1d system and @xmath73 for the 2d system . since the momentum integration runs over @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath71 represents in both cases the total electron density .",
    "this choice is convenient in order to normalize the averaged e - ph couplings over the same parameter both in 1d and 2d .",
    "physically it corresponds to pin one electron on a lattice site and to measure the effects on the potential due to the e - ph correlations with variable range .",
    "let s assume low energy phonon spectra parameters , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "setting @xmath77 , we take a strong bare holstein coupling @xmath11 although the general trend of our results holds for any value of @xmath11 . in fig.1(a ) , @xmath78 is plotted for three choices of the cutoff @xmath21 ( see eqs.(4 ) ) to emphasize the dependence of the potential on the _ e - ph _ interaction range .",
    "the constant value of the potential obtained for @xmath79 is also reported on .",
    "while in the case of short correlations ( @xmath80 ) there is a range of wave vectors in which the effective coupling becomes larger than the dispersionless coupling , long range _",
    "e - ph _ correlations substantially reduce the effective potential with respect to the dispersionless case and set in an oscillating behavior which makes the renormalization q - dependent .",
    "the potential tends to converge for the value @xmath81 which corresponds to 48 lattice sites along the chain .",
    "the projections of the two dimensional _ e - ph _ potential along the @xmath82 component of the wave vector is reported on in fig.1(b ) for three values of the cutoff on the correlation range .",
    "for @xmath83 the correlation range is extended to the second neighbor shell thus including 8 lattice sites . for @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "we normalize over 24 and 48 lattice sites respectively .",
    "then , the three values of @xmath21 in 2d span as many lattice sites as the three values of @xmath21 in 1d respectively .",
    "this choice permits to normalize consistently the potential for the linear chain and the square lattice .",
    "there is a strong renormalization for the 2d effective potential with respect to the dispersionless case for any value of the wave vector . by extending the correlation range",
    "this tendency becomes more pronounced for @xmath86 close to the center and to the edge of the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "an analogous behavior is found by projecting the 2d potential along the @xmath87 axis .",
    "the 2d potential stabilizes by including the @xmath88 neighbor shell ( @xmath85 ) in the correlation range .",
    "then , an increased range for the _ e - ph _ correlations leads to an effect which is qualitatively analogous to that one would get by hardening the phonon spectrum : a reduction of the effective coupling and the consequent lightening of the quasiparticle effective mass @xcite .",
    "let s see now to which extent the momentum dependent potential affects the thermodynamics of the system . in the total partition function ( eq.(14 ) )",
    "the electronic and phononic paths have been integrated out separately as the source current does not depend on the electronic coordinates .",
    "the * q*-phonon contribution to the partition function is thus given by @xmath68 in ( 17 ) hence , the free energy due to the * q*-mode is :    @xmath89    where the first two terms represent the harmonic free energy @xmath90 . since @xmath91 $ ] we find a constraint which allows us to determine the cutoff @xmath92 . for the 1d system , at @xmath93 and for the phonon parameters given above",
    ", we get @xmath94 with @xmath95 varying in the range @xmath96 $ ] according to the @xmath97-mode .",
    "the _ e - ph _ interactions renormalize downwards the harmonic values for any * q * as @xmath98 but the temperature derivatives of the free energy do not involve the coupling term . then , on general grounds , phonon entropy and heat capacity are not affected by the strength of the _ e - ph _ interaction and signatures of _ e - ph _",
    "anharmonicity should not be expected in the equilibrium properties of the phonon subsystem .",
    "this is a direct macroscopic effect of the local nature of the interactions in the holstein model . on the other hand lattice",
    "non linearities may appear in the ground state properties of the holstein hamiltonian and significantly modify the dynamical properties of the polaronic quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "in fig.2 , we consider the linear chain with the cutoff @xmath81 of fig.1(a ) and set @xmath99 .",
    "the phonon free energies are plotted for two selected wave vectors together with the corresponding harmonic values .",
    "it is seen that the renormalization of the @xmath97-dependent free energies due to the _ e - ph _ coupling is very weak . however , being @xmath100 , the phonon free energy reduction may be appreciable in very low energy phonon spectra provided that the bare coupling @xmath11 is sufficiently strong .",
    "next we turn to the evaluation of the electronic contribution to the total partition function ( eq.(17 ) ) .",
    "the results hereafter presented refer to the case of 1d electronic paths .",
    "as the hopping energy density is related to the electron propagator ( eq.(8 ) ) a preliminar wave vector integration prepares @xmath101 as a function of the path coordinates .",
    "then , the @xmath102 integration has to be done numerically . assuming the periodicity condition @xmath103",
    ", the particle paths can be expanded in @xmath104 fourier components    @xmath105    so that the functional measure of integration    @xmath106    normalizes the free electron term in ( 17 ) :    @xmath107 = \\,1\\ ] ]    eq.(21 ) provides a criterion to set the cutoff @xmath108 which turns out to be @xmath109 thus implying that the maximum amplitude of the particle path coefficients becomes large in the low temperature range .",
    "this is consistent with the physical expectation that towards high temperatures only a reduced number of paths contributes to the action which thus tends to the classical limit .",
    "accordingly , the integration over each fourier component in ( 20 ) is carried out over a number of points @xmath110 and the electron hopping in the path integral ( 18 ) is weighed over a total number of electron paths @xmath111 .",
    "we find that @xmath112 and @xmath113 suffice to ensure numerical convergence .",
    "while the free electron term only scarcely contributes to the electronic action , the hopping dependent action is dominant also at low temperatures .",
    "infact , according to our measure of integration , the ensemble of relevant particle paths ( over which the hopping energy density is evaluated ) is @xmath0 dependent .",
    "however , given a single set of path parameters one can monitor the @xmath101 behavior versus @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that the hopping decreases by decreasing @xmath0 but its value remains appreciable also at low temperatures .",
    "since the @xmath114 integration range is larger at lower temperatures , the overall hopping contribution to the total action is relevant also at low @xmath0 .",
    "the equilibrium thermodynamics of the holstein model can be derived from ( 17 ) .",
    "we average the phonon contribution over a set of 50 modes in the 1d brillouin zone and take the bare _ e - ph _ coupling @xmath77 . phonon and",
    "electron free energies are plotted separately versus temperature in fig.3(a ) .",
    "note that in the low @xmath0 range the electron free energy has a positive derivative both for narrow and wide band values although the range shrinks by increasing the hopping integral value .",
    "for @xmath115 , the electron free energy gets the maximum at @xmath116 while for @xmath117 , the maximum occurs at @xmath118 .",
    "this feature is mirrored in the total heat capacity which is reported on in fig.3(b ) for four @xmath7 values together with the phonon heat capacity normalized over the number of modes .",
    "as noted above the latter overlaps the purely harmonic heat capacity no matter how large the _ e - ph _ coupling may be .",
    "thus the holstein phonon heat capacity does not contain signatures of _ e - ph _ anharmonicity . the total heat capacity over @xmath0 ratio shows an upturn at low temperatures as shown in fig.3(c ) due to the electron hopping mechanism which has already been encountered in the study of the ssh model @xcite .",
    "however , while in the latter the shape of the low @xmath0 upturn could be tuned by the strength of the _ e - ph _ coupling in the source action , in the holstein model the low @xmath0 anomaly has purely electronic origins as the _ e - ph _ effects are contained in the phonon partition function .",
    "this also explains why the absolute values of the holstein heat capacity are much lower than the ssh heat capacity throughout the whole temperature range .",
    "in the holstein model , the _ e - ph _ coupling is local and the vertex function does not depend on the wave vectors .",
    "nonetheless non local _ e - ph _ correlations arise in the system once the dispersive nature of the phonon spectrum is taken into account .",
    "i have studied a semiclassical version of the one electron holstein hamiltonian in which quantum mechanical fermion operators interact with classical lattice displacements .",
    "applying the path integral method the real space interactions can be mapped onto the time scale and , in the matsubara formalism , we have derived an analytical expression for the time averaged wave vector dependent _ e - ph _ coupling . assuming a force constant intermolecular model we have evaluated the renormalization of the wave vector dependent _ e - ph _ coupling , both in one- and two - dimensions , as a function of the range of the _ e - ph _ correlations . in 1d , for short range correlations ( @xmath80 ) , i find an enhancement of the effective coupling with respect to the dispersionless coupling in a window of phonon wave vectors . by increasing @xmath21 , the effective coupling renormalizes downwards for any @xmath97 although the reduction is larger towards the edge of the brillouin zone . in 2d ,",
    "the renormalization is even more pronounced and takes place also for small values of the cutoff on the correlation range .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the _ e - ph _ correlations in the effective coupling has an effect which is similar to that one would obtain by enhancing the characteristic phonon frequency and it ultimately leads to reduce the effective mass of the quasiparticle .",
    "the holstein polaron mass in a dispersive phonon model is thus lighter than in a dispersionless model .",
    "mapping the _ e - ph _ interaction onto the time scale we also find that the perturbing source current of the model depends on the time only through the atomic displacement field , hence it is not retarded . then",
    ", the temperature ( time ) averaged current is proportional to the averaged atomic displacement and it does not include the electronic coordinates .",
    "this property allows us to decouple phonon and electron degrees of freedom in the general path integral and in the total partition function .",
    "such a disentanglement does not occur in the su - schrieffer - heeger model @xcite as the source current does depend on the electron path coordinates . as a physical consequence the renormalized holstein _ e - ph _ coupling is frozen in the phonon partition function while the electron action is dominated by the hopping energy density . after integrating out analytically the phonon degrees of freedom we have obtained the * q*-dependent phonon free energy and estimated the _ e - ph _ corrections ( with respect to the harmonic values ) in the thermodynamical properties .",
    "it turns out that the holstein heat capacity does not show any signature of phonon anharmonicity induced by the _",
    "e - ph _ interactions .",
    "this marks a striking difference with respect to the thermodynamical behavior of the previously investigated su - schrieffer - heeger model . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron hopping energy strongly contributes to the total action of the holstein model and , at low temperatures , it is responsible for a peculiar upturn in the _ heat capacity over temperature _ ( @xmath119 ) ratio .",
    "while qualitatively the latter feature had also been envisaged in the ssh heat capacity , in the holstein model the shape of the broad upturn has purely electronic origins and it is not affected by the _",
    "e - ph _ source action .",
    "this explains why @xmath119 has a negative temperature derivative throughout the whole @xmath0 range for any value of the hopping integral .",

    "<S> we derive the _ e - ph _ corrections to the phonon free energy and show that its temperature derivatives do not depend on the _ e - ph _ effective coupling hence , the holstein phonon heat capacity is strictly harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> a significant upturn in the low temperature total heat capacity over @xmath0 ratio is attributed to the electron hopping which largely contributes to the action .    </S>",
