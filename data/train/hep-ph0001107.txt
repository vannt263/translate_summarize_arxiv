    "the existence of glueball states made of gluons is one of the important predictions of qcd .",

    "however , without the confirmation that which state , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , is the isovector member in the ground @xmath12 nonet , the level order of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the scalar sector perhaps still remains open . on one hand , if the @xmath23 is assigned as the isovector member in the ground @xmath12 nonet , since the @xmath23 with mass @xmath26 mev@xcite has a higher mass than the observed isodoublet scalar states @xmath27 with mass @xmath28 mev@xcite , according to the gell - mann- okubo mass formula@xcite one would expect @xmath29 . on the other hand ,",
