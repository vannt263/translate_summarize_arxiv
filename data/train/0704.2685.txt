    "millimeter interferometric studies of the l1448 and hh211 class 0 sources have identified high - velocity sio jet - like emission possibly related to the primary protostellar wind @xcite .",
    "a similar sio jet has recently been discovered by codella et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter paper  i ) in the hh212 h@xmath0 outflow in orion ( @xmath10 450 pc ) using the new extended configuration of the pdbi . this study revealed highly collimated sio emission with a close spatial and kinematic correspondence to near - ir h@xmath0 knots , indicating that both are tracing the same molecular jet component .",
    "in addition , an inner pair of sio knots with no near - ir h@xmath0 counterparts was identified at @xmath111@xmath125 of the central source , with a radial velocity range pointing to a high degree of collimation .",
    "continuum data at 1 mm further reveal a compact , optically thick source probably tracing a disk of diameter @xmath13 120  au .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by lee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in a lower resolution , multi - species study with the submillimeter array ( sma ) .    in this second paper",
    ", we further exploit the unprecedented resolution of @xmath1 hpbw across the jet axis provided by the extended configuration of the pdbi to carry out the first comparison of the properties of the class 0 sio `` microjet '' in hh212 with atomic microjets from class i / ii sources observed on similar scales .",
    "we identify several similarities suggesting that the same collimation ( and possibly acceleration ) mechanism is at work in class 0 jets as in later stages .",
    "we also demonstrate that sio is optically thick and close to lte in the inner knots ( as is not generally assumed ) and discuss possible origins for the abundant sio in class 0 jets , compared to their more evolved counterparts .",
    "figure  1 presents pdbi sio 54 maps from paper i of the inner jet knots , separated into three velocity intervals .",
    "the sio microjet is _ extremely narrow _ , with a typical transverse fwhm @xmath14 @xmath15 at all velocities , i.e. an intrinsic width of @xmath16 = 90  au after correction for the pdbi hpbw of @xmath1 in the same direction was quoted in paper i , where cleaning had not been optimized for the innermost jet regions . ] .",
    "figure  1 also shows that , in both lobes , the region of blue / red overlap is not coincident with the region of highest radial velocities , but is slightly _ trailing behind it _ by about @xmath15 .",
    "the lack of blue / red contamination towards the fastest gas requires that its motions are highly forward - directed with a semi - opening angle @xmath17 ( see paper i ) .",
    "the blue / red overlap at low velocities @xmath14 3 - 4 km s@xmath18 traces less collimated , slower material in the wake of the fastest gas .",
    "the width of atomic jets from t tauri class ii sources spans a relatively broad range , depending on the brightness of bowshock wings driven by internal working surfaces . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the intrinsic fwhm of the hh212 sio microjet is compared to the broadest ( dg  tau ) and narrowest ( rw  aur ) atomic microjets from class ii sources studied so far using ground - based adaptive optics or hst @xcite .",
    "we find that the hh212 sio microjet falls exactly in the same range as class ii jets on scales 5001000 au .",
    "similar results are found for the sio jet from the hh211 class 0 source ( width of 95125  au at distances of 300600 au ; gueth et al .",
    "2007 ) .    also indicated in fig .",
    "2 is the width of the hh212 jet at 50 au from the source , @xmath14 40 mas = 18 au , as inferred from the bow shape of h@xmath0o maser spots within 100 mas @xcite .",
    "again it is undistinguishable from that of atomic microjets at the same distance .",
    "we thus find no evidence of a higher jet collimation in class 0 sources compared to the t tauri stage where only a thin disk is present , although the dense infalling envelopes characterizing the class 0 stage would be capable of strongly reconfining a radially expanding wind @xcite .",
    "this definitely rules out collimation by external pressure gradients and requires that jets from young stellar objects are self - collimated by internal magnetic stresses .",
    "the jet mhd collimation process appears to be the same at all phases , with all fast material confined within a beam diameter of about 15 - 20 au over a distance @xmath19 au .",
    "we further note that the hh212 class 0 microjet follows interesting scalings compared with class ii microjets concerning its energetics and kinematics .",
    "( i ) the mass ejection to accretion rate in hh212 estimated by lee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from co emission farther out along the jet is 15% ( scaling with @xmath20/100 km  s@xmath18 ) .",
    "this is similar to the ratio of 10% found for spatially resolved class ii jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "( ii ) the hh212 knot speed of 100 - 150 km  s@xmath18 is typically half that in t tauri jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for a four times lower stellar mass of 0.15m@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "hence the jet speed appears reduced in the same proportion as the escape speed from the central object .",
    "such scalings would be consistent with the jet acceleration mechanism and launching zone also possibly being the same at all phases .",
    "however , similar data in a larger sample of class 0 jets would be needed to confirm this conjecture .",
    "in order to constrain the physical conditions associated with the sio emission in the inner jet , we compared the @xmath22=21 and 54 line intensities from paper i. for proper comparison , the sio(54 ) map , originally obtained with a @xmath23 resolution , was reconstructed at the lower resolution of the sio(21 ) map ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "figure  3 plots on a main beam ( `` mb '' ) scale the reconstructed 54 line profiles at the peaks of the inner sio knots , and the ratio @xmath25 ( 54)/@xmath25 ( 21 ) as a function of velocity ( bottom panels ) . it can be seen that the ratio is @xmath14 0.751.1 across the blue knot profile , and @xmath14 0.50.85 across the red knot profile .",
    "relative calibration uncertainties between the 21 and 54 lines are estimated to be @xmath14 20% .",
    "we similarly evaluate the sio ( 87 ) to ( 54 ) intensity ratio by degrading our pdbi map to the @xmath26 sma beam of lee et al .",
    "the resulting ( 54 ) spectra towards the inner sio knots are also plotted in fig .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "10 of lee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) yields an ( 87)/(54 ) ratio in the range 0.71 at all velocities .",
    "the relative calibration uncertainty could reach 30% .",
    "a third constraint is provided by the peak main beam temperatures @xmath25(54 ) @xmath14 25  k in both knots in our original pdbi beam ( top curve in figure  3 ) . as the jet is broadened by a factor @xmath14 2 by beam convolution across the jet ( cf .",
    "2 ) , the intrinsic line temperature @xmath27(54 ) is at least 25@xmath282 = 50  k. including beam dilution along the jet axis with @xmath29 hpbw , the intrinsic line brightness could reach 200  k if the knot is roughly circular .",
    "the line ratios and ( 54 ) intrinsic brightness are compared with the result of a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) code , which considers the first 20 levels of sio and the rate coefficients for collisions with h@xmath0 reported by turner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) up to @xmath30 = 300  k. we explored h@xmath0 densities from @xmath31 to @xmath32 @xmath7 ( see sect .  3.3 ) and an lvg optical depth parameter @xmath33(sio)/ @xmath34 = @xmath35 ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath37 @xmath38 ( km  s@xmath18)@xmath18 , i.e. from the fully optically thin to optically thick regime .",
    "our typical model results are illustrated graphically for @xmath30 = 100  k in fig .  4 , and compared with observed values in hh212 .",
    "we find that the usual approach of assuming optically thin emission to derive @xmath39 and @xmath30 from line ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would give inaccurate results in our case : as shown in fig .",
    "4(bottom panel ) , no optically thin model ( starred symbols in the curves ) can _ simultaneously _ reproduce the observed values of both sio(87)/(54 ) and sio(54)/(21 ) .",
    "values @xmath14 1 for both ratios are only achieved when approaching the optically thick lte regime ( @xmath40 @xmath30 ) , which is the point of convergence of all density curves at sufficiently high opacity .",
    "we infer that @xmath35 must be greater than @xmath41 @xmath38 ( km  s@xmath18)@xmath18 , while @xmath39 is not well - constrained .",
    "the high ( 54 ) intrinsic brightness of 50  k-200  k also independently argues for a large optical depth parameter ( fig .  4 ,",
    "it also indicates that @xmath30 lies in the range 50 - 500 k , or else the predicted @xmath27(54 ) close to lte would be too low / high .",
    "we note that substantial sio optical depth could be rather common in the innermost part of class 0 jets , if they are as narrow as in hh212 . in the l1448 jet , for example ,",
    "a column density @xmath4210@xmath43 @xmath38 has been derived from single - dish measurements of the 54 transition assuming a jet width of 2@xmath44 @xcite",
    ". a narrower width of @xmath420.2@xmath44 would result in a column density higher by an order of magnitude , implying , as in hh212 , a line optical depth larger than unity .",
    "hence the low @xmath25(54 ) @xmath14 0.1 - 1  k in single - dish observations could result mainly from severe beam dilution of the sio emission , as argued previously by gibb et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and illustrated in fig .   3 .",
    "the sio abundances would then be substantially larger than previously reported .",
    "noting that @xmath35 = @xmath33(sio)/ @xmath34 , the sio abundance with respect to h@xmath0 may be written : the adopted line - of - sight velocity gradient @xmath45 is typical of cooled regions with @xmath30 @xmath13 100 k at the rear of planar c - shocks and is probably a lower limit .",
    "a steeper gradient @xmath45 is given by the ratio of the fwzi of the sio line profile ( @xmath14 10 km  s@xmath18 ) to the knot width ( @xmath16 = 100  au ) , which would increase x(sio ) by a factor 16 from the above formula .",
    "the main uncertainty in x(sio ) stems from the unknown h@xmath0 density in the sio knots .",
    "a reasonable range may be inferred from the presence of shock - excited h@xmath0o masers at 0.1@xmath44 from the source .",
    "magnetic field strengths and line ratios in h@xmath0o masers around ysos typically require preshock h nuclei densities @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath7 @xcite . assuming that density roughly drops with distance as @xmath48 ( cf the dg tau jet ; lavalley - fouquet et al .",
    "2000 ) , one infers a preshock density @xmath49 @xmath7 at the sio knots .",
    "shock compression could increase these values by a about an order or magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the density is in the range @xmath50 @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting _ minimum _ sio abundance for optically thick emission is x(sio ) @xmath51 , with the higher value corresponding to the lower density , and the additional factor 116 arising from the uncertainty in velocity gradient . assuming a solar abundance of ( si / h)@xmath21 @xmath52 @xcite ,",
    "between 0.05% and 90% of the elemental silicon is in the form of sio .",
    "our pdbi observations of the hh212 microjet set stronger constraints than previously on the origin of the sio in protostellar outflows , because of the shorter timescales involved and the unusually high collimation and sio column densities indicated by our data .",
    "given the proper motions of 60 - 150 km  s@xmath18 for h@xmath0o masers and h@xmath0 knots @xcite , the dynamical time of inner sio peaks at 500  au is only 25 yrs .",
    "sio should thus be incorporated very rapidly in the flow .",
    "the formation of sio in outflows is usually attributed to sputtering of si atoms from charged grains in a magnetized c - shock with ion - neutral drift speeds @xmath53 25 km  s@xmath18 @xcite . updated c - shock models with improved sputtering yields , sio formation rates , and molecular cooling ( gusdorf et al . , in preparation ) show that the required conditions for optically thick emission are reached for shock speeds 3545 km  s@xmath18 and preshock densities of @xmath54 @xmath7 but only at the rear of the shock where velocity gradients are small , i.e. after 400150 yrs .",
    "as this exceeds the knot dynamical time , non - steady truncated c - shocks need to be considered to model sio - emitting shocks on such small scales .",
    "another long - standing issue is whether sio molecules originate from shocked ambient material or trace the primary jet itself .",
    "the sio microjet diameter of 100 au is comparable to the centrifugal disk diameter of 120  au indicated by our 1 mm continuum size ( paper  i ) and by envelope kinematics @xcite .",
    "hence we would expect little infalling molecular material left on - axis to refill the jet path between successive ejection episodes , unless this material is very warm .",
    "this would appear to favor an origin of the sio in the jet itself .",
    "the option is appealing , as the higher densities of class 0 jets , and the accompanying low temperature and ionization , are indeed conducive to molecular formation . in an early study of chemistry in protostellar winds , glassgold et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found that si atoms are quickly converted into sio at high mass - loss rates @xmath55   @xmath56m@xmath21  yr@xmath18 . for a dust - free wind ,",
    "the predicted sio abundances are @xmath14 50 - 100% of the total elemental silicon .",
    "however , the recent finding of a substantial depletion of fe and ca at the base of several class i jets @xcite indicates that jets are not dust - free and that grains are only partly eroded along the flow . in the hh34 jet , 13% of fe",
    "has been returned to the gas at distances @xmath53 1500 au . the same process at work in class 0 jets would release si atoms in a sufficient amount to produce optically thick sio emission if @xmath55 @xmath57m@xmath21  yr@xmath18 . in the inner sio knots of hh212",
    ", this mass - flux is achieved for @xmath39 @xmath58@xmath7 ( with @xmath59 100 km  s@xmath18 and a jet radius of 50  au ) , thus only 0.5%9% of si would be needed , if all is converted into sio ( see eq .  1 ) .",
    "our finding that jet collimation in the hh212 class 0 source is similar to that in t tauri stars favors a collimation mechanism independent of the presence of a dense envelope , i.e. most probably internal mhd stresses .",
    "the ejection / accretion ratio and the jet speed / escape speed ratio also appear to be similar to those in class ii , possibly suggesting the same acceleration mechanism as well . the main difference between class 0 jets and their more evolved analogs",
    "would then be their differing chemical composition , with abundant molecules at the class 0 stage , a mixed atomic - molecular composition at the class i stage @xcite , and a purely atomic flow at the class ii stage .",
    "we also find that sio is optically thick , so that its abundance is larger than previously estimated .",
    "the extremely narrow width of the sio jet revealed by pdbi further argues that this species is not formed in swept - up material , but more likely within the jet itself .",
    "we thus propose that the higher sio content of class 0 jets could mainly reflect an increase in jet density ( hence , a higher efficiency of molecular formation ) , linked to the increased mass - accretion rate at earlier stages .",
