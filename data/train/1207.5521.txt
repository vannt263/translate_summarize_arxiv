    "the ( type - i ) seesaw mechanism  @xcite is arguably the simplest and best motivated framework not only to give neutrinos mass but also to explain the smallness of said masses compared to the electroweak scale .",
    "the necessary right - handed neutrino partners are assumed to be heavy to suppress the active neutrino masses , which also allows for baryogenesis through leptogenesis  @xcite via the decay of the heavy states , thus explaining the baryon asymmetry of the universe . while initially motivated in the context of grand unified theories ,",
    "the seesaw mechanism has since been applied in its own right . the number of right - handed neutrinos , transforming as singlets of the standard model ( sm ) gauge group , is then no longer constrained by anomaly cancellations or the need to fill up an irreducible representation , but rather a free parameter .",
    "at least two right - handed neutrinos are necessary to reproduce the observed neutrino mass - squared differences , as well as leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "there is however no upper bound , and models with @xmath2@xmath3 singlets have been studied in the context of leptogenesis  @xcite , lepton flavor violation ( lfv )  @xcite and as a way to explain the large mixing angles of the active neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "like for most things in life , there is also a motivation from string theory  @xcite .",
    "the number of singlets is formally infinite in extra - dimensional theories , as right - handed neutrinos are not restricted to the sm - brane and will thus lead to a tower of kaluza - klein excitations  @xcite .",
    "still lacking , however , is a proper parametrization of the arising mixing and coupling matrices in terms of physical quantities , as needed for example for efficient parameter scans ( as the number of redundant parameters explodes for large @xmath0 ) .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide exactly these parametrizations for arbitrary @xmath0 , both for the most general case ( top - down approach , to some degree discussed in ref .",

    "the parametrization of this ambiguity is the goal of the casas - ibarra - parametrization  @xcite of the yukawa coupling : @xmath90 this @xmath17 solves @xmath91 as long as the complex @xmath46 matrix @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 .",
    "correspondingly , any values of @xmath13 and @xmath92 in eq .",
    "lead to the same low - energy model , which means we can fix the pmns mixing angles and masses to the observed ones and study @xmath17 independently in other processes .",
    "we will now give an explicit parametrization of @xmath92 , which has @xmath94 complex entries obeying @xmath95 real constraints ( @xmath96 is symmetric ) ; we therefore expect to find @xmath97 real physical parameters .",
    "this agrees of course with the parameter counting in the last section , as we also have three charged lepton masses , three light neutrino masses , @xmath0 heavy neutrino masses and six parameters in the pmns matrix , summing up to @xmath88 input parameters .",
    "since we only need three orthonormal complex vectors @xmath98 to define @xmath92 , we can write @xmath99 with a complex orthogonal @xmath14 matrix @xmath100 .",
    "similar to the @xmath74 parametrization used for @xmath54 in the previous section , we can write @xmath101 as a product of the @xmath102 matrices from eq .  , but with the arguments @xmath103 and @xmath104 in order for @xmath101 to be complex orthogonal : @xmath105 here , @xmath106 is a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath107 , which decides the determinant of @xmath101 and therefore whether it describes a rotation or a reflection .",
    "we can once again mod out the @xmath108 subgroup that acts on the zeros in @xmath109 by reordering the rotations , so the product in eq .",

    "one can therefore take any complete parametrization for @xmath114 without having to worry about unphysical parameters .",
    "for complex angles , @xmath101 and therefore @xmath92 and @xmath17 can have arbitrarily large elements , because the entries @xmath115 grow exponentially with @xmath116 . as a result ,",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath17 can be very large even for small @xmath13 , which is somewhat counterintuitive to the seesaw formula and relies on cancellations in the matrix product @xmath117 .",
    "even though these cancellations suggest finetuning of parameters , this is a viable possibility and deserves discussion , especially because a low @xmath13 with large yukawa couplings makes an lhc discovery ( direct or indirect ) possible  @xcite .",
    "popular models to obtain this finetuning in a natural way are for example inverse  @xcite and linear seesaw  @xcite , usually based on the case @xmath118 with an imposed structure in @xmath13 and @xmath17 by some symmetry .",
    "a useful constraint on the complex mixing angles @xmath111 comes from the perturbativity of @xmath17 , on which many calculations involving @xmath17 rely . for this",
    ", we propose yet another , slightly different parametrization of @xmath92 , which we obtain by noting that @xmath119 , and that the ordering of the @xmath70 is arbitrary : @xmath120 the @xmath97 parameters that make up @xmath92 are thus equally divided among the new real parameters @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the product involving @xmath121 is just an orthogonal matrix , so we can restrict @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",

    "the neutrino states @xmath134 that couple to the charged current are approximately given by  @xcite @xmath135 , with the mass eigenstates @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "the remaining contributions are naively of order @xmath145 , but can be enhanced via @xmath92 . in the approximation @xmath146 we have @xmath147 , so eq .   simplifies to @xmath148 since this branching ratio can easily exceed the current limit @xmath149",

    "note that this constraint is connected to the unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix  @xcite , because the relevant matrix @xmath151 is no longer unitary at this order .",
    "consequently , the above bound also ensures the validity of our parametrization for @xmath17 from eq .",

    "an analysis without this factor shows that the behavior of @xmath185 goes in the opposite direction , i.e.  the maximum shifts toward small values for large @xmath0 while being diluted .",

    "while the one data point nature provides can obviously not be used to find the overlying distribution , it should be fair to say that anarchy works best for small @xmath0 .",
    "let us finally comment on the limit @xmath190 .",
    "as the yukawa couplings @xmath48 become quasi - degenerate for very large @xmath0 , the neutrino masses are simply given by the upper left @xmath52 submatrix of @xmath188 ( times a prefactor ) . since there is no preferred direction in the @xmath54 rotations , the entries @xmath191 have the same mean magnitude for a given @xmath0 .",
    "the mean entries @xmath192 then take the form of a random walk with decreasing step - size @xmath193 , and due to the hierarchy in the singlet masses @xmath161 , only the first couple of steps are relevant .",
    "the mean magnitudes are again the same for all entries , so the only structure in the neutrino mass matrix comes from random phases @xmath194 : @xmath195 .",
    "so , if the number @xmath0 is high enough , anarchy eventually leads to democracy .",
    "it is easy to show that a matrix of this type predominantly yields nh solutions , so even though ih becomes more and more probable for large @xmath0 , it will never dominate .",

    ", it is interesting to study implications of varying @xmath0 .",
    "we have given explicit parametrizations for the mixing and coupling matrices connecting the @xmath0 right - handed neutrinos to the sm in terms of physical parameters , both in the top - down and the bottom - up approach ( casas - ibarra - parametrization ) .",
    "for the latter , constraints on the involved parameters from perturbativity of the yukawa couplings as well as charged lepton flavor violation have been discussed .    as a novel application of the @xmath0 singlet framework we studied basis independence in the neutrino sector , i.e.  anarchy . of the low - energy neutrino parameters , only the neutrino mass distribution changes with @xmath0 , and we showed that anarchy  with the simplest linear measure  seems to prefer small @xmath0 in view of the observed mass - squared differences .",
