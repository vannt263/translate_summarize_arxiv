    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the sky ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) using a dedicated wide - field 2.5 m telescope ( gunn et al .  2005 ) at apache point observatory , new mexico .",
    "imaging is carried out in drift - scan mode using a 142 mega - pixel camera ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) which gathers data in five broad bands , @xmath1 , spanning the range from 3000 to 10,000   ( fukugita et al .  1996 ) , on moonless photometric ( hogg et al .  2001 ) nights of good seeing .",
    "the images are processed using specialized software ( lupton et al.2001 ; lupton 2005 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , and are astrometrically ( pier et al .  2003 ) and photometrically ( tucker et al .",
    "2005 ) calibrated using observations of a set of primary standard stars ( smith et al .  2002 ) on a neighboring 20-inch telescope .",
    "the photometric calibration is accurate to roughly 2% rms in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands , and 3% in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as determined by the constancy of stellar population colors ( ivezi et al .",
    "2004b ; blanton et al .",
    "2005a ) , while the astrometric calibration precision is better than 0.1 arcsec rms per coordinate ( pier et al .",
    "the median seeing of the imaging data is 1.4 arcsec in the @xmath6 band , and the 95% completeness limit in the @xmath6 band is 22.2 .",
    "all magnitudes are roughly on an ab system ( abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) , and use the asinh scale described by lupton , gunn , & szalay ( 1999 ) .",
    "objects are selected from the imaging data for spectroscopy using a variety of algorithms , including a complete sample of galaxies with reddening - corrected ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ; sfd ) petrosian ( 1976 ) @xmath6 magnitudes brighter than 17.77 ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) , a deeper sample of color- and magnitude - selected galaxies targeting luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) from redshift 0.15 to beyond 0.5 ( eisenstein et al . 2001 ) , a color - selected sample of quasars with @xmath7 ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) , optical counterparts to rosat x - ray sources ( anderson et al .  2003 ) , and a variety of stellar and calibrating objects ( stoughton et al .",
    "these targets are arranged on a series of tiles of radius @xmath8 ( blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) , each containing 640 targets and calibration objects , and holes are drilled in the corresponding positions in aluminum plates .",
    "optical fibers with diameter @xmath9 at the focal plane are plugged into these holes , and feed the light of the targeted objects to a pair of double spectrographs .",
    "the resulting spectra cover the wavelength range @xmath10   with a resolution of @xmath11",
    ". the spectra are flux - calibrated using f subdwarfs , with a broad - band uncertainty of 5% ( abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) ; the wavelength calibration uncertainty is roughly 0.05  .",
    "more than 98% of all spectra are of high enough quality to yield an unambiguous classification and redshift .",
    "the sdss began formal operations in april 2000 .",
    "commissioning data taken before that time were released in an early data release ( edr ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , and subsequent data have been released in roughly yearly intervals ( the first , second , and third data releases , dr1 , dr2 , and dr3 ; abazajian et al .  2003 , 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "this paper describes the fourth data release , hereafter dr4 , consisting of survey data meeting our quality specifications taken through june 2004 .",
    "data releases are cumulative ; dr4 includes all data released in previous data releases .",
    "there have been no substantive changes to the imaging or spectroscopic software since dr2 .",
    "finkbeiner et al .",
    "( 2004 ) describe the release of sdss imaging data taken outside the formal sdss footprint ( as described by york et al . 2000 ) ; most of these data are at low galactic latitudes .",
    "in addition , there has been a number of value - added catalogs of sdss data , including galaxies ( blanton et al .",
    "2005a ) , quasars ( schneider et al .",
    "2005 ) , clusters of galaxies ( miller et al .",
    "2005 ) , compact groups ( lee et al .",
    "2004 ) , merging galaxies ( allam et al .",
    "2004 ) , white dwarf stars ( kleinman et al .  2004 ) , and asteroids ( ivezi et al .",
    "2004a ) .",
    "section  [ sec : dr4 ] of this paper describes the fourth data release itself .",
    "this release includes spectra from 209 plates principally in the southern galactic cap which explore a variety of extensions of the main spectroscopic targeting algorithms ; these are described in   [ sec : southern ] .",
    "additional new features of dr4 can be found in   [ sec : new ] .",
    "section  [ sec : caveats ] describes a recently discovered subtle effect in the sdss data , whereby mis - estimated sky levels near bright galaxies systematically bias the counts of neighboring faint galaxies .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as is described by york et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the sdss imaging data are taken along a series of stripes , great circles on the sky which aim to fill a contiguous area in the northern galactic cap , and three non - contiguous stripes in the southern galactic cap .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : skydist ] shows the region of sky included in dr4 . as this figure shows ,",
    "the northern galactic cap is currently covered by two contiguous regions , one centered roughly on the celestial equator , and the other at around @xmath12 .",
    "new data taken since dr3 ( indicated in grey in the figure ) have reduced the size of the gap between these regions ; these new data lie on the northern edge of the equatorial patch or on the southern edge of the northern patch .",
    "the images cover 6670 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the great circle stripes overlap at the poles of the survey ; roughly 25% of the region is covered more than once ; the repeat data in the northern galactic cap are available in dr4 as well .",
    "these data are processed by the same version of the imaging pipelines used in dr2 and dr3 .",
    "there have been concerns in previous data releases that the sdss imaging flat - fields change with time , especially in @xmath4 .",
    "we have confirmed that the flat fields used for the data taken since dr3 are correct to 2% or better .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : skydist ] shows the sky coverage of the spectroscopic data .",
    "as the spectroscopy necessarily lags the imaging , it covers less area , a total of 4783 deg@xmath0 .",
    "calculation of this area is more accurate than in previous data releases ( indeed abazajian et al .",
    "( 2003 ) erroneously indicated the spectroscopic area of dr3 to be 4188 deg@xmath0 ; the correct value for dr3 is 3732 deg@xmath0 ) . the sdss catalog archive server ( cas ) database includes a package that computes the spherical polygons corresponding to all geometric objects in the survey , defined by the boundaries of the imaging runs and the spectroscopic plates ( gray et al .",
    "2004 ; see also the discussion by blanton et al .",
    "given plate overlaps , one can divide up the spectroscopically tiled sky into non - overlapping `` sectors '' , each one of which defines a region uniformly covered by the same tiles . summing the area of those sectors which cover an observed spectroscopic plate",
    "gives the total area of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the spectroscopic data include 673,280 spectra , arrayed on 1052 plates of 640 fibers each .",
    "thirty - two fibers per plate are devoted to measurements of sky .",
    "there are approximately 480,000 galaxies , 64,000 quasars , and 89,000 stars among the spectra ; only 1% of the spectra are unclassified .",
    "about 2% of the objects are repeated on adjacent plates , as a check of the reproducibility of the spectroscopy .",
    "a number of spectroscopic plates have been observed more than once ; this data release includes those duplicate observations which satisfy our signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) criteria .",
    "these criteria are a mean s / n per pixel of 4 for objects with @xmath13 in the blue cameras of the spectrographs , and similarly for @xmath14 in the red cameras",
    ". in particular , there are 52 plates with more than one observation which are released .",
    "the majority of these plates have only one duplicate observation , but three plates ( 406 , 419 , and 483 ) have two duplicates , and two plates ( 406 and 412 ) have four .",
    "note that in most cases , the plates were replugged before being re - observed , so the correspondence between fiber number and object will be different on each observation .",
    "these duplicate plates are useful for monitoring the robustness of specific spectroscopic features , especially in low s / n spectra ( e.g. , hall et al .",
    "2004 ) , increasing the s / n of spectra by co - adding , and checking for variability ( wilhite et al .",
    "2005 , although note that this paper used many spectroscopic observations that fall below our s / n cut , and are therefore not included in the release ) .    in the fall months ,",
    "when the southern galactic cap is visible in the northern hemisphere , the sdss imaging has been confined to a stripe along the celestial equator , plus two `` outrigger '' stripes , centered roughly at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ( these are visible on the right - hand - side of the panels of figure  [ fig : skydist ] ) .",
    "we have performed multiple imaging passes of the equatorial stripe , data which are being used for a deep co - addition , as well as a variety of variability studies ( e.g. , ivezi et al .",
    "these multiple imaging scans are planned for inclusion in a future release .",
    "given the relatively small footprint of the imaging in the southern galactic cap , we finished the spectroscopy of targets selected by our normal algorithms quite early in the survey ; most of these data were included already in dr1 .",
    "we carry out imaging only under pristine conditions : the moon is below the horizon , the sky is cloudless , and the seeing is good . to make optimal use of the remaining time , we undertook a series of spectroscopic observing programs , based mostly on the imaging data of the equatorial stripe in the southern galactic cap , designed to go beyond the science goals of the main survey .",
    "dr4 includes 206 plates , totaling 131,840 spectra , from these programs , carried out in the fall months of 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 .",
    "these programs are described in the next section .",
    "in addition , dr4 includes nine plates which are repeat observations of these `` southern '' plates .",
    "the sky distribution of both the special and repeat plates are given in figure  [ fig : skydist_special ] .    as described by stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , these data are available both as flat files ( the data archive server ) , and via a flexible web interface to the sdss data base ( the cas ) .",
    "unlike the spectroscopic plates for the main survey , the special southern plates did not aim to produce a complete , uniform survey of targets over the entire survey area .",
    "indeed , many of the programs carried out with these plates were quite exploratory in nature , designed to probe the limits of the main survey target algorithms , push deeper in various categories of targets , or select classes of objects not fully explored by the main algorithms ( especially stars ) .",
    "these selection algorithms changed several times in the course of the 2001 - 2003 time period , which makes keeping track of the target selection flags somewhat complicated .",
    "table  [ table : southern_plates ] shows which algorithms ( as described below ) are used on which spectroscopic plates .",
    "this table makes reference to a _ chunk _ , i.e. , a region of imaging",
    "data on which target selection was run and spectroscopic tiles defined ( blanton et al .",
    "the different chunks are numbered , but are also given names ( e.g. , lowz97 ) , which can be useful in queries of the cas . while some chunks include only a few plates , others include several tens of plates . among the most important of these are the various merged programs .",
    "chunk 22 , the first of the major southern programs , used simple extensions of the main survey targeting algorithms ( although the plates included some objects targeted with the original algorithms as well ) . chunks 48 and 73 combined a variety of algorithms to target a range of different targets .",
    "chunks 45 , 52 , 62 , 74 and 97 used double - length exposures to target faint galaxies and stars .    as described by stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the survey marks each object targeted for spectroscopy with flag bits encoded in the primtarget and sectarget quantities .",
    "the relevant flag hex bits for the southern plates are given in table  [ table : southern_flags ] .",
    "with a few exceptions , these special plates are flagged with the highest bit in sectarget .",
    "the primtarget flags unfortunately can take on different meanings depending on chunk . thus using these target flags",
    "requires taking the chunk number or plate numbers into account .",
    "table  [ table : southern_flags ] also indicates the total number of objects with each of the target flags .",
    "all of the programs described below put a bright limit of 15 in @xmath17 , @xmath6 , and/or @xmath3 fiber magnitudes ( i.e. , aperture magnitudes of @xmath18 diameter , corresponding to the entrance aperture of the spectroscopic fibers ) , to prevent saturation and excessive crosstalk in the spectrographs .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , the magnitudes used below are point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes for stellar and quasar work , and are petrosian ( 1976 ) magnitudes for galaxy targets .",
    "similarly , for galaxies , colors are based on fits to exponential or de vaucouleurs profiles convolved with the psf ( stoughton et al.2000 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ; we refer to these as model colors in what follows ) .",
    "all magnitudes and colors have been corrected for sfd galactic extinction . with a few exceptions , objects for which spectroscopy already existed from previous spectroscopic observations",
    "were excluded as targets .",
    "this means that defining complete samples requires combining objects from more than one selection criterion .",
    "many of the southern plate selection algorithms were designed to select stars of various types , mostly for kinematic studies of the galactic halo and disks .",
    "* f stars : * f stars are numerous in the galaxy , have sharp spectral features allowing accurate radial velocities to be measured , are approximate standard candles if the stars are on the main sequence , and are of high enough luminosity that they can be seen to great distances .",
    "this program aims to use f star radial velocities to understand the kinematics of the outer parts of the milky way .",
    "most of these plates are in the southern galactic cap equatorial stripe ( chunks fstar29 and fstar51 ) , but there are also three plates in the vicinity of m31 ( fstar72 ) , and another two plates centered roughly on the perseus cluster ( seguetest84 ) .",
    "the m31 ( e.g. , zucker et al .",
    "2004ab ) and perseus imaging data are _ not _ included in dr4 , but will be included in a future data release .",
    "a program to target quasars in the plates near m31 is described in   [ sec : other ] ; similarly , see   [ sec : lowz_gal ] for a program to target galaxies in the perseus plates .    for the f - star program ,",
    "stellar objects with @xmath19 and with @xmath20 were selected . given the faint magnitudes of these stars and the desire for accurate radial velocities , these plates were observed to a s / n per pixel of 5 for stars with @xmath21 , requiring roughly twice the usual spectroscopic exposure of 45 minutes .    * main sequence turnoff : * this program was designed to study the kinematics and metallicities of high - latitude thick disk and halo stars .",
    "stars were selected in two sdss spectroscopic tiles , one centered at @xmath22 and the other at @xmath23 . in both tiles stars",
    "were selected to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the tile at @xmath26 is shared with the thick / thin disk program described below , and there is an additional cut at @xmath27 to avoid overlap .",
    "the data from this program that appear in dr4 are a randomly - selected subset of the total number of available targets in both tiles .",
    "the exposure time for this program was the standard spectroscopic exposure time for the main survey .",
    "* thick / thin disk stars : * a third program was focused on the kinematics of the thin and thick disks , targeting a complete sample of bright ( @xmath28 ) , red ( @xmath27 ) late - type stars in three adjacent spectroscopic tiles centered at high galactic latitude ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "it provides an in situ sample of thin and thick disk stars with radial velocities , proper motions , and spectroscopic metallicity determinations , densely sampling a single line of sight out to 2 kpc above the galactic plane . * segue test plates : * segue ( `` sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration '' ; newberg et al .",
    "2003 ) is part of a follow - on project to the sdss , emphasizing spectra of stars to study stellar populations and galactic structure .",
    "the targets on the segue test plates in dr4 are galactic stars of a variety of colors and magnitudes , meant to sample the range of available spectral types and to test the reproducibility of radial velocity measurements at faint magnitudes .",
    "segue aims to probe the structure of the milky way by sampling horizontal branch , f turnoff , g dwarf and k dwarf and giant stars , representing a variety of distances in the disk and halo .",
    "these plates are being used to refine target selection for the segue program itself , and will be described in detail in a future paper .",
    "* spectra of everything : * as part of an exploration of the full stellar locus , as well as a search for unusual objects of all sorts , we carried out a survey of all point sources .",
    "these objects were assigned to available spectroscopic fibers on the so - called merged program plates , which included a mixture of mostly extragalactic targets . in 2002",
    "( chunk 48 ) , this included a random sampling of all point sources with clean photometry ( see the discussion of fatal and non - fatal flags by richards et al . 2002 ) with sfd - corrected @xmath3-band psf magnitudes brighter than 19.1 .",
    "not surprisingly , the vast majority of the targets were chosen from the densest core of the stellar locus in color - color space .    in chunk 73",
    ", we revised the algorithm to put greater weight on the wings of the stellar locus .",
    "we defined a distance from the ridge of the stellar locus , by asking for the median and standard deviation @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 of stars in narrow bins of @xmath34 .",
    "having tabulated these , we calculated a crude @xmath35-like quantity : @xmath36 75% of all stars had @xmath37 .",
    "we sparsely sampled the objects with @xmath38 ; decreasing the sampling rate for smaller @xmath39 .",
    "as table  [ table : southern_flags ] describes , @xmath40 and @xmath38 objects are given different flags .",
    "these spectra were used for a determination of the completeness of the quasar target selection algorithm ( vanden berk et al .",
    "the overwhelming majority of these objects are confirmed to be stars ; only 10 of the 19,543 of the spectra of everything targets analyzed in that paper are quasars not previously targeted as such .    * high proper motion : * munn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) matched usno - b astrometric data ( monet et al.2003 ) with sdss to determine proper motions of stars (   [ sec : new ] ) .",
    "we targeted for spectroscopy stars with high proper motion along the equatorial stripe in the south galactic cap .",
    "the stars selected had @xmath41 , and two cuts were made on proper motion .",
    "the first was a simple cut of proper motion @xmath42 mas per year .",
    "the second used a cut in reduced proper motion @xmath43 , as follows . define @xmath43 as : @xmath44 the sample",
    "was defined by : @xmath45 this cut removes the majority of main sequence red dwarfs , which would otherwise swamp the sample .",
    "this sample is useful for studying the kinematics and spectral properties of very nearby objects , especially white dwarfs and objects near the end of the main sequence . despite the two cuts to define the sample , these are marked with a single target selection flag .",
    "* stellar locus:*for plates 323 and 324 , stellar targets were chosen from sdss imaging data , randomly sampling the stellar locus in color space , in order to explore the full range of stellar spectra .",
    "in particular , grids of width 0.04 magnitude in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 color planes were set down , and a single star at each grid point was chosen , if the grid had any stars at all .",
    "this process was repeated until each plate had 600 targets assigned .",
    "these objects have the target flag star_bhb set .      *",
    "main extension : galaxies * in chunk 22 , observed in fall 2001 , we used direct extensions of the main survey target selection algorithms . in particular , the main galaxy sample ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) was modified only slightly , by removing the cut on objects with half - light petrosian @xmath6 band surface brightness @xmath48 below 24.5 mag / arcsec@xmath0 .",
    "this adds less than one object per square degree .    for lrgs ,",
    "the sample was changed to probe galaxies fainter and bluer than those of the main survey selection described by eisenstein et al .",
    "in particular , the cuts that were used garner about 40 objects / deg@xmath0 : @xmath49 for cut i , and @xmath50 for cut ii . here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , equation  ( [ eq : cut1 ] ) pushes the cut i selection 0.3 magnitudes fainter , while equation  ( [ eq : cut2 ] ) significantly loosens the primary color cut of cut ii , to more fully explore the transition between cut i and cut ii .",
    "note that these plates also include an extension to the quasar target selection algorithm (   [ sec : other ] ) .    * complete main galaxies : * the main galaxy sample , as described by strauss et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is as complete as we can make it .",
    "however , the subset for which we actually obtain a spectrum is only about 90% .",
    "this incompleteness has several causes , including the fact that two spectroscopic fibers can not be placed closer than @xmath53 on a given plate , possible gaps between the plates , fibers that fall out of their holes , and so on .",
    "this program aims to observe the remaining 10% of galaxy targets in order to have a region of sky with truly complete galaxy spectroscopic coverage .",
    "this is particularly important for studies of galaxy pairs , which are by definition strongly affected by the @xmath53 rule .",

    "2001 ) obtains spectra for red faint ( @xmath41 ) galaxies ; photometric redshifts of this relatively uniform population ( e.g. , eisenstein et al .",
    "2003 ) are fairly robust ( e.g. , padmanabhan et al .",
    "however , we do not have a corresponding sample of faint blue galaxies for the calibration of photometric redshifts .",
    "therefore , a series of spectroscopic plates was designed to obtain redshifts for the blue end of the galaxy color distribution at the faint end .",
    "galaxies were selected using the following cuts , designed to select objects with photometric redshift greater than 0.3 ( csabai et al .",
    "2003 ) :    @xmath79    for objects that satisfied the above cuts , the quantity @xmath80 $ ] was calculated ; if it was larger than a random number chosen between zero and one , the object was targeted for spectroscopy .",
    "the coefficient @xmath81 was chosen to obtain an appropriate density of targets .",
    "note that plates 672 and 809 have the same center , and some objects were inadvertently observed twice .      * deep lrg exposures : * the sdss lrg sample ( eisenstein et al .  2001 ) targets",

    "as part of southern targeting , we have extended this algorithm in several ways .",
    "the first , the deep lrg sample , uses double - length spectroscopic exposures to get higher s / n spectra of lrgs with @xmath83 . combining with previous spectroscopy therefore gives a total exposure time three times the standard value .",
    "these observations serve two purposes : first , to obtain measurements of velocity dispersion for galaxies where the current , single - pass spectroscopy is only `` good enough for a redshift '' .",
    "second , given the discontinuity in targeting algorithm at @xmath84 ( the distinction between cut i and cut ii ; see eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) higher s / n spectra allow the exploration of possible spectroscopic changes due to differences in stellar populations at this transition .",
    "* faint lrgs : * the lrg cut ii sample aims for a flux - limited sample of lrg with redshifts roughly between 0.40 and 0.55 .",
    "we also experimented with an extension of this cut , going substantially fainter .",
    "the faint lrg sample has the following criteria : @xmath85 here , @xmath86 refers to the de vaucouleurs model magnitude in the @xmath3-band , and all colors are model colors .",
    "given the typical @xmath87 for lrgs , this is about 0.3 mag deeper than the @xmath88 cut ii sample , limited at @xmath89 .",
    "there are additional cuts , to select against , in sequence , very concentrated objects , very low surface brightness objects , and stellar objects , respectively : @xmath90    finally , objects that were targeted as part of normal target selection were removed .",
    "these objects were observed on plates that received the standard exposure times .",
    "* bcgs : * a separate program explicitly targeted the brightest galaxies in clusters . while lrgs are often the brightest galaxies in their clusters ( e.g. , loh & strauss 2005 ) , they need not be .",

    "( 2003 ) searches for galaxies with the apparent magnitudes and colors of lrgs , together with a red sequence of fainter ellipticals in the vicinity ( cf . , gladders & yee 2000 ) .",
    "the bcg program targeted bcg candidates found with this method , with estimated redshifts in the range @xmath91 .",
    "the maxbcg algorithm was run on photometry derived from co - adding the detections ( at the catalog level ) of multiple scans of the southern equatorial stripe .      *",
    "main extension : quasars : * in chunk 22 , the quasar target selection algorithm ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) was extended as follows . for objects selected from the @xmath92 color cube , the magnitude limit",
    "was changed from @xmath93 to 19.9 , while for the @xmath94 color cube ( where high - redshift quasars are selected ) , we changed the limit from @xmath95 to 20.4 .    as richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) describe , there are regions outside the stellar locus that are heavily contaminated by hot white dwarfs , m dwarf - white dwarf pairs ( smoli et al .",
    "2004 ) , and other non - quasars .",
    "these regions are explicitly excluded from quasar target selection in the main survey ; however , in the extension , they are allowed back in . similarly , there is a region of color space where @xmath96 quasars intersect the stellar locus . in the main survey ,",
    "objects falling in this region are sparse - sampled to 10% ( to reduce the number of stars ) ; in the extension , all objects falling in the mid-@xmath5 box defined in richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are targeted .",
    "* faint quasars:*the quasar target selection was further modified for the faint quasar targets on the merged plates on chunk 48 .",
    "in particular , the following are the changes over the standard quasar target selection algorithm described in richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) :    * the magnitude limit is set to @xmath97 , rather than @xmath93 for the @xmath92 color cube ; * the magnitude limit for optical counterparts to first ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) sources is set to @xmath98 , rather than @xmath93 ; * the standard quasar target selection algorithm requires that the estimated psf magnitude errors in @xmath4 and @xmath17 both be less than 0.1 for uv excess sources ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this limit is now set to 0.2 . * for uv excess objects with @xmath100 , we add a requirement that @xmath101 to minimize stellar contamination .",
    "* objects in the mid-@xmath5 box are excluded altogether . * in addition to the usual ` distance from the stellar locus ' algorithm used to target quasars , in the main sample there are hard color cuts used to select high - redshift quasars in the @xmath94 color cube .",
    "these color cuts are not used in the southern targeting . *",
    "finally , there were additional color cuts to reject unphysical objects affected by bad ccd columns ; we required @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "* m31 quasars : * low - redshift quasars were targeted on the m31 imaging data ( chunk 72 ) using the standard quasar selection algorithm ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) , but excluding the high - redshift candidates selected from the @xmath94 cube .",
    "the confirmed quasars can be used to probe gas in the halo of m31 .",
    "the plates used for this program also included f star targets , as described in   [ sec : kinematics ] .    *",
    "double - lobed radio sources : * quasar target selection targets unresolved optical counterparts to first radio sources , while `` serendipity '' target selection ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) selects first sources with extended optical counterparts .",
    "this works fine for compact or core - dominated radio sources , but is less effective for double - lobed radio sources , in which the optical counterpart is associated with a point between the two lobes .",
    "an algorithm was developed to find these double - lobed sources , including allowing for the more challenging case of _ bent _ double sources .",
    "in particular , pairs of first sources separated by @xmath104 or less without sdss optical counterparts were identified .",
    "given the distance @xmath105 between the centers of these two sources , a rectangle is drawn centered at the midpoint between the sources , with dimensions @xmath106 , with the short axis parallel to the line connecting the two sources .",
    "this box size was chosen empirically to include the core of a sample of bent double sources compiled by e. blanton ( see blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) . optical counterparts with @xmath107 that fell into the box were selected as bent double counterparts .",
    "a subset of those objects , which fell into a 12 arcsec square centered on the midpoint between the sources , were selected as straight double counterparts .",
    "* variability : * as discussed above , the southern equatorial stripe has been imaged multiple times in the course of the sdss , allowing photometric variability to be studied .",
    "variable sources were selected for follow - up spectroscopy using pairs of observations of unique unsaturated point sources with @xmath108 , and requiring that the changes in the @xmath17 and @xmath6 bands exceed 0.1 mag , and are at least 3 sigma significant ( using error estimates computed by the photometric pipeline ) .",
    "the time difference between the two observations varied from 56 days to 1212 days .",
    "this target selection produced targets on the southern equatorial stripe with a surface density of @xmath109 objects deg@xmath110 , after removing those objects which already had sdss spectra .",
    "the majority of these targets have colors consistent with @xmath111 ( uv excess ) quasars and rr lyrae stars , classifications confirmed by the spectroscopy .",
    "two classes of targets were assigned , based on apparent magnitude : the high priority objects were those with @xmath3 magnitude brighter than 19.5 , and the low - priority objects had @xmath112 . in practice , all targets were tiled on the plates observed .",

    "this was found to be due to a systematic overestimation of the sky levels in the vicinity of bright objects , which of course will affect all the measured photometric quantities of faint objects , including the classification as stars and galaxies .",
    "the brighter the object , the larger the overestimation of sky ; indeed , restricting to foreground galaxies brighter than @xmath118 , the number density of fainter galaxies is 10% below the mean .",
