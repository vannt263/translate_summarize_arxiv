    "modern observations @xcite indicate that the universe is expanding with acceleration .",
    "the most favored explanation of this acceleration is nowadays that the universe is dominated ( to about 70% ) by some unknown form of energy density with large negative pressure , termed dark energy ( de ) , while the remaining 30% consisting of baryonic and nonbaryonic visible and dark matter .",
    "it is often admitted that de can be modeled by a self - interacting scalar field with a potential .",
    "such a field acts as a negative pressure source ; it is called quintessence if its pressure to density ratio @xmath0 and a phantom field if @xmath1 while @xmath2 corresponds to a cosmological constant @xmath3 .",
    "since observations admit a range of @xmath4 including @xmath2 , all sorts of models are under study .",
    "one should note that values @xmath1 seem to be not only admissible but even preferable for describing an increasing acceleration , as follows from the most recent estimates : @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) @xcite ( according to the 7-year wmap data ) and @xmath7 @xcite ( mainly from data on type ia supernovae from the snls3 sample ) . in this connection ,",
    "cosmological models with phantom scalar fields , i.e. , those with a negative kinetic term , have gained considerable attention in the recent years @xcite .",
    "if such fields can play an important role in cosmology , it is natural to expect that they manifest themselves in local phenomena , for instance , in the existence and properties of black holes and wormholes @xcite .",
    "quite a number of scalar field configurations of this kind have been described in the literature , see , e.g. , examples of with scalar fields ( the so - called scalar hair ) in @xcite and supported by scalar fields in @xcite and references therein .",
    "thus , in @xcite it was shown that , in addition to , a phantom scalar can support a regular  where a possible explorer , after crossing the event horizon , gets into an expanding universe instead of a singularity .",
    "thus such hypothetic configurations combine the properties of a wormhole ( absence of a center , a regular minimum of the area function ) and a  ( a killing horizon separating r and t regions )",
    ". moreover , the kantowski - sachs cosmology that occurs in the t region is asymptotically isotropic and approaches a de sitter regime of expansion , which makes such models potentially viable as models of our accelerating universe .",
    "such configurations , termed _ black universes , _ were later shown to exist with other scalar field sources exhibiting a phantom behavior such as k - essence @xcite and some brane world models @xcite ( in the latter case , even without a phantom field ) .",
    "both wormholes and black universes have been shown to exist as well in models where a scalar field exhibits phantom properties only in a strong - field region while in the weak - field region it obeys the canonical field equation ( the so - called _ trapped - ghost models _ ) @xcite    to see whether or not such solutions can lead to viable models of black holes and wormholes , one needs to check their stability against various perturbations .",
    "previously , gravitational stability as well as passage of radiation through wormholes supported by a phantom scalar field were considered , in particular , in @xcite , with a special emphasis on massless wormholes ( see also references therein ) .    in the present paper , we consider the linear stability of various solutions to the field equations of general relativity with minimally coupled scalar fields , describing compact objects of interest such as asymptotically flat and ads wormholes ( m - ads wormholes , for short , where m stands for `` minkowski '' ) and black universes ( in other words , m - ds regular black holes ) , and use as examples solutions obtained in @xcite . we show that m - ads wormholes are unstable in the whole range of the parameters while among black universes there is a stable subfamily which corresponds to the event horizon located precisely at the minimum of the area function .",
    "the particular solutions whose stability is studied here are certainly not general .",
    "a more comprehensive study is prevented by the fact that a sufficiently general solution describing self - gravitating scalar fields with nonzero potentials is unknown , therefore it seems to be a natural decision to study the properties of known special solutions . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "all possible regular  solutions to the field equations were classified for phantom minimally coupled scalar fields with arbitrary potentials .",
    "one can see that the solution studied here , being certainly special , still represents a very simple but quite typical example reproducing the generic features of such configurations with flat , ds and ads asymptotics ;",
    "its another advantage is that it reproduces as a cpecial case the well - known ellis wormhole , for which the stability results are already known @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.ii presents the backgrounds to be considered .",
    "sec.iii develops a general formalism for axial gravitational and maxwell field perturbations in a static , spherically symmetric background .",
    "sec.iv is devoted to polar spherically symmetric perturbations .",
    "sec.v discusses the stability of the black universes and wormholes under consideration and analyzes the quasinormal radiation spectrum for the cases where the background configuration is linearly stable .",
    "in addition , we there develop a numerical tool for reducing the wavelike equation with a singular potential to the one with a regular potential . in sec.vi",
    "we summarize the results and mention some open problems .",
    "let us consider lagrangians of the form [ lagrangian ] l = ( r + g^ _ ;_; - 2 v ( ) - f _ f^ ) , which includes a scalar field , in general , with some potential @xmath8 , and an electromagnetic field @xmath9 ; @xmath10 distinguishes normal , canonical scalar fields ( @xmath11 ) and phantom fields ( @xmath12 ) . in what follows , we present a perturbation analysis for static , spherically symmetric solutions for this general type of lagrangian and then study the stability of some particular ( electrically neutral ) solutions .",
    "the general  metric can be written in the form [ metric ] ds^2 = a(r ) dt^2 - a(r)^-1 dr^2 - r(r)^2 d^2 , where @xmath13 is the linear element on a unit sphere .",
    "we will consider the following static background @xcite : r(r ) = ( r^2 + b^2)^1/2 , b = > 0 , [ sol - pha1 ] a(r ) = ( r^2 + b^2 ) , = ^-1 ( r / b ) .",
    "it is a solution to the einstein - scalar equations that follow from ( [ lagrangian ] ) with @xmath14 and the potential [ v - pha1 ] v ( ) = - - .",
    "the solution behavior is controlled by the scale @xmath15 and two integration constants : @xmath16 that moves the curve @xmath17 up and down , and @xmath18 showing the position of the maximum of @xmath19 .",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath19 are even functions if @xmath21 , otherwise @xmath19 loses this symmetry .",
    "asymptotic flatness at @xmath22 implies 2bc = -3 m , [ as - flat ] where @xmath18 is the schwarzschild mass defined in the usual way .    under this asymptotic flatness assumption , for @xmath23 , we obtain the simplest symmetric configuration , the ellis  @xcite : @xmath24 , @xmath25 . with @xmath26",
    ", we obtain a  with an ads metric at the far end , corresponding to the cosmological constant @xmath27 . further on ,",
    "such configurations will be referred to as m - ads  ( where m stands for minkowski , the flat asymptotic ) .",
    "assuming @xmath28 , at large negative @xmath29 we obtain negative @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 , and a potential tending to @xmath32 .",
    "thus it is a regular  with a de sitter asymptotic behavior far beyond the horizon , precisely corresponding to the above description of a black universe .    in black - universe solutions ,",
    "the horizon radius depends on both parameters @xmath18 and @xmath15 ( @xmath33 ) , which also plays the role of a scalar charge since @xmath34 at large @xmath29 . since @xmath35 ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath20 , located at @xmath36 , occurs in the r region if @xmath37 , i.e. , if @xmath38 ( it is then a throat , like that in ) , right at the horizon if @xmath39 ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) and in the t region beyond it if @xmath41 , that is , @xmath42 .",
    "it is then not a throat , since @xmath29 is a time coordinate , but a bounce in one of the scale factors @xmath20 of the  cosmology ; the other scale factor is @xmath30 .",
    "let us mention that another important case of the system ( [ lagrangian ] ) , the one with @xmath25 , has already been studied in a number of papers .",
    "in this case we are dealing with fisher s famous solution ( @xcite , 1948 ) for a canonical massless scalar in ( @xmath11 ) and three branches of its counterpart for @xmath43 , sometimes called the anti - fisher solution , found for the first time by bergmann and leipnik @xcite in 1957 and repeatedly rediscovered afterwards ( as well as fisher s solution ) . in the latter case",
    "the solution consists of three branches , one representing  @xcite , the other two also containing throats but with singularities or horizons of infinite area at the far end instead of another spatial infinity @xcite .",
    "an instability of fisher s solution under perturbations was established long ago @xcite , a similar instability of the  branch was discovered in @xcite and the same for the other two branches in @xcite .",
    "the case of zero mass in the anti - fisher solution represents the ellis  and is common with the solution under study , ( [ sol - pha1 ] ) , @xmath44 .    in what follows",
    ", we will assume @xmath45 and use the mass @xmath18 ( which has the dimension of length and is equal to half the schwarzschild radius in the units employed ) as a natural length scale , putting , for convenience , @xmath46 .",
    "then the constant @xmath16 is used as a family parameter while @xmath15 is found from the relation ( [ as - flat ] ) .",
    "we should remark that in all particular examples to be tested here for stability the background electromagnetic field is zero , but the general perturbation formalism is developed in sec iii for axial perturbations of systems with non - zero @xmath47 as well .",
    "actually in sec iv non - zero @xmath47 is also allowed , simply because the monopole perturbations do not excite an electromagnetic field in a spherically symmetric background .",
    "perturbations of the electromagnetic field appear in higher multipoles of polar modes .",
    "the general formalism developed for non - zero @xmath47 is intended to be used in further studies of systems with both scalar and electromagnetic fields .",
    "in our analysis of axial perturbations , we use chandrasekhar s notations : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , so that the coordinates along which the background has killing vectors are enumerated first .",
    "following chandrasekhar @xcite , we consider the metric ( [ metric ] ) as a special case of the metric [ ds - cha ] d s^2 = e^2 d t^2 - e^2 ( d - d t - q_2 d r - q_3 d ) ^2 - e^2 _ 2 d r^2 - e^2_3 d ^2 .",
    "thus in ( [ metric ] ) e^2 = a(r ) ,   e^2_2 = a^-1(r ) , e^2_3 = r(r)^2 , e^2 = r(r)^2 ^2 .",
    "the background electromagnetic field is taken in the form f_02 = -q_*/r(r)^2 , that is , only a radial electric field , and @xmath52 is the ( effective ) charge .",
    "all calculations and results can be easily rewritten for magnetic fields , with nonzero @xmath53 , owing to the maxwell field duality .",
    "one can bear in mind that configurations like  and black universes can possess electric or magnetic fields without any real electric charges or magnetic monopoles , due to their geometry , actually realizing wheeler s concept of a `` charge without charge '' .",
    "it is easy to see that axial perturbations of a scalar field vanish .",
    "then , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are perturbed , while @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 remain unperturbed .",
    "the axial gravitational perturbations obey the equations r_13 = 0 , r_12 = 2 q _ * r^-2 f_01    let us introduce new variables : [ -1 ] q_ik = q_i , k -q_k , i , q_i0 = q_i , 0 -_,i , with @xmath61 , and e f_01 .",
    "recall that we use the numbers @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath29 and @xmath65 coordinates , respectively .",
    "the maxwell equations , subject to only first - order perturbations , have the form ( e^+ _ 2 f_12)_,3 + ( e^+ _ 3 f_31)_,2 = 0 , ( e^+ f_01)_,2 + ( e^+ _ 2 f_12)_,0 = 0 , ( e^+ f_01)_,3 + ( e^+ _ 3 f_13)_,0 = 0 , ( e^_2 + _ 3 f_01)_,0 + ( e^+ _ 3 f_12)_,2 + ( e^+ _ 2 f_13)_,3 = e^+ _ 3 f_02 q_02 .",

    "then @xmath95 has no negative eigenvalues , in other words , there are no normalizable solutions to the corresponding  equation with well - behaved initial data ( smooth data on a compact support ) that grow with time , and the system under study is then stable under this particular form of perturbations . therefore ,",
    "in our stability studies , our main concern will be regions where the effective potentials are negative since possible instabilities are indicated by such regions .",
    "the response of a stable black hole or wormhole to external perturbations is dominated at late times by a set of damped oscillations , called _ quasinormal modes _ ( qnms ) .",
    "quasinormal frequencies do not depend on the way of their excitation but are completely determined by the parameters of the configuration itself . thus quasinormal modes form a characteristic spectrum of proper oscillations of a black hole or a wormhole and could be called their `` fingerprints '' . apart from black hole physics , qnms are studied in such areas as gauge / gravity correspondence , gravitational wave astronomy @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the quasinormal boundary conditions for black hole perturbations imply pure incoming waves at the horizon and pure outgoing waves at spatial infinity . for asymptotically flat solutions , the quasinormal boundary conditions are [ psi - flat ] e^ i r _ * , r _ * .",
    "the proper oscillation frequencies correspond in a sense to a `` momentary perturbation '' , that is , to the situation where one looks at a response of the system ( say , a wormhole ) to initial perturbation when the source of the perturbation stopped to act .",
    "this is the essence of the word `` proper '' .",
    "thus , in the wormhole case , no incoming waves are allowed coming from either of the infinities .",
    "the issue of the boundary conditions for quasinormal modes of wormholes is not completely new and was considered in @xcite .    therefore , for wormholes the condition `` pure incoming waves at the horizon '' is replaced with `` pure outgoing waves at the other spatial infinity '' @xcite . for asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes or",
    ", the ads boundary creates an effective confining box @xcite , so that on the ads boundary one usually requires the dirichlet boundary conditions 0 , r _ * .",
    "this choice is not only dictated by the asymptotic of the wave equation at infinity but is also consistent with the limit of purely ads space - time : the qnms of an ads black hole approach the normal modes of empty ads space - time in the limit of a vanishing black hole radius @xcite .",
    "thus quasinormal modes of a compact object ( a black hole or wormhole ) in ads space - time look like normal modes of empty ads space - time `` perturbed '' by the compact object .",
    "if the effective potential is negative in some region , growing quasinormal modes can appear in the spectrum , indicating an instability of the system under such perturbations .",
    "it turns out that some potentials with a negative gap still do not imply instability .",
    "if there are no growing quasinormal modes in the black - hole or wormhole spectrum , this object is stable against linear perturbations",
    ".    it can be seen from ( [ veff1 ] ) ( provided that @xmath96 ) that the effective potential @xmath93 for radial perturbations forms an infinite wall located at a throat , with the generic behavior @xmath97 , since we have there @xmath98 . as a result , perturbations are independent at different sides of the throat , necessarily turn to zero at the throat itself , and we thus lose part of the information on their possible properties . to remove the divergence , one can use a method on the basis of s - deformations as described in @xcite for solutions with arbitrary potentials @xmath8 . for anti - fisher  ( @xmath99 )",
    "it was applied in @xcite .",
    "if the scalar potential @xmath8 is zero , the effective potential ( [ veff1 ] ) takes the form ( r ) = - - . in this case",
    "the general static solution ( @xmath100 ) to ( [ schr ] ) is [ statsol ] _ 0 ( r ) = c_1 r ( 1- )   + , and its special cases with @xmath101 and @xmath102 were used in @xcite to remove the divergence in @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , we can introduce the new wave function [ o - psi ] = s- , s= , which satisfies the equation [ o - schr ] + ( ^2 - _ eff(r _ * ) ) = 0 with the effective potential [ o - veff ] _ eff = 2s^2 - , and the new effective potential is everywhere regular if either @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",

    ". then we integrate ( [ seq ] ) numerically and find @xmath109 between the throat and both asymptotical regions . having @xmath109 at hand ,",
    "we find the regularized effective potential ( [ o - veff ] ) ; it is finite at the throat due to ( [ sexp ] ) .",
    "we assigned different values to the free constant @xmath108 .",
    "as a rule , we were able to integrate ( [ seq ] ) numerically in a sufficiently wide range of @xmath29 near the throat .",
    "the regularized effective potentials obtained in this way always lead to the same growth rate of the perturbation function .",
    "however , for some particular values of @xmath108 , the numerical integration with the wolfram mathematica built - in function encounters a growing numerical error .",
    "apparently , in these cases some alternative methods of integration should be used .    in addition",
    ", we used the same method to find numerically the regularized potential for the branch b anti - fisher solution whose stability properties had been studied previously @xcite . although the numerically found potential differs from ( 68 ) of @xcite , the time - domain profile again shows the same growth rate .",
    "this confirms the correctness of the method suggested and used here .",
    "now we are in a position to apply the above method to the special case of m - ads  ( [ sol - pha1 ] ) with @xmath26 , which are asymptotically ads as @xmath110 . in fig.[_fig1 ] one can see that although the initial ( singular ) effective potentials @xmath93 are positive definite , the regularized potentials @xmath111 are negative in some range around the throat and at the ads boundary .",
    "this behavior usually indicates an instability but does not guarantee it @xcite .",
    "therefore , to prove the instability of m - ads wormholes , we have used the time - domain integration method proposed by gundlach et al .",
    "@xcite and later used by a number of authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the method shows a convergence of the time - domain profile with diminishing the integration grid and increasing the precision of all computations .",
    "we imposed the dirichlet boundary conditions at the ads boundary , as described in @xcite .",
    "fig.[_fig2 ] shows examples of time - domain profiles for the evolution of perturbations .",
    "the growth of the signal allows us to conclude that such wormholes are unstable against radial perturbations . at larger @xmath16",
    "we found the regularized potential with deeper negative wells and observed a quicker growth of the signal .",
    "therefore we conclude that all such m - ads wormholes are unstable .",

    "black universes with @xmath117 , or equivalently @xmath118 , have no throat in the static region . from fig.[potc=-1_fig ]",
    "one can see that for @xmath39 the effective potential has a negative gap , however , time - domain integration proves that in this case the black universe is stable . for smaller values of @xmath16 , an additional negative gap appears between the peak and the horizon , leading to an instability even for @xmath119 . for large negative @xmath16",
    "the potential peak disappears , and the potential becomes negative everywhere ( see fig.[potcn_fig ] ) , which inevitably creates an instability .",

    "we numerically find the regularized effective potentials which have large negative gaps leading to instabilities ( see figs.[butrans ] , [ butranslim ] ) .",
    "as @xmath16 approaches zero , the growth rate of time - domain profile decreases , still remaining positive because the effective potential remains negative in a wide region near the throat ( fig.[butrans ] ) .",

    ", the effective potential can take large negative values , but this has no effect on perturbations propagating outside the horizon .",
    "we therefore conclude that the black universes under consideration are stable against axial perturbations in the static region .",
