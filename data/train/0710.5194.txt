    "wireless networks consist of a number of nodes communicating over a shared wireless channel .",
    "the design and analysis of such configurations , even in their simplest forms , are among the most difficult problems in information theory . however , as the number of nodes becomes large , wireless networks become more tractable , where scaling laws for network parameters , such as throughput , can be derived .",
    "most of the works dealing with the throughput of large wireless networks consider a channel model in which the signal power decays according to a distance - based attenuation law @xcite .",
    "however , in a wireless environment , the presence of obstacles and scatterers adds some randomness to the received signal .",
    "this random behavior of the channel , known as fading , can drastically change the scaling laws of a network in both multihop @xcite and single - hop scenarios ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8),@xcite . in this paper , we follow the model of @xcite , where fading is assumed to be the dominant factor affecting the strength of the channels between nodes .    in this work",
    ", we consider a single - hop network , i.e. , a network in which data is transmitted directly from sources to their corresponding receivers without utilizing any other nodes as routers .",
    "each communication link can be active and transmit with a constant power @xmath1 or remain silent .",
    "throughput and rate - per - link are the network parameters which are of concern to us . despite the randomness of the channel , we are only interested in events that occur with high probability , i.e. , with probability tending to one as @xmath7 .",
    "this deterministic approach to random wireless networks has been also deployed in @xcite .    in a previous work by the authors @xcite , the throughput maximization of a single - hop wireless network in a rayleigh fading environment has been investigated without any rate constraints .",
    "it is shown that the maximum throughput scales like @xmath8 .",
    "also , a decentralized link activation strategy , called the threshold - based link activation strategy ( tblas ) , is proposed that achieves this scaling law . the throughput maximization using tblas yields an average rate per active link that approaches zero as @xmath7 .",
    "the same phenomenon has been observed in @xcite .",
    "since most of the existing efficient channel codes are designed for moderate rates , it is a drawback for a system to have zero - approaching rates .",
    "thus , from a practical point of view , it is appealing to assign constant rates to active communication links . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that a nondecreasing rate - per - node is achievable when nodes are mobile .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of rate - constrained throughput maximization in a rayleigh fading environment .",
    "more specifically , the objective is to maximize the number of active links such that each active link can transmit with a constant rate @xmath2 .",
    "we derive an upper bound that shows the number of active links scales at most like @xmath3 . to obtain a lower bound ,",
    "first , we examine the simple tblas of @xcite and show that it is capable of guaranteeing rate - per - links equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the number of active links provided by this method scales like @xmath9 .",
    "the scaling factor is close to the optimum when @xmath2 is small .",
    "however , as @xmath2 grows large , the scaling factor decays exponentially with @xmath2 , making it far below the upper bound @xmath10 .",
    "this inspires developing an improved link activation strategy that works well for large values of desired rates , as well . to this end",
    ", we propose a double - threshold - based link activation strategy ( dtblas ) .",
    "dtblas is attained by adding an interference management phase to tblas .",
    "this is done by choosing from good enough links only those with small enough mutual interference .",
    "the analysis of dtblas is more complicated than that of tblas .",
    "however , it can be carried out using some results from the random graph theory . it is shown that dtblas performs very close to the optimum .",
    "indeed , its performance reaches the upper bound when the demanded rate approaches @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "this shows the asymptotic optimality of dtblas for the rate - constrained throughput maximization problem .    in all scenarios described above , the interference power is much larger than the noise power and the rates become independent of _ signal - to - noise ratio _",
    "( _ snr _ ) . in other words ,",
    "the network performs in an interference - limited regime .",
    "a natural question is whether it is possible to have rate - per - links which depend on the _ snr_. the importance of this scenario , which is called the noise - limited regime , is that the transmission rate @xmath2 can be adjusted by adjusting the transmission power @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the answer to the above question is affirmative and the noise - limited regime can be realized by using dtblas .",
    "however , the throughput achieved by this method scales like @xmath11 , which is by a multiplicative factor of @xmath12 less than what is achievable in an interference - limited regime .",
    "it is worth mentioning that link activation strategies studied in this paper can be considered as special power allocation schemes .",
    "the problem of throughput maximization via power allocation is a challenging problem for which only suboptimum solutions have been reported @xcite .",
    "however , variations of this problem have been extensively studied in the literature , where the on - off scheme has frequently appeared .",
    "recently , for a decentralized utility - based network , it is shown that the optimum power allocation follows an on - off paradigm when the number of links is large @xcite .",
    "the on - off power allocation has been also used in @xcite for a cellular network in which the number of cell ( links ) are limited , but in each cell there are infinite number of users to choose from . for cellular systems ,",
    "a distributed joint power allocation and scheduling has been proposed in @xcite , in which again an on - off strategy is followed .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ system ] , network model and problem formulation are presented .",
    "an upper bound on the throughput is derived in section  [ upperbound ] . in sections",
    "[ lbdecentralized ]  and  [ lbcentralized ] , achievability results via decentralized and centralized schemes are presented .",
    "some optimality results are provided in section  [ optimality ] .",
    "the operation of the network in a noise - limited regime is investigated in section [ noise - limited ] .",

    "it is assumed that the links follow an on - off paradigm , i.e. , @xmath37 , where @xmath1 is a constant .",
