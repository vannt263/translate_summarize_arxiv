    "positron emission tomography ( pet ) and single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) are two modern imaging techniques with a wide range of medical applications .",
    "although these techniques were originally developed for the study of the _ functional _ characteristics of the brain , they are now used in many diverse areas of clinical medicine .",
    "for example a recent editorial in the new england journal of medicine @xcite emphasized the importance of pet in oncologic imaging .",
    "other medical applications of pet and spect are presented in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the first step in pet is to inject the patient with a dose of a suitable radiopharmaceutical .",
    "for example in brain imaging a typical such radiopharmaceutical is flurodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) , which is a normal molecule of glucose attached artificially to an atom of radioactive fluorine .",
    "the cells in the brain which are more active have a higher metabolism , need more energy , thus will absorb more fdg .",
    "the fluorine atom in the fdg molecule suffers a radioactive decay , emitting a positron . when a positron collides with an electron it liberates energy in the form of _ two _ beams of gamma rays travelling in _ opposite _ direction , which are picked by the pet scanner .",
    "spect is similar to pet but the radiopharmaceuticals decay to emit a _",
    "single _ photon .    in both pet and",
    "spect the radiating sources are inside the body , and the aim is to determine the distribution @xmath0 of the relevant radiopharmaceutical from measurements made outside the body of the emitted radiation . if @xmath1 is the @xmath2ray attenuation coefficient of the body , then it is straightforward to show @xcite that the intensity @xmath3 outside the body measured by a detector which picks up only radiation along the straight line @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a parameter along @xmath4 , and @xmath7 denotes the section of @xmath4 between the point @xmath8 and the detector .",
    "the attenuation coefficient @xmath1 is precisely the function measured by the usual computed tomography .",
    "thus the basic mathematical problem in spect is to determine the function @xmath0 from the knowledge of the `` transmission '' function @xmath1 ( determined via computed tomography ) and the `` emission '' function @xmath3 ( known from the measurements ) .    in pet",
    "the situation is simpler . indeed , since the sources eject particles _ pairwise _ in _ opposite _ directions and the radiation in opposite directions is measured _ simultaneously _ , equation ( [ lineint ] ) is replaced by @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the two half  lines of @xmath4 with endpoint @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath12 , equation ( [ inew ] ) becomes @xmath13 we recall that the line integral of the function @xmath1 along @xmath4 is precisely what is known from the measurements in the usual computed tomography .",
    "thus since both @xmath3 and the integral of @xmath1 are known ( from the measurements of spect and of computed tomography respectively ) , the basic mathematical problem of pet is to determine @xmath0 from the knowledge of its line integrals .",
    "this mathematical problem is identical with the basic mathematical problem of computed tomography .",
    "\\(i ) a point of a line @xmath4 making an angle @xmath14 with the @xmath15axis is specified by the three real numbers @xmath16 , where @xmath6 is a parameter along @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the distance from the origin to the line , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "\\(ii ) the above parameterization implies that , for a fixed @xmath14 , the cartesian coordinates @xmath8 can be expressed in terms of the _ local coordinates _ @xmath21 by the equations ( see section [ math ] ) @xmath22 a function @xmath1 rewritten in local coordinates will be denoted by @xmath23 , @xmath24 thus @xmath23 and @xmath25 will denote the @xmath2ray attenuation coefficient @xmath1 and the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical @xmath0 , rewritten in local coordinates .",
    "( iii ) the line integral of a function @xmath26 is called its _ radon transform _ and will be denoted by @xmath27 . in order to compute @xmath27 , we first write @xmath26 in local coordinates and then integrate with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath28 the line integral of the function @xmath29 with respect to the weight @xmath26 appearing in equation ( [ lineint ] ) is called the _ attenuated radon transform _ of @xmath29 ( with the attenuation specified by @xmath26 ) and will be denoted by @xmath30 . in order to compute @xmath30 , we write both @xmath29 and @xmath26 in local coordinates and then evaluate the following integral @xmath31      the basic mathematical problem of both computed tomography and pet is to reconstruct a function @xmath26 from the knowledge of its radon transform @xmath32 , i.e.  to solve equation ( [ radon ] ) for @xmath1 in terms of @xmath33 . the relevant formula is called the _ inverse radon transform _ and is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes principal value integral .    a novel approach for deriving equation ( [ irt ] ) was introduced in @xcite , and is based on the analysis of the equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a complex parameter different than zero . the application of this approach to a slight generalization of equation ( [ fnovel ] )",
    "can be used to reconstruct a function @xmath29 from the knowledge of its attenuated radon transform @xmath30 , i.e.  this approach can be used to solve equation ( [ art ] ) for @xmath0 in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath1 . the relevant formula , called the _ inverse attenuated radon transform _ ,",
    "was obtained by r.  novikov @xcite by analysing , instead of equation ( [ fnovel ] ) , the equation @xmath41      in section [ math ] we first review the analysis of equation ( [ fnovel ] ) , and then show that if one uses the basic result obtained in this analysis , it is possible to construct immediately the inverse attenuated radon transform . in section [ nume ]",
    "we present a new numerical reconstruction algorithm for both pet and spect .",
    "this algorithm is based on approximating the given data in terms of cubic splines .",
    "we recall that both the exact inverse radon transform as well as the exact inverse attenuated radon transform involve the hilbert transform of the data functions .",
    "for example , the inverse radon transform involves the function @xmath42 existing numerical approaches use the convolution property of the fourier transform to compute the hilbert transform and employ appropriate filters to eliminate high frequencies .",
    "it appears that our approach has the advantage of simplifying considerably the mathematical formulas associated with these techniques .",
    "furthermore , accurate reconstruction is achieved , for noiseless data , with the additional use of an averaging or of a median filter .",
    "several numerical tests are presented in section [ tests ] .",
    "one of these tests involves the shepp ",
    "logan phantom @xcite , see figure [ petphan](c ) .    numerical algorithms based on the filtered back projection are discussed in @xcite@xcite , while algorithms based on iterative techniques can be found in @xcite@xcite .",
    "[ math ]    we first review the basic result of @xcite .",
    "it will be shown later that using this result it is possible to derive both the inverse radon as well as the inverse attenuated radon transforms in a straightforward manner .",
    "define the complex variable @xmath43 by @xmath44 where @xmath15 , @xmath45 are the real cartesian coordinates @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath39 is a complex variable , @xmath46 .",
    "assume that the function @xmath1 has sufficient decay as @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 satisfy the equation @xmath49 as well as the boundary condition @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the limits of @xmath39 as it approaches the unit circle from inside and outside the unit disc respectively , i.e. @xmath54    then @xmath55 where @xmath32 denotes the radon transform of @xmath26 , @xmath56 denotes @xmath26 in the local coordinates ( see the notation in section [ intro ] ) , @xmath57 denote the usual projection operators in the variable @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath37 denotes the principal value integral .",
    "[ firstprop ]    * proof*. before deriving this result , we first note that equation ( [ defz ] ) is a direct consequence of equation ( [ fnovel ] ) . indeed ,",
    "equation ( [ fnovel ] ) motivates the introduction of the variable @xmath43 defined by equation ( [ defz ] ) . taking the complex conjugate of equation ( [ defz ] ) we find @xmath59 equations ( [ defz ] ) and ( [ conz ] ) define a change of variables from @xmath8 to @xmath60 .",
    "using this change of variables to compute @xmath61 and @xmath62 in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , equation ( [ fnovel ] ) becomes ( [ mueq ] ) .",
    "we now derive equation ( [ finmu ] ) .",
    "the derivation is based on the following two steps , which have been used extensively in the field of nonlinear integrable pdes , see for example @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) in the first step ( sometimes called the direct problem ) , we consider equation ( [ mueq ] ) as an equation which defines @xmath65 in terms of @xmath26 , and we construct an integral representation of @xmath65 in terms of @xmath26 , for _ all complex _ values of @xmath39 .",
    "this representation is @xmath66    indeed , suppose that the function @xmath67 satisfies the equation @xmath68 as well as the boundary condition @xmath50 as @xmath69",
    ". then pompieu s formula ( see for example @xcite ) implies @xmath70 in our case @xmath71 thus equation ( [ pomp ] ) becomes ( [ repre ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in the second step ( sometimes called the inverse problem ) , we analyze the analyticity properties of @xmath65 with respect to @xmath39 , and we find an _ alternative _ representation for @xmath65 .",
    "this representation involves certain integrals of @xmath26 called spectral functions . for our problem , this representation is equation ( [ finmu ] ) . indeed ,",
    "since @xmath65 is an analytic function of @xmath39 for @xmath72 and since @xmath73 as @xmath74 , we can reconstruct the function @xmath65 if we know its `` jump '' across the unit circle : @xmath75 where @xmath76 thus we need to compute the limits of @xmath65 as @xmath39 tends to @xmath77 . as @xmath78 ,",
    "@xmath79 substituting this expression in the definition of @xmath43 ( equation ( [ defz ] ) ) and simplifying , we find @xmath80 the right  hand side of this equation can be rewritten in terms of the local coordinates @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath6 , @xmath82 : let @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote two unit vectors along the line @xmath4 and perpendicular to this line , respectively . then @xmath85 or @xmath86 hence @xmath15 and @xmath45 are given by equations ( [ x1x2 ] ) .",
    "inverting these equations we find @xmath87 thus equation ( [ zz ] ) becomes @xmath88 substituting this expression in equation ( [ repre ] ) and using the fact that the relevant sign equals 1 , we find @xmath89 using the change of variables @xmath90 defined by equations ( [ x1x2 ] ) and ( [ taurho ] ) , and noting that the relevant jacobian is 1 , i.e. @xmath91 we find that the right  hand side of equation ( [ musim ] ) equals @xmath92    in order to simplify this expression we split the integral over @xmath93 in the form @xmath94 and note that in the first integral @xmath95 , while in the second integral @xmath96 .",
    "thus , using the second set of equations ( [ p+- ] ) the expression in ( [ intint ] ) becomes @xmath97 finally , adding and subtracting the integral @xmath98 we find @xmath99 the first two terms in the right  hand side of this equation equal @xmath100 , hence we find ( [ finmu])@xmath101 .",
    "the derivation of equation ( [ finmu])@xmath102 is similar .    0.3 cm    using equation ( [ finmu ] ) it is now straightforward to derive both the inverse radon and the inverse attenuated radon transforms . in this respect",
    "we note that the result of proposition [ firstprop ] can be rewritten in the form @xmath103 where @xmath104      equations ( [ finmu ] ) yield @xmath105 equation ( [ murad ] ) implies @xmath106 substituting this expression in equation ( [ fnovel ] ) we find @xmath107 replacing in this equation @xmath108 by the right  hand side of equation ( [ capj ] ) we find equation ( [ irt ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ gnovel ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 is defined by equation ( [ nu ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath111 \\right ) = \\frac{g}{\\nu } \\exp \\!\\!\\left [ \\partial_{\\bar{z}}^{-1 } \\left ( \\frac{f}{\\nu } \\right ) \\right],\\ ] ] or @xmath112 = \\partial_{\\bar{z}}^{-1 } \\left ( \\frac{g}{\\nu } \\exp \\!\\!\\left [ \\partial_{\\bar{z}}^{-1 } \\left ( \\frac{f}{\\nu } \\right ) \\right ] \\right).\\ ] ] replacing in this equation @xmath113 by the right  hand side of equation ( [ parbar ] ) we find @xmath114 for the computation of the right  hand side of this equation we use again equation ( [ parbar ] ) , where @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath29 times the two exponentials appearing in the above relation .",
    "hence @xmath115 note that the term @xmath116 $ ] is independent of @xmath82 , thus this term comes out of the integral @xmath117 , and furthermore the same term appears in the left  hand side of equation ( [ p+-new ] ) .",
    "hence when computing the jump @xmath118 , the second term in the right  hand side of equation ( [ p+-new ] ) cancels and we find that the relevant jump in now given by @xmath119 where @xmath6 and @xmath18 are expressed in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath45 by equations ( [ taurho ] ) .    equation ( [ murad ] ) is still valid , furthermore equation ( [ fx1x2 ] ) is valid if @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath29 . hence replacing in equation ( [ fx1x2 ] ) @xmath26 by @xmath29",
    "we find @xmath120 where @xmath108 is defined by equation ( [ jump ] ) .",
    "this formula is equivalent to novikov s formula .",
    "_ in summary , let @xmath121 be defined by equation ( [ art ] ) , let @xmath23 denote the function @xmath1 written in local coordinates ( see the notation ) and let @xmath122 denote the radon transform of @xmath1 ( see equation ( [ radon ] ) )",
