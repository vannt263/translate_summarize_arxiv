    "spiral arms in disk galaxies are regions of ongoing active star formation , sharply outlined by bright young star complexes .",
    "they usually span the entire optical disks and sometimes extend even to outer gaseous disks ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    ". such large - scale spiral patterns may be the manifestation of spiral density waves which propagate with a constant pattern speed through stellar disks @xcite , or may be transient features driven , for example , by tidal interactions with companion galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . regardless of the origin of spiral features",
    ", it is widely accepted that the interstellar medium ( ism ) is strongly compressed when it encounters stellar arms , forming narrow dust lanes in optical images ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the densest parts of the shocked layers subsequently undergo gravitational collapse and produce downstream secondary structures , such as ob star complexes and giant regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , filamentary gaseous spurs ( also referred to as `` feathers ; '' e.g. , @xcite ) , and giant molecular associations or atomic superclouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since shock compression within the arms is the first step towards star formation in grand - design spiral galaxies , understanding structural and dynamical evolution of these gas flows is essential to a host of fundamental problems , such as global star formation rates , the nature of the hubble sequence , galaxy evolution , etc . since the pioneering work of @xcite who obtained one - dimensional stationary shock profiles ,",
    "there have been numerous studies of the structure of galactic spiral shocks under the simplifying assumption that the gas remains isothermal ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite showed that the one - dimensional shock profiles found by @xcite represent stable equilibria when the fluid quantities are allowed to vary only in the direction perpendicular to the arms .",
    "the growth of axisymmetric self - gravitating modes is limited by postshock expansion @xcite .    when the direction parallel to the arm is included in models , on the other hand , isothermal spiral shocks in two dimensions",
    "are prone to various kinds of instabilities .",
    "@xcite showed that when self - gravity is included , spiral arms are unstable to transient swing instability .",
    "when magnetic fields are included , spiral arms are subject to magneto - jeans instability , in which embedded parallel magnetic fields that exchange angular momentum limit the stabilizing effect of galaxy rotation , encouraging non - axisymmetric perturbations to grow into giant clouds and other arm substructures @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that spiral shocks in two - dimensional thin disk models are unstable to a vorticity - generating wiggle instability and develop arm substructures ( see also @xcite ) , although these in - plane modes appear to be suppressed by embedded magnetic fields @xcite or by vertical shear and mixing when all three dimensions are included in models @xcite .",
    "while steady in - plane shock solutions are subject to instability , shock models that include the vertical degree of freedom do not even have steady solutions .",
    "instead , the shock front in vertically stratified disks moves back and forth relative to the mean position @xcite .",
    "these shock `` flapping '' motions arise mainly because the vertical oscillation period of the gas is , in general , incommensurate with the arm - to - arm crossing time , so that the gas streamlines are not closed .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) showed that the shock flapping is able to feed random gas motions on the scale of disk scale height that persist despite dissipation .",
    "the induced gas velocity dispersions reach a sonic level , suggesting that spiral shocks may be a considerable source of the ism turbulence .",
    "motions driven by shock flapping motions destroy any coherent vortical structures that would otherwise grow near the spiral shocks , suppressing the wiggle instability .",
    "since gravity is a long - range force and insensitive to small scale density structure , however , magneto - jeans instabilities still grow within the arms in three - dimensional disk models , in spite of non - steady motions induced by shock flapping @xcite .",
    "phase transitions caused by thermal instability ( ti ) create a multiphase ism , with important consequences for galactic star formation . in the classical picture of the ism , ti changes an otherwise uniform ism into warm rarefied material and cold dense clouds in a rough pressure balance ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while there also exists significant mass in the thermally - unstable temperature range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "supernova blast waves create an additional , hot component that is organized into bubbles or cavities @xcite , although the total mass contained in the hot phase is much smaller than that in the cold and warm phases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "cold atomic clouds transform to molecular clouds if their volume density ( to produce molecules fast enough ) and column density ( to self - shield molecules against photodissociation ) are sufficiently high ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as in , for instance , shocks in turbulent flows @xcite . that the star - forming molecular clouds strongly correlate with spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "suggests that spiral shocks too should trigger phase transitions from warm and diffuse to cold and dense conditions .",
    "effects of ti on spiral shocks were first studied by @xcite , who calculated one - dimensional shock profiles consisting of two stable phases in equilibrium . although they allowed for phase transitions , they assumed instantaneous thermal equilibrium , which precluded the existence of transitory thermally - unstable gas in their calculations . using direct time - dependent numerical simulations including ism heating and cooling",
    ", @xcite and @xcite found that spiral shocks trigger phase transitions if the initial density is large enough . because of strong numerical diffusion associated with insufficient resolution , however , they were unable to capture ti in the postshock transition zone , which is the thermally unstable regime .    in ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) , we used high - resolution one - dimensional simulations to study dynamical and thermodynamical evolution of gas flows across spiral arms with ism heating , cooling , and thermal conduction .",
    "we found that even with ti , a quasi - steady state develops with the following recurring cycle : both warm and cold phases in the interarm region are shocked and immediately transform to denser cold gas in the arm , which subsequently evolves to be ti - unstable due to postshock expansion in a transition zone , and separates back into warm and cold phases .",
    "for a model with the initial number density of @xmath6 , the gas stays in the arm , transition , and interarm zones for 14% , 22% , and 64% of the arm - to - arm crossing time , respectively .",
    "the gas mass in the ti - unstable temperature range was @xmath7 of the total , and mostly located in the transition zone , suggesting that postshock expanding flows are important for producing intermediate - temperature gas .",
    "paper ii also found that ti in association with one - dimensional spiral shocks can drive random gas motions at @xmath8 in the interarm and transition zones ; these velocities are @xmath9 times larger than those from pure ti alone ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we extend the one - dimensional models of paper ii into two dimensions , in order to study the effect of vertical disk stratification on the dynamics and structure of multiphase galactic spiral shocks .",
    "the current work also extends the vertically - stratified isothermal models considered in paper i to include the effects of the ism heating and cooling .",
    "our key objective is to find how the flapping motions of spiral shocks inherent in stratified disks interact with multi - phase gas produced by ti , to change the shock structure and drive random gas motions in each phase .",
    "we also study the internal properties of clouds that form in self - gravitating models .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite ran sph simulations to study shock structure and cloud formation in three dimensions , they used pre - determined cold and warm particles and did not allow the transitions between them .",
    "@xcite included ism heating and cooling in the energy equation and thus handled ti self - consistently , focusing on the formation of molecular clouds in spiral shocks . using grid - based three - dimensional simulations ,",
    "@xcite studied dynamics of galactic gas flows under the influence of self - gravity , a spiral - arm potential , radiative cooling , star formation , and energy feedback from supernova explosions .",
    "although these three - dimensional global models are of course more realistic , our local models are useful for studying the detailed dynamics of spiral shocks at high spatial resolution , and allow us to isolate each effect of the physical processes involved .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the basic equations we solve and specify the model parameters . in ",
    "3 , we present the results of one - dimensional solutions for vertical disk equilibria including heating and cooling , also providing simple analytic expressions for the mass fractions and scale heights . in  4 , we present the overall evolution , structure , and statistical properties of spiral shock flows with ti in stratified disks , based on the results of two - dimensional simulations . the effect of self - gravity is discussed in  5 . in  6 , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "the local formulation used in the present study is similar to that in papers i and ii . in this section",
    ", we explain our numerical method and model parameters .",
    "we consider a local region centered on a spiral arm that is assumed to be tightly wound with a pitch angle @xmath10 and rotating at a constant pattern speed @xmath11 .",
    "we set up a local cartesian frame , centered at the position @xmath12 , that corotates with the spiral arm .",

    "for the cooling rate of the diffuse ism , we take the fitting formula suggested by @xcite , @xmath41 with temperature @xmath42 in degrees kelvin .    for the gas heating function , we consider two different cases : ( 1 ) a constant heating rate @xmath43 and ( 2 ) a density - dependent heating rate @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the first , uniform heating rate corresponds to the mean heating rate due to the photoelectric effect on small grains and pahs , photodissociations of hydrogen molecules , and ionizations by cosmic rays and x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the second , density - modified heating rate that increases stiffly with @xmath46 is to treat the effect of star formation feedback in a very simple way .",
    "without such a feedback , high - density clouds produced inside spiral arms in our self - gravitating models would undergo catastrophic collapse , preventing further computation . in the real ism",

    "more realistic feedback prescriptions will be considered in a subsequent paper .    figure  [ fig : np0 ] plots the equilibrium cooling curves in the density _ vs_.  pressure plane .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the uniform heating rate , while the dashed curve is for the modified heating rate .",
    "the dotted lines indicate isotherms .",
    "the modified heating rate changes the equilibrium curve dramatically only for high - density gas , while making a negligible difference for low - density material .",
    "the equilibrium pressure has a local maximum @xmath47 at @xmath48 for both heating rates , while attaining a local minimum at @xmath49 with @xmath50 for the constant heating rate , and at @xmath51 with @xmath52 for the modified heating rate . under the constant heating rate ,",
    "the gas temperature along the equilibrium curve is a monotonically decreasing function of density , although it is insensitive to @xmath46 at the low - density end with @xmath53 .",

    "the transition between the dense and rarefied phases occurs approximately at @xmath358 , insensitive to @xmath80 , as long as the disk is unstable to ti . without self - gravity , the vertical distribution of the rarefied gas in equilibrium",
    "is well fitted by a gaussian profile whose surface density is fixed to @xmath359 . when self - gravity is included , the gravity from the midplane dense layer compresses the overlying rarefied component further , forcing overpressured rarefied gas to transform to the dense phase .",
    "the resulting surface density of the rarefied gas is reduced to @xmath360 , with the reduction factor @xmath361 defined by equation ( [ eq : reduc ] ) . when @xmath362 , the disk has too low a pressure to produce the dense component ; equilibrium consists only of the rarefied gas .",

    "_  spiral - arm potential perturbations lead to spiral shocks in the gas , which are vertically curved and non - stationary , showing strong flapping motions perpendicular to the arms . similarly to the one - dimensional cases studied in paper ii , the shock compression and postshock expansion in two dimensions allow phase transitions , but only if the gas density at the shock and/or the postshock expansion zone reaches the thermally - unstable range ( @xmath365 ) . in model nu.s10 with @xmath102 and the uniform heating rate ,",
    "the shocked dense gas has large enough density that the postshock expansion is unable to return it to the thermally unstable regime . as a consequence",
    ", there is a large amount of interarm dense gas entering the shock in this model , which collides with other dense gas in the arm , producing dense condensations . in other models with lower surface density or the density - modified heating rate , the shocked gas re - expands and",
    "becomes thermally unstable , returning to either the dense or the rarefied phase in the interarm region .",
    "the shock flapping motions in our models arise due to the fact that the arm crossing time of gas is incommensurate with the vertical oscillation period , so that steady flows are not possible .",
    "seen from the upstream side , the shock is convex when the postshock regions are maximally compressed , and concave when the postshock vertical expansion is strongest .",
    "these non - steady motions of shock fronts are commonly seen in numerical simulations with sufficient resolution ( e.g. , @xcite ; paper i ; @xcite ) , although simulations with low resolution @xcite or particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) do not capture the flapping motions clearly .",
    "it is interesting to note that radio continuum images of the 5-kpc arm ( or the scutum arm ) toward the galactic longitude @xmath366 in the milky way shows a bow shock feature in the warm ionized medium with temperature @xmath367 @xcite , similarly to a convex shock front seen in figure  [ fig : na10]_b_. the radio emission from the bow shock is presumably thermal radiations from ionized gas , with emission measure of @xmath368 @xmath369 .",
    "the curvature of the observed bow shock , as measured by the longitudinal offset @xmath370 of the shock at latitude @xmath371 relative to the shock front at the midplane , is @xmath372 for @xmath373 .",
    "this value is about a half of the maximum curvature of the shock front @xmath374 in our s10 models , where @xmath156 denotes the shock position at height @xmath15 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the bow shock associated with the 5-kpc arm is most likely a cross section of a galactic spiral shock that is undergoing flapping motions .",
    "velocity information is needed to determine whether the 5-kpc arm regions are currently being compressed or expanding in the course of the flapping motions .",
    "in this paper , for consistency with our local approximation we have considered tightly wound arms with a very small pitch angle @xmath375 , and a pattern speed @xmath351 .",
    "observed spiral arms of external galaxies are often more loosely wound with @xmath376 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and span a wide range of galactocentric radii with differing @xmath377 . for fixed @xmath143 , a larger arm pitch angle would imply a larger streaming velocity @xmath378 perpendicular to the arm",
    "( see eq .",

    "spiral shocks would then become correspondingly stronger and shifted farther downstream ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xmath379 is increasingly small as @xmath11 approaches @xmath380 .",
    "consequently , the spiral shock as well as associated flapping motions would become weaker as one approaches corotation , where the gas would simply concentrate near the potential minimum , without involving a shock .",
    "\\3 . _ time - averaged shock structure . _",
    " within a few orbital times after the development of spiral shocks , gas flows reach a quasi - steady state in the sense that the mass fractions of dense and rarefied gas do not change appreciably with time . for models with @xmath102 , the quasi - steady mass fraction of the rarefied gas",
    "is @xmath381 , which can be compared to @xmath382 when the spiral potential is absent . despite the shock flapping motions , most of the gas is found close to thermal equilibrium , with a small fraction thermally unstable .",
    "the density and temperature pdfs are thus bimodal . for model nu.s10 ,",
    "the dense and rarefied peaks are located at @xmath197 and @xmath383 , respectively , and the dense part of the density pdf is described by a lognormal distribution .",
    "the time - averaged structure can be well represented by _ local _ vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , supported mainly by the thermal pressure rather than gas random motions .",
    "this indicates that the vertical hydrostatic balance is a reasonable approximation even in the presence of spiral shocks .",
    "the profiles of surface density perpendicular to the arm are more - or - less symmetric with a shock compression factor of @xmath89 , and have broad arm regions whose width correlates with the strength of the shock flapping motions .",
    "the fractional widths of the arm , postshock expansion zone , and interarm region are typically 10% , 20% , and 70% of the arm - to - arm distance , where the gas stays for 15% , 30% , and 55% of the arm - to - arm crossing time , respectively .",
    "the shock flapping motions in the xz plane make the arm wider than in one - dimensional spiral shocks where the arm takes up only 1% of the arm - to - arm distance ( paper ii ) .",
    "the dense gas produced from ti and shock compression tends to sink toward the midplane to form a thin slab , while high - altitude regions are dominated by warm rarefied gas .",
    "the thickness of the dense slab is @xmath384 , depending on the total gas content , heating rate , and presence / absence of self - gravity , while the scale height of the rarefied gas is @xmath385 insensitive to the parameters . for model nm.s10 ,",
    "the thickness ratio of the dense to rarefied components is about 5 , which is not much different from the results of @xcite who reported that the warm gas extends vertically up four times more than the cold gas . with high density and pressure",
    ", the dense slab would transform to molecular clouds if the appropriate chemical reactions for molecule formation were included ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thin distributions of the cold dense gas are in fact common in numerical simulations of galactic disks with ti where turbulence is driven by magnetorotational instability @xcite , stellar feedback via regions @xcite , or supernovae explosions @xcite .",
    "the observed molecular distribution the milky way has a scale height of @xmath386 within the solar circle , somewhat reduced for the most massive clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galactic regions are also within about @xmath387 of the midplane @xcite . in the inner galaxy and near the solar circle , the scale height of the cold layer is about 1.5 times smaller than the warm gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , although the cold and warm phases appear to have a similar scale height in the outer galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "\\4 . _ random gas motions driven by shock flapping motions .",
    "_  the flapping motions of spiral shocks stir the gas and supply random kinetic energy . allowing for incomplete subtraction of streaming motions in the arm region , the induced density - weighted velocity dispersions are @xmath388 for both dense and rarefied components for the non - self - gravitating models , with larger values corresponding to disks with larger @xmath80 . compared with the results of paper ii where the vertical coordinate was suppressed , these values are similar to those for the dense gas in the arms and larger by a factor of @xmath389 for the interarm rarefied gas .",
    "this implies that it is the rarefied gas that is more efficiently stirred by the shock flapping motions .",
    "the self - gravitating models have larger velocity dispersions , in the range @xmath390 for the dense and @xmath391 for the rarefied gas , indicating that self - gravity enhances shock flapping and velocity dispersions , especially for rarefied gas .",
    "these in - plane velocity dispersions in the current multiphase models are similar to those in the isothermal models considered in paper i.    the vertical velocity dispersions of the rarefied gas in nu and nm models are @xmath295 , insensitive to @xmath80 . in nu models , the vertical motions of the dense gas are excited preferentially by vertical motions of the rarefied gas . since the mass fraction of the rarefied gas decreases with @xmath80 , the vertical velocity dispersions of the dense gas in nu models is a decreasing function of @xmath80 , varying roughly as @xmath392 . in nm models ,",
    "the postshock gas is overpressured due to enhanced heating and thus expands vertically , increasing @xmath297 compared to nu models .",
    "the level of random gas motions in our models are generally smaller than the observed velocity dispersions @xmath393 for atomic gas in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , @xcite ) and for the larger molecular clouds in the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that other sources of the interstellar turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) must exceed that provided by spiral shocks .",
    "one of the dominant mechanisms is of course supernova explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "_ effect of self - gravity and properties of self - gravitating clouds . _",
    " when self - gravity is included , dense gas in sm models with @xmath394 suffers from gravitational instability , eventually forming two large clouds in each model .",
    "these are separate in the interarm regions , temporarily merge in the arm , and then break up into two pieces in the postshock expansion zone .",
    "these clouds have a radii @xmath395 and mass @xmath396 each , and are gravitationally bound with a virial parameter of @xmath397 . in our present models , we have not attempted to include realistic star formation feedback , but instead increase the heating rate at high density to prevent collapse . as a consequence ,",
    "the main support against self - gravity comes from thermal pressure .",
    "the mean thermal sound speed and internal velocity dispersion of the clouds are @xmath398 and @xmath399 , respectively . for models with @xmath113 ,",
    "self - gravity is insufficient to form bound clouds .",
    "nevertheless , self - gravity increases the dense gas fraction by a factor of @xmath3 compared to the non - self - gravitating counterpart of this model , which in turn decreases the vertical velocity dispersion of the dense gas by a similar factor .",
    "formation of self - gravitating clouds in our two - dimensional models requires the production of the dense gas due to ti , and then additional shock compression .",
    "although our present models do not capture the cloud destruction process , bound clouds created inside spiral arms may be disrupted before they leave the arms if feedback from star formation is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of high - density , self - gravitating clouds in the interarm regions opens an interesting possibility that the spiral shocks  where the diffuse gas is strongly compressed  do not necessarily coincide with the regions of highest gas density ( in gravitationally - bound clouds ) .",
    "for example , @xcite found strongly - polarized nonthermal radio emission that may trace magnetic arms , detected preferentially upstream of the co arms in the inner disk of the whirlpool galaxy m51 ( see also e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that the current unmagnetized models are not yet able to provide clues to the relation between gaseous and magnetic arms . it will be interesting to see how ti , spiral shocks , and realistic star formation feedback conspire with magnetized self - gravitating instabilities to create bound clouds and arm substructures ( possibly including separate magnetic arms ) , and to generate turbulence in the gas .",

    "<S> galactic spiral shocks are dominant morphological features and believed to be responsible for substructure formation within spiral arms in disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> they can also contribute a substantial amount of kinetic energy to the interstellar gas by tapping the ( differential ) rotational motion . </S>",
    "<S> we use numerical hydrodynamic simulations to investigate dynamics and structure of spiral shocks with thermal instability in vertically stratified galactic disks , focusing on environmental conditions ( of heating and the galactic potential ) similar to the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> we initially consider an isothermal disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and let it evolve subject to interstellar cooling and heating as well as a stellar spiral potential . </S>",
    "<S> due to thermal instability , a disk with surface density @xmath0 rapidly turns to a thin dense slab near the midplane sandwiched between layers of rarefied gas . </S>",
    "<S> the imposed spiral potential leads to a vertically curved shock that exhibits strong flapping motions in the plane perpendicular to the arm . the overall flow structure at saturation is comprised of arm , postshock expansion zone , and interarm regions that occupy typically 10% , 20% , and 70% of the arm - to - arm distance , in which the gas resides for 15% , 30% , and 55% of the arm - to - arm crossing time , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the flows are characterized by transitions from rarefied to dense phases at the shock and from dense to rarefied phases in the postshock expansion zone , although gas with too - large postshock - density does not undergo this return phase transition , instead forming dense condensations . </S>",
    "<S> if self - gravity is omitted , the shock flapping drives random motions in the gas , but only up to @xmath1 in the in - plane direction and less than @xmath2 in the vertical direction . </S>",
    "<S> time - averaged shock profiles show that the spiral arms in stratified disks are broader and less dense compared to those in unstratified models , and that the vertical density distribution is overall consistent with local effective hydrostatic equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of self - gravity increases the dense gas fraction by a factor @xmath3 and raises the in - plane velocity dispersion to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> when the disks are massive enough , with @xmath5 , self - gravity promotes formation of bound clouds that repeatedly collide with each other in the arm and break up in the postshock expansion zone . </S>"
