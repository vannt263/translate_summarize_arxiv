    "since the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) at @xmath6 @xcite , this state has drawn intense scrutiny .",
    "much of the motivation for the study of the @xmath6 state comes from the fact that numerical work @xcite has shown strong overlaps with the pfaffian wavefunction @xcite and its particle - hole conjugate state , the so - called anti - pfaffian @xcite , both of which are non - abelian and could find uses in topologically protected quantum computation @xcite .",
    "there have also , however , been theoretically proposed wavefunctions for the @xmath6 state that exhibit abelian statistics ( see @xcite for a summary of candidate states ) . to date",
    ", the experimental tests to determine the nature of the ground state at @xmath6 have failed to agree on the identity of the wavefunction .",
    "experiments probing the temperature dependence of tunneling between the edge states at @xmath6 have been proposed @xcite and conducted @xcite as a way to measure the quasiparticle effective charge @xmath10 and luttinger liquid interaction parameter @xmath11 in order to discriminate between proposed wavefunctions .",
    "these experiments , however , were inconclusive as tunneling experiments performed on the same hall bar mesa but with different electrostatic confinement potentials gave results consistent with the non - abelian anti - pfaffian and @xmath12 states @xcite and the abelian 331 state @xcite",
    ". later experients by a different group @xcite were most consistent with the 331 state , but recent measurements of the spin polarization at @xmath6 using nmr techniques @xcite indicate a fully spin - polarized electron gas which is inconsistent with the unpolarized 331 state @xcite .",
    "interferometry experiments showing an alternating aharanov - bohm period @xcite are also consistent with a non - abelian state at @xmath6 and thus appear to rule out the 331 state .",
    "as it is unclear how possible edge reconstruction @xcite due to shallow confining potentials might influence the interpretation of the tunneling experiments , it is possible that the different confinement parameters in the previously studied devices could be responsible for this apparent discrepancy .    given the complications associated with these experiments",
    ", it would therefore be desirable to examine transport in nanostructures in the quantum hall regime in samples in which the electron density and confining potential could be tuned simultaneously in a single structure .",
    "a variable density would also allow for direct comparisons between experimental results in the 2@xmath13 landau level ( ll ) and the more well - understood lowest ll in a single device without the need for extremely large magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , the original proposal @xcite for an edge - state interferometer designed to directly measure the quantum statistics of the quasiparticles at @xmath14 called for a device with a global back - gate to allow magnetic field sweeps at a constant filling fraction . as such , there is strong motivation for back - gated devices exhibiting strong fqhe in the 2@xmath13 ll concomitant with a large range of density tuneability .",

    "we have grown and processed a series of high quality , _ in - situ _ backgated two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) .",
    "the processing of similar devices of lower mobility has been reported @xcite and a similar high mobility device has been used to examine the energy gaps of fqhe states in the 2@xmath13 ll @xcite . however , to our knowledge there has not been a published systematic study of heterostructure design and processing conditions and their impact on the visibility of states in the 2@xmath13 ll .",
    "we studied three wafers utilizing two heterostructure designs summarized in fig .",
    "[ cross_section ] to study the impact of the heterostructure on the gate leakage and the low temperature transport .",
    "both designs feature a 2deg located approximately 200 nm from the surface in a 30 nm gaas quantum well flanked by al@xmath17ga@xmath18as barriers modulation doped from the top side only at a setback of @xmath2 70 nm .",
    "the dopants were incorporated in a so - called doping well scheme ( also known as a short - period superlattice ) @xcite which has been found empirically to maximize the fqhe energy gaps in the 2@xmath13 ll .",
    "the _ in - situ _ gate consisted of an n+ gaas layer situated 850 nm below the bottom interface of the quantum well .",
    "the key difference between the two designs was that in design # 1 an al@xmath17ga@xmath18as barrier of thickness @xmath19 nm separated the quantum well from a gaas / alas ( 2/2 nm ) superlattice while in design # 2 @xmath20 was decreased to 20 nm while keeping the overall gate setback fixed at 850 nm .",
    "wafers a and b utilized design # 1 while wafer c utilized design # 2 .",
    "device fabrication began by etching via holes to the gate layer using an etchant consisting of 50:5:1 water : phosphoric : peroxide followed by a second , @xmath2 160 nm deep etch to define 1 mm van der pauw square mesas .",
    "ohmic contacts consisted of a 8/80/160/36 nm stack of ni / ge / au / ni and were annealed for 1 min in forming gas at a variety of temperatures . following the annealing ,",
    "large tiau pads off of the mesa were deposited in order to facilitate wirebonding .",
    "figure [ contactr ] shows the effect of annealing temperature on the quality of the contacts and the gate leakage measured in the dark at t = 4 k on devices fabricated from wafer b. the lead resistance of the measurement setup was @xmath2 1 @xmath21 , so the 2-terminal resistance values quoted here are reasonable proxies for the true contact resistance . at an annealing temperature of 360 @xmath16c ,",
    "the contacts were electrically open at low temperature , and the contact morphology was extremely smooth , indicating that the metal did not melt or diffuse significantly during the anneal .",
    "figure [ contactr]b displays the effect of the annealing on the gate leakage . to quantify the leakage from our devices , we defined v@xmath15 as the gate voltage v@xmath22 at which the gate leakage current reached 1 na ; thus high values of v@xmath15 are expected for a high quality gate insulating layer .",
    "both the 2-terminal resistance and v@xmath15 decrease monotonically as the annealing temperature is increased and the niauge diffuses further into the semiconductor .    to further study the impact of mask design and processing parameters on the gate leakage and contact resistance , we fabricated a set of test structures ( not shown ) which gave evidence that the gate leakage was primarily through the annealed contacts and not through the bulk of the mesa .",
    "in addition , the test structures gave evidence that the leakage current density through annealed metal in etched regions was larger than that through annealed metal in un - etched regions .",
    "the increased electric field due to the decreased gate - contact separation in the etched regions was insufficient to account for this increase in leakage density .",
    "this observation appears to imply that the etching procedure enhances the subsequent diffusion of the contacts . with this in mind",
    ", we designed our lithographic mask sets to minimize the total ohmic area , particularly in the region off of the etched mesa . in our final design",
    "the total ohmic area was @xmath23 1.5 @xmath3 10@xmath24 @xmath25m@xmath26 per device , and the total ohmic overhang off each mesa was @xmath2 6000 @xmath25m@xmath26 . by minimizing the total time the etched sidewall of the mesa was exposed to air between the etch step and the metallization ( typically @xmath2 3 - 4 hours ) and optimizing the geometry of the ohmic contacts to include 45@xmath16 scallops , we were able to produce devices with acceptably low contact resistances in the range of a few hundred ohms while minimizing the gate leakage .     for devices fabricated with the optimized processing recipe and mask set .",
    "all the devices were annealed at 375 @xmath16c .",
    "the dashed line represents the voltage required to reach a 2deg density of @xmath2 3.2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5.,width=288 ]    next , we examined the impact of heterostructure design on device performance . using our optimized fabrication recipe and mask set , we fabricated devices on both wafers b and c , using an annealing temperature of 375 @xmath16c .",
    "figure [ histogram ] is a histogram of the leakage turn - on v@xmath15 for devices from each wafer .",
    "the leakage in the majority of devices from wafer b ( black bars ) turned on around 2.2 v while the leakage in devices from wafer c ( red bars ) typically turned on around 3.8 v. evidently , the proximity of the superlattice to the quantum well has a pronounced effect on the gate leakage .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ histogram ] represents the gate voltage required in our geometry to reach a 2deg density of @xmath2 3.2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , roughly twice the zero - bias density and the approximate electron density of 2degs exhibiting state - of - the - art energy gaps in the 2@xmath13 ll ( see for instance references @xcite ) . as the devices from wafer c clearly",
    "could be biased well beyond the point necessary to study the fqhe of the 2@xmath13 ll , we fabricated hall bar devices with larger contacts on wafer c to check how much less stringent the device design and fabrication requirements were for this wafer to exhibit acceptable gate leakage .",
    "these devices were based on a design @xcite known to both exhibit high quality transport in the 2@xmath13 ll and allow the incorporation of nanostructures .",
    "the total ohmic area per device was 3.0 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath25m@xmath28 with 4.6 @xmath3 10@xmath29 @xmath25m@xmath28 overhanging the edge of the mesa .",
    "even though the ohmic area in the etch field increased by a factor of @xmath2 8 and the total ohmic area increased by a factor of @xmath2 20 from our optimized mask design , the leakage turn - on in most devices was still beyond 2.5 v , further highlighting the importance of proper heterostructure design .",
    "we speculate that the large reduction in gate leakage in wafer c is due to two effects .",
    "first , the alternating layers of the superlattice act as a diffusion barrier @xcite to the metal from the ohmic contacts ; thus , by moving the superlattice closer to the quantum well , less metal is able to diffuse towards the gate , thereby reducing the shorting of the ohmics to the gate .",
    "in addition , fowler - nordheim tunneling @xcite from the bulk of the 2deg to the gate can be expected to be reduced by moving the tall alas barriers of the superlattice closer to the 2deg .",
    "while moving the superlattice closer to the quantum well has the benefit of dramatically increasing the maximum achievable density , it also has the undesirable consequence of placing a significant amount of alas close to the quantum well .",
    "it is known that al is an effective getter of vacuum impurities during mbe growth @xcite , and thus moving the superlattice closer to the 2deg may degrade the quality of the fqhe states .",
    "indeed , the average maximum electron mobility in devices from wafer b was @xmath30 cm@xmath28/vs while that from wafer c was @xmath32 cm@xmath28/vs .",
    "wafers b and c were grown on the same day , so it appears likely that the decrease in mobility can be attributed to the change in heterostructure design .",
    "that being said , it has become clear in recent years that the zero field mobility is not a good predictor of energy gaps in the 2@xmath13 ll @xcite .",
    "consequently , it was necessary to examine the magnetotransport at low temperature to make any definitive statement on the potential negative impact of moving the superlattice closer to the 2deg .",
    "ll in device a after illumination with a red led . during the first cool down of the sample ( red curves )",
    "the sample was mounted on a commercial ceramic chip carrier . at a gate leakage current ( power ) of @xmath2 63 pa ( 76 pw ) the electrons appear very warm as seen by the lack of riqhe features , despite a low mixing chamber temperature t@xmath33 . during the second cool down of the sample ( blue curves ) , the device was mounted on a homemade header with a copper strip screwed onto the end of the cold finger on the mixing chamber .",
    "the electrons were obviously much colder even for a slightly higher t@xmath33 .",
    "the green curve shows the transport around @xmath6 during the second cooldown for t@xmath33 = 51 mk . comparing the green and black data ,",
    "we conclude that the electron temperature was @xmath2 50 mk for t@xmath33 = 11 mk during the first cooldown.,width=288 ]    figure [ cooling ] illustrates the importance of minimizing the gate leakage and properly heat sinking the sample in order to study the 2@xmath13 ll at low temperatures ( t @xmath34 mk ) .",
    "the data shown were taken from an early device from wafer a which was fabricated prior to the final optimization of our processing recipe . during the first cool down of the device , the joule heating of the electrons due to the gate leakage current evidently caused the electron temperature to depart from the mixing chamber temperature t@xmath33 for a gate leakage current ( power ) @xmath2 4 pa ( @xmath2 3.5 pw ) as evinced by weakening of the reentrant integer quantum hall effect ( riqhe ) features ( data not shown ) .",
    "by contrast , the excitation current of 2.1 na contributed a neglible power dissipation of @xmath2 45 fw at @xmath6 . in order to facilitate wire bonding",
    ", we mounted the device on a commercial bondable ceramic chip carrier during the first cool - down .",
    "this meant , however , that the sample was only cooled through the 18 @xmath25 m thick au bond wires .",
    "to improve the heat sinking , we re - wired the same device on a homemade header . in this design",
    "the sample was mounted to a strip of cu with ag paint , and the cu strip was screwed directly onto the cu cold finger of the mixing chamber resulting in a continuous metal connection between the mixing chamber and sample . with this",
    "improved heat sinking , heating of the electrons was not evident until a gate leakage current ( power ) @xmath2 56 pa ( 67pw ) .",
    "figure [ cooling ] illustrates the vast improvement in electron temperature achieved by improving the heat sinking of the sample . for",
    "a fixed density and approximately constant gate leakage current , the data taken with the cu strip header show strong riqhe features while the data taken with the ceramic chip carrier shows no riqhe features . to quantify t@xmath35 during the first cool - down",

    "[ cooling ] ) taken at t@xmath33 = 51 mk during the second cooldown .",
    "the insulating peaks in r@xmath36 in the vicinity of @xmath6 at t@xmath33 = 51 mk during the second cool - down are comparable to those seen at t@xmath33 = 11 mk during the first cool - down .",
    "this allows us to estimate t@xmath37 50 mk for the black curves in fig .",

    "the riqhe states in device c ( from wafer c ) showed an interesting evolution with density as shown in fig .",
    "[ riqhe_all ] . in order to quantitatively",
    "compare the states , we defined the strength @xmath38 of the riqhe states as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the the classical hall resistance at the filling fraction of interest , @xmath41 is the actual hall resistance at the peak position , and @xmath42 is the resistance of the nearest integer hall plateau . using this definition , a fully quantized riqhe state has a strength of 1 while a completely absent state has a strength of 0 .",
    "figure [ riqhe_all ] shows the evolution of the riqhe states in device c during its second cool - down .",
    "the states on the high field side of @xmath6 , 2a and 2b ( @xmath43 2.29 and 2.42 , respectively ) , are seen to weaken over the measured density range while states 2c and 2d ( @xmath43 2.56 and 2.70 , respectively ) continue to strengthen .",
    "figure [ riqhe_2a ] shows a comparison of the evolution of state 2a in device c as a function of density for two different cooldowns .",
    "even though the power dissipation from the gate leakage varied by @xmath2 1 order of magnitude between the two cool - downs ( possibly due to slightly different illumination conditions ) , the data show the same trend .",
    "comparisons between the other three states for the two cool - downs show similar agreement .",
    "this appears to indicate that the observed evolution in strength is driven primarily by the 2deg density and not by heating from the gate leakage . at present , the origin of this behavior is not understood .",
    "regardless of the mechanism that causes states 2a and 2b to weaken with increasing density , this behavior is qualitatively different than that seen in states 2c and 2d and may point to a difference in the underlying localization mechanisms . in contrast , the strength of all the riqhe states in device b ( from wafer b ) with the larger superlattice setback ( data not shown ) were seen to increase with density up to a density ( power dissipation ) of @xmath44 @xmath5 ( 6.4 pw ) after which all the riqhe states weakened .",
    "while we can not identify the mechanisms that alter localization , it appears that the different proximity of the superlattice to the 2deg in wafers b and c has a significant impact .",

    "this extremely low power level serves to highlight the necessity of minimizing the gate leakage in order to study the 2@xmath13 ll .",
    "we now turn to the central result of our work .",
    "figure [ c_transport ] shows low temperature transport ( t@xmath33 @xmath2 10 mk ) at two different densities for device c after illumination with a red led .",
    "the device shows excellent transport with all four riqhe states present and well developed fqhe states at @xmath47 = 14/5 , 8/3 , 5/2 , and 7/3 .",
    "in addition , nascent states at @xmath48 and @xmath49 begin to develop at high density .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the first time these states have been observed in a back - gated device , and their presence in spite of their extreme fragility @xcite further points to the high quality of the 2deg .",
    "the presence of the state at @xmath48 is particularly interesting as this state has been proposed as a host of fibonacci anyons which could be used for universal topological quantum computation @xcite .",

    "figure [ gaps ] displays the gap at @xmath6 as a function of density for devices b and c. it is clear that , within the experimental resolution , the gaps are nearly identical for both devices at low density ( n @xmath51 @xmath5 ) .",
    "evidently , neither the day - to - day variation in the mbe growth conditions nor the uncontrolled sample degradation from device fabrication nor the proximity of the superlattice to the 2deg significantly affect the gap at @xmath6 .",
    "device c , however , allows investigation of much higher 2deg densities . moreover , the magnitude of the gaps are very large with the gap in device c reaching a maximum value of 625 mk , the highest reported to date , at a density of @xmath9 @xmath5 .",

[ gaps ] is that at the highest density measured the gap shows a pronounced drop .",
    "it has been previously reported @xcite that the gap at @xmath6 drops suddenly when the energy difference between the fermi energy e@xmath52 and the first excited electric sub - band in the quantum well equals the cyclotron energy . in this case",
    ", there is a level crossing and the ground state is pushed into the lowest ll of the anti - symmetric sub - band .",
    "figure [ subband ] shows the calculated @xcite energy spacing along with the cyclotron energy as a function of density .",
    "as expected , the experimentally measured gap at @xmath6 is seen to drop suddenly when the cyclotron energy becomes approximately equal to the gap between e@xmath52 and the second sub - band .",
    "taken together , our calculations and experimental data indicate that larger gaps at even higher densities could potentially be achieved if the quantum well were made more narrow to further separate the ground and excited sub - bands .",
    "to summarize , we have examined the effect of heterostructure design and device processing on the performance of _ in - situ _ back - gated 2degs in the 2@xmath13 ll .",
    "we found that the position of the gaas / alas superlattice barrier relative to quantum well has a large impact on the leakage characteristics of the device due to its effectiveness in blocking the diffusion of the ohmic contacts towards the gate and minimizing fowler - nordheim tunneling . moving the superlattice closer to",
    "the 2deg greatly increases the range of low - leakage gating without significantly degrading the strength of the gap at @xmath6 or other correlated states in the 2@xmath13 ll .",
    "in addition , we found that gate leakage dissipation powers as small as a few pw are sufficient to cause electronic heating that impacts transport in the 2@xmath13 ll . by improving the heat sinking of the lattice ,",
    "the acceptable power dissipation is increased to @xmath2 10 pw . moreover , it is likely that the fqhe gaps would continue to rise at higher density beyond what we report here if the electric sub - bands were spaced sufficiently far apart .",
    "thus , examining gaps as a function of density in narrower quantum wells could potentially yield important results on the density dependence of the gap at other states potentially useful for topological quantum computation such as @xmath48 .",
    "as we have demonstrated a robust recipe for these structures and as the fqhe states in the 2@xmath13 ll are very strong over a wide range of density , these devices should prove useful in experiments intended to test for the presence of non - abelian statistics in quantum hall systems .",
