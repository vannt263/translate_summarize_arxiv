    "one of the most important problems in mathematical finance is to know the probability distribution of speculative prices . in spite of its importance for both theoretical and practical applications",
    "the problem is yet unsolved .",
    "the first approach to the problem was given by bachelier in 1900 when he modelled price dynamics as an ordinary random walk where prices can go up and down due to a variety of many independent random causes .",
    "consequently the distribution of prices was gaussian  @xcite .",
    "the normal distribution is ubiquitous in all branches of natural and social sciences and this is basically due to the central limit theorem : the sum of independent , or weakly dependent , random disturbances , all of them with finite variance , results in a gaussian random variable .",
    "gaussian models are thus widely used in finance although , as kendall first noticed  @xcite , the normal distribution does not fit financial data specially at the wings of the distribution .",
    "thus , for instance , the probability of events corresponding to 5 or more standard deviations is around @xmath0 times larger than the one predicted by the gaussian distribution , in other words , the empirical distributions of prices are highly leptokurtic . is the existence of too many of such events , the so called outliers , the reason for the existence of  fat tails \" and the uselessness of the normal density specially at the wings of the distribution .",
    "needless to say that the tails of the price distributions are crucial in the analysis of financial risk .",
    "therefore , obtaining a reliable distribution has deep consequences from a practical point of view  @xcite .",
    "one of the first attempts to explain the appearance of long tails in financial data was taken by mandelbrot in 1963  @xcite who , based on pareto - lvy stable laws  @xcite , obtained a leptokurtic distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the price to pay is high : the resulting probability density function has no finite moments , except the first one .",
    "this is indeed a severe limitation and it is not surprising since mandelbrot s approach can still be considered within the framework of the central limit theorem , that is , the sum of independent random disturbances of infinite variance results in the lvy distribution which has infinite variance  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lvy distribution has been tested against data in a great variety of situations , always with the same result : the tails of the distribution are far too long compared with actual data . in any case , as mantegna and stanley have recently shown  @xcite , the lvy distribution fits very well the center of empirical distributions much better than the gaussian density and it also shares the scaling behavior shown in data  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we want to explain speculative price dynamics as a sum of weakly interdependent random disturbances , we are confronted with two different and in some way opposed situations .",
    "if we assume finite variance the tails are  too thin \" and the resulting gaussian distribution only accounts for a narrow neighborhood at the center of the distribution . on the other hand , the assumption of infinite variance leads to the lvy distribution which explains quite well a wider neighborhood at the center of distributions but results in  too fat tails \" .",
    "the necessity of having an intermediate model is thus clear and this is the main objective of the paper .    obviously ,",
    "since the works of mandelbrot  @xcite and fama  @xcite on lvy distributions , there have been several approaches to the problem , some of them applying cut - off procedures of the lvy distribution  @xcite and , more recently , the use of arch and garch models to obtain leptokurtic distributions  @xcite .",
    "the approaches based on cut - off procedures are approximations to the distributions trying to better fit the existing data , but they are not based on a dynamical model that can predict their precise features . on the other hand arch  @xcite and garch  @xcite models are indeed dynamical adaptive models but they do not provide an overall picture of the market dynamics resulting in a distinctive probability distribution .",
    "in fact , arch / garch models usually assume that the market is gaussian with an unknown time - varying variance so to be self - adjusted to obtain predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we propose the stochastic model and set the mathematical framework that leads to a probability distribution of prices . in sect .",
    "3 we present the main results achieved by the model .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "let @xmath1 be a random processes representing stock prices or some market index value .",
    "the usual hypothesis is to assume that @xmath1 obeys an stochastic differential equation of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the instantaneous expected rate of return and @xmath4 is a random process with specified statistics , usually @xmath4 is zero - mean gaussian white noise , @xmath5 , in other words @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wiener process or brownian motion . in this case , the dynamics of the market is clear since the return @xmath8 $ ] obeys the equation @xmath9 which means that returns evolve like an overdamped brownian particle driven by the  inflation rate \" @xmath3 and , in consequence , the return distribution is gaussian .",
    "let us take a closer look at the price formation and dynamics .",
    "following merton  @xcite we say that the change in the stock price ( or index ) is basically due to the random arrival of new information .",
    "this mechanism is assumed to produce a marginal change in the price and it is modelled by the standard geometric brownian motion defined above .",
    "in addition to this  normal vibration \" in price , there is an  abnormal vibration \" basically due to the ( random ) arrival of important new information that has more than a marginal effect on price .",
    "merton models this mechanism as a jump process with two sources of randomness : the arrival times when jumps occurs , and the jump amplitudes .",
    "the result on the overall picture is that the noise source @xmath4 in price equation is now formed by the sum of two independent random components @xmath10 where @xmath11 is gaussian white noise corresponding to the normal vibration , and @xmath12 is  shot noise \" corresponding to the abnormal vibration in price . this shot noise component can be explicitly written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dirac delta function , @xmath15 are jump amplitudes , and @xmath16 are jump arrival times .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are independent random variables with known probability distributions given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively  @xcite .",
    "we now go beyond this description and specify the  inner components \" of the normal vibration in price , by unifying this with merton s abnormal component .",
    "we thus assume that _ all changes in the stock price ( or index ) are modelled by different shot - noise sources corresponding to the detailed arrival of information _ , that is , we replace the total noise @xmath4 by the sum @xmath19 where @xmath20 are a set of independent shot - noise processes given by @xmath21 the amplitudes @xmath22 are independent random variables with zero mean and probability density function ( pdf ) , @xmath23 , depending only on a single  dimensional \" parameter which , without loss of generality , we assume to be the standard deviation of jumps @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 we also assume that the occurrence of jumps is a poisson process , in this case shot noises are markovian , and the pdf for the time interval between jumps is exponential : @xmath26 , \\label{psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 are mean jump frequencies , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28 is the mean time between two consecutive jumps  @xcite .",
    "finally , we order the mean frequencies in a decreasing way : @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the zero - mean return , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath31 . for our model @xmath30 reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the heaviside step function .",
    "our main objective is to obtain an expression for the pdf of @xmath30 , @xmath34 , or equivalently , the characteristic function ( cf ) of @xmath30 , @xmath35 , which is the fourier transform of the pdf @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath30 is a sum of independent jump processes , this allows us to generalize rice s method for a single markov shot noise to the present case of many shot noises  @xcite .",
    "the final result is @xmath36\\right\\}. \\label{7}\\ ] ] as it is , @xmath30 represents a shot noise process with mean frequency of jumps given by @xmath37 and jump distribution given by @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless , we make a further approximation by assuming ( i ) @xmath39 , _ i.e. _ , there is an infinite number of shot - noise sources , and ( ii ) there is no characteristic time scale limiting the maximum feasible value of jump frequencies , thus @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "both assumptions are based on the fact that the  normal vibration \" in price is formed by the addition of ( approximately ) infinitely many random causes , which we have modelled as shot noises . according to this ,",
    "we introduce a  coarse - grained \" description and replace the sum in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) by an integral @xmath42du\\right\\}. \\label{7a}\\ ] ] in order to proceed further we should specify a functional form for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we note by empirical evidence that the bigger a sudden market change is , the longer is the time we have to wait until we observe it .",
    "therefore , since @xmath43 decreases with @xmath45 ( recall that frequencies are decreasingly ordered ) then @xmath44 must increase with @xmath45 .",
    "we thus see that @xmath44 has to be a positive definite , regular and monotone increasing function for all @xmath45 .",
    "the simplest choice is : @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "there is empirical evidence of scaling properties in financial data  @xcite .",
    "we summarize the above requirements ( _ i.e. _ , inverse relation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and scaling ) by imposing the  dispersion relation \" : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the scaling parameter . under these assumptions",
    "the cf of the return @xmath30 reads : @xmath51dz\\right\\ } , \\label{11}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the maximum value of the standard deviation .",
    "we observe that if @xmath53 , which means that some shot - noise source has infinite variance , then eq .  (",
    "[ 11 ] ) yields the lvy distribution @xmath54 where @xmath55dz . \\label{levyk}\\ ] ] hence , if we want a distribution with finite moments , we have to assume a finite value for @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be the mean frequency corresponding to the maximum ( finite ) variance .",
    "recall that , in the discrete case ( _ c.f . _",
    "( [ 7 ] ) ) , shot - noise sources are ordered , thus @xmath57 and @xmath56 correspond to the mean frequency and the variance of the last jump source considered .",
    "our last assumption is that the total number of noise sources in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) increases with the observation time @xmath58 and , since @xmath39 , this implies that @xmath59 is an increasing function of time .",
    "consequently , the mean period of the last jump source , @xmath60 , also grows with @xmath58 .",
    "the simplest choice is the linear relation : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is constant .",
    "therefore , from the dispersion relation , eq .  (",
    "[ 00 ] ) , we see that the maximum jump variance depends on time as a power law : @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "we finally have @xmath65dz\\right\\ } , \\label{final}\\ ] ]",
    "let us now present the main results and consequences of the above analysis .",
    "first , the volatility of the return is given by @xmath66 which proves that @xmath67 and the volatility shows super - diffusion .",
    "the anomalous diffusion behavior of the empirical data ( at least at small time scales ) was first shown by mantegna and stanley without mention it  @xcite .",
    "second , kurtosis is constant and given by @xmath68 thus @xmath69 for all @xmath58 , in other words , we have a leptokurtic distribution in all time scales .",
    "third , the return probability distribution scales as @xmath70 and the model becomes self - similar  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the super - diffusion behavior .",
    "circles correspond to empirical data from s&p 500 cash index during the period january 1988 to december 1996 .",
    "solid line shows the super - diffusive character predicted by eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) setting @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( if time is measured in minutes ) .",
    "dashed line represents normal - diffusion @xmath73 . observe that data obeys super - diffusion for @xmath74 min , and when @xmath75 min there seems to be a  crossover \" to normal diffusion .",
    "= 12 cm    we finally study the asymptotic behavior of our distribution .",
    "it can be shown from eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) that the center of the distribution , defined by @xmath76 , is again approximated by the lvy distribution defined above . on the other hand the tails of the distribution",
    "are solely determined by the jump pdf @xmath77 by means of the expression @xmath78 therefore , return distributions present fat tails and have finite moments _ if jump distributions behave in the same way_. this , in turn , allows us to make statistical hypothesis on the form of @xmath77 based on the empirical form and moments of the pdf .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the probability density @xmath34 of the s&p 500 cash index returns @xmath30 observed at time @xmath79 min ( circles ) .",
    "@xmath80 is the standard deviation of the empirical data .",
    "dotted line corresponds to a gaussian density with standard deviation given by @xmath81 .",
    "solid line shows the fourier inversion of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) with @xmath71 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "we use the gamma distribution of the absolute value of jump amplitudes , @xmath84 with @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "dashed line represents a symmetrical lvy stable distribution of index @xmath71 and the scale factor @xmath87 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ levyk ] ) .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath56 and @xmath81 predict that the pareto - lvy distribution fails to be an accurate description of the empirical pdf for @xmath88 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) ) .",
    "= 12 cm    we chose a gamma distribution of jumps because ( i ) as suggested by the empirical data analized , the tails of @xmath34 decay exponentially , and ( ii ) one does not favor too small size jumps , _",
    "i.e. _ , those jumps with almost zero amplitudes . in any case , it would be very useful to get some more microscopic approach ( based , for instance , in a  many agents \" model",
    "@xcite ) giving some inside on the particular form of @xmath77 .",
    "summarizing , by means of a continous description of random pulses , we have obtained a dynamical model leading to a probability distribution for the speculative price changes .",
    "this distribution which is given by the following characteristic function : @xmath89dz\\right\\ } , \\label{last}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , it depends on three positive constants : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the characteristic function  ( [ last ] ) also depends on an unknown function @xmath93 , the unit - variance characteristic function of jumps , also to be conjectured and fitted from the tails of the empirical distribution .",
    "therefore , starting from simple and reasonable assumptions we have developed a new stochastic process that possesses many of the features , _",
    "i. e. _ fat tails , self - similarity , superdiffusion , and finite moments , of financial time series , thus providing us with a different point of view on the dynamics of the market .",
    "we finally point out that the model does not explain any correlation observed in empirical data ( as some markets seem to have  @xcite ) .",
    "this insufficiency is due to the fact that we have modelled the behavior of returns through a mixture of independent sources of white noise .",
    "the extension of the model to include non - white noise sources and , hence , correlations will be presented soon .",
