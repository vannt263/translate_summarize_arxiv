    "it has been confirmed admittedly that our universe is experiencing an accelerating expansion at the present time , by many cosmological experiments , such as observations of large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , searches for type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , and measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite .",
    "this cosmic acceleration observed strongly supports the existence of a mysterious exotic matter , dark energy , with large enough negative pressure , whose energy density has been a dominative power of the universe .",
    "the astrophysical feature of dark energy is that it remains unclustered at all scales where gravitational clustering of baryons and nonbaryonic cold dark matter can be seen .",
    "its gravity effect is shown as a repulsive force so as to make the expansion of the universe accelerate when its energy density becomes dominative power of the universe .",
    "the combined analysis of cosmological observations suggests that the universe is spatially flat , and consists of about @xmath1 dark energy , @xmath2 dust matter ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) , and negligible radiation .",
    "although we can affirm that the ultimate fate of the universe is determined by the feature of dark energy , the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remain enigmatic at present . however",
    ", we still can propose some candidates to interpret or describe the properties of dark energy .",
    "the most obvious theoretical candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath3 ( vacuum energy ) @xcite which has the equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "however , as is well known , there are two difficulties arise from the cosmological constant scenario , namely the two famous cosmological constant problems  the `` fine - tuning '' problem and the `` cosmic coincidence '' problem @xcite . the fine - tuning problem asks why the vacuum energy density today is so small compared to typical particle scales .",
    "the vacuum energy density is of order @xmath4 , which appears to require the introduction of a new mass scale 14 or so orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale .",
    "the second difficulty , the cosmic coincidence problem , says : since the energy densities of vacuum energy and dark matter scale so differently during the expansion history of the universe , why are they nearly equal today ? to get this coincidence",
    ", it appears that their ratio must be set to a specific , infinitesimal value in the very early universe .",
    "theorists have made lots of efforts to try to resolve the cosmological constant problem , but all these efforts were turned out to be unsuccessful .",
    "however , there remain other candidates to explaining dark energy .",
    "an alternative proposal for dark energy is the dynamical dark energy scenario .",
    "the cosmological constant puzzles may be better interpreted by assuming that the vacuum energy is canceled to exactly zero by some unknown mechanism and introducing a dark energy component with a dynamically variable equation of state .",
    "the dynamical dark energy proposal is often realized by some scalar field mechanism which suggests that the energy form with negative pressure is provided by a scalar field evolving down a proper potential .",
    "actually , this mechanism is enlightened to a great extent by the inflationary cosmology .",
    "as we have known , the occurrence of the current accelerating expansion of the universe is not the first time in the expansion history of the universe .",
    "there is significant observational evidence strongly supports that the universe underwent an early inflationary epoch , over sufficiently small time scales , during which its expansion rapidly accelerated under the driven of an `` inflaton '' field which had properties similar to those of a cosmological constant .",
    "the inflaton field , to some extent , can be viewed as a kind of dynamically evolving dark energy . hence , the scalar field models involving a minimally coupled scalar field are proposed , inspired by inflationary cosmology , to construct dynamically evolving models of dark energy . the only difference between the dynamical scalar - field dark energy and the inflaton is the energy scale they possess",
    ". famous examples of scalar - field dark energy models include quintessence @xcite , @xmath5-essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , phantom @xcite , ghost condensate @xcite and quintom @xcite , and so forth .",
    "generically , there are two points of view on the scalar - field models of dynamical dark energy .",
    "one viewpoint regards the scalar field as a fundamental field of the nature .",
    "the nature of dark energy is , according to this viewpoint , completely attributed to some fundamental scalar field which is omnipresent in supersymmetric field theories and in string / m theory .",
    "the other viewpoint supports that the scalar field model is an effective description of an underlying theory of dark energy . in any case , the scalar field dark energy models must face the test of cosmological observations .",
    "a typical approach for this is to predict the cosmological evolution behavior of the models , such as the evolution of equation - of - state or hubble parameter , by putting in the lagrangian ( in particular the potential ) by hand or theoretically , and to make a consistency check of models by comparing it with observations .",
    "an alternative approach is to start from observational data and to reconstruct corresponding theoretical lagrangian .",
    "it looks that the latter is more efficient to find out the best - fit models of dark energy from observations .",
    "the accumulation of the current observational data has opened a robust window for probing the recent dynamical behavior of dark energy .",
    "an intriguing aspect in the study of dark energy is that the analysis of the observational data of type ia supernova , mainly the 157 `` gold '' data listed in riess et al .",
    "@xcite including 14 high redshift data from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst)/great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) program and previous data , using the parametrization of hubble parameter @xmath6 or equation - of - state of dark energy @xmath7 , shows that the equation of state of dark energy @xmath8 is likely to cross the cosmological - constant boundary @xmath9 ( or phantom divide ) , i.e. @xmath8 is larger than @xmath9 in the recent past and less than @xmath9 today @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolving behavior of dark energy with @xmath8 getting across @xmath9 has brought forward great challenge to the model - building of scalar - field in the cosmology .",
    "the conventional scalar - field model , the quintessence with a canonical kinetic term , can only evolve in the region of @xmath10 , whereas the model of phantom with negative kinetic term can always lead to @xmath11 .",
    "neither the quintessence nor the phantom alone can realize the transition of @xmath8 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 or vice versa . although the @xmath5-essence can realize both @xmath12 and @xmath13 , it has been shown that it is very difficult for @xmath5-essence to achieve @xmath8 of crossing @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "hence , the quintom model was proposed for describing the dynamical evolving behavior of @xmath8 crossing @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the nomenclature `` quintom '' is suggested in the sense that its behavior resembles the combined behavior of quintessence and phantom .",
    "thus , a simple realization of quintom scenario is a model with the double fields of quintessence and phantom @xcite .",
    "the cosmological evolution of such model has been investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that such a quintom model would typically encounter the problem of quantum instability inherited from the phantom component .",
    "for the single real scalar field models , crossing @xcite .",
    "] the transition of crossing @xmath9 for @xmath8 can occur for the lagrangian density @xmath14 , where x is a kinematic term of a scalar - field @xmath15 , in which @xmath16 changes sign from positive to negative , thus we require nonlinear terms in @xmath17 to realize the @xmath0 crossing @xcite .",
    "when adding a high derivative term to the kinetic term @xmath17 in the single scalar field model , the energy - momentum tensor is proven to be equivalent to that of a two - field quintom model @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is remarkable that the generalized ghost condensate model of a single - real - scalar - field is a successful realization of the quintom - like dark energy @xcite . in ref.@xcite , a dark energy model with a ghost scalar field",
    "has been explored in the context of the runaway dilaton scenario in low - energy effective string theory .",
    "the authors addressed for the dilatonic ghost condensate model the problem of vacuum stability by implementing higher - order derivative terms and showed that a cosmological model of quintom - like dark energy can be constructed without violating the stability of quantum fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , a generalized ghost condensate model was investigated in refs.@xcite by means of the cosmological reconstruction program .",
    "for another interesting single - field quintom model see ref.@xcite , where the @xmath0 crossing is implemented with the help of a fixed background vector field . besides , there are also many other interesting models , such as holographic dark energy model @xcite and braneworld model @xcite , being able to realize the quintom - like behavior . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the generalized ghost condensate model and will reconstruct this model using various dark energy parametrizations and the up - to - date observational datasets .    this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : para ] we address the various dark energy parametrizations and describe the analysis results of the current experimental data of various astronomical observations . in section [ sec : ghost ]",
    "we perform a cosmological reconstruction for the generalized ghost condensate model from the dark energy parametrizations and the fitting results of the up - to - date observational data .",
    "finally we give the concluding remarks in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the distinctive feature of the cosmological constant or vacuum energy is that its equation of state is always exactly equal to @xmath9 . whereas , the dynamical dark energy exhibits a dynamic feature that its equation - of - state as well as its energy density are evolutionary with time .",
    "an efficient approach to probing the dynamics of dark energy is to parameterize dark energy and then to determine the parameters using various observational data .",
    "one can explore the dynamical evolution behavior of dark energy efficiently by making use of this way , although the results obtained are dependent on the parametrizations of dark energy more or less . among the various parametric forms of dark energy ,",
    "the minimum complexity required to detect time variation in dark energy is to add a second parameter to measure a change in the equation - of - state parameter with redshift .",
    "this is the so - called linear expansion parametrization @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , which was first used by di pietro @xmath20 claeskens @xcite and later by riess et al .",
    "however , when some `` longer - armed '' observations , e.g. cmb and lss data , are taken into account , this form of @xmath7 will be unsuitable due to the divergence at high redshift .",
    "a frequently used parametrization form of equation - of - state , @xmath21 , suggested by chevallier @xmath20 polarski @xcite and linder @xcite , can avoid the divergence problem effectively .",
    "it should be noted that this parametrization form has been investigated enormously in exploring the dynamical property of dark energy in the light of observational data .",
    "we shall summarize some main constraint results for this parametrization in the follows .",
    "a recently popular method of constraining the dark energy parametrization is the so - called `` global fitting '' which tries to make use of the most observational information including cmb , snia and lss data as well as to consider the dark energy perturbation , employing the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques . in the global fitting one",

    "@xcite extended their previous results in ref.@xcite and got the fit results as forrest ( sdss - lya ) @xcite data . ]",
    ": for with dark energy perturbation , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; for without dark energy perturbation , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "lately , riess et al .",
    "@xcite released the new `` gold '' dataset of 182 snia , in which the full sample of 23 snia at @xmath39 provides the highest - redshift sample known .",
    "in addition , it should be mentioned that the gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) have been , in some studies , processed as `` known candles '' due to some intrinsic correlations between temporal or spectral properties of grbs and their isotropic energies and luminosities .",
    "such investigations have triggered studies on using grbs as cosmological probes .",
    "the largest grb sample compiled by shaefer was released lately @xcite . in a recent work @xcite , for including the most observational information in the analysis of probing the dynamical dark energy , the authors added the grb data to the global fitting .",
    "their fit results can be summarized as : for with grb data , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; for without grb data , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "an alternative approach to constraining the dynamical dark energy parametrization is to use the measured value of the cmb shift parameter , together with the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sdss , and the snia data , which provides a more economical scheme comparing to the global fitting method .",
    "the cmb shift parameter @xmath46 is perhaps the least model - dependent parameter that can be extracted from cmb data , since it is independent of @xmath47 .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath46 is given by @xcite @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the redshift of recombination and @xmath50 .",
    "the value of the shift parameter @xmath46 can be determined by three - year integrated wmap analysis @xcite , and has been updated by wand @xmath20 mukherjee @xcite to be @xmath51 independent of the dark energy model .",
    "the measurement of the bao peak in the distribution of sdss luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) @xcite gives @xmath52 ( independent of a dark energy model ) at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is defined as @xmath55^{2/3}$ ] . here the scalar spectral index is taken to be @xmath56 as measured by the three - year wmap data @xcite .",
    "wang and mukherjee @xcite used this method and found the constraints on the linder parametrization : for riess04+wmap3+sdss , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; for astier05+wmap3+sdss , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "such results are qualitatively consistent with those of zhao et al .",
    "@xcite , with significant differences that may be explained by the differences in the combination of data used , and perhaps by some data analysis details .",
    "the aforementioned discussions are focussed on the linder parametrization of dark energy for the equation of state .",
    "besides the linder parametrization , there are also some other parametrization forms for the dark energy equation - of - state parameter , for instance , the form of @xmath61 @xcite . in addition , the parametrization for the hubble parameter @xmath6 is also often considered .",

    "these three forms of parametrization have lately been considered by gong @xmath20 wang @xcite . in addition",

    "the reconstruction for @xmath102 is plotted in fig.[fig : hphi ] , using the three parametrizations and the corresponding best - fit values of parameters from the observational data analysis of snia+cmb+lss .",
    "the differences between the shapes of @xmath102 comes from the differences in these forms of parametrization because that uncertainties still remain large for `` model - independent '' observational constrains of dynamical dark energy .",

    "we see that the differences in the shapes of @xmath113 are very little .",
    "it should be mentioned that the reconstruction of the generalized ghost condensate model has been carried out in ref.@xcite in the light of `` parametrization 3 '' from the best - fit results of the snia gold dataset @xcite .",
    "however , the constraints from only the 157 gold data of snia can only give very preliminary results @xcite : @xmath123 and @xmath124 , for the prior @xmath125 .",
    "it can be seen clearly that these results have significant differences from those derived from new observational data analysis .",
    "so our result of reconstruction significantly improves the previous result .",
    "in addition , as has been pointed out by tsujikawa @xcite , it should be cautioned that the perturbation of the field @xmath15 is plagued by a quantum instability whenever it behaves as a phantom @xcite . even at the classical level",
    "the perturbation becomes unstable for @xmath126 , because that the speed of sound , @xmath127 , will become negative .",
    "this instability may be avoided if the phantom behavior is just transient .",
    "in fact the dilatonic ghost condensate model can realize a transient phantom behavior ( see , e.g. , fig.4 in ref.@xcite ) . in this case",
    "the cosmological - constant boundary crossing occurs again in the future , after which the perturbation will become stable .",
    "nevertheless , one may argue that the field can be regarded as an effective one so as to evade problems such as stability . in particular , the present focus is that how to establish a dynamical scalar - field model on phenomenological level to describe the possible dynamics of dark energy observed , disregarding the field is fundamental or not .",
    "in this paper , we have reconstructed the ghost condensate scalar - field model in the light of three forms of parametrization for dynamical dark energy with fit results of observational data for the parameters .",
    "the analysis of the data of astronomical observations suggests that dark energy may possess dynamical nature , i.e. the energy density as well as the equation of state are likely to exhibit dynamical evolution property during the expansion history of the universe .",
    "furthermore , it is intriguing that recent analysis of observational data , especially the `` gold '' snia data , shows that the equation - of - state parameter of dark energy may , with some possibility , cross the cosmological - constant boundary @xmath0 during the evolution of the universe .",
    "although the scalar - field models of dark energy , such as quintessence and phantom , can provide us with dynamical mechanism for dark energy , the behavior of cosmological - constant crossing brings forward a great challenge to the model - building for dynamical dark energy , because neither quintessence nor phantom can realize this manner .",
    "the model of quintom was suggested to realize this behavior by means of the incorporation of the features of quintessence and phantom .",
    "the generalized ghost condensate model provides us with a successful single - real - scalar - field model for realizing the quintom - like behavior . for probing the dynamical nature of dark energy",
    ", one should parameterize dark energy first and then constrain the parameters using the observational data . in this paper",
    ", we reviewed the recent constraint results for various parametrization forms .",
    "based upon three forms of parametrization for dynamical dark energy , @xmath21 , @xmath61 and @xmath75^{1/2}$ ] , with the best - fit values of parameters , we perform a reconstruction for the generalized ghost condensate model .",
    "the results of reconstruction show that there are some differences in the various forms of parametrization .",
    "on the other hand , it should be noted that the cosmological constant will be more favored than a dynamical dark energy when the snls supernova dataset is considered instead of the `` gold '' one ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "this statement has become even stronger after the recent appearance of the essence dataset @xcite .",
    "however , though the cosmological constant receives support from the snls+essence dataset , the dynamical dark energy can not be ruled out yet . actually , it is difficult to reach firm conclusion on the property of dark energy from these data until strong model - independent analysis can be carried out .",
    "the increase of the quantity and quality of observational data in the future will undoubtedly provide a true _ model - independent _ manner for exploring the property of dark energy .",
    "we hope that the future high - precision observations ( e.g. snap ) may be capable of providing us with deep insight into the nature of dark energy driving the acceleration of the universe .",
