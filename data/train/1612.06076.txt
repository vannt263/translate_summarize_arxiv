    "standard perturbation theory does not work very well for large interaction terms , because usually it produces divergent series @xcite .",
    "the standard approach is to use various summation techniques to extract answers from these divergent series @xcite , although it has not been shown yet , that this is always possible @xcite .",
    "the method described in this paper is interesting , as it presents a different way of approaching the problem .",
    "we will first describe the method and derive it from the standard perturbation theory .",
    "we will see , that in some cases , this method is faster then conventional numerical method , variational principle . then we will calculate the efficiency of the algorithm and reformulate it in a new and faster way .",
    "the results are examined with two examples : 1 .",
    "anharmonic oscillator with large quartic term .",
    "we will compare our results to the results calculated through other techniques ; 2 .",
    "using infinite well as unperturbed problem , we will numerically calculate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for poschl - teller potential . as both ,",
    "unperturbed and perturbed problems are analytically solvable , this will allow us to compare the numerical and analytical solutions .",
    "the method described in this paper is a numerical generalisation of perturbation theory .",
    "the perturbation theory can be applied to the problems , which differ from some exactly solvable problem by a `` small '' term .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it allows the difference to be any finite term .",
    "the main idea is that we can divide the perturbation term by a large number @xmath0 and then perturb the initial solution step by step @xmath0 times using the obtained small perturbation .",
    "this is actually a simplification of the real idea . to be more specific , the above explanation",
    "compares to the euler method for solving odes , whereas the real algorithm allows for using the runge - kutta - fehlberg or any other convenient method .",
    "we can write the ordinary perturbation theory in the following form    @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6    where @xmath7 represents the hamiltonian of the solvable system ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath10th eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the given hamiltonian ; @xmath11 is the perturbed hamiltonian and @xmath12 is the perturbation term ; naturally @xmath13 and @xmath14 are @xmath10th eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the perturbed hamiltonian .",
    "we have obtained all the information about the eigenstates of the perturbed hammiltonian , now we can apply the same method once more and perturb the hamiltonian a bit more . in general we can use the method as many times as we want . if we take @xmath15 where @xmath0 is a large integer and use the perturbation theory @xmath0 times , finally we will arrive at the solution for @xmath16 .",
    "the recurrent form of the equations is as follows    @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the hamiltonian after @xmath23 iterations and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "let us now expand the eigenfunctions @xmath25 in basis of eigenfunctions of the initial hamiltonian    @xmath26    in case of degeneracy the basis should be chosen in such a way , that the perturbed hamiltonian would be diagonal in this degenerate subspace . in other words , the degeneracy is resolved using standard approach .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath27 .",
    "now we will rewrite the equations ( [ psidiscrete])-([psidiscreteder ] ) using equation ( [ expansiondiscrete ] ) .",
    "the matrix element of perturbation term would be    @xmath28    using equations ( [ ediscrete ] ) , ( [ ediscreteder ] ) and ( [ matrixelement ] ) , we obtain    @xmath29    substituting ( [ psidiscreteder ] ) , ( [ expansiondiscrete ] ) and ( [ matrixelement ] ) into ( [ psidiscrete ] ) and multiplying the result by some @xmath30 we obtain    @xmath31    now instead of a discrete @xmath23 we introduce a continuous variable @xmath32 which takes values from 0 to 1 .",
    "each value of @xmath32 corresponds to a different hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "the small variable @xmath34 is changed to @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to show that equations ( [ endiscretefinal ] ) and ( [ qndiscretefinal ] ) can be rewritten as a set of first order differential equations    @xmath36    @xmath37    so it is reduced to an initial value problem , with initial conditions @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the sums here can be thought of as generalized sums ( including integration ) , if the spectrum of unperturbed hamiltonian has continuous part too .",
    "the equations ( [ dife ] ) and ( [ difq ] ) contain infinite sums . in order to calculate the approximate values for them ,",
    "the immediate approach is to only consider first @xmath0 terms and neglect the others .",
    "if we take big enough @xmath0 , the approximation will differ from the real infinite sum by a small term . on the other hand , in contrast to variational principle , to calculate perturbation for @xmath10th eigenstate , with large number @xmath10 , one does not need to consider all the eigenstates smaller then @xmath10 .",
    "it is enough to consider @xmath0 neighbouring eigenstates and neglect others , as the contribution of @xmath41th eigenstate ( @xmath42 ) on the perturbation of the @xmath10th eigenfunction is inversely proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "for large enough @xmath10 , this method will be faster than conventional variational method .    a possible way to control",
    "the error of calculations is to use a suitable acceleration technique on the sums .",
    "one should calculate the results using standard sums and afterwards calculate more precise results using accelerated sums .",
    "the absolute value of difference between these two should be of the same order as the error of the calculations involving the standard sums .",
    "in this section we will estimate and improve the efficiency of the algorithm .    to proceed with this method , first of all",
    ", we will have to prepare the @xmath44 matrix elements .",
    "if we consider @xmath0 eigenstates , this calculations will take @xmath45 operations .",
    "although the rest of the algorithm has higher asymptotic time in terms of @xmath0 , these operations involve integration , and for some practical problems might be the slowest part of the calculations .",
    "after this , in the process of solving the odes ( [ dife ] ) and ( [ difq ] ) , we will have to evaluate the right hand sides of the equations .",
    "each evaluation of the equation ( [ dife ] ) will take @xmath45 operations , as it involves double sum over @xmath0 terms .",
    "we will have to calculate derivatives for @xmath0 eigenvalues , thus the energies will take @xmath46 operations altogether .",
    "now let us estimate the number of operations needed to evaluate ( [ difq ] ) .",
    "there are @xmath0 eigenstates , each eigenfunction has @xmath0 components .",
    "thus there are @xmath47 @xmath48 coefficients .",
    "if you implement the formulae right away , each calculation will require @xmath46 operations , as it involves triple sum , and altogether , @xmath48s will use @xmath49 operations , which would be slow .    to improve the algorithm",
    ", we need to rewrite the equation ( [ difq ] ) in the following way    @xmath50",
    "@xmath51    @xmath52    each element of @xmath53 requires @xmath54 operations , thus for the whole @xmath53 , it will be @xmath46 .",
    "each element of @xmath55 will take @xmath54 operations and the whole @xmath55 will need @xmath46 .",
    "after this , we have @xmath55 and calculation of each @xmath56 will only take @xmath54 operations , altogether @xmath46 again . therefore , the whole process will take @xmath57 operations , which is a great improvement .",
    "one should note , that @xmath0 here is not the largest number of eigenstate , but rather the total number of eigenstates considered .    to accelerate the algorithm even more",
    ", one could make use of parallel programming : calculate each term of the sum in parallel , then summ by pairs in parallel again and so on recursively . in this case",
    "the number of required consecutive operations would be of order @xmath58 .",
    "in this example we are going to introduce a quartic term in the hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator .",
    "this has become a standard test case for similar purposes .",
    "@xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61    knowing the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed problem , we calculate the matrix elements @xmath44 and then solve equations ( [ dife ] ) and ( [ difq ] ) numerically using runge - kutta - fehlberg method , taking into account only first 30 eigenstates .",
    "figure [ anharmonicfig ] represents the comparisonof our results to the values calculated by j. e. drummond using technique to sum the divergent series @xcite .",
    "our method reproduced every digit in the table 3 given in @xcite .",
    "energy vs @xmath32 for first five eigenstates .",
    "the lines are results obtained with this method .",
    "the points correspond to the values calculated by j. e. drummond @xcite . ]      in this example we will use our method to perturb infinite well solutions with poschl - teller potential and obtain the eigenstates for it .",
    "this example has been chosen because there exist analytical solutions for both , unperturbed and perturbed systems and because the perturbation term is obviously not small .",
    "@xmath62    @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65    for these expressions we numerically solve equations ( [ dife ] ) and ( [ difq ] ) much like the previous example . in these calculations 30 eigenstates were considered . in figure [ tellerfig ]",
    "you can see the dependence of first five eigenvalues on the @xmath32 parameter .",
    "the errors are larger for the eigenstates close to upper limit .",
    "having equation ( [ expansiondiscrete ] ) and knowing values @xmath66 , we can reconstruct the eigenfunctions for any given value of @xmath32 ( see figure [ tellereigenfig ] ) .",

    "perturbation theory stays an important tool for approximately solving problems in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it plays a very important role for example in in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "we have modified the eigenvalue problem to become an initial value problem , which can be solved approximately using any standard techniques for solving a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this method , in some cases has a better efficiency than the conventional variational method .",
    "the method has been tested for anharmonic oscillator and the results matched the ones obtained in publication @xcite through different technique .",
    "another test was to start with one analytically solvable system ( infinite well problem ) , add to the hamiltonian a term to turn it into another analytically solvable system ( particle in poschl - teller potential ) .",
    "the results matched in this case too .",
    "therefore we can say , that we have derived a method to approach eigenvalue problems with finite perturbation terms of any order .",
