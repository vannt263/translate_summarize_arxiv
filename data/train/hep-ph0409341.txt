    "now however , fixing the form of the effective lagrangian from an exact low - energy limit of qcd seems to be out of our reach and the alternative has been to propose simple effective lagrangians @xcite and rely on a few nucleons properties to set the parameters they depend on . from that point of view ,",
    "a rather stringent test for such models lies in whether they could accurately describe the data for the electromagnetic form factors of nucleons for moderate values of momentum transfer .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors of the semiclassically quantized su(2 ) skyrmion were studied systematically by braaten et al @xcite but this first attempt did not take into account relativistic kinematical corrections which are important for momentum transfers @xmath1 gev@xmath2 these correction were implemented to the original skyrme model predictions by holzwarth @xcite using the prescription of ji @xcite .",
    "actually , holzwarth also  introduced a second correction to the skyrme model to account for vector meson effects either by introducing a multiplicative factor to reflect the contributions of the poles coming from these mesons , or by adding the vector mesons as dynamical degrees of freedom in the lagrangian . yet , in spite of remarks and suggestions in @xcite , no analysis regarding how higher - order lagrangians could reproduce the nucleon electromagnetic form factors or conversely , how the form factors could help construct a more accurate effective lagragian .    in this work",
    ", we calculate the electromagnetic form factors for a class of higher - order ( skyrme - like ) models introduced in @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we limit our numerical analysis to one and two - parameter models with a proper treatment of relavistic effects , and evaluate to what extent the experimental data of the electromagnetic form factors of proton can suggest a form of higher - order lagrangians or discriminate among possible candidates .",

    "the electromagnetic form factors of the proton in the breit frame , for spacelike momentum transfer @xmath59 , are the fourier transforms of its electric charge and magnetic moment densities : @xmath60@xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 \\label{eq : den_inertie}%\\ ] ] are the baryon density and moment of inertia density respectively . here",

    "unfortunately , the boost transformations ( [ eq : ge_rel ] ) and ( [ eq : gm_rel ] ) violate the so - called superconvergence rule @xmath79 which is expected to hold for electromagnetic form factors . indeed",

    "however for the models under study here , this procedure turned out to be unsatisfactory . the value of @xmath35 ensuring superconvergence caused the ratio of the electromagnetic form factors to become too suppressed in the large-@xmath85 limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the models which we propose as candidates for the description of qcd at low energy are not expected to hold for large values of @xmath86 since the superconvergence rule seems to be too restrictive , it will not be applied here .",
    "we will instead promote @xmath35 as parameter and adjust its value to provide a better fit of high-@xmath85 data .",
    "the parameters of the skyrme model , @xmath7 and @xmath87 are usually set with either one of the following two methods : ( i ) adjust @xmath7 and @xmath4 to obtain the mass of the nucleons ( 939 mev ) and of the @xmath88 resonance ( 1232 mev ) or ( ii ) set @xmath4 according to its experimental value ( 186 mev ) and adjust @xmath7 to reproduce the nucleon-@xmath88 mass split ( 295 mev ) . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we adopt the second method also used in @xcite and assume that the pion mass takes its physical value .",
    "we consider here two simple extensions of the skyrme model that fall into the class of models described in section [ sec : all ] @xmath89 model a adds a single term ( and a single parameter @xmath90 ) of order six in derivative of the field  to the skyrme model whereas model b which depends on two additionnal parameter has a rational form which hopefully could allow to reproduce poles due to vector mesons .",
    "this latter model is a generalization of a model introduced by jackson et al @xcite with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "fixing the model parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 as well as the scale parameter @xmath35 is a tedious procedure which requires a few steps : first , we choose a set of parameters ( @xmath90 for model a or @xmath95 and @xmath94 for model b ) and solve the differential equation ( [ eq : gen_eom ] ) for massive pions and use the method described above ( inputs are @xmath4 and nucleon-@xmath88 mass split ) to fit for the appropriate value of @xmath96 in the second step , we compute the form factors , compare them with data and adjust @xmath35 to minimize the @xmath97 of the ratio of the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated with different sets of parameters until we get the configuration @xmath98 or @xmath99 with lowest @xmath100    the results for the electromagnetic form factor are presented in fig .",

    "the problem originate to their inability to mimic the pole coming from the vector mesons . computing these predictions for an arbitrary number of skyrme model extensions being prohibitive",
    ", we resort to another approach @xcite .",
    "the @xmath114 meson effects are incorporated by multiplying the form factors ( [ eq : fac_e ] ) and ( [ eq : fac_m ] ) by @xmath115 with @xmath116 = 770 mev . the electromagnetic mean square radii of proton then become @xmath117@xmath118 this correction introduced an additional parameter whose allowed values go from the purely pionic model ( @xmath119 ) to the mesonic dominance ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the parameter @xmath121 does not have any effect on the ratio of the electromagnetic form factors . a similar effect",
    "could also be included to take into account the @xmath122 meson effects , but corresponding factor would involve a second @xmath121 parameter and our calculations indicates that this additionnal factor does not leads to noticeable amelioration of the behavior .",
    "figure [ fig : modab ] presents the electromagnetic form factors as obtained from model a and b with pole effects introduced through ( [ eq : lamb ] ) .",
    "all the models parameters as well as the parameters @xmath35 and now @xmath121 are fitted using the procedure described above to minimize the @xmath97 of the magnetic form factor .",

    "furthermore , as shown in table [ tab : results ] , the addition of higher orders terms have little effect on other static properties of the proton with these choice of parameters ( note that the magnetic moment of proton predicted by the models are all lower than its experimental value but one has to remember that these properties are subject to quantum corrections @xcite ) .",
    "the values of @xmath121 indicate a strong dominance of the @xmath114 meson as in @xcite .",
    "our results therefore indicates that the data are best reproduced by a higher - order effective lagrangian in the low - energy limit of qcd .",
    "unfortunately , as we have noticed , the determination of a more acurate effective lagrangian faces theoretical uncertainties which remain to be addressed .",
    "first , the boost prescription ( [ eq : ge_rel ] ) and ( [ eq : gm_rel ] ) , not being compatible with superconvergence , prevents us from reproducing results for @xmath133 .",
