    "figure  6 shows the dependence of the normalized theshold frequency @xmath123 at which @xmath124 .",
    "it is instructive that the obtained dependences exhibit maxima at certain values of the ballistic parameter @xmath71 ( not at @xmath101 as one might expect ) .",
    "moreover , the height of these maxima decreases with increasing parameter @xmath32 , which characterizes the collisional broadening ( see sec .",
    "the effect of the dependence of the threshold frequency @xmath125 on parameters @xmath71 and @xmath32 can be attributed to the following .",
    "first , at the ballistic electron transport , the frequency dependence of @xmath126 is actually determined not only by the characteristic transit time @xmath127 but also by the thermal spread in the electron velocities  @xcite .",
    "the latter is about the thermal electron velocity @xmath128 .",
    "the scattering of electrons , particularly strongly dependent on the electron momentum , can influence the effective spead in velocities .",
    "indeed , when @xmath129 , i.e. , when the low - energy electrons ( with small @xmath130 ) exhibit rather strong scattering , their contribution to the current decreases with simultanious decrease in the effective spead in velocities .",
    "this can be seen , in particular , from eq .",
    "( 7 ) in which the asymmetric part of the distribution function @xmath49 is @xmath131 . since the term @xmath132 sharply increases when @xmath21 tends to zero , this function can be fairly small in the range of small @xmath130 ( especially at small @xmath32 ) , while at large @xmath130 it tends to the maxwellian function .",
    "this implies that , the momentun distribution can shrink and the velocity spread can decrease due to specific feature of the electron scattering in gnrs .",
    "a significant increase in the threshold frequency can be achieved if the directional electron velocity markedly exceeds the thermal velocity .",
    "this can occur in gnr - fets with the gnrs with varied widths ( increasing from the source - side edge of the top gate to its drain - side ) and the pertinent decrease in the energy gap .",
    "in such hetero - gnrs , the electrons can accelerate propagating from the source to drain ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as was mentioned above , factor @xmath106 associated with the electron transit - time effects in the region between the top gate and drain contact depends on the transit angle @xmath133 and the form - factor @xmath109 .",
    "figure  7 shows the frequency dependence of @xmath114 for the following two cases : ( a ) @xmath134 and ( b ) @xmath135}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "the form - factor ( a ) can be attributed to the case when the drain contact is rather bulk , so that the source - drain ac current is induced primarily in this contact ( not in the highly conducting portion of the channel adjacent to the drain contact ) .",
    "the form - factor ( b ) corresponds to the case when the ac current is induced mostly in the highly conducting region or when the drain contact is a blade - like .",
    "both such cases can take place depending on the spacing , @xmath136 , between the top gate and the drain contact and the bias voltages @xmath2 and @xmath4 . at @xmath105 , the region of the channel between the top gate and the drain contact",
    "is virtually depleted .",

    "7 . as seen from fig .  7",
    ", @xmath114 markedly drops with increasing transit angle @xmath133 when the latter exceeds unity .",
    "this effect is not important if the frequency - dependent gnr - fet transconductance is mainly limited by the electron delay under the top gate , i.e. , if @xmath139 .",
    "however , at @xmath140 , the net transconductance is determined by the product of @xmath141 and @xmath114 corresponding to curves shown in fig .  4 and fig .  7 , respectively .",
    "\\(1 ) we proposed an analytical device model for a gnr - fet based on a heterostructure which consists of an array of nanoribbons clad between the highly conducting substrate ( the back gate ) and the top gate .",
    "\\(2 ) using this model , we derived explicit analytical formulas for the gnr - fet transconductance as a function of the signal frequency in wide ranges of the collision frequency of electrons and the top gate length .",
    "\\(3 ) the variation of the gnr - fet high - frequency characteristics due to the transition from the ballistic and to strongly collisional electron transport was traced .",
    "it was shown that the threshold frequency can nonmonotonically depend on the ballsitic parameter .",
