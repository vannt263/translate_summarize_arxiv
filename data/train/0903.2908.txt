    "as the @xmath3ising model of intrinsically hard combinatorial satisfaction problems , the random @xmath0-satisfiability ( @xmath0-sat ) problem was extensively studied in the last twenty years .",
    "recent major progresses include mean - field predictions and rigorous bounds on the satisfiability threshold @xcite , mean - field predictions on various structural transitions in the solution space of a random @xmath0-sat formula @xcite , and new efficient stochastic algorithms @xcite . statistical physics theory @xcite predicted that the solution space of a satisfiable random @xmath0-sat formula ( @xmath4 ) divides into exponentially many gibbs states as the constraint density is beyond a clustering ( dynamic ) transition point . for @xmath5",
    "it was proved @xcite that the solution space gibbs states are extensively separated from each other , but whether the same picture holds for @xmath6 is still an open question .",
    "recent empirical studies revealed that for random @xmath0-sat formulas with @xmath7 the clustering transition has no fundamental restriction on the performances of some stochastic search algorithms such as walksat and chainsat @xcite .",
    "for example , the chainsat process @xcite is able to find solutions for a random @xmath2-sat formula with constraint density well beyond the clustering transition value , although during the search process the number of unsatisfied constraints of the formula never increases .",
    "the most efficient stochastic algorithm for large random @xmath0-sat formulas is survey propagation @xcite which , for the random @xmath1-sat problem , is able to find solutions at constraint densities extremely chose to the satisfiability threshold . to understand the high efficiency of these and other stochastic search algorithms",
    ", it is desirable to have more detailed knowledge on the energy landscape and the solution space structure of the random @xmath0-sat problem ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for some very recent efforts ) .",
    "such knowledge will also be very helpful for designing new stochastic search algorithms .",
    "a random @xmath0-sat formula contains @xmath8 variables and @xmath9 clauses , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) being the constraint density .",
    "each variable has a spin @xmath12 , and each clause prohibits @xmath0 randomly chosen variables from taking a randomly specified spin configuration of the @xmath13 possible ones . the configurations @xmath14 that satisfy a formula @xmath15 forms a solution space .",

    "two solutions @xmath20 and @xmath21 are regarded as nearest neighbors if they differ on just one variable , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "the organization of the solution space can be studied graphically by representing each solution as a vertex and connecting every pair of unit - distance solutions by an edge .",
    "then the solution space can be regarded as a collection of solution clusters , each of which is a connected component of the solution space in its graphical representation .",
    "how many solution clusters does this astronomically huge graph contain ? what is the size distribution of these clusters ?",
    "what are the distributions of the minimal , the mean , and the maximal distances between two clusters ?",
    "how are the solutions in each cluster organized ?",
    "these questions are fundamental to a complete understanding of the random @xmath0-sat problem , but they are very challenging and so far only few rigorous mathematical answers are achieved @xcite .",
    "mean - field statistical physics theory @xcite is able to give a prediction on the number of solution gibbs states of a given size , but whether there is a strict one - ton - one correspondence between solution gibbs states , which are defined according to statistical correlations of the solution space @xcite , and solution clusters is not yet completely clear .",

    "the internal structure of a solution cluster is explored by unbiased and biased random walk processes .",
    "we examine mainly solution clusters reached by a very slow belief propagation decimation algorithm , but it appears that the qualitative results are the same for solution clusters reached by various other algorithms .",
    "we can verify that the studied solution clusters correspond to the single ( statistically relevant ) gibbs state of the given formulas if the constraint density @xmath10 is lower than @xmath23 , the clustering transition point where exponentially many gibbs states emerge @xcite .",
    "we find that the solutions in such a giant cluster already aggregate into many different communities when @xmath10 is still much lower than @xmath23 . in a solution cluster ,",
    "solutions of the same community are more densely connected with each other than with the other solutions , and the mean hamming distance of solutions belonging to the same community is shorter than the mean solution - solution hamming distance of the whole cluster .",
    "the entropy density of a solution community is calculated by the replica - symmetric cavity method of statistical physics and is found to be different for different communities of the same cluster .",
    "when the constraint density exceeds @xmath23 , we have the same observation that non - trivial community structures are present in the single solution clusters reached by several stochastic search algorithms .",
    "these numerical results are interpreted in terms of the following proposed evolution picture of the solution space of a random @xmath0-sat formula : ( 1 ) as the number of constraints of the formula increases and @xmath10 becomes close to @xmath23 from below , many relatively densely connected solution communities emerge in the solution spaces and these communities are linked to each other by various inter - community edges ; ( 2 ) the intra- and inter - community connection patterns both evolve with @xmath10 , and finally the single giant component of the solution space breaks into many clusters of various sizes ( probably at @xmath24 ) , each of which contains a set of communities ; ( 3 ) as @xmath10 further increases , the intra- and inter - community connection patterns in each solution cluster keep evolving , leading to the breaking of a solution cluster into sub - clusters .",
