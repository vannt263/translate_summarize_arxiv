    "the level of complexity achieved by today s integrated electronic systems is commonly perceived as the result , primarily , of challenging technological efforts to scale device dimensions down to their ultimate physical limits @xcite .",
    "although this is indeed true , it is only partially responsible for their success , as miniaturization is not synonymous with large scale integration .",
    "in fact analog electronic circuits can not function properly without adequate tools to dynamically steer and hold each embedded device to the desired working point , counteracting functional drifts due to fluctuations in the environment , aging effects , mutual crosstalk , and fault events @xcite .",
    "this argument is directly applicable to photonic technologies .",
    "even though photonic platforms , like silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) , have demonstrated the maturity for squeezing several thousands of photonic elements in a footprint of less than 1 mm@xmath0 @xcite , the evolution of integrated photonics from device level to large scale systems is still a challenge .",
    "in fact , when aggregating several components on a single chip , the aforementioned parasitic effects become critical and need to be addressed through feedback control loops that locally monitor and continuously set each optical element to the desired functionality @xcite .",
    "these issues are particularly severe in si photonics microresonators , because of their extreme sensitivity to fabrication tolerances @xcite and temperature variations @xcite .",
    "several approaches have been recently proposed to lock the resonant wavelength of si microrings , for instance by applying dithering signals @xcite or homodyne detection schemes @xcite , and by monitoring the power level @xcite or the bit - error - rate @xcite of the optical signal .",
    "however , all the techniques proposed so far require the use of on - chip or external photodetectors to partially tap the light travelling in the resonator . though effective on single devices ,",
    "this approach is not scalable to large scale integration circuits @xcite , where multi - point light tapping would incur in a large amount of optical power wasted for monitoring operation .",
    "local feedback control assisted by transparent optical detectors is envisioned as an enabling tool for the realization of complex and arbitrarily reconfigurable systems - on - a - chip @xcite .    here",
    ", we show a si photonic - electronic integrated platform enabling the feedback control of si photonics integrated circuits without the need of tapping any photon from the waveguide .",
    "the status of high quality factor resonators is monitored by a recently pionereed contactless integrated photonic probe ( clipp ) @xcite , that realizes a fully transparent detector and can be integrated directly inside any photonic circuit , including microrings .",
    "the feedback loop , combining the clipp read - out system and the microring control functions , is entirely integrated onto an electronic cmos circuit @xcite that is wire - bonded to the si photonics chip .",
    "advanced functionalities and control operations , such as wavelength tuning , locking , labeling and swapping are demonstrated in a thermally actuated resonator , proving that the presented si photonic - electronic integrated platform is an efficient and flexible solution for the realization and control of si photonics circuits hosting many components .",

    "the metallic nicr heaters and au pads of the clipp are patterned by lift - off technique , and placed at sufficient distance from the si core to avoid any significant absorption of the optical mode by the metal .",
    "the clipp is constituted simply by the two 100 @xmath2 m long metal electrodes placed on top of the microring waveguide , here mutually spaced by about 83 @xmath2 m on the side of the bus - to - ring directional coupler .",
    "the clipp can be fabricated by using any cmos - compatible metal technology , and can exploit traditional processes used for the fabrication of thermal actuators , without requiring any additional or specific process step .    the equivalent electrical circuit of the clipp is reported in fig .",

    "the clipp monitors variations of the waveguide electric conductance @xmath8 with optical power @xmath9 , that are induced by a carrier generation effect , occurring at the native si / sio@xmath3 interface , associated to intrinsic surface - state - absoption ( ssa ) processes @xcite .",
    "these phenomena exist even in ideally smooth interfaces because of the termination of the si lattice at the walls of the waveguide core @xcite .",
    "no specific treatment is performed on the si core surface .",
    "the clipp is essentially a non - invasive observer of the local power propagating in an optical waveguide @xcite , and therefore can be easily utilized in any applications requiring to monitor the light travelling in a photonic circuit ( see sec .",

    "in addition , it is worth noticing that , thanks to its intrinsic non - perturbative nature , the clipp can be placed in any point of the circuit to monitor its local status without affecting its functionality .",
    "the clipp observes directly the amount of light stored in the resonant cavity , information that traditionally is not available unless a portion of the optical power is tapped and rerouted to a photodetector , by measuring variations of the electric conductance @xmath6 of the waveguide core @xcite .     measured by the clipp , and corresponding estimated optical power , as a function of wavelength , when the thermal actuator is off ( blue line ) and then switched on at @xmath10 = 2 , 3 , 4 v ( red , green , and orange lines ) .",

    "the electric read - out frequency of the clipp is typically around @xmath12 = 1 mhz in order to bypass the capacitances @xmath16 and access directly the waveguide conductance @xmath6 , whereas the amplitude of the applied signal is usually @xmath13 = 1 v , so that neither attenuation nor significant perturbation of the optical mode is induced , and without affecting the quality factor of the resonator @xcite .",

    "we utilize the clipp to monitor the optical intensity in the microring , and the thermal actuator to adjust its resonant wavelength based on a feedback error signal provided by the clipp . in particular , we employ a common dithering technique @xcite , according to which a small modulation signal is applied to the resonator , and then , by mixing it with the modulated intracavity optical intensity measured by the clipp , an error signal is extracted and used to drive the feedback loop [ as shown in the schematic of fig .

    "@xmath29 drift apart from each other , the resonant optical power drops and the error signal deviates from zero .",
    "consequently , the voltage applied to the heater is updated with an increment proportional to @xmath21 , its sign indicating the direction to follow ( heating or cooling ) , and thus restoring the alignment between @xmath24 and @xmath29 .    the feedback loop is implemented by means of an integral controller , whose gain @xmath30 depends on the magnitude of @xmath21 with respect to the wavelength detuning @xmath11 [ fig .",

    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the optical intensity in the microring , measured by the clipp as a function of time , when the feeback routine is on ( blue lines ) and off ( red lines ) , in presence of a detuning of @xmath29 by 50 pm ( about the same of the resonator linewidth , and corresponding to a temperature variation of 0.7 k ) , i.e. approximately at the edges of its full linewidth . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) an instantaneous wavelength shift is imposed by the laser : the optical intensity in the resonator drops as @xmath29 is changed , but then is rapidly brought back ( here in about 150 ms ) to its initial level ( where @xmath29 and @xmath24 overlap ) by the feedback loop ( blue line ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) , instead , the feedback loop compensates for a continuous wavelength sweep of the laser : no significant variation in the resonant optical intensity is observed ( blue line ) along the entire wavelength detuning ( here occurring in about 700 ms ) , having @xmath29 and @xmath24 always locked one to another by the feedback control .",
    "the beneficial effect of the feedback loop is confirmed when the control is switched off ( red lines ) : in fact in both cases , as @xmath29 shifts , the optical intensity in the resonator drops and is never compensated , having the laser wavelength completely outside of the resonator linewidth .",
    "although the speed of the control loop here achieved is enough to well counteract most of the drifts ( thermal and others ) experienced by si photonics microrings , it can be significantly increased either with suitable control laws ( such as proportional or proportional - integral ) or by enlarging the clipp read - out bandwidth .",
    "for instance , while keeping the current clipp bandwidth ( around 1 khz ) , if a proportional controller with gain of few thousands is utilized , a loop with time constant down to hundreds of @xmath17s is achieved , yet at the price of larger voltage variations at the thermal actuator . on the other side , while maintaining an integral controller , the loop frequency can be increased by using a larger clipp bandwidth , yet at the price of larger noise ( though typically depending on the square root of the bandwidth ) .",
    "although the clipp is in general a broadband light observer , here we show that it is able to monitor and discriminate simultaneously optical signals at different wavelengths . to this aim",
    "we inject in the microring two different signals with wavelengths @xmath33 = 1549.59 nm and @xmath34 = @xmath33 + 120 pm , labeled respectively with red and green arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . a weak modulation tone , with depth 2@xmath35 , is added to label each of the optical carriers by means of an external modulator .",
    "the tone centered around @xmath33 has frequency @xmath36 = 10 khz , whereas the other one , that is centered around @xmath34 , has frequency @xmath37 = 11 khz ( the tones are labeled respectively with red circle and green triangle in fig . [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "the optical intensity observed in the resonator by the clipp is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] as a function of the electrical power dissipated by the heater .",
    "when the clipp electrical signal is demodulated at the usual frequency @xmath12 = 1 mhz , the intracavity optical intensity reports two peaks associated to the transmission of both signals @xmath33 and @xmath34 [ blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) ] , that are therefore indistinguishable .",
    "vice versa , if the read - out operations are performed at frequency @xmath12+@xmath36 = 1.010 mhz , the clipp is able to identify the signal at @xmath33 , where the modulation tone at frequency @xmath36 is added .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig5](b ) with red line , the resonant peak measured by the clipp is centered on the first signal ( red arrow ) , whereas no evidence of @xmath34 is found ( green arrow ) .",
    "similarly , if the electric signal is demodulated at frequency @xmath12+@xmath37 = 1.011 mhz , the measured resonant peak is centered on the second signal ( green arrow ) , that is identified by the clipp as wavelength @xmath34 .",
    "it is straightforward now to tune and lock the microring resonant wavelength to that of the first signal @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and then easily swap it to that of the second signal @xmath34 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noticing that wavelength swapping operations can be performed by the clipp simultaneously on an arbitrarily large number of wavelengths by using several modulation tones and by suitably demodulating the different signals , on signals at the same wavelength but different light polarizations @xcite , and on higher order modes in waveguides exploiting mode - division multiplexing schemes @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated non - invasive monitoring and advanced control functionalities in si photonics microring resonators , assisted by a fully transparent light detector directly integrated inside the cavity . through a cmos microelectronic circuit",
    "@xcite bridged to the si photonics chip , the resonant wavelength of the microring is automatically tuned and locked against wavelength drifts of the optical signal .",
    "the non - invasive nature of the clipp enables real - time inspection of the intra - cavity light intensity without affecting the quality factor of the resonator .",
    "furthermore , the clipp is able to monitor and discriminate signals , at different wavelengths , simultaneously resonating in the microring , thus enabling wavelength swapping operations . in the fabricated devices ,",
    "feedback control is achieved through thermal actuators , but the proposed tuning and locking schemes , and the clipp concept itself , can be adopted with any available actuator technology .    finally , the compactness and the scalability of cmos electronics to multi - channel read - out systems and the transparency of the clipp enable not only multipoint on - chip monitoring @xcite , but also the realization and control of photonic integrated circuits hosting many components and complex systems - on - a - chip .",
