    "heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) at high energies are studied both experimentally and theoretically to obtain information about the properties of dense and hot matter since in the hadronic phase the quarks are confined to a colour - neutral state , whereas at high densities and temperatures the partons can move freely over larger distances ( i.e. larger than the size of a hadron ) , which implies that the partons are deconfined and a new stage of matter - denoted as quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp)- is reached .",
    "such extreme conditions were present shortly after the creation of the universe and nowadays can be realized in the laboratory by heavy - ion collisions at relativistic energies .",
    "indeed , in the last decade the qgp has been produced in a sizeable volume in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and at the large hadron collider at the conseil europen pour la recherche nuclaire ( cern ) for a few fm / c after the initial impact of the collision .    unlike early predictions that assumed a weakly interacting system of massless partons ( parton gas ) , which might be described by pqcd ( perturbative quantum - chromo - dynamics ) , experimental observations of au+au collisions at rhic @xcite",
    "have shown clear signatures of a new medium that is more strongly interacting than in the hadronic phase and behaves approximately close to an ideal liquid . in order to study the properties of such qgp",
    "matter one looks for probes which provide information about the initial partonic stage . in the experiment",
    "only the final hadrons , leptons and photons are measured . in spite",
    "that electromagnetic probes allow to penetrate directly to all stages of heavy - ion collisions , they are very rare and it is quite complicated to identify the qgp signal among many other production channels of hadronic origin @xcite . on the other hand , hadronic observables are more abundant and easier to access experimentally .    apart from heavy hadrons with charm @xcite also strange vector - meson resonances @xmath4s are considered as sensitive probes for the hot and dense medium @xcite . at relativistic energies the @xmath5s are generally expected to be produced at the partonic freeze - out ( or even earlier @xcite ) and , thus , to provide information about the qgp stage close to hadronization .",
    "accordingly , detailed studies of the @xmath6 resonances have been performed by the star collaboration at rhic in the last decade @xcite . since the strange vector - mesons @xmath4s are relatively short living resonances , dominantly decaying to pions and kaons ( @xmath7 ) , it is difficult to reconstruct them experimentally since the pions and kaons suffer from final state interactions with other mesons and baryons in the expanding hadronic phase , i.e. the latter can rescatter or be absorbed . moreover",
    ", the recreation of the @xmath5 by fusion of a kaon and pion ( @xmath8 ) might over - shine the @xmath1 signal from the qgp and lead to additional complications . as known from chiral models or coupled - channel g - matrix approaches @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 resonances change their properties in a hot and dense hadronic medium and also the properties of the daughter kaons / antikaons are affected by hadronic in - medium modifications @xcite .",
    "all these effects should be accounted for when addressing or modelling the @xmath1 production in relativistic hics .    in order to interpret the experimental results",
    "@xcite it is mandatory to study the dynamics of the @xmath6s within a proper theoretical framework . statistical or hydrodynamic models can be used to obtain information on the bulk properties of the medium , however , to properly investigate the interactions of the @xmath6 with the hadronic medium one needs a non - equilibrium transport approach to study the influence of the medium on the @xmath6 and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , one needs a consistent theory for the in - medium effects of the @xmath6 as a function of the nuclear baryon density in order to trace the dynamics of the @xmath6 during the later stages of the collision in the expansion of the hadronic fireball in close analogy to the kaon and antikaon dynamics in heavy - ion reactions at lower energies @xcite .",
    "previously there have been several studies on the strange vector - meson resonances @xmath6 within different transport models at relativistic energies . in refs . @xcite detailed calculations for pb+pb at @xmath9  gev",
    "have been performed using the cascade model urqmd and it was found that the observability of strange particle resonances is distorted due to the rescattering of the strongly interacting decay products . furthermore , the rescattering rate changes with rapidity and transverse momentum @xmath10 of the reconstructed resonances , which leads to higher apparent temperatures for these resonances due to a sizeable depletion at low @xmath10 which is most pronounced at midrapidity . since the rescattering increases with baryon density ,",
    "most resonances that can be reconstructed come from the low nuclear baryon density region .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used epos3 ( optionally with urqmd as an afterburner ) to investigate the hadronic resonance production and interaction in pb+pb collisions at @xmath11  tev and compared their results to data from the alice collaboration .",
    "their calculations reproduce the data very well for the different centralities .",
    "the simulation also showed that a large part of the resonances at low @xmath10 can not be reconstructed due to the final state interactions of their decay daughters .",
    "our goal is to investigate the dynamics of @xmath6 vector - meson resonances using the parton - hadron - string dynamics transport approach @xcite employing the in - medium effects of the @xmath6s from the self - consistent coupled - channel unitary g - matrix approach for the production of @xmath6s from the hadronic channels as well as from a qgp by microscopic dynamical hadronization .",
    "the in - medium effects have been already successfully used to model the off - shell behaviour of the kaons @xmath12 and antikaons @xmath13 at finite nuclear baryon density in refs .",
    "previously , we have evaluated within this framework the properties of the strange vector resonances as a function of the nuclear baryon density @xcite and now incorporate the off - shell behaviour of the @xmath6s in form of a relativistic breit - wigner spectral function into phsd .",
    "we recall that the phsd transport approach incorporates the hadronic and partonic degrees - of - freedom and their interactions , dynamical hadronization and further off - shell dynamics in the hadronic stage which allows to include in a consistent way in - medium effects for hadrons as well as partons .    throughout this paper",
    "we will follow the following convention : when addressing strange vector mesons consisting of an anti - strange quark , i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 we will refer them as @xmath16 ; while for mesons with an anti - strange quark , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath18 we will use notation as @xmath19 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : phsd ] we shortly recall the phsd transport approach and its implementations beyond the cascade level . in section [ sec : ksmed ] we discuss the @xmath6 vector - meson resonance in - medium effects ; the first part describes the calculation of the in - medium effects using the g - matrix model while the second part contains the implementation of these effects into the phsd . in section [ sec : ksphsd ] we then investigate the properties and the dynamics of the @xmath6 vector - meson resonances in the phsd for au+au collisions at the top rhic energy , analyze the different production channels , the actual baryon densities explored as well as the in - medium effects of the @xmath1 spectral functions . in section [ sec : results ] we present our results in comparison to experimental data ; the first part shows a comparison for p+p collisions while the second part contains a detailed confrontation with experimental data from the star collaboration for a+a collisions including in particular the effect of acceptance cuts .",
    "finally , we give a summary of our findings in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) is a non - equilibrium microscopic transport approach @xcite that incorporates hadronic as well as partonic degrees - of - freedom .",
    "it solves generalised ( off - shell ) transport equations on the basis of the off - shell kadanoff - baym equations @xcite in first - order gradient expansion .",
    "furthermore , a covariant dynamical transition between the partonic and hadronic degrees - of - freddom is employed that increases the entropy in consistency with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the hadronic part part is equivalent to the hsd transport approach @xcite which includes the baryon octet and decouplet , the @xmath20 and @xmath21 meson nonets and higher resonances .",
    "when the mass of the hadrons exceeds a certain value ( @xmath22  gev for baryons and @xmath23  gev for mesons ) the hadrons are treated as strings ( or continuum excitations ) that decay to hadrons within a formation time of @xmath24 0.8 fm / c using the lund string decay @xcite . in phsd the partonic , or the qgp phase ,",
    "is based on the dynamical quasi - particle model ( dqpm ) @xcite which describes the properties of qcd ( in equilibrium ) in terms of resummed single - particle green s functions . instead of massless partons",
    "the gluons and quarks in phsd are massive strongly - interacting quasi - particles whose masses are distributed according to spectral functions ( imaginary parts of the complex propagators ) .",
    "the widths and pole positions of the spectral functions are defined by the real and imaginary parts of the parton self - energies and the effective coupling strength in the dqpm is fixed by fitting respective lqcd results from refs .",
    "@xcite ( using in total three parameters ) .    in the beginning of the nucleus - nucleus collision",
    "the lund string model @xcite is used to create colour neutral strings from the initial hard nucleon scatterings , i.e. the formation of two strings takes place through primary nn collisions .",
    "these early strings dissolve into massive coloured quarks and anti - quarks in their self - generated mean - field as described by the dqpm @xcite if the energy density is above the critical energy density @xmath25  @xmath26 in line with lqcd @xcite . if the energy density is below critical the strings decay to pre - hadrons ( as in case of p+p reactions or in the hadronic corona ) .",
    "the qgp phase is then evolved by the off - shell transport equations with self - energies and cross sections from the dqpm .",
    "when the fireball expands the probability of the partons for hadronization increases close to the phase boundary ( crossover at all rhic energies ) , the hadronisation takes place using covariant transition rates and the resulting hadronic system is further on governed by the off - shell hsd dynamics incorporating ( optionally ) self - energies for the hadronic degrees - of - freedom @xcite .",
    "thus in the phsd approach the full evolution of a relativistic heavy - ion collision , from the initial hard nn collisions out of equilibrium up to the hadronisation and final interactions of the resulting hadronic particles , is described on the same footing .",
    "we recall that this approach has been sucessfully employed for p+p , p+a and a+a reactions from about @xmath27 = 8 gev to 2.76 tev ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "in this study we will concentrate on the strange resonance dynamics mainly at rhic energies where the phsd describes well the bulk observables , i.e. rapidity , @xmath10-spectra , @xmath28 coefficients etc . @xcite .",
    "before coming to actual results from phsd for p+p and a+a collisions at relativistic energies we describe in some detail the evaluation of the kaon , antikaon and @xmath1 selfenergies as a function of baryon density and their implementation in the phsd . the medium properties and the off - shell propagation of the strange vector - meson resonances @xmath6 and @xmath29",
    "are based on the `` g - matrix '' approach from refs .",
    "we use this approach to calculate the self - energy of the @xmath6 and @xmath29 which we then implement in the form of relativistic breit - wigner spectral functions into phsd to model the in - medium effects and off - shell propagation of the @xmath6 and @xmath29 within a transport approach .      in recent years",
    "some efforts have been undertaken to assess the interaction of vector mesons with baryons in coupled - channel effective field approaches . in refs .",
    "@xcite vector mesons are introduced within the hidden local symmetry approach @xcite and a tree - level vector - meson baryon @xmath30-wave scattering amplitude is derived as the low - energy limit of a vector - meson exchange mechanism . in ref .",
    "@xcite the interaction of vector mesons with baryons is obtained on the basis of a @xmath31 spin - flavor symmetry extension of standard @xmath32 meson - baryon chiral perturbation theory , leading to a generalized ( @xmath30-wave ) weinberg - tomozawa interaction between the pseudoscalar / vector meson octets and the octet and decuplet of baryons .",
    "these two models share a crucial feature , namely , several @xmath33 and hyperon resonances are dynamically generated in a broad range of energies upon unitarization of the leading order ( lo ) , tree - level amplitudes .",
    "such states are indicative of non - trivial meson - baryon dynamics and one may expect an impact on the in - medium properties of strange vector mesons .",
    "incidentally , the properties of vector mesons within these approaches were initially investigated for the case of the @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the self - energy of the @xmath35 meson was also updated recently along the same ideas in @xcite .",
    "the absence of baryonic resonances with @xmath36 close to threshold induces milder nuclear medium effects in the properties of the @xmath12 meson @xcite as compared to the @xmath37 meson , whose behaviour is largely dominated by the @xmath38 resonance appearing in @xmath30-wave @xmath39 scattering .",
    "a similar situation takes place for the vector partner of the @xmath12 , the @xmath1 meson . note",
    "that the @xmath1 decays predominantly into @xmath40 , and therefore not only collisional effects but its in - medium decay width has to be taken into account ( we come back to this point below ) .",
    "however , since the @xmath12 meson itself is barely influenced by nuclear matter one can anticipate small changes in @xmath41 as compared to the vacuum case .",
    "an effective lagrangian approach , as developed in @xcite , was used in our previous study @xcite to calculate the @xmath1 meson self - energy at threshold energy . in this approach",
    ", the interaction between the octet of light vector mesons and the octet of @xmath42 baryons is built within the hidden local gauge symmetry ( hls ) formalism , which allows to incorporate vector meson interactions with pseudoscalar mesons respecting the chiral dynamics of the pseudoscalar meson - meson sector .",
    "the interactions of vector mesons with baryons are assumed to be dominated by vector - meson exchange diagrams , which incidentally allows for an interpretation of chiral lagrangians in the meson - baryon sector as the low - energy limit of vector - exchange mechanisms naturally occurring in the theory .",
    "vector - meson baryon amplitudes emerge in this scheme at leading order , in complete analogy to the pseudoscalar - meson baryon case , via the self - interactions of vector - meson fields in the hls approach . at small momentum transfer",
    "( i.e. , neglecting corrections of order @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the baryon mass ) , the lo @xmath30-wave scattering amplitudes have the same analytical structure as the ones in the pseudoscalar - meson baryon sector ( weinberg - tomozawa interaction ) , namely    @xmath45    where @xmath46  ( @xmath47 ) stands for the energy of the incoming  ( outgoing ) vector meson with polarisation @xmath48  ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 stand for channel - dependent symmetry coefficients @xcite , and the latin indices label a specific vector - meson baryon ( @xmath51 ) channel , e.g. , @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath1 collisional self - energy follows from summing the forward @xmath53 scattering amplitude over the allowed nucleon states in the medium , schematically @xmath54 . due to the absence of resonant states nearby ,",
    "a @xmath55 approximation is well justified at energies sufficiently close to threshold , which leads to the practical result ( take @xmath56 here )    @xmath57    with @xmath58 , leading to a positive mass shift ( equivalent to a repulsive optical potential ) of about @xmath59  mev at normal matter density @xmath60  @xmath61 ( recall @xmath62 ) . replacing the lowest order tree level amplitudes @xmath63 in the former result by unitarized amplitudes in coupled channels ( solving the bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath64 )",
    "one finds a reduction by roughly one third over the previous result , namely @xmath65  mev [ i.e. @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kstar - trho ] ) ] .",
    "further medium corrections on the vacuum scattering amplitudes @xmath67 , leading to a full @xmath68-matrix calculation , are of marginal relevance in the present case due to the mild corrections introduced by the smoothly energy - dependent @xmath69 interaction - matrix for the in - medium effective meson - baryon @xmath70-matrix obtained in dirac  brueckner theory .",
    "@xcite ] .    in the case of the @xmath71 ,",
    "the collisional part of the selfenergy , related to the quasi - elastic reaction @xmath72 and accounting for absorption channels , induces a strong broadening of the @xmath71 spectral function as a result of the mixing with two @xmath73 states , the @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are dynamically generated in the hidden local symmetry approach in a parallel way to the @xmath39 interaction and the @xmath76 .",
    "such complicated many - body structure of the @xmath77 interaction requires a detailed analysis of medium corrections such as pauli blocking on baryons and a self - consistent evaluation of the in - medium @xmath77 scattering amplitude ( @xmath68-matrix ) and the @xmath71 selfenergy , as was done in @xcite . for the present study we recourse to a suitable parameterization of the resulting @xmath71 self - energy and spectral function , which we discuss in more detail below .",
    "as mentioned before , the decay with of the @xmath78 meson ( with suitable medium corrections ) has to be taken into account to realistically assess production and anihilation rates .",

    "* the decay products of the @xmath1 mesons - final pions and kaons - suffer from partly resonant final state interactions which lead to a significant distortion of the @xmath1 spectra .",
    "the low transverse momentum @xmath10 part is most sensitive to these loses of kaon - pion correlations while the high @xmath10 @xmath1 mesons are less affected .",
    "that is in line with the conclusions from the previous studies @xcite .",
    "* at rhic energies most of the @xmath1 s are produced at relatively low baryon densities due to the rapid expansion of the fireball , thus in - medium effects in the hadronic phase are small at these energies . with decreasing beam energy , the fraction of the hadronic phase and its duration increases , which leads to the fact that the @xmath1 mesons probe much high baryon densities . in this respect",
    "the future fair and nica facilities are optimally set up to study in - medium @xmath1 resonance dynamics . *",
    "the differences in the slope of the @xmath10 spectra from various channels is small ( cf .",
    "[ fig : d2n2piptdptdyvspt_kspm ] ) which makes it difficult to distinguish experimentally the `` origin '' of @xmath1 mesons by applying different cuts e.g. on transverse momentum . *",
    "the restriction of the invariant mass region for the possible reconstructed @xmath1s leads to a further sizeable distortion of the @xmath1 signal and artificially enhance the effective slope parameter of the @xmath10 or @xmath193 spectrum . *",
    "the number of @xmath6s that can be reconstructed from final pions and kaons is heavily reduced in comparison to the number of @xmath6s that have been produced during a heavy - ion collisions ; especially it applies to the @xmath1 s produced and decayed at the early stages of heavy - ion collision , whereas the number of reconstructable @xmath6s in the later stages is much closer to the number of @xmath6s that have been produced due to the fat that the system expands rapidly and the final state interaction is less probable .",
    "furthermore , we mention that the dominance of final hadronic channels in the strange vector - meson channel is in line with our findings for the dilepton production from non - strange @xmath94 and @xmath35 decays in these reactions @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the strange vector meson ( @xmath0 ) dynamics in relativistic heavy - ion collisions based on the microscopic parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) transport approach which incorporates partonic and hadronic degrees - of - freedom , a phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter - quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) - and a dynamical hadronization of quarks and antiquarks as well as final hadronic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the role of in - medium effects on the @xmath0 meson dynamics by employing breit - wigner spectral functions for the @xmath1 s with self - energies obtained from a self - consistent coupled - channel g - matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we confront the phsd calculations with experimental data for p+p , cu+cu and au+au collisions at energies up to @xmath2  gev . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that at relativistic energies most of the final @xmath1s ( observed experimentally ) are produced during the late hadronic phase , dominantly by the @xmath3 channel , such that the fraction of the @xmath1s from the qgp is small and can hardly be reconstructed from the final observables . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the in - medium effects on the @xmath1 dynamics at rhic energies is rather modest due to their dominant production at low baryon densities ( but high meson densities ) , however , it increases with decreasing beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the additional cut on the invariant mass region of the @xmath1 further influences the shape and the height of the final spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this imposes severe constraints on the interpretation of the experimental results . </S>"
