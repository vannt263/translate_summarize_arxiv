    "in r - parity conserving supersymmetric models sparticles are produced in pairs at the collision point , then decay in cascades , resulting in a number of standard model particles as well as two lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps ) , one for each primary sparticle .",
    "if the lsps leave the detector without a trace , as is the case in most scenarios of this type , the event can not be fully reconstructed .",
    "this in turn prevents a direct measurement of the sparticle masses from mass peaks .",
    "the foreseen way to obtain these masses in such scenarios , is through endpoint measurements of invariant mass distributions @xcite .",
    "particularly suited is the cascade decay @xmath0 which for a large share of susy models and parameters is kinematically allowed and appears at a rate sufficient for study .",
    "four invariant mass distributions can be constructed from the visible decay products , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for events with @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding endpoint measurements however usually involve large errors . although relevant , such distributions have not been considered in this study . ] .",
    "once the endpoints have been measured , the masses can be found .",
    "however , measuring an endpoint is not trivial .",
    "a fit must be made to the edge region of the distribution .",
    "such a fit necessarily involves a signal and a background hypothesis .",
    "if these are not in good correspondence with the true shapes , it is expected that the endpoint fitting may introduce large systematic uncertainties .",
    "while a straight - line hypothesis sometimes performs well , the fact that each distribution can take on a large variety of shapes @xcite really is a limiting factor , especially since a mismeasurement of an endpoint by 10  gev can easily multiply to 40  gev in the resulting masses . without an appropriate signal hypothesis",
    "the endpoint method is incomplete .",
    "the many studies undertaken so far reflect this in that they have mainly focused on determining the statistical error , which can be fairly well estimated by a straight line , putting off the systematics of the fitting procedure for later investigations . with the recent advent of an analytic description of the shapes of these mass distributions @xcite ,",
    "the time for such investigations has come closer .",
    "the completion of the endpoint method requires formulas for the edge - region part of the distributions expressed by the endpoints .",
    "the shape formulas are however written in terms of the sparticle masses .",
    "fitting the distributions gives the masses directly without any recourse to the endpoints .",
    "the considerable difference in approach asks for a comparison between the two methods .",
    "we here investigate the matter for the msugra point sps  1a @xcite . in order for the characteristics of the methods to easily shine through ,",
    "we make a simple comparison , with no background included , and no detector effects . the comparison is based on histograms generated randomly from the shape formulas taken from @xcite convoluted with a gaussian of width 2  gev for @xmath1 and 10  gev for the other distributions .",
    "the selected procedure and numbers mimic the effect of sparticle widths , initial and final - state radiation , detector effects etc .",
    "the same procedure is also invoked for the shape - fitting process .",
    "the normalisation of the histograms corresponds roughly to the ultimate statistics expected for an lhc experiment .",

    "the nominal endpoint values are used , not the fitted ones . from these figures",
