    "the term _ doughnut nuclei _ was coined by j. a. wheeler @xcite many years ago . in 1970 s and 80 s the idea of a toroidal geometry in nuclear physics was investigated in a framework of the liquid drop model ( ldm ) and shell corrections @xcite . in 1990",
    "s @xcite and more recently @xcite the toroidal breakup configurations were found in the simulations of heavy - ion collisions using the boltzmann - nordheim - vlasov ( bnv ) or the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) kinetic transport models .",
    "the stability of toroidal nuclei against a change of the quadrupole moment was studied recently in the hartree - fock - bogolibov ( hfb ) theory @xcite with the gogny d1s force @xcite and in the semiclassical extended thomas - fermi ( etf ) method @xcite with the skyrme skm * force @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the stability of toroidal super - heavy nuclei against collective deformations within the self - consistent constraint skyrme - hartree - fock+bcs framework ( shf+bcs ) with the skyrme skm * force @xcite .",
    "since the classical ldm and semiclassical etf approaches do not include shell effects , we would like to examine quantitatively the role of the shell effects in the description of toroidal nuclei .",
    "the hf+bcs equations were solved using the code hfodd @xcite that uses the basis expansion method in a three - dimensional cartesian deformed ho basis .",
    "the details of our model are the same as in ref .",
    "in topology , the genus of a closed surface is equal to the number of handles on the surface . for instance",
    ", a torus is a surface with genus=1 while a sphere or disc has genus=0 .",
    "the shape of a toroidal nucleus can be characterized by an aspect ratio @xmath1 , where the major radius @xmath2 is measured from the center of the toroid to the center of the circular meridian and the minor radius @xmath3 is the radius of the meridian .",
    "assuming axial symmetry and a uniform mass distribution we can calculate a quadrupole moment @xmath4 for a given aspect ratio @xmath1 as @xmath5 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the toroidal coordinates @xcite @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8  is a spherical radius of the same volume @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the potential energy curves for toroidal nuclei with 114@xmath10z@xmath10138 calculated within the ldm @xcite .",
    "the potential energy curves are plotted as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath4 in the panel a ) and b ) , respectively .",
    "as one can see all toroidal super - heavy nuclei ( genus=1 ) show an oblate deformation with @xmath0 -200 b. in addition , as the atomic number z exceeds 138 , the genus=1 equilibrium lies at an energy even lower than that for the spherical shape .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we display the total binding energy ( @xmath11 ) calculated within shf+bsc approach as a function of the quadrupole moment @xmath4 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 super - heavy nuclei .",
    "the two branches of @xmath11 corresponding to a compact ( genus=0 ) and a toroidal ( genus=1 ) shf+bcs solutions have been found .",
    "both solutions coexist in the vicinity of @xmath16 -200 b. but with the further increase of the oblate deformation it becomes energetically favourable to change the genus of nuclear surface from 0 to 1 , i.e. , to switch the shape from a biconcave disc to a torus . for @xmath17 -250",
    "b only genus=1 self - consistent solutions exist .",
    "we also show the self - consistent density distributions obtained for both branches with the compact and toroidal topology . since the shf+bcs model is not restricted to the axial symmetry , the toroidal density distributions show the characteristic sausage deformations @xcite .",
    "the sausage instability is responsible for a multifragmentation of toroidal nuclei and in the case of @xmath12 and @xmath13 the toroidal solutions cease to exist at @xmath16 -450 b.    similarly to the ldm results showed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the genus=1 and genus=0 total energy minima become closer in energy with increasing atomic number z and mass number a. for z=138 and a=364 the toroidal equilibrium again begins to be the global minimum .",
    "the neutron fermi energies ( @xmath18 ) oscillate around -6 mev with a change of quadrupole deformation for all nuclei from fig .",
    "the proton fermi energies ( @xmath19 ) stronger depend on @xmath4 .",
    "for the prolate deformations @xmath19 oscillate between -2 and -1 mev but in the region of oblate deformation @xmath19 decreases to the value of @xmath18 at @xmath16 -400 b. thus , the toroidal shf+bcs solutions are more stable against @xmath20-decay than the compact ( genus=0 ) solutions .    in conclusion",
    ", it appears that our self - consistent shf+bcs calculations for the toroidal nuclei are consistent with the classical ldm @xcite and semiclassical etf @xcite models as well as with the hfb theory @xcite .",
    "the toroidal nuclear density distribution is not a surprising phenomenon , but a regular characteristic of the strongly oblate deformed heavy and super - heavy nuclei .",
    "the doughnut shaped nuclei are not the exception but rather the norm in this region of deformations !    one of us ( a.s ) would like to thank m. warda for interesting discussions which led to this investigation .",
