    "much of our knowledge of the galactic halo is based directly upon observations of its globular clusters , the most readily identifiable halo objects .",
    "those clusters which are located in the outer halo of the milky way are especially important probes of the formation and evolution of the galaxy , as their ages and metallicities provide direct constraints on the duration of halo formation process and on the time - scale for galactic chemical enrichment , while the shape and extent of galaxy s dark halo is constrained by their orbital properties .",
    "these distant clusters share their location in the outer halo with a system of nine dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies .",
    "these dwarfs have galactocentric distances in the range @xmath4 kpc ( mateo 1998 )  an interval which includes 16 globular clusters ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "to some extent , the dsph galaxies resemble the globular clusters in that they always contain a population of old metal - poor stars ; there are , however , a number of important distinctions between the two classes of objects .",
    "the central stellar densities of the dsph galaxies are much lower than those of typical globular clusters , and many of the dwarfs show evidence for intermediate - age populations ( e.g. , mateo 1998 ) .",
    "more importantly , measurements of the central velocity dispersions of the dsph galaxies suggest that they are embedded in extended dark halos ( aaronson 1983 ) which are presumably non - baryonic in nature ( feltzing , gilmore & wyse 1999 ) , although alternative explanations have been proposed ( e.g. , milgrom 1995 ; klessen & kroupa 1998 ) .    by contrast ,",
    "color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of distant halo globular clusters show no sign of distinct intermediate - age populations , although there is evidence that some of the clusters may be younger than their counterparts in the inner galaxy ( e.g. , stetson et  al .",
    "1999 ) . and",
    "while there is a preponderance of faint , low - density globular clusters in the outer halo ( see , e.g. , figure 1 of van den bergh 1994 ) , their central stellar densities remain comfortably above those of even the most centrally concentrated dsph galaxies .",
    "furthermore , dynamical studies of nearby globular clusters have established that , unlike the dsph galaxies , they appear to contain little or no dark matter apart from normal stellar remnants such as white dwarfs and neutron stars ( e.g. , pryor & meylan 1993 ) . however , a _ direct _ determination of the internal mass distribution in distant halo clusters has proven impossible since the faintness of even their most evolved red giants  coupled with their sparsely populated red giant branches ( rgbs ) and low surface brightnesses  make the requisite spectroscopic observations extremely challenging .",
    "for example , 12 of the 16 globular clusters with @xmath5 kpc have central surface brightnesses below @xmath6 mag arcsec@xmath7 ; for an assumed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath8 , these clusters are expected to have central velocity dispersions of @xmath9 km s@xmath1 . thus , to study their internal dynamics , a velocity precision of @xmath10 km s@xmath1 for metal - poor stars in the range @xmath11 is required .",
    "it is hardly surprising that these objects have been neglected in previous radial velocity surveys of galactic globular clusters .",
    "the lone exception is ngc 2419 , for which olzewski , pryor & schommer ( 1993 ) measured velocities for 12 red giants . from this small sample",
    ", they found @xmath12 , among the lowest measured for any globular cluster and contrary to the notion that this cluster is embedded in a massive dark halo .",
    "nevertheless , this object is  with an absolute magnitude of @xmath13 ( harris 1996 )  among the most luminous galactic globular clusters and atypical of the clusters which populate the outer halo .",
    "clearly , a dynamical study of a more representative sample of halo clusters is in order .",
    "there are several reasons to suspect that a search for dark halos in outer halo clusters might prove profitable .",
    "first , the characteristic mass of globular clusters is similar to the jeans mass at recombination , and thus has a special cosmological significance ; indeed , it has often been proposed that globular clusters may contain dark halos ( @xmath14 peebles 1984 ; west 1993 ) .",
    "while there is no evidence to support this conjecture , it has in practice proven surprisingly difficult to rule out ( heggie & hut 1996 ) .",
    "for example , as clusters evolve in the galactic tidal field , they are expected to lose mass through tidal stripping  a process which confounds efforts to reconstruct the initial mass distribution in these clusters using present - day observations .",
    "second , there are fairly compelling reasons to believe that some galactic dsph galaxies are dark - matter - dominated , and since globular clusters are simply the next step down in luminosity , it is therefore reasonable to expect that the same scenario which is usually invoked to explain the internal dynamics of the dsph galaxies ( @xmath15 gas ejection from shallow potential wells by supernova - driven winds , followed by adiabatic expansion ; dekel & silk 1986 ) might produce end - products that resemble globular clusters if the gas ejection mechanism was particularly efficient .",
    "this possibility is especially topical in light of the emerging evidence from numerical simulations that the halos of large galaxies have been assembled hierarchically ( e.g. , klypin et  al . 1999 ; moore et  al . 1999 and 2001 ; ct et  al .",
    "2000 ) , although the predicted number of low - mass dark halos greatly exceeds the observed number of dwarf galaxies in such simulations .",
    "various means of resolving this important contradiction have been proposed : i.e. , by supressing the small - scale power in the family of cold dark matter models ( see , e.g. , dav et al .",
    "2001 ) , or by postulating the existence of a large population of  dark galaxies \" ( see , e.g. , hirashita , takeuchi & tamura 1999 ; bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 ) .",
    "there are also some reasons to believe that isolated , low - luminosity clusters may contain significant amounts of _ baryonic _ dark matter .",
    "n - body simulations of evolving globular clusters suggest that as clusters lose mass through dynamical evolution , the fraction of their mass contained in white dwarfs should increase steadily ( vesperini & heggie 1997 ) . the outer halo contains a disproportionately high fraction of low - luminosity clusters , so a search for dynamical evidence of extreme white dwarf populations in these clusters might prove worthwhile .    in 1998 , we began a program to study the internal dynamics of distant halo globular clusters using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory .",
    "this program , which was designed to yield the first direct measurements of the velocity dispersions and mass - to - light ratios for these clusters , was also motivated by the need for improved measurements of the systemic velocities of several of these clusters ( i.e. , the radial velocities of four of the 16 clusters having galactocentric distances greater than 24 kpc are either unknown , or have uncertainties of more than 20 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "it has been noted on numerous occasions that a number of the galactic dwarf galaxies and globular clusters fall along great circles ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1976ab ; kunkel 1979 ; majewski 1994 ) .",
    "such structures would have obvious implications for the formation of the galactic halo , but unambiguous evidence of their existence requires orbital parameters for the putative members .",
    "programs are now underway to measure the proper motions of the distant halo globular clusters and dwarf satellites ( e.g. , dinescu et al .",
    "2001 ) , and accurate radial velocities are a prerequisite for the measurement of their orbits .    in this paper , we present the first results from this program .",
    "our sample consists of seven , predominantly low - concentration clusters having galactocentric distances in the range @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 kpc .",
    "an analysis of the full sample will be presented in a separate paper ; here , we present our findings for a single sparse object , palomar 13 . with an absolute magnitude of @xmath19 mag , palomar 13",
    "is exceeded in luminosity by all but a handful of the @xmath20 150 globular clusters belonging to the milky way , and is one of the objects which has been identified on previous occasions as a possible member of a great stream ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1976a ; lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995 ) . based on our new radial velocities and photometry , we find both the structural properties and the mass - to - light ratio of this object to be anomalous among the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "on the night of 10 september , 1999 , we used the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et  al . 1995 ) on the keck ii telescope to obtain a series of @xmath21 images of palomar 13 .",
    "an observing log for these , and other , observations of palomar 13 may be found in table  [ tab1 ] . in imaging mode , lris has a spatial scale of @xmath22 pixel@xmath1 and a field of view of 58@xmath233 . for each filter",
    ", we obtained a pair of images centered on the cluster .",
    "exposure times were 10 and 300s in @xmath24 , 20 and 480s in @xmath25 , and 6 and 180s in @xmath26 .",
    "conditions during the night were photometric , and the fwhm of isolated stars within the @xmath21 frames were measured to be in the range 07 - 08 .",
    "images were bias - subtracted and then flat - fielded in the iraf environment using sky flats obtained during twilight .",
    "instrumental magnitudes for unresolved objects in the field were derived using the daophot ii software package ( stetson 1993 ) , and calibrated with observations of several landolt ( 1992 ) standard fields taken throughout the night .",
    "the calibration equations took the form @xmath27 aperture corrections were determined separately for each filter , and a master object list was created using the photometry files for the long and short exposures .",
    "the final photometric database contains 840 objects detected with a minimum point - source signal - to - noise ratio of _ s / n _ = 5 in all three filters . a finding chart for palomar 13 constructed from our v images",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "all stars having measured radial velocities ( see  2.2 ) are identified on this image .",
    "images of palomar 13 were also obtained on the night of 14 july , 1999 using the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and the cfh12k mosaic camera ( cuillandre et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "a series of three 600s exposures in each of the @xmath24 and @xmath28 filters were taken with the cluster centered on chip # 8 of the ccd mosaic .",
    "each image was bias - subtracted and flat - fielded , and then shifted and stacked to produce a final image for each of the two filters .",
    "isolated stars in the stacked images were found to have fwhms of 075 in each filter .",
    "photometry was then performed using daophot ii , and the photometry lists were matched .",
    "unfortunately , conditions were non - photometric and it was not possible to calibrate the photometry directly .",
    "however , instrumental ( _ v _ ) magnitudes for stars on chip # 8 were calibrated via secondary standards in this field selected from our keck / lris photometry .",

    "this single field is 2.3 times larger than that available from lris , although the photometric catalog is limited to the range @xmath31 mag ( as opposed to our lris point - source catalog , which spans the range @xmath32 mag ) .    by virtue of its remote location in the outer halo",
    ", palomar 13 should , in principal , play an important role in establishing the chronology of halo formation .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it has been the focus of only little attention in this regard .",
    "cmd studies are limited to photographic study of ortolani , rosino & sandage ( 1985 ) , the ccd study of borissova , markov & spassova ( 1997 ) and the recent photographic / ccd study of siegel et  al .",

    "these difficulties are ameliorated by the high precision of our radial velocity measurements , our new cmd , and the availability of proper motions from siegel et  al .",

    ". nevertheless , a spectroscopic measurement of the metallicity of this star would be desirable .",
    "the situation for ors-118 is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "although siegel et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) report p(@xmath52 ) = 0% for this star , its location in the cmd strongly suggests that it is a true member , since it lies precisely on the rgb of the best - fit isochrone ( see  3.3 ) .",

    "we further note that an abundance analysis for ors-118 ( described below ) yields [ fe / h ] = @xmath59 dex .",
    "this metallicity points to a halo origin , and is consistent with the metallicity of palomar 13 deduced from isochrone fitting ( see  3.3 ) .    to investigate the possibility that ors-118 is simply an interloping foreground star which happens to have the same radial velocity as the palomar 13 , we approximate the line - of - sight velocity distributions expected for disk and halo stars in this direction with the relation @xmath60 \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the mean radial velocity of disk stars along this line of sight as a result of the solar motion towards @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( mihalas & binney 1981 ) .",

    "we further approximate the local velocity dispersion of disk stars as @xmath70 which , from the last row of table 1 of dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) , yields @xmath71 km s@xmath1 .",
    "for the halo , we assume an isotropic velocity ellipsoid ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) and adopt @xmath73  km  s@xmath1 from ct ( 1999 ) .",
    "the resulting probability distributions for disk and halo stars are illustrated by the dotted lines in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "although the absolute normalization of the two curves is arbitrary , their _ relative _ normalization has been adjusted to match the expected number of disk and halo stars with @xmath74 along this line of sight ( determined from the ias galaxy model ; bahcall & soneira 1980 ) .",
    "if ors-118 is indeed a halo field star , then it lies 1.5@xmath75 from the mean of the field distribution ; the probability of such an occurrence is 13% .",
    "moreover , in the range @xmath76 , the ias galaxy model predicts only a single halo field star in our field , and just 8% of halo stars in this magnitude range are expected to have @xmath77 ( i.e. , the color of ors-118 ) .",
    "we conclude that ors-118 is likely to be a _ bona fide _ member of palomar 13 . the origin of the large proper motion residual measured by siegel et  al .",

    "exposure times for our hires observations were chosen to yield the minimum signal - to - noise needed to derive radial velocities with a precision @xmath78 km s@xmath1 .",
    "for ors-118 , the brightest star in our sample which has a radial velocity consistent with membership in palomar 13 , we combined the two spectra obtained during the july 1999 observing run .",
    "the signal - to - noise of ratio of this co - added spectrum  @xmath79 per resolution element  is just adequate for abundance analysis .",

    "once the effective temperature and surface gravity were determined , abundances for the fe i lines were calculated by iteratively varying the microturbulent velocity until the best fit in the diagram of fe i abundance versus equivalent width was achieved .",
    "our best - fit parameters for ors-118 are @xmath80 = 4700 k , @xmath81 = 1.7 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath59 dex , where the rather large uncertainty on the measured metallicity is a reflection of the modest signal - to - noise of our co - added spectrum .",

    "this fact , coupled with palomar 13 s low luminosity and eccentric orbit , led siegel et  al .",

    "the point - source catalog from our keck images consists of 841 objects distributed over an area of 42.8 arcmin@xmath111 . since the palomar 13 field contains a significant number of obvious foreground / background objects",
    " see figure  [ fig4 ]  the keck point - source catalog was trimmed to exclude objects with @xmath112 mag .",

    "there is good agreement between these two independent profiles .",

    "if palomar 13 is experiencing significant mass loss through evaporation and tidal stripping ( see  5.2 ) , then it is the lowest mass stars which are expected to have largest evaporation rates ( i.e. , they should preferentially inhibit the cluster envelope as a result of mass segregation ) .",
    "in such a case , our deeper star counts compared to siegel et al .",

    "more importantly , if this model accurately reflects the true density profile of palomar 13 , there is an even more dramatic  excess \" of stars above the model predictions beyond @xmath129  1@xmath128 .",
    "while it is certainly true that the exact shape of the surface density profile depends on the adopted background level ( particularly at large radii ) this excess is unlikely to be an artifact of the background subtraction .",
    "for instance , achieving an acceptable fit to a king model with @xmath130 for @xmath131 2@xmath128 would require the background level to be increased by roughly an order of magnitude .",

    ", the king - michie which best fits the observed surface density and surface brightness profiles of palomar 13 has a tidal radius of @xmath132 ( 182@xmath13341 pc ) .",
    "since this is more than twice the radial extent of our cfht imaging , the adopted background level should be viewed with some caution .",

    ". we will discuss these models in detail below ( in  4 - 5 ) , but before doing so , we shall use the radial velocities presented in table 2 to investigate the internal kinematics of palomar  13 .",
    "using our sample of 21 members ( v2 excluded ) , we calculate a systemic velocity of @xmath143 km s@xmath1 using the maximum likelihood estimator of pryor & meylan ( 1993 ) .",
    "the corresponding estimate for the the projected _ intrinsic _ velocity dispersion using this same sample is @xmath2 km s@xmath1 . omitting ors-118 from the sample ( see  3.1 ) has essentially no effect on the derived parameters : @xmath144 km s@xmath1 and @xmath145 km s@xmath1",
    "likewise , if ors-32 is omitted from the sample , the best - fit parameters do not change significantly : @xmath146 km s@xmath1 and @xmath147 km s@xmath1 .    in the upper panel of figure  [ fig8 ] ,",

    "the horizontal dashed line shows the systemic velocity , @xmath148 km s@xmath1 , while the vertical arrows at @xmath149 denote the radius where the possible excess in the surface density profile begins .",
    "it is perhaps noteworthy that the stars with the largest velocity residuals are located at , or beyond , this radius .",
    "we note that there is a tendency for stars with the most discrepant velocities to also have the smallest uncertainties  this is a consequence of the fact that these stars were observed on multiple observing runs to confirm the first - epoch velocities and to search for any evidence of binarity . as with the full sample ,",
    "none of these stars shows compelling evidence for radial velocity variations .    in the lower panel of figure  [ fig8 ]",
    ", we plot the velocity dispersion profile for palomar 13 .",
    "the open circle denotes the dispersion found using our complete sample of 21 members , plotted at their mean radius : @xmath150 = 084 ( 5.9 pc ) .",
    "the filled circles show the results of dividing the sample into two radial bins containing 11 and 10 stars , respectively . in this case , the dispersions are 1.0@xmath1330.4 km s@xmath1 at @xmath150 = 036 ( 2.6 pc ) and 2.6@xmath1330.6 km s@xmath1 at @xmath150 = 136 ( 9.6 pc ) .",
    "although there may be some evidence for a rising velocity dispersion profile , we caution that this result is based on a small sample , and that the uncertainties in the measured dispersions are appreciable .",
    "how does the measured velocity dispersion for palomar 13 compare with expectations ?",
    "globular clusters are well described by king - michie models , in which the central velocity dispersion ( in km  s@xmath1 ) may be approximated by @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the @xmath24-band mass - to - light ratio , @xmath153 is the core radius in pc , and @xmath154 is the central surface brightness is units of @xmath155  pc@xmath7 ( e.g. , richstone & tremaine 1986 ; mateo et  al .",
    "based on the king - michie model fits to the observed surface brightness profile presented in  3.4 and table  [ tab3 ] , the _ expected _ velocity dispersion of palomar 13 is @xmath156  km  s@xmath1 for an assumed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , our measured velocity dispersion exceeds the expected value by roughly a factor of four .",
    "the implications of this finding are presented below , along with a more detailed analysis of the internal kinematics palomar  13 .",
    "as discussed in  3.4 , our new surface density profile for palomar 13 suggests that either a significant fraction of its stars are located beyond the ostensible tidal radius , or the object is more spatially extended than previously believed .",
    "we now examine its internal kinematics within the context of these two scenarios .",
    "the short - dashed curve in figure  [ fig7 ] shows the king - michie which best fits the observed surface brightness profile for palomar 13 .",

    "( these and other model parameters are summarized in table  [ tab3 ] , along with various observed and derived properties of palomar 13 . ) according to this model , palomar 13 has both a higher concentration _ and _ a greater spatial extent ( @xmath160 pc ) than suggested by previous studies .",
    "indeed , this concentration index is considerably larger than that expected for a globular cluster of this luminosity or surface brightness ( see , e.g. , djorgovski 1991 ) .",
    "integration of this profile yields a total luminosity of @xmath161 @xmath155 .",
    "the corresponding velocity dispersion profile for an assumed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath8 is shown by the lower dashed curve in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig8 ] ( i.e. , curve 1-a ) . in agreement with the naive analysis presented above",
    ", we find the measured velocity dispersion to exceed that expected for a normal globular cluster of this concentration and luminosity .",
    "a maximum likelihood solution for the best - fit scale velocity of this same king - michie model gives the upper dashed curve shown in this figure ( i.e. , curve 1-b ) .",
    "this model has a central velocity dispersion of @xmath162 km  s@xmath1 , and a total mass of @xmath163 @xmath164 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is then @xmath165 ( 1@xmath75 uncertainties ) .",
    "alternatively , we may use the king - michie model suggested by siegel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to estimate the mass and mass - to - light ratio of palomar 13 .",
    "this model , which is shown by the dotted curve in figure  [ fig7 ] , yields a total luminosity of @xmath166 @xmath155 .",
    "a maximum likelihood scaling of the model velocity dispersion profile to the measured velocities produces the dotted curve in the lower panel of figure  [ fig8 ] ( i.e. , curve 2 ) . for this model , which has a central velocity dispersion of @xmath167 km  s@xmath1 , the mass within the tidal radius ( @xmath168 or 23 pc ) is @xmath169 @xmath164 .",
    "the corresponding mass - to - light ratio is @xmath170 where the quoted 1@xmath75 uncertainties refer only to the errors on the derived mass . _",
    "thus , irrespective of the adopted surface brightness profile , it is not possible to reproduce the observed velocity dispersion with a mass - to - light ratio that is typical of globular clusters ( e.g. , @xmath171 ; pryor & meylan 1993 ) . _",
    "what are the implications of this finding ? we begin by examining  and tentatively rejecting  the possibility that the observed velocity dispersion has been inflated by a  velocity jitter \" in the atmospheres of the program stars , or by a population of spectroscopic binary stars .",
    "we then examine other scenarios which may explain the observed properties of palomar 13 including tidal disruption , a mass function which is heavily skewed to low - mass stars or heavy stellar remnants , modified newtonian dynamics , and/or the presence of a massive dark halo .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind that these various possibilities may not be mutually exclusive ( i.e. , a very high binary fraction combined with tidal heating and mass loss ) .",
    "the value of @xmath2 km s@xmath1 reported in  3.5 refers to the _ intrinsic _ velocity dispersion for palomar 13 : i.e. , the contribution from measurement uncertainties has been removed ( see , pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "our velocity uncertainties have been calculated empirically from 53 distinct radial velocities of faint metal - poor stars ( accumulated during multiple observing runs ) so we are confident that the measured dispersion is _ not _ the result of underestimated velocity uncertainties .",
    "such an explanation would require @xmath172 km s@xmath1 ( see equation  [ eq2 ] ) , whereas we measure @xmath173 km s@xmath1 and find @xmath174 km s@xmath1 at 99% confidence .",
    "bright red giants in globular clusters often show evidence for radial velocity variations in the range 2 - 5 km s@xmath1 ( gunn & griffin 1979 ; mayor et  al .",
    "this so - called velocity  jitter \" is thought to arise from pulsational motions in the atmospheres of these evolved stars .",
    "it is unlikely that our measured velocity dispersion is the result of such velocity variations since long - term monitoring of red giants in nearby globular clusters has established that the magnitude of this jitter shows a strong luminosity dependence : i.e. , it is significant at the 1 km s@xmath1 level only for stars which are located within @xmath20 1 mag of the rgb tip .",
    "our radial velocity sample includes no stars this bright .",
    "in fact , our most luminous member ( ors-118 ) has @xmath175 mag  a full 2.3 mag below the tip of the rgb .",
    "might our estimate for the velocity dispersion be the inflated by  dynamically - hard \" spectroscopic binary stars residing in the cluster ?",
    "there are reasons to believe that the binary star fraction in palomar 13 may be appreciable .",
    "first , the cmd of palomar 13 shows both a sizeable blue straggler population and a possible  second sequence \"  features which are usually interpreted as signatures of unresolved binaries ( mateo et  al .",
    "1990 ; romani & weinberg 1991 ) .",
    "second , on purely theoretical grounds , the low stellar density and velocity dispersion of palomar 13 ( for an assumed  normal \" mass - to - light ratio ) suggest that even wide binaries might have survived disruption over a hubble time .",
    "for instance , for a central velocity dispersion of @xmath176 km s@xmath1 , a pair of equal - mass @xmath177 stars would be disrupted by encounters with other members only if separated by more than @xmath178 1,400 au ( hills 1984 ) .",
    "such binaries , if on circular orbits , would have periods of @xmath179 yr and orbital velocities of @xmath180 km s@xmath1 : i.e. , modest , but potentially important , given the low dispersion expected for palomar 13 .",
    "to explore the possible effects of binary stars on our measured velocity dispersion , we have carried out monte - carlo simulations similar to those described in pryor , latham & hazen ( 1988 ) and ct et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in brief",
    ", we have generated simulated radial velocity measurements having the identical precision and temporal spacing as the actual dataset .",
    "for each simulation , we take the intrinsic velocity dispersion to that predicted by a king - model having @xmath181 , and calculate the contribution to the measured velocity dispersion of a randomly drawn percentage , @xmath182 , of unresolved spectroscopic binary stars .",
    "binaries are assumed to have circular orbits .",
    "the orbital periods in years , @xmath183 , and mass ratios , @xmath184 , are drawn at random over the ranges , @xmath185 and @xmath186 . for each @xmath182",
    ", we generate 1000 artificial datasets and calculate the mean cluster dispersion in precisely the same manner as the actual for the actual data ; the percentage of binaries is varied until the median dispersion found in 1000 simulated datasets is equal to the value obtained using the actual observations .",
    "these simulation suggest that a value of @xmath187 produces a median velocity dispersion which best matches the observed value of @xmath188 km  s@xmath1 . if it is assumed that the binaries do not have circular orbits , but instead have a  thermal \" distribution of eccentricites , then the percentage of binaries needed to explain the measured dispersion would be roughly twice as large ( see pryor et  al . 1988 ; ct et  al .",
    "1996 ) .    by definition , the velocity dispersion _",
    "profile _ predicted by these simulations differs from that of the input king - michie model only in normalization since we have made the first - order assumption that the binaries have the same density distribution as the single stars .",
    "however , if the binaries are instead assumed to be more centrally concentrated than the other stars  perhaps as a result of mass segregation  then the expected velocity dispersion profile would show a steeper decline .",
    "needless to say , a _ rising _ velocity dispersion profile would prove difficult to reconcile with this scenario .",
    "we find weak evidence for an outward increase in the observed velocity dispersion of palomar 13 but given the small number of measured velocities , this feature clearly needs to be confirmed by additional observations . as figure  [ fig6 ] demonstrates , there are many promising candidates beyond @xmath189 ( i.e. , the radii of the most distant members in the current radial velocity sample )",
    ". it would be of considerable interest to measure velocities for these stars in order to determine if they are members of palomar 13 and , if so , to see if the velocity dispersion profile rises with increasing radius .",
    "likewise , it would be desirable to search directly for velocity variations associated with possible orbital motions of these stars .",
    "unfortunately , the long periods of the putative binaries would render any such search hopeless ; a more promising approach would be to measure @xmath182 by modeling the  second sequence \" measured from high - resolution _ hst _ imaging ( e.g. , rubenstein & bailyn 1997 ) .    finally , we note that spectroscopic binaries may offer a viable explanation for the observed high velocity dispersion , but they can not on their own explain the anomalous surface density profile .",
    "an underlying assumption of the dynamical analysis presented in  4 is that of virial equilibrium . in light of the large velocity dispersion measured for palomar 13 , it is prudent to investigate the validity of this assumption , which has recently been called into question for many of the dwarf satellites and globular clusters in the galactic halo ( majewski et al .",
    "simply put , could palomar 13 be in the process of disruption ?",
    "this possibility was advocated by siegel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who combined their proper motion measurements with the systemic radial velocity presented here to derive an orbit for palomar 13 .",
    "they concluded that palomar 13 is just @xmath20 70 myr past perigalacticon ( @xmath190 kpc ) and suggested that it has undergone catastrophic tidal heating during its recent approach . since n - body simulations of tidal tails in globular clusters ( combes , leon & meylan 1999 ) show that the time taken for evaporating stars to diffuse along the cluster orbit can exceed this timescale , it is worth examining this possibility further .",
    "siegel et al . ( 2001 ) noted the presence of a population of  extra - tidal \" stars in their surface density profile .",
    "we too find a possible excess in the palomar 13 surface density profile , beginning at @xmath191 1@xmath128 .",
    "this feature is evident in both the cfht and lris surface density profiles , and the cfht photometry suggests that many of these stars have magnitudes and colors which are consistent with those expected for palomar 13 members ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "thus , we confirm the existence of this feature ; the issue is whether the stars associated with it are truly evaporating from palomar 13 , or if they are instead bound members .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , the surface density profile for palomar 13 shows a roughly power - law decline for @xmath129  03 .",

    "n - body simulations of the tidal heating of satellites indicate that the tidally stripped material tends to diffuse along the orbits , forming leading and trailing streams .",
    "we have examined our star counts for evidence of such streams by measuring the mean surface density of stars in four quadrants over the radial range @xmath206 288 .",
    "the inner limit corresponds to the the break radius , @xmath198 , while the outer limit is the most distant radius at which our geometric coverage is still 100% complete .",
    "the results of this exercise are shown in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "we find only weak evidence that these stars are oriented along a preferred direction .",
    "the density maxima of the best - fit sinusoid shown in this figure are found at position angles of @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the agreement between this orientation and those of the absolute proper motion vector , @xmath209 , and the galactic center direction , @xmath210 , is unexceptional : i.e. , the differences in position angles are @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "there is poor agreement with the vector perpendicular to the galactic disk , which has @xmath213 .",
    "if the peculiar surface density profile of palomar 13 is indeed the result of tidal heating , then this lack of a preferred orientation for the putative extra - tidal stars is somewhat puzzling .",
    "it would be worthwhile investigating this issue using star counts which extend over a wider field , preferably well beyond the modest range radial range ( @xmath214 ) examined above .",
    "piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) have used n - body simulations to show that it is possible to heat the outer regions of satellites during close passages with the galaxy .",
    "such encounters often have the effect of inducing _ ordered _ motions at large radii while leaving the central velocity dispersion unchanged . according to the simulations , the gradient in velocity",
    "is usually maximized along the vector which points to the galactic center .",
    "this vector is shown by the long arrow in figure  [ fig1 ] ; for comparison , the short arrow shows the direction of the cluster motion as measured by siegel et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , while the intermediate arrow denotes the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig10 ] , we find no statistically significant evidence for  rotation \" among our program stars , as might be expected for stars in the leading or trailing streams of a disrupting cluster ( see also figure  [ fig1 ] where the velocity residuals are illustrated on a star - by - star basis ) .    finally , we note that there is an additional ( albeit indirect ) constraint on the mass and dynamical status of palomar 13 . the tidal radius of a satellite object orbiting in the galactic potential is given by @xmath215^{1/3 } \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] where @xmath216 is the distance from the galactic center at perigalacticon",

    "2001 ) , and assuming using @xmath222 ( fich & tremaine 1991 ) and @xmath223 km s@xmath1 , we find @xmath224 pc for a total luminosity of @xmath225  @xmath155 .",
    "this is remarkably close to the tidal radius of @xmath226 pc for the king - michie model of siegel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which is shown as the dotted curves in figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "this is consistent with the view that the excess in the surface density profile is a population of extra - tidal stars .",
    "the alternative interpretation  that the much larger tidal radius implied by the best - fit king - michie model in figure  [ fig7 ] is evidence for dark matter in palomar 13  will be examined in ",
    "5.4      taken at face value , the measured velocity dispersion for palomar 13 implies a total mass of @xmath227 , far greater than that expected on the basis of the observed luminosity : i.e. , @xmath228 .",
    "the obvious baryonic candidates for this additional mass would be low - mass main - sequence stars , or heavy stellar remnants such as white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "both varieties of heavy remnants are known to populate globular clusters ( see hut et al .",
    "1992 ) and the contribution of white dwarfs to the overall mass budget is thought to increase as clusters evaporate ( e.g. , vesperini & heggie 1997 ) . in this case , the low - luminosity of palomar 13 might be interpreted as indirect evidence for an advanced stage of dynamical evolution . however ,",
    "if one accepts the view that palomar 13 is in dynamical equilibrium ( see above ) , then this would require @xmath20 95% of the total mass to reside in heavy remnants .",
    "this percentage is _ far _ higher than that found in nearby , well - studied clusters : e.g. , meylan ( 1987 ; 1989 ) finds the percentage of heavy remnants ( mainly white dwarfs ) in 47 tucanae and @xmath204 centauri to be @xmath229% and @xmath230% , respectively ( though the dynamical mass found here for palomar 13 is only half that contained in heavy remnants in 47 tuc , by virue of the latter s much larger mass ) .",
    "unfortunately , a direct search for white dwarfs in palomar 13 would be extremely challenging since even the brightest such objects are expected to have @xmath231 mag at this distance ( richer et  al .",
    "1997 )    on the other hand , a determination of the main - sequence luminosity function down to this level ( corresponding to @xmath232 mag and @xmath233 25 ; silvestri et  al .",
    "1998 ) is well within the reach of _ hst _ , and could put interesting constraints on the mass contained in low - mass , main - sequence stars .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig11 ] , the available data suggest that the main - sequence luminosity function of palomar 13 is adequately described by a rather _ flat _ mass function , with exponent @xmath234 over the range @xmath235 ( equivalent to @xmath236 ; bergbusch & vandenberg 1992 ) . if the initial mass function of palomar 13 had a more nearly universal form ( for instance , near the  salpeter value \" of @xmath237 ; salpeter 1955 ) , then the flat mass function we find may be evidence for advanced dynamical evolution and the preferential evaporation of low - mass stars . in short , the available data provide no reason to believe that the mass function of palomar 13 is abnormal in any way , but firm conclusions must await deeper observations      in  5.2 , it was found that , for an assumed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath8 ( i.e. , a value appropriate for typical globular clusters ) , the tidal radius of palomar 13 predicted by equation ( 9 ) was in good agreement with the tidal radius of the low - concentration ( @xmath238 ) king - michie model adopted by siegel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . as discussed in  3.5 and  4 ,",
    "it is possible to obtain an excellent match to the observed surface brightness and surface density profiles using a king - michie model which has @xmath158 . in this case , the tidal radius of palomar 13 is @xmath160 pc ( with a formal uncertainty of @xmath133 23% based on our monte - carlo simulations ) . from equation ( 9 ) , we see that a tidal radius of this size suggests a mass of @xmath239  @xmath164  i.e. , considerably larger than our best - estimate for the dynamical mass of palomar 13 ( assuming virial equilibrium ) yet still far in excess of the _ expected _ mass .",
    "the actual uncertainties in the fitted tidal radii are difficult to gauge , but are unlikely to be smaller than @xmath20 50% , which translates directly into a nearly a factor of two in mass .",
    "thus , we conclude that the tidal radii inferred from the surface brightness and surface density profiles of palomar 13 are : ( 1 ) highly dependent on how one chooses to model the profile ; and ( 2 ) consistent with either the tidal disruption of an otherwise normal globular cluster , or the presence of substantial dark matter component in this object .    in light of these results",
    ", it is natural to ask if the high velocity dispersion of palomar 13 might also be the signature of a non - baryonic dark matter halo , similar to those belonging to local group dsph galaxies ( aaronson 1983 ; mateo 1998 ; @xmath240 klessen & kroupa 1998 ) .",
    "this possibility is particularly topical given recent claims from cdm simulations that the halos of large galaxies may contain large numbers of low - mass ,  dark satellites \" ( e.g. , hirashita et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al . 1999",
    "; bullock et al . 2000 ) .    to examine this possibility",
    ", we consider a simple two - component model .",
    "first , we take the mass density profile of the luminous stellar component to be given by a dehnen ( 1993 ) model , @xmath241(\\upsilon\\rho^0_{*,l}/{\\pi}a^3)(r / a)^{-{\\gamma}}(1 + r / a)^{{\\gamma } - 4 } \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] where @xmath242 is the central _ luminosity _ density of this component , @xmath243 is its scale radius , and @xmath244 is its mass - to - light ratio . by contrast",
    ", the dark halo is assumed to have the form proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) : @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the scale radius of the dark halo , and @xmath247 is the central dark matter density .",
    "once these density distributions are specified , the velocity dispersion profile follows from the the jeans equation , @xmath248 + { 2{\\beta}{\\rho}_*(r){\\sigma}_r^2(r ) \\over r } = -{gm(r ) \\over r^2}{\\rho}_*(r ) , \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] where @xmath249 is the radial component of the velocity dispersion and @xmath250 is the combined masses of the luminous and dark components . for our purposes ,",
    "we assume that the velocity dispersion tensor is isotropic ( i.e. , @xmath251 ) .",
    "this theoretical velocity dispersion profile is then projected onto the plane of the sky , and compared directly to the observed velocity dispersion .    before doing so",
    ", we require estimates of @xmath252 and @xmath243 from the surface brightness profile .",
    "the long - dashed curve in figure  [ fig7 ] shows the best - fit dehnen model , with @xmath253 and @xmath254 ( 15.9@xmath1331.0 pc ) , overlaid on the observed surface brightness profile . for an assumed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath255",
    ", the total mass associated with this stellar component is @xmath256 .",
    "we also assume that , in projection , the dark matter matches that of the surface brightness profile , giving @xmath257 ( 2.8@xmath1330.1 pc ) . this nfw model",
    " fitted to the observed surface brightness profile  is shown by the solid curve in figure  [ fig7 ] . the central _ mass density _ of this model",
    "is then left as a free parameter which is adjusted until a reasonable match to the observed velocity dispersion is achieved .",
    "the corresponding velocity dispersion profile for a central mass density of @xmath258 pc@xmath259 is shown as the solid curve in figure  [ fig8 ] ( i.e. , curve 3 ) .",
    "this curve provides an adequate ( though by no means unique ) description of the observed velocity dispersion profile including the possible maximum at @xmath56 .",
    "although the mass of an nfw profile diverges as @xmath260 , we note that over the range of our radial velocity and surface brightness observations , the implied mass - to - light ratio of this two component model is @xmath261  about half that found using a king - michie model , but still well above that expected for a normal stellar population .",
    "how does the central density of this putative dark halo compare to those found for the dsph satellites of the milky way ?",
    "table 1 of mateo ( 1998 ) lists structural parameters for nine galactic dsph galaxies having measured velocity dispersions : the central densities of these galaxies span the range @xmath262 , with a mean value of @xmath263 . strictly speaking",
    ", these values refer to the _ combined _ densities of the dark and luminous components , @xmath264 . however , in view of the low stellar densities of these galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath265 ) , @xmath266 to good approximation .",
    "_ thus , the dark matter density needed to explain the measured velocity dispersion of palomar 13 exceeds that of typical dsph galaxies by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "_    following kormendy ( 1990 ) , we show in figures  [ fig12 ] and  [ fig13 ] the scaling relations between central density , velocity dispersion , @xmath75 , absolute blue magnitude , @xmath267 , core radius , @xmath153 , and central @xmath25-band surface brightness , @xmath268 , for a sample of local group dsph galaxies ( mateo 1998 ) , dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies ( ct , carignan & freeman 2000 and references therein ) and galactic globular clusters ( pryor & meylan 1993 ; harris 1996 ) .",
    "note that the densities plotted here refer to those of the _ dark halos _ , with the exception of the globular clusters ; for these objects , the densities are those calculated directly from the measured velocity dispersions .",
    "for palomar 13 , which is indicated by the large filled circle , we take the structural parameters for its putative dark matter halo to be those given by the best - fit nfw model . as these figures demonstrate , the central dark matter density in palomar 13 is indeed much larger than those found for dwarf galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also consistent with that expected from an extrapolation of galactic scaling relations to low luminosities .",
    "indeed , it is remarkable that palomar 13 falls so near the extrapolations of the tight scaling relations for dwarf galaxies , although this agreement can not be taken as unambiguous evidence for a common origin since palomar 13 also falls near the edges of the more heterogeneous distributions for galactic globular clusters ( and , in the scaling relations involving @xmath268 , its location may be more consistent with the globular cluster distributions ) .",
    "thus , the evidence from the observed scaling relations concerning the proper classification of palomar 13 as a _ bone  fide _ globular cluster or an extreme dark - matter dwarf galaxy , is ambiguous . in any event , we note that a naive extrapolation of the dwarf galaxy scaling relations to globular cluster scales predicts central densities for dark matter halos in these objects that are sufficiently low ( i.e. , @xmath269 ) to make their detection extremely challenging in all but the faintest clusters . in other words , for the vast majority of globular clusters , the inferred dark matter densities would fall well below the _ baryonic _ densities .",
    "obviously , it would be of considerable interest to measure velocity dispersions for additional faint , low surface brightness clusters .",
    "an especially interesting target is am 4 , a cluster which shares many of the characteristics of palomar 13 : i.e. , low luminosity ( @xmath270 ) , low surface brightness ( @xmath271 mag arcsec@xmath7 ) , and low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath272 dex ) .",
    "like palomar 13 , it is also occupies a relatively isolated location in the galactic halo , with @xmath273 kpc .",
    "the central velocity dispersion predicted by equation ( 7 ) for a  normal \" globular cluster of this surface brightness would be @xmath274 km s@xmath1 , and it would be interesting to see if this expectation is borne out by radial velocity measurements .",
    "we consider three final scaling relations for dwarf galaxies in figure  [ fig14 ] . in the upper panel of this figure",
    ", metallicity is plotted against absolute magnitude for de / dsph galaxies , along with the best - fit linear relation from ct et al .",
    "note that the relationship between metallicity and luminosity constitutes a key difference between dwarf galaxies and globular clusters : i.e. , galaxies spanning a range of @xmath275 in luminosity follow a tight relation between metallicity and luminosity ( e.g. , brodie & huchra 1991 ; caldwell et al .",
    "1992 ) , whereas globular clusters obey no such correlation . while it is by no means clear that a simple extrapolation of this linear relation to @xmath276 is justifiable , palomar 13 is nevertheless considerably more metal - rich than might naively be expected for a dwarf of this luminosity .",
    "furthermore , its cmd shows no evidence for an abundance spread , unlike local group dsph galaxies which often show internal dispersions in metallicity of @xmath20 0.35 dex ( e.g. , ct et al . 2000 ; shetrone , ct & sargent 2001 ) .    in the middle panel of figure  [ fig14 ] ,",
    "mass - to - light ratio is plotted against absolute magnitude for all local group de / dsph galaxies having measured velocity dispersions .",
    "the dashed curve shows the relation expected for dwarf consisting of luminous stellar components with @xmath8 that are embedded in dark matter halos of mass @xmath277 , as proposed by mateo et al .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio predicted for palomar 13 by this relation would be @xmath278 , making it an extreme outlier . on the other hand ,",
    "palomar 13 _ does _ seem to follow the correlation between mass - to - light ratio , metallicity and central surface brightness for local group dwarfs , shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig14 ] ( prada & burkert 2001 ) .",
    "we can only conclude that the evidence regarding a possible connection between palomar 13 and dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxies is ambiguous and that , in light of the complexity of gas cooling , star formation and feedback in low - mass systems ( see , e.g. , figure  8 of mateo 1998 ) , a definitive conclusion is not possible at the present time .",
    "a much different interpetation of the large velocity dispersion of dsph galaxies has been proposed by milgrom ( 1983a ) , who suggested that at low accelerations , @xmath279 , newtonian gravity should be revised to include a repulsive term .",
    "if this modified theory of newtonian dynamics ( i.e. , mond ) is correct , then this there would be no need to invoke dark matter as an explanation for the high velocity dispersions of dwarf galaxies ( milgrom 1983b ; 1995 ) .",
    "but if mond is to be a viable alternative to dark matter , then it must apply to all systems in which the the acceleration falls below the characteristic mond value , @xmath280 cm s@xmath7  value chosen to match the rotation curves of low - surface brightness galaxies ( begeman , broeils & sanders 1991 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) .",
    "since this condition is met for palomar 13 , we now examine its internal dynamics within the mond framework .",
    "there are two relevant accelerations for palomar 13 : the acceleration arising from the internal mass distribution , and an external component due to the milky way .",
    "we approximate the internal acceleration as @xmath281 , where @xmath250 is mass enclosed with a radius , @xmath29 , for the best - fit king model shown in figure  [ fig7 ] . for an assumed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath8 , the internal acceleration reaches a maximum value of @xmath282 cm s@xmath1 at @xmath283 .",
    "the external acceleration may be approximated as @xmath284 , or @xmath285 cm s@xmath1 for @xmath223 km s@xmath1 and @xmath286 kpc .",
    "thus , according to mond , palomar 13 is in the  quasi - newtonian weak - field limit \" since @xmath287 . in this regime ,",
    "the newtonian mass is related to the mond mass by a factor , @xmath49 , which falls in the range @xmath288 ( gerhard & spergel 1992 ) . from table 4",
    ", the best - fit king - michie model has @xmath289 in solar units .",
    "thus , the mass - to - light ratio in mond would be reduced by  at most  a factor of @xmath290 , giving @xmath291 . apparently , the high mass - to - light ratio of palomar 13 persists ( at the 2@xmath75 level ) even within the mond framework .",
    "we conclude that this explanation appears less appealing than those involving tidal disruption or dark matter .",
    "an imaging and spectroscopic survey of globular clusters in the outer halo of the milky way has shown palomar 13 to exhibit several puzzling features .    from an abundance analysis of our hires",
    "spectra for a single rgb star and isochrone fitting to the cmd , we estimate the metallicity of palomar 13 to be [ fe / h ] = @xmath93 dex . we find a true distance modulus of @xmath292 mag and a distance of @xmath293 kpc , placing palomar 13 squarely in the outer halo . with @xmath102 mag ,",
    "this is the lowest luminosity object in our survey .",
    "the sparsely populated red giant and horizontal branches preclude a precise age determination , but a 14 gyr isochrone is found to provide a reasonable match to the observed fiducial sequences .",
    "thus , in terms of its stellar populations , palomar 13 appears typical of globular clusters in the outer halo .",
    "however , from a sample of 21 probable members with radial velocity measurements from hires , we find the systemic velocity and intrinsic velocity dispersion of palomar 13 to be @xmath143 km s@xmath1 and @xmath2 km s@xmath1 , respectively . this velocity dispersion is roughly four times higher than that expected on the basis of the observed luminosity and concentration .",
    "taken at face value , this dispersion suggests a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath165 , with the exact value depending on the details of the modeling .",
    "this mass - to - light ratio is far higher than those found for globular clusters , but is comparable to those of galactic dsph galaxies .",
    "the surface density profile is also found to be anomalous among galactic globular clusters , in that it shows a significant number of apparent member stars beyond the tidal radius of a low concentration king - michie model ( i.e. , @xmath238 , as has usually been claimed for palomar 13 ) . on the other hand , an excellent fit to the surface brightness profile over all radii",
    "is provided by a king - michie model with @xmath294 , as well as by models of the type suggested by dehnen ( 1993 ) and navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "based on the measured velocity dispersion and surface density profile , two possibilities present themselves : ( 1 ) either palomar 13 has recently undergone catastrophic heating and mass loss , as might be expected on the basis of its orbital properties ; or ( 2 ) its spatial extent , central concentration , and mass have been greatly underestimated in previous studies .",
    "other factors , such as a large fraction of spectroscopic binary stars or the presence of a large number of heavy remnants , may play contribute to palomar 13 s unusual properties but are , on their own , unlikely to provide a complete explanation of the observed structural and kinematic properties . additional observations  particularly deep imaging with _",
    "hst _ and ground - based mosaic cameras , and radial velocity measurements for an expanded sample of stars at large radii  should help discriminate between the various possibilities . in any event ,",

    "<S> we report the first results of a program to study the internal kinematics of globular clusters in the outer halo of the milky way . using the keck telescope and high resolution echelle spectrometer , </S>",
    "<S> we have measured precise radial velocities for 30 candidate red giants in the direction of palomar 13 , an object traditionally cataloged as a compact , low - luminosity globular cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we have combined these radial velocities with published proper motion membership probabilities and new ccd photometry from the keck and canada - france - hawaii telescopes , to isolate a sample of 21 probable members . </S>",
    "<S> we find a systemic velocity of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and a projected , intrinsic velocity dispersion of @xmath2 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> although small , this dispersion is nevertheless several times larger than that expected for a globular cluster of this luminosity and central concentration . </S>",
    "<S> taken at face value , this dispersion implies a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath3 based on the best - fit king - michie model . </S>",
    "<S> the surface density profile of palomar 13 also appears to be anomalous among galactic globular clusters  depending upon the details of background subtraction and model - fitting , palomar 13 either contains a substantial population of  extra - tidal \" stars , or it is far more spatially extended than previously suspected . </S>",
    "<S> the full surface density profile is equally well - fit by a king - michie model having a high concentration and large tidal radius , or by a nfw model . we examine </S>",
    "<S>  and tentatively reject  a number of possible explanations for the observed characteristics of palomar 13 ( e.g. , velocity  jitter \" among the red giants , spectroscopic binary stars , non - standard mass functions , modified newtonian dynamics ) , and conclude that the two most plausible scenarios are either catastrophic heating during a recent perigalacticon passage , or the presence of a massive dark halo . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the available evidence suggests that palomar 13 is either a globular cluster which is now in the process of dissolving into the galactic halo , or a faint , dark - matter - dominated stellar system . </S>"
