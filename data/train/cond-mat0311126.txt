    "the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite is a highly successful and widely applied technique of modern - day quantum many - body theory . in particular ,",
    "the ccm has been applied to quantum magnetic systems at zero temperature @xcite over the last ten years or so .",
    "indeed , the use of computational approaches of the ccm for quantum systems has been found to be particularly efficacious .",
    "we note that the subsequent application of these highly accurate computational ccm techniques to other types of quantum system is ripe .    in this article",
    ", we present a simple parallelisation procedure for high - order coupled cluster method ( ccm ) calculations .",
    "this approach is investigated and illustrated by the application to the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom lattice with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbour bonds .",
    "in particular , we note that we may consider up to approximately 10000 fundamental clusters , although we believe that further increases ( of at least another order of magnitude ) in the number of fundamental clusters might be possible in future by using such techniques .",
    "the exact ket and bra ground - state energy eigenvectors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , of a general many - body system described by a hamiltonian @xmath4 , @xmath5 are parametrised within the single - reference ccm as follows : @xmath6 the single model or reference state @xmath7 is required to have the property of being a cyclic vector with respect to two well - defined abelian subalgebras of _ multi - configurational _ creation operators @xmath8 and their hermitian - adjoint destruction counterparts @xmath9 .",
    "thus , @xmath7 plays the role of a vacuum state with respect to a suitable set of ( mutually commuting ) many - body creation operators @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and that @xmath12 , the identity operator .",
    "these operators are furthermore complete in the many - body hilbert ( or fock ) space . also , the _ correlation operator _",
    "@xmath13 is decomposed entirely in terms of these creation operators @xmath8 , which , when acting on the model state ( @xmath14 ) , create excitations from it .",
    "we note that although the manifest hermiticity , ( @xmath15 ) , is lost , the normalisation conditions @xmath16 are explicitly imposed .",
    "the _ correlation coefficients _",
    "@xmath17 are regarded as being independent variables , and the full set @xmath17 thus provides a complete description of the ground state .",
    "for instance , an arbitrary operator @xmath18 will have a ground - state expectation value given as , @xmath19 we note that the exponentiated form of the ground - state ccm parametrisation of eq .",
    "( [ ccm_eq2 ] ) ensures the correct counting of the _ independent _ and excited correlated many - body clusters with respect to @xmath7 which are present in the exact ground state @xmath2 .",
    "it also ensures the exact incorporation of the goldstone linked - cluster theorem , which itself guarantees the size - extensivity of all relevant extensive physical quantities .",
    "the determination of the correlation coefficients @xmath17 is achieved by taking appropriate projections onto the ground - state schrdinger equations of eq .",
    "( [ ccm_eq1 ] ) .",
    "equivalently , they may be determined variationally by requiring the ground - state energy expectation functional @xmath20 , defined as in eq .",
    "( [ ccm_eq6 ] ) , to be stationary with respect to variations in each of the ( independent ) variables of the full set .",
    "we thereby easily derive the following coupled set of equations , @xmath21 { \\rm e}^s|\\phi\\rangle   = 0 , \\;\\ ; i \\neq 0 \\ ; . \\label{ccm_eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ ccm_eq7 ] ) also shows that the ground - state energy at the stationary point has the simple form @xmath22 it is important to realize that this ( bi-)variational formulation does _ not _ lead to an upper bound for @xmath23 when the summations for @xmath13 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ ccm_eq2 ] ) are truncated , due to the lack of exact hermiticity when such approximations are made .",
    "however , one can prove that the important hellmann - feynman theorem _ is _ preserved in all such approximations .",
    "in the case of spin - lattice problems of the type considered here , the operators @xmath25 become products of spin - raising operators @xmath26 over a set of sites @xmath27 , with respect to a model state @xmath7 in which all spins points `` downward '' in some suitably chosen local spin axes .",
    "the ccm formalism is exact in the limit of inclusion of all possible such multi - spin cluster correlations for @xmath13 and @xmath28 , although in any real application this is usually impossible to achieve .",
    "it is therefore necessary to utilise various approximation schemes within @xmath13 and @xmath24 .",
    "the three most commonly employed schemes previously utilised have been : ( 1 ) the sub@xmath29 scheme , in which all correlations involving only @xmath29 or fewer spins are retained , but no further restriction is made concerning their spatial separation on the lattice ; ( 2 ) the sub@xmath29-@xmath30 sub - approximation , in which all sub@xmath29 correlations spanning a range of no more than @xmath30 adjacent lattice sites are retained ; and ( 3 ) the localised lsub@xmath30 scheme , in which all multi - spin correlations over all distinct locales on the lattice defined by @xmath30 or fewer contiguous sites are retained .",
    "a simple `` brute - force '' approach in order to solve the ccm equations in parallel is firstly to rearrange eqs .",
    "( [ ccm_eq7 ] ) and ( [ ccm_eq8 ] ) for the ket and bra states , respectively , where @xmath31 and where @xmath32 is the number of fundamental configurations . note that there are therefore @xmath32 equations for both @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which refer to the ket and bra states , respectively .",
    "we note that each equation contains a finite - number of terms and that , indeed , this is always the case for the ccm for hamiltonians that contain a finite number of creation and destruction operators .",
    "the `` brute - force '' approach is to iterate the set of equations in eq .",
    "( [ ccm_eq10 ] ) to convergence first in order to obtain the ket - state correlation coefficients .",
    "we then iterate the set of equations eq .",
    "( [ ccm_eq11 ] ) to convergence .",
    "this approach appears to function adequately as long as one is in the region where the model state is a good starting point .",
    "clearly , this approach will become more difficult as we approach any _ critical points _ in the ccm equations .",
    "a simple parallelisation technique is now to split the problem of determining and solving the @xmath32 equations for both the bra and ket states of eqs .",
    "( [ ccm_eq10 ] ) and ( [ ccm_eq11 ] ) between each processor in the parallel cluster .",
    "thus , each equation for @xmath35 is ever dealt with by one node in the cluster only and the results of each node are collected together at each iteration in the `` brute - force '' algorithm .",
    "( again , we remember that we iterate the ket - state equations first and then the bra - state equations . )",
    "thus , the set of equations for the ket and bra states are solved independently and in parallel .",
    "this approach has a number of advantages .",
    "firstly , we do not need to define a jacobian ( e.g. , as for the newton - raphson technique ) and so we save on ram by using this procedure .",
    "secondly , the task of evaluating and saving the ccm equations is reduced by a factor of the number of machines used . indeed , in our implementation we saved all of the data for a particular set of equations to disk locally on each machine , although we note that one could even re - derive the ccm equations as and when necessary in order to further reduce disk usage .",
    "finally , this a simple approach and so is easy to amend existing code and so be parallelised .",
    "this very simple approach was found to be surprisingly successful , although we note that the number of iterations for such a direct iteration method is at least an order of magnitude greater than that for the newton - raphson technique , for example .",
    "indeed , we were able to reproduce those results determined on a single machine up to the lsub7 level of approximation by using our parallelised implementation .",
    "this was found to be an excellent test of the validity of our results .",
    "however , we were able to solve the lsub8 approximation for the ground - state energy only by using parallel processing .",
    "we note that this approximation contained 10707 fundamental configurations and that this is twice as big as the previous `` largest '' ccm calculation for spin systems .",
    "we believe that further increases in the number of fundamental configurations by at least another order of magnitude might be possible even by using moderate levels of parallelisation ( e.g. , 10 or 20 nodes ) and for our `` brute - force '' approach .",
    "finally , we would wish to implement a more sophisticated solution of this problem using parallel processing in the future .",
    "a possible way of doing this would be to use plapack , for example , in order to implement the newton - raphson technique `` in parallel . ''",
    "other strategies might include numerical approximations to the jacobian for the newton - raphson technique or other less memory - intensive ways of determining and solving the ccm equations of eqs .",
    "( [ ccm_eq7 ] ) and ( [ ccm_eq8 ] ) .",
    "the spin - half @xmath36@xmath37 kagom model model is is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 runs over all nearest - neighbour ( n.n . ) bonds and @xmath40 runs over all next - nearest - neighbour ( n.n.n . )",
    "bonds on the kagom lattice .",

    "indeed , a variational calculation @xcite which utilised a dimerised basis also found that the ground state of the kaf is some sort of spin liquid .",

    "all results were determined using the parallelised approach and with a single processor , except for a single result for the ground - state energy at @xmath48 which contained 10707 fundamental configurations and which was only able to be carried out `` in parallel . ''",
    "our best estimate for the ground - state energy per spin of the spin - half kagom lattice antiferromagnet with nearest - neighbour terms only ( @xmath48 ) was @xmath1 .",
    "the increasing accuracy of the high - order ccm technique and its ability to be applied to even strongly frustrated systems ( such as the model considered here ) are strong advantages .",

    ", the use of existing codes would make this process simpler .",
    "such determination of the the excitation spectra of quantum spin systems using high - order ccm techniques might be made even more useful by the utilisation of `` non - nel '' model states .",
    "the model considered here uses just such a `` nel '' model state and typically we perform some kind of notational rotation of the spin axis such that all of the spin `` point downwards '' .",
    "this is then the starting point for our calculations .",
    "we note that non - nel model states ( such as the dimer solid state ) have already been used at low orders of approximation to consider spin systems which demonstrate novel ordering .",
    "it would again be a straightforward process to develop our high - order ccm approach for the `` localised '' approximation schemes in order to consider such non - nel model states .",
    "another extension of the current calculations is to bosonic or fermionic systems .",
    "indeed , the formalism has already been developed for lattice bosonic systems , which we note have much in common ( from a `` ccm notational '' point - of - view ) which large quantum spin number , @xmath60 , spin systems previously considered using high - order ccm techniques @xcite .",
    "the above calculations were presented for the infinite - lattice case , @xmath61 .",
    "we note that it is also possible to consider the case where @xmath62 is finite , and , again , high - order techniques would be invaluable here .",
    "the application of the ccm to quantum spin systems at non - zero temperature might also be accomplished in future . indeed ,",
    "the application of the ccm at both zero- and non - zero temperatures might help to explain the subtle interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in driving phase transitions over a wide range of physical parameters .",
