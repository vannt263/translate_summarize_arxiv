    "diatomic sulfur , s@xmath0 , has been subject of many theoretical and spectroscopic investigations for long time @xcite",
    ". we can find s@xmath0 molecules at various natural and industrial plasmas containing sulfur compounds .",
    "for example , emissions and absorptions of s@xmath0 molecules have been observed in the atmospheres of jupiter @xcite and its satellite io @xcite .",
    "they are also observed in the atmospheres of some comets @xcite . in industrial condition",
    ", s@xmath0 molecules can be seen in reactive ion etching process using sf@xmath4 molecules @xcite .",
    "sulfur lamps contain s@xmath0 molecules as an important ingredient @xcite .",
    "although electron collision with s@xmath0 molecules is an important elementary process in these plasmas , there has been little work on this subject .",
    "as far as we are aware , no experimental measurement nor theoretical calculation of electron - s@xmath0 elastic cross section have been performed .",
    "garrett et al .",
    "@xcite calculated integral cross section for electron impact excitation of the s@xmath0 b@xmath5 , 2@xmath5 and b@xmath6 states using the semiclassical impact - parameter ( ip ) method extended to include nuclear motion . since the ip method is designed to treat optically allowed transitions , electron impact excitation to the other electronic state was not investigated .",
    "le coat et al .",
    "@xcite performed experimental measurement on dissociative electron attachment of s@xmath0 molecules and identified two resonances , however , they did not present absolute value of the cross section .",
    "recently , we have performed the r - matrix calculations on the spin - exchange effect in electron collision with homo - nuclear open - shell diatomic molecules including s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the integral cross section of elastic electron collision with s@xmath0 molecules for the first time . here",
    ", we extend our previous study to the electron impact excitations of s@xmath0 molecules . since s@xmath0 molecule has a valence electron structure similar to o@xmath0 , comparison of the cross sections will be interesting .",
    "also , the cross section of electron impact excitation of the s@xmath0 b@xmath5 would be important in analyzing sulfur plasma .",
    "as in our previous works on electron impact excitation of o@xmath0 and n@xmath0 @xcite , we employ the fixed - nuclei r - matrix method using state - averaged complete active space scf molecular orbitals .",
    "the size of basis set for the scattering electron is slightly extended in this work compared to our previous calculation on the spin - exchange effect @xcite .",
    "the details of the r - matrix method has been described in the literature @xcite , thus we do not repeat general explanation of the method here .",
    "we used a modified version of the polyatomic programs in the uk molecular r - matrix codes @xcite in this work .",
    "these programs utilize the gaussian type orbitals ( gto ) to represent target electronic states as well as a scattering electron . in the present r - matrix calculations",
    ", we have included 13 target states ; @xmath7 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath3 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "these target states were represented by valence configuration interaction wave functions constructed by state averaged complete active space scf ( sa - casscf ) orbitals . in this study ,",
    "the sa - casscf orbitals were obtained by calculations with molpro suites of programs @xcite .",
    "the target orbitals were constructed from the cc - pvtz basis set@xcite .",
    "fixed - nuclei approximation was employed with inter - nuclear distance of 3.7 a@xmath17 .",
    "the radius of the r - matrix sphere was chosen to be 13 a@xmath17 in our calculations . in order to represent the scattering electron , we included diffuse gaussian functions up to @xmath18 = 5 , with 13 functions for @xmath18 = 0 , 11 functions for @xmath18 = 1 , 10 functions for @xmath18 = 2 , 8 functions for @xmath18 = 3 , 6 functions for @xmath18 = 4 and 5 functions for @xmath18 = 5 .",
    "exponents of these diffuse gaussians were taken from faure et al .",
    "in addition to these continuum orbitals , we included 8 extra virtual orbitals , one for each symmetry .",
    "the construction of the configuration state functions ( csfs ) for the electron - molecule system is the same as in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "note that the r - matrix calculations were performed for all 8 irreducible representations of the d@xmath19 symmetry , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in doublet and quartet spin multiplicities of the whole system .",
    "one of the transitions studied in this work , the excitation of the @xmath3 state from the ground state , is optically allowed .",
    "thus , we have to consider the effect of transition dipole moment between these two states .",
    "a lot of @xmath18 partial - waves has to be included in the r - matrix calculation to obtain converged cross sections because of the long - range interaction of the dipole , although it is difficult to include partial waves with @xmath28 in the usual ab initio r - matrix calculation . in this work ,",
    "the r - matrix calculations are performed with partial waves up to @xmath29 .",
    "the effects of the higher @xmath18 partial waves are included by the born closure approximation as in the previous works @xcite .",
    "following gibson et al.@xcite , we evaluate the differential cross sections ( dcss ) with the born correction , @xmath30 , by the expression , @xmath31.\\ ] ] here , @xmath32 is the dcs obtained by the first born approximation , @xmath33 is the cross section obtained by the r - matrix calculation and @xmath34 is the dcs from the first born approximation including the same number of partial waves as in the r - matrix calculation .",
    "@xmath34 is evaluated by the angular momentum representation of the t - matrix elements for the first born approximation .",
    "these t - matrix elements as well as @xmath32 are available in close form @xcite .",
    "the total cross sections are obtained by the integration of eq.(1 ) .",
    "in table [ tab1 ] , excitation energies of s@xmath0 molecule obtained from the casscf calculation in this work are compared with mrd ci vertical excitation energies of hess et al.@xcite , mrci adiabatic excitation energies of kiljunen et al.@xcite and experimental values quoted in hess et al .",
    "our results agree well with the previous calculations and experimental results for the lowest two excitations . for excitations to the higher electronic states , deviations in excitation energies",
    "become larger partly because of difference of adiabatic and vertical excitation energy .    in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the integral cross sections ( icss ) are shown for electron s@xmath0 elastic collision and excitations of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 states .",
    "the magnitude of the elastic ics is about 20 @xmath35 in low energy region below 3 ev , then it increases to be 30 @xmath36 at energies above 5 ev .",
    "the ics of the excitation to the @xmath1 state increases gradually from threshold to 8.5 ev , where it takes a maximum value of 0.35 @xmath35 , then it decreases again .",
    "the icss of the excitation to the @xmath2 and @xmath8 states also increase gradually from threshold . in both cases ,",
    "the maximum value of the ics is about 0.1 @xmath35 . around 2.7 ev , a sharp resonance peak with width 0.08",
    "ev exists in the icss of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 excitations .",
    "also , a kink structure is observed in the elastic ics at the same energy .",
    "all of these structure belongs to the @xmath37 symmetry partial cross sections .",
    "we analyzed the csfs and found that the kink and peaks at 2.7 ev are likely related to a resonance with configuration @xmath38 , which is obtained from an attachment of the scattering electron to the excited @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 states of s@xmath0 with configuration @xmath42 .",
    "the width of this resonance is about 0.08 ev at r = 3.7 a@xmath17 .",
    "we checked the behaviour of this resonance as a function of bond - length , and found that it approaches the atomic limit @xmath43 + @xmath44 .",
    "since the location of this resonance is higher than the atomic limit , dissociative electron attachment may occur through this resonance .    in figure [ fig2 ] ,",
    "the icss for electron s@xmath0 collisions are shown for excitations to the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath3 states .",
    "the ics of garrett et al .",
    "@xcite obtained by the impact - parameter method is also compared with our excitation ics to the @xmath3 state . in general , the slopes of these icss near threshold are steeper than those in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the maximum values of the icss below 15 ev are about 0.3 , 0.1 , 0.6 and 3.0 for the excitation to the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath3 states , respectively . for the optically allowed @xmath3 state excitation , the effect of the high @xmath18 partial waves is included by the born closure approximation formula given in eq.(1 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the born correction is small below 10 ev , however , it increases as the scattering energy increases .",
    "the fraction of the correction to the r - matrix cross section becomes about 20@xmath45 at 15 ev .",
    "our ics with the born correction and the previous result of garrett et al .",
    "@xcite agree reasonably well above 8 ev .",
    "we used the casscf value for the @xmath3 excitation energy in this work , whereas garrett et al .",
    "@xcite employed the experimental value for the excitation energy .",
    "in contrast to the fixed - nuclei approximation in our calculation , garrett et al .",
    "@xcite included the effect of s@xmath0 vibration in their calculation . because of these differences , the results of garrett et al .",
    "@xcite and our ics do not agree well near the excitation threshold .",
    "a small peak is seen at 14.2 ev in the icss of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 state excitations , which is originated from the @xmath46 symmetry partial cross sections .",
    "since the location of this peak is higher than the highest energy s@xmath0 electronic state included in the present r - matrix calculation , we can not determine whether this peak belongs to the real resonance or pseudo - resonance .    in figure[fig3",
    "] , the differential cross sections ( dcss ) are shown for elastic electron s@xmath0 collisions as well as excitations to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 states .",
    "the elastic dcss are enhanced in forward direction and tend to be more forward - enhanced as the scattering energy increases .",
    "in contrast to the elastic dcss , the excitation dcs to the @xmath1 state has backward - enhanced character in general .",
    "however , the magnitude of forward scattering cross section increases as the scattering energy increases from 7 to 13 ev .",
    "our excitation dcss to the @xmath2 state approach zero near 0 and 180 degrees , because of a selection rule associated with @xmath47-@xmath48 transition @xcite .",
    "around 90 degrees , the magnitude of the dcs is about 0.06@xmath490.08 @xmath50 and does not depend much on the scattering energy .",
    "the @xmath3 state excitation dcss are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] panel ( d ) .",
    "in addition to the r - matrix results , the dcss with the born correction obtained by eq.(1 ) are also shown for scattering angles below 25 degrees . for larger angles ,",
    "the magnitude of the correction is expected to be small and not shown here .",
    "the contribution of the born correction to the dcs is small for 7 ev , however , it dominates the total dcs near zero degree at 10 and 13 ev .",
    "although the magnitude of the r - matrix dcs at forward direction decreases as the scattering energy increases from 7 to 13 ev , the dcs with the born correction at forward direction increases as energy increases .",
    "the elastic and excitation cross sections of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states in electron s@xmath0 collisions are about two times larger than corresponding cross sections in electron o@xmath0 collisions studied in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath37 resonance peaks can be observed in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 excitation cross sections in both e - o@xmath0 and e - s@xmath0 collisions , the width of the peak is much broader in e - o@xmath0 case . in e - o@xmath0 elastic collision",
    ", a narrow @xmath51 resonance peak is seen below 1 ev . in e - s@xmath0 elastic case",
    ", the energy of the s@xmath52 @xmath51 state is stabilized below the energy of the s@xmath0 ground state and can not be observed in the cross section .",
    "other than these resonance features , the profiles of the cross sections are similar in e - o@xmath0 and e - s@xmath0 collisions .    in this work ,",
    "we employed the fix - bond approximation for the r - matrix calculation . in our previous studies on electron impact excitations of o@xmath0 and n@xmath0 molecules@xcite",
    ", we also used the same fix - bond approximation and got good agreement with available experimental results , even if the positions of the potential curve minimum are different between the ground state and the excited state .",
    "thus , the results of this study is also expected to be accurate enough . for more precise comparison of the excitation cross section of the @xmath3 state with the previous results of garrett et al .",
    "@xcite , inclusion of the vibrational effect may be necessary .",
    "such kind of calculation is possible by the non - adiabatic r - matrix method or the adiabatic averaging of the t - matrix elements , and will be performed in future .",
    "we have carried out the r - matrix calculations with the maximum @xmath18 quantum number 4 , 5 and 6 to check convergence . except for the @xmath3 state excitation ,",
    "the icss and dcss are converged at @xmath18=5 . for the @xmath3 excitation , the ics with the born correction",
    "is also converged at @xmath18=5 . for the @xmath3 excitation dcss with the born correction ,",
    "however , the convergence is achieved only below 25 degrees .",
    "note that the similar situation was observed in gibson et al.@xcite .",
    "although the @xmath3 excitation dcs is not converged above 30 degrees , the effect of the higher @xmath18 partial waves is expected to be small because the magnitude of the born dcs itself is small at larger scattering angles . in principle , this convergence problem can be solved @xcite by applying the born correction to t - matrix elements , where we applied the correction at the r - matrix dcs in this work .",
    "we will calculate this kind of born correction at t - matrix level when more accurate excitation dcs is required in future .",
    "in this work , we have studied the low - energy electron impact excitations of s@xmath0 molecules using the fixed - bond r - matrix method based on state - averaged casscf molecular orbitals .",
