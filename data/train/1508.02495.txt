    "molecular communications ( mc ) via diffusion is one of the most promising approaches for communications among nanonetworks @xcite . in this approach",
    ", information is conveyed to a nano - receiver by nano - transmitter s choice of the concentration , type , or the release time of the molecules diffused into the medium .",
    "the motion of the released molecules are described by a brownian motion process , that can be with or without drift .",
    "a molecule released from a transmitter can follow different trajectories before reaching a receiver .",
    "thus , diffusion - based communication suffers from intersymbol interference ( isi ) due to molecules from previous transmission that follow longer trajectories before hitting the receiver .    the effect of isi in diffusion based mc has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite , with the general conclusion that isi reduces the performance in a communication setup consisting of one transmitter and one receiver .",
    "the authors in @xcite have proposed two modulation schemes , _ concentration shift keying ( csk ) _ and _ molecular shift keying ( mosk ) _ , where both suffer from the isi caused by molecules from previous transmissions .",
    "authors in @xcite have proposed the _ molecular concentration shift keying ( mcsk ) _ modulation scheme , where the main idea is to use the distinct molecule types for consecutive time slots at the transmitter , thus effectively suppressing the isi . in @xcite",
    "the authors take advantage of a limited memory in the transmitter to propose an adaptive transmission rate scheme that reduces isi .",
    "an on - off mosk modulation scheme has been proposed in @xcite which increases the transmission rate compared to mosk but still suffers from the isi . in @xcite , a modulation , called run - length hybrid aware , has been presented , which considers the runs ( the same value occurs in several consecutive bits ) for encoding : the run - value is encoded in molecule type and the run - length is encoded by csk .",
    "though suffering from the isi , this scheme is stated to improve the transmission rate in comparison with csk and mosk considering the ideal channel with no transmission errors .",
    "authors in @xcite propose a pre - equalization method to mitigate isi where the signal at the receiver is considered as the difference between the number of the received molecules of each type while two types of molecules is used at the transmitter .",
    "further , several channel coding schemes are proposed to mitigate isi in diffusion based mc @xcite where they employ additional bits to intended input codewords in order to compensate errors from the isi or noisy channel .",
    "_ motivation for isi - free modulations : _ given the generally negative effect of isi , it is of interest to design modulation or channel coding schemes that would prevent or mitigate the isi . to mitigate the isi",
    ", the transmitter needs to make sure that molecules of the same type are released at time instances that are sufficiently far apart .",
    "therefore , the transmissions will not have any superposition .",
    "this simplifies the receiver , who monitors the presence and intensity of various molecule types in the environment .",
    "furthermore , isi - free modulation schemes are more robust when the receiver knows little about the channel state information ( csi )",
    ". a high receiver molecule intensity can be either due to a high transmission amplitude or a very conductive channel . in lack of csi and potential presence of isi , observing a certain intensity of a molecule type , the receiver has to meet the challenge of deciding whether the received molecule density is due to superposition of various successive transmissions or due to temporary channel conductivness .    in this paper",
    ", we study isi - free modulation schemes for time - slotted transmission model .",
    "the problem of finding the maximum achievable rate is converted into the design of a codebook , consisting of string of symbols , with each symobl indicating the type and concentration of a molecule transmission .",
    "the isi - free condition implies that symbols of the same type should not be used close to each other .",
    "this problem can be expressed in terms of the constrainted coding problem .",
    "constrained coding has found applications in storage and communication systems ; its basic idea is to avoid transmission of input sequences that are more prone to error ( e.g. see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 ) ) .",
    "similarly , in our setup , we would like to avoid input sequences that cause isi .",
    "acheiving the constrained coding capacity requires blocklengths tending to infinity and complicated coding schemes . on the other hand , due to the limited resources available at nano - level , only",
    "simple _ schemes are eligible for being implemented in practice .",
    "further , we desire short blocklengths ( limited delay ) and modest memory resources .",
    "our main contribution in this paper is to construct simple isi - free modulation schemes for a given maximum transmission delay .",
    "it is shown ( numerically ) these simple schemes are near optimal , _ i.e. , _ they become close to the constrained coding capacity .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ secii ] ,",
    "isi - free modulation is formally defined and modeled as a constraint graph .",
    "a summary of the notation used in this paper is given in table [ notation ] at the beginning of this section .",
    "section [ sec3 ] introduces the isi - free modulation capacity under the limited delay ( blocklength ) . in section [ sec4 ] a class of modulation strategies based on a modified version of the constraint graph",
    "is proposed as a lower bound on the capacity .",
    "the numerical results and conclusions are provided in section [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] respectively .",
    ".summary of the notation [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ rest ]",
    "we considered the problem of efficient rate isi - free modulation in molecular communication under limited delay constraints .",
    "the isi - free condition was expressed by a constrained graph where maximum achievable rate of modulations constructed over this graph , i.e , isi - free capacity , is well known in constrained coding literature .",
    "motivated by limited resources in nanomachines , we then defined the isi - free capacity under delay constraints , @xmath0 .",
    "afterwards , a suboptimal approach to determine the encoder and decoder functions ( modulation scheme ) that gives a lower bound on @xmath0 was proposed .",
    "the results show that these simple schemes are near optimal , i.e , become close to the constrained coding capacity .",
