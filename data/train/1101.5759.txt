    "the acceleration of charged particles to high energies in the solar corona is related to flares , which reveal the dissipation of magnetically stored energy in complex magnetic field structures of the low corona , and to coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , which are large - scale , complex magnetic - field - plasma structures ejected from the sun .",
    "cmes can drive bow shocks , and their perturbation of the coronal magnetic field can also give rise to magnetic reconnection , where energy can be released in a similar way as during flares .",
    "when several cmes are launched along the same path , a faster cme may overtake a slower preceding one , and the two cmes can merge into a single structure .",
    "for this phenomenon @xcite introduced the term _ cme cannibalism_. the cme - cme interaction was found associated with a characteristic low - frequency continuum radio emission .",
    "@xcite interpreted this type of activity as the radio signature of non - thermal electrons originating either during reconnection between the two cmes or as the shock of the second , faster cme travels through the body of the first ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a numerical study of two interacting coronal mass ejections ) .",
    "in this paper we use radio diagnostics to study electron acceleration during a complex solar event broadly consisting of two stages , each associated with a distinct episode of a flare and with a fast cme , which occurred in close temporal succession on 17 january 2005 .",
    "the cmes interacted at a few tens of r@xmath0 . both the flare / cme events and the cme interaction were accompanied by radio emission , which is used here to study electron acceleration scenarios .",
    "energetic electrons in the corona and interplanetary space are traced by their dm - to - km - wave radio emission , mostly excited at or near the electron plasma frequency .",
    "the emission provides a diagnostic of the type of the exciter and its path from the low corona ( cm - dm wavelengths ) to 1  au ( km wavelengths ) .",
    "radio emissions from exciters moving through the corona appear in dynamic spectra as structures exhibiting a drift in the time  frequency domain .",
    "the drift rate depends on their speed and path , resulting in a variety of bursts .",
    "type  iii bursts trace the path of supra ",
    "thermal electrons guided by magnetic structures .",
    "they appear , on dynamic spectra , as short ( lasting from a fraction of a second at dm - waves to a few tens of minutes at km - waves ) structures with fast negative drift , ( @xmath1 ;  see for example   * ? ? ?",
    "this corresponds to anti - sunward propagation of the electrons through regions of decreasing ambient density at speeds @xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "sunward travelling beams produce reverse drift bursts ( rs bursts ) , and beams propagating in closed loops emit type u or j bursts comprising a succession of an initial drift towards lower frequencies and a more or less pronounced rs burst .",
    "type  ii bursts are more slowly drifting bursts ( @xmath3 ;  see , for example , table a.1 in   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) excited by electrons accelerated at travelling shocks and emitting in their upstream region . finally broadband dm - m wave continuum emission that may last over several minutes or even hours ( type iv burst ) is ascribed to electrons confined in closed coronal magnetic structures .",

    "the most conspicuous event was a 3b  h@xmath6  flare reported by kanzelhhe 09:16 - 11:57 ut .",

    "two major flare ribbons are distinguished in the snapshot at 09:13  ut : a narrow band essentially in the east - west direction and a broader north - southward oriented region .",
    "the significant offset of the two ribbons with respect to the neutral line shows the eruption of a strongly sheared magnetic field .",

    "the brightening consisted of two essentially parallel flare ribbons , which were connected by post flare loops in later snapshots ( not shown here ) .",
    "these two stages of the event were also found in the soft x - ray ( sxr ) and radio emissions , as will be discussed below .",
    "two cmes were observed in close succession .",
    "a sequence of difference images from the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) aboard the soho spacecraft @xcite is displayed in figure  [ cmes ] : the first cme ( henceforth cme@xmath5 ) is seen in the image at 09:30  ut in the north - western quadrant . while it travelled through the corona , the second , broader cme ( cme@xmath8 ) appeared underneath ( image at 09:54  ut ) .",
    "the most conspicuous features of both cmes are seen above the north - western limb , but both were labelled halo cmes in the lasco cme catalog @xcite .",
    "speeds of , respectively , 2094 and 2547  km  s@xmath7 were derived from linear fits to the trajectories of their fronts published in the cme catalogue .",
    "formally the cme fronts described by the fits intersected near 12:32  ut at a heliocentric distance of about 38  r@xmath0 .",
    "the statistical error of the speeds of the cme fronts and their liftoff times , derived from the abovementioned linear least - squares fit to the measured heliocentric distances , leads to an uncertainty of @xmath103  h in the time of intersection .",
    "this uncertainty stems from the fact that the two height - time trajectories are nearly parallel .",
    "we will show in sect .",
    "[ cme2cme ] that cme interaction actually occurred well before the formal time of intersection .",
    "of course a single instant of interaction between two complex cmes is fictitious anyway .",
    "an overview of the complex radio event is given in figure  [ f3 ] .",

    "several other time histories are superposed on the dynamic spectrum :    * dashed lines display the approximate frequency - time trajectories of the two cme fronts , using the density model of @xcite , which describes well the coronal density behavior in the large range of distances from low corona to interplanetary space : @xmath12 + the linear fits to the height - time trajectories of the cme fronts in the lasco images were converted to frequency - time tracks of fundamental ( black line ) and harmonic ( red line ) plasma emission . *",

    "the red curve is the microwave time history at 15.4  ghz , produced by non thermal electrons ( energies @xmath13100  kev ) in magnetic fields of a few hundred  g ; these were obtained from the san vito solar observatory of the radio solar telescope network ( rstn ) @xcite .",
    "the two stages of the flare identified in the h@xmath6  observations in figure  [ fig_kanz ] correspond to two distinct events of energy release seen in the sxr and microwave time profiles ( figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "the sxr time profile had an initial smooth increase between 06:59  ut and 09:05  ut . subsequently the sxr flux rose slightly faster until 09:45  ut ( stage 1 ) , and even faster ( stage 2 ) until the x3.8 peak at 09:52  ut . the gradual rise in stage 1 and",
    "the faster rise in stage 2 were each accompanied by strong microwave bursts .",
    "the second burst was also observed in hard x - rays by rhessi  @xcite .",
    "the dominant features in the dynamic spectrum observed by _",
    "wind_/waves at frequencies below 2  mhz are two groups of type  iii bursts , labelled iii@xmath5 and iii@xmath8 .",
    "they occurred in association with the sxr and microwave emissions of stages 1 and 2 , respectively , and with the two different parts of the h@xmath6 flare .",
    "the two type  iii groups occurred near the extrapolated liftoff times of the two cmes .",
    "radio images taken by the nanay radioheliograph ( nrh ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the sources are located in the north - western quadrant near the flaring active region .",
    "hence both flare episodes were efficient accelerators of electrons that escaped to the interplanetary space along open magnetic field lines rooted at or near the flare site .",
    "the second type  iii group ( type iii@xmath8 ) was followed by a more slowly drifting narrow - band burst ( type ii , labelled ii@xmath8 ) produced by a coronal shock wave . upon closer inspection",
    "the spectrum suggests that similar drifting features can also be associated with the first flare episode , although the association is less evident .",
    "we label these bursts ii@xmath5 in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "since the two cmes are extremely fast , they are expected to drive shock waves in the corona .",
    "the observed type ii emission can be compared with the dashed curves in figure [ f3 ] , which track fundamental ( black ) and harmonic ( red ) emission expected from the trajectory of the cme front and the coronal density model .",
    "it is clear that this density model is only indicative , especially in the perturbed corona through which travels the second cme ( see discussion in subsection [ m ] ) .",
    "we therefore associate type ii@xmath5 and ii@xmath8 to the bow shocks of the two cmes , although other interpretations , like shocks on the flanks or shocks from a driver related to the flare , are not excluded .",
    "the dm - m wave emission consisted of a type  iv continuum , the metre wave counterparts of the dekametre - hectometre ( dh ) type  iii groups and of the type ii bursts .",
    "the type  iv continuum started near 08:40  ut during the initial smooth increase of the sxr flux before stage  1 .",
    "it was first visible as a grey background in the dynamic spectrum , and became progressively more intense .",
    "it dominated the metre wave spectrum during and after type iii@xmath8 , and gradually penetrated to lower frequencies , down to 5  mhz .",
    "images in the eit 195   channel @xcite and in the 164 - 432 mhz range taken by the nrh indicate that the thermal ( soft x - rays ) and non thermal ( radio ) emissions all originated near noaa ar  10720 . in the time interval from the start of the type iv burst to the start of stage 1 a wealth of fine structures was recorded ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the high - resolution observations in the 200 - 500 mhz range ( see figures [ fs1 ] , [ fs2 ] for example ) it appears that most bursts are broadband pulsations .",
    "other fine structures of type  iv emission such as spikes , fiber bursts and zebra pattern appear occasionally ( see * ? ? ? * for a description of fine structure of type  iv emission ) .    during type iii@xmath5",
    "the spectral character of the radio emission was clearly different at frequencies below and above the inferred frequency - time track of the cme@xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . on the low - frequency side of the track strong type iii bursts were prominent after about 09:22  ut .",
    "they were preceded by a less regular emission , which @xcite label  complex type  iii bursts \" because of its varying flux density across the spectrum .",
    "the metre wave counterpart on the high - frequency side of the estimated cme track consisted of a succession of spectral fine structures on the time scale of seconds , with different spectral characteristics superposed on the type  iv continuum , followed after 09:11  ut by the high - frequency extension of the dekametre - hectometre ( dh ) type  iii group iii@xmath5 .",
    "a more detailed view of the difference spectrum is given in the top panel of figure  [ f4 ] , while high resolution images of the fine structures are in figure [ fs1 ] . among these fine structures were broadband pulsations , bursts with ordinary and reverse drift , and fiber bursts due to whistlers travelling upwards in the corona ( see figure [ fs1 ] , _",
    "e.g. _ , 09:16:20 - 09:16:45  ut ) .",
    "the variety of these bursts shows the acceleration and partial trapping of electron populations in the corona well behind the front of the cme .",
    "indeed , few of the well - identified bursts above 100  mhz seem to continue into the 30 - 70  mhz range .",
    "it was only near the end of type iii@xmath5 ( @xmath11 08:18 ut ) that metre wave type  iii bursts appeared as systematic high - frequency extensions of the type  iii bursts observed below 2  mhz .",
    "type iii@xmath8 started at 09:43 ut , together with the second microwave burst , near the back - extrapolated lift - off of cme@xmath8 ( 09:38 ut ) and the onset of stage 2 of the sxr burst .",
    "a close look at the dynamic spectrum ( bottom panel of figure  [ f4 ] ) reveals negative overall drifts below 100  mhz , while burst groups with positive overall drift prevailed above 130  mhz .",
    "the high - resolution spectrogram in the 300 - 400 mhz range ( fig .",
    "[ fs2 ] ) shows a wealth of individual bursts with different drift rates and zebra pattern .",
    "these bursts show again , like in stage  1 of the event , that the high - frequency bursts are produced by an accelerator below the cme front , while low - frequency bursts show the start of the prominent dh type  iii bursts .",
    "well after the decay of the sxr and microwave emission a third group of bursts ( iii@xmath9 in figure  [ f3 ] ) is identified ( near 11:30 ut ) , with unusually low starting frequency ( 0.6 mhz ) , pointing to an acceleration of the emitting electrons at unusually great height . a more detailed view of the low - frequency radio spectrum of this burst group and the preceding groups iii@xmath5 and iii@xmath8 is given by the dynamic spectrum as observed by the _ thermal noise receiver _ ( tnr ) of _ wind_/waves in the left panel of figure  [ fig_tnr_20050117 ]",
    ". the narrow - band short bursts near 32  khz are langmuir wave packets .",
    "together with the fainter continuous band on which they are superposed they indicate how the electron plasma frequency evolves at the _ wind _ spacecraft . at the time of iii@xmath9 it is about 35  khz . using a standard interplanetary density model , where the electron plasma frequency decreases as the inverse of the heliocentric distance  @xmath14",
    ", the starting frequency of iii@xmath9 implies @xmath15  r@xmath0 for fundamental plasma emission , and @xmath16  r@xmath0 for the harmonic . from the lasco observations and the uncertainties resulting from the straight - line fits to the cme front trajectories , the heliocentric distances of the cme fronts at 11:30",
    "ut are , respectively , @xmath17  r@xmath0 and @xmath18  r@xmath0 .",
    "the burst group iii@xmath9 is hence consistent with harmonic emission from the vicinity of the cme fronts .",
    "this points to a close relationship of this episode of electron acceleration with the interaction of the two cmes .",
    "comparison of the three groups of type  iii bursts in the tnr spectrum of figure  [ fig_tnr_20050117 ] shows that type iii@xmath9 is much shorter than the previous type  iii bursts .",
    "it has intrinsic structure that indicates a group of bursts .",
    "the low - frequency cutoff is near the plasma frequency at the spacecraft at that time .",
    "more details are seen in the selected time profiles in the right panel , plotted together with the peak times of the burst at each frequency in the 35 - 256 khz range ( open triangles ) .",
    "the time profiles show that the peak times are not distinguishable over a large part of the frequency spectrum with 1-min integrated data , but that the centre of gravity of the brightest feature shifts to later times at the lower frequencies .",
    "we determined the maximum of the burst at each of the tnr frequencies where it is well defined , using a parabolic interpolation between the observed maximum and its two neighbours .",
    "it is this interpolated time which is plotted by an open triangle .",
    "the peak time spectrum resembles a type iii burst especially at the lower frequencies .",
    "the peak time delay is merely 1  min between 250 and 50  khz , but becomes clear at frequencies below 50  khz . for comparison ,",
    "the peak time delay between 50 and 250  khz is 42 min during the previous burst iii@xmath8 .",
    "the frequency drift rate is hence faster than 3  khz / s during iii@xmath9 , as compared to 0.08  khz / s  during iii@xmath8 . because of the morphological similarity in the dynamic spectrum , and despite the different drift rates , we assume in the following that the type iii@xmath9 bursts are indeed produced by electron beams travelling in the anti - sunward direction from the acceleration region .",
    "since the emission extends rapidly to the plasma frequency at the spacecraft , we conclude that the electron beams do not travel within the cmes , but escape rapidly from the acceleration region in the vicinity of the cme fronts to 1  au .",
    "this means that they must travel along pre - existing open solar wind field lines .    to the extent",
    "that drift rates reflect the speed of the exciter , the fast frequency drift of the type iii@xmath9 bursts implies that the exciter speed is higher than during the preceding groups iii@xmath5 and iii@xmath8 .    the total and differential radio spectrum observed by _ wind_/waves are shown in figure  [ iii3 ] .",
    "the spectrum shows a chain of narrow - band emissions with negative frequency drift , indicating the type  ii bursts , followed by the high - frequency part of type iii@xmath9 between 11:28 and 11:40 ut . the spectrum in figure  [ f3 ] leaves it open if this is the continuation of the first type  ii burst ( ii@xmath5 ) , presumably associated with cme@xmath5 , or whether it contains contributions from both cmes .",
    "the starting frequency of the type  iii bursts is similar to the type  ii frequency when extrapolated to the time of the type  iii bursts .",
    "this is consistent with the type iii electron beams radiating in the upstream region , like the shock - acclerated electrons emitting the type  ii burst .",
    "one may go one step further and consider this coincidence as a hint that the electron beams are accelerated at the shock , as argued in cases where type  iii bursts clearly emanate from type  ii lanes ( see   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will come back to this problem in the discussion .",
    "the energetic particle data were obtained from the _ advanced composition explorer _ ( ace ) spacecraft .",
    "we use high - resolution intensities of magnetically deflected electrons ( de ) in the energy range 38 - 315 kev measured by the b detector of the ca60 telescope of the epam experiment ( _ electron , proton and alpha monitor _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board ace , and measurements of the angular distributions in the energy range 45 - 312 kev detected by the sunward looking telescope lefs60 . in figure  [ o1 ] ( top )",
    "an overview of the 20-min averaged differential intensities of four channels is presented for the interval 15 - 20 january 2005 .",
    "ar  10720 produced numerous solar events prior to as well as on 17 january 2005 @xcite ; in response to this solar activity , a sequence of energetic electron intensity enhancements was observed .",
    "the electron intensities are observed to reach their maximum values during this period following the solar events on 17 january 2005 .",
    "figure  [ o1 ] ( bottom ) shows 1-min averaged deflected electron intensities ( 38 - 315 kev ) for the time interval 04:00 - 20:00 ut on 17 january 2005 .",
    "the intensities measured during the time interval 04:00 - 08:00 ut for each electron channel have been averaged to obtain a pre - event background ( denoted by horizontal lines in figure  [ o1 ] ) .",
    "we defined the onset time of the event at ace for all energy channels as the time when the intensities get @xmath19 above the background and continue to rise from then on . using this criterion",
    ", we found the first significant rise of the electron intensities to occur at 10:00  ut .",
    "no velocity dispersion was observed , probably because the high pre - event ambient intensities ( see top panel figure  [ o1 ] ) mask the onset of the electron event ( see * ? ? ? * for a similar case ) .",
    "the spiky increase observed at about 10:40 ut is probably due to x - ray contamination .",
    "we found no evidence of a magnetic structure influencing the intensity profiles , which indicates the observed time intensity changes are not due to spatial structures crossing over the spacecraft , but are most likely dominated by temporal effects .",
    "twenty - minute averaged representative snapshots of pitch angle distributions ( pads ) are shown as inserts in the bottom panel of figure  [ o1 ] .",
    "normalized differential electron intensity is plotted versus the cosine of the pitch angle .",
    "statistically significant pads are detected first at about 11:00 ut .",
    "the pad snapshot denoted as * a * in figure  [ o1 ] indicates that immediately after the onset of the event unidirectional electron anisotropies are observed .",
    "based on the observations available we can not distinguish whether the electrons were directed sunward or antisunward , since the magnetic field ( not shown ) was directed dominantly transverse to the radial direction during this period ( see figure 7 in   * ? ? ?",
    "*  for a similar case ) .",
    "however , it is highly likely that the observed electrons are streaming away from the sun in response to the intense solar activity during this period .",
    "furthermore the type iii bursts clearly indicate that electrons stream away from the sun ( towards regions of lower density )",
    ". we can not be certain that the electron population measured at ace / epam is the high - energy counterpart of the electron beams emitting the radio waves , yet the overall timing suggests this .    in the work by @xcite a detailed analysis of the plasma and magnetic field measurements at 1 au by ace during the period 16 - 26 january 2005 was carried out .",
    "this includes the period under study in the present paper .",
    "a forward shock was detected at 07:12 ut on 17 january 2005 .",
    "we have denoted the arrival time of this shock by a vertical solid line in figure [ o1 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the analysis has shown that after the passage of this shock an unusually extended region exhibiting sheath - like characteristics is observed for  @xmath11  1.5 day with highly variable magnetic field magnitude and directions and typical to high proton temperatures ( see figure 3 of   * ? ? ?",
    "*  also ruth skoug , ace / swepam pi team , private communication ) .",
    "this region is probably related to two cmes ejected in close temporal sequence at the sun on 15 january ( see figure 2 of   * ? ? ?",
    "subsequently , at @xmath11 23:00 ut on 18 january 2005 the arrival of an icme at earth is detected , ending at about 02:30 ut on 20 january .",
    "the energetic electrons observed at 1 au analyzed in this work were thus detected in the region with disturbed magnetic field characteristics following the shock on 17 january 2005 .",
    "for the purposes of this work , as an approximation , we calculated that the nominal parker spiral for the measured solar wind speed of 620 @xmath20 ( ace / swepam ) at the time of the rise of the electron intensity had a length of about 1.05 au and was rooted near w 37@xmath4 on the hypothetical solar wind source surface at 2.5  r@xmath0 .",
    "this longitude is not contradictory with an active region at w 25@xmath4 , because non - radial coronal field lines can easily establish a connection @xcite .",
    "supposing that the early rise of the intensities was produced by the faster electrons in an energy channel moving along the interplanetary field line with 0 pitch angle , we estimate a travel time of about 15  min , which indicates the electrons were released from about 09:45 ut at the sun .",
    "this corresponds to a photon arrival time at 09:53  ut . given that our estimate of the electron rise gives only an upper limit , we consider that this electron release is related to type iii@xmath5 and type iii@xmath8 ( table [ t ] ) , but can not give a more detailed identification .",
    "the electron intensities are subsequently observed to exhibit a significant and more abrupt rise at all energies .",
    "extrapolation of this second rise to the pre - event background intensities indicates a start at @xmath11 12:00 ut .",
    "the electron pads ( inset * b * in figure  [ o1 ] ) indicate stronger unidirectional anisotropies are observed in association with this electron enhancement , which provides evidence for fresh injection of energetic electrons between the sun and the spacecraft .",
    "the outstanding radio emission near this time is the group of fast type  iii bursts during the cme interaction , type iii@xmath9 .",
    "if the electrons are accelerated at a heliocentric distance of about 25 r@xmath0 , the path travelled to the spacecraft along the nominal parker spiral is 0.92 au for the solar wind speed measured at the time of type iii@xmath9 ( 800 km / s ) .",
    "the inferred upper limit of the solar release time is 11:46 ut for 100 kev electrons .",
    "photons released at that time at 25 r@xmath0(0.12 au ) will reach the earth about 7 min later . since the high background implies that our estimations of the electron rise times are upper limits",
    ", we consider that this timing is consistent with the type iii@xmath9 burst group near 11:37 ut ( table [ t ] ) .",
    "this process is hence accompanied by the acceleration of copious amounts of electrons that escape to the vicinity of the earth .",
    "on 17 january 2005 two flare / cme events occurred in close temporal succession in the same active region .",
    "both cmes had very high projected speed , above 2000  km  s@xmath7 , but the second one was faster than the first and eventually overtook it .",
    "the cmes were associated with two successive filament eruptions and  sxr enhancements in the same active region .",
    "since the filament eruptions occurred at neighbouring places in the parent active region , the cmes probably resulted from the eruption of neighbouring parts of the same overall magnetic configuration .",
    "the soft x - ray characteristics of the two successive events were different : a slow monotonic rise to moderate flux during the first event , and a more impulsive rise to the x3.8 level ( @xmath21 ) during the second .",
    "both events had a conspicuous microwave burst , but the first one was stronger than the second , contrary to the soft x - rays .",
    "the second burst was also seen in hard x - rays by rhessi , which was in the earth s shadow during the first burst .",
    "[ [ evidence - for - evolving - acceleration - regions - in - the - corona - during - the - flares ] ] evidence for evolving acceleration regions in the corona during the flares ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the decametre - to - hectometre wave spectra in the two stages looked similar , with bright groups of type  iii bursts signalling the escape of electron beams at heliocentric distances beyond 2  @xmath22 .",
    "but radio emission from lower heights shows distinctive differences that point to an evolving acceleration region , _",
    "i.e _ either an acceleration region which progresses through the corona or a number of acceleration sites activated in succession .",
    "shock acceleration was clearly at work during both stages of the flare , as shown by the type  ii emission .",
    "the strong type  iii bursts at the low - frequency side of the estimated spectral track of the cme front could also be ascribed to the acceleration at the type  ii shock .",
    "the presence of type  iii bursts with negative drift at higher frequencies and the fine structures of the type  iv continuum show , however , that at the time when the shock traveled through the high corona , other acceleration regions were active at lower altitude , as is usually the case during complex type  iii bursts at decametre and longer waves ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the type  iii bursts ( iii@xmath5 ) might then not start near the cme front , but at higher frequencies , and be interrupted by interactions of the electron beams with the turbulence near the front of cme@xmath5 .",
    "this is a frequently quoted interpretation of complex features in type  iii bursts , both at kilometric @xcite and decametric wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the second type iii group",
    "( iii@xmath8 ) the overall frequency drift of the low - resolution spectrum ( figure [ f4 ] ) was positive .",
    "the persistence of the metric type  iv burst , which suggested acceleration in the lower corona rather than at the shock during the first stage , is again a likely indication of an accelerator that was distinct from the cme shock , and acted in addition to the shock , at lower altitude .",
    "this is consistent with an interpretation of the electron acceleration in terms of reconnection in the corona behind the cme @xcite .",
    "new evidence for this interpretation has recently been provided by @xcite using uv and white light coronographic diagnostics along with radio data .",
    "decametric - hectometric radio emission as a signature of cme interaction was discussed in some detail in two event studies @xcite . in both events the radio emission had a limited bandwidth , and",
    "was referred to as a continuum . in the present case",
    "this emission is likely a set of type  iii bursts and was therefore labelled type  iii@xmath9 .",
    "the starting frequency and the timing of these bursts are consistent with the idea that the electrons are accelerated while the faster following cme catches up with the slower preceding one .",
    "the association of cme interaction with particle acceleration has been ascribed by @xcite to acceleration by the shock of the second cme as it traverses the previous one .",
    "problems of this interpretation were discussed by @xcite .",
    "another important question is how the preceding cme could lead to a strengthening of the shock of the following one .",
    "this problem is still more evident in the 17 january 2005 event , because here the two cmes are already extremely fast and likely to drive strong shocks even in the ambient solar wind .",
    "their relative speed , however , is rather slow , so that efficient acceleration by the shock of the second cme is not expected in the first cme .",
    "another important feature is that the type iii@xmath9 bursts extend to the plasma frequency at the spacecraft .",
    "the electrons hence can not propagate in closed magnetic structures related to the cmes .",
    "the accelerator must release the electron beams onto open solar wind - type field lines .",
    "an alternative scenario to acceleration at the cme shock is again magnetic reconnection .",
    "one can surmise that these rapid cmes were preceded by sheath regions with strong magnetic fields of interplanetary origin , draped around the cme front .",
    "these regions are favourable for magnetic reconnection ( see the overview by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the high pressure in the sheath of the second cme will be further enhanced when its progression is slowed down by the previous cme .",
    "this makes the configuration favourable to magnetic reconnection involving open solar wind field lines and strong magnetic fields , and allows one to understand qualitatively why accelerated electrons escape immediately towards the outer heliosphere .    in this scenario",
    "the type  iii emission is expected to start close to the cme , in the upstream region .",
    "this can explain why the starting frequency is close to the frequency of the type  ii burst , without implying that the electron beams were themselves accelerated at the shock .",
    "the flare / cme events under discussion were clearly related with enhanced fluxes of near - relativistic electrons at 1 au .",
    "the peak intensity measured by ace , of order @xmath23 in the 38 - 53 kev range , make the event comparable to the most intense ones of the sample studied by @xcite , as seen in their figure  3a .",
    "the cme speed is well above the speeds of the cmes identified in that sample @xcite .",
    "since the energetic electrons were observed at 1 au within the region exhibiting sheath - like characteristics following the shock on 17 january 2005 , it is difficult to estimate electron travel times and to relate the _ in situ _ measurements to solar processes .",
    "but the observations strongly suggest that successive intensity increases are first due to the coronal acceleration in the flare / cme event , and then to an episode during the interaction of the two cmes .",
    "the escape of these electrons to ace confirms the view discussed above that the electrons can not have been accelerated in the body of the first cme , even if a shock driven by the second one passed through it .",
    "neither can they originate from reconnection between closed magnetic field lines of the two cmes .",
    "the electrons must rather be accelerated in regions from where they have ready access to solar wind magnetic field lines .",
    "this is consistent with a common acceleration of the mildly relativistic electrons and the electron beams at lower energies that produce the type iii@xmath9 emission .",
