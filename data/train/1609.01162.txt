    "most galaxy surveys to date have been limited by a combination of apparent magnitude and surface - brightness ( sb ) constraints .",
    "this has led to an over - representation of luminous high - sb galaxies compared to a complete volume - limited sample @xcite .",
    "generally , flux - limited samples have been used to construct our picture of galaxy types , e.g. , the hubble tuning fork @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of galaxies are , in fact , low - luminosity or low - mass ` dwarfs ' @xcite .",
    "whilst many are late - type spirals , they often do not fit neatly into the ` tuning fork ' .",
    "dwarf galaxies have , for example , been classified as : irregulars @xcite , dwarf ellipticals @xcite , dwarf spheroidals @xcite , blue compact dwarfs @xcite , little blue spheroids @xcite , blue diffuse dwarfs @xcite , and ultra diffuse galaxies @xcite .    @xmath6 cold dark matter ( @xmath6cdm ) simulations have been used to make predictions for the number density of low - mass galaxies . when compared to observations",
    "these simulations show a discrepancy , known as the substructure problem @xcite , which can be characterised in two distinct ways .",
    "the first is the so - called missing satellite problem : the deficiency of the number of observed satellites , around the milky way in particular , compared to the number of sub - halos predicted by models @xcite .",
    "the second deals with the discrepancy between the predicted number of halos and observed galaxies on a cosmological scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there has been progress towards reducing the discrepancy between simulations and observations in the local group with the discovery of many faint dwarf galaxies around the milky way @xcite and m31 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the number of galaxies in simulations can be reduced by , for example , changing cold dark matter to warm dark matter @xcite , or by suppression of dwarf galaxy formation from a photo - ionizing background @xcite .    unlike their satellite counterparts , which have a more complex and turbulent formation history , field dwarf galaxies form and evolve in isolation .",
    "despite processes such as supernova feedback @xcite and heating from the cosmic ionising background radiation @xcite , they generally have a larger cool gas fraction and higher star formation rate than those dwarfs that are gravitationally bound to a larger system . instead of being stripped away",
    ", most of their gas can cool back into the system @xcite .",
    "thus , the simulations and observations of low - mass field galaxies test a different regime to satellite galaxies",
    ".    there is currently a significant difference in the number density of low - mass systems ( @xmath7 ) between observations and simulations .",
    "for instance @xcite , through the use of simulations , predicted a number density of 0.1 mpc@xmath8 dex@xmath9 .",
    "currently the best observations put that number density at @xmath10 0.02 mpc@xmath8 dex@xmath9 within this mass range , from @xcite using the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey .",
    "therefore , observations must push to deeper magnitudes , and lower masses , in order to test whether observational sb limits are the reason , or part of the reason , for the discrepancy .",
    "the detection of faint low - mass galaxies is challenging , dwarf systems have an intrinsically lower surface brightness than their higher - mass counterparts and so are more difficult to detect against the sky @xcite . a typical definition in the literature for low - surface - brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) is to have a central surface brightness of @xmath11 mag arcsec@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this surface brightness makes them difficult to detect against the sky and leads to detection biases @xcite .",
    "finding lsbgs is thus key to accounting for , and characterising , the dwarf galaxy populations of both satellites and isolated galaxies .",
    "a full accounting is needed to comprehensively test models of galaxy formation that include low - mass galaxies .",
    "there are different environments to consider when searching for lsbgs and these environments can be broadly defined as : ( i ) nearby satellite galaxies within the local group ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; ( ii ) satellites in external groups and clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; and ( iii ) field galaxies away from luminous galaxies and clusters , or within a random cosmological volume .",
    "compared to the local group , where stars can be resolved , and around luminous galaxies and in clusters , where deep imaging is more easily done and membership is more easily assigned , finding lsbgs in the field is more problematic .",
    "a large area of the sky needs to be covered in order to obtain a cosmologically representative sample .",
    "this means that a lower depth is obtained in the imaging compared with targeted cluster surveys given the same amount of observing time .",
    "in addition , redshifts need to be obtained for galaxies in order to assign distances @xcite .",
    "to improve detection of these systems , specialised algorithms can be used to find lsbgs in images from wide surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used sdss data to search for galaxies of large angular size recovering most of the lsbgs from the @xcite catalogue .",
    "fainter features can be found by coadding images paying careful attention to sky subtraction @xcite ; and/or known galaxies can be masked out , meaning specialised algorithms can be applied to the images to search for fainter light from lsbgs that were not initially detected @xcite .",
    "similar techniques , including smoothing of masked images , can be used to search for low - sb tidal features @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a search of the sdss data to search for galaxies with similar morphology to leo  p @xcite , which has embedded h  regions within a blue diffuse galaxy , and were able to detect @xmath12 of these sources .",
    "star - forming dwarf galaxies dominate the field dwarf population @xcite .",
    "therefore they can be detected using radio h  surveys , such as the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because they typically have high h  to stellar mass ratios @xcite .",
    "the searching of optical images is then eased considerably , by knowing where to look , for example : @xcite and @xcite have confirmed many hundreds of new lsbgs based on their h  detections , mostly in the field ; @xcite confirmed five new blue diffuse dwarf galaxies within 10 mpc , associated with ` high - velocity clouds ' found in alfalfa data ; and @xcite , using a blind h  survey ( galfa - h , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , were able to detect two more faint diffuse galaxies , again within 10 mpc .",
    "the galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) is a fundamental tool used in studying the demographics of galaxies @xcite .",
    "it describes the number density of galaxies as a function of their mass within a volume of the universe .",
    "the gama survey team has accurately described the gsmf down to @xmath13 .",
    "the current incarnation , however , is likely incomplete at masses below this due to sb limits @xcite . as such , in order to push below this limit it is important to carry out a search of the sdss dr7 data within the gama fields .",
    "sdss data have been chosen for this work as this survey has already demonstrated its suitability for finding low - sb systems @xcite .",
    "the gama survey has made significant progress towards uncovering and classifying the dwarf population .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that the most common type of galaxy in the universe is likely star - forming dwarf galaxies rather than passive .",
    "@xcite measured the contribution of ` little blue spheroids ' , sd spirals and irregulars to the low - mass and low - luminosity number densities .",
    "@xcite showed that star - forming dwarf galaxies formed a unimodal population using various photometric and derived properties .",
    "however , progress still needs to be made into the search for , and detection of , lsbgs within this survey to work towards completing the census of galaxies .",
    "this search is complicated , and the method employed depends on the type of data that is provided and the nature of the objects being searched for .",
    "the distance range desired for the detection of lsbgs in this paper is around 10 to 100mpc , which places them beyond the range of the local group and volume @xcite .",
    "the volume out to 100mpc over the gama equatorial fields is 18000mpc@xmath14 .",
    "this is more cosmologically representative than studies in the local volume ( @xmath15mpc ) because of the larger volume and longer sight lines that cut through filaments and void - like regions .",
    "a specialised detection algorithm was developed to detect lsbgs , which are difficult to detect because of sky noise and artefacts .",
    "this paper deals with the method for the creation and implementation of such a search algorithm to find these lsbgs within sdss imaging , with comparisons to vista kilo - degree infrared galaxy survey ( viking , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imaging .",
    "this is being used to confirm or deny a detection as the viking @xmath0 band is @xmath16 magnitude deeper than sdss @xmath17 band when compared to an average sed for a low - redshift galaxy @xcite . in future",
    ", we plan to focus on finding similar objects in viking and , eventually , kilo - degree survey ( kids ; @xcite ) images which have deeper limits in surface brightness than sdss .",
    "initially this can be done using a standard method ( e.g.  source extractor ) , before using this information to create masks to then apply the methods described and tested in this paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : surveys ] , the different survey data are described ;  [ sec : imred ] deals with the development and implementation of the image processing code ;  [ sec : detal ] describes the algorithm used to search the images to find the lsbgs hidden within ; and  [ sec : results ] presents the results and catalogue .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in  [ sec : sum+con ] .",
    "the newly detected objects presented in this work were discovered using sdss @xmath18 imaging within the limits of the three gama equatorial regions , g09 , g12 , and g15 . for confirmation that these detections are galaxies , further visual confirmation was required .",
    "this was achieved through the use of deep viking @xmath0-band data .",
    "the technical details of these surveys are described below .",
    "the gama survey is a wide - field spectroscopic survey that was undertaken to study cosmology , galaxy structure and galaxy evolution at low redshift @xcite .",
    "redshifts of galaxies were obtained using the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo australian telescope @xcite .",
    "spectra have been obtained for 238000 objects in five survey regions ( g02 , g09 , g12 , g15 , and g23 , which are fields centred at ra 2h , 9h , 12h , 14.5h , and 23h ) , with a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 for the main survey over four of the fields .",
    "the total survey area is 286 square degrees .",
    "independent imaging has been compiled from several other surveys whose footprints fall on the gama regions , covering wavelengths from the far ultraviolet to the radio @xcite .",
    "this paper primarily uses data from the three equatorial regions g09 , g12 , and g15 , due to coverage of these areas by sdss and viking .",
    "the galaxy stellar masses used in this paper were calculated using the method outlined in @xcite updated to include viking @xmath0- and @xmath20-band data , in addition to sdss data , in the fitting procedure . for these , a cosmology with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 was assumed .",
    "note these stellar masses and redshifts from the gama survey are used to define comparison samples , none of the newly detected lsbgs described in this paper have spectroscopic redshifts .      the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) has observed over 10000 square degrees of sky .",
    "the imaging was done using thirty 2048@xmath242048 ccds and five filters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "almost all of its standard imaging data were released in data release 7 @xcite .",
    "this imaging was taken in ` drift scan ' mode .",
    "each part of the sky was exposed for about 55 seconds as the sky moves across the detector , which was read out at the same rate .",
    "this created long strips of images in the scan direction .",
    "these strips , one for each detector , were subsequently processed through the sdss photo  pipeline @xcite and divided into fields along the scan direction for convenience of use .",
    "the data used in this work are the corrected images in the dr7 database .",
    "all information stored in the images is presented in counts , which can be converted into the ab magnitude system by applying equations supplied by sdss .",
    "these images are supplemented by various masks for each filter .",
    "a code supplied by sdss is used to extract the type of mask desired by the user @xcite .",
    "the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista , @xcite ) is a 4.1-metre wide - field telescope .",
    "it is located on paranal observatory in chile .",
    "one of the surveys this telescope is carrying out is the viking survey .",
    "this survey covers @xmath29 deg@xmath30 in the near infrared @xmath0 , @xmath20 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 bands .",
    "the @xmath0 band , in particular , was used as a check for the detections due to its improved depth of imaging over the sdss bands .",
    "notably the vista @xmath0 band was taken in dark time , unlike typical @xmath28-band observations that are ` competing ' with visible bands .",
    "the reduced sdss images were processed in order to specifically search for lsbgs that had been missed by the sdss pipeline .",
    "the image processing can be separated into five distinct phases : ( i ) masking of image fields ; ( ii ) alignment of images ; ( iii ) weighting to maximise the expected snr ; ( iv ) coadding of @xmath26 , @xmath17 , and @xmath27 image fields ; and ( v ) smoothing of the final image products .",
    "these processes are described in the following paragraphs .",
    "sdss uses a drift scan mode to take images .",
    "this leads to long images spread across the sky with a width equivalent to that of the detector .",
    "for ease these images are split into ` fields ' of 1489 pixels by 2048 pixels , equivalent to @xmath34 .",
    "the 6424 fields that were used for target selection were selected from the gama equatorial regions .",
    "an example of the image files taken from the sdss is given in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : img_prog ] .",
    "the images were first masked to remove high - sb objects which have been discovered using sdss photo  @xcite .",
    "any pixel classed as being associated with a detected object was masked , including stars , galaxies , cosmic ray detections , and artefacts within the image fields .",
    "note this is a pixel - based mask rather than a mask based on polygons or ellipses around detected objects , as shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : img_prog ] .",
    "the data files taken from the sdss for each field are not aligned with each other because the detectors from the different bands are not perfectly aligned in the cross - scan direction .",
    "the scan direction is in ra , for the equatorial fields , and the cross - scan direction is in dec .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 images were aligned using a geometrical translation with the @xmath17-band coordinates as a reference , by up to 16 pixels difference ( @xmath35 ) in the @xmath26 band , and 5 pixels ( @xmath36 ) in the @xmath27 band .",
    "once the alignment is complete all images are aligned to within one pixel ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this remaining difference is not significant enough to be of concern because we are searching for significantly extended sources .",
    "lsbgs are diffuse such that the noise in any flux measurement is dominated by the sky background ( with standard deviation @xmath38 ) . in order to maximise the snr in any coadded image ,",
    "the images from each filter should therefore be weighted in proportion to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the expected signal level of a fiducial source .",
    "we are interested in optimising for low - mass , star - forming ( sf ) dwarf galaxies . to do this , we determined the median colours of gama dwarf galaxies with @xmath41 .",
    "these values are @xmath42 and @xmath43 with the colour distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gricolor ] .",
    "the expected signals were then determined for a fiducial source with @xmath44 , and using the equations provided by sdss for each field .",

    "the final step is to smooth the images in order to further improve the snr .",
    "sdss use a maximum @xmath50 binning kernel for detection purposes , i.e.  16 pixels are coadded to increase the snr . here , we convolve an approximately circular kernel of diameter 7 pixels ( @xmath51 ) with each image ( in practice , the kernel is a @xmath52 matrix of ones and zeros , for inside and outside the circle , respectively ) .",
    "this diameter is chosen as at the larger distances of interest , @xmath12 mpc , we expect objects of only a few arcseconds on the sky @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : img_prog ] shows the effect that coadding and smoothing has on the example image .",
    "now that the @xmath26 , @xmath17 , and @xmath27 bands for each field have been masked , weighted , coadded , and smoothed , using a larger kernel than was used by the photo  pipeline , there is increased sensitivity in the images for the discovery of field dwarf lsbgs than sdss photo  was able to achieve .",
    "the next step is to develop an algorithm which can be used to detect these hitherto undetected galaxies .",
    "for this analysis we adopt @xmath53 above the background of each processed image as the detection threshold .",
    "neighbouring pixels with a snr @xmath54 are grouped into ` candidate ' detections . for each candidate detection , we record the centroid position of the grouped pixels .",
    "this returned about one million candidate low - sb detections .",
    "these need to be processed to eliminate likely false detections , and to select potentially the brightest lsbgs in terms of total flux .",
    "most of candidate detections are from the excess light around bright stars and galaxies .",
    "this excess light is evident in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : img_prog ] for a typical field . in some fields there",
    "are also other artefacts .",
    "the list of sources therefore needs to be cleaned to remove these artefacts by applying a set of constraints to the detections list .",
    "these constraints are based on : ( i ) proximity to bright sources , ( ii ) anomalously high detection rates per field , and ( iii ) proximity to other candidate detections . the way these constraints",
    "are applied , and the reasons for applying them , is described in the following paragraphs .    in order to reject candidates that are caused by the unmasked light around bright sources , the percentages of masked pixels , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , within circles of radii 50 and 100 pixels around each candidate were determined ( radii of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ) .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nan_plot ] shows histograms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the candidate detections ; while the lower panel shows histograms for randomly - placed apertures , with 1000 apertures each for @xmath55 and @xmath56 per field .     and",
    "@xmath56 , within apertures of radii 50 and 100 pixels placed around candidates ( * top panel * ) and around random positions ( * bottom panel * ) .",
    "there is an obvious rise in the fraction of candidates that have a high percentage of masked pixels compared to randomly - placed apertures .",
    "this is caused by low - sb emission around bright sources .",
    "candidate detections falling within this second peak can be rejected with minimal impact on the effective search area.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we would expect field lsbgs in terms of their proximity to bright sources , which are mostly stars , to behave more like the randomly - placed apertures .",
    "we can see from the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nan_plot ] that there is an extension to large @xmath59 values that is not evident for the randomly - placed apertures .",
    "therefore we can reject candidates with large @xmath59 values while retaining the majority of genuine lsbgs .",
    "the criteria used for rejection were @xmath60% and @xmath61% . applying this criteria to the random apertures results in 16% of the random positions being rejected , therefore , this means that the effective search area is reduced to 84% of the survey area .",
    "[ fig : problems ] gives some examples of objects which were not removed by the masked - pixel checks carried out above , and which need to be dealt with as separate cases .",
    "the first of these are fields containing very extended wings of ultra - bright objects , making the detection of lsbgs difficult as it produces a large number of erroneous lsbg detections within the images which need to be excluded .",
    "therefore , the constraint decided on was to reject all fields with more than 100 candidate low - sb detections within it .",
    "this affects only 22 fields , which is a small enough number as to be easily visually checked , to ensure no obvious lsbgs were rejected .",
    "a further issue is the detection of stray light from bright stars that are in a field adjacent to the detection .",
    "an example of this is in the right - hand image of fig .",
    "[ fig : problems ] .",
    "this shows that parts of the artefact have been masked with the effect of breaking the object up into several smaller detections . in order to try to remove these objects and others like it",
    ", a constraint is applied to the images whereby all candidates that have more than 5 other candidates within a radius of @xmath62 are rejected . a random sample of these objects is visually inspected to ensure that predominantly artefacts are removed from the catalogue .",
    "one of the main reasons for conducting this study is to check the completeness of the gama survey , i.e. , detections with @xmath63mag , or near to this limit , are of most interest .",
    "to select potentially bright lsbgs ( in total flux ) , two apertures of diameter @xmath64 and @xmath65 are placed over the objects and the flux measured in both on the masked images .",
    "we select candidates whose flux was measured to be brighter than nominally 21.3mag in one of the apertures for the final stage of analysis , and all others are rejected .",
    "this reduces the number of candidates to about 5000 detections .",
    "this sample was visually inspected .",
    "the candidates were given an integer quality rank from 0 to 2 where : 0 means a false detection , a diffraction spike or other artefact ; 1 means a possible lsbg detection , e.g. , a small object in the smoothed images with no obvious extended structure ; and 2 means a definite lsbg detection , an obvious extended source that had not been masked by sdss .",
    "the number of possible and definite detections after this process was 652 .",
    "all of the removed objects are artefacts like those depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : problems ] .",
    "the list of positions was finally visually checked against the same positions in the viking @xmath0-band images , which were not used not used for detection .",
    "these viking images are deeper than sdss images for galaxies .",
    "this final check , along with eliminating duplicates of the same object , produced a sample of 343 lsbgs .",
    "[ fig : objects ] shows examples of images that were visually checked and proven to be real .",
    "all of the objects with rank 2 were confirmed by viking @xmath0-band data , along with many of the rank 1 sources .",
    "the distribution of large - scale structure has been consistently shown to fall into filamentary structures within a @xmath6cdm universe , in both simulation and through observation @xcite .",
    "it would be expected , therefore , that there would be some clustering of detections even for low - mass galaxies . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pos ] , the newly detected lsbgs are consistent with being associated with the @xmath66 large - scale structures . however , this is stated cautiously as without accurate redshift information for these objects , it is not possible to state with certainty that they are connected to these structures .          to select the potentially brightest lsbgs we used fixed apertures applied to the coadded - masked sdss images .",

    "this work attempts to answer a simple question : are there any lsbgs hidden within the gama equatorial regions that could contribute to the low - mass end of the gama gsmf ? using images from the sdss , and a specially developed algorithm to process the images and detect the objects it was discovered that whilst there are lsbgs , they do not meet the required magnitude cut of @xmath63mag .",

    "if they are low - mass galaxies , they could be significant for any attempt to measure further down the gsmf using a deeper sample such as from the wide area vista extragalactic survey ( waves ; @xcite ) .    the algorithm created consisted of several parts : the weighting and coadding of the images , masking , and smoothing to bring out any hidden objects within the images . a cut of @xmath53",
    "was then applied to the images to identify any pixels with a high enough snr to be considered a detection .",

    "it is clear that the systems discovered in this work are too faint to be included in any calculations of the gsmf using the gama main survey limit . however , the lsbg catalogue can be used in future studies as a test sample for deeper imaging in the same regions",
