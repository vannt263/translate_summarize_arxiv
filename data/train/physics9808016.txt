    "one of the common goals in the forthcoming experiments is the search for new phenomena . in the forthcoming high energy physics experiments ( lhc , tev22 , nlc , ... )",
    "the main goal is the search for physics beyond the standard model ( supersymmetry , @xmath8- , @xmath9-bosons , ... ) and the higgs boson discovery as a final confirmation of the standard model . in estimation of the discovery potential of the future experiments ( to be specific in this paper we shall use as an example cms experiment at lhc  @xcite ) the background cross section is calculated and for the given integrated luminosity @xmath10",
    "the average number of background events is @xmath11 .",
    "suppose the existence of a new physics leads to the nonzero signal cross section @xmath12 with the same signature as for the background cross section that results in the prediction of the additional average number of signal events @xmath13 for the integrated luminosity @xmath10 .",
    "the total average number of the events is @xmath14 .",
    "so , as a result of new physics existence , we expect an excess of the average number of events . in real experiments",
    "the probability of the realization of @xmath15 events is described by poisson distribution  @xcite    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the average number of events .",
    "remember that the poisson distribution @xmath18 gives  @xcite the probability of finding exactly @xmath15 events in the given interval of ( e.g. space and time ) when the events occur independently of one another and of @xmath19 at an average rate of @xmath17 per the given interval .",
    "for the poisson distribution the variance @xmath20 equals to @xmath17 .",
    "so , to estimate the probability of the new physics discovery we have to compare the poisson statistics with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . usually , high energy physicists use the following `` significances '' for testing the possibility to discover new physics in an experiment :    * `` significance '' @xmath23  @xcite , * `` significance '' @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "a conventional claim is that for @xmath25 we shall discover new physics ( here , of course , the systematical errors are ignored ) . for @xmath26",
    "the significances @xmath27 and @xmath28 coincide ( the search for higgs boson through the @xmath29 signature ) . for the case when @xmath30 ,  @xmath27 and @xmath28 differ .",
    "therefore , a natural question arises : what is the correct definition for the significance @xmath27 , @xmath28 or anything else ?",
    "it should be noted that there is a crucial difference between `` future '' experiment and the `` real '' experiment . in the `` real '' experiment",
    "the total number of events @xmath31 is a given number ( already has been measured ) and we compare it with @xmath0 when we test the validity of the standard physics .",
    "so , the number of possible signal events is determined as @xmath32 and it is compared with the average number of background events @xmath0 . the fluctuation of the background is @xmath33 , therefore , we come to the @xmath27 significance as the measure of the distinction from the standard physics . in the conditions of the `` future '' experiment when we want to search for new physics , we know only the average number of the background events and the average number of the signal events , so we have to compare the poisson distributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 to determine the probability to find new physics in the future experiment .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the probability to discover new physics in future experiments . we show that for @xmath36 the proper determination of the significance is @xmath37 .",
    "we also suggest a method which takes into account systematic errors related to nonexact knowledge of the signal and background cross sections .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we give a method for the determination of the probability to find new physics in the future experiment and calculate the probability to discover new physics for the given @xmath38 numbers of background and signal events under the assumption that there are no systematic errors . in section 3",
    "we estimate the influence of the systematics related to the nonexact knowledge of the signal and background cross sections on the probability to discover new physics in future experiments .",
    "section 4 contains the concluding remarks .",
    "suppose that for some future experiment we know the average number of the background and signal event @xmath39 .",
    "as it has been mentioned in the introduction , the probability of realization of @xmath15 events in an experiment is given by the poisson distribution    @xmath40    where @xmath21 for the case of the absence of new physics and @xmath22 for the case when new physics exists .",
    "so , to determine the probability to discover new physics in future experiment , we have to compare the poisson distributions with @xmath21 ( standard physics ) and @xmath22 ( new physics ) .",
    "consider , at first , the case when @xmath41 , @xmath42 . in this case",
    "the poisson distributions approach the gaussian distributions    @xmath43    with @xmath44 and @xmath45 or @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath15 is a real number .",
    "the gaussian distribution describes the probability density to realize @xmath15 events in the future experiment provided the average number of events @xmath17 is a given number . in fig.1",
    "we show two gaussian distributions @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath22 = 104 ( @xcite , table.13 , cut 6 ) .",
    "as is clear from fig.1 the common area for these two curves ( the first curve shows the `` standard physics '' events distribution and the second one gives the `` new physics '' events distribution ) is the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' . in other words , suppose we know for sure that new physics takes place and the probability density of the events realization is described by curve ii ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the probability @xmath50 that the `` standard physics '' ( curve i ( @xmath51 ) ) can imitate new physics ( i.e. the probability that we measure `` new physics '' but we think that it is described by the `` standard physics '' ) is described by common area of curve i and ii .",
    "numerically , we find that    @xmath52dx + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } \\sigma_1 } \\int_{\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}^{\\infty}exp[-\\frac{(x-\\sigma_1 ^ 2)^2}{2 \\sigma_1 ^ 2}]dx\\\\    & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } } [ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2}exp[-\\frac{y^2}{2}]dy + \\int_{\\sigma_2-\\sigma_1}^{\\infty}exp[-\\frac{y^2}{2}]dy ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & = & 1 - erf(\\frac{\\sigma_2-\\sigma_1}{\\sqrt{2}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "as follows from formula ( 4 ) the role of the significance @xmath55 plays    @xmath56",
    "note that in refs.@xcite the following criterion of the signal discovery has been used .",
    "the signal was assumed to be observable if @xmath57 upper confidence level for the background event rate is equal to @xmath57 lower confidence level for background plus signal @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding significance is similar to our significance @xmath59 .",
    "the difference is that in our approach the probability density @xmath50 that new physics is described by standard physics is equal to @xmath60 .",
    "it means that for @xmath61 the probability @xmath50 is correspondingly @xmath62 in accordance with a general picture . as it has been mentioned in the introduction two definitions of the significance",
    "are mainly used in the literature : @xmath23  @xcite and @xmath24  @xcite . the significance @xmath59 is expressed in terms of the significances @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath63 .    for @xmath26 ( the search for higgs boson through @xmath29 decay mode )",
    "we find that    @xmath64    it means that for @xmath65 ( according to a common convention the @xmath66 confidence level means a new physics discovery ) the real significance is @xmath67 , that corresponds to @xmath68 .",
    "for the case @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where for @xmath71 the value of @xmath72 is @xmath73 . for not too high values of @xmath0 and @xmath74",
    ", we have to compare the poisson distributions directly .",
    "again for the poisson distribution @xmath75 with the area of definition for nonnegative integers we can define @xmath76 for real @xmath19 as    @xmath77 , < n > ) , & x > 0 .    \\cr   \\displaystyle \\tilde p(x , < n > ) = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll }                 0 ,         & x \\le 0 , \\\\",
    "p([x ] , < n > ) ,         & x > 0 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    it is evident that    @xmath78    so , the generalization of the previous determination of @xmath50 in our case is straightforward , namely , @xmath50 is nothing but the common area of the curves described by @xmath79 ( curve i ) and @xmath80 ( curve ii ) ( see , fig.2 ) .",
    "one can find that    @xmath81    @xmath82 ,    @xmath83    @xmath84.$ ]    numerical results are presented in tables 1 - 6 .    as it follows from these tables for finite values of @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "the deviation from asymptotic formula ( 4 ) is essential .",
    "for instance , for @xmath85 , @xmath86   @xmath87 . for @xmath88   @xmath89 , whereas asymptotically for @xmath90 we find @xmath91 .",
    "similar situation takes place for @xmath30 .",
    "in the previous section we determined the statistical error @xmath50 ( the probability that `` new physics '' is described by `` standard physics '' ) . in this section",
    "we investigate the influence of the systematical errors related to a nonexact knowledge of the background and signal cross sections on the probability @xmath50 not to confuse a new physics with the old one .",
    "denote the born background and signal cross sections as @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "an account of one loop corrections leads to @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where typically @xmath96 and @xmath97 are o(0.5 ) .",
    "two loop corrections at present are not known .",
    "so , we can assume that the uncertainty related with nonexact knowledge of cross sections is around @xmath96 and @xmath97 correspondingly .",
    "in other words , we assume that the exact cross sections lie in the intervals @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the average number of background and signal events lie in the intervals    @xmath100    and    @xmath101    where @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "to determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old one , we again have to compare two poisson distributions with and without new physics but in distinction from section 2 we have to compare the poisson distributions in which the average numbers lie in some intervals .",
    "so , a priori the only thing we know is that the average numbers of background and signal events lie in the intervals ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , but we do not know the exact values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old , consider the worst case when we think that new physics is described by the minimal number of average events    @xmath104    due to the fact that we do not know the exact value of the background cross section , consider the worst case when the average number of background events is equal to @xmath105 .",
    "so , we have to compare the poisson distributions with @xmath106    @xmath107 and @xmath108 . using the result of the previous section",
    ", we find that for case @xmath109 the effective significance is    @xmath110    for the limiting case @xmath111 , we reproduce formula ( 5 ) . for not too high values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , we have to use the results of the previous section ( tables 1 - 6 ) .    as an example consider the case when @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( typical situation for sleptons search ) . in this case",
    "we find that + @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    @xmath120 + the difference between cms adopted significance @xmath121 ( that corresponds to the probability @xmath122 ) and the significance @xmath123 taking into account systematics related to nonexact knowledge of background cross section is factor 3.6 the direct comparison of the poisson distributions with @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( @xmath126 gives @xmath127 .",
    "another example is with @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath114 .",
    "for such example we have @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "so , we see that an account of the systematics related to nonexact knowledge of background cross sections is very essential and it decreases the lhc susy discovery potential .",
    "in this paper we determined the probability to discover the new physics in the future experiments when the average number of background @xmath0 and signal events @xmath1 is known .",
    "we have found that in this case for @xmath135 and @xmath136 the role of significance plays        for @xmath140 we have found that @xmath141 . for not too high values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , when the deviations from the gaussian distributions are essential ,",
    "our results are presented in tables 1 - 6 .",
    "we also proposed a method for taking into account systematical errors related to the nonexact knowledge of background and signal events .",
    "an account of such kind of systematics is very essential in the search for supersymmetry and leads to an essential decrease in the probability to discover the new physics in the future experiments .",
