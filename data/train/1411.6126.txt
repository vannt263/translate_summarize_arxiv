    "<S> the tongue retraction then starts , with a retraction force of roughly @xmath32 n  @xcite , the velocity increases while acceleration decreases and finally almost vanish ( r@xmath29 regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the tongue retraction is performed at essentially constant velocity ( r@xmath30 regime ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this typical sequence shows that , after the tongue whipped out the mouth at high acceleration , it moves essentially at roughly constant velocity except near the retraction point  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the tongue does not behaves like a stretched elastic material over its whole elongation but only in a small region around the capture point . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observation that the tongue is made of nested sheaths sliding along one another like the tubes of an extending telescope  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> stretching only occurs once this telescopic structure has been fully deployed . to describe the retraction phase </S>",
    "<S> , we thus model the tongue as a spring of stiffness @xmath33 stretched over a distance @xmath28 which is only a fraction of the prey - jaws distance ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the case of a constant retraction force ) .        </S>",
    "<S> the retraction phase is described by considering a prey of mass @xmath34 at a position @xmath35 attached by a viscous fluid of thickness @xmath36 to a tongue of mass @xmath37 and position @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> a force @xmath39 retracts the tongue and produces an increase of the mucus thickness ( @xmath40 ) inducing a viscous force @xmath41 acting on both the tongue and the prey , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figforce]a . </S>",
    "<S> this force is due to the poiseuille flow that is created in an incompressible viscous fluid when it deforms : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ( constant ) fluid volume  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion are  @xcite    [ model ] @xmath44    with the initial conditions @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 is the initial contact area between the prey and the tongue and @xmath24 is the initial mucus thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the heaviside function @xmath48 is added to describe an applied ( retraction ) force vanishing when the tongue has reached a retraction distance @xmath28 ( _ i.e. _ when @xmath49 ) . therefore , beyond that distance , only inertia is involved , @xmath36 stays constant and both the tongue and the prey move at constant speed . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the prey can only detach before the tongue reaches the position @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> this system is characterized by the length scale @xmath51 and the time scale @xmath52 which are used to adimensionalize the equations of motion as follows    [ eq - motion ] @xmath53    to illustrate the dynamics produced by this model , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figforce]b shows the evolutions of @xmath54 and @xmath55 as a function of the tongue position @xmath56 for some typical values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the magnitude of @xmath59 , two different behaviors are observed . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath60 , @xmath54 stays finite and there is no detachment . </S>",
    "<S> the adhesive force @xmath61 always vanishes precisely at @xmath62 where @xmath63 cancels and @xmath54 is therefore constant beyond that distance ( @xmath64 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the prey stays then attached to the tongue since both move at the same speed . </S>",
    "<S> however , when @xmath65 , @xmath54 diverges at some detachment distance @xmath66 leading to a sudden fall of the adhesive force . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it exists a critical value @xmath67 above which detachment occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we derived this relation analytically below .    except from a tiny region near the onset of retraction , fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in such a case ( unsuccessful capture ) , the adhesive force vanishes while the retractive force still applies to the tongue leading to a prey detachment at time @xmath73 , or equivalently at @xmath74 , given by @xmath75 after detachment , the prey moves at constant speed @xmath76 while the tongue still accelerates until it reaches the position @xmath77 , where @xmath63 vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath78 , the mucus thickness @xmath54 increases to saturate at a finite value @xmath79^{1/4}$ ] , see eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xt ] ) , ( [ h - app ] ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figforce]c . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the adhesive force acts on the prey until the retractive force vanishes when the tongue reaches the position @xmath77 at time @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> the necessary condition for a successful capture can be written as @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> considering the definition of @xmath81 , it imposes the following constraint on the prey mass : @xmath82 , assuming @xmath83 . returning to the physical variables , the maximum prey mass is therefore given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 kg / m@xmath6 is a typical prey density and @xmath86 the prey volume  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we also expect @xmath28 to scale linearly with @xmath90 , @xmath99  @xcite . using these parameter values , eq .  ( [ masse ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be written as a function of the chameleon body size as @xmath100 in mks units . in the literature , </S>",
    "<S> two studies report in vivo analysis of the stomachal contents of a large number of chameleons to determine the mean maximum prey size in relation to the chameleon svl  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ figmass ] shows a comparison between these data and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ prey - size ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum prey size estimated from the adhesion model is close but always larger than the experimental data and follows the global trend of the data . </S>",
    "<S> viscous adhesion alone is therefore largely sufficient to allow the capture of very large preys . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the adhesive mechanism appears to be outsized with respect to the usual preys found in stomachal contents ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmass ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this outstanding adhesion strength allows however chameleons to capture birds , lizards or mammals when they have the opportunity . </S>",
    "<S> viscous forces could also explain the reported capture of prey weighing @xmath101 of the chameleon body mass  @xcite . for a specimen with @xmath102 m , for example </S>",
    "<S> , the lower estimate of the maximum prey mass is about @xmath103 of the chameleon body mass . </S>",
    "<S> notice that during a capture , the maximum prey size could be lowered by a smaller contact area due to an imperfect shooting or by the gripping of the prey which are not taken into account here . </S>",

    "<S> it may appear paradoxical that @xmath106 increases when @xmath107 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the prey is attached to the tongue by a fragile viscous bound . </S>",
    "<S> if a large retraction force is applied to an heavy prey , the inertial force will be so large that the bound will break . instead </S>",
    "<S> , if a small retraction force is applied , the viscous bound may resist to gentle displacement of the prey , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ with a very small acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the fast kinematics essential to capture a prey at long distance without allowing it to dodge the tongue imposes that the retraction force can not be arbitrarily small which limits the maximum prey mass .    </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ masse ] ) shows that two parameters influence positively the adhesive trap : the fluid viscosity and the contact area . </S>",
    "<S> the specific shape of the tip of the chameleon tongue which is large and form a kind of cup during the capture due to the action of specific muscles  [ 4 ] allows a drastic increase of the tongue - prey contact area , @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a cup shape with highly deformable lips allows a large embedding of the prey within the tongue . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , _ plethodontidae _ ( salamanders ) use also a ballistic tongue to capture preys and have also developed a large and flexible tongue pad to engulf the prey and thus maximize the contact area  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experiments to measure the viscous adhesion strength against other possible adhesion mechanisms should therefore be conducted very carefully with a constant contact area . a large mucus viscosity , as measured above , is also essential . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if the viscosity of the chameleon tongue secretion was similar to human saliva ( @xmath108 pa  s ) , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ masse ] ) shows that maximum prey mass would be reduced by roughly a factor of @xmath109 making this mode of capture extremely inefficient .    </S>",
