    "the asymptote in eq .",
    "( [ e24 ] ) can not be a universal constant .",
    "it is not possible to imagine that a galaxy and a speck of dust dictate the same speed for distant passing objects .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 should depend on the mass of the gravitating body residing at the origin , because any localized matter will betray no characteristics other than its mass when sensed from far distances . to find the mass dependence of @xmath25 we resort to observations . from sanders and verheijn ( 1998 ) and sanders and mcgaugh ( 2002 ) , we have compiled a list of 31 spirals for which total masses , asymptotic orbital speeds , and velocity curves are reported .",
    "the figures in their papers contain the observed circular speeds and the newtonian ones derived from the observed mass of the stellar and hi components of the galaxies .",
    "we have selected those objects that a ) have a noticeable horizontal asymptote , b ) have fairly reduced newtonian speeds by the time the flat asymptote is approached , and c ) do not possess anomalously high hi content to hinder estimates of the total mass and the size of the galaxy .",
    "we also made the assumption that the total hi and stellar mass are distributed spherically symmetrically and mimic a point mass if observed from far distances .",
    "the relevant data along with @xmath64 are reported in the table , and the figure is a log - log plot of the calculated @xmath25 versus the mass .",
    "a power law fit to the data gives @xmath65 + it is important to note that eq .",
    "( [ e25 ] ) is not a consequence of the present theory , but rather an empirical relation dictated by observations and based on the masses and the asymptotic speeds of a selected list of galaxies reported by sanders et al .",
    "together with the popularly accepted rule that the masses and the luminosities of spirals are linearly related , it leads to a tully - fisher ( tf ) relation , @xmath66 .",
    "observational actualities , however , are complicated . in a recent paper ,",
    "kregel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) distinguish between different tf relations based on the luminosity , disk mass , maximum disk stellar mass , baryonic mass ( meaning stellar+hi mass ) , baryonic + bulge mass , etc .",
    "the reported exponents range from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , depending on the type of qualification ; see also gurovich et al .",
    "a more elaborate discussion of the issue falls beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the main sources of error in eq .",
    "( [ e25 ] ) , both in the exponent and in the slope , are a ) the estimates of the total masses of the galaxies , b ) the judgment whether what one measures as the asymptotic speed is indeed the orbital speed at the far outskirts of the galaxy , c ) the popular assumption that the masses and luminosities of the spirals are linearly related , and finally , d ) our heuristic assumption that the galaxies can be treated as spherically symmetric objects . in spite of all these uncertainties , we note that the exponent 0.494 is astonishingly close to 0.5 , the figure that one finds from mond .",
    "we also demonstrate in the following section that the slope @xmath69 is in very good agreement with the characteristic acceleration of mond .    .",
    "the data in the first four columns are from sanders et al .",
    "the last two columns show the empirical relation between the asymptotic speeds and the masses of the galaxies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     r : radius of the galaxy ( kpc ) ; m : stellar + hi mass ( @xmath70 ) ; @xmath71 : asymptotic speed ( km / sec ) ; @xmath72 : @xmath73 .",
    "we recall that in the weak - field approximation , the newtonian dynamics is derived from the einsteinian one by writing the metric coefficient @xmath74 and by expanding all relevant functions and equations up to the first order in @xmath75 . in a similar way one may find our modified newtonian dynamics from the presently modified gr by expanding @xmath76 of eq .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) up the first order in @xmath25 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78 where the second equality defines @xmath79 .",
    "let us write eq .",
    "( @xmath80 ) ( with slight tolerance ) as @xmath81 and find the gravitational acceleration + @xmath82 where we have denoted @xmath83 the limiting behaviors of @xmath84 are the same as those of mond .",
    "one may , therefore , comfortably identify @xmath85 as mond s characteristic acceleration and calculate @xmath72 anew from eq ( [ e28 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath86cm / sec@xmath87 , one finds @xmath88 it is gratifying how close this value of @xmath25 is to the one in eq .",
    "( @xmath80 ) and how similar the low and high acceleration limits of mond and the present formalism are , in spite of their totally different and independent starting points .",
    "it should also be noted that there is no counterpart to the interpolating function of mond here .",
    "we have developed an @xmath89 gravitation that is essentially a logarithmic modification of the einstein - hilbert action . in spherically - symmetric static situations , the theory allows a modified schwarzschild - desitter metric .",
    "this metric in the limit of weak fields gives a logarithmic correction to the newtonian potential . from the observed asymptotic speeds and masses of spirals we learn that the correction is proportional to almost the square root of the mass of the central body .",
    "flat rotation curves , the tully - fisher relation ( admittedly with some reservations ) , and a version of mond emerge as natural consequences of the theory .",
    "actions are ordinarily form invariant under the changes in sources .",
    "mass dependence of @xmath25 destroys this feature and any claim for the action - based theory should be qualified with such reservation in mind .",
    "this , however , should not be surprising , for it is understood that all alternative gravitations , one way or another , go beyond the classic gr .",
    "one should not be surprised if some of the commonly accepted notions require re - thinking and generalizations .",
    "since the appearance of an earlier version of this paper in arxiv , mendoza et al.(2006 ) have investigated the gravitational waves and lensing effects in the proposed spacetime .",
    "they find the following : a ) in any @xmath90 gravitation , gravitational waves travel with the speed of light in a vacuum , and b ) in the present spacetime , there is a lensing in addition to what one finds in the classical gr . their ratio of the additional deflection angle of a light ray , @xmath91 , to that in gr , @xmath92 ,",
    "can be reduced to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the impact parameter of the impinging light .",
    "the proportionality of @xmath91 to @xmath25 is expected , because the proposed metric is in the neighborhood of gr .",
    "its increase with increasing @xmath94 also should not be surprising , since the theory is designed to highlight unexpected features at far rather than nearby distances .    soussa et al .",
    "( 2004 ) maintain that  no purely metric - based , relativistic formulation of mond whose energy functional is stable can be consistent with the observed amount of gravitational lensing from galaxies \" . for at least two reasons , this no - go theorem does not apply to what we have highlighted above as the kinship with mond :    \\a ) apart from their common low and high acceleration regimes , the two theories are fundamentally different .",
    "the gravitational acceleration in the weak field limit of the present theory is the newtonian one to which a small @xmath95 correction is added .",
    "that of mond , on the other hand , is a highly nonlinear function of the newtonian acceleration through an arbitrary interpolating function .",
    "\\b ) more important , however , is one of the authors assumptions that  the gravitational force is carried by the metric , and its source is the usual stress tensor \" .",
    "this is not the case in the present theory .",
    "although we have only worked out the vacuum solution for a point source , the mass dependence of the exponent @xmath25 in eqs .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) makes the theory different from what the assumption requires .",
    "there are two practices for obtaining the field equations of @xmath3 gravity , the metric approach , where @xmath96 s are considered as dynamical variables , and that of palatini , where the metric and the affine connections are treated as such ( see magnano 1995 for a review ) .",
    "unless @xmath3 is linear in @xmath2 , the resulting field equations are not identical ( see ferraris et al .",
    "the metric approach is often avoided for leading to fourth - order differential equations .",
    "it is also believed to have instabilities in the weak field approximations ( see e. g. , sotiriou 2005 and also amarzguioui et al .",
    "in the present paper we do not initially specify @xmath3 . instead , at some intermediate stage in the analysis we adopt an ansatz for @xmath97 as a function of @xmath19 and work from there to obtain the metric , the ricci scalar , and eventually @xmath3 .",
    "this enables us to avoid the fourth - order equations .",
    "this trick should work in other contexts , such as cosmological ones .",
    "* stability of the metric of eqs .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) & ( [ e11 ] ) .",
    "the approach should be to impose a small perturbation @xmath98 on the metric , linearize the field eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , and ask for the condition of stability of the metric . such a condition ,",
    "if it exists at all , might throw some light on the mass dependence of @xmath99 , the empirical relation of eq .",
