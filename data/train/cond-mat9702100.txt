    "<S> one of the most powerful tools for this study is the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> excellent agreement has been obtained between the position of the lowest pole of the holon green function of the scba and the quasiparticle dispersion obtained by exact diagonalization of small systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important advance in the understanding of the scba has been the explicit construction of the corresponding wave function by reiter @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> a consistent picture of the observed spin and charge excitations has been obtained using a generalized one - band hubbard model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , very little attention has been devoted to the explanation of the intensity of the observed quasiparticle peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this task is difficult for the following reasons : i ) exact results for quasiparticle intensities in sufficiently large clusters ( containing more than 16 unit cells , as discussed below ) exist only for the `` bare '' @xmath0 model and only at a few wave vectors . </S>",
