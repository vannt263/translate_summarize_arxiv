    "in quantum information theory , the problem of characterization of correlations present in a quantum state has been intensively studied during the last two decades ( for review , see @xcite ) . the most significant progress has been made in this subject in the framework of paradigm based on the entanglement - separability dichotomy introduced by werner @xcite . within this paradigm ,",
    "the quantum correlations are identified with entanglement which is quantified by many entanglement measures .",
    "however , it has become clear gradually that quantum correlations can not be only limited to entanglement because separable quantum states can also have non - classical correlations @xcite , and therefore it has become clear that the entanglement - separability paradigm is too narrow and needs reconsideration .",
    "the first step in this direction was the introduction of the concept of quantum discord , the difference of two natural extensions of the classical mutual information , which can be used as a measure of non - classical correlations beyond quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "after the recent discovery @xcite that non - classical correlations other than entanglement can be responsible for the quantum computational efficiency of deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit @xcite , quantum discord became a subject of intensive study in different contexts , such as complete positivity of reduced quantum dynamics @xcite , broadcasting of quantum states @xcite , random quantum states @xcite , dynamics of quantum discord @xcite , operational interpretation of quantum discord @xcite , connection between quantum discord and entanglement irreversibility @xcite , relation between quantum discord and distillable entanglement @xcite , relation between quantum discord and distributed entanglement of formation @xcite , and monogamy of quantum discord @xcite .    for pure states ,",
    "quantum correlations characterized by quantum discord can be identified with quantum entanglement as measured by the entanglement of formation . however , for mixed states it was shown that quantum entanglement , as measured by the entanglement of formation , may be smaller or larger than quantum discord @xcite .    because evaluation of quantum discord involves the complicated optimization procedure , another measure of non - classical correlations beyond quantum entanglement was needed .",
    "recently , daki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the geometric quantum discord , which involves a simpler optimization procedure than quantum discord .",
    "the geometric quantum discord was studied in different contexts , such as the quantum computational efficiency of deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit @xcite , dynamics of the geometric quantum discord @xcite , relation between the geometric quantum discord and other measures of non - classical correlations @xcite .",
    "the geometric quantum discord could be used instead of quantum discord , if one showed that they give consistent results , taking into account that both quantum discords are observable measures of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "recently , yeo _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite discovered , quite unexpectedly , that quantum discords do not give consistent results , namely they showed that quantum discord and the geometric quantum discord do not necessarily imply the same ordering of two - qubit @xmath2-states which means that the following condition @xmath3 is not satisfied for arbitrary states @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the lack of the unique ordering of states with quantum entanglement measures @xcite goes beyond entanglement .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the problem of the states ordering with quantum discords considering a large family of two - qubit states , namely two - qubit bell - diagonal states .",
    "in particular , we identify wide classes of states for which quantum discords give consistent results .",
    "the quantum mutual information of a state @xmath4 , @xmath6 is a measure of the total correlations present in a state @xmath4 , where @xmath7 is the reduced state of the system @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "the quantum conditional entropy , @xmath10 , allows one to rewrite the quantum mutual information in the following form @xmath11 the fact that the quantum conditional entropy quantifies the ignorance about the system @xmath12 that remains if we make measurements on the system @xmath13 allows one to find an alternative expression for the quantum conditional entropy , and thereby for the quantum mutual information .",
    "if the von neumann projective measurement , described by a complete set of one - dimensional orthogonal projectors , @xmath14 , corresponding to outcomes @xmath15 , is performed , then the state of the system @xmath12 after the measurement is given by @xmath16/p_{i}^{a}$ ] , where @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the von neumann entropies @xmath18 , weighted by probabilities @xmath19 , lead to the quantum conditional entropy of the system @xmath12 given the complete measurement @xmath14 on the system @xmath13 @xmath20 and thereby the quantum mutual information , induced by the von neumann measurement performed on the system @xmath13 , is defined by @xmath21 the measurement independent quantum mutual information @xmath22 , interpreted as a measure of classical correlations @xcite , is defined by @xmath23    in general case , @xmath24 and @xmath22 may differ and the difference , interpreted as a measure of quantum correlations , is called quantum discord @xcite [ da ] @xmath25 despite the simplicity of this definition , the analytical expressions for quantum discord are known only for two - qubit bell - diagonal states @xcite , for seven - parameter two - qubit @xmath2-states @xcite , for two - mode gaussian states @xcite , and for a class of two - qubit states with parallel nonzero bloch vectors @xcite .",
    "since evaluation of quantum discord involves the complicated optimization procedure , another measure of non - classical correlations beyond quantum entanglement was needed .",
    "recently , daki _ et al . _",

    "schmidt norm .",
    "since the geometric quantum discord involves a simpler optimization procedure than quantum discord , the analytical expression for geometric quantum discord was obtained for arbitrary two - qubit states @xcite as well as for arbitrary bipartite states @xcite .",
