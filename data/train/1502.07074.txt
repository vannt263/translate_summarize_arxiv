    "stellar evolution predicts that black holes ( bhs ) form from massive stars with mass @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and that there are more than @xmath1 bhs in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , only bhs in x - ray binaries can be detected through accretion .",
    "currently there are 24 x - ray binary systems in which the bhs have been confirmed via dynamical observations @xcite .",
    "five of them possess o or b type companion stars and belong to high- and intermediate - mass x - ray binaries . in the remaining 19 binaries the companion stars are of relatively low mass ( @xmath2 ) , and these binaries are transient x - ray sources with episodic outbursts , which are likely to be caused by thermal and viscous instabilities in an accretion disc around the bh @xcite .",
    "the main properties of the bh ( candidate ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the orbital periods    while a few bhlmxbs ( e.g. , xte j1550@xmath3564 , gx339@xmath34 , gs2023 + 338 , grs1915 + 105 , gs 1354@xmath364 , groj1655@xmath340 , 4u1543@xmath347 ) have orbital periods @xmath4 longer than 1 day , others are compact binaries with @xmath5 day .",
    "maxi j1659@xmath3152 is the shortest period bh candidate binary known to date , with a period of @xmath6 hr @xcite .",
    "observations also show that xte j1118 + 480 and a0620@xmath300 are undergoing rapid orbital decay at a rate @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the companion stars    in the majority of the binaries , the donor companions are dwarf stars with spectral types ranging from a2v to m1v ; there are a few cases in which the donors are giants or subgiants ( e.g. , k1/5iii for grs1915@xmath9105 , k0-k3iv for v404 cyg , b9iii for xte j1819.3@xmath32525 , f3-g0v for gro j1655@xmath340 , and k2/4iv for xte j1550 - 564 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these properties suggest that most of them are low - mass stars ( less than @xmath10 ) .",
    "for those in which the lithium abundance was measured ( gs 2000@xmath925 , a0620@xmath300 , and nova mus 91 ) , observations show the excess above the solar value by a factor of about @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) the x - ray luminosities    a typical bhlmxb spends most of its time in quiescence , and occasionally exhibit outbursts during which its luminosities increase by several orders of magnitude . during outbursts",
    "the x - ray luminosities rise to @xmath12 ergs@xmath13 ; between outbursts , they remain in a  quiescent \" state , with typical x - ray luminosities below @xmath14 ergs@xmath13 , except v404 cyg , which has a much brighter quiescent luminosity , around a few times @xmath15 ergs@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "\\(4 ) the bh masses and spins    astrophysical bhs are characterized by mass and spin .",
    "dynamical mass determinations have been made in 17 bhlmxbs , with the bh mass ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "statistical studies on the mass distribution of neutron stars ( nss ) and bhs @xcite suggest the presence of a mass gap or dearth of compact objects in the interval @xmath18 ( see however , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "numerical simulations of supernova ( sn ) explosions typically generate a continuous distribution of bh masses that decays with mass @xcite .",
    "the paucity of bhs with masses less than @xmath19 is probably related to the physics of sn explosions that lead to the formation of bhs @xcite .",
    "the spins of nearly 20 bhs have been estimated ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , by means of x - ray continuum - fitting @xcite and modeling relativistic reflection @xcite . the measured spins for bhs in lmxbs range from @xmath20 ( for a0620@xmath300 , *",
    "* ) to @xmath21 ( for grs 1915 + 105 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , one needs to caution that both methods are model dependent to some extent , and the results obtained for the same sources do not always agree each other .",
    "all galactic bhlmxbs dynamically confirmed are found in the galactic field with no apparent nearby dense clusters , so dynamical interactions ( i.e. , tidal capture and exchange encounter ) are not likely to occur during their formation processes .",
    "the standard scenario for the lmxb formation @xcite starts with a detached primordial binary with an extreme mass ratio in a relatively wide orbit .",
    "since most of the bhlmxbs are compact binaries with orbital periods less than 1 day , there must exists a process that leads to significant orbital decay of the primordial binary .",
    "after the massive primary star evolves off the main sequence , its radius rapidly increases , initiating roche lobe overflow .",
    "the mass transfer proceeds on a dynamical timescale since the primary star is much more massive than the secondary .",
    "the secondary star spirals into the stellar envelope when the massive star engulfs it .",
    "this is the so - called common envelope ( ce ) phase @xcite .",
    "the binary orbit changes dramatically since the orbital energy is lost due to friction between the secondary star and the envelope of the primary , and part of the lost orbital energy is used to eject the envelope .",
    "depending on whether the energy dissipated is enough to expel the envelope , the ce evolution will result in either a merger of the secondary star and the core of the primary , or a close binary consisting of the secondary star orbiting around the naked core of the primary star ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews of ce evolution ) . in the latter case ,",
    "as the duration of the ce phase is very short ( probably less than a few hundred years ) , the secondary , which is still relatively unevolved , is assumed to remain intact .",
    "the core continues its evolution towards core collapse to form a bh .",
    "the binary orbit is altered due to mass loss during the core collapse and possibly an natal kick is imparted to the bh .",
    "if the binary survives all these stages , the secondary star will evolve and overflow its roche lobe , due to either nuclear expansion or orbital angular momentum loss caused by magnetic braking ( mb ) and/or gravitational radiation .",
    "mass transfer onto the bh leads to the formation of a lmxb . in the former case",
    "the binary will evolve with increasing orbital periods , while in the latter , a converging system is formed until the donor becomes degenerate . if the mass transfer proceeds at a sufficiently low rate , thermal and viscous instability may occur in the accretion disc around the bh , leading to transient behavior .",
    "based on the spatial distribution and recurrence times of known bhlmxbs , @xcite and @xcite estimated that there may be @xmath22 such systems in the galaxy .",
    "there are several unresolved issues in the standard scenario , which are outlined as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the secondary star , because of its low mass , may not have enough energy to eject the envelope of the bh progenitor during the ce phase , unless a significant fraction of the envelope has been previously lost through a very efficient stellar wind ; ( 2 ) the primary star may lose a large fraction of its mass during the sn explosion that produced the bh , and that may disrupt the binary . to show the former in some detail , we use the standard energy conservation equation @xcite to deal with the ce evolution , @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the primary and secondary masses respectively , @xmath27 the orbital separation of the binary , @xmath28 the mass of the primary s envelope that is ejected from the system during the ce evolution , @xmath29 the roche - lobe radius of the primary at the onset of overflow , and the indices i and f refer to the initial and final stages of the ce evolution respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 includes the effect of the mass distribution within the envelope , and the ( possible ) contribution from the internal energy @xcite , and @xmath31 is the ce efficiency with which the orbital energy is used to unbind the stellar envelope . as pointed out by @xcite , eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) lead to the lower limit for the parameter @xmath32 in order to avoid a merger of the primary s core and the secondary @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the maximum stellar radius of the bh progenitor .",
    "thus , for a secondary with @xmath35 , @xmath32 must be at least @xmath36 .",
    "however , calculations by @xcite show that stars of mass @xmath37 have @xmath38 for all @xmath39 , even when all the energy of recombination for the ionized species in the envelope that can be liberated to aid the ce ejection process is included .",
    "therefore , ejection of the massive envelope of a bh progenitor by a low - mass star proves rather difficult if not impossible .",
    "this fact has been noted by @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath40 , these authors showed that the parameter space of the semi - major axis of the primordial binary for the survival of the spiral - in process is extremely small , so that the predicted birth rates are about two orders of magnitude lower than derived from observations .",
    "@xcite also argued that abnormally high values of the efficiency parameter @xmath41 are required to gain any agreement with the observationally inferred bhlmxb birth rate ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for similar investigations ) .",
    "as seen from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , if the secondary stars are of intermediate mass ( i.e. @xmath42 ) , they would be more likely to eject the envelope .",
    "this mens that at lease part of lmxbs may evolve form intermediate - mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ) , when the donor mass becomes @xmath43 due to mass transfer . during the imxb phase ,",
    "since mass is transferred from the less massive secondary to the more massive bh ( usually of mass @xmath44 ) , the binary orbit increases accordingly .",
    "this can naturally explain the formation of the long - period systems like grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , but poses a problem for the short - period systems .",
    "obviously an efficient mechanism for orbital angular momentum loss is required for the formation of compact bhlmxbs .",
    "although intermediate - mass stars are not thought to be subject to mb , @xcite proposed that the secondary stars may be initially ap or bp stars , which are known to possess anomalously strong ( @xmath45 g ) magnetic fields @xcite . combining with the assumption that a substantial stellar wind may be driven from the donor star by the flux of x - ray radiation that is produced by accretion onto the bh",
    ", they showed that intermediate - mass donor stars with an anomalous magnetic field ( with @xmath46 g ) can be braked sufficiently to form short - period systems .",
    "chen & li ( 2006 ) proposed an alternative way of angular momentum loss from imxbs .",
    "they assumed that a small fraction ( @xmath47 ) of the transferred mass from the donor star during the rlof may not accrete onto the bh , but leave the binary and form a circumbinary disc .",
    "the tidal torques exerted by the disc can effectively drain orbital angular momentum from the binary @xcite .",
    "it was shown that with @xmath48 ( depending on the initial orbital periods ) , a circumbinary disc can cause secular orbital shrinking , leading to the formation of compact bhlmxbs ; for smaller @xmath47 , the orbits always expand during the evolution .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite have detected excess mid - infrared radiation from a 0620@xmath300 and xte j1118 + 480 with an emitting areas @xmath49 times larger than the binary orbital separations , providing possible evidence of the existence of a circumbinary disc around some bhlmxbs .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that synchrotron emission from a partially self - absorbed outflow might be responsible for the observed mid - ir excess , in place of , or in addition to , thermal emission from the circumbinary material .",
    "support of the imxb models comes from the cno - processed material seen at the surface of xte j1118 + 480 from the ultraviolet spectra @xcite .",
    "this means that the companion star must be partially nuclear - evolved and have lost its outer layers , exposing inner layers which have been mixed with the cno - processed material from the central nuclear - burning region .",
    "mass transfer must therefore have been initiated from a somewhat evolved donor of initial mass @xmath50 @xcite .    however , the effective temperatures of the model donor stars are significantly higher than for those of the observed donor stars in bhlmxbs @xcite .",
    "the problem results from the fact that , even though the initially intermediate - mass star loses much of its mass fairly rapidly , the star is still somewhat evolved chemically ( both in helium and in cno abundance ) by the time its mass has been reduced to @xmath51 .",
    "this keeps the donor stars hotter than observed .",
    "another important clue on the initial mass of the secondary can be derived from the spin of the bh .",
    "as the bh accretes mass and angular momentum , its spin parameter ( @xmath52 ) increases according to @xcite , @xmath53^{1/2 } \\right\\}\\ ] ] for @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are the initial and current masses of the bh , respectively .",
    "if the bh spin in lmxbs is acquired through accretion after its formation , one may estimate the accreted mass ( @xmath57 ) by the bhs and the possible initial mass range the secondary from the measured bh mass and spin . that can provide useful constraints on the properties of the progenitor binaries .",
    "this idea can be tested for any arbitrary bhlmxb by comparing the derived bh spin based on the orbital period and the spectral class of the donor star with the measured one .",
    "it may also help recover the  true \" birth mass distribution for bhs from the current one ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore it seems that , the survival of ce evolution seems to require that the secondary be initially of intermediate mass , while the apparent donor spectral classes imply that the secondary would be of low mass at the onset of the roche lobe overflow .",
    "a plausible solution to this puzzle is that the secondary may be initially an intermediate - mass star , but lose a significant part of its mass after the formation of the bh , probably due to the ejecta impact during an aspherical sn @xcite40 @xcite and xte j1118 + 480 @xcite suggest that these bhs are likely to form in a sn event . ] .",
    "the ablated secondary star could then become a low - mass star , and mb would shrink the binary orbit and drive mass transfer , producing a compact bhlmxb .",
    "@xcite found that the values of @xmath32 that are appropriate to stars in the mass range @xmath58 and the later phase of their evolution ( i.e. , in or beyond the hertzprung gap ) lie in the range of @xmath59 .",
    "these values were obtained under the following assumptions : ( 1 ) the definition of @xmath32 includes the gravitational binding energy , the thermal and the ionization energy within the envelope @xcite ; ( 2 ) the core mass in the primary star is defined as the central mass that contains @xmath60 of hydrogen , and ( 3 ) the primary star loses mass through stellar wind at a rate according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "since ce evolution plays a key role in the formation of these systems , in the following we will discuss each point in some detail .",
    "besides the thermal and ionization energy , other energy sources may also contribute to the envelope ejection .",
    "one of them is nuclear fusion @xcite .",
    "this can occur during the slow merger of a massive primary with a secondary of mass @xmath61 , when the primary has already completed helium core burning .",
    "@xcite suggested that , once the inspiraling secondary fills its own roche lobe during the ce phase , a stream of hydrogen - rich material from the secondary can penetrate deep into the primary s core , mixing hydrogen into the helium - burning shell , and leading to a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "the released nuclear energy ( @xmath62 a few times @xmath63 ergs ) during this explosive hydrogen burning could exceed the binding energy of the helium shell , and result in the explosive ejection of both the hydrogen and the helium layers , producing a close binary containing a co star and a low - mass companion . the subsequent evolution then leads to a compact bhlmxb .",
    "this scenario also suggests that the formation of bhs in this kind of systems could have been accompanied by long - duration gamma - ray bursts .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the usually adopted energy criterion for the ce phase is not sufficient for an envelope ejection .",
    "they argued that mass outflows are likely to occur during the slow spiral - in stage , and the condition for such outflows is to balance the orbital energy with the enthalpy of the envelope rather than merely the internal energy .",
    "this is to add a pressure / density ( @xmath64 ) term in the binding energy equation @xmath65{\\rm d}m,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the gravitational potential energy , and @xmath67 is the specific internal energy . since @xmath64 is non - negative , the condition to start outflows occurs before the envelope s total energy becomes positive .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is then larger than usually estimated by a factor of @xmath68 , which might help allow for a low - mass ( @xmath69 ) companion to survive from the ce phase , even if the primary star is initially as massive as @xmath70 .",
    "there are arguments both for and against this",
    " enthalpy \" formalism from theoretical points of view , as outlined by @xcite .",
    "different formalisms of @xmath32 may be distinguished by applying them to the formation of specific binaries and comparing the results with observations1 , one of the three observed bh x - ray binaries that are known to host a wolf - rayet star as the mass donor @xcite , @xcite obtained constraints on the physics of the ce event , and found that the  enthalpy \" formalism is the only one that can explain the existence of ic 10 x@xmath31 without the need of invoking unreasonably high ce efficiencies @xmath41 .",
    "unfortunately , the adopted @xmath71 bh mass is almost certainly incorrect , because it was derived from the radial velocity curve from the wind emission lines , under the unrealistic assumption that the wind is spherically symmetric ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion on this subject ) .",
    "obviously a proper estimate of the energy requirement for the ce ejection is critical for the formation of not only bhlmxbs but also all kinds of post - ce binaries .",
    "another important physical question in calculating @xmath72 is how to determine the boundary between the remaining  core \" and the ejected  envelope \" of the star .",
    "there are different definitions of the boundary in the literature , which are ( 1 ) related to the nuclear energy generation within the hydrogen burning shell , ( 2 ) based on the the hydrogen abundance , and ( 3 ) connected with thermodynamic quantities @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that , depending on the definition of the core - envelope boundary and the treatment of the role of internal thermodynamic energy , the binding energy parameter @xmath32 can vary by two orders of magnitude ( from 0.02 to 3.50 ) for the a @xmath73 star at the tip of red giant branch .",
    "this sensitivity results from the fact that the binding energy within the hydrogen burning shell greatly exceeds that of the outer convective envelope .",
    "@xcite suggested that every giant has a well - defined post - ce remnant after it has been thermally readjusted .",
    "the mass @xmath74 of the remnant is most likely given by the divergence point , which is best approximated by the point in the hydrogen burning shell that had maximal compression ( local sonic velocity ) prior to ce .",
    "if the remnant mass remains above or below @xmath74 , then the star expands to overflow its roche lobe or contracts during its thermal readjustment .",
    "thus @xmath74 could be regraded as the bifurcation point which defines where the spiral - in stops .",
    "if the orbit of the primordial binary is initially so wide that ce is initiated very late in the evolution of the primary star , the star may have lost most of its envelope in stellar winds , which means that there is not much orbital energy required for successful envelope ejection even with a low - mass companion star .",
    "@xcite therefore argued that ce evolution is not crucial in the formation of galactic bhlmxbs , and stars with mass @xmath51 are the most likely companions in bhlmxbs .",
    "it should be noted that this scenario may work for very massive primary stars , since the stellar wind prescriptions should not significantly affect the stellar structure and the compact object remnant masses for stars with initial mass @xmath75 .",
    "it also requires that the progenitor binaries should have very wide orbits , so the parameter space for the formation of bhlmxbs could be quite small .    in fig .",
    "1 we compare the values of @xmath32 with and without including the contribution of the @xmath64 term in the binding energy ( denoted as @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively ) as a function of the stellar radius ( wang & li 2015 , in preparation ) , adopting the core - envelope boundary suggested by @xcite .",
    "the left and right panels are for @xmath73 and @xmath78 stars , respectively .",
    "we also consider mass loss due to stellar winds as in @xcite ( which is actually same as in hurley et al .",
    "2000 ) , and denote the stellar mass during its evolution .",
    "it is seen that , in both cases , @xmath79 for a rather wide range of stellar radius ( except near the end of the evolution ) , while @xmath80 except for small radius .",
    "@xcite suggested that the progenitor of a bhlmxb is a triple star , in which a massive close binary is accompanied at a large distance by a low - mass star .",
    "after the evolution of the close binary into an ordinary x - ray binary , the compact object is engulfed by its expanding massive companion , and spirals in to settle at its center . the resulting thorne - ytkow object ( to , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gradually expands until it attains the size of the low - mass star s orbit . then a second spiral - in phase ensues , leading to the formation of a low - mass close binary .",
    "@xcite proposed that during the evolution of tos the central ns may be converted into a bh by intense accretion , and part of the envelope may collapse into a massive disc , which may become gravitationally unstable and lead to formation of low - mass stars or planets .",
    "further evolution would be similar as standard lmxbs .",
    "@xcite argued that some bhlmxbs could harbour pre - main sequence donors .",
    "for a binary with an extreme mass ratio , the primary star evolves rapidly to explode and create a bh , while its low - mass companion has not reached the zero - age main sequence at that time .",
    "as a pre - main sequence star usually possesses strong magnetic fields , during its contraction toward the main sequence , mb dissipates the orbital angular momentum , and drives mass transfer . because pre - main sequence stars are cooler than main sequence stars , the temperature issue in the imxb models would be avoided .",
    "the aforementioned models can also explain the enhanced lithium abundance measured in several bhlmxbs ( though in different ways ) , because either tos provide an ideal environment for the production of @xmath81li by the @xmath81be - transport mechanism , or pre - main sequence stars can have high ( up to primordial ) li abundance since no nuclear burning occurs in them .",
    "the predicted bhlmxbs should be young systems or subject to small kicks during the formation of bhs , and therefore have relatively low space velocities and a very small galactic scaleheight .",
    "however , none of the galactic bh transients are associated with or found nearby star - forming regions .",
    "it is also difficult for these models to explain the spatial distribution bh binaries like groj1655@xmath340 @xcite , xte j1118 + 480 @xcite and maxi j1659@xmath3152 @xcite , which are thought to have received rather large kick velocities ( @xmath82 kms@xmath13 ) at birth",
    ". they might be suitable for v404 cyg , which has a peculiar velocity of about 40 kms@xmath13 @xcite , implying that its bh did not receive a velocity kick larger than this value .",
    "bhlmxbs are exotic objects because they are very difficult to form ; they are also fascinating objects because they offer the best opportunity to study not only astrophysical phenomena associated with extreme gravity , but also binary evolution and sn mechanisms .",
    "we have briefly reviewed the progress made over the past decade in theoretical investigations on the formation of bhlmxbs , in particular short - period systems .",
    "understanding these binaries is difficult , since some fundamental issues have not been resolved , including    \\(1 ) what is the mass range of the bh progenitor stars ?",
    "\\(2 ) do the mass gap in bhs really exist ?",
    "if it does , what s the physics behind it ?",
    "\\(3 ) what is the distribution of the kick imparted on newborn bhs ?",
    "\\(4 ) how to properly estimate the total binding energy within the stellar envelope during ce evolution ?",
    "do we really need an initially intermediate - mass companion star for bhlmxbs ?",
    "\\(5 ) what s the dominant mechanism of orbital angular momentum loss in bhlmxbs ? how can it account for the rapid orbital decay found in xte j1118 + 480 and a0620@xmath300 ?",
    "in a recent work , @xcite suggested that stars of mass @xmath83 , which have not been observed as the progenitors of type iip sne , die in failed sne .",
    "such failed sne eject their hydrogen envelopes in a weak transient , leaving a bh with the mass of the star s helium core @xmath84 .",
    "this may explain the typical masses of observed bhs and the gap between ns and bh masses without any fine - tuning of stellar mass loss , or the sn mechanism .",
    "compared with more massive stars , these stars have relatively higher @xmath32 ( see fig .  1 ) , which may also help eject the envelope for a low - mass companion star .",
    "obviously thorough population synthesis calculations are required to investigate the evolutionary history of bhlmxbs by incorporating various factors aforementioned in a more self - consistent way .",
