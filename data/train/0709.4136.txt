    "over the past decade , x - ray imaging by the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories has provided fresh , compelling observational evidence for hot bubbles , highly energetic jets , and/or `` active '' central sources within planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "so far , nine of @xmath0 pne targeted by these two contemporary x - ray observatories have been detected as diffuse x - ray sources ( kastner et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , 2003 ; chu et al .  2001 ; guerrero et al .  2002 , 2005 ; sahai et al .  2003 ; montez et al .  2005 ; gruendl et al .",
    "2006 ) , while an additional handful have been revealed to harbor x - ray point sources at their cores ( e.g. , guerrero et al.2001 ; kastner et al .",
    "both `` flavors '' of x - ray source  diffuse and point - like  can be used to probe pn shaping processes and to constrain models of pn structural evolution .",
    "models of pn shaping have long predicted the formation of x - ray - emitting `` hot bubbles . ''",
    "a hot bubble may be produced within a pn as the central star makes the transition from post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) star to white dwarf , following an evolutionary track of increasing @xmath1 at constant @xmath2 , followed by decreasing @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in this phase",
    "the star produces very fast and energetic winds ( with speeds @xmath3 km s@xmath4 and mass loss rates @xmath5 @xmath6 yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "when such a fast wind collides with ambient ( previously ejected agb ) gas , it is shocked and superheated ( e.g. , zhekov & perinotto 1996 ) .",
    "the shocked fast wind forms an overpressured bubble that accelerates outwards and displaces the ambient ( visible , nebular ) gas as it grows ( kwok , purton , & fitzgerald 1978 ) .",
    "the supersonic growth of the bubble plows the displaced older material into a rim of dense gas which , when projected on the sky , is seen as a thin molecular , dust , and/or ionized structure that traces the bubble s perimeter .    3639 , mz 3 , ngc 6543 , 7027 , 40 ) or _ xmm - newton _ ( ngc 2392 , 3242 , 7009 , 7026 )  and one xmm nondetection ( ngc 2346 , with open bipolar lobes )  arranged according to optical morphology .",
    "( image montage courtesy bruce balick and martin guerrero . ) ]    in the majority of detections of diffuse x - ray emission from pne , the x - ray - emitting region is fully contained within bright optical rims or bubbles ( fig .  1 ) , as predicted by the preceding `` hot bubble '' scenario .",
    "furthermore , many of the detected objects harbor central stars that are of wolf - rayet ( wr ) type ( i.e. , `` [ wc ] '' or `` [ wo ] '' stars ) and/or display optical spectroscopic evidence for large mass - loss rates and wind velocities .",
    "these trends were already reasonably well established ( montez et al .  2005 ; gruendl et al .",
    "2006 ) when we stumbled upon yet another example of an x - ray - emitting `` hot bubble '' within a [ wc ] pn : ngc 5315 .      in a cycle 5 _ chandra _ study ,",
    "we observed two [ wc ] pns , ngc 40 and hen 2 - 99 ; we detected the former , but failed to detect the latter ( montez et al .",
    "2005 ) . in march 2007 , while searching the chandra archives for targeted observations of pns in support of a _",
    "chandra _ observing proposal , rudy montez discovered  to our great surprise and amusement  that a _ second _ [ wc ] pn , ngc  5315 , was present at the edge of the field of our 29 ks _",
    "advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) observation targeting hen 2 - 99 .",
    "rudy s examination of the chandra / acis image revealed an x - ray source at the position of ngc  5315 , @xmath7 off - axis .",
    "this serendipitous _ chandra _ detection of x - rays from ngc 5315 is all the more remarkable when one considers that there are only @xmath8 known [ wc ] pne in the sky ( gorny & stasinska 1995 ; tylenda 1996 ) .",
    "of course , it could also be said that this author pointed one of nasa s great observatories at the wrong object !",
    "indeed , due to the relatively poor _ chandra_/acis - s image quality at the far off - axis position of ngc  5315 , it is not possible to ascertain from the acis image alone whether the x - rays trace a hot bubble within this pn , emanate from the pn nucleus , or are emitted by both the nebula and its central star(s ) .",
    "fortunately , the background - subtracted spectrum ( fig .  [ fig : ngc5315spec ] ) , the luminosity , and the temporal behavior of the x - ray source associated with ngc  5315 appear quite definitive regarding the origin of the x - rays .",
    "the spectrum shows strong ne  ix line emission as well as a blend of o  vii and o  viii lines , with no evidence of fe l - shell lines .",
    "spectral modeling indicates that the emission arises in a @xmath9 k thermal plasma with enhanced ne and depleted fe .",
    "these results , and the inferred intrinsic source luminosity of @xmath10 erg s@xmath4 , are very similar to those obtained for the best - characterized diffuse x - ray pn , bd + 30@xmath113639 ( kastner et al .",
    "2000 , 2006a ) .",
    "meanwhile , the chandra / acis light curve shows no evidence for variability , and the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity of ngc  5315 is at least an order of magnitude larger than that of any unresolved pn core region detected thus far ( guerrero et al .",
    "2001 ; kastner et al .",
    "2003 ) , further supporting the interpretation that the x - rays arise from an extended region within ngc  5315 .",
    "these results , described in detail in kastner et al.(2007 ) , establish ngc  5315 as one of the most luminous `` hot bubble '' pn x - ray sources yet detected .      the detection of the [ wc ] pn ngc  5315 by _",
    "chandra _ underscores two significant trends that have emerged from the x - ray observations of pne obtained thus far by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ ( kastner et al .",
    "2007 ) :    1 .   objects with wr - type ( i.e. , [ wc ] , [ wo ] , or wr(h ) ) central stars  which display characteristically large wind velocities ( @xmath12 ) and mass - loss rates ( @xmath13 )  account for a disportionately large fraction of pne that are established sources of luminous , diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "specifically , five of the seven known `` hot bubble '' pn x - ray sources are associated with wr - type pne .",
    "2 .   in all cases",
    "in which diffuse x - ray emission is detected , the optical / ir structures that enclose the regions of diffuse x - rays are clearly defined , and these structures generally display thin , bright , uninterrupted edges ( or `` rims '' ) surrounding a cavity of lower surface brightness that is coincident with the extended x - ray emission ( see also gruendl et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "these results indicate that the combination of ( 1 ) large wind kinetic energies ( @xmath14 erg s@xmath4 ) and ( 2 ) a `` closed containment vessel '' is necessary to yield pn hot bubbles with plasma densities sufficient to produce detectable soft ( 0.3 - 2.0 kev ) x - ray luminosities @xmath15 erg s@xmath4 .    ) vs.  central star fast wind velocity .",

    "lower left : pn x - ray luminosity ( @xmath17 ) vs.  wind luminosity of the pn central star ( @xmath18 ) relative to @xmath18 of the central star of ngc 6543 ( @xmath18 for ngc 2392 [ triangle ] is an upper limit ) .",

    "[ fig : pnxraytrends ] displays scatter diagrams for various pn and central star parameters measured for the x - ray - detected objects .",
    "the top panels demonstrate that the characteristic temperature of the x - ray - emitting plasma is far lower than expected , based on simple shock models , in almost all pns in which diffuse x - ray emission has been detected thus far .",
    "indeed , there is only one `` hot bubble '' pn , ngc 2392 , for which the predicted temperature of the shocked wind gas is consistent with @xmath16 ; for all other such objects , the predicted post - shock temperatures are larger than observed by factors ranging from @xmath19 ( bd @xmath203639 ) to @xmath21 ( ngc 7026 ) .",
    "it also appears that @xmath16 is uncorrelated with present - day central star wind velocity , but is weakly anticorrelated with pn bubble radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pnxraytrends ] , upper panels ) , suggesting that pn age is more important than present - day wind kinetic energy in determining the temperature of the x - ray - emitting plasma within hot bubbles .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pnxraytrends ] indicate that x - ray luminosity is correlated with present - day central star wind luminosity @xmath22 , and is perhaps anticorrelated with bubble radius .",
    "the shallow slope of the @xmath17 vs.  @xmath18 correlation  wherein 4 orders of magnitude in @xmath18 results in only a factor @xmath23 range in @xmath17  may suggest either that the conversion of wind kinetic energy to plasma radiation becomes more efficient as the central star wind declines in strength , or that the luminosities ( and , perhaps , temperatures ) of the hot bubbles within these pne are established during early phases of the post - agb evolution of central stars with rapidly evolving winds ( akashi et al .  2007 ;",
    "see also schnberner et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "a review of x - rays from collimated outflows and jets in pne was presented by martin guerrero at apn iv ( these proceedings ) .",
    "here , i merely point out that detections of x - ray emission from the energetic shocks that are expected to result from the interaction of pn collimated outflows , jets , and/or bullets with slower - moving ( agb ) material remain few and far between ; only 2 or 3 such detections have been made to date ( hen 3 - 1475 , sahai et al .  2003 ;",
    "mz  3 , kastner et al .  2003 ; and ,",
    "perhaps , ngc 7027 , kastner et al .",
    "the dearth of x - ray detections of pn jets and jet - like structures is not particularly surprising , in light of the similarly small x - ray detection rate of highly collimated outflows from young stellar objects ( e.g. , grosso et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , some trends may be emerging .",
    "in particular , it seems that the characteristic temperatures of x - ray sources associated with pne jets ( @xmath246 mk ) are systematically higher than those of `` hot bubble '' pne .",
    "also , as would be expected , all three `` x - ray jet '' pne show evidence for dusty , molecule - rich ( h@xmath25-emitting ) central tori that are potential collimating agents for the outflows that produce the x - ray - emitting shocks , whereas only one `` hot bubble '' pn x - ray source ( bd+30@xmath113639 ) was detected in the h@xmath25 survey of kastner et al .",
    "we have been revisiting all _ chandra _ observations targeting pne , so as to place constraints on the x - ray luminosities of pne central star systems ( kastner & montez , in prep . ) .",
    "the superior ( @xmath26 ) spatial resolution of _ chandra _ ( compared with _ xmm - newton s _ @xmath27 resolution ) is required to distinguish such point - like x - ray emission from diffuse emission originating with the surrounding nebula . to ascertain the _ chandra _ point - source x - ray luminosities or luminosity upper limits , we determine the acis count rate within an aperture of radius @xmath28 placed at the nominal position of the pn central star ( this radius accounts for typical _ chandra _ pointing errors of @xmath29 ) . we then compare this acis count rate with that obtained for a suitably chosen background region ( typically , an annulus surrounding the source region ) .      applying this technique to _ chandra _ observations of pne whose central stars are not symbiotic in nature ( see below ) , we confirm the detection of x - ray point sources within four nebulae ( ngc 246 , ngc 4361 , ngc 6543 , and ngc 7293",
    "; see guerrero et al .",
    "2001 and ` http://www.iaa.es/xpn/ ` ) and obtain x - ray flux upper limits for 10 other nebulae ( including three sources of diffuse x - ray emission , i.e. , ngc 40 , bd+30 , and ngc 7027 ) .",
    "we hence obtain a preliminary ( and potentially highly biased ) point - source detection rate of @xmath30% within `` classical '' pne at typical sensitivities of @xmath31 erg s@xmath4 .    for purposes of understanding the potential implications of these preliminary results for models of magnetic and/or accretion activity associated wth pn cores",
    ", it may be helpful ( though potentially misleading ! ) to compare pn core x - ray emission levels with those of solar- and subsolar - mass , pre - main sequence ( t tauri ) stars .",
    "evidently the hard ( @xmath3228 kev ) x - ray emission from such stars is usually coronal in origin ( e.g. , preibisch et al . 2005 ) , although for some fraction of t tauri stars the hard x - rays  as well as some or all of the softer ( @xmath320.31.0 kev ) emission  likely arise as a consequence of magnetically - governed accretion activity ( e.g. , kastner et al .  2006b ; telleschi et al .",
    "2007 ) . comparing our _ chandra _ results for the x - ray luminosities and luminosity upper limits of point - like pne x - ray sources with the @xmath17 distributions of a nearly complete sample of pre - main sequence stars in orion ( feigelson et al .  2005 ) , one might speculate that the nondetected pn cores , as a group , are less magnetically active than @xmath33 @xmath6 t tauri stars ; while the magnetic activity levels of the four relatively x - ray - luminous pn cores ( for which @xmath34 erg s@xmath4 ) are comparable to 13 @xmath6 t tauri stars ( ignoring for the moment the likelihood that the x - ray - luminous cores harbor close binary stars ;  3.2 ) .      in stark contrast to `` classical '' pne , it seems that x - ray - luminous point sources are a common ( perhaps ubiquitous ) feature of symbiotic mira systems : all but one of the six such systems observed thus far by chandra  r aqr , ch cyg , mz 3 , hen 2 - 104 , and mira itself  display x - ray sources at the positions of their central stars . the only symbiotic mira nebula in which no central x - ray point source is detected , oh 231.8 + 4.2 , possesses a very highly obscured central region ( i.e. , a dusty torus ) .",
    "the luminosities of the symbiotic mira x - ray point sources range over @xmath35 orders of magnitude ( from @xmath36 to @xmath37 erg s@xmath4 ) ; this emission is typically harder than that of diffuse ( shock - induced ) pn x - ray emission ( e.g. , kastner et al .",
    "2003 ) and may be highly variable .    by analogy with low - mass x - ray binaries ,",
    "the presence of x - ray point sources within symbiotic miras is likely indicative of binary mass transfer processes .",
    "hence , further observations and analyses of these x - ray sources should provide unique diagnostics of accretion of agb wind material by white dwarf ( or , in some cases , main sequence ) secondaries .",
    "more generally , studies of compact x - ray sources within symbiotic miras should provide insight into the disks , jets , and disk - jet interactions that are the likely consequence of central binary systems within pne ( see also montez & kastner , these proceedings ) ."
