    "inverse formulations are solved on a daily basis in many disciplines such as image and signal processing , astrophysics , acoustics , quantum mechanics , geophysics and electromagnetic scattering .",
    "the inverse formulation , as an interdisciplinary field , involves people from different fields within natural science . to find out the contents of a given black box without opening it , would be a good analogy to describe the general inverse problem .",
    "experiments will be carried on to guess and realize the inner properties of the box .",
    "it is common to call the contents of the box `` the model '' and the result of the experiment `` the data '' .",
    "the experiment itself is called `` the forward modeling '' . as sufficient information",
    "can not be provided by an experiment , a process of regularization will be needed .",
    "the reason to this issue is that there can be more than one model ( different black boxes ) that would produce the same data . on the other hand , improperly posed numerical computations will occur in the calculation procedure .",
    "thus , a process of regularization constitutes a major step to solve the inverse problem .",
    "regularization is used at the moment when selection of the most reasonable model is on focus .",
    "computational methods and techniques ought to be as flexible as possible from case to case .",
    "a computational technique utilized for small problems may fail totally when it is used to large numerical domains within the inverse formulation .",
    "hence , new methodologies and algorithms would be created for new problems though existing methods are insufficient .",
    "this is the major character of the existing inverse formulation in problems with huge numerical domains .",
    "there are both old and new computational tools and techniques for solving linear and nonlinear inverse problems .",
    "linear algebra has been extensively used within linear and nonlinear inverse theory to estimate noise and efficient inverting of large and full matrices . as",
    "existing numerical algorithms may fail , new algorithms must be developed to carry out nonlinear inverse problems .",
    "+ electromagnetic inverse,- and direct scattering problems are , like other related areas , of equal interest .",
    "the electromagnetic scattering theory is about the effect an inhomogeneous medium has on an incident wave where the total electromagnetic field is consisted of the incident,- and the scattered field .",
    "the direct problem in such context is to determine the scattered field from the knowledge of the incident field and also from the governing wave equation deduced from the maxwell s equations .",
    "as the direct scattering problem has been thoroughly investigated , the inverse scattering problem has not yet a rigorous mathematical / numerical basis . because the nonlinearity nature of the inverse scattering problem , one will face improperly posed numerical computation .",
    "this means that , in particular applications , small perturbations in the measured data cause large errors in the reconstruction of the scatterer .",
    "some regularization methods must be used to remedy the ill - conditioning due to the resulting matrix equations . concerning the existence of a solution to the inverse electromagnetic scattering one has to think about finding approximate solutions after making the inverse problem stabilized .",
    "a number of methods is given to solve the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem in which the nonlinear and ill - posed nature of the problem are acknowledged .",
    "earlier attempts to stabilize the inverse problem was via reducing the problem into a linear integral equation of the first kind .",
    "however , general techniques were introduced to treat the inverse problems without applying any integral equation formulation of the problem .",
    "scattering theory has had a major roll in twentieth century mathematical physics . in computational electromagnetics ,",
    "the direct scattering problem is to determine a scattered field from knowledge of an incident field and the differential equation governing the wave equation .",
    "the incident field is emitted from a source , an antenna for instance , against an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "the total field is assumed to be the sum of the incident field and the scattered field .",
    "the governing differential equation in such cases is the coupled differential form of maxwell s equations , which will be converted to the wave equation . + in order to guarantee operability of advanced electronic devices and systems , electromagnetic measurements should be compared to results from computational methods .",
    "the experimental techniques are expensive and time consuming but are still widely used .",
    "hence , the advantage of obtaining data from tests can be weighted against the large amount of time and expense required to operate such tests .",
    "analytic solution of maxwell s equations offers many advantages over experimental methods but applicability of analytical electromagnetic modeling is often limited to simple geometries and boundary conditions . as the analytical solutions of maxwell s equations by the method of _ separation of variables _ and _ series expansions _ have a limited scope , they are not applicable in a general case and in a real - world application .",
    "availability of high performance computers during the last decades has been one of the reasons to use numerical techniques within computational modeling to solve maxwell s equations also for complicated geometries and boundaries .",
    "+ the main objective of this article is to investigate mathematical modeling and algorithms to solve the direct , and inverse electromagnetic scattering problem due to biological tissues for a model based illustration technique within the microwave range .",
    "such algorithms are used to make it possible for parallel processing of the heavy and large numerical calculation due to the inverse formulation of the problem .",
    "the parallelism of the calculations can then be performed on gpu : s , cpu : s , and fpga : s . by the aid of a deeper mathematical analysis and thereby faster numerical algorithms",
