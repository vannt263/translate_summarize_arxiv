    "frustration in magnetic systems can lead to unconventional magnetic ground states and peculiar low temperature behaviours @xcite .",
    "for example , in two - dimensional and three - dimensional highly frustrated systems , the conventional nel ground state may be destabilized if frustration is associated to a weak connectivity of the lattice .",
    "this is the case for example in the kagom and the pyrochlore @xcite lattices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in these lattices , in the presence of nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions , the ground state is a disordered spin liquid state characterized by the abscence of magnetic long range order .",
    "the classical heisenberg model on these two lattices has a macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state @xcite which prevents any nel - like ordering at @xmath0 . at small but finite temperature",
    ", there is a tendancy to coplanar order in the kagom lattice @xcite but no order of any kind is observed in the pyrochlore lattice @xcite . for the pyrochlore lattice , in the extreme quantum limit of spins @xmath1",
    ", there is clear evidence for the absence of long range spin - spin correlations ( and thus the abscence of nel - like ordering ) @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the disordered state ( resonating valence bond spin liquid , valence bond crystal ,  ) is still unclear @xcite .",
    "on the experimental side , the pyrochlore antiferromagnets either do not order at low temperature , or have a critical temperature much smaller than the curie - weiss temperature @xmath2 , which is a general trend for highly frustrated compounds @xcite .    the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the interplay of the frustration of the tetrahedral unit cell with the weak connectivity of the ( corner sharing ) tetrahedra provides peculiar magnetic properties to the pyrochlore antiferromagnet.,width=283 ]    the reason why a number of pyrochlore compounds order at low temperature is that the spin liquid state is very sensitive to any additional term in the hamiltonian such as on - site anisotropies @xcite , dipolar interactions @xcite , biquadratic interactions , next nearest neighbour interactions  indeed , nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions leave a high degeneracy of the ground state , or at least a high density of states at low energy .",
    "if the additional interactions are able to lift this degeneracy , they will be primarily responsible for the low temperature behaviour of the system .    in this article",
    ", we consider the effect of small dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions ( dmi ) in addition to nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the same study was done on the kagom lattice @xcite and ( as it will be clear from the next sections ) similar consequences of dmi were found , although the magnetic structure is different in the two cases . in this paper , spins are treated as classical variables whereas a recent work @xcite considers the extreme quantum limit of spins s=@xmath3 , using another method .",
    "unlike the present approach , quantum fluctuations are taken into account , but other approximations are made @xcite .",
    "both approaches give to some extent similar ( although not identical ) results , which makes the overall picture of dmi induced ordering more reliable since the two methods start from different limits and use different approximation schemes .    in section",
    "[ introdmi ] , the microscopic origin of dmi is presented and it is shown how to take them into account for pyrochlore systems , in accordance with the symmetry of the lattice .",
    "section [ magnstruc ] explicits the two magnetic structures obtained for the two possible dmi we have considered , and the possible link with experimental results is done .",
    "taking into account coulomb repulsion and pauli s principle , anderson @xcite has explicited a microscopic mecanism which leads to isotropic super - exchange interactions ( @xmath4 ) in insulators .",
    "the main idea is that the energy is lowered if the spins of the electrons on neighbouring sites are in oposit directions because they can then minimize their kinetic energy by delocalizing on the nearest atoms , which is forbidden by pauli principle if the spins are parallel .",
    "this fact is translated in an effective magnetic hamiltonian  : @xmath4 .",
    "taking into account a weak spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath5 ) and expanding in powers of @xmath6 , moriya @xcite showed that the effective magnetic hamiltonian between two spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 has the following expression  :    @xmath9    with @xmath10 whereas @xmath11 and @xmath12 which is a symmetrical tensor is @xmath13 .",
    "these are the leading orders in @xmath6 and the second term of ( [ 22h26 ] ) is the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction ( dmi ) . despite their higher order in @xmath6 , the third term and higher order terms",
    "should _ not always _ be neglected compared to the dmi for two reasons .",
    "first , taking all the orders into account can restore the rotationnal symmetry of the hamiltonian as was shown in @xcite .",
    "this requires however some particular symmetry properties of the lattices @xcite which do not hold for the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the second case where higher order terms should not be neglected is when the magnetic structure induced by the isotropic interaction ( j ) is essentially collinear ( ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ) since the cross products @xmath14 will then be of the order of @xmath15 , and the dmi term in ( [ 22h26 ] ) will be of order @xmath16 , the same order as the next term ( @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ 22h26 ] ) ) . however , collinear structures do not play any particular role in the pyrochlore lattice @xcite and we shall only consider the first two terms of ( [ 22h26 ] ) in this paper .",
    "moriya s microscopic derivation of the dmi is only valid for insulators but other possible microscopic mecanism relevant for other materials were explicited , for instance in systems with rkky interactions @xcite .    whatever the microscopic origin of the dmi is",
    ", there are always symmetry constraints on the possible * d * vectors which may appear in the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian must be invariant under the symmetry operations of the crystal and this will restrict the possible * d * vectors to those for which the expression ( [ 22h26 ] ) is invariant ( under these symmetry operations ) .",
    "this way of constraining the * d * vectors has been given the name of moriya s rules @xcite .",
    "we will make use of these rules to determine the possible dmi in the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "one of moriya s rules states that if the point between two magnetic sites is a center of inversion , then there can not exist a dmi .",
    "for that reason dmi are absent in crystals with a high symmetry , but this does not rule out dmi in the pyrochlore lattice which has no inversion center at the middle point between two sites . carrying on the symmetry analysis one can in fact determine completely the direction of the * d * vectors as follows .",
    "considering a single tetrahedron ( the pyrochlore lattice is an assembly of corner sharing tetrahedra ) , the plane which contains two sites and the middle point of the opposite bond in the tetrahedron is a mirror plane ( these planes are \\{110 } planes in the cubic cell of figure [ fig1 ] ) . applying moriya s rules",
    "then implies that the * d * vector can only be perpendicular to this plane , or equivalently parallel to the opposite bond as shown on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "there are so two possible dmi between two sites which correspond to the two directions for the * d * vector ( and keeping the same order for the cross - product @xmath17 )",
    ".    the symmetry analysis ( moriya s rules ) can not give more information about dmi .",
    "indeed , the _ sign _ of * d * along the direction previously determined depends on the microscopic details of the particular compound @xcite , such as the number of electrons on the magnetic sites , the occupied orbitals , the crystal field ... at present , there is no general scheme to determine * d * quantatively , except in simple models which are unrealistic for the compounds we consider later on . for this reason",
    ", we will consider the _ only two possible _ dmi as determined by symmetry",
    ".    one can equivalently describe the two possible dmi with a fixed * d * vector but changing the order of the cross product since  : @xmath18 .",
    "this is done without any loss of generality since changing simultaneously the direction of * d * and the order of the cross product leaves the whole interaction unchanged . in the following the signs of the * d * vectors are changed while keeping always the same order for the cross products @xmath17 .",
    "these two possibilities are refered to as `` direct '' and `` indirect '' dmi and are explicited in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "once one particular dmi between two spins is fully specified , all the other dmi in the lattice are also fixed by symmetry .",
    "for instance the dmi within one tetrahedron can be deduced one from another thanks to the four three - fold rotation axes .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the dmi in the rest of the lattice are obtained by applying appropriate symmetries of the lattice as follows .",
    "two neighbouring tetrahedra in the pyrochlore lattice are corner sharing and are transformed one into another by the inversion center located at the common site ( site @xmath19 on figure [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "all the spins point towards the center of the tetrahedron or all of them point in the opposite direction and these two structures are usually named `` all - in '' and `` all - out '' . in the pyrochlore structure ,",
    "the four directions of the spins correspond to the four [ 111 ] directions in the underlying cubic ( fcc ) lattice ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the time reversal degeneracy is still present in the pyrochlore structure , but this is only a global degeneracy : the whole structure is uniquely determined as soon as the structure of one tetrahedron is fixed to one of the``all - in '' or `` all - out '' states .",
    "the resulting structure is represented on figure [ fig6 ] , where the two structures `` all - in '' and `` all - out '' alternate from one tetrahedron to its neighbours .",
    "the magnetic structure obtained in the presence of direct dmi ( figure [ fig6 ] ) was observed experimentally in the pyrochlore compound fef@xmath30 @xcite . in this compound , the fe@xmath39 ions have a half filled electronic d shell and an isotropic charge distribution with zero orbital momentum ( l=0 ) .",
    "this is unfavorable to the appearance of single ion anisotropies , and in any case can not reasonably explain the observed phase transition at a temperature of 15  k. however , dmi are not the only possible origin for this structure , third neighbour interactions @xcite also lead to this ground state .",
    "it is hard to discriminate between the two scenarii given the experimental and theoretical available predictions .",
    "however , if dmi are indeed present , this should show up as an effective anisotropy which is not the case with heisenberg third neighbour interactions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the parent compound nh@xmath29fe@xmath40fe@xmath41f@xmath42 also orders at low temperature and has a magnetic structure similar to the one obtained with _",
    "indirect _ dmi .",
    "this is detailed in section [ indirect ] .",
    "the consequences of indirect dmi are a bit more subtle to study than the direct case due to the occurence of entropic effects ( or `` order by disorder '' @xcite ) .",
    "these are not essential to understand the ordering of the system which can be predicted qualitatively on a mean field level , but they are important to predict the exact magnetic structure obtained at low temperature .",
    "monte carlo simulations in the presence of indirect dmi indicate a phase transition to a long range magnetic order at low temperature ( see the specific heat on figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the low temperature magnetic structure is a coplanar structure described by a @xmath43 wave vector .",
    "the magnetic moments lie in either the ( xy ) , ( zx ) or ( yz ) plane , which represents a global degeneracy .",
    "the magnetic structure of one tetrahedron for the ( xy)-coplanar state is represented on figure [ fig7 ] . similar structures are easily deduced for the ( zx ) and ( yz)-coplanar structures .      at the very outset , there is no reason to solve the problem within mean - field approximation at @xmath0 since one expects monte carlo simulations to be much more reliable , especially in the treatment of thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , the merit of the following mean - field approach is not to reproduce ( among others ) the magnetic structures found in monte carlo simulations , but precisely to predict magnetic structures which are _ not _ obtained in the simulations .",
    "this underlines that the magnetic structures observed in the simulations are the result of an entropic selection by thermal fluctuations ( which are absent in the mean field treatment ) .",
    "the structures found in the monte carlo simulations are @xmath43 structures  : the magnetic elementary cell is identical to the crystallographic one ( one tetrahedron ) .",
    "this justifies the following mean field approximation which assumes a wave vector @xmath43 and will give the corresponding magnetic structures which minimize the energy .",
    "the following mean field approach thus neglects any thermal fluctuation ( t=0 ) and consists of minimizing the energy of one tetrahedron with respect to the spins coordinates ( the eight angles defining the directions or the 4 spins of one tetrahedron ) .",
    "doing so , one finds that there is a continuous degeneracy of states which minimize the energy of one tetrahedron .",
    "these states can be classified in two sets .",
    "the first one is made of the coplanar states obtained in the monte carlo simulations and have a continuous global degree of freedom which is a global rotation in the plane ( rotation around @xmath44 on figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the second set of lowest energy states contains non coplanar states which can be described starting from a coplanar structure .",
    "starting from the coplanar structure of figure [ fig7 ] , one can parametrize the non coplanar states as follows  :    @xmath45    where the spins are labeled as in figure [ fig2 ] and where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are _ not _ independant  :    @xmath48    as soon as ( [ eqn:11h36 ] ) is true , the corresponding state is one of the degenerate ground states .",

    "note that the degeneracy due to the free choice of one of the two angles ( @xmath47 or @xmath46 in equation ( [ eqn:11h36 ] ) ) corresponds to a global degree of freedom for the pyrochlore lattice , so that the macroscopic degeneracy of the pyrochlore antiferromagnet without dmi is lifted and thus a phase transition due to dmi is expected already on a mean field level .",
    "the conclusion of the mean field treatment is thus that the coplanar state represented on figure [ fig7 ] is a ground state as well as the equivalent coplanar states in the ( zx ) and ( yz ) planes , and these three states can be obtained one from another by distorting continuously the magnetic structure while staying at the minimum of the energy . however",
    ", the intermediate states are not coplanar .",
    "the structure ( in phase space ) of the lowest energy states is sketched on figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "as we shall see , the planar and non coplanar states are not equivalent as soon as temperature is not zero  : they all minimize the energy but the thermal fluctuations will favour the planar states .    ground state in the case of indirect dmi .",
    "the ground state for the whole pyrochlore lattice is a @xmath43 structure so that only one tetrahedron is represented .",
    "similar structures in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 planes are degenerate .",
    "other non - coplanar states have the same energy but do not participate in the low temperature properties ( order by disorder , see text).,width=321 ]    finally , the magnetic structure for the direct and indirect cases are very different .",
    "there is however no reason for them to be related on a frustrated ( non - bipartite ) lattice .",
    "for instance the magnetic strucutres for @xmath53 and @xmath54 are very different on the pyrochlore lattice , the ferromagnetic system being magnetically ordered , whereas the antiferromagnetic has a spin - liquid ground state .",
    "this discrepancy between the two approaches ( mean field and monte carlo ) is interpreted as an entropic effect  : the mean field approach neglects the thermal fluctuations and identifies the ground states with the minima of the energy .",
    "however , the fluctuations around the different minima are not equivalent . some of them are entropically favorable , and since at finite temperature the system minimizes its free energy , the system will preferably fluctuate around the minima where the entropy is the higher , thus introducing a difference between the degenerate ground states at @xmath0 .",
    "those states found in monte carlo simulations are a subset of the one found by energy minimization .",
    "however , this `` order by disorder '' is not responsible for the ordering of the system as it only selects coplanar states by removing a global degree of freedom ( associated with equation ( [ eqn:11h36 ] ) ) and fixes the relative orientation of the four nel sublattices , but does not remove a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom .",

    "this compound is nh@xmath29fe@xmath40fe@xmath41f@xmath42 and differs from fef@xmath30 by the presence of nh@xmath62 which implies both fe@xmath39 and fe@xmath63 magnetic ions with the same concentration .",

    "the observed magnetic structure is similar to the one of figure [ fig7 ] , except that the 90^o^ angle between the spins on the figure is @xmath6476^o^ in the compound @xcite .",
    "since the fe@xmath63 ion is no more isotropic , it is not surprising that the observed magnetic structure is a little bit different from the perfect dmi structure since one expects other sources of anisotropies ( like single ion anisotropies ) in such a system .",
    "this however suggests that dmi may also be present in nh@xmath29fe@xmath40fe@xmath41f@xmath42 but with a change of sign of the dmi compared to fef@xmath65 .",

    "the experimentally observed wave vector is however not @xmath43 .",
    "the discrepancy could be due to the structural distortion which occurs in this compound and which lowers the symmetry .",

    "magnetically at low temperature @xcite . on - site anisotropies should be small due to the isotropy of the spin-@xmath3 and can not give rise to a critical temperature of @xmath64 40  k. it seemed natural to try and explain the ordering by introducing different coupling constants depending on the direction of the bond , due to the distortion , as well as small interactions between some of the second nearest neighbour which should be present in this compound @xcite .",
    "however , the experimentally observed magnetic structures @xcite could not be reproduced , not even the correct wave vector .",
    "experimentally , the magnetic structure is not fully resolved and there are two possible candidates @xcite . introducing dmi in accordance with the crystallographic structure , together with the previously tried isotropic exchanges , we were able to reproduce one of the candidates for the magnetic structure .",
    "more details about this analysis were published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "all the work presented in this paper treats the magnetic moments as classical 3d vector spins of fixed length .",
    "this is usually only a good approximation for high spin quantum numbers but is believed to produce at least qualitatively good results for the systems under study here , and we now give some clues which support our approach .",
    "first it was shown in a similar study on the kagom lattice that quantum effects are quite small in the presence of dmi interactions @xcite .",
    "second , the pyrochlore lattice is three dimensional and so the quantum effects are expected to be even smaller than in the kagom lattice ( 2d ) .",
    "third , if the ordering of the paramelaconite ( cu@xmath29o@xmath30 ) is indeed due to dmi as is proposed , then it is an experimental fact that quantum fluctuations are not very important in such systems since the magnetic moment of the @xmath1 cu@xmath63 ion is still significant @xcite .",
    "finally , a related work @xcite considered the extreme quantum case of spins @xmath1 ( using other approximations ) and both approaches give similar ( although not exactly identical ) results .    the classical treatment presented here should thus be relevant at least qualitatively even for the extreme quantum case of spins @xmath1 .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations were shown to renormalize strongly the critical temperature in a 2d frustrated system of spins @xmath1@xcite , and the critical temperature should also be renormalized by quantum fluctuations in the case studied here , although this effect should be weaker because the system is 3d .",
    "in this paper , the highly frustrated pyrochlore antiferromagnet with additional dmi is studied .",
    "the relevance of such interactions for this system is shown and the geometry of the * d * vectors which define them is deduced from symmetry arguments . two kinds of dmi can exist in a pyrochlore lattice and the consequences of both on the magnetic properties are investigated .",
