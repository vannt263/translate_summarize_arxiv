    "in the semi classical approximation of quantum mechanics the quantum effects are small perturbation around classical physics and can be obtained via wkb approximation .",
    "wkb has the aim to obtain an asymptotic solution of schrodinger equation .",
    "it is an approximation , because one assums a slowly varing potential .",
    "if @xmath3 and the charactristic lenght of the system be denoted by @xmath4 , wkb approximation means @xmath5 and the wave function is expanded asymptotically in powers of @xmath6 .",
    "so in this approximation the quantum correction is expressed in terms positive powers of @xmath7 .",
    "assuming wkb conditions , two leading terms are sufficient to have the essential part of expansion .",
    "the role of higher order terms is investigated in @xcite .",
    "there are many arguments against this definition of semi classical limit .",
    "for example it is incompatible with the superposition principle of quantum mechanics and it is completely different from ehrenfest s theorem @xcite .",
    "moreover the precise definition of classical limit depends on one s approach to quantum theory .",
    "the best example is de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory of quantum mechanics @xcite . in this theory",
    "the quantum effects are introduced by adding a term , _ quantum potential _ , to the classical potential .",
    "it depends on the second derivative of the norm of the wave function .",
    "so the classical limit is defined according to the value of the quantum potential as compared with the classical potential .",
    "choosing a special form of the wave function for which the quantum potential is ignorable , represents a semi classical wave function .",
    "this is completely different from wkb conditions .",
    "the conditions of wkb approximation are not sufficient to guarantee that the quantum potential is small and varies slowly as compared to the classical potential@xcite . in de - broglie ",
    "bohm s viewpoint there are many different works on how one can approach to the classical limit @xcite .",
    "arguments on the basis of interaction potential and boundary conditions @xcite , introducing the classical limit as a scaling limit @xcite and the existence of significant quantum potential for a sharp wave function by ballentine @xcite are some of them .",
    "the important fact is that it is quiet possible to have a precise definition of the classical limit in de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory without any reference to a perturbation expansion .    in this paper , following de - broglie ",
    "bohm s description , we shall discuss three regimes for a gravitational model via a perturbative expansion .",
    "classical regime , which incorporates quantum effects as corrections to the classical hamilton  jacobi function , quantum regime which is the opposite of classical regime , and the transition region between quantum mechanical and classical behavior .",
    "for this , firstly , we present a perturbation expansion of de - broglie ",
    "bohm s equations in terms of positive powers of @xmath7 .",
    "as one expects the first order is pure classical .",
    "this motivates us to look for a perturbation expansion of de - broglie ",
    "bohm s equations which is suitable for quantum regime . those states which belong to the quantum regime",
    "necessarily have not a semi classical limit .",
    "recently some highly non  classical quantum states are investigated in ref @xcite .",
    "as the quantum regime stands for the opposite of classical regime , it is expected that the classical effects be a small perturbation of quantum physics in the quantum realm .",
    "now the question is which expansion in terms of @xmath7 is suitable in this limit ? in the next sections we shall see that the classical corrections must be introduced by negative powers of @xmath7 .",
    "we see that if one writes a decreasing expansion in terms of negative powers of @xmath7 the pure quantum effects appear at the first order .",
    "moreover in the higher orders of expansion some classical effects emerge as a perturbation to the pure quantum solution . a similar series of decreasing powers of @xmath7 introduced by bronzan@xcite as the opposite limit to the wkb approximation .",
    "this method firstly applied to the energy of weakly bound particle in one dimension and then it is generalized to a modified wkb approximation @xcite which is basically different from our method which emphasizes on an expansion in terms of negative powers of @xmath7 for quantum regime .    in both cases , the classical and quantum realm",
    ", the condition that the higher order corrections are smaller and smaller , leads to a validity domain for the scale factor of the universe .",
    "in order to justify the points mentioned in the previous section , here we shall consider the application of de - broglie ",
    "bohm quantum mechanics to the wdw quantum gravity . and to make the argument more simple we consider the case of a minisuperspace , frw universe .",
    "the wdw equation for such a system is : @xmath8 here we have chosen @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the curvature parameter and @xmath11 is the cosmological constant .",
    "the bohmian equations for such a system are given by.]@xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hamilton ",
    "jacobi function , @xmath14 is the classical potential and the quantum potential is defined as : @xmath15 in which @xmath16 gives the ensemble density of the system and thus satisfying the continuity equation as : @xmath17 this has the solution : @xmath18 the bohmian trajectories are given by the guidance relation : @xmath19 as it is stated in the previous section , in the viewpoint of de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory , the classical limit is determined by criteria of quantum potential and quantum force being much less than their classical counterparts and this does not necessarily means the limit @xmath20 . in order to clarify this",
    "we use the above minisuperspace model . choosing @xmath21",
    ", one can obtain an exact solution : @xmath22 let us investigate this wave function in the limit of large scale factor , and let s choose : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an infinitesimal real number . setting @xmath25",
    "we get the classical limit , because the phase would be the classical hamilton  jacobi function , using the asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions : @xmath26 for a small @xmath24 we have : @xmath27 which clearly has inverse powers of @xmath7 . but",
    "the quantum potential has the expansion : @xmath28 it is seen that the quantum potential is small as compared to the classical potential : @xmath29 and thus the classical limit is obtained but with negative powers of @xmath7 in the expansion of hamilton  jacobi function .    in the following sections",
    ", we use this fact , and expand the hamilton  jacobi function in terms of increasing and decreasing powers of @xmath7 and obtain the regime of validity of these expansions for the above minisuperspace .",
    "let us first examine the case of possible solutions with increasing powers of @xmath7 . using the relation ( [ z1 ] ) the bohmian equation for the hamilton",
    " jacobi function ( [ z2 ] ) for the flat case can be written as : @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "suppose that we have expanded x in terms of increasing powers of @xmath34 as : @xmath35 putting this expansion in the equation ( [ z3 ] ) , one shall get the following algebraic relations order by order .",
    "* * zeroth order * + in this order we have : @xmath36 with the solution : @xmath37 which is just the classical relation and corresponds to the leading term of wkb expansion . * * first order * + having the zeroth order solution , the first order solution is simple to derive .",
    "the equation ( [ z3 ] ) leads to : @xmath38 its solution is : @xmath39 + at any order , the relation is an algebraic relation in terms of previous orders , so the solution can be easily obtained at each order .    using the relation ( [ z1 ] ) one can obtain the expansion of @xmath40 as : @xmath41 and this would leads to the following expansion of quantum potential : @xmath42 the important problem is that the quantum potential is also an expansion in terms of increasing powers of @xmath34 , so the limit @xmath20 and @xmath43 are the same , and thus the classical limit is determined by going to the limit @xmath20 , for the region that the above expansion is correct .    in order to see the validity regime of the expansion in terms of increasing powers of @xmath34",
    "let us evaluate @xmath44 by inserting the value of the classical potential .",
    "the result is : @xmath45 @xmath46 and for the quantum potential we have : @xmath47 it can be simply seen that in the limit of large @xmath48 , the expansion is appropriate , because @xmath49 @xmath50 and in this limit @xmath51 , provided that @xmath52 with @xmath53 so one can use this expansion for large scale factors .    at this end",
    "it is useful to derive the bohmian trajectories , using the guidance relation : @xmath54 up to zeroth order , we have the classical solution : @xmath55 and up to the first order : @xmath56 the classical and quantum trajectories are plotted in figure ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "scale factor is scaled by @xmath57 and time is scaled by @xmath58 and a value of @xmath59 is chosen so that the difference between the classical and quantum trajectories can be seen easily . as it is explained above , the quantum trajectory converges to the classical one at large times .    in figure ( [ f2 ] ) ,",
    "we have plotted the quantum potential ( in fact @xmath60 ) as a function of the scale factor , up to the first order .",
    "as it is seen , the quantum potential is negligible compared to the classical one , therefore we are in the classical limit .",
    "in this section we shall study the possibility of having a solution with decreasing powers of @xmath7 .",
    "again one starts from equation ( [ z3 ] ) and expand @xmath44 in terms of decreasing powers of @xmath34 . in the domain of applicability of this expansion",
    "the classical limit is not necessarily present .",
    "therefore the expansion is as follows : @xmath61 just like the previous section we put this expansion in the equation ( [ z3 ] ) , and this time we shall get differential equation at each order .",
    "( in contrast to the increasing power case , where we had algebraic relations . )",
    "* * zeroth order * + the equation would be : @xmath62 with the exact solution : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are two constants of integration . note that there is no footstep of the classical potential here and this shows that this is just a pure quantum solution ( at this order ) .",
    "* * first order * + the equation ( [ z3 ] ) at this order leads to : @xmath66 the solution again can be obtained simply as : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69    for simplicity we choose the case @xmath21 and the initial conditions @xmath70 .",
    "also we put @xmath71 with @xmath72 a dimensionless constant . with these parameters",
    ", we have : @xmath73 and @xmath74 again the domain of validity of this expansion is given by @xmath75 leading to @xmath76 .",
    "one can obtain an expansion for the norm of the wave function and the quantum potential using relation ( [ z1 ] ) , as : @xmath77 and @xmath78 with the above values of functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 we have : @xmath81 the quantum trajectory is plotted in figure ( [ f3 ] ) , and as it can be seen the solution is completely different from the classical solution . in figure ( [ f4 ] )",
    "we have plotted the quantum potential ( @xmath82 ) for this regime .",
    "it must be noted that this regime ( @xmath76 ) which admits an expansion in terms of negative powers of @xmath7 can be devided into two intervals . in the first interval , @xmath83 ,",
    "the quantum potential is negligible compared to the classical one ( classical limit ) but in the second , @xmath84 , the quantum potential is not be negligible ( quantum limit ) . in order to find @xmath85",
    ", one should set @xmath86 leading to @xmath87 .",
    "we have shown that since the classical limit in de - broglie  bohm theory has the meaning that the quantum potential is much less than the classical potential and the quantum force is much less than the classical force , it is quite possible to have negative powers of @xmath7 in the hamilton ",
    "jacobi function , in the classical limit .",
    "it is interesting to have more careful look at previous curves . in figures",
    "( [ f5 ] ) and ( [ f6 ] ) a combination of both regimes is plotted .",
    "as it is clear from these graphs , there are regions in which quantum potential and force are less than classical ones , but we have an expansion in terms of negative powers of @xmath7 .",
    "so it is quiet possible that the criteria @xmath20 has nothing to do with the classical limit .",
    "the border of quantum regime is determined by setting the quantum and classical potentials comparable , which leads to @xmath88 .",
    "although we did anything in a minisuperspace , the result is quiet general .",
    "again , here we are interested in gravitational applications , so we start from the wdw equation which is : @xmath89 with the classical potential @xmath90 . denoting the couple of indices @xmath91 as a single index @xmath92 ,",
    "simplifies writing : @xmath93 the equivalent bohmian picture is given by : @xmath94 and @xmath95 where a @xmath96 subscript represents @xmath97 and the quantum potential is given by : @xmath98 one can again expand in terms of increasing or decreasing powers of @xmath7 .    * * increasing powers of @xmath7 * expanding as : @xmath99 @xmath100 we get order by order : * * * zeroth order : * in this order we have : @xmath101 @xmath102 which is just the classical solution . * * * first order : * in this order we have : @xmath103 @xmath104 which leads to first order quantum corrections and so on . * * decreasing powers of @xmath7 * expanding as : @xmath105 @xmath106 we get order by order : * * * zeroth order : * in this order we have : @xmath107 @xmath108 * * * first order : * in this order we have : @xmath109 @xmath110 and so on",
