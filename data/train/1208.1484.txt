    "high - quality - factor resonators are increasingly used in a wide variety of ultra - sensitive measurements of force@xcite , mass@xcite and motion@xcite . high quality factor means that the oscillator can respond with large changes in oscillation amplitude or phase , to very small changes in a perturbing force . the dominant measurement paradigm for exploiting this enhanced sensitivity is based on driving the resonator with one pure tone near its resonance , while monitoring the response to the perturbation as a change of amplitude or phase , or even a frequency shift when a feedback loop is used to lock the phase . in the field of afm",
    "this measurement paradigm has been used to create images of surfaces to atomic resolution@xcite with very little back - action on soft and delicate material surfaces . however , in spite of its name , the atomic force microscope does not actually measure the force between the tip and the surface while imaging in these modalities .",
    "the determination of tip - surface force requires that one monitors the change in response as one slowly changes the height of the resonator above the surface@xcite .",
    "such measurements have provided impressive three dimensional force - volume plots@xcite but they are fundamentally limited by extremely long acquisition times which necessitate enormous effort to reduce drift artifacts@xcite , making three dimensional force maps impractical for most applications .    in this article",
    "we demonstrate a new approach to dynamic interaction measurement based on actively modulating the amplitude of oscillation while measuring the amplitude - dependence of the resonators response . a variation of amplitude which is slow on the time scale of the oscillation period lends itself to an analysis of the perturbing force in terms of the amplitude dependence of two signals : one in - phase and one quadrature to the sinusoidal motion .",
    "the amplitude - dependence of these two force signals allows us to determine the tip - surface interaction directly as a function of the cantilever deflection _ at fixed probe height_. we show how these two quadrature force signals provide the foundation for model - free determination of the conservative force versus distance curve , as well as an energy loss versus amplitude curve .",
    "these two force signals represent essentially all the information that is possible to obtain about the nonlinear perturbing force , from analysis of oscillator motion in the limited frequency band near the high @xmath0 resonance . after deriving the theory of adfs",
    ", we test the concept both with numerical simulation and experimental study of heterogeneous polymer surfaces . the improved force resolution of adfs allows us to critically analyze a commonly accepted model of the tip - surface interaction and it enables an alternative approach for characterizing the mechanical properties of polymer surfaces .",
    "in air and in vacuum the continuum dynamics of a cantilever beam are usually reduced to a single mode harmonic oscillator described by a simple equation of motion@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the position of the tip in the lab frame , h corresponds to the static probe height above the surface and @xmath3 is the frequency of the first flexural cantilever resonance with quality factor @xmath0 , effective spring constant @xmath4 and effective mass @xmath5 .",
    "the two forces acting on the oscillator are the tip - surface force @xmath6 and the external sinusoidal drive force of strength @xmath7 .",
    "the tip - surface force @xmath6 is in general a complicated function depending on the instantaneous tip position @xmath8 , velocity @xmath9 and , for hysteretic forces , on the past tip trajectory @xmath10 .",
    "one typically decomposes the tip - surface interactions into an effective conservative part which only depends on the tip position @xmath2 and a more complicated effective dissipative part@xcite , @xmath11 when driving with a sinusoidal signal on resonance , @xmath12 , the tip motion @xmath8 is approximately sinusoidal@xcite , @xmath13 with amplitude @xmath14 , frequency @xmath15 and phase lag @xmath16 with respect to the drive force , even under the influence of the significant tip - surface interactions .",
    "this sinusoidal tip motion is a result of the large quality factor ( @xmath17 in air , @xmath18 in vacuum ) which guarantees that the energy in the cantilever oscillation is greater than the tip - surface interaction energy during one oscillation cycle .",
    "the observation that the tip follows a simple orbit in the @xmath2-@xmath19 phase plane leads to a more compact description of the tip - surface force .",
    "every point in the phase plane is part of only one sinusoidal orbit with a specific amplitude . together with the assumption that the tip - surface force does not depend on previous interaction cycles , every point in the phase plane",
    "can be mapped to a unique history of the tip motion which starts at the maximum distance from the sample surface during an oscillation cycle .",
    "thus , the dependence of the tip - surface force on the past tip trajectory can be incorporated into the dependence on the tip position @xmath2 and velocity @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the interaction is completely described as a two dimensional function in phase space .",
    "such a function is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : force - disk]a .",
    "the plotted model force is a van der waals - derjaguin - muller - toropov ( dmt ) force with an additional damping term that depends exponentially on the tip position @xmath2 .",
    "this force model is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hamaker constant , @xmath22 is the tip radius , @xmath23 is the inter - molecular distance , @xmath24 is the damping constant , @xmath25 is the damping decay length and @xmath26 is the effective stiffness of the tip - sample system .",
    "the assumed numerical values for these constants are shown in table 1 .",
    "tip motion with fixed amplitude is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tip - motion]a . the corresponding phase space trajectory in fig . [ fig : tip - motion]b covers only one simple orbit .",
    "thus , force measurement at only one amplitude does not reveal the full nature of the tip - surface interaction as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : force - disk]b - e where conventional force - distance curves for different oscillation amplitudes are plotted .",
    "it is not possible to extract the exponential dependence of the damping from only one measurement at fixed amplitude .",
    "several measurements with different amplitudes are required to cover a larger region in the phase plane and gain a deeper insight into the nature of the tip - surface force , especially regarding dissipative interactions which can have very different physical origin .",
    "the tip - surface force could be considered as a time - dependent force acting on the oscillator and the force could then be reconstructed from higher harmonics of the tip motion@xcite . however , equation ( [ eq : tip - motion ] ) implies that higher harmonics of the tip - motion are insignificant .",
    "indeed , their amplitudes are typically below the detection noise floor and special force transducers@xcite , high interaction forces@xcite or highly damped environments@xcite are required for their measurement .",
    "the high quality factor of the cantilevers resonance amplifies only the fourier components of the force near the resonance frequency @xmath15 , whereas higher harmonics are sharply attenuated .",
    "the force fourier component @xmath27 can be determined from knowledge of the calibrated cantilever linear response function @xmath28 , the drive force @xmath7 and the equation of motion in fourier space @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fourier transform of the tip motion @xmath8 . with equation ( [ eq : tip - motion ] ) the complex fourier component @xmath27",
    "can also be expressed as two real - valued fourier components that are in - phase and quadrature to the motion @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the oscillation period . @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath34 can be measured with high signal to noise ratio , providing a foundation for highly accurate force reconstruction . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are usually measured for different probe heights @xmath35 above the surface@xcite . however",
    ", their dependence on oscillation amplitude @xmath14 can also be used for force reconstruction .",
    "hence the name amplitude - dependence force spectroscopy ( adfs ) .",
    "the component @xmath33 is called the virial of the tip - motion and is only affected by conservative tip - surface interactions@xcite . since the conservative tip - surface force @xmath36 depends only on the tip position @xmath2 , we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : fi ] ) as ( see methods ) @xmath37 equation ( [ eq : fi - rewritten ] ) shows that @xmath38 is the abel integral transform of the conservative part of the tip - surface interaction@xcite .",
    "the abel transform has a unique inverse transform with which we determine the conservative tip - surface force as @xmath39 thus , equation ( [ eq : force - reconstruction ] ) enables force reconstruction at fixed static tip - sample separation @xmath35 , using only the oscillation amplitude dependence of @xmath38 .    for dissipative forces",
    "such a simple reconstruction is not possible since they also depend on the tip velocity @xmath19 .",
    "however , the force component @xmath40 can be interpreted as the amplitude - dependent energy loss per oscillation cycle ( see methods ) , @xmath41 the amplitude - dependence of the energy loss gives a signature of the dissipation mechanism and equation ( [ eq : energy - loss ] ) allows for the quantitative exploration of the dissipative interaction at fixed probe height @xmath35 , whereas previously a slow change of @xmath35 was required@xcite .      to rapidly acquire the data for adfs we use a multi - frequency lockin measurement scheme@xcite which combines the fast tip oscillation at the resonance frequency @xmath15 of the cantilever with a slowly varying amplitude",
    ". different amplitude modulated drive schemes have been considered before@xcite but they allowed only for a qualitative analysis of the tip - surface interaction .",
    "the beat - like tip motion resulting from the drive signal is periodic with the beat frequency @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tip - motion]c ) . the calibrated linear response function @xmath43 of the cantilever is used to convert the measured tip motion spectrum @xmath30 to the force signals @xmath33 and @xmath34 . due to the slow change of the oscillation amplitude , every oscillation cycle at the fast frequency @xmath15",
    "can be considered as an oscillation with fixed amplitude . over a full beat period a large region in phase space",
    "is covered ( fig .",
    "2d ) and the complete dependence of @xmath38 and @xmath40 on the oscillation amplitude is revealed .",
    "the measurement time for complete @xmath38 and @xmath40 is 2 ms in our experiments under ambient conditions .",
    "this high acquisition speed makes it possible to combine high resolution surface imaging with high accuracy force measurements in a single scan with normal scan rates . to minimize feedback artifacts while scanning we evaluate @xmath38 and @xmath40 only while the oscillation amplitude increases .    moreover , the high quality factor resonance guarantees a gradual change of the oscillation amplitude , so that we can determine the tip - surface interaction without deflection or amplitude jumps that are caused by instabilities which are inherent to quasi - static and other dynamic force spectroscopy methods@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have not observed any indication of irregular motion or subharmonic generation when we study the tip motion over several beat periods while slowly approaching a polystyrene surface .",
    "we begin with numerical simulations of the equation of motion ( [ eq : equation - of - motion ] ) with the tip - surface force defined by equation ( [ eq : model - force ] ) and the numerical values for the force constants given in table 1 .",
    "we consider a standard cantilever in air with resonance frequency of @xmath44 , quality factor of @xmath45 and stiffness of @xmath46 .",
    "we apply a drive force with frequency @xmath47 and sinusoidally modulate the drive strength at a frequency of @xmath48 . without any tip - surface interaction , this drive force yields a beat - like motion with a maximum amplitude of 25 nm . in the presence of the tip - surface force ,",
    "we let the system reach a steady state and then collect data during two cycles of the amplitude modulation at a distance of 17 nm above the surface .    from the simulated motion we extract",
    "@xmath38 and reconstruct the conservative tip - surface force @xmath36 using equation ( [ eq : force - reconstruction ] ) .",
    "the reconstructed curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] , and it is in excellent agreement with the actual force used in the simulations . at the sharp transition point from the attractive to the repulsive regime small deviations become visible in the order of 0.7 nn .      in material science often",
    "the local mechanical properties of heterogeneous polymer materials are of interest .",
    "one example of such a material is a blend of polystyrene ( ps ) and poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) with surface topography shown fig .",
    "[ fig : conservative - force]a .",
    "the different solubility of these immiscible polymers causes the formation of domains with different height . the higher structures in fig .",
    "[ fig : conservative - force]a are pmma - rich , while the lower background matrix is ps - rich@xcite .",
    "scanning this sample we collect data at 1024 points on each of 256 scan lines in 17 minutes . without any additional assumptions about the force or the motion , the conservative force curve is determined using equation ( [ eq : force - reconstruction ] ) . a typical conservative force curve at one image pixel is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conservative - force]b .",
    "the curve shows an attractive force close to the surface with a sharp onset of repulsive force when the tip makes mechanical contact with the surface .",
    "the ability to rapidly measure a conservative force curve with such high accuracy at every image point enables a more detailed study of the local nano - mechanical interaction . in the absence of adhesion the repulsive conservative force is generally described in terms of a power law of the form@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the local stiffness factor for a particular interaction geometry and @xmath51 is the position of the force minimum @xmath52 . to minimize the adhesion during the mechanical contact between the tip and the surface , we use a cantilever with small nominal radius below 10 nm .",
    "a fit of the force model to the reconstructed force at every image point reveals that the interaction exponent has a mean value of @xmath53 , on both the ps- and pmma - rich domains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : conservative - force]c and d ) .",
    "this observation suggests that the geometry of the contact is close to the ideal case of a cone indenting a flat surface , where an exponent of @xmath54 is expected@xcite .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the actual conic shape of the afm tip . in contrast",
    ", traditional quantitative afm methods assume the dmt model geometry of a perfect sphere indenting a flat surface where an exponent of @xmath55 is expected@xcite .",
    "the measured interaction exponent illustrates the difficulties of quantitative parameter extraction from afm measurements for which common approaches are based on various assumptions about surface adhesion , probe shape and interaction geometry .",
    "furthermore , one should note that the applicability of continuum mechanics models at the nanoscale is still an open question@xcite .",
    "fixing the exponent @xmath56 for the whole surface , we generate a map of the stiffness factor as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conservative - force]e .",
    "typically dynamic afm requires an order of magnitude difference in stiffness in order to show image contrast .",
    "the high force accuracy of our measurement allows for the resolution of a factor of three difference in stiffness as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conservative - force]f .",
    "the pmma - rich domains are stiffer than the ps - rich matrix , in agreement with previous measurements@xcite and in agreement with the expected bulk modulus@xcite .",
    "local stiffness is a property typically extracted from the conservative part of the surface force .",
    "however , dissipative interactions are also present , which was recognized early in the history of dynamic afm@xcite .",
    "these dissipative interactions are far more complex as they depend not only on tip position @xmath2 , but also on the velocity and the history of tip motion . to get a signature of the dissipation mechanism we use equation ( [ eq : energy - loss ] ) to reconstruct the energy loss per oscillation cycle as a function of the oscillation amplitude @xmath14 . to demonstrate this we scanned a heterogeneous blend of polystyrene and low density polyethylene ( ldpe ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dissipative - force]a shows the surface topography of the blend where ldpe aggregates to form droplet - like structures",
    ". figures [ fig : dissipative - force]b and [ fig : dissipative - force]c show typical conservative force and energy loss curves reconstructed with adfs on each of the two domains . for both domains the dissipated energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : dissipative - force]c increases significantly in the repulsive region of the conservative tip - surface force . for ldpe",
    "we see that both the dissipation and the size of the interaction region are much larger than for ps .",
    "moreover , on ldpe the conservative force stays in the net attractive regime .",
    "we can interpret these observations as resulting from greater positive and negative surface deformation as the tip approaches and retracts above lpde .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that the ldpe domains are not in the stiff glass phase since the glass transition temperature of ldpe is below room temperature@xcite .",
    "the presented remarkably fast and accurate force measurements were performed with standard cantilevers and under ambient conditions .",
    "however , one reason for the wide - spread use of afm is the ability to image with a huge variety of cantilevers in different environments such as liquids .",
    "we therefore consider the applicability of adfs in different operating regimes .",
    "the adfs data acquisition scheme is based on a slow modulation of the tip oscillation amplitude which can be achieved by driving with two pure tones close to the first flexural cantilever resonance .",
    "the spacing between the drive frequencies determines the measurement bandwidth @xmath57 and in turn the measurement time @xmath58 .",
    "higher measurement speed ( scanning speed ) therefore requires larger spacing between the drive frequencies .",
    "the tip - surface force generates new frequency components in the spectrum of the tip motion near resonance , with spacing @xmath57@xcite .",
    "these new components contain the information for the adfs reconstruction and usually the measurement of approximately 20 frequency components is required for an accurate adfs reconstruction , as we have verified with simulations .",
    "the measurement therefore requires a frequency band around resonance broad enough to collect these 20 frequency components with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) larger than 1 .",
    "we call this frequency band the resonant detection band",
    ".    the accuracy and speed of the adfs technique improves with increasing width of this resonant detection band . in this band the tip dynamics @xmath8",
    "are well represented by the single harmonic oscillator which in fourier space is described by the linear response function @xmath28 given by @xmath59 with the imaginary unit @xmath60 .",
    "the linear response function is fully characterized by the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath61 , @xmath0 which depend on the cantilever and the environment . for a given force the response spectrum @xmath62",
    "is given by equation ( [ eq : em - fourier ] ) and the detector noise level determines the width of the resonant detection band .    for the sake of discussion",
    "we take the detector noise level to be frequency - independent ( white noise ) with an amplitude of @xmath63 and a measurement bandwidth of 500 hz . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bw]a we show the resonant detection band for a sinusoidal force of strength 10 pn applied to a cantilever having resonance frequency 300 khz with different spring constants and quality factors .",
    "the red curve shows that a significant reduction of the quality factor does not decrease the width of the resonant detection band . on the other hand ,",
    "reducing the cantilever spring constant ( for fixed @xmath15 and @xmath0 ) does strongly increase the width of the resonant detection band . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bw]b the width of the resonant detection band is plotted as a function of spring constant and quality factor for fixed @xmath15 .",
    "we note that for @xmath0 larger than a low threshold value , the width the resonant detection band is independent of @xmath0 and increases inversely with the spring constant @xmath4 .",
    "thus , decreasing @xmath4 appears advantageous .",
    "however , the spring constant @xmath4 should not be too small since for cantilevers with small spring constant the dependence of the motion on the nonlinear tip - surface force in equation ( [ eq : equation - of - motion ] ) becomes stronger and the motion can become chaotic @xcite .",
    "smaller @xmath4 also results in the generation of higher harmonics@xcite and excitation of higher cantilever eigenmodes@xcite which distort the motion so that it is no longer nearly sinusoidal .",
    "another cantilever parameter that can be changed is the resonance frequency @xmath15 .",
    "recently , low mass cantilevers with resonance frequency up to 2 mhz have become commercially available . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bw]c and [ fig : bw]d the width of the resonant detection band increases linearly with the resonance frequency ( at fixed quality factor @xmath0 ) .",
    "one should note that these low mass cantilevers are shorter than conventional cantilevers which yields a bigger deflection angle for the same amplitude of tip motion , resulting in greater responsivity of the optical lever system .",
    "this increased responsivity lowers the detection noise floor , further increasing the resonant detection bandwidth .",
    "thus , the multifrequency data acquisition scheme used for adfs benefits strongly from this trend toward higher frequency cantilevers",
    ".    for operation in liquids often cantilevers with lower resonance frequencies and lower spring constants are used . a small spring constant compensates for the decrease of the resonant detection bandwidth due to the lower resonance frequency .",
    "however , both spring constant and the resonance frequency should not be too small in order to avoid distortion of the motion from higher harmonics@xcite and higher eigenmodes@xcite .",
    "maximum oscillation amplitudes below 10 nm and high setpoint values also help to reduce these higher frequency contributions , as has been demonstrated for torsional force sensors@xcite .",
    "finally , we do not want the resonant detection band to spread to too low frequencies where @xmath64-noise becomes dominant . to achieve these goals , resonance frequencies of @xmath65 and spring constants of @xmath66",
    "should be sufficient .",
    "our discussion thus far has focused on maximizing the resonant detection bandwidth for a given detector noise .",
    "however , the snr within this band will have a contribution from the thermal noise force connected with the damping of the cantilever motion in the surrounding medium .",
    "the thermal noise force is independent of frequency and its magnitude is given by the fluctuation dissipation theorem as @xmath67 when going from air to liquid for fixed spring constant @xmath4 , the thermal noise force will significantly increase due to the reduction in @xmath15 and @xmath0 .",
    "if the thermal noise dominates over the detector noise , it can be shown that the snr is independent of the spring constant @xmath4@xcite .",
    "we demonstrated accurate and high resolution measurements of the conservative force and the dissipated energy while scanning .",
    "a direct analysis of the measured tip motion allows us to gain insight detailed information about the nature of the tip - surface interaction and dissipation mechanisms without extensive modeling based on idealized assumptions about the geometry of the tip and the surface .",
    "such insight is often necessary to understand the contrast mechanism in afm images .",
    "adfs requires only a narrow detection band whose width is basically independent of the cantilever quality factor .",
    "therefore , adfs can also be used for investigating biological samples in highly damped liquid environments with present - day noise detection limits .",
    "however , the tip motion has to be approximately sinusoidal on the level of single oscillation cycles .",
    "furthermore , adfs is compatible with the current trend in afm toward smaller , higher frequency probes@xcite since the width of the detection band increases linearly with the cantilever resonance frequency . with future generations of high frequency force sensors",
    "we envision that adfs will enable high - resolution force - volume measurement at video rate .    the general idea of exploring amplitude - dependence",
    "can also be extended to other modes of afm like frequency - modulated afm , torsional shear force microscopy or frictional force microscopy . beyond afm",
    ", the adfs concept may inspire the development of new sensing schemes , as the basics concepts presented here are applicable to many types of measurements which exploit the enhanced sensitivity of a high - quality - factor resonator .",
    "for a single drive frequency the tip motion is approximately sinusoidal as given by equation ( [ eq : tip - motion ] ) and the corresponding tip velocity becomes @xmath68 as the tip oscillates it experiences the surface force which is described as a function of tip position @xmath2 and tip velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the force is usually decomposed into a conservative part and into a dissipative or non - conservative part as in equation ( [ eq : force - decomposition ] ) . the conservative force is considered to be a function of only the tip position @xmath2 while the dissipative part depends also on the tip velocity @xmath19 , such that the dissipative force is anti - symmetric with respect to the velocity @xmath69    if the tip - motion contains only one frequency , only two real - valued fourier components of the time - dependent force between tip and surface are measurable . with an appropriate shift of coordinates we set @xmath70 and",

    "<S> dynamic afm has been enormously successful in imaging surface topography , even to atomic resolution , but the force between the afm tip and the surface remains unknown during imaging . </S>",
    "<S> here , we present a new approach that combines high accuracy force measurements and high resolution scanning . the method , called amplitude - dependence force spectroscopy ( adfs ) is based on the amplitude - dependence of the cantilever s response near resonance and allows for separate determination of both conservative and dissipative tip - surface interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we use adfs to quantitatively study and map the nano - mechanical interaction between the afm tip and heterogeneous polymer surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> adfs is compatible with commercial atomic force microscopes and we anticipate its wide - spread use in taking afm toward quantitative microscopy . </S>"
