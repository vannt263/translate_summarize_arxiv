    "let @xmath8 be a smooth , nonorientable , compact surface of genus @xmath9 with @xmath10 boundary components and @xmath11 punctures . if @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 is zero then we omit it from the notation . if we do not want to emphasise the numbers @xmath12 , we simply write @xmath7 for a surface @xmath8 . recall that @xmath13 is a connected sum of @xmath9 projective planes and @xmath8 is obtained from @xmath14 by removing @xmath10 open disks and specifying a set @xmath15 of @xmath11 distinguished points in the interior of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the group of all diffeomorphisms @xmath17 such that @xmath18 is the identity on each boundary component and @xmath19 .",
    "by @xmath20 we denote the quotient group of @xmath16 by the subgroup consisting of the maps isotopic to the identity , where we assume that the isotopies fix @xmath15 and are the identity on each boundary component .",
    "@xmath20 is called the _ mapping class group _ of @xmath7 .",
    "the mapping class group of an orientable surface is defined analogously , but we consider only orientation preserving maps .",
    "usually we will use the same letter for a map and its isotopy class .",
    "in contrast to mapping class groups of orientable surfaces , the nonorientable case has not been studied much .",
    "the first significant result is due to lickorish @xcite , who proved that the mapping class group of a closed nonorientable surface is generated by dehn twists and a so  called crosscap slide ( or a y  homeomorphism ) .",
    "later this generating set was simplified by chillingworth @xcite , and extended to the case of punctured surfaces by korkmaz @xcite .",
    "korkmaz also computed the first homology group of the mapping class groups of punctured nonorientable surfaces @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the group @xmath21 is generated by involutions @xcite .    at first glance",
    "it seems that it should be possible to derive some properties of @xmath20 from the properties of the mapping class group of its orientable double cover .",
    "surprisingly , although it is known that @xmath20 is isomorphic to the centraliser of some involution in the mapping class group of the double cover of @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) , this idea has not led to any significant results .",
    "one of the most fundamental properties of the mapping class group is that it acts on the set @xmath22 of isotopy classes of circles . in the case of an orientable surface",
    "this observation leads to the most powerful tools in the study of mapping class groups .",
    "for example the set @xmath22 has simple structures of a simplicial complex , which lead to definitions of complexes of curves .",
    "this idea was the basic tool in finding a presentation of the mapping class group and also in obtaining some descriptions of its ( co)homology groups ( cf @xcite and references there ) .",
    "another example is the extension of the action of the mapping class group on @xmath22 to the action on equivalence classes of measured foliations .",
    "this idea leads to the thurston theory of surface diffeomorphisms ( cf @xcite ) .    in either of these examples",
    ", it is of fundamental importance to understand the action of generators of @xmath20 on a single circle . throughout this paper , we concentrate on a very basic result in this direction , namely on the well  known formula for the intersection number @xmath23 which holds for any two circles @xmath1 and @xmath2 on an orientable surface and any integer @xmath3 ( cf proposition 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "our first result provides a formula for the action of a twist on a nonorientable surface , similar to ( cf theorem [ tw : index ] ) . to be more precise",
    ", we show that for generic two  sided circles @xmath1 and @xmath2 on @xmath7 such that @xmath24 , and any integer @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 are nonnegative integers depending only on the mutual position of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    as an application of this result",
    ", we prove in section [ sec : twist ] some algebraic properties of twists on nonorientable surfaces .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : centr ] we show that up to a finite number of exceptions , the centraliser of the subgroup generated by the twists is equal to the center of @xmath28 and is generated by @xmath10 boundary twists ( cf theorem [ tw : center ] ) .",
    "we end the paper with an appendix , which contains the description of two rather exceptional mapping class groups , namely those of a  klein bottle with one puncture and of a klein bottle with one boundary component .",
    "all the results presented are well known in the orientable case ( cf @xcite ) , but for nonorientable surfaces they are new .",
    "moreover , we believe that the methods we develop will contribute to a further study of mapping class groups of nonorientable surfaces .",
    "since the strategy we follow is similar to that in @xcite , in some cases we omit detailed proofs referring the reader to the above article .",
    "by a _ circle _ on @xmath7 we mean an oriented simple closed curve on @xmath29 , which is disjoint from the boundary of @xmath7 .",
    "usually we identify a circle with its image . if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are isotopic , we write @xmath32 . if two circles @xmath1 and @xmath2 intersect , we always assume that they intersect transversely . according to whether a regular neighbourhood of a circle is an annulus or a mbius strip",
    ", we call the circle _ two  sided _ or _",
    "one  sided _ respectively .",
    "we say that a circle is _ essential _ if it does not bound a disk disjoint form @xmath15 , and _ generic _ if it bounds neither a disk with fewer than two punctures nor a mbius strip  disjoint from @xmath15 .",
    "notice that the nonorientable surface @xmath8 admits a generic two  sided circle if and only if @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "following @xcite we will say that circles @xmath1 and @xmath2 _ cobound a bigon _ if there exists a disk whose boundary is the union of an arc of @xmath1 and an  arc of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we assume that except the end points , these arcs are disjoint from @xmath36 .",
    "for every two circles @xmath1 and @xmath2 we define their _ geometric intersection number _ as follows : @xmath37 in particular , if @xmath1 is a two  sided circle and @xmath38 then @xmath39 .",
    "the following proposition ( cf proposition 3.2 of @xcite ) provides a very useful tool for checking if two circles are in a minimal position ( with respect to @xmath40 ) .",
    "[ prop : bigon ] let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be essential circles on @xmath7",
    ". then @xmath41 if and only if @xmath1 and @xmath2 do not cobound a bigon .",
    "let @xmath1 be a two  sided circle . by definition ,",
    "a regular neighbourhood of @xmath1 is an annulus @xmath42 , so if we fix one of two possible orientations of @xmath42 , we can define the _ dehn twist _ @xmath0 about @xmath1 in the usual way .",
    "we emphasise that since we are dealing with nonorientable surfaces , there is no canonical way to choose the orientation of @xmath42 .",
    "therefore by a twist about @xmath1 we always mean one of two possible twists about @xmath1 ( the second one is then its inverse ) . by a _",
    "boundary twist _ we mean a twist about a circle isotopic to a boundary component .",
    "if @xmath1 is not generic then the dehn twist @xmath0 is trivial .",
    "we will show that the converse is also true ( cf corollary [ prop : tw : inf ] ) .",
    "other important examples of diffeomorphisms of a nonorientable surface are the _ crosscap slide _ and the _ puncture slide_. they are defined as a slide of a crosscap and of a puncture , respectively , along a one  sided circle ( for precise definitions and properties see @xcite ) .",
    "for the rest of this section let us fix two  sided generic circles @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that @xmath41 .      by a _ segment _ of @xmath2 ( with respect to @xmath1 ) we mean any unoriented arc @xmath43 of @xmath2 satisfying @xmath44 .",
    "similarly we define an _",
    "oriented segment_. if @xmath43 is an oriented segment , by @xmath45 we mean the segment equal to @xmath43 as an unoriented segment but with reversed orientation , and by @xmath46 the unoriented segment determined by @xmath43 .",
    "we call a segment @xmath43 of @xmath2 _ one  sided _ [ _ two  sided _ ] if the union of @xmath43 and an arc of @xmath1 connecting @xmath47 is a one  sided [ two  sided ] circle .",
    "an oriented segment is one  sided [ two  sided ] if the underlying unoriented segment is one  sided [ two  sided ] .",
    "oriented segments @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( not necessarily distinct ) of @xmath2 are called _ adjacent _ if both are one  sided and there exists an open disk @xmath50 on @xmath29 with the following properties :    1 .",

    "the vertices of @xmath71 correspond to one  sided unoriented segments of @xmath2 .",
    "if we have two segments which are adjacent through the disk @xmath50 , we join the vertices corresponding to these segments by an edge ( labelled @xmath50 ) .",
