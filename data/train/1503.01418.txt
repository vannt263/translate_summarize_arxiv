    "today understanding poker games , from the mental aptitide of their players to the underlying probabilistic structure , represents a great challenge for scientists belonging to several communities as psychologists , computer scientists , physicists , and mathematicians  @xcite . in general",
    ", these games can be analyzed considering psychological aspects , information theory approaches and analytical descriptions .",
    "notably , approaches based on sociophysics  @xcite allow to study the role of human behavior  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , information theory and analytical approaches allow to identify both new algorithms  @xcite in the context of artificial intelligence  @xcite , and universal properties of these games  @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem , when dealing with poker , is constituted by its classification , i.e. , ` skill game ' or gambling .",
    "this issue has not yet been solved , although the nowadays available related answer has a long list of implications  @xcite .",
    "a preliminary attempt to solve this question , by using the framework of statistical mechanics , has been developed in  @xcite , where the author analyzed the role of rationality in a simplified scenario , referred to the poker variant called texas holdem  @xcite . in general , all variants follow a similar logic : rounders ( i.e. , poker players ) receive a number of cards , and have to decide if to bet or not , by computing the possible combinations they can set with their cards ( called _ hand _ ) . after evaluating if the received hand is promising or",
    "not , each rounder can take part to the pot by placing a bet ( money or chips ) , otherwise she / he folds the _",
    "hand_. therefore , the use of money makes the challenge meaningful , otherwise none would have a reason to fold her / his hand .",
    "poker challenges can follow two different formats , i.e. , cash game or tournament . during a tournament ,",
    "rounders pay , only once , an entry fee : a fraction goes into the prize pool , and the remain part is a fee to play . eventually , top players share the prize pool ( usually money ) . on the other hand ,",
    "playing poker in the cash game format means to use real money during the challenge . in this case",
    ", rounders can play until they have money and , although there no entry fees to pay , a fraction of each pot is taxed , i.e. , a small ` rake ' is applied . in this work ,",
    "we propose a framework to study the evolution of a poker challenge , considering the cash game format , by a thermodynamic description .",
    "in particular , we aim both to model these dynamics to achieve insights , and to link the resulting thermodynamic description with the probability theory tacitly governing these games .",
    "in this work , we aim to describe cash game poker challenges by the language of thermodynamics . in particular , since these challenges entail transfers of money among different parts , i.e. , rounders and dealers , we assume that the way thermodynamics explains equilibria and energy transfers between systems constitutes a fundamental tool to our investigations .",
    "firstly , we consider a simple thermodynamic system composed of the subsystem @xmath0 and its environment @xmath1 .",
    "the total energy of the system @xmath2 is given by the energy of @xmath0 and that of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath3 . in the proposed model ,",
    "the environment @xmath1 is a poker room , whereas @xmath0 corresponds to the table where two rounders , say @xmath4 and @xmath5 , face by a ` heads - up ' challenge .",
    "a ` heads - up ' is a challenge characterized by the presence of only two rounders .",
    "therefore , we can identify two subsystems of @xmath0 : @xmath6 and @xmath7 , corresponding to the two rounders . since poker challenges are performed following the cash game format ,",
    "the money is the exchanged quantity , hence mapping money to the energy of the systems come immediate . in doing so , we have @xmath8 and @xmath9 that correspond to the money of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "therefore @xmath10 and , as initial condition , we impose that at @xmath11 rounders have the same amount of money , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] offers a pictorial representation of the described system .",
    "inside the environment @xmath1 , with the arrow indicating the allowed direction of energy transfers , i.e. , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . on the right , a zoom on the subsystem @xmath0 , showing the two subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 , representing the two rounders ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) . inside @xmath0 , as shown by arrows , the energy can flow from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and vice versa . ]    during the challenge , some rounds are won by @xmath4 and others by @xmath5 ; hence a fraction of energy is transferred from the subsystem @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and vice versa , over time .",
    "the amount of transferred energy @xmath13 corresponds to the total amount of money that flows from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and vice versa . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we consider that at each round rounders bet the same amount of money , i.e. , pots are constant .",
    "in particular , @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 with @xmath15 total flow of energy from the subsystem @xmath16 to @xmath17 , at time @xmath18 .",
    "then , @xmath19 indicates the total amount of enegy transferred from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , as result of all successes of the rounder @xmath5 .",
    "it is worth to note that , in real scenarios , poker rooms apply a small fee , called ` rake ' , to each pot .",
    "usually , the ` rake ' corresponds to about @xmath20 of the pot . as result ,",
    "the total energy of @xmath0 decreases over time by a factor @xmath21 , due to energy transfers between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "since we are dealing with a closed system ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) , the loss in energy can be thought in terms of energy reduction due to the entropy s growth @xmath22 .",
    "notably , this concept characterizes the helmholtz free energy potential @xmath23 @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , energy and temperature of the system , respectively . in few words ,",
    "the free energy corresponds to the energy a system can actually use . then , we can map this concept to our model by the following relation @xmath27 with @xmath28 free energy of our system , that is available at time @xmath18 , after all energy transfers .",
    "the energy lost by @xmath0 goes to the environment @xmath1 , hence @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth to observe that , as the entropy of a system does , the quantity @xmath30 increases over time , and can never be negative .",
    "now , we focus our attention on the evolution of the system .",
    "in particular , we consider one subsystem , i.e. , @xmath6 or @xmath7 , in order to analyze its amount of energy over time .",
    "let us consider , for instance , @xmath6 ( that represents the rounder @xmath4 ) whose evolution can be described by the following relation @xmath31 as the amount of energy in @xmath6 corresponds to the initial amount of energy in this subsystem ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) , minus the amount of energy that flowed to @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) , plus the amount of energy that flowed from @xmath7 to @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) reduced of a factor @xmath35 . in an equilibrium condition , @xmath36 , therefore @xmath37 the primary target of the rounder @xmath4 is to win all the money of @xmath5 , while avoiding to lose her / his money .",
    "hence , rounder @xmath4 aims to obtain @xmath38 . considering poker as a skill game  @xcite , the flow @xmath39 depends on the ability of the @xmath17th rounder .",
    "then , @xmath4 has a probability @xmath40 to win each round , strongly related to her / his skills .",
    "as discussed before , to simplify the scenario , we suppose that rounders bet always the same amount of money @xmath41 , forming the pot @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 . in doing so",
    ", we can define the amount of energy transferred from @xmath7 to @xmath6 as @xmath44 and the amount of energy transferred from @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xmath45 going back to the equilibrium condition defined in equation  [ eq : equilibrium ] , we can write @xmath46 working a little bit of algebra , from equation  [ eq : equilibrium_probability ] , we obtain @xmath47 therefore , we can compute the minimal success probability that the rounder @xmath4 needs to reach her / his target , i.e. , to win ( or , at least , to not losing money ) .",
    "it is worth to highlight that , starting by a thermodynamic description of the system , we can define a relation between the ` rake ' , applied by a poker room , and the rounders skills , i.e. , their probability to success in poker cash game .      in light of these results , it is interesting to evaluate both the amount of money rounders can win by playing poker cash game , and the amount of money the poker room generates during the challenge . considering the rounders s perspective , we are interested in computing the expected value of energy that flows in the subsystem @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath48 ( note that similar considerations hold also for @xmath7 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath48 can be computed as follows @xmath49 @xmath50 corresponds to @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , with @xmath53 representing the total energy transfer from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath57 and we find the following relation @xmath58 =   t \\cdot \\frac{\\delta}{2 } [ p_a \\cdot ( 2 - \\epsilon ) - 1]\\ ] ] that is in perfect accordance with results achieved in equation  [ eq : probability_a_epsilon ] , as for @xmath59 the expected value of energy transferred to @xmath6 is @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , it is immediate to note that , considering equation  [ eq : energy_evolution ] , the rate of variation of the energy of one subsystem ( e.g. , @xmath54 ) corresponds to @xmath61 it is worth to observe that , by all the illustrated equations , it is possible to evaluate the potential gain of a rounder , once her / his winning probability @xmath62 is known .",
    "on the other hand , considering the poker room perspective , the overall scenario becomes pretty nice , because as we are going to show , its profits can only increases over time without running any risk .",
    "notably , the environment @xmath1 ( i.e. , the poker room ) receives a constant amount of energy , at each time step , equal to @xmath63 .",
    "hence , in the event rounders have the same probability to win ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) , it is interesting to compute the number of time steps required to let the poker room drain almost all their money ( i.e. , their energy ) . since to perform a round both rounders have to bet the same amount of money , a minimal amount of energy always will remain in the subsystem @xmath0 . in particular , this quantity is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "hence , supposing both subsystems , at time @xmath18 , contain an energy equal to @xmath41 , the last round entails one subsystem loses completely energy and the other has , at the end , an energy equal to @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the maximum amount of energy that the environment can receive is @xmath66 , so that the following relation holds @xmath67 then , it is possible to compute the number of time steps @xmath18 to let the poker room draining almost all the rounders s money : @xmath68 equation  [ eq : poker_room_time ] shows a direct relation between the time and the rake applied by the poker room : as the latter increases the time to drain almost all the energy decreases .",
    "in this work , we propose a framework for studying poker challenges in the context of thermodynamics .",
    "in particular , we map a simple scenario , where two rounders face , to a thermodynamic system composed of a subsystem @xmath0 embedded in a larger environment @xmath1 .",
    "the former represents the two rounders , whereas the latter the poker room .",
    "remarkably , from a simplified description of the game dynamics , we achieve insights on poker challenges , in the cash game format . even considering this format of poker as a ` skill game ' ( see @xcite ) ,",
    "we identify a direct link between the rounders s skills and the fee applied by poker room , called ` rake ' . in doing so , it is possible to know the minimal probability to success a rounder needs to have in order to be a successful player . as shown , gaining by this activity is a very hard task , even for skilled rounders , as they have to keep their probability to win very high . in real scenarios ,",
    "many expert rounders are very good and fast in computing winning probabilities for their _ hands _ , hence they perform online cash game by a ` multitabling ' strategy : they face at the same time several opponents , with the aim to optimize their profits ( obviously , increasing the probability of losing a lot of money ) .",
    "moreover , we analyze profits of a poker room , obtained while rounders play the cash game poker . in particular , mapping this profit to the energy of the environment @xmath1 , we achieve the relation @xmath69 , with @xmath35 representing the ` rake ' , @xmath42 the pot of each round , and @xmath18 the number of time steps . it is worth noting that there are two different situations that allow the poker room to increase its profits :      while the first should be kept low ( e.g. , @xmath70 or less ) as a strategy marketing to attract rounders in the poker room , the second requires more attention as , in principle",
    ", it can lead to a fraudulent strategy , now we briefly illustrate .",
    "people usually are not worried about frauds in poker , as they play against other people , and not against a dealer ( as in games like the roulette ) .",
    "therefore , in principle , there are no reasons for the electronic dealer to favor a particular rounder in the process of cards distribution .",
    "anyway , it is important to highlight that the poker room does not take an advantage when rounders perform ` all - in ' actions ( i.e. , the bet all their money in only one _ hand _ ) .",
    "then , supposing rounders are rational , i.e. , their actions are performed by considering their probability to win each round , a pseudo - random algorithm for cards distribution could be properly defined for generating uncertain scenarios . here ,",
    "for uncertain scenarios we indicate those situations where both rounders have low winning probabilities , by considering only the information they have ( i.e. , their _ hand _ and , in case , common cards ) .",
    "therefore , a fraudulent strategy could be implemented by using an algorithm to provide rounders with low winning probability at each hand , in order to avoid they perform ` all - in ' .",
    "it is evident that by this strategy , it would be possible to indirectly increasing @xmath18 for each challenge .",
    "moreover , it would be also very difficult to find this kind of fraud by analyzing the algorithm , used by a poker room , if this fraudulent scenario is not considered . in order to conclude",
    ", we would like to emphasize that some of the considerations about the probability to win a cash game challenge can be applied also in the context of financial trading .",
    "in particular , for the strategy adopted by ` scalpers ' , i.e. , traders that in few seconds open and close a position ( i.e. , buy and sell financial products as stocks , bonds , etc . ) , as also in those cases for each transaction the banking system applies a kind of ` rake ' .",
