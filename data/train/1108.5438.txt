    "proton - nucleus collisions serve a dual purpose in the experimental programs with high - energy nuclear beams @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the _ cold nuclear matter _",
    "background is benchmarked by colliding systems where a hot and dense medium is not expected to be produced .",
    "especially relevant for this benchmarking are the studies of nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs )  see @xcite-@xcite for the most recent nlo analyses . on the other hand , new physics domains of qcd , characterized by large gluonic densities in the hadron wave function ,",
    "are expected to be more easily accessible by increasing the atomic number of the colliding objects .",
    "proton - nucleus collisions provide the best possible tool for such studies before a lepton - ion collider is built .",
    "proton - nucleus collisions have been experimentally studied at various energies , from cern sps ( @xmath0 agev ) and fermilab fixed target experiments ( @xmath1 agev ) to bnl rhic ( @xmath2 agev ) . for the last one , deuteron nuclei , instead of protons , were accelerated due to technical reasons .",
    "most of sps or fermilab results refer to quarkonia and drell - yan production with nuclear targets . at rhic",
    "several different observables have been studied , in particular in the forward region , looking for clear signals of saturation of partonic densities  see below .",
    "similarly to these previous experiments , the need of proton - nucleus runs at the lhc has been recognized and studies of feasibility @xcite and detector performance @xcite carried out .",
    "the collision of asymmetric systems at the lhc presents the additional constraints derived from the two - in - one magnet design . from the feasibility of collisions",
    "this is especially relevant during injection and ramp while from the purely experimental conditions , it implies rapidity shifts of the center - of - mass reference frame .",
    "experimental checks of feasibility will be performed in fall 2011 , having in mind the possibility of a first run in 2012 before the long shutdown of 2013 - 2014 .",
    "the kinematic domains studied by the different experimental facilities is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pa ] .",
    "it should be noticed that the actual reach is normally limited by the kinematics of the process under study and smaller than the one plotted .",
    "interestingly , the central rapidity region at rhic had already been explored in previous experiments of deep inelastic scattering with nuclei and drell - yan production in proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "for this reason a check of the universality of the npdfs is possible .",
    "rhic has also explored the forward region , where smaller values of @xmath3 are possible .",
    "the access , for the first time in nuclear collisions , of the tev scale , make the reach of the lhc much wider than any previous accelerator . in particular , values of @xmath3 of the order of @xmath4 , well within the saturation region estimates , can be attained with actual processes . interestingly a large overlap between the lhc and the rhic kinematics is present .",
    "this is very important for cross - checks and for unraveling possible competing cold nuclear matter effects in the data .",
    "8.8 tev at the lhc for different rapidities in the laboratory frame . also shown",
    "are the region of phase space studied by experiments of dis with nuclei and drell - yan production in proton - nucleus collisions ( the two main processes used in global npdf fits ) and the total reach of rhic for @xmath5.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is probably worth mentioning here that the proposed upgrades of the different collaborations @xcite emphasize the physics of the forward rapidities , in which a saturation of partonic densities could appear .",
    "this physics is best studied in proton - nucleus or deuteron - nucleus collisions .",
    "the two - in - one magnet design of the lhc implies an equal rigidity for the accelerated beams .",
    "this fixes the momentum of the nucleus to be @xcite @xmath6 with @xmath7 the number of protons in the pb nucleus .",
    "in general , for the collision of two asymmetric systems @xmath8 and @xmath9 one has @xmath10 which leads for the top lhc energy to @xmath11 atev , @xmath12 0.46 .",
    "the corresponding energy if the first run takes place in 2012 is about a factor of two smaller while the rapidity shift remains unchanged .",
    "the corresponding estimates for the luminosity of a run is @xmath13 the final luminosity will , of course , depend on a number of factors in which the previous experience on the lhc collisions in both and modes will be of special relevance .",
    "the figure quoted above is for the top lhc energy ( it would be slightly smaller for smaller energy ) but takes a rather conservative factor of 10 less intensity than nominal for the proton bunches @xcite , so , larger values could be possible . assuming a total running period of @xmath14 this leads to an integrated luminosity of 0.1 pb@xmath15 .",
    "this luminosity allows to measure hard processes with large virtualities , for example jets are produced copiously , but also rarer processes as @xmath16 production with enough statistics to be of use in global analyses .",
    "the first collisions of deuteron - gold took place at rhic during run 3 in 2003 .",
    "the corresponding results are essential for the interpretation of the data , in particular for the interpretation of _ jet quenching _ as a final state effect and also , to a less extent to calibrate the cold nuclear matter effects in @xmath17 production . at the same time",
    ", the first studies of particle production at forward rapidities started to point to the interpretation of saturation of partonic densities as a plausible one for the strong suppression observed .    concerning the central rapidities , as it was mentioned , the range of @xmath3 and @xmath18 measured by high-@xmath19 inclusive pion production overlaps to a large extent with that from previous data on dis and drell - yan .",
    "this allows to use the global fits to check the factorization hypothesis of the nuclear pdfs , and , indeed , these data were latter included in global fits @xcite providing further constrains to the badly known gluon pdf .    from the point of view of new domains , the most interesting data appear at the forward rapidity .",
    "the typical range of @xmath3 measured in a @xmath20 processes in @xmath21 processes involve integration on a range of @xmath3 leading to a larger average value .",
    "] so rather small values of @xmath3 can be reached at large @xmath22 .",
    "early predictions @xcite-@xcite of qcd non - linear evolution found a strong suppression of the hadronic yields with transverse momentum in the vicinity and above the saturation scale with increasing rapidity .",
    "this suppression was first observed by brahms @xcite in a reduced range of @xmath23 gev . with improved techniques ,",
    "the description of these data in terms of the cgc is rather good @xcite , although some issues remain to be clarified , in particular concerning the implementation of the impact parameter dependence of the nuclear wave function .",
    "however , an analysis in terms of nuclear pdfs is also possible @xcite but showing tension with dis data .",
    "additional effects as energy loss have also been put forward @xcite . in order to clarify the origin of the suppression and the relevance of saturation physics , new observables",
    "have been studied in the last years ( a higher luminosity run was performed in 2008 ) . among them",
    ", the use of correlations could shed new light into the problem : both star @xcite and phenix @xcite have measured a suppression of the back - to - back signal in collisions when both the triggered and the associated particles are in the forward rapidities .",
    "the suppression is especially strong for central collisions .",
    "the studied @xmath19 regions are small ( @xmath24 gev for star and @xmath25 gev for phenix ) but interestingly the data can be described by bk - evolved gluon distributions @xcite .",
    "the lhc nuclear program is in a situation in which no constraints for cold nuclear matter background exist from previous experiments .",
    "this includes the knowledge of the nuclear parton distributions , the nuclear effects on hadronization or even the validity of the collinear factorization .",
    "a program at the lhc will be essential to pindown these uncertainties and to check the new domain of saturated parton densities with unprecedented precision .",
    "we present concisely arguments to support this assertion also in view of the new data presented in the qm2011 conference .",
    "the knowledge of the nuclear parton distribution functions is deficient in the needed kinematical region of the lhc , and also at forward rapidities at rhic .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : npdf ] where the ratio between the gluon distributions in bound over those in free nucleons is plotted for the nlo global fits available at present .",
    "the uncertainty bands are calculated using the hessian method and should be taken as lower limits due to remaining parametrization - bias effects .",
    ", obtained by the nlo global fits eps09 @xcite , hkn07 @xcite and nds @xcite at two different virtualities , @xmath26 gev@xmath27 and @xmath18=100 gev@xmath27.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    , obtained by the nlo global fits eps09 @xcite , hkn07 @xcite and nds @xcite at two different virtualities , @xmath26 gev@xmath27 and @xmath18=100 gev@xmath27.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    generically , the nuclear effects disappear at small-@xmath3 for both sea quarks and gluons with increasing @xmath18 , so they affect less the processes with larger virtualities , but uncertainties remain important for processes like the @xmath17 production  see below .    the only experimental option to reduce these uncertainties in the next decade are collisions . for benchmarking",
    "this is especially relevant for the lhc .",
    "the uncertainties in nuclear pdfs can be reduced by studying different observables both at rhic and the lhc @xcite . among them , the electroweak processes are some of the most promising ones , especially the novel available access to @xmath16 production .",
    "one of the main advantages is that the isospin corrections are almost negligible in @xmath28-production  see fig .",
    "[ fig : bench ]  making the spectrum almost rapidity - symmetric if no modification of the pdfs where present .",
    "this can be exploited to extract the nuclear effects with small sensitivity to the proton pdfs @xcite .",
    "this is true only in asymmetric systems , as , where a forward - backward asymmetry will then directly constrain the nuclear pdfs .",
    "this feature is absent in symmetric collisions and the corresponding sensitivity is much more reduced.with the quoted luminosity for runs at the lhc , the statistics should be large enough for such studies .",
    "for example , 4000 @xmath28 s decaying in dileptons are expected per unit rapidity in at @xmath29 tev , the corresponding yield for @xmath30 is a factor of 10 larger and the corresponding single - lepton measurements are also interesting for npdf studies . on the other hand , process of interest as @xmath28+jet",
    "would probably need a factor of 10 more luminosity for enough statistics @xcite .    during the conference",
    "new data on hard processes in at the lhc have been presented .",
    "this allows us to make first statements about the need of benchmarking and to quantify , in part , what is needed from a run .",
    "we divide the observables according to the relative amount of cold / hot qcd matter effects :    * _ processes where only cold nuclear matter effects were expected _ : interestingly , the first data on @xmath28 and @xmath30 production are available @xcite and the agreement with pqcd factorization plus the glauber model is excellent . more precise measurement of the luminosity and more precise data would , indeed , help to further substantiate this statement and to make the data usable for global fits . *",
    "_ processes where both hot and cold nuclear matter could be of similar size _ :",
    "historically the paradigmatic example for this second kind of processes is the quarkonia suppression in nuclear collisions . from sps to rhic and now to the lhc , a strong suppression of the @xmath17 was measured  now also of different quarkonia states , including @xmath31 s @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cold nuclear matter effects measured in and collisions extrapolated to or lead to suppression of magnitude of the same order as the one observed , so the interpretation of the data requires quantifying these effects with enough precision . for the lhc",
    ", the first data have been presented @xcite in the conference .",
    "they are taken in different kinematical domains and for different particle species .",
    "a complete picture of the suppression will indeed need of a good control over the cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "just to mention two examples : ( i ) taken at face value , the suppression found by alice @xcite for the @xmath17 in the forward region is in agreement with the suppression due to shadowing as given by the eps09 parametrization with no need of extra hot matter effects  see fig .",
    "[ fig : bench ] ; ( ii ) cms measure the excited @xmath31 states to be more suppressed than the @xmath31 ground state @xcite .",
    "old data from @xcite showed , however , no different suppression .",
    "this would point to a genuine hot matter effect measured by cms .",
    "clearly further checks with collisions at the lhc energies and with high statistics are of utmost importance for the physical picture of quarkonia suppression . *",
    "_ processes where cold matter effects are expected to be much smaller than hot matter effects . _",
    "the main example is in this case the production of particles with high transverse momentum , including the reconstructed jets .",
    "this has been one of the main observables discussed at the quark matter conference @xcite . at rhic ,",
    "as commented before , the nuclear pdfs were already explored by previous experiments for the data at central rapidities . at the lhc",
    "this is , however , not the case and , although the bulk of the effect is expected to be due to _ jet quenching _ a precise interpretation would need a better knowledge of the cold nuclear matter effects , which could , for example , change the slope of the single - particle suppression @xmath32 . on the other hand , new data from at rhic @xcite seems to indicate a modification of the jet structures .",
    "some of the theoretical developments in the last year @xcite point to the decoherent gluon emission off the different emitters in the shower as a new relevant contribution .",
    "this decoherence is a very generic phenomena which could affect also jets in .",
    "more theoretical work is indeed needed but a measurement of reconstructed jets in would be welcome .",
    "boson in with and without nuclear effects in the pdfs @xcite . also shown is the case for qed couplings showing larger isospin effects .",

    "rather general arguments imply that the linear regime in the evolution equations of the parton distributions should cease to be valid at a scale @xmath33 in which the proportionality factor and the exponents are not completely known . in the last decade a whole formalism to systematically include these corrections in different approximations has been developed and given the generic name of color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite .",
    "the main realization is a set of evolution equations which are known at nlo and which generalize the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov equations to the non - linear case .",
    "these balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equations at nlo provide the first theoretically controlled tool to apply the formalism in experimental situations and to perform precision checks of the relevance of non - linear terms in the evolution equations @xcite .    the presence of a scale , @xmath34 , which for large enough nuclei or small enough @xmath3 could be in the perturbative region , allows to perform calculations of quantities usually considered to belong to the _ soft _ physics using small coupling techniques .",
    "for example , the total multiplicities in nuclear collisions can be described by the solution of the running coupling bk equations .",
    "nucleus - nucleus collisions is , however , not the best experimental condition to study the physics of saturation due to the presence of final state hot qcd matter effects which effectively wash - out most of the information about the nuclear wave function , except perhaps global quantities as multiplicities or some long range correlations . in this situation ,",
    "collisions offer the best experimental conditions in the next decade before a possible lepton - ion collider as the eic or the lhec are built @xcite .",
    "moreover , the new techniques to study the initial stages of the collision by methods of the cgc call for a benchmarking of the initial wave function of the nucleus for a precise determination of quantities as e.g. the viscosity of the produced medium . in this sense",
    "the benchmarking role of the which was traditionally limited to the hard probes is nowadays of much wider scope @xcite .",
    "proton - nucleus collisions offer a variety of physics to be studied as well as the needed benchmarking conditions for cold nuclear matter background subtraction in nucleus - nucleus .",
    "preliminary studies confirm the feasibility of collisions in the special configuration of the lhc @xcite .",
    "the jump in energy will be a factor of more than 40 at top lhc energy or more than 20 at present energies that of rhic collisions .",
    "the phase space region open for new studies is probably the largest one in the history of particle physics for the same colliding system .",
    "interestingly , this is also one of the rare times in which a large overlap in kinematic regimes is available in two parallel nuclear programs .",
    "this is an ideal situation to reduce the uncertainties by comparing the data in two different experimental situations and the benefits for npdf and/or saturation studies can not be overemphasized .    for the particular case of the lhc",
    ", the goals presented in this paper can not be reached with collisions alone .",
