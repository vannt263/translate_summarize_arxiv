    "the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) is a generic magnetotransport property of ferromagnetic metals first discovered by thomson@xcite back in 1857 . in general , the longitudinal resistance of a bulk polycrystalline ferromagnetic metal shows maximum resistivity when the current is parallel to the magnetization direction , and minimum resistivity when the current is perpendicular to the magnetization direction . the resistance indeed only depends on the relative orientation of the magnetization vector @xmath0 and the current density @xmath1 , and can be cast in the general form@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bulk isotropic resistivity whereas @xmath4 quantifies the amplitude of the amr effect .",
    "the subsequent discovery four decades ago of a few percent amr in transition metals and their alloys has led to the development of amr sensors for magnetic recording@xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the amr can be individuated in the anisotropy of scattering produced by spin - orbit interaction@xcite .",
    "a stronger scattering is indeed expected for electrons travelling parallel to the magnetization , which results in a larger resistivity @xmath5 .",
    "it was subsequently proposed that this effect might also arise in ferromagnetic quasi - one - dimensional nanostructures with characteristic structural dimensions less than the electronic mean free path@xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the electronic transport is ballistic rather than diffusive , and therefore electronic scattering does not contribute to the conductance .",
    "the ballistic conductance of a magnetic nanowire with width of the order of the fermi wavelength @xmath6 is indeed simply given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total number of open conducting channels@xcite . because of the spin - orbit interaction , which is known to be enhanced in open and constrained geometries , the number of transverse modes at the fermi energy changes with the magnetization direction , thereby yielding a ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance ( bamr ) .",
    "the first experimental evidence for the occurrence of the bamr effect has been provided by observing a stepwise variation in the ballistic conductance of cobalt nanocontacts as the direction of an externally applied magnetic field was varied@xcite .",

    "when subject to transversal magnetic fields , the orbital electron motion is governed by the radial field projection , and thus the magnetic field becomes effectively inhomogeneous .",
    "henceforth , the magnetotransport properties of these systems are comparable to those encountered in conventional planar structures in an inhomogeneous magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the fact that transport measurements performed on segments of cylinders have shown a notable asymmetry with respect to the external magnetic field direction@xcite suggests the possible occurrence of a bamr effect whose origin does not stem from spin - orbit coupling , but can be rather individuated in the peculiar quantum motion of electrons in curved nanosystems .    in the current work ,",
