    "this paper is concerned with a discrete coercivity property that ensures the stability of time discretisations of boundary integral equations for wave equations , also in situations such as    - non - linear boundary integral equations ;    - boundary integral equations coupled with a wave equation in an interior domain , with an explicit time discretisation in the domain .    for convolution quadrature based on a - stable multistep methods ( which have approximation order at most two ) ,",
    "it is known from @xcite that the coercivity property is preserved under time discretisation , uniformly in the temporal stepsize . here",
    "we study the preservation of convolution coercivity under time discretisation by runge ",
    "kutta convolution quadrature .",
    "up to a shift in the laplace variable and a corresponding reformulation of the boundary integral equation for an exponentially scaled solution function , we show that the convolution coercivity property is preserved by all convolution quadratures based on algebraically stable runge  kutta methods , which include in particular radau  iia methods of arbitrary order . without any such shift and exponential scaling , the convolution coercivity is shown to be preserved by the two - stage radau  iia method of order three .",
    "we illustrate the use of the discrete convolution coercivity by the stability and convergence analysis of the runge  kutta convolution quadrature time discretisation of a non - linear boundary integral equation for a non - linear scattering problem for the acoustic wave equation .",
    "this problem has been studied with different numerical methods in @xcite .",
    "the discrete convolution coercivity is not needed for the corresponding linear scattering problem , because there the convolution quadrature time discretisation of the linear boundary integral equation can be interpreted as a convolution quadrature discretisation of the convolution operator that maps the data to the solution",
    ". therefore known bounds of the laplace transform of the solution operator and known error bounds of convolution quadrature yield stability and error bounds @xcite .",
    "the same argument can also be used for the coupling of a linear wave equation in an interior domain with the boundary integral equation that describes transparent boundary conditions , provided that the convolution quadrature for the boundary integral equation is based on the same ( implicit ) time discretisation method as for the wave equation in the interior domain .",
    "this precludes explicit time - stepping in the interior . for the coupling of convolution quadrature on the boundary with an explicit time discretisation in the interior , the discrete convolution coercivity as considered in the present paper is needed ; see @xcite for the coupling of implicit bdf2 convolution quadrature on the boundary with explicit leapfrog time - stepping in the domain for acoustic , elastic and electro - magnetic wave equations , respectively .",
    "the paper is organised as follows :    in section 2 we recall the continuous - time convolution coercivity , which is related to a coercivity property of the laplace transform of the ( distributional ) convolution kernel that holds uniformly for all values of the laplace - domain frequency variable in a ( possibly shifted ) right half - plane .",
    "in section 3 we study the preservation of the convolution coercivity under time discretisation by runge ",
    "kutta convolution quadrature .",
    "this preservation depends on the numerical range of the runge  kutta differentiation symbol , which is shown to lie in the right half - plane for algebraically stable runge  kutta methods . with a matrix - function inequality that is obtained as an extension of a theorem of von neumann",
    ", we then prove our main result , theorem  [ thm : rk - pos ] , which yields the discrete convolution coercivity .    section 4 recapitulates error bounds of runge  kutta convolution quadrature shown in @xcite .",
    "in section 5 we apply our results to the time discretisation of the wave equation with a non - linear impedance boundary condition .",
    "we study only semi - discretisation in time , but note that this could be extended to full discretisation with the techniques of @xcite .",
    "the error behaviour is illustrated by numerical experiments in section  6 . in the numerical experiments",
    "it is observed that the convolution quadrature based on the three - stage radau iia method performs well even without the shift and exponential scaling , which is more favourable than our theoretical results .",
    "the following coercivity result is given in @xcite , where it is used as a basic result in studying boundary integral operators for the acoustic wave equation ; see also @xcite for maxwell s equation and @xcite for elastic wave equations .",
    "the result can be viewed as a time - continuous operator - valued extension of a theorem of herglotz from 1911 , which states that an analytic function has positive real part on the unit disk if and only if convolution with its coefficient sequence is a positive semi - definite operation .",
