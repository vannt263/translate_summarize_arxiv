    "@xmath176 wave resonances have long been advocated as being responsible for most of the structure observed in the total cross sections for @xmath177 .",
    "the first peak in the total cross sections has been explained in tree level calculations thanks to the @xmath171(1520 )  @xcite and to interferences with the @xmath170  @xcite . in our coupled - channels model",
    "we confirm the very important role played by the @xmath171(1520 ) , which builds up a large fraction of the first peak in the @xmath160 reaction [ see the right panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : res ] ] . on the other hand",
    "its effect is also sizable on the @xmath91 total cross section , producing an overprediction of this observable in our model . as in the tree - diagram models of refs .",
    "@xcite the peak structure in this reaction is always much more pronounced in the models than in the experimental data .",
    "effects of the @xmath174 are sizable only on the @xmath85 , similar to what was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , but they do not produce a peak structure as the experimental data show .",
    "within the dynamical coupled - channels model constructed from analyzing the single pion production reactions  @xcite , we have investigated the total cross sections and the invariant mass distributions for the double pion photoproduction reactions off the proton in the energy region up to @xmath16 gev . in the low - energy region up to @xmath75 gev , our results agree well with the total cross sections data , in which the direct process @xmath76 plays a crucial role for the reproduction of the data . above @xmath75 gev ,",
    "our current model starts to overestimate the data for @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we have found that the @xmath178 process is most relevant for the @xmath3 reactions and is a major origin of the overestimation in the @xmath102 total cross section .",
    "our model reproduces well the shapes of the invariant mass distributions data except for several @xmath119 invariant mass distributions of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we expect that this deviation provides useful information to improve our current model .",
    "also , we have demonstrated the coupled - channels effects on the double pion photoproduction case , which is of similar size to the @xmath179 case .",
    "it is noted that our current model describes the single pion photoproduction observables in the same energy region quite well .",
    "we thus have examined the origins of our disagreements with the data by considering both the single and the double photoproduction reactions .",
    "we have found that the @xmath97 coupling constant @xmath116 in the @xmath180 transition matrix element plays an important role .",
    "if we reduce its strength determined in ref.@xcite by 25 % to a value close to the quark model value , the magnitude of the @xmath181 total cross section is drastically reduced , while the corresponding changes in the single pion photoproduction observables are negligible .",
    "this finding indicates that a smaller value of @xmath98 will be needed in a combined analysis of the world data of @xmath17 reactions .",
    "we have also investigated the sensitivity of each @xmath182 process to the @xmath66 and @xmath77 reactions .",
    "the @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 processes are found to have significant influence on both the single and the double pion photoproduction observables . in particular",
    ", @xmath185 will be key to fixing the overestimation at the first peak of @xmath186 around @xmath86 gev .",
    "as for the @xmath187 wave resonances , the @xmath188 process is critical for describing the @xmath87 observables up to @xmath86 gev , while it plays almost no role for the total cross sections and invariant mass distributions of @xmath3 reactions .",
    "the @xmath189 process just has a negligible contribution to the @xmath190 observables considered in this paper .",
    "this result for the @xmath191 is consistent with the recent analysis in ref .",
    "the @xmath5 states that are found to be important in determining the single and double photoproduction reactions are indicated in the second and third columns of table  [ tab1 ] .    the results in this paper show clearly that in general the analysis of the single pion production reactions is not enough to pin down the amplitudes associated with the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "to extract the reliable information on the @xmath55 states below @xmath192 gev , at least one needs to perform simultaneous analysis of the single and double pion production reactions .",
