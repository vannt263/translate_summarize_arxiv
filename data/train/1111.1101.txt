    "two decades after pioneering contributions of the likes of quantum cryptography @xcite and teleportation @xcite , quantum information science has nowadays acquired a status of maturity @xcite , having witnessed theoretical and experimental advances which demonstrated in several ways the power of quantum technology @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , fundamental questions of inherent practical relevance remain open , broadly concerning the proper identification of the ultimate _ resources _ behind such a power .",
    "paradigmatic instances of systems suitable for quantum protocols have been , for instance , registers of pure qubits for discrete - variable ( `` digital '' ) quantum computation and cryptography @xcite , and multimode gaussian states of radiation fields for continuous - variable ( `` analog '' ) quantum communication and information processing @xcite .",
    "entanglement @xcite has been the crucial resource on which most studies have focused so far as its presence is crucial for better - than - classical communication performances .",
    "recently , however , there has been more of a push for research in quantum information to go beyond the boundaries of its first generation . in particular , the need to consider more realistic setups where mixedness affects quantum computations in the discrete variable framework @xcite , and the need to go beyond the nutshell of gaussian states and operations to achieve universality in continuous variable computation @xcite have both been strong motivations .",
    "nonclassicality ( i.e. the quantumness of correlations beyond and without entanglement ) @xcite and non - gaussianity @xcite are currently under the limelight due to being recognized as `` power - ups '' for quantum technology , in particular in applications such as quantum computation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite and metrology @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the nonclassicality of correlations in continuous - variable ( cv ) systems beyond gaussian states .",
    "nonclassical correlations , including and beyond entanglement , can be quantified for instance by the _ quantum discord _",
    "@xcite , a measure that aims at capturing more general signatures of quantumness in composite systems .",
    "they are associated e.g.  with the non - commutativity of quantum observables and with the fact that local measurements generally induce some disturbance on quantum states , apart from very special cases in which those states admit a fully classical description .",
    "the interest in quantum discord has risen significantly since it was recognized as the potential resource behind the quantum speed - up in certain mixed - state models of quantum computing such as the dqc1 @xcite , in which entanglement is negligible or strictly vanishing @xcite .",
    "quantum discord @xcite , along with other similar nonclassicality measures @xcite such as the ( ameliorated ) measurement - induced disturbance @xcite and distance - based quantifiers such as the geometric discord @xcite and the relative entropy of quantumness @xcite , typically feature nontrivial optimizations in their definitions .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to identify the least disturbing measurement to be applied on one or more subsystems to extract those nonclassical correlations , rendering their exact computation a formidable task .",
    "closed formulae are available for the quantum discord of a special subclass of two - qubit states @xcite and of general two - mode gaussian states under the restriction of gaussian measurements @xcite .",
    "we consider here a family of two - mode states that are the cv counterparts of two - qubit werner states @xcite .",
    "they are non - gaussian states obtained as mixtures of two gaussian states @xcite , an entangled two - mode squeezed state and a two - mode thermal product state , and find applications in cv quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "studying their nonclassicality beyond entanglement is particularly interesting from a fundamental point of view , as they offer a unique testbed to compare the role of gaussian versus non - gaussian measurements to extract correlations with minimum disturbance from general two - mode cv states .",
    "gaussian states and operations are known to satisfy sharp extremality properties @xcite in the space of all cv states .",
    "however , such results do not apply to quantum discord , rendering the understanding of the structure of ( non)classical correlations even subtler in cv systems compared to finite - dimensional systems , for which general results are known instead @xcite .",
    "we show that the states analyzed here represent instances of quantum states carrying _ genuine _ cv nonclassical non - gaussian correlations , for which the optimization in the discord is achieved _ only _ by an infinite - dimensional component , hence genuinely cv , non - gaussian measurement . in the following",
    "we prove that for a particular type of the non - gaussian cv werner state @xcite ( obtained by mixing a two - mode squeezed state with the vacuum ) quantum discord can be computed _",
    "analytically_. the global optimization in its definition is achieved exactly by photon counting , and such a measurement is strictly less disturbing than any gaussian measurement .",
    "the gap between optimal gaussian measurements ( homodyne detection ) and optimal non - gaussian measurements ( photon counting ) is quantified by the difference of the associated conditional entropies .",
    "the gap is then compared with an entropic measure for the non - gaussianity of the states @xcite , and found to be proportional to it in the low squeezing regime .",
    "the exactly computed discord turns out to be equal to other measures for the quantumness of correlations as well in this special case @xcite .",
    "next , we analyze discord in the most general cv werner state , ideally complementing the analysis of the two - qubit werner state performed originally in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we show that photon counting provides in general a ( not necessarily optimal ) upper bound on quantum discord , that coincides with the measurement - induced disturbance @xcite , and we derive a lower bound on discord as well . finally , we give an example of a cv state which is positive under partial transposition ( ppt @xcite ) , and show that it carries `` weak '' nonclassical correlations , signaled by analytically computable upper and lower bounds on discord which are close to each other and stay small and finite even for infinite squeezing .",
    "our results provide insights into the relationship between the general quantumness of correlations , entanglement distillability and separability in cv systems outside the gaussian scenario . from a practical perspective",
    ", our results identify the key role of non - gaussian measurements such as photon counting to access and extract all nonclassical correlations in general cv states , even in the particular case of non - gaussian states with a positive - everywhere wigner function such as the mixtures of gaussian states studied here .",

    "the hard step in the evaluation of the quantum discord ( [ d2 ] ) is the optimization of the conditional entropy @xmath15 over all povms .",
    "although this can not be done in full generality analytically even for two qubits @xcite the problem is tractable using analytical tools for certain subsets of states and povms , e.g. , for gaussian ones @xcite .",
    "however , the question as to whether gaussian measurements are globally optimal for the extraction of nonclassical correlations from general cv quantum states is essentially open and has not been settled even for gaussian states themselves .",

    "likewise , minimization of the entropy ( [ halpha ] ) with respect to variables @xmath103 and @xmath75 also requires numerics .",
    "this analysis reveals that , within the gaussian povm set , the entropy is minimized by homodyne detection on mode @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting plots of gaussian discord and the true quantum discord ( [ drho0 ] ) ( the latter obtained by photon counting on @xmath8 ) are shown in fig .",
    "the figure clearly shows that apart from trivial cases @xmath106 the gaussian discord is always strictly larger than the discord ( [ drho0 ] ) , meaning that general gaussian measurements are strictly suboptimal ( or , in other words , non - minimally disturbing ) for the extraction of nonclassical correlations in the non - gaussian state .    to shine light on the reasons behind this , we compare the gap @xmath107 quantifying how much gaussian measurements overestimate the actual amount of nonclassical correlations , with a measure of the non - gaussianity @xmath108 of the state @xcite .",

    "in other words , for low squeezing ( say @xmath128 ) , the ( normalized ) gap @xmath129 between optimal gaussian ( homodyne ) and globally optimal non - gaussian ( photon counting ) measurements for the extraction of nonclassical correlations , correctly characterizes and quantitatively reproduces the non - gaussianity @xmath108 of the considered state .",
    "interestingly , @xmath130 this intriguing connection between the nonclassicality gap and non - gaussianity fails to hold for larger values of @xmath59 ; the discrepancy between the two parameters becomes extreme in the limit @xmath131 , when the non - gaussianity diverges while the gap @xmath125 closes to zero . a comprehensive comparison between the normalized gap in discord and the non - gaussianity measure is shown in fig .  [ figap ] .",
    "one may argue , that even a simpler non - gaussian state than that of given in eq .",
    "( [ rho0 ] ) can be found possessing a strictly lower discord for a non - gaussian measurement than for the best gaussian measurement .",
    "for instance , the optimal measurement minimizing the discord in the qubit werner state @xcite , studied in the seminal paper on quantum discord @xcite , is a simple non - gaussian projection onto the first two fock states @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "one can easily check that the optimization over all gaussian measurements gives a strictly higher discord .",
    "let us stress that the nonclassical correlations captured by discord are fundamentally different for the cv werner state ( [ rho0 ] ) considered here and for the qubit werner state .",
    "namely , although our cv werner @xcite is formally a qubit - like state , the globally optimal povm has an infinite number of elements given by projectors onto all fock states .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to show that no povm measurement on mode @xmath8 possessing a finite number @xmath134 of elements @xmath135 , @xmath136 can nullify the conditional entropy @xmath137 and hence also be globally optimal .",
    "namely , the conditional state corresponding to detection of the element @xmath135 has to be a pure state , that is , @xmath138=|\\chi_{i}\\rangle\\langle\\chi_{i}|$ ] in order for the entropy of the conditional state to vanish .",
    "now , consider the element @xmath139 .",
    "the corresponding conditional state @xmath140=\\rho_{0,a}-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|\\chi_{i}\\rangle\\langle\\chi_{i}|$ ] , where @xmath141 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rho0b ] ) by replacing @xmath8 with @xmath6 , can not have neither zero , nor one , nor even any finite number of strictly positive eigenvalues , as this would imply that the state @xmath141 also has a finite number of strictly positive eigenvalues which is not the case [ see equation ] .",
    "therefore , for any finite @xmath134 the conditional state @xmath142 is definitely a mixed state possessing strictly positive entropy and hence resulting in a strictly positive and therefore suboptimal conditional entropy ( i.e. , non - optimal discord ) .",
    "consequently , the globally optimal povm of the qubit werner state is only two - component and thus the qubit werner state is only a trivial embedding of a two - qubit state into an infinitely - dimensional two - mode state space carrying _ only _ qubit - type non - gaussian nonclassical correlations .",
    "in contrast , the cv werner state ( [ rho0 ] ) carries genuinely cv non - gaussian nonclassical correlations that can be optimally extracted only by a _",
    "non - gaussian _ povm measurement with an _ infinite _ number of elements : in this particular case , photon counting .      before going",
    "further let us note that , for a state of the form ( [ sigma ] ) , the global optimality of photon counting ( for the calculation of quantum discord ) follows immediately from the fact that the projection of one of its modes onto a fock state projects the other mode onto the same fock state .",
    "as a consequence the conditional entropy achieves the minimum possible value @xmath144 and the discord is of the form ( [ drho0 ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to find more general mixed states with the same property , for instance , states with the structure @xmath145 with @xmath146 , @xmath147 and the matrix @xmath148 with elements @xmath149 being positive - semidefinite .",
    "a particular example of such states is a convex mixture of an arbitrary number of two - mode squeezed vacua ( [ psinopa ] ) with different squeezing parameters @xmath150 obtained for @xmath151 , where @xmath152 are probabilities and @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "we remark that for _ all _ non - gaussian states of the form the quantum discord can be computed exactly .",
    "the quantum state ( [ rho0 ] ) admits furthermore an analytical calculation of other optimized entropic quantifiers of nonclassical correlations @xcite , encompassing the ` ameliorated ' measurement - induced disturbance @xcite and the relative entropy of quantumness @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as we will now show , both of them coincide with the discord ( [ drho0 ] ) .",
    "this is in complete analogy with the corresponding werner state for two qubits @xcite and for two qu@xmath25its with arbitrary @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the optimized nonclassicality indicator called ` ameliorated ' measurement - induced disturbance ( amid ) is a two - way measure of quantum correlations defined as @xcite @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the quantum mutual information and @xmath157 is the classical mutual information @xcite of the quantum state @xmath158 . here",

    "we finally constructed a particular instance of a non - gaussian state which is positive under partial transposition , and whose upper and lower bounds on discord are analytically computable and allow us to pin down its nonclassical correlations as being quite weak , staying finite even in the limit of infinite squeezing .",
