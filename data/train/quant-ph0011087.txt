    "in recent years there has been a considerable interest in the effect of the _ environment _ on the process of _ quantum measurement_. the measurement of physical variable of a _ microscopic _ system - a system which is described by quantum theory - is usually realized by coupling the system to a _  classical meter_.",
    "the meter itself does not have to be macroscopic , however some of its physical variables , say the position of its center of mass , can be considered as approximately _",
    "classical_. if these variables are chosen to be correlated with those of the system , their readings are related to the measurement of the microscopic properties of the system .",
    "when the measurement process is efficient there is one to one correspondence between the macroscopic readings of the meter and the microscopic quantities , which are set to be measured .",
    "a particle , whose center of mass position serves as a meter , will be identified as a _",
    "pointer_. a theory that starts from a model hamiltonian , which includes only the system , the pointer , and the coupling between them , can not account for the real measurement process .",
    "the reason is that the classical meter is significantly influenced , on the time scale of its motion , by the environment around it .",
    "even though the dynamics of the combined entity - the system , the meter , and the environment - can be described by quantum mechanics , the environment ( _ bath _ ) plays a distinctive role in the process .",
    "the role of the environment is _",
    "formally _ expressed in the quantum description of the experiment in that the system ends up in a _ mixed state _",
    ", rather then in a _ pure state , _ which is the outcome of a ",
    "pure  unitary transformation . while a unitary transformation leaves the entire entity , system , meter and bath , in an _",
    "entangled state , _ so that the pointer s final positions are not definite , but rather display _ interference , _ the environment generates _  decoherence , _ and induces definite final readings of the meter .",
    "the fundamental nature of the quantum theory makes the predictions of the readings _ probabilistic _ , while the decoherence , which is caused by the nature of the environment , is responsible for the _ definite _ positions of the pointer .",
    "that decoherence is induced by the environment was recognized long ago , as was pointed out explicitly almost twenty years ago by zurek @xcite .",
    "this point was previously noticed by zeh @xcite and kbler and zeh @xcite in the early seventies .",
    "soon later caldeira and leggett @xcite , and walls , milburn and collet @xcite have shown , using a harmonic oscillator as their microscopic quantum system , to be _ measured _ , and an ensemble of many harmonic oscillators to model the environment , that indeed the environment introduces decoherence to the density matrix of the quantum system . in ref .",
    "@xcite an initial pure state of two spatially separated gaussian wave - packets of the microscopic system - a harmonic oscillator - are turned by the bath , in an extremely short time , into a well defined mixed state of the two wave - packets .",
    "@xcite starts from a pure state with a superposition of two separated pure coherent states of a harmonic oscillator , and ends up , again due to the interaction with the bath , in a mixed state of the two coherent states .",
    "the quantum interferences between the two wave - packets , or the two coherent states , fade away in an extremely short time .",
    "kbler and zeh @xcite and later zurek _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the coherent states of a harmonic oscillator in a bath are somewhat unique in their decoherence , being almost classical .",
    "collett @xcite has extended the investigation of decoherence using density - matrix calculations for some simple _",
    "open systems_. following the ingenious experiments of the ecole normal superieure group @xcite paz and zurek @xcite have investigated the decoherence in the limit of weak interaction between the ",
    "meter  and the bath .",
    "recently the decoherence of a harmonic oscillator , playing the role of a meter measuring a spin half system , has been studied by venugopalan @xcite .",
    "their model for the bath was the standard one @xcite , namely an ensemble of harmonic oscillators .    in the present paper",
    "we revisit the decoherence problem , and study it more in the context the _  measurement  theory _ in a somewhat different setup .",
    "we consider a simple model to describe a combined system , which is made of three coupled parts , a microscopic atomic system , a measuring apparatus , and a bath .",
    "while the standard model for the bath is an ensemble of independent harmonic oscillators , we consider here a _ gas reservoir _ , namely an ensemble of independent particles , which interact with the meter .",
    "the initial state of a _ spin - half _ atom is set to be _  measured  _",
    "_  _ by the final position of a _ massive particle _ , which is , in turn , in contact with the _ reservoir_. this combined system",
    "is supposed to simulate the entire process of a _  real  _ measurement .",
    "an environment of a gas seems to be more appropriate for the description of the motion of a particle - pointer .",
    "furthermore , by changing the density of the gas one can control the time of decoherence .",
    "the atom interacts for a very short time with the meter , and the state of the two systems is becoming _",
    "entangled_. the two macroscopically separated positions of the pointer , which are now quantum - mechanically correlated with the initial state of the spin , _ interfere _ with each other .",
    "the interaction of the meter with the particles of the bath introduces decoherence , namely is destroying the interference , and making the pointer s readings distinguishable .",
    "the development in time of the entire system is described by a unitary transformation , which originates probability into the dynamics by quantum mechanics .",
    "this evolution in time is conveniently described by the _ density - matrix _ of the entire system . in the treatment of the measurement process",
    ", a pure state is transformed after integrating out the environment into a mixed state , and the notion of the _ collapse _ of the wave function is never being introduced .",
    "the probabilistic nature of microscopic dynamics , which is built into the quantum description , is expressed , at the end of the process , in terms of the two _ potentially definite _ positions of the pointer .    the crucial role of the environment is clearly expressed in the stage where",
    "the density - matrix of the combined system of the pointer and the bath is _ traced over _ the degrees of freedom of the gas particles of the reservoir .",
    "since the exact initial conditions of the bath can not be completely prescribed , the unitary transformation , which controls the motion in time , does not account for the _ complete _ description of the entire process .",
    "the point is that even if we could theoretically prescribe the state of the bath at a given time , it can not be completely decisive for an actual experiment .",
    "the reason is that the rate of change of the environment states is order of magnitudes faster than the inverse time scales of the experiment .",
    "since these time scales in reality are so different , even the notion of _ initial conditions _ is not well defined .",
    "relevant initial conditions can be meaningfully prescribed , for two interacting systems , only when their intrinsic time scales are not orders of magnitudes apart .",
    "a theory , which is being introduced to study a real experiment , has to incorporate these facts into its structure .",
    "it is manifested here by assuming that the reservoir is in _",
    "thermal equilibrium_. this has nothing to do with the consistency of quantum theory , but rather with the role of the real initial conditions of the entity we set to investigate .",
    "it is our opinion that a theory , being a logical construction in terms of a mathematical scheme , is supposed to be correlated with the _ intrinsic approximate nature _ of the results of real experiments , and it has to reflect this facet of physical reality .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we introduce the model to be investigated in terms of the hamiltonians for the spin - half atom , the massive pointer , the gas reservoir , and the interactions among them .",
    "section iii is concerned with the motion of the atom and the pointer without the reservoir .",
    "the quantum interference between the two final positions of the pointer is studied in detail . in section",
    "iv we add the bath into the development in time , introduce the _ fokker - planck _ equation for the pointer in the gas environment , and show how the decoherence is set in . in section v , we discuss the conclusions .",
    "the details of the solution of the fokker - planck equation for the _ wigner _ _ distribution _ is outlined in appendix a. in appendix b we study an intuitive model for the bath , which is simulated by a _ random field _ perturbing the meter , and compare it with the results obtained for the gas reservoir .",
    "we consider the _ measurement _ of the spin components of a _",
    "spin half _ atom .",
    "we introduce , for our _ microscopic system _",
    "@xmath0 i.e. , the _ spin half _ atom , the hamiltonian , @xmath1 which , in the absence of an external magnetic field , has degenerate energy eigenstates    @xmath2    these are also eigenstates of @xmath3 , the component of the spin operator along the @xmath4-axis , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 for the _ up _ or _ down _ states .",
    "we shall take @xmath7 .",
    "our measuring device , the _  _ _ pointer _ , is taken to be a _ massive _ particle of mass @xmath8 ( possibly a heavy atom ) , whose _",
    "center of mass _ position and momentum are @xmath9and@xmath10 respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath11 , of the pointer is then    @xmath12    the pointer is the _ meter _ which is assigned to perform a measurement of the @xmath13components of the spin of the atom .",
    "measurement _ is thought of as a process , which generates a correlation between the measured property of the microscopic system , i.e. the spin component , and say , the final macroscopic position of the pointer . to measure the spin variable @xmath14 , which has the observable outcomes @xmath15",
    ", we adopt , after peres @xcite , the following _ coupling _ hamiltonian :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a c - number time dependent  impact  function , which couples the spin operator to the pointer .",
    "the function @xmath17 has the dimension of velocity , and is active for a very short finite interaction time , @xmath18 .",
    "we wish to point out that one massive atom can play the role of both the pointer and the spin half system , when the internal microscopic variable - the spin - is being coupled for a short time with the center of mass of the atom , as in a stern - gerlach device for example .",
    "the effect of the environment on the pointer is to be studied here assuming the following picture .",
    "the pointer is considered to be immersed in a bath , which is viewed as a set of _ independent identical",
    "particles , _ whose @xmath19-th particle is described by the mass @xmath20 coordinate  @xmath21and momentum @xmath22 and the hamiltonian @xmath23 each of these bath particles interacts with the pointer via a potential @xmath24 and thus the pointer - bath interaction hamiltonian is @xmath25 the total hamiltonian for our system is thus @xmath26    the outline of the procedure employed for the measurement of the spin of the atom is as follows .",
    "suppose that the atom is initially in the state    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the amplitude to find the spin in the @xmath29 state , @xmath30 is the complex conjugate of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this state is to be measured by the position of the pointer after it interacts with the atom .",
    "the initial state of the pointer , which is also described by quantum mechanics , is assumed to be a _",
    "gaussian wave packet _ :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the _ spread _ of the wave packet in @xmath35 , namely , the initial expectation value of @xmath35 is @xmath36 , and that of @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "we take @xmath34 to be as small as possible , to have a better resolution of the position of the pointer .",
    "the change of the state of the pointer in time , due to its interaction with the atom and the environment , is now studied in details , by solving the equation of motion of the pointer and _ eliminating _ the degrees of freedom of the  gas  of field particles surrounding the pointer .",
    "but before we will do that , let us first take a look at the case where there is no bath and the measurement of the spin is attempted with a  free  pointer .",
    "first we consider our system without the environment , and find the time development of the pointer from its given initial conditions . since the  free  spin term of the atom is irrelevant , the hamiltonian is    @xmath39    the state of the combined system , atom and pointer , can be given at the time @xmath40 , by the wave function @xmath41 which is the solution of the schrdinger s equation    @xmath42    with the initial condition    @xmath43    it is convenient to introduce the momentum representation for the pointer , namely @xmath44 and apply the _ fourier transform _ _",

    "we thus observe that the probability to find the pointer , either deflected by @xmath442 for the spin up case , or by @xmath443  for the spin down case , is  performing  a diffusion - like motion in space , which is strongly affected by the random impulses inflicted by the environment .",
    "it is interesting to notice that even in the absence of interaction with the spin particle ( i.e. if @xmath444 ) , the pointer s position would have shown diffusion - like motion of its gaussian wave - packet , with the same time dependent spread , @xmath445 .",
    "this diffusion - like behavior of the pointer , due to the interaction with the environment , is a reminiscent of the classical diffusion of a brownian particle immersed in a fluid @xcite . if we compare the result of eq .",

    "if we consider the environment as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators , with a typical frequency of @xmath451 we get    @xmath452    which approaches the classical limit when @xmath453 the collision rate , @xmath411 which is the inverse _ relaxation time _ , @xmath454 of the pointer , depends of course on the character of the bath .",
    "it is also instructive to estimate the time scale , on which this diffusion broadening becomes so wide , as to erase the record of the measurement .",
    "we can estimate this time , @xmath455 by noting that when the width @xmath456 is comparable with the deflection of the pointer @xmath457 , it becomes difficult to distinguish between the spin up and spin down results , which were previously registered . thus taking @xmath458 which is a necessary condition for a meaningful pointer , and @xmath459 @xmath460 ,",

    "we turn , now , to the off - diagonal term of the spatial probability of the pointer , namely to the _ interference _ term , which is a purely _ quantum mechanical _ effect , like that of eq .",
