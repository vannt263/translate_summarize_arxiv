    "quantum hall array resistance standards ( qhars ) @xcite are integrated circuits in which several quantum hall elements are interconnected to compose a resistive network .",
    "the so - called _ multiple - series _ and _ multiple - parallel _ connections ( see @xcite and references therein ) allow the realization of four - terminal resistances with negligible effect from contact and wiring resistances .",
    "national metrology institutes maintain and disseminate the unit of electrical resistance through artifact resistance standards having decadic nominal values , such as , , .",
    "resistance metrology would strongly benefit from the development of reliable qhars having resistance values close to decadic values , because the calibration of artifact standards could thus be performed by 1:1 ratio bridges , which do not require ratio calibration , or even by substitution .",
    "qhars require dedicated foundries and the development of novel realization methods , in particular for what concerns wiring and insulation . although the present integration level allows the realization of qhars with hundreds of elements , a basic goal of qhars design is to maximize simplicity , keeping the number of the elements to a minimum .",
    "recent papers have shown that the same approximation of a decade resistance value @xmath0 can be realized with networks having a greatly different number of elements ; for example , in the realization of a @xmath1 qhars , the national metrology institute of japan ( nmij ) evolved from a 266-element network  @xcite to a 16-element one  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to give advice on the synthesis of qhars networks which approximate a given resistance value within the accuracy required in resistance metrology and employing a minimal number of elements .",
    "a qhars is a circuit composed of interconnected elements having the same resistance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the von klitzing constant and @xmath4 is the _ plateau index _",
    "( typically , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the total resistance @xmath0 of a qhars is a fraction of the element resistance , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are positive integers which depend only on the network topology .",
    "the main goal in the design of a qhars is to obtain a device having a resistance value close to a target value @xmath9 . in the following ,",
    "for ease of notation , we consider the normalized dimensionless quantities @xmath10 ( a generic real number ) and @xmath11 ( a rational number ) .",
    "the problem of qhars network synthesis can be divided into the following steps :    1 .",
    "find a rational approximation @xmath12 of @xmath13 such that the magnitude of the relative error @xmath14 is less than a specified limit @xmath15 , that is @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   synthesize an optimal network with normalized resistance @xmath17 with a minimal number @xmath18 of elements .",
    "in this section we consider the problem of obtaining a rational approximation for a given positive real number . historically , this problem was of particular interest to clockmakers , who had to design accurate gear trains , and led the french clockmaker achille brocot to conceive the useful construction which is discussed below .",
    "the so - called stern - brocot tree  @xcite is a binary tree whose nodes are in one - to - one correspondence with the set of positive rational numbers .",
    "in particular ( figure  [ fig : sb_tree ] ) , each node is the mediant fraction @xmath19 of the left and right nearest ancestors @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( the fractions that can be reached by following the branches upward ) ; the root node is the fraction @xmath22 , generated from the fictitious ancestors @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the importance of stern - brocot tree in the approximation theory rises up by considering the sequences of rationals , namely the stern - brocot sequences , obtained by walking down the nodes of the tree .",
    "given a real number @xmath13 , the corresponding stern - brocot sequence @xmath25 can be generated by walking down the tree according to the following rules ( see figure  [ fig : sb_treewalk ] ) : start from the tree root @xmath26 ; then , for each @xmath27 , if @xmath28 , set @xmath29 equal to the left child of @xmath30 ; otherwise , if @xmath31 , set @xmath29 equal to the right child ; if , for some @xmath32 , @xmath33 , stop ( if @xmath13 is rational , the sequence is finite ) .",
    "the stern - brocot sequence @xmath25 obtained in this way converges to @xmath13 ; moreover , the terms of the sequence are rational approximation of @xmath13 that are optimal in the following sense : if a certain rational approximation of @xmath13 does not belong to the sequence , than there is a term of the sequence having smaller numerator or denominator which is a better approximation  @xcite .",
    "a known method to approximate real numbers is that of continued fraction expansion . a continued fraction is a representation of a real number @xmath13 through a sequence of integers as follows : @xmath34 where the integers @xmath35 are given by the recurrence relations  @xcite @xmath36\\,,\\\\   \\xi_{k+1}=\\frac{1}{\\xi_k-\\alpha_k}\\ ,",
    ", \\quad\\text{if $ \\xi_k$ is not an integer},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath39 .",
    "a continued fraction can be expressed in a compact way using the notation @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the finite continued fractions @xmath41 $ ] , for @xmath42 , are rational approximations of @xmath13 . given a real number @xmath13 , all the rational approximations obtained by continued fraction expansion",
    "are included in the stern - brocot sequence associated to the same @xmath13 : therefore , approximations obtained by continued fraction expansion need not to be considered separately .",
    "this section considers the problem of synthesizing a planar resistive network from a given rational approximation @xmath12 of the target resistance @xmath13 . in the following , we consider @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be coprimes . furthermore , since we are dealing with normalized quantities , all elements are of unit value .",
    "the systematic generation of such networks was investigated in  @xcite .    for a certain @xmath17 , several different equivalent networks having a different number @xmath18 of elements can be synthesized .",
    "a simple example is shown in figure  [ fig : net_6x5 ] , where @xmath43 is obtained with two different networks .    .",
    "the network on the left has @xmath44 elements , while that on the right has @xmath45 elements . ]",
    "a basic network which realizes @xmath46 in a trivial way is the rectangular network of figure  [ fig : net_pxq ] , which is composed of @xmath47 elements arranged in a rectangular grid of height @xmath7 and width @xmath8 . for each element ,",
    "the normalized voltage drop is @xmath48 and the corresponding normalized current is @xmath49 .     network .",
    "( b ) a @xmath50 square of elements has been substituted with a single element . ]",
    "( b ) a @xmath50 square of elements has been substituted with a single element . ]",
    "+    ( a )    ( b )    as shown in figure  [ fig : net_pxq ] , the rectangular network can be transformed into an equivalent one with fewer elements , by substituting a `` square '' of @xmath51 elements with a single element .",
    "this new element will sustain a normalized current @xmath52 and a voltage drop @xmath53 will develop on it  @xcite .",
    "the substitution process can be iterated , and any remaining square of elements having side @xmath54 can be substituted with a single element .",
    "the reader can appreciate that the problem of finding equivalent networks has been related to a geometrical problem : * given a rectangle having integer sides @xmath7 and @xmath8 , find a tiling of the rectangle with squares of integer sides *  @xcite .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : net_6x5_tiled ] shows the two tilings of a @xmath55 rectangle corresponding to the two different networks of figure  [ fig : net_6x5 ] ; each square of side @xmath56 corresponds a single element , which sustains a voltage @xmath57 and a current @xmath58 .",
    "rectangle corresponding to the networks of figure  [ fig : net_6x5 ] . ]",
    "the problem of finding a network with value @xmath46 having a minimal number of elements is therefore related to the problem of finding a tiling of the rectangle with integer sides @xmath59 with the minimum number @xmath60 of integer - sided squares . this problem has been widely studied ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and",
    "the following properties of @xmath60 are known  @xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath61 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath62 , where @xmath63 are the elements of the continued fraction expansion of @xmath64 ; 3 .",
    "[ property : splitting ] @xmath65 , if @xmath66 ; or , symmetrically , @xmath67 , if @xmath68 .",
    "this property means that for long and thin rectangles for which one of the given conditions is met , the tiling problem can be reduced to that of a smaller rectangle because the tiling includes at least a square with side equal to the shortest side of the original rectangle .",
    "even though a general solution to the minimal tiling problem is not yet known , there exists an algorithm that performs an exhaustive search  @xcite . to date , all the solutions for @xmath69 are known . for larger rectangles , even by taking into account property  ( [ property : splitting ] ) to reduce the problem , exhaustive search becomes unfeasible because extremely time - consuming . to overcome this issue , a possibility is that of weakening the condition required in property  ( [ property : splitting ] ) , so that the original rectangle can be reduced as much as possible before applying exhaustive search , at the cost of accepting possibly non minimal solutions . in this work , where needed , on the basis of  @xcite , the following weakened form of property  ( [ property : splitting ] ) is considered ) can lead to non minimal solutions can be demonstrated by considering a @xmath70 rectangle for which @xmath71  @xcite . ]",
    "[ property : splitting_weak ] @xmath65 , if @xmath72 ; or , symmetrically , @xmath67 , if @xmath73 .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that , for a network with normalized resistance @xmath12 and a certain associated tiling , the ratio @xmath74 between the maximum and the minimum currents in the network is given by the ratio of the side of the largest square of the tiling to that of the smallest square .",
    "this follows from the fact noted above that the normalized current which flows through an element corresponding to a square of side @xmath32 is @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio @xmath74 is an additional figure - of - merit associated to a network  @xcite .",
    "in qhars realized with gaas technology , the plateau index of interest is @xmath5 , so @xmath75 .",
    "the recommended value of the the von klitzing constant is @xmath76 $ ] , giving @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the conventional value adopted internationally for realizing representations of the ohm is @xmath78 , giving @xmath79 .",
    "the relative difference between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is . in the following ,",
    "the normalization resistance employed to compute @xmath13 and @xmath82 is @xmath81 ; however , since approximations @xmath17 to @xmath13 are considered of interest if @xmath83 , the results maintain their validity when @xmath84 is instead considered .",
    "we investigate here approximations of decadic resistance values , in particular the values , , , and .",
    "these values are often those for which a set of artifact resistance standards is maintained , are typically calibrated for dissemination , and are the goal of previous works on qhars design  @xcite . with available qhars of these values ,",
    "the dissemination process could proceed mainly by substitution or @xmath85 comparison calibrations , which do not require the availability of resistance ratio standards that can affect the calibration uncertainty .",
    "table  [ tab : summary ] gives a summary of the results of this investigation .",
    "for each decadic value @xmath9 , the normalized ratio @xmath86 is evaluated .",
    "a sequence of rational approximations of @xmath13 is generated from the stern - brocot tree .",
