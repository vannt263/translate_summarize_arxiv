    "nss with masses close to the maximum allowable mass ( @xmath17 , for different model eoss ) have massive inner cores .",
    "ns cooling is calculated with a cooling code ( e.g. , ref .",

    "nss may have different masses , surface magnetic fields , composition of surface layers , etc . , but they are supposed to have the same eos and superfluid properties of internal layers . in the absence of exact microscopic theory of ns matter we will use several model eoss and phenomenological superfluidity models .",
    "the main regulators of ns cooling are : + ( _ a _ ) eos and composition of ns cores which affect neutrino emission mechanisms ; + ( _ b _ ) superfluidity of baryons in nss  it affects neutrino emission and heat content ; + ( _ c _ ) the presence of light elements ( accreted envelopes ) and strong magnetic fields in ns surface layers .",

    "superfluidity suppresses traditional neutrino emission mechanisms ( the modified and direct urca processes and nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung ) but opens a new neutrino process associated with cooper pairing of baryons @xcite .",
    "figure [ supnu ] shows some phenomenological @xmath26 and @xmath27 curves ( from ref .",

    "[ fig - low - mass ] are the same as the solid lines , but the proton critical temperature @xmath27 is reduced by a factor of 6 .",
    "weaker proton superfluidity relaxes the superfluid suppression of the modified urca processes and lowers the cooling curves ( with respect to the solid ones ) .",
    "nevertheless , such superfluidity is still sufficient to interpret the observations : old hot sources are consistent with the thick dashed line ( no accretion envelope ) while young hot sources are well explained assuming an accreted envelope ( thin dashed line ) .",
    "finally , the dotted curve is the same as the thin dashed curve but the mass of the accreted envelope is assumed to decrease with time ( e.g. , due to diffuse burning @xcite ) as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 years .",
    "this model can also explain the observations of nss hottest for their ages .",

    "the solid lines refer to a non - accreted ( fe ) surface .",
    "the dot - and - dashed lines are for the thickest accreted ( he and c ) envelope that can survive with respect to nuclear burning . because he and c have higher thermal conductivity than fe",
    ", their presence makes the ns envelope more heat - transparent , increasing @xmath1 .",
    "high - mass nss have large central densities , masses @xmath33 , and contain massive inner cores .",
    "microscopic theories predict that , as a rule , superfluidity dies out ( and does not suppress neutrino emission ) in the central parts of such stars .",
    "one can propose very different cooling scenarios of high - mass nss .",
    "the simplest scenario assumes non - superfluid nucleon cores where the direct urca process is forbidden .",
    "the corresponding cooling curves would be the same as the basic curve in fig .",
    "[ obs ] ; they can not explain all the observations .",
    "it is widely thought that the neutrino emission in high - mass nss is _ enhanced _ as compared to the emission provided by the modified urca process .",
    "an enhanced emission would lead to _ fast _ cooling , allowing one to explain the observations of nss coldest for their ages .",
    "there are different enhancement levels for different models of ns internal structure .",
    "four scenarios are presented in fig .  [",
    "the left panel is a rough sketch of the neutrino luminosity as a function of @xmath14 at @xmath34 k. one can generally assume a slow neutrino emission in low - mass nss ( e.g. , provided by the neutrino bremsstrahlung in neutron - neutron collisions ) , an enhanced neutrino emission in high - mass nss , and the transition from the slow to enhanced emission with increasing @xmath14 in medium - mass nss .",
    "the mass range of medium - mass stars is model dependent @xcite . in massive nss @xmath35 scales as @xmath36 for all scenarios except for cooper pairing scenario ( where @xmath37 @xcite ) .",
    "in low - mass nss , @xmath37 .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ four ] shows the limiting cooling curves for each scenario ( no accreted envelopes ) .",
    "the upper curve refers to low - mass nss .",
    "their cooling is the same for all scenarios , and it explains the observations of nss hottest for their age ( sect .",
    "[ low - mass ] ) .",
    "four lower curves show cooling of maximum - mass nss for four scenarios .",
    "they are the lowest cooling curves in these scenarios .",
    "the three lowest curves are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , while the fourth is from ref .",
    "the range of @xmath3 between the upper curve and a lower curve can be filled by cooling curves of nss with masses from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we have four different ranges of @xmath3 ( four hatched regions ) for four scenarios .    the highest enhancement of neutrino emission is provided by the direct urca ( durca ) process in nucleon ( or nucleon - hyperon ) cores @xcite .",
    "this scenario predicts the coldest massive nss and the widest theoretical @xmath3 range . if the direct urca process is forbidden but pion condensate is present in the inner ns core , the enhancement of neutrino emission is provided by the process of durca type involving quasi - nucleons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this enhancement is weaker , the massive stars are hotter , and the acceptable @xmath3 range narrower . if pion condensate is absent , but kaon condensate available , the neutrino emission enhancement ( in durca - type processes involving quasi - baryons @xcite ) is even weaker and the @xmath3 range narrower .",
    "nearly the same enhancement is expected in nss with non - superfluid inner cores composed of quarks .",
    "finally , the lowest enhancement can be produced in nucleon inner cores @xcite , where the direct urca process is forbidden but mild superfluidity ( e.g. , of neutrons ) is available ( see sect .",
    "[ sect - cooper ] ) .",
    "it triggers the cooper pairing neutrino emission which accelerates ns cooling .",
    "it gives the narrowest theoretical region of @xmath3 .",
    "as seen from fig .  [ four ] , all four scenarios are compatible with the observations .",
    "the next question , crucial for explaining the observations ( e.g. , of the vela and geminga pulsars ) , is how cooling curves fill hatched regions in fig .  [",
    "four ] if we vary the ns mass from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "the answer @xcite is closely related to the contrast of slow and enhanced neutrino luminosities and the mass range of medium - mass nss in fig .  [",
    "let us outline this problem for nss with nucleon cores .",
    "figure [ fig - weigh ] shows cooling of nss of several masses with the same eos as in fig .",
    "[ supnu ] ( no accretion envelopes ) . in the left panel",
    "we take into account strong proton pairing p , which extends to densities @xmath25 . as long as @xmath40 k",
    ", it suppresses the modified and even the direct urca process and leads to very slow neutrino emission . at higher @xmath41 it gradually dies out , opening the direct urca process .",
    "the gradual opening broadens the direct urca threshold ( fig .",
    "[ supnu ] ) and ensures the gradual decrease of cooling curves with increasing @xmath14 . in this way we may attribute masses to observed nss @xcite . for instance",
    ", we obtain @xmath42 for the vela pulsar . however , this _ weighing _ of nss is sensitive to the eos of dense matter , the threshold of the direct urca process , and the superfluidity model @xmath27 .",
    "were superfluidity absent , the transition from slow to fast cooling would occur in a very narrow mass interval ( @xmath43 ) , and the successful interpretation of the data would be unlikely ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      the cooling effect of neutrino emission due to",
    "cooper pairing of nucleons may be different .",
    "for instance , let us assume the presence of neutron pairing nt with the peak of @xmath26 as low as @xmath44 k at @xmath45 g  @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ supnu ] ) .",
    "this superfluidity is mild and insignificant , according to nuclear physics standards , but crucial for ns cooling .",
    "it appears in a cooling star when the internal temperature falls below the peak value .",
    "it creates then a powerful neutrino emission owing to cooper pairing of neutrons in outer ns cores ( especially efficient in low - mass nss ) .",
    "the emission accelerates ns cooling , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - weigh ] , and violates the interpretation of the observations of such sources as psr b105552 .",
    "thus , this mild neutron superfluidity contradicts the observations .    the opposite example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig - cooper ] .",
    "let us consider nss with nucleon cores and employ the eos @xcite which forbids the direct urca process in all nss with @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , let us adopt the model of strong proton pairing p1 and mild neutron pairing nt1 ( the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - cooper ] ) .",
    "pairing p1 is similar to pairing p in fig .",
    "[ supnu ] ; it suppresses the modified urca process in low - mass nss .",
    "the peak of @xmath26 for pairing nt1 is as low as for pairing nt but shifted to higher densities .",
    "accordingly , pairing nt1 is inefficient in low - mass stars and does not speed up their cooling .",
    "however , the enhanced neutrino emission owing to this pairing operates in massive nss and accelerates their cooling ( a scenario considered in sect .",
    "[ high - mass ] , fig .",
    "[ four ] ) .",
    "then , as seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - cooper ] , the cooling of nss of different masses enables us to explain the data . in this case",
    "mild neutron pairing is useful for interpretation of the observations but a successful interpretation is possible only under stringent constraints on the @xmath26 profile @xcite .",
    "moreover , a discovery of a new ns slightly colder than those observed now would ruin this interpretation .",
    "we have outlined several possible scenarios of ns cooling . in particular ,",
    "we have considered cooling of nss with nucleon ( nucleon / hyperon ) cores , and cores containing exotic phases of dense matter .",
    "we have shown that many scenarios are currently compatible with observations of thermal radiation from isolated nss .",
    "our main conclusions are :    \\(i ) some nss ( e.g. , rx j082243 or psr b105552 ) are hotter and some ( e.g. , the vela pulsar ) colder than non - superfluid nss which cool via the modified urca process .",
    "hotter nss are possibly low - mass stars , while coldest observed nss are possibly more massive .",
    "\\(ii ) currently , the observations unable one to discriminate between many cooling scenarios .",
    "however , they seem to rule out mild superfluidity with the peak of the critical temperature @xmath47 between @xmath48 and @xmath49 k at @xmath50 g  @xmath11 in ns cores",
    ". this superfluidity would initiate cooper pairing neutrino emission in low - mass nss hampering the interpretation of the observations of old and warm nss , such as psr b105552 .",
    "in contrast , mild superfluidity with the peak of @xmath47 at _ higher _ @xmath41 can be useful for interpretation of the observations .",
    "we have discussed main cooling scenarios but not all of them .",
    "some others are reviewed in refs .",
    "actually , the effects of superfluidity are more sophisticated than discussed above . for instance , cooling curves do not change qualitatively by exchanging @xmath47 for neutrons and protons @xcite .",
    "strong superfluidity of all baryon species ( with peaks of @xmath47 higher than @xmath51  k ) leads to a very low heat capacity of nss .",
    "such stars appear at the photon cooling stage earlier than at @xmath52 years ; they are too cold at that stage .",
    "weak superfluidity , with @xmath53 k , does not occur in nss of ages @xmath20 years and does not affect their cooling .",
    "cooling of low - mass nss can be strongly affected by singlet - state pairing of neutrons in inner stellar crusts .",
    "new observations of nss are required for a better understanding of their internal structure .",
    "new discoveries of cold nss would be especially useful .",
    "observations of cooling nss can be analyzed together with other observational data , for instance , with observations of quiescent thermal emission from nss in soft x - ray transients ( see @xcite , for references ) .",
    "this would allow one to obtain more stringent constraints on ns structure .",
