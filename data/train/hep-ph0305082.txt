    "in the standard model ( @xmath11 ) of elementary particle interactions , the breaking of electroweak symmetry is achieved through the higgs mechanism .",
    "the simplest realization is provided by the introduction of a complex higgs doublet , which leads to the presence of a neutral @xmath1-even higgs boson in the physical spectrum . among the possible extensions of the @xmath11 ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( @xmath12 ) has been considered most seriously .",
    "the minimal realization of the higgs mechanism within supersymmetric extensions of the standard model requires the presence of two higgs doublets at low energies . after the higgs mechanism operates ,",
    "five real fields remain , and there should be five spin zero higgs fields , and the spectrum includes also a pseudoscalar @xmath1-odd state .",
    "this non trivial assignment of the quantum numbers requires the investigation of experimental opportunities to measure the parity of the higgs boson states .",
    "the investigation of the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking is one of the central task of a future @xmath13 linear collider operating at center - of - mass energies between @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath8 .",
    "this accelerator will allow to study completely and with high accuracy also the profile of the higgs sector .",
    "the problem of the higgs boson(s ) parity measurement was approached in general form quite early in ref.@xcite for higgs decays into fermions and gauge boson pairs .",
    "it has recently been revived @xcite .    in this study",
    "we investigate the case of a higgs boson which is light enough that the @xmath16 decay channel remains closed .",
    "then the most promising decay channel of neutral higgs particles is the @xmath17 channel , @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "this applies in the @xmath11 as well as in the minimal supersymmetric extension like @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , due to depolarization effects in the fragmentation process , it is very difficult to extract information on the @xmath20 polarization state @xcite .",
    "a much cleaner channel , though with branching ratios suppressed by an order of magnitude , is the @xmath21 mode , @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath21 channel is useful in the @xmath11 for higgs masses less than @xmath24 @xmath8 . up to this mass ,",
    "the higgs particle is very narrow , @xmath25 @xmath26 . in supersymmetric theories ,",
    "the @xmath21 channel is useful over a much larger mass range .",
    "the main production mechanism of the @xmath11 higgs boson in @xmath9 collisions in the future linear collider ( @xmath27 ) are the higgsstrahlung process , @xmath28 and the @xmath29 fusion process , @xmath30 .",
    "the cross section for the higgsstrahlung process scales as @xmath31 and dominates at low energies while the cross section for the @xmath29 fusion process rises as @xmath32 and dominates at high energies @xcite . at @xmath33 @xmath8 , the higgsstrahlung and the @xmath29 fusion processes have approximately the same cross section for @xmath34 @xmath8 @xmath35 @xmath8 .    in our analysis",
    ", we will take as an example the @xmath28 ; @xmath36 ; @xmath37 production process .",
    "we discuss a method for the parity measurement of the higgs boson with a mass of @xmath7 @xmath8 for the case of @xmath9 collisions with @xmath33 @xmath8 using @xmath38 ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; @xmath41 decay chains .",
    "all the monte carlo samples have been generated with the tauola library @xcite .",
    "for the production of the @xmath42 lepton pairs the monte carlo program pythia 6.1 is used @xcite .",
    "the effects of initial state bremsstrahlung were included in the pythia generation . for the @xmath42 lepton pair decay with full spin effects included in the @xmath43 ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; @xmath46 chains , the interface explained in refs.@xcite was used .",
    "it is an extended version of the standard universal interface of refs.@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the theoretical considerations used to understand the decay chain of the higgs particle are explained . in section 3 and 4",
    "we define the observables we use to distinguish between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs boson in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 decays respectively . in these sections",
    "we list our assumptions on detector effects and the imposed cuts as well as the main numerical results .",
    "a summary closes the paper .",
    "the @xmath47 parity information must be extracted from the correlations between @xmath48 and @xmath49 spin components which are further reflected in correlations between the @xmath42 decay products in the plane transverse to the @xmath0 axes .",
    "this is because the decay probability , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath50 is sensitive to the @xmath51 polarization vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( defined in their respective rest frames , the @xmath54-axis is oriented in the @xmath49 flight direction ) .",
    "the symbols @xmath55/@xmath56 denote components parallel / transverse to the higgs boson momentum as seen from the respective @xmath51 rest frames .",
    "this suggests that the experimentally clean @xmath0 final state may be the proper instrument to study the parity of the higgs boson .",
    "now , a few representative examples of the @xmath42 lepton decay will be discussed in more detail . in particular , we analyze the @xmath42 decay into one and two pions .",
    "exploring transverse spin correlations in the higgs boson decay @xmath58 ; @xmath59 one can provide a model independent parity determination test .",
    "the method relies on the properties of the higgs boson yukawa coupling to the @xmath42 lepton , which in the general case can  be written as @xmath60 .",
    "the method does not depend on the higgs boson production mechanism at all .",
    "even though the @xmath44 decay mode is rare , @xmath61 , it may serve as a simple example that illustrates the basic principles .",
    "the spin of the @xmath4 leptons is not directly observable but translates directly into correlations among their decay products . to demonstrate this we define the polar angles between the @xmath62 and the @xmath49 direction in the @xmath4 rest frames by @xmath63 and the relative azimuthal angle @xmath64 between the decay planes .",
    "the angular correlation between @xmath0 decay products may then be written as @xcite @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{equation1}\\ ] ]    a simple asymmetry in the azimuthal angle that projects out the parity of the particle can be derived @xcite by integrating out the polar angles @xmath66 . \\label{equation2}\\ ] ] a useful observable sensitive to the parity of the decaying higgs particle is the angle @xmath67 between the two charged pions in the higgs boson rest frame @xcite .",
    "this delicate measurement will require , however , the reconstruction of the higgs boson rest - frame .",
    "it is generally accepted that the monte carlo method is the only way to estimate whether the measurement can be realized in practice , and which features of the future detection set up may turn out to be crucial . to enable such studies",
    "we have extended the standard universal interface@xcite , of the tauola @xmath42-lepton decay library @xcite , to include the complete spin effects for @xmath42 leptons originating from the spin zero particle@xcite .",
    "the interface is expected to work with any monte carlo generator providing higgs boson production , and subsequent decay into a pair of @xmath42 leptons .",
    "let us turn to the discussion of numerical results .",
    "as an example we took a higgs boson of @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "[ rysunek1 ] presents the distribution in the angle @xmath68 where @xmath69 _ i.e. _ the acoplanarity angle .",
    "thick lines will denote predictions for the scalar higgs boson and thin lines for the pseudoscalar one .",
    "the distribution is indeed , as it should be , proportional to @xmath70 respectively for scalar and pseudoscalar higgs boson , see eg.([equation2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ rysunek3 ] we plot the distribution of the @xmath71 acollinearity angle ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the difference between the case of a scalar and a pseudoscalar higgs boson is clearly visible , especially for acollinearities close to @xmath73 .    to test the feasibility of the measurement , some assumptions about the detector effects have to be made .",
    "we include , as the most critical for our discussion , effects due to inaccuracies in the measurements of the @xmath62 momenta .",
    "we assume gaussian spreads of the ` measured ' quantities with respect to the generated ones . for charged pion momentum",
    "we assume a 0.1% spread on its energy and direction .    if the information on the beam energies and energies of all other observed particles ( high @xmath74 initial state bremsstrahlung photons , decay products of @xmath75 _ etc . _ ) are taken into consideration the higgs boson rest frame can be reconstructed .",
    "we may define the `` reconstructed '' higgs boson momentum as the difference of the sum of the beam energies and the momenta of all visible particles , that is decay products of the @xmath75 and all radiative photons of @xmath76 . in our study",
    "we will mimic in a very crude way the beamstrahlung effects , assuming only a flat spread over the range of @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath8 for the longitudinal component of the higgs boson momentum with respect to the generated one .",
    "[ rysunek6 ] shows us the distribution of the acollinearity angle ( @xmath79 ) build from smeared @xmath62 momenta defined in the reconstructed higgs boson rest - frame .",
    "the difference between the scalar and the pseudoscalar higgs bosons is only barely visible .",
    "we have studied several mechanisms of higgs boson production , in all cases depletion of the acollinearity distribution sensitivity to transverse spin effect was quite similar .",
    "we can conclude that our results are thus independent from the production mechanism .    the beamstrahlung effect taken into account in the reconstruction of the higgs boson four - momentum degraded the method of measuring the higgs boson parity using the decay chain @xmath80 , @xmath81 in a decisive way .",
    "therefore , there is little hope for the elegant method to check the higgs boson parity using its decay to @xmath59 , whatever the luminosity of the future linear collider is assumed , unless other , unfortunately less sensitive , to spin , than @xmath81 , decay modes are used as well .",
    "the discussion of the @xmath42 decay to a two pion final state follows very much the same line .",
    "we may treat the hadron system as a single particle with definite spin and mass , @xmath82 , or we may extract additional information from the individual pion momenta .",
    "the first strategy leads to a simple generalization of the single pion case .",
    "however , the effect is diminished as compared with the @xmath4 decays to single @xmath5 .",
    "this is because for the @xmath45 decay the angular correlation term is reduced by the factor @xmath83    @xmath84 @xmath85\\right ] .",
    "\\label{equation2}\\ ] ] the mass of the hadronic system , @xmath86 , can no longer be neglected relative to @xmath87@xcite .",
    "let us turn to the case when additional information coming from @xmath88 decay products can be used directly@xcite .",
    "the @xmath89 decay is very interesting because it has , by far , the largest branching ratio , @xmath90 .",
    "the polarimetric force of this channel can be improved if information on the @xmath91 decay products , _ i.e. _ on details of the decay @xmath92 , is used .",
    "this is of no surprise because the polarimetric vector is given by the formula @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a normalization function , @xmath95 is the difference of the @xmath96 and @xmath97 four - momenta and @xmath98 is the four - momentum of the @xmath42 neutrino ( all defined in the @xmath42 rest frame ) see , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "obviously , any control on the vector @xmath95 can be advantageous .",
    "it is of interest to note that in the @xmath42 lepton rest frame , when @xmath99 is assumed , the term @xmath100 thus , to exploit this part of the polarimetric vector , we need to have some handle on the difference of the @xmath101 and @xmath97 energies in their respective @xmath4 leptons rest frames .",
    "otherwise , the effect of this part of the polarimetric vector cancels out and one is left with the part proportional to the @xmath91 ( equivalently @xmath102 ) momentum .",
    "let us now discuss a new observable which we have introduced to distinguish between the scalar and the pseudoscalar higgs boson .",
    "we advocate the observable where we ignore the part of the polarimetric vector proportional to the @xmath88 ( equivalently @xmath102 ) momentum in the @xmath42 rest frame .",
    "we rely only on the part of the vector due to the differences of the @xmath101 and @xmath97 momenta , which manifests the spin state of the @xmath103 . in the higgs boson rest frame",
    "the @xmath91 momentum represents a larger fraction of the higgs s energy than the neutrino .",
    "therefore , we abandon the reconstruction of the higgs boson rest frame and instead we use the @xmath104 rest frame which has the advantage that it is built only from directly visible decay products of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in the rest frame of the @xmath104 system",
    "we define the acoplanarity angle , @xmath107 , between the two planes spanned by the immediate decay products ( the @xmath101 and @xmath97 ) of the two @xmath91 s , see fig .  [ rho - decay - products ] .",
    "the variable @xmath107 alone does not distinguish the scalar and psuedoscalar higgs boson . to do this",
    "we must go further .",
    "the @xmath108 spin sensitivity is proportional to the energy difference of the charged and neutral pion ( in the @xmath42 rest frame ) , see formula ( [ formula ] ) .",
    "we have to separate events into two zones , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ,    @xmath111 @xmath112 where , @xmath113 + @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the @xmath116 energies in the respective @xmath51 rest frames .    in fig .  [ aco ]",
    "we plot the distribution of @xmath107 , where the left hand plot contains the events where the energy difference between the @xmath117 and @xmath97 defined in the @xmath118 rest frame is of the same sign as the energy difference of @xmath119 and @xmath97 defined in @xmath120 rest frame ( selection @xmath121 ) .",
    "the right hand plot contains the events with the opposite signs for the two energy differences ( selection @xmath122 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the differences between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs boson are large .",
    "if the energy difference cut was not applied , we would have completely lost sensitivity to the higgs boson parity .",
    "unfortunately , since the @xmath42-lepton is not measurable , such a selection cut can not be used directly .",
    "we reconstruct the @xmath42 lepton rest frames , and we assume gaussian spreads of the ` measured ' quantities with respect to the generated ones . for charged pion momentum we assume a @xmath123 spread on its energy and direction . for neutral pion momentum we assume an energy spread of @xmath124}$ ] . for the @xmath125 and @xmath126 angular spread we assume @xmath127 .",
    "these neutral pion resolutions can be achieved with a 15% energy error and a 2@xmath73/1800 direction error in the gammas resulting from the @xmath97 decays .",
    "these resolutions have been approximately verified with a simdet  @xcite , a parametric monte carlo program for a tesla detector  @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the method of reconstruction of replacement @xmath4 lepton rest frames was proposed .",
    "we will use this method here as well .",
    "we boost the @xmath128 momenta to the respective replacement @xmath4 lepton rest frames .",
    "the @xmath62 energies defined this way are used in the @xmath129 and @xmath130 energy difference cuts .",
    "when we use the selection cuts @xmath129 and @xmath130 and the replacement @xmath4 rest frames as well as smearing the @xmath62 momenta , we obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "[ acosm2 ] .",
    "we see that the effects to be measured diminish but remain clearly visible .",
    "we have studied the possibility of distinguishing a scalar from a pseudoscalar couplings of light higgs boson to fermions using its decay to a pair of @xmath0 leptons and their subsequent decays to @xmath81 and @xmath131 ; @xmath132 .    the beamstrahlung effect in reconstruction of the higgs boson four - momentum",
    "degraded the method of measuring the higgs boson parity using the decay chain @xmath80 , @xmath81 in a decisive way .",
    "therefore , there is little hope for the elegant method to check higgs boson parity using its decay to @xmath59 , whatever the luminosity of the future linear collider is assumed .    for @xmath131 decay",
    ", we have discussed an observable which is very promising . using reasonable assumptions about the @xmath11 production cross section and about the measurement resolutions we find that with @xmath10 @xmath133 of luminosity at a @xmath10 @xmath8 @xmath13 linear collider the @xmath1 of a @xmath7 @xmath8 higgs boson can be measured to a confidence level greater than @xmath134 .",
    "we emphasize that the technique is both model independent and independent of the higgs boson production mechanism and depends only on good measurements of the higgs boson decay products .",
    "thus , this method may be applicable to other production modes including those available at proton colliders as well as at electron colliders .",
