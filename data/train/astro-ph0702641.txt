    "in the past year there has been remarkable progress made in the field of numerical relativity ( nr ) .",
    "one of the most exciting new results is the calculation of the linear momentum flux generated by the inspiral , merger , and ringdown of black hole ( bh ) binaries @xcite .",
    "since the majority of this momentum flux is emitted during the merger and ringdown , it is difficult to make definitive predictions for the recoil using _ only _ analytic methods .",
    "however , in the non - spinning case , the post - newtonian ( pn ) model  @xcite has provided results consistent with nr all along the adiabatic inspiral ; the effective - one - body ( eob ) model can reproduce the total recoil , i.e. , also the contribution from the ring - down phase , but with large uncertainties  @xcite ; perturbative models  @xcite have also spanned the nr predictions . the recoil remains an ideal problem for which one can benefit enormously from accurate numerical simulations .",
    "recent nr results predicting very large recoil velocities @xmath7 have also called attention to the potential astrophysical importance of the recoil @xcite . for many models of dark matter halo growth through hierarchical mergers , supermassive bhs at the centers of such halos will inevitably also merge unless kicked out of the gravitational potential well from a previous merger @xcite .",
    "the nr results have shown that this is indeed _ possible _ , but have not yet shown whether it is _ probable _ or not .    as an initial investigation of this question , we have applied the eob approach @xcite to model the bh inspiral and ringdown phases including spin - orbit and spin - spin effects @xcite , described below in   2 . unlike previous analytic approaches",
    ", we can now benefit from a rapidly growing collection of numerical data , allowing us to calibrate our model and quantify its uncertainties . in   3 , we compare a large number of these nr simulations to our eob predictions , agreeing within our conservative error estimates .",
    "having established a range of confidence in the eob model , we proceed in   4 to show the results of monte carlo simulations with a wide range of mass ratios , spin magnitudes , and orientations .",
    "we thus provide the first estimates of the distribution of recoil velocities from bh mergers , and in   5 briefly discuss the astrophysical implications of these results .",
    "for the two - body dynamics , we use the eob model with spin - orbit and spin - spin terms included through 1.5pn and 2pn order , respectively , as described in @xcite . the non - spinning ,",
    "conservative dynamics are computed through 3pn order @xcite and the radiation - reaction effects are included through 3.5pn order @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions are taken to replicate an adiabatic , quasi - circular inspiral beginning at @xmath8 .",
    "building on previous works @xcite , @xcite were able to match the eob inspiral - plunge waveform to a linear combination of three kerr quasi - normal ringdown ( rd ) modes , obtaining qualitative agreement with the full nr inspiral - merger - rd wave . in the model used here",
    ", we assume the final bh spin is given by the linear scaling with mass ratio of @xcite . after calculating the inspiral and rd dynamics",
    ", we determine the linear momentum flux using the radiative multipole moments described in @xcite , including the leading - order radial velocity and spin - orbit contributions to the individual modes @xcite .",
    "these methods will be described in greater detail in a companion paper .",
    "the instantaneous transition from inspiral to ringdown turns out to be rather sensitive to the point of matching and it is only partially effective : the gravitational wave ( gw ) frequency resulting from the eob matching grows too quickly during the merger - rd transition , whereas the nr gw frequency increases more gently . as a way of estimating the optimal match point as well as the errors associated with this `` prompt merger '' approximation , we calculate the gw energy emitted in the inspiral relative to that of the ringdown .",
    "since the amplitudes of the individual multipole modes typically increase rapidly with frequency during the inspiral , by matching to the ringdown at a later time , the amplitudes of the excited rd modes and thus the rd energy increases significantly .",
    "similarly , if we match too early , the resulting rd amplitudes are too small . following @xcite , we scale the rd energy according to @xmath9 ( we define @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ) and scale the inspiral energy to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the specific energy of a test particle at the inner - most stable circular orbit ( determined here via the effective spin of the eob model ) . guided by nr results , we set @xmath16 in the equal - mass case @xcite , and use the scaling relations to determine the `` target '' inspiral and rd fractions for other bh mass ratios and spins .",
    "we then vary the matching point in time , calculating the recoil for each case , and requiring the fraction @xmath17 to agree with the target fraction within @xmath18 .",
    "this typically corresponds to a range of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the matching point . for our eob",
    "recoil predictions , we take the mean kick velocity over the acceptable match range and define 1-@xmath21 errors from the variance over this range . by calibrating with the nr results and quantifying its uncertainties , the current eob model can already be used to obtain interesting predictions of the recoil velocity .",
    "unlike previous analytic calculations of the recoil , we are now in the unique position of being able to compare our eob predictions directly with a growing collection of high - resolution nr simulations and thereby establish a range of confidence in the results of our analytic model . beginning with the simplest case , in figure [ plotone ] we show in the top panel the eob recoil velocities for non - spinning unequal - mass binaries ( diamond symbols with 1-@xmath21 error bars ) , along with the classic formula of @xcite : @xmath22 , scaled to the results of @xcite who find @xmath23 km / s . in the bottom panel",
    ", we show the results of equal - mass binaries with equal - magnitude spins aligned and anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the solid line is the linear scaling @xmath24 km / s given by @xcite , where we define the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath25 .",
    "+    in figure [ plottwo ] we show the combination of the unequal - mass and anti - aligned spin effects , with both black holes having equal dimensionless spin magnitudes @xmath26 .",
    "following the approach of @xcite , we plot analytic fits to the eob predictions of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we agree closely with their best - fit results , matching @xmath30 km / s , and finding slightly higher values of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( compare to their @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "this deviation is largest for large spins , where they do not have much data and our simplified rd matching methods might start to break down . following the spin - orbit recoil formula in @xcite , we can modify equation ( [ v_goddard ] ) to include non - planar kicks .",
    "we write the recoil component in the plane as @xmath35 and the component out of the plane as @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the angle between the spin and angular momentum and @xmath38 the azimuthal angle of each spin , measured with respect to the binary separation vector . from the monte carlo simulations ( described in the next section ) , we find @xmath39 , but with a large scatter between the eob predictions and the simple analytic model .",
    "+    as a final check of our model , in table [ tableone ] we compare with the more general configurations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for the configuration of @xcite , where the spins are anti - aligned with each other and normal to the angular momentum vector ,",
    "the value of the final recoil is sensitive to the angle the spins make with the orbital velocity vector .",
    "we maximize over this angle , but are still unable to attain their kick magnitudes of @xmath40 km / s . however , we see from these different cases that there does nt seem to be a",
    "_ systematic _ disagreement with the nr results : sometimes the eob overestimates the kick , and sometimes underestimates it , so the velocity distributions integrated over a wide range of bh parameter space should still be reasonably reliable .",
    ".[tableone ] comparison of nr recoil calculations with eob model [ cols=\"^,<,<,^,^,>,>,^ \" , ]      + * references : * [ 1 ] @xcite [ 2 ] @xcite [ 3 ] @xcite",
    "having successfully compared the eob model with a range of nr results , we are now in a position to carry out a series of monte carlo calculations .",
    "the first model we consider is that of equal - mass bhs with random spins , uniformly distributed in @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "we construct a probability distribution function @xmath43 for the kick velocities by summing over a collection of normal distributions with the mean and variance for each individual binary system calculated as in   [ analytic_models ] . the cumulative distribution function @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 , normalized such that @xmath46 and @xmath44 is the probability that a random binary in the sample will have a recoil larger than @xmath47 .",
    "+    figure [ plotthree ] shows this distribution for the equal - mass , random spin case for @xmath48 binaries , with the dashed lines corresponding to 1-@xmath21 confidence limits .",
    "the resulting uncertainty is on the order of @xmath49 , which , while admittedly large , can still provide interesting new constraints on astrophysical models of black hole mergers .",
    "perhaps a more realistic model samples a uniform distribution in mass ratios @xmath50 $ ] and spin orientations , and set @xmath51 for each black hole , based on observational arguments that most supermassive black holes are rapidly spinning @xcite . for these parameters ,",
    "we find a fraction @xmath2 of binaries have recoil velocities greater than 500 km / s and @xmath3 have kicks greater than 1000 km / s .",
    "however , as we saw in   [ compare_nr ]",
    ", the largest kicks occur with nearly equal masses , so these fractions may be biased towards smaller kicks due to the wide range of @xmath52 considered in this model . to factor out the uncertainty in mass distributions , we plot in figure [ plotfour ] the velocity distribution function as a function of @xmath53 . as expected , the typical velocities increas significantly for @xmath54 . limiting the sample to this range of masses , we find @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "+    it is quite possible that black holes in the early universe have actually gained most of their mass by mergers as opposed to accretion , and thus may not be rapidly spinning @xcite . to explore this possibility",
    ", we performed another calculation with the same range of mass ratios and equal spin magnitudes @xmath55 , uniformly distributed over @xmath56 $ ] , again with random orientations . after calculating the resulting distribution function @xmath57",
    ", we define the functions @xmath58 as the velocity below which @xmath49 of the predicted kicks lie .",
    "similarly , @xmath59 is greater than @xmath60 of the kick velocities for a given @xmath53 and @xmath26 .",
    "contours of these functions are shown in figure [ plotfive ] .",
    "as expected , we see that systems with large spins and nearly equal masses have the highest kicks .",
    "+    we found by inspection that the distribution function @xmath57 can be well approximated for @xmath61 km / s by @xmath62.\\ ] ] again motivated by maximizing the phenomenological equation ( [ v_goddard ] ) , we found a relatively good analytic fit @xmath63 with @xmath64 km / s and @xmath65 , matching the eob prediction of @xmath66 within @xmath67 over the entire range of @xmath68 investigated , and within @xmath69 for the great majority of it . as a check of this method",
    ", we applied it to the other monte carlo samples described above and along with equation ( [ f_v90 ] ) are able to match closely the integrated distribution functions @xmath44 for @xmath70 km / s .",
    "along with the recent nr calculations of recoil velocities , there has been a great deal of discussion of the astrophysical consequences of these kicks . here",
    "we only give a brief summary of these results . for a more detailed review , see @xcite , and references therein .",
    "of particular interest to our calculation is the observational evidence that most of the supermassive bhs in the low-@xmath71 universe are rapidly spinning @xcite , and may have undergone multiple mergers with @xmath72 @xcite , and thus have quite possibly received kicks on the order of 500 or even 1000 km / s",
    ". this should be enough to eject the final bh from spiral galaxy bulges and even most giant elliptical galaxies @xcite [ globular clusters may favor more extreme mass ratios , but also have significantly smaller escape velocities @xcite ] . at the same time , there is some observational evidence _ against _ such large kicks @xcite . this apparent discrepancy may be explained with more detailed models for the bh mass distributions in hierarchical merger scenarios , as well as the possibility of using certain preferred spin orientations that would reduce the kick magnitude @xcite . at the same time , to reduce the uncertainties in our predictions , we plan to improve the eob model , notably the details of the matching method and the determination of the rd frequencies ."
