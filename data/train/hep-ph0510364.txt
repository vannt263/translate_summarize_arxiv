    "high - energy nucleus - nucleus collision experiments are mainly designed for the search and investigation of the predicted new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in which quarks and gluons would be set free from the color confinement observed in normal nuclear matter .",
    "moreover , heavy - ion reactions are expected to exhibit other phenomena of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the hot and dense environment of the collision region , like in - medium modifications of almost all hadrons , or the state of color superconductivity ( csc ) . in this respect ,",
    "the nucleus - nucleus collision experiments provide a unique way to test the validity of present theoretical approaches and models of physics of strongly interacting matter .    on the other side ,",
    "a characteristic and inevitable problem of collision experiments is that in - medium modifications of hadrons and the expected new states of matter ( e.g. qgp , csc ) disappear by the end of the reaction .",
    "accordingly , one can not directly measure these properties of the produced hot and dense medium .",
    "instead , one has to probe the initial stages of the collision indirectly by using theoretical models to reproduce the observed final particle spectra .",
    "a detailed understanding of the different stages of a relativistic heavy - ion collision process becomes therefore very compelling .",
    "the scheme of a representative relativistic heavy - ion collision process looks as follows :    in the very early stage of nucleus - nucleus collisions , an extremely hot and dense medium is created in which several hundred or even thousands of secondary partons are produced . due to the high partonic density , local ( perhaps global ) thermal equilibrium",
    "is reached very rapidly , for instance , at rhic or lhc incident energies within @xmath0 fm / c for gluons , and @xmath1 fm / c for quarks @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that since the heavy quark flavor production is dominated by the relatively slow gluon - gluon fusion , chemical equilibration of the heavy quark flavors ( strangeness , charm etc . )",
    "might stay incomplete during all the collision evolution , so that there is a need to implement a strangeness suppression factor @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , chemical equilibration of gluons and light quark flavors is believed to be reached around @xmath3 fm / c  @xcite .    in spite of the nature of the produced medium",
    ", large pressure gradient perpendicular to the collision axes drives the system into rapid expansion and to cool down . in heavy - ion collisions , below the critical temperature @xmath4 mev several hundred of hadrons emerge forming a strongly interacting resonance gas .",
    "as the fireball cools down further , below the chemical freeze out temperature @xmath5 , inelastic collisions cease and hadronic abundances become fixed .",
    "this process is usually called the chemical freeze out ( cfo ) . later on ,",
    "when the hadron gas becomes more dilute , below the thermal freeze out temperature @xmath6 , the elastic interactions cease as well .",
    "this stage of the collision is usually called kinetic freeze out ( kfo ) .",
    "finally , the formed hadrons of the thermal freeze out spectrum propagate freely toward the detectors . recently , in @xcite both the chemical freeze out temperature @xmath5 and thermal freeze out temperature @xmath6 have been determined for several collision scenarios and baryon densities .",
    "nonetheless , the sharp distinction between chemical and thermal freeze out is an idealization , while in a real collision due to the short time scales both processes become mixed with each other .",
    "therefore , one sometimes calls it freeze out process without further specification between chemical and thermal freeze out which implies @xmath7 .",
    "many kind of approaches have been applied for the description of the freeze out of strongly interacting matter .",
    "statistical models  @xcite can reproduce well the measured particle multiplicities in most of the collision experiments done so far",
    ". kinetic models  @xcite as well as hydrodynamical approaches  @xcite have proven to be able to describe most of the collective phenomena like the different flow components in heavy - ion reactions . however , despite the success in comparison with experiments , the in - medium modifications of the hadrons during the freeze out process have not been taken into account yet . in",
    "most of the former evaluations the vacuum parameters of the particles have been implemented . to the best of our knowledge the refs . @xcite",
    "seem to be the only investigations , where the impact of in - medium hadron masses ( mesons and baryons ) on the particle ratios during the chemical freeze out has been studied .",
    "a systematic study about the impact of in - medium hadron masses on the kinetic freeze out process has not been performed yet .",
    "but , implementing the vacuum parameters of hadrons for describing the kinetic freeze out process is an approximation which may work or may not work , depending on the physical system under consideration .",
    "for instance , both experiments  @xcite and theoretical investigations  @xcite suggest , that pions embedded in a hot and dense medium suffer only a small mass change .",
    "accordingly , the description of the freeze out process of a purely pion gas by means of their vacuum parameters seems to be a reliable approximation . on the other side ,",
    "the mass of kaons can be shifted considerably in a hot and dense medium @xcite , so that taking into account in - medium modifications for the kaon component seems to be compelling .    in this work ,",
    "we study a nucleon gas and investigate how strong the impact of an in - medium mass shift of nucleons on the freeze out profile is .",
    "we compare the obtained results with calculations using a vacuum nucleon mass .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the freeze out process within a finite time - like layer is considered in sec .",
    "2 . the nucleon mass shift and it s implementation into the freeze out process",
    "are outlined in sec .",
    "the results of our study are presented in sec .",
    "4 . finally , in sec . 5",
    "a summary and outlook are given .",
    "further notations and a brief mathematical remark can be found in the appendix .",
    "in this section we are focussing on the last stage of the collision , the freeze out process , i.e. we start our investigation from the time of collision where the expanding and cooling down system reaches a temperature @xmath8 , where the hadronization of the primary parton gas is almost completed .",
    "the frozen out particles are formed in a layer of finite thickness @xmath9 , bounded by two hyper - surfaces : the pre - freeze out hyper - surface with @xmath10 and a post - freeze out hyper - surface with @xmath11 .",
    "these surfaces are defined by the normal @xmath12 , which in general can be a space - like @xmath13 or time - like four vector , @xmath14 .",
    "the diameter @xmath9 of the layer is of the order of a few mean free paths of the particle under consideration .",
    "to get an idea about the scales we recall that for nucleons at ground state saturation density the mean free path is about @xmath15 fm @xcite .",
    "dynamical models , like hydrodynamical or transport models , allow to describe such freeze out processes through the layer .",
    "in doing so , the hydrodynamical models have certain advantages over transport model calculations .",
    "an important one is that , once the equation of state and initial conditions of the hadronic matter are specified , the space - time evolution of the system is uniquely determined by the hydrodynamic differential equations .",
    "especially , this implies that the impact of several equation of state may be investigated in a very direct way .",
    "even more , uncertainties or assumptions made in the underlying kinetic theory of the particles under consideration are circumvented .",
    "in addition , the use of familiar thermodynamical concepts , like temperature , flow velocity , pressure and energy density also provide a transparent physical picture of the evolution .",
    "of course , the basis of applicability of hydrodynamics is the assumption of local thermal and chemical equilibrium . in the following",
    "we will suppose the validity of these conditions and will apply the theory of hydrodynamics for describing the thermal freeze out process in a finite space - time layer .",
    "the theoretical description of the kinetic freeze out within a hydrodynamical approach has been worked out some years ago @xcite .",
    "very recently , in @xcite and @xcite the formalism has been applied to the case of a finite freeze out layer , separately both for space - like and time - like normals .",
    "while the formalism in @xcite has been developed for the general case of a massive particle , the calculations have been performed for a massless pion gas . here",
    ", we will make use of the outlined formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite for a time - like layer for the case of a massive nucleon .",
    "in particular , we will implement the in - medium mass modification of nucleons traveling through the freeze out layer .",
    "it is not necessary to repeat the formalism of @xcite in detail .",
    "instead , we shall restrict our explanations on the basic concept and will only give the equations relevant for our study .",
    "local equilibrium implies that the thermodynamical parameters inside the layer become space - time dependent , i.e. we have a space - time dependent temperature @xmath16 , flow velocity @xmath17 , energy density @xmath18 and nucleon density @xmath19 . for evaluating these functions",
    "we need the basic equations of hydrodynamics , _",

    "t^ ( x ) = 0 , [ hydro_5 ] where n^ ( x ) = k^ f(x , k ) [ hydro_15 ] is the particle current , and t^ ( x ) = k^ k^ f(x , k ) [ hydro_10 ] is the energy momentum tensor . here , @xmath20 is the four - coordinate and @xmath21 is the four - momentum of the nucleon . while the first relation in ( [ hydro_5 ] ) is only valid when the total number of particles is conserved , the second relation in ( [ hydro_5 ] ) is always satisfied and asserts the energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the one - particle distribution function @xmath22 is an invariant lorentz scalar , and is normalized to the invariant number of particles @xmath23 ( in our case the nucleons ) , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "while the components of the tensors ( [ hydro_15 ] ) and ( [ hydro_10 ] ) depend on the lorentz frame chosen , two lorentz invariant scalars can be obtained , the invariant scalar energy density @xmath25 and invariant scalar particle density @xmath26 : e ( x ) & = & u _ ( x ) t^ ( x ) u _ ( x ) , [ hydro_20 ] +   +",

    "we notice that these invariant scalars have to be distinguished from the non - invariant energy density @xmath27 and particle density @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the non - invariant total energy and @xmath30 is the non - invariant volume of the system .    while the invariant relations ( [ hydro_20 ] ) and ( [ hydro_25 ] ) are valid in any lorentz frame , in a concrete evaluation one has to specify the frame in which the components of the four - current , energy - momentum tensor and the ( always time - like ) four - velocity @xmath31 are evaluated .",
    "any lorentz frame can be defined by a lorentz boost in respect to the local rest frame of the nucleon gas , rfg , on which the condition @xmath32 is imposed ; obviously , in rfg we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , this condition does not define the rfg uniquely .",
    "there are , in general , several possibilities to define such a rest frame . here , we will take eckart s definition @xcite , which is the most appropriate one for heavy - ion reactions with high baryon densities . according to this definition the local rest frame",
    "is tied to conserved particles , which can be achieved by equating the unit vector of the particle four - current with the four - velocity of the particle flow , u^ ( x ) & = & .",
    "[ hydro_30 ] accordingly , in rfg there is no particle flow in spatial directions .",
    "it is straightforward to recognize , that the lorentz invariant denominator in ( [ hydro_30 ] ) is just the invariant scalar particle density of eq .",
    "( [ hydro_25 ] ) . and ,",
    "while the components of four - vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on the lorentz frame chosen , the tensor relation ( [ hydro_30 ] ) , which connects these frame - dependent components , remains valid in any frame .    from the definitions ( [ hydro_20 ] ) , ( [ hydro_25 ] ) and ( [ hydro_30 ] ) one obtains the following set of three coupled differential equations , which , by means of eckart s definition , are valid in any lorentz frame : d e ( x ) & = & u _ ( x ) d t^ ( x ) u _ ( x ) + & & + 2 d u _ ( x ) t^ ( x ) u _ , [ hydro_35 ] +   + d",

[ hydro_45 ] altogether , since there are four unknowns in the problem under consideration , namely @xmath37 , an additional constraint is necessary to get a complete system of equations , which uniquely determines these four unknowns .",
    "that constraint is provided by the equation of state ( eos ) for the nucleon gas @xcite , which is assumed to be valid in any space - time point of the reaction zone after hadronization , e ( x ) & = & n ( x ) .",
    "[ eos_5 ] the term @xmath38 mev accounts for the nuclear binding energy among the nucleons , the term proportional to the compressibility constant @xmath39 mev accounts for the dependence of compressibility on density .",

    "there are other generalizations for the nucleonic eos @xcite .",
    "however , we have checked that in the energy and temperature region we are working here , the results obtained are insensitive on the specific choice of nucleonic eos .",
    "the eos ( [ eos_5 ] ) is used to determine the temperature @xmath41 of the interacting component of the nucleon gas during the freeze out process .",
    "accordingly , the four equations ( [ hydro_35 ] ) , ( [ hydro_40 ] ) , ( [ hydro_45 ] ) and ( [ eos_5 ] ) represent a closed set for evaluating the four unknowns @xmath37 of the one - particle system .",
    "now we will turn to the explicit evaluation of components for the energy - momentum tensor and nucleon four - current .",
    "in line with ref . @xcite we will perform all evaluations in the lorentz rest frame of the freeze out front , rff , so that in our study all tensor components in eqs .",
    "( [ hydro_35 ] ) - ( [ hydro_45 ] ) can be labeled by rff .",
    "the lorentz frame rff is defined as follows :    at a given instant in the space - time the expanding hot and dense hadronic system reaches a certain freeze out temperature @xmath42 , where all constituents of the system are assumed to get frozen out , i.e. all hadrons do not interact anymore . in an arbitrary but fixed direction",
    "@xmath43 transverse to the beam the rest frame of the gas rfg moves with a velocity @xmath44 relative to the freeze out front rff",

    "accordingly , the thermal freeze out process inside the layer can be described by decomposing the particle distribution function into two components of the matter , an interacting part @xmath47 and a non - interacting free part @xmath48 , thus f ( x , k ) & = & f_i ( x , k ) + f_f ( x , k ) .",

    "we assume to have thermal equilibrium , i.e. we have a jttner distribution for @xmath47 as starting one - particle distribution function , while by definition @xmath48 is zero on the pre - freeze out hyper - surface .",

    "accordingly , the last term in ( [ hydro_35 ] ) vanishes , as it can be seen as follows . since at the beginning of a time step we take a jttner distribution according to the immediate re - thermalization limit , the second term of ( [ hydro_35 ] ) is zero ( see appendix ) .",

    "first , the formulas ( [ massshift_4 ] ) and ( [ massshift_5 ] ) have , like other theoretical approaches , a limited range of validity in respect to the density ; @xmath132 . and second , according to eq .",
    "( [ kinetic_10 ] ) the re - thermalization is assumed within a time step @xmath133 .",
    "numerical accuracy for solving the set of differential equations ( [ hydro_35 ] ) - ( [ hydro_45 ] ) requires sufficiently small time intervalls @xmath133 .",
    "however , a smaller starting temperature @xmath112 implies a longer re - thermalization time @xmath134 , so that @xmath112 can not be taken arbitrary small .",
    "in addition , these two boundaries have to be adjusted to be in a region of the qcd phase diagram where we are inside the hadronization region and above the kinetic freeze out .",
    "the parameter choice of the starting values , @xmath135 , @xmath109 mev , are an optimal compromise for these borderlines . within the approach",
    "presented we have a common way to model the kinetic freeze out process , and which is capable to implement the nucleon mass shift by means of a purely nucleon gas model . nevertheless , one has also to be aware that the pion - nucleon ratio becomes small only for high enough nucleon densities @xmath136 and moderate temperatures @xmath137 mev , e.g. @xcite .",
    "our starting values for density and temperature on the pre freeze out hypersurface deviate from these values .",
    "therefore , a more sophisticated model requires the implementation of pions and maybe even heavier mesons .",
    "however , due to different freeze out scenarios between nucleons and mesons , cf .",
    "@xcite , such a procedure would require the use of a two - fluid or even three - fluid model , which is a highly involved tool , cf .",
    "therefore , for the time being it is difficult to say how strong the impact of mesons is .",
    "therefore , we were aiming at a description , which allows to account for the nucleon mass shift scenario during the freeze out process in a more common way .",
    "finally , we remark that in - medium modifications have actually to be taken into account already before and during the hadronization process .",
    "this points to an even stronger impact of in - medium modifications on the final particle spectrum than presented .     over their transversal and longitudinal momenta @xmath129 and @xmath130 ,",

    "special attention has been drawn about how strong the impact of the in - medium nucleon mass modification on the thermal freeze out process is . by focussing on a purely nucleon gas",
    "we have found a substantial effect on the thermodynamical quantities like temperature @xmath97 , flow velocity @xmath124 , particle density @xmath26 and energy density @xmath25 of the interacting component .",
    "all of these thermodynamical functions have revealed a faster freeze out compared to a scenario without in - medium nucleon mass shift .",
    "these modifications have a sizable implication on the freeze out particle distribution function , which is a basic observable in heavy - ion collision experiments . for small momenta around the nucleon mass a strong change of about a factor @xmath120 has been found ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : distr ] ) .",
    "a contour plot of the particle distribution function in the transversal - longitudinal momentum plane @xmath140 illustrates this effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_4 ] ) . from these results",
    "we conclude that in - medium modifications of nucleons have a significant consequence on the freeze out process .",
    "this reasoning is certainly valid for heavy - ion collisions , which produce sufficiently high nucleon particle densities ; in particular for experiments like compressed baryonic matter ( cbm collaboration ) planned at the gsi facility in darmstadt / germany .    for a more realistic description of heavy ion collisions one should include in the analysis at least the low laying mesons and baryons as well .",
    "all hadrons suffer in - medium modifications of their masses and widths , but there are strong differences among them .",
    "for instance , while the pion mass remains almost unaffected by the hadronic medium even at very high temperatures and densities , this is not the case for nucleons , kaons and delta resonances . taking into account the pions and",
    "the in - medium modifications of other hadrons in the fireball produced in nucleus - nucleus reactions could modify our results in the details , but not the general statement that in - medium modifications have some relevance for the freeze out process .",
    "for example , the implementation of the pions leads to a stronger temperature dependence of the chiral condensate @xcite , which causes a stronger down shift of the nucleon mass with increasing temperature .",
    "then , our results might even be more pronounced .",
    "in addition , the implementation of in - medium modifications has to be taken into account before and during the hadronization , which leads also to an amplification of their impact on the whole freeze out process .    in summary ,",
    "our findings for a purely nucleon gas suggest that taking into account in - medium modifications of nucleons seems to be a necessary and interesting phenomenon , in particular for collision scenarios with high baryonic densities .",
