    "the peak at low energies ( with maximum at ir - x - ray frequencies , depending on the source ) is due to synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons .",
    "the second component ( peaking at mev - gev energies ) is widely attributed to inverse compton ( ic ) emission by the same electron population . for bl lac objects",
    ", the majority of blazars detected at tev energies , characterized by the extreme weakness of emission lines in the optical spectra , is popularly assumed that the target soft photons for the ic scattering are the synchrotron photons themselves ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc , e.g. tavecchio et al .",

    "2003 ) or as their direct synchrotron emission ( aharonian 2000 ) .",
    "the necessity to accelerate protons at very high energies , together with the relatively low efficiency of the photo - meson and synchrotron proton emission ( e.g. , sikora 2011 ) , generally implies magnetic fields and jet powers larger than those inferred in leptonic models ( bttcher et al .",

    "2007a , albert et al .",
    "2007 , aleksic et al . 2011 ) , seems difficult to be reconciled with the inefficient cooling provided by hadronic interactions .",
    "a possible hadronic origin of the @xmath1ray component has been recently considered for a small peculiar group of tev emitting blazars , the so - called extreme high - energy peaked bl lacs ( ehbl , costamante et al .",
    "the tev spectrum of these sources ( up to @xmath6 tev ) , if corrected for the expected substantial depletion of high - energy photons caused by the interaction with the ir - optical extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , is exceptionally hard ( aharonian et al .",
    "furthermore , in evident contrast with the rest of the blazar population , the vhe emission seems to be stable on timescales of @xmath7months - years , although there is room for small - amplitude variability , very difficult to detect because of the very low flux ( e.g. cerruti et al . 2013 ) .",
    "these features make very difficult to interpret the sed in the framework of the standard ssc model , in particular because the reduction of the klein - nishina scattering cross - section necessarily entails soft spectra above 1 tev .",
    "proposed solutions to this problem involve very high values of the minimum lorentz factor of the emitting electron ( katarzyski et al .",

    "( 2012 ) assumed that the maximum energy of uhe protons can barely reach @xmath8 ev .",

    "the observed tev spectrum ( red symbols ) is soft : however , if the correction for absorption through the interaction with ebl is applied , very hard spectra ( gray points ) are derived .",
    "for the simple one - zone leptonic model , robust general constraints to the physical parameters of the blazar emission region can be derived ( tmg98 ) . in turn , the inferred parameters can be used to calculate the relevant quantities for the uhecr scenario , the maximum energy of the accelerated particles ( using the so - called hillas criterion ) and the jet power . in this section",

    "classical \" bl lac detected at tev energies show softer x - ray spectra , locating the synchrotron peak in the uv - soft x - ray band .",
    "moreover , the gev emission of classical bl lacs is much more powerful than that of ehbl , implying a lower synchrotron / ic luminosity ratio . for these reasons",
    ", the application of the parameters estimated for jets of classical bl lacs to ehbl could be not appropriate .",
    "the assumption at the base of our procedure is that the intrinsic ( ebl - absorbed ) ssc emission of the jet does not substantially contribute to the observed high - energy component ( which is instead the result of the hadronic cascade ) .",
    "the constraints derived under this assumption will not be limited to a specific ( leptonic ) emission framework .",
    "indeed , the relativistic electrons emitting the synchrotron radiation will inevitably emit ssc radiation , making our constraints meaningful even if there are other ( i.e. ic emission with external photon fields , hadronic ) contributions to the @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "since these other contribution would imply larger magnetic fields and jet power , the values derived here could be considered as robust _",
    "lower limits _ for these quantities .",
    "it is also worth noting that even if the uhecr acceleration occurs in regions different from that in which the observed synchrotron radiation is produced , the constraints to the jet power ( though not those for @xmath12 ) remains valid as long as the jet is assumed stationary .",

    "besides the analytic estimates above , approximated but suitable to give an immediate glance of the parameter space , we also applied the one zone leptonic model fully described in maraschi & tavecchio ( 2003 ) to reproduce the sed of the four ehbl . since the shape and the position of the ssc peak is basically unconstrained ( the only constraint being the upper limit to the luminosity ) , these models are only intended as an example and a consistency check of the previous treatment .",

    "the uhecr beam is quite high for low doppler factors ( @xmath133 ) . since in this case",
    "the jet power is dominated by the magnetic field component ( see tab .",
    "2 ) , one could argue that the uhecr energization involves some magnetic dissipation processes , such as magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , giannios 2010 ) . for larger bulk lorentz factors the required cr efficiency rapidly decreases due to the narrower beaming cone .",
    "we have assumed that the intrinsic ssc emission flux is @xmath134 5 - 10 times lower than the hadronic cascade reprocessed flux , so that the contribution of the jet emission is almost negligible .",
    "the marginal evidence of mild ( less than a factor of 2 in about one month ) variability of the tev flux of 1es 0229 + 200 , recently reported by veritas ( cerruti et al .",
    "2013 ) , seems to indicate that the ssc intrinsic flux is not much smaller than what assumed here .",
    "in fact , in the framework of the hadronic cascade scenario , a quasi steady emission is expected : in the case of filaments , the time spread is expected to be of the order of @xmath135 yr ( murase et al .",
    "2012 , see also prosekin et al .",
    "2012 ) , thus much longer than what observed .",
    "the only explanation for variability is therefore to assume a variable underlying ssc component , whose level is likely not much lower than what assumed in this work .",
    "note that larger ssc luminosity would imply lower values of @xmath12 and thus larger cr luminosities .    finally , it is tempting to speculate about the possibility that a local ( i.e. within the gzk radius , @xmath136 mpc ) population of misaligned ehbl contributes to the uhecr flux observed at the earth ( see kotera & olinto 2011 for a review ) .",
    "let us consider first a local population of ehbl characterized by _",
    "steady _ emission .",
    "the density of sources required to account for the observed injected luminosity per unit volume , @xmath137 erg mpc@xmath138 yr@xmath5 is @xmath139 mpc@xmath138 ( we used @xmath66 erg s@xmath5 and the factor 2 accounts for the existence of 2 jets ) .",

    "alternatively , one can consider sources characterized by activity periods of _ finite duration _ @xmath142 . in case of substantial deflection ( @xmath143 ) of the injected uhecr by a magnetized structure with spatial scale @xmath144 ,",
    "the time spread of uhecr is of the order of @xmath145 ( e.g. murase & takami 2009 ) .",
    "if the activity duration is @xmath146 , the flux would be diluted .",
    "given sources of uhecr with intrinsic luminosity @xmath147 and density @xmath148 , the measured luminosity per unit volume @xmath149 would therefore be @xmath150 , from which the duration time of a single injection event would be @xmath151 yr .",
    "this time is much smaller than the deflection time @xmath152 yr , consistently with the assumption above .",
    "importantly , the required @xmath142 is also compatible with the minimum time of activity of ehbl requested in order to not increase the uhecr power in the hadronic cascade scenario .",
    "in fact , the expected times spread induced by the deviation in the egmf ( filaments ) is @xmath153 yr , which is of the order of ( or smaller than ) @xmath142 for @xmath154 ev , @xmath155 and @xmath156 compatible with the lower limits .",
    "since there are no ehbl within the gzk radius , local ehbl must be misaligned and thus the scenario above can be applied only if cr suffer significant deviation by the egmf . at a first glance",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the request that the uhecr beams of ehbl are not significantly deflected .",
    "a possibility to reconcile these two conditions is that , for some reasons , the environment of local ehbl is different than that of more distant sources .",
    "however , a more intriguing possibility is based on the observed change of composition of uhecr with energy , from protons to heavier ions ( iron ) , occurring around @xmath157 ev",

    "although this result , involving extrapolations of hadronic interaction parameters at energies unaccessible in laboratory ( e.g. kotera & olinto 2011 ) , should be better understood , we note that if both protons and iron nuclei are accelerated by ehbl jets , a transition around @xmath158 ev is expected in the scenario depicted above .",
    "in fact below these energies , both protons and iron nuclei are expected to be significantly deflected by the @xmath6 ng magnetic field of filaments . above @xmath8 , however , the deflection for protons becomes negligible , while the heavier iron nuclei are still isotropized .",
    "the change in composition would therefore reflect the different deflection suffered by proton and iron in the egmf magnetic field .    concerning the misaligned counterparts , we note that ehbl are characterized by a very small radio luminosity , @xmath159 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "considering that this emission could be , at least partly , beamed , we can conclude that the local parent population belongs to the low - power tail of the weak ( fr i ) radiogalaxies , a ( probably large ) population of sources still not well studied ( baldi & capetti 2009 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results are consistent  in terms of maximum uhecr energy and sustainable luminosity  with the assumptions of the hadronic cascade scenario for the @xmath1-ray emission of ehbl if these sources do not reside in clusters and thus their uhe proton beams are not too much deflected by magnetic fields .",
    "the parameters are also consistent with the idea that a population of local ehbl can contribute to the uhecr flux measured at the earth .    as argued by murase et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and takami et al .",
    "( 2013 ) a strong test of the model would be the detection of photons with energy above @xmath134 20 tev from ehbl .",
    "in fact , due to the absorption by ebl , an intrinsic @xmath1-ray emission at these energies is expected to be completely suppressed , leaving as viable explanations the hadronic cascade model or the more speculative photon - axion like particle conversion scenario ( e.g. de angelis et al 2011 ) .",
    "future observations with cta ( actis et al . 2011 ) , or even with the planned astri mini - array of small size telescopes ( di pierro et al . 2013 , vercellone et al .",
