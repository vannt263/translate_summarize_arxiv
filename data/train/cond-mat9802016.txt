    "in recent years , quantum creep of vortices in high @xmath4-superconductors has attracted considerable interest as , on the one hand , this phenomenon is responsible for the dissipation of energy and thus is relevant from a technological point of view , while , on the other hand , it represents an interesting example of a macroscopic quantum phenomenon , the theoretical study of which is challenging .",
    "a particularly well defined and technologically relevant configuration are vortices trapped by columnar defects introduced into the sample by heavy ion irradiation .",
    "measurements of the critical current density and the magnetic relaxation rate show the strong influence these pinning centers have on the vortex dynamics@xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of the depinning of a pancake vortex governed by hall dynamics from a columnar defect in a layered superconductor in the presence of a small ( @xmath6 ) transport current .",
    "the external magnetic field is chosen parallel to the @xmath7-axis of the superconductor . in the limit",
    "@xmath8 the problem is semiclassical and the euclidean action can be calculated in the whole temperature range . in the limit @xmath9",
    "the problem discussed above has been considered in ref.@xcite , however , it appears that the approximations made are too rough , leading to an inexact result for the decay rate .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to improve on the analysis of ref.@xcite and to extend the calculations to the entire temperature range .",
    "we adopt the semiclassical approach instead of the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation used in ref.@xcite . for a general review concerning the decay of metastable states",
    "see the review of hnggi , talkner , and borkovec , see ref.@xcite .",
    "the problem of quantum and classical hall creep of vortices in various geometries and for different driving forces @xmath10 and @xmath0 has been studied by various authors , see refs@xcite .",
    "the process of quantum tunneling is described by a time - dependent saddle - point solution .",
    "consequently , the calculations of the decay rate require the specification of the vortex dynamics .",
    "the different contributions to the dynamics considered traditionally are of the massive , the dissipative , and the hall type .",
    "the ( low frequency ) equation of motion of a single vortex can be written in the form @xmath11 where the dynamical forces are balanced by the lorentz and pinning forces . in conventional superconductors one can neglect the contribution of the mass and hall terms , whereas in high-@xmath4 superconductors the hall force may become relevant . in particular , it is widely believed@xcite that at low temperatures the superclean limit can be reached where the hall term is large . in this case @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the level spacing inside the vortex core and",
    "@xmath14 is the quasiparticle relaxation time .",
    "indeed , recent hall angle measurements@xcite demonstrate that the limit @xmath15 can be realized .",
    "on the other hand , the large parameter @xmath16 also gives rise to a large vortex mass .",
    "microscopic calculations show that the vortex mass is enhanced by a factor @xmath17 in comparison to the dirty limit@xcite .",
    "still , it can be shown that for frequencies @xmath18 the hall force wins over the inertial one , whereas at high temperatures @xmath19 the vortex equation of motion can not be cast into the simple form ( [ dwizhenie ] ) ( an accurate description produces dispersive transport coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) . in this situation a good starting point is to ignore the contribution of the vortex mass and solve the remaining hall tunneling problem .",
    "the advantage of this treatment lies in the fact that in the limit @xmath6 the problem allows for an analytical solution in the whole temperature range with a universal answer : the euclidean action depends only on the depth of the pinning potential , the detailed shape of the potential being irrelevant . in a second step",
    "we establish the consistency of this approximation in the physically relevant regime of parameters .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ model ] we discuss the model and the qualitative picture of the tunneling process . in section [ problem ]",
    "we calculate the euclidean action in the whole temperature range and show that the problem always exhibits a second - order like transition from quantum to classical behaviour .",
    "furthermore , we provide estimates for the preexponential factors in the various regimes .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we discuss the conditions of applicability of our results .",
