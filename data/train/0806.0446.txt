    "the suppressions of high @xmath1 hadrons and unbalanced back - to - back azimuthal correlations of the dijet events in au+au collisions measured at rhic  @xcite provide experimental evidence in support of the jet quenching .",
    "most of the calculations ( see  @xcite for a review ) considers the energy loss due to induced bremsstrahlung radiation and reproduces the observed nuclear suppression of light hadrons ( @xmath2 ) in @xmath3 collisions for centre of mass energy @xmath4 gev at rhic .",
    "the effect of collisional loss was completely ignored in most of the previous calculations .",
    "however , the non - photonic single electron spectrum from heavy meson decays measured by phenix collaboration  @xcite shows much larger suppression than expected . by considering radiative energy loss for heavy quarks",
    "the data can not be reproduced as radiation is suppressed for heavy quarks due to dead - cone effects .",
    "thus , there has been a renewed interest to revisit the importance of collisional energy loss both for light as well as heavy quarks .",
    "the partonic energy loss due to collisional processes was revisited in  @xcite and its importance was demonstrated in the context of rhic in@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to show that the omission of the collisional energy loss to explain the rhic data is not justified . to this end",
    ", we calculate the nuclear suppression factor @xmath5 for pions ( @xmath6 ) considering only the collision energy loss .",
    "in order to calculate the @xmath1 distribution of hadrons from parton fragmentation we need the phase space distribution of partons , @xmath7 . the dynamical evolution of @xmath7 is obtained by solving the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation which reads , ( -)f(*p*,t ) & & = [ p_if(*p*,t ) ] + & & + [ b_(*p*)f(*p*,t ) ] + & & + [ b_f(*p*,t ) ] , [ fpexp ] where the second term on the left hand side arises due to expansion  @xcite .",
    "bjorken hydrodynamical model  @xcite has been used here for space time evolution . in eq .",
    "( [ fpexp ] ) @xmath8 represents the distribution function of the partons under study , @xmath9 , denotes drag coefficient , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , represent diffusion constants along parallel and perpendicular directions of the propagating partons .    the matrix elements required to calculate the transports coefficients include diagrams involving exchange of massless gluons which render @xmath12 and @xmath13 infrared divergent .",
    "such divergences can naturally be cured by using the hard thermal loop ( htl )  @xcite corrected propagator for the gluons , i.e. the divergence is shielded by plasma effects . for jet with energy @xmath14",
    "( see  @xcite for details ) the energy loss is given by @xmath15    having known the drag and diffusion  @xcite , we solve the fp equation using green s function techniques with the initial condition @xmath16 along the line of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the solution with an arbitrary initial momentum distribution can now be written as  @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for any parton species .    in order to take into account the jet production geometry",
    "we assume that all the jets are not produced at the same point and the path length traversed by these partons before fragmentation are not the same .",
    "it is also assumed that the jet initially produced at @xmath19 leave the plasma after a proper time ( @xmath20 ) or equivalently after traversing a distance @xmath21 ( for light quarks @xmath22 ) given by @xmath23 .",
    "as this is not a measurable quantity , we have to average it out to obtain the @xmath1 spectra of hadrons : & = & _ fd^2rp(r ) _ t_i^t_l + & & d_^0()/j(z , q^2)|_z = p_t / p_t^j e|_y_j=0 , where @xmath24 is the time when temperature cools down to the transition temperature @xmath25 ( = 190 mev )  @xcite . the temperature profile is taken as in ref .",
    "the nuclear suppression factor , @xmath26 is defined as r_aa(p_t ) = where the suffix ` 0 ' in the denominator indicates that energy loss has not been considered while evaluating the expression .",
    "to understand the relative importance of the energy loss mechanisms we plot the contributions from radiative and collisional processes in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] .",
    "it is observed that collisional energy loss is the dominant mechanism of energy loss for parton energy up to @xmath27 gev for quark ( gluon ) .",
    "nuclear suppression factor , @xmath26 for neutral pions is plotted as a function of transverse momentum in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which describes the phenix data@xcite for @xmath3 at @xmath28 gev reasonably well .",
    "it should be noted here that the @xmath0 with collisional loss has a tendency to increase for higher @xmath1 , indicating diminishing importance of collisional loss at this domain , where the radiative loss may become important .",
    "therefore , a detailed calculation with both collisional and radiative loss may be useful to delineate the importance of individual mechanism .",
    "it is important to note that the result for @xmath29 is very sensitive to the initial temperature ( @xmath30 ) , equation of state(eos ) ( through velocity of sound ( @xmath31 ) ) and the thermalization time ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig1a ] ) .",
    "this aspect , has not been received much attention in the literature .",
    "our calculations show that the data can be reproduced reasonably well with @xmath30 = 450 mev , @xmath33=0.2 and @xmath32=0.15 fm / c similar to those required to reproduce the single photon data  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have used the @xmath0 for @xmath34 measured by phenix collaboration to characterize the qcd medium created after the au + au collisions at rhic .",
    "the data can be be explained with @xmath35 mev depending upon the eos , _",
    "i.e. _ velocity of sound , @xmath31 in the medium . for a lower value of @xmath31",
    "the expansion is slow .",
    "consequently , the energy loss process occurs for a longer duration in the medium for a given @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for smaller values of @xmath31 the corresponding @xmath30 is smaller .",
    "our investigations suggest that in the measured @xmath1 range of light hadrons at rhic collisional , rather than the radiative , is the dominant mechanism of jet quenching .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to all the previous analyses ."
