    "it is known since a long time that @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons can undergo particle - antiparticle mixing , due to second - order weak interactions which involve box diagrams .",
    "if cp violation is neglected , the cp eigenstates of the @xmath6 system are also mass eigenstates and the probability that a purely @xmath7 state produced at time t=0 will decay as a @xmath7 or @xmath8 at time t is : @xmath9}{2\\tau}\\ ] ]    the oscillation frequency @xmath10 is the mass difference between the two mass eigenstates , @xmath11 is the average lifetime and @xmath12 = + 1 ( resp -1 ) if the final state is a @xmath7 ( resp @xmath8 ) .    in the framework of the standard model ,",
    "@xmath10 may be computed with a rather large uncertainty coming from qcd correction factors .",
    "the ratio of the oscillation frequencies is under better control :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 contains all theoretical uncertainties .",
    "therefore the measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath2 oscillation frequencies should give constraints on the poorly known ckm matrix elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these constraints are conveniently expressed in the framework of the wolfenstein parametrisation of the ckm matrix , introducing the so - called unitarity triangle .",
    "the four lep experiments aleph , delphi , l3 and opal use data taken at the z peak from 1991 to 1995 . they have accumulated about 4 million hadronic",
    "z decays each , i.e. about one million pairs of b mesons , with the following properties :    - b mesons are produced with a large boost ( mean momentum around 35 gev / c ) , giving a decay length around 2 to 3 mm ;    - all experiments have good silicon vertex detectors and obtain a resolution on the decay length around 300 micrometers ;    - the particle identification , which is very important for @xmath2 studies , is done through de / dx measurements in aleph and opal , and using a rich ( ring imaging cerenkov counter ) in delphi",
    ".      the collider detector facility at fermilab has collected 130 @xmath17 of @xmath18 collisions at centre of mass energy 1.8 tev since 1992 . at the collider",
    "there is a huge b meson production rate , with a huge background .",
    "the b mesons are produced with a boost which is less favourable than at lep / slc ( mean momentum around 15 gev / c ) .",
    "the sld collaboration at slac has taken around 500000 hadronic z0 decays between 1993 and 1997 , 350000 of which are analyzed .",
    "the excellent performances of the sld vertex detector allow a much better decay length resolution than lep experiments ( around 50 - 100 micrometers ) .",
    "in addition , the electron beam polarisation may be used as a powerful tool for the b meson tagging @xcite .",
    "the particle identification is done using a ring imaging cerenkov counter .",
    "all analyses require reconstruction of the decay time of the @xmath7 mesons .",
    "this is done by the measurement of the decay length and of the momentum of the @xmath7 . as it is impossible to describe in detail all existing measurements ,",
    "only the basic principles are given in this section .",
    "the @xmath7 meson is in general identified by the detection of a high energy , high pt lepton .",
    "inclusive lepton analyses demand that this lepton has a large impact parameter with respect to the interaction point .",
    "this gives several tens of thousands of events , but with a low purity ( e.g. 10% for the @xmath2 ) .",
    "in addition , one can search for the exclusive decay of a charmed meson .",
    "for instance for @xmath0 decays one looks for a @xmath19 final state , with @xmath20 ; the @xmath21 meson is then searched for via its hadronic decays e.g. @xmath22 . for @xmath2",
    "decays one looks for a @xmath23 final state , then for @xmath24 hadronic decays such as @xmath25 .",
    "the charmed meson is used together with the lepton to reconstruct the @xmath7 decay vertex ; then the decay length is computed from this vertex and the event interaction point .",
    "these semi - exclusive analyses give some hundreds of events per experiment , with a purity which may be as high as 50% .    in a recent analysis delphi @xcite",
    "reconstructs fully hadronic decays of the @xmath2 .",
    "this gives some tens of events , with a very high purity .",
    "the @xmath7 boost is computed using the lepton , the reconstructed charmed meson and , when possible , the neutrino energy estimated from the missing energy . typical values of the decay time resolution for lep experiments are around 0.3 ps for inclusive lepton analyses , 0.15 ps for charm - lepton analyses , and 0.06 ps for the delphi exclusive @xmath2 reconstruction .",
    "sld obtains a resolution of 0.06 ps for @xmath26 events .",
    "one has to know if the detected @xmath7 meson has oscillated or not before decaying ; therefore it is necessary to tag it both at production and at decay time .",
    "the tagging of the @xmath7 at decay time is obtained simply by the charge of the energetic lepton , since e.g. a positive lepton @xmath27 is the signature of the decay of a @xmath7 meson .",
    "this final state tagging is not perfect since one may detect a lepton from a @xmath28 decay ; the corresponding mistag probability is computed from simulated events .",
    "this is much more complicated .",
    "usually one divides the event in two opposite hemispheres defined with respect to the event thrust axis ; several tags are used in each hemisphere :    * in the @xmath7 hemisphere , the nature and the charge of the most energetic fragmentation track carries information on the production state of the @xmath7 meson : e.g. an energetic @xmath29 is produced in association with a @xmath2",
    ". one can also use the sign of the jet charge in this hemisphere .",
    "* in the hemisphere opposite to the detected @xmath7 , several tags may be used .",
    "first , one can search for an energetic lepton with large pt and impact parameter .",
    "one can also use the jet charge of the hemisphere .",
    "the sign of the lepton and of the jet charge indicate if a @xmath30 or @xmath31 quark was produced in this hemisphere .",
    "this initial state tagging is far from being perfect .",
    "there are experimental difficulties : particle misidentification , incorrect attribution of a charged track to the primary vertex , etc .. and possible mistags due to physics : the b quark in the opposite hemisphere may give a @xmath7 meson which may oscillate before decay , or the detected lepton may come from the decay of a charmed hadron .",
    "all these mistag probabilities must be carefully computed using the simulation .",
    "there are presently about 35 different time - dependent @xmath7 oscillation analyses , some of them being presented for the first time at this conference .",
    "the oscillation frequency is fitted from a likelihood fit to the complicated decay probability function which includes all the tags , mistag probabilities and efficiencies coming from detailed monte carlo studies .",
    "four new measurements are available since the 1997 summer conferences :    - one from cdf @xcite , using @xmath32 and @xmath33 correlations with the following result :    @xmath34    - from l3 @xcite , three analyses using lepton - lepton decay length , lepton - jet charge and lepton - lepton impact parameter , giving :    @xmath35    these new results are combined with all the previously published ones , resulting in an average of 24 @xmath36 measurements :    @xmath37    this average may be combined with the time - integrated mixing measurements made by cleo and argus at the @xmath38 resonance , giving the following world average : @xmath39    this world average is now dominated by systematics ( 0.013 ps .",
    "systematic error , whereas the statistical error is 0.010 ps .",

    "figure 1 gives the average of the measurements of obtained by each experiment .      from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the @xmath2 oscillation frequency is expected to be about 20 times greater than that of the @xmath0 .",
    "as the @xmath2 meson production rate is about 1/4 that of the @xmath0 , the search for @xmath2 oscillations is therefore an experimental challenge . up to now",
    ", no measurement of is available ; only lower limits are obtained from 11 existing analyses .    at this conference ,",
    "the results described below have been presented for the first time .",
    "all limits given below are 95% confidence level limits .",
    "- delphi @xcite has presented a new limit using 280 @xmath40 events , the @xmath24 being reconstructed in 6 hadronic and 2 semileptonic decay modes .",
    "they obtain a lower limit of @xmath41 .",
    "- delphi @xcite gives a lower limit of @xmath42 from fully reconstructed @xmath2 mesons ( they have @xmath43 events reconstructed in 8 decay channels ) .",
    "these events give an important contribution for high values ( above 10 ps . ) due to their excellent proper time resolution .",
    "- sld @xcite has presented three analyses : lepton - d , charged dipole , lepton + tracks .",
    "they exclude the following regions :    @xmath44    - cdf @xcite has presented @xmath45 events with @xmath46 correlations , from which they obtain a lower limit of @xmath47 .    at the time of the conference",
    ", the overall combination could not yet be done .",
    "this has been done since that time by the lep working group , using the method defined in @xcite .",
    "the resulting preliminary world average of the amplitudes is displayed in figure 2 , and the preliminary lower limit is @xcite :    @xmath48    with a sensitivity of @xmath49 .",
    "f. parodi et al . @xcite have studied the consequences of the above results for the unitarity triangle .",
    "they find rather strong constraints on the triangle apex position:@xmath50 , @xmath51 and also a strong constraint on the @xmath52 angle : @xmath53 .",
    "this is especially interesting before the starting up of the b - factories at slac and kek , which will measure this angle directly .",
    "they find also that within the present knowledge of all parameters , the allowed range of @xmath54 is @xmath55 at 95% cl .",
    "this means that half of the allowed range is already experimentally excluded .",
    "the most recent individual measurements of the @xmath0 oscillation frequency from l3 and cdf are impressively precise",
    ". however the present world average has a precision around 3% , and therefore future improvements are expected to be modest .",
    "the limit on @xmath54 should improve appreciably in the near future .",
    "the lep experiments still have room for improvement , especially aleph and opal .",
    "sld should also give new limits using their full statistics on tape and cdf will give more results on their present data using new channels .    in a more distant future ( 2 years )",
    ", new results should come from sld if they run in 1999 ( expected sensitivity around 20 @xmath56 ) . in year 2000 , the hera b experiment at desy will have data , and at the fermilab collider the cdf and d0 collaborations will collect new data with an expected sensitivity of 25 @xmath56 .",
    "this would explore the full domain allowed to @xmath54 by the standard model .",
    "using the most recent cdf and l3 measurements , the @xmath0 oscillation frequency is now measured with an accuracy of almost 3% :    @xmath57    new analyses on the @xmath2 oscillation frequency give the following combined new lower limit :    @xmath58    this result excludes already half of the allowed region for @xmath54 in the standard model , and gives efficient constraints on the unitarity triangle .",
    "improvements on the @xmath54 limit are expected from updated lep analyses and from new data at sld and at the fermilab collider",
