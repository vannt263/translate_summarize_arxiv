    "the central limit theorem is one of the most celebrated results in statistics and applied probability .",
    "originally formulated by laplace , it states that the sum of many independent variables tends to a gaussian distribution in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the central limit theorem is used to estimate error bars in all sorts of physical experiments .",
    "it also justifies why the probability density of magnitudes as diverse as the iq of a large sample of individuals or the noise in a radio signal approaches the so - called ` bell curve ' , by postulating that such quantities are the sum of many independent ( microscopic ) contributions .    in this work we somehow reverse this reasoning and consider the problem of extracting information about the ` micoscropic variables ' provided that we know the experimental macroscopic data .",
    "specifically , we are interested in how different constraints over discrete microscopic models manifest in the macroscopic limit .",
    "the reason why we restrict our study to discrete models is two - fold : on one hand , from a practical point of view , discrete systems adopting a finite ( small ) set of possible values are preferred in computational modeling , due to the modest memory resources required to store and manipulate them .",
    "if the internal mechanisms of a given -say- biological process at the cellular level are unknown but there is plenty of data available about the macroscopic behavior of a group of cells , it is thus advisable to search for discrete models for individual cell behavior . on the other hand , from a foundational point of view , there exist some physical quantities , like time and space , which , although traditionally regarded as continuous , could actually be discrete ( see the causal set approach to quantum gravity @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to know if such a discretization leaves a signature at the macroscopic level .    in this paper",
    "we will perform a thorough analysis of this mathematical problem .",
    "we will show that , if the spectrum of the microscopic variables is finite and fixed a priori , then there always exist macroscopic bivariate distributions which can not be approximated with such microscopic models .",
    "in fact , deciding which gaussian distributions are approximable or not can be cast as a linear program .",
    "we will also arrive at the surprising conclusion that certain spectra of infinite cardinality do _ not _ allow to reproduce all bivariate covariance matrices .",
    "if the spectrum of the microscopic systems is free but finite , then several @xmath1-tuples of @xmath2-valued variables are needed to recover all @xmath1-variate gaussian distributions , and the problem of deciding if a given gaussian distribution is generated by @xmath0-valued microscopic systems can be solved via semidefinite programming .",
    "based on the ubiquitous applicability of the central limit theorem , we expect our results to be applicable in a large variety of scientific situations where one wants to infer microscopic information from macroscopic data , such as molecular biology , genetics , neuroscience or social sciences .",
    "we will mainly illustrate this potential in the context of quantum mechanics , but we will also give some new results about brownian motion in the plane and provide a operational meaning to the problem qpratio , recently introduced in complexity theory @xcite .    based on the mathematical results we give in the paper , the main application we can infer within quantum mechanics are ways of proving that a simple quantum experiment can not have a simple classical explanation , where we measure the complexity of an explanation by the size of the underlying discrete sample space .",
    "this type of measure of complexity in the quantum case has become important in last years by ( 1 ) the realm of quantum information theory , where hilbert spaces are finite dimensional and ( 2 ) the need to have small hilbert space dimension in some security proofs of quantum key distribution protocols , like the original bb84 .    indeed ,",
    "examples of how to get experiments with a simple quantum explanation but a complex classical one have appeared recently in the quantum information literature , albeit in a completely different setup : snapshots of a markovian evolution at different times @xcite .",
    "along these lines , using the techniques developed along this paper , we will show that no finite classical model can account for the intensities observed when both sides of a bipartite state consisting of many copies of the maximally entangled state are subject to extensive equatorial spin measurements .",
    "since each of the microscopic quantum variables involved can adopt one of two values ( up or down ) in each instance of the experiment , the quantum description can thus be considered infinitely less complex than its classical counterpart .",
    "this result has a direct implication in the field of foundations of quantum mechanics : in @xcite it was shown that any bell - type quantum experiment admits a classical explanation when brought to the macroscopic scale ( this phenomenon was named _ macroscopic locality _ ) .",
    "however , the particular classical model found in @xcite seemed excessively convoluted : whereas the quantum variables could adopt a finite number of values , the spectrum of the classical ones was continuous , ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "now we know that one indeed needs such complexity for the classical model .",
    "one can also obtain easily with the results of this paper that _ light is infinite dimensional _ , or formally , that homodyne measurements over bipartite gaussian states of light can not be understood as collective spin measurements over ensembles of independent pairs of correlated microscopic particles .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : first , we will describe in detail a simple scenario where microscopic effects over the macroscopic variables can already be seen .",
    "we will give a first illustrative application of that to brownian motion .",
    "then , in section [ fixed_output ] , we will study the general problem of characterizing gaussian distributions generated by microscopic variables with a fixed output structure .",
    "we will treat both the finite and infinite dimensional case .",
    "we will also address some problems which may arise in practical implementations of macroscopic experiments . in section [ free_output ] we will analyze the case where the set of possible values of the microscopic variables is not known a priori and may actually vary between independent tuples .",
    "the complexity of the problem will be treated next , and the consequences for foundations of quantum mechanics will be covered in section [ quantum_non_loc ] . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we will present our conclusions .",
    "suppose that two parties , say alice and bob , perform an experiment like the one described in fig .",
    "[ simple_ex ] , that allows them to measure the continuous variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "after many repetitions of the experiment , they find that @xmath5 and @xmath6 follow a bivariate gaussian probability distribution @xmath7 , characterized by the values    x , y,_xxx^2-x^2 , _",
    "yyy^2-y^2 , _ xyxy - xy .",
    "alice and bob then make the hypothesis that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not gaussian by accident , but because they actually correspond to the sum of many pairwise - correlated independent variables .",
    "a plausible explanation is that whenever they initialize their experiment , multiple particle pairs are created in some intermediate region .",
    "suppose for simplicity that the particles of each pair are identical and have only two levels ( figure [ simple_ex ] ) .",
    "that is , whenever some particle impinges on a detector , it will release a signal of strength @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) if the particle happened to be on state @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ) will reach the photocounter and thus produce @xmath12 electrons , whereas no electrons ( @xmath13 ) will be released if the photon was horizontally polarized ( state @xmath11 ) . ] ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are just the sum of all such individual signals .",
    "we will call this theory the _ microscopic dichotomic model_. alice and bob could propose this model , for instance , to explain why the outcomes of homodyne measurements in usual quantum optical experiments follow gaussian distributions .    we will next show that , in certain circumstances , the microscopic dichotomic model can be experimentally refuted , even when no assumptions are made on the values of @xmath14 , the number of particles @xmath15 and even allowing for the existence of different types of particles , each of them dichotomic , associated to different values of @xmath16 .     observed by alice and bob are the coarse - grained sum of all such microscopic interactions.,width=13 ]    we suppose then that our probability distribution follows from a microscopic dichotomic model . in this model",
    "we allow for the existence of several types of independent pairs of correlated particles and for each of these types of particles we assume a dichotomic model .",
    "the contribution to the expectation values and covariance matrix of each pair of particles @xmath17 is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 denotes the probability that in one of the pairs of type @xmath17 , alice s particle is in state @xmath20 and bob s , in state @xmath21 ; @xmath22 represent the corresponding marginal probabilities and @xmath23 are the corresponding possible values .",
    "now , we assume that every pair of particles is independent from the others .",
    "therefore , calling @xmath24 to the number of pairs of particles of type @xmath17 , we have that the expectations and the values of the covariance matrix @xmath25 are given by    @xmath26    the values of @xmath27 do not carry much information about the original microscopic distribution , since we can set them to any value while leaving @xmath25 invariant . indeed , suppose that we add to the ensemble a species of particles such that @xmath28 .",
    "then , setting @xmath29 and varying the value of @xmath8 ( or , equivalently , the number of particles of such species present in the ensemble ) , we can vary the value of @xmath30 without affecting @xmath31 or @xmath25 .",
    "likewise , we can choose the value of @xmath31 .",
    "we will search for the information about the origin of @xmath5 and @xmath6 hidden in @xmath25 . concerning this",

    "the rest of the inequalities are proven analogously .    to show the opposite implication ,",

    ".    the first covariance matrix on the right - hand side of the above equation can be attained by a species of particles following the microscopic distribution @xmath43 , for @xmath44 .",
    "the diagonal matrix corresponds to a situation where the particles composing the pair are independently distributed . adding to the previous ensemble a new species of particle pairs with    @xmath45    we thus manage to reproduce @xmath25 .",
    "note that , for any @xmath46 , any gaussian bivariate distribution with covariance matrix of the form    _",
    "xx=1/r,_xy=1,_yy = r+[useful ]    violates the inequalities ( [ basic ] ) as long as @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that not all bivariate gaussian distributions can be generated by sums of independent pairs of identical two - valued particles .",
    "the analysis of macroscopic continuous data can thus give us important clues about the microscopic structure that lies underneath .    on a foundational side",
    ", this result implies that alice and bob can design a quantum optics experiment in order to disprove that entangled gaussian states of light follow a microscopic dichotomic model .",
    "we will come back to this topic in section [ uniform ] .",
    "our aim here is to generalize the problem posed in the previous section .",
    "that is , given a set of gaussian variables @xmath48 , we consider the problem of extracting information about the underlying microscopic model that gave rise to them .",
    "equivalently , we are interested in how different restrictions on such a microscopic model translate to the macroscopic scale .",
    "suppose , for instance , that we wonder if @xmath49 could derive from several independent @xmath1-tuples of @xmath0-level particles impinging on different detectors .",
    "we conjecture that each detector @xmath50 is _ simple _",
    ", i.e. , it produces a signal of magnitude @xmath51 when a particle on state @xmath20 impinges on it ( we will see later that this assumption can be relaxed ) .",
    "we can thus regard each particle impinging on detector @xmath52 as a @xmath0-valued microscopic variable @xmath53 .",
    "suppose now that we have partial knowledge of our measurement devices .",
    "specifically , imagine that we know the sets of values @xmath54 up to a proportionality constant . such is the case , for instance , when the response function of each detector is proportional to the spin of the incident particle , but we ignore the precise value of the coupling constant ( see section [ uniform ] ) .",
    "in that case , we could take @xmath55 .    for fixed @xmath56",
    ", we want to determine which @xmath1-variate gaussian distributions can be generated by independent tuples of correlated microscopic variables with spectrum proportional to @xmath57 . in the generic case",
    "( whenever each set @xmath58 has positive and negative values ) , it is easy to see that the expectations @xmath59 can be varied at will without modifying the @xmath60 covariance matrix @xmath61 of the macroscopic system . as before we will focus in the information about @xmath57 contained in @xmath25 .    as in the previous section ,",
    "we want to allow for the possible existence of different types of particles , each of them with their own values @xmath51 .",
    "our aim , thus , is to characterize those covariance matrices that can be expressed as    _",
    "ij_l=1^n _ a , b=1^d ^i_a^j_b\\{p^l_ij(a , b)-p^l_i(a)p^l_j(b)}.    in this expression , @xmath62 indexes the different @xmath1-tuples @xmath63 , and @xmath64 denotes the @xmath65 possible value of the variable @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is the probability that variables @xmath66 , @xmath68 attain the values @xmath69 , @xmath70 , respectively . with a slight abuse of notation , by @xmath71 we mean @xmath72 .",
    "note that , for any @xmath73 , the families of covariance matrices attainable with the sets of outcomes @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the same .    in order to solve the above problem , as well as some others that will appear along the article , we have to introduce the concept of _ naked covariance matrix_.      imagine an idealized detector that , when impinged by a @xmath0-level particle , sends a signal of magnitude 1 to one counter or another depending on the state of such a particle . if we were to send a beam of particles of the same species to this detector , the macroscopic current @xmath76 measured on each counter",
    "@xmath77 would thus indicate the number of particles of the beam @xmath52 in a particular state @xmath20 .",
    "we will call such a device a _ naked detector_.    note that , if the values of @xmath78 are known , we can simulate the behavior of a simple detector by means of a naked detector , see figure [ naked_dressed ] .",

    "if we were able to characterize the cone of all possible covariance matrices @xmath80 generated by @xmath1-tuples of @xmath0-valued variables impinging on @xmath1 different naked detectors , we could thus describe the set of covariance matrices generated by simple detectors .     into sub - beams of particles in the same state @xmath20 , and then measures the intensity @xmath81 of each sub - beam . as indicated in the figure , we can simulate a simple detector by postprocessing the outputs of a naked detector.,width=13 ]    fortunately , such a characterization is possible .",
    "the next technical result will be used extensively along the rest of the paper .",
    "[ naked ] let @xmath82 be an @xmath83 matrix . for any pair of lists of outcomes @xmath84 , consider the microscopic distributions    p(a_1,a_2, ... ,a_n)=_k=1^n(,)+_k=1^n( , ) ,    where @xmath85 denotes the kronecker delta , and call @xmath86 their associated naked covariance matrices .",

    "now @xmath95 is symmetric with respect to the interchange @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , it can be written as a convex sum of distributions of the form    @xmath97    where @xmath98 .",
    "the contribution of each of them to @xmath82 is thus proportional to    @xmath99    on the other hand ,    @xmath100    @xmath82 therefore lies inside the cone of @xmath101 .",
    "now , let @xmath25 be a covariance matrix generated by microscopic variables variables with known spectrum @xmath74 . since @xmath102 for some naked covariance matrix @xmath82 , theorem [ naked ] tells us that @xmath25 is inside the cone generated by the covariance matrices    _ ij(,)_a , b=1^d^i_a^j_b_ij^ab(,)=(,)(,)^t ,    where @xmath103 satisfies @xmath104 .",

    "the set of all covariance matrices arising from the microscopic model @xmath74 is therefore a polygonal inner approximation to the circle corresponding to general gaussian distributions , and so the latter contains points separated from the former as long as @xmath105 .",
    "due to molecular collisions , a particle floating in a two - dimensional fluid will experience random kicks that will make it move in unpredictable ways .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ brownian motion _ , in honor of its discoverer , the botanist robert brown .",

    "consequently , they are able to estimate the probability densities @xmath504 . if their measurements are sufficiently coarse - grained ( but precise enough to detect fluctuations in the values of @xmath505 ) , this set of gaussian marginal distributions will always admit a local hidden variable model , that is , a classical explanation.,width=10 ]    while the particles in each pair will not be necessarily identical , it is not unreasonable to assume that alice s ( bob s ) interaction does not change the nature of such particles , but only their level probability distribution .",

    "this classical theory , though , seems unnecessarily convoluted : note that , independently of the number of levels @xmath518 in the original quantum experiment , the corresponding classical particles have a continuous spectrum .",
