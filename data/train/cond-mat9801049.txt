    "the low - energy electronic excitation spectrum in high - temperature superconducting cuprates has been controversial ever since the first experimental data were reported on the subject more than 10 years ago .",
    "the standard measurement techniques used to obtain experimental data have been mainly infrared reflectivity , transmission and ellipsometry together with electronic raman scattering . although there was significant agreement regarding the raw data between different groups@xcite , controversy arose when interpretation of the spectra was attempted .",
    "the single particle spectrum on the other hand was very successfully investigated by angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes)@xcite .",
    "however in this case , just as for optical spectroscopy , the complexity of the observed multi - component spectral features necessitates the use of a model in interpreting the data . furthermore in all time - integrated spectroscopies the issue of whether the spectrum shows homogeneous or inhomogeneous linewidth can not be easily circumvented , so particle lifetimes determined by these techniques are necessarily ambiguous .    in this paper",
    "we describe an example of the application of time - resolved optical spectroscopy to the direct investigation of low - energy electronic excitation dynamics .",
    "the method by default directly gives quasiparticle lifetimes in the case of high - temperature superconductor materials . from such measurements as a function of temperature and doping @xmath3 in yba@xmath11cu@xmath1o@xmath12 we are able to infer the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation of quasiparticles at @xmath8 in the underdoped state and a cross - over to bcs - like state near optimum doping",
    "the success of the time - resolved spectroscopy method relies on two factors .",
    "firstly the technological developments of femtosecond lasers and related technology , with the recent development of high - frequency lock - in amplifiers .",
    "secondly - a particularly important generic feature of the cuprate materials - the existence of a charge - transfer resonance in the wavelength region of 800 nm easily accessible by these lasers .",
    "the assignment of this resonance by use of laser wavelengths ranging from 1500 to 350 nm has been particularly important for the understanding the time - resolved measurements@xcite . in previous work@xcite@xmath13@xcite , the spectroscopy off - resonance ( usually at 2 ev ) showed features which were substantially more difficult to interpret .",
    "the laser used in the present time - resolved experiment was a ti : sapphire mode - locked laser giving 150 fs pulses at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 88 mhz .",
    "the pump pulse train average power was typically between 10 and 120 mw , while the probe pulse train was typically 0.2 mw or less .",
    "the two beams were focussed onto the sample mounted onto a copper block in an oxford instruments microstat .",
    "the pump beam was modulated at 200 khz and the probe detected via an amplified photodiode and a high - frequency digital lock - in amplifier ( eg&g 7260 ) .    for the understanding of the present experiments , it is important to establish that the optical transitions involve excitations from the ground state ( of predominantly o character ) near @xmath14 to unoccupied states ( of predominantly cu orbitals ) 1.5 ev above in energy .",
    "in such a resonance case , the changes in the ground state dos occurring with temperature , particularly at @xmath8 and @xmath4 can thus be measured by pump - probe spectroscopy .",
    "the evidence for the assignment given above is summarized below . from early x - ray work of bianconi and",
    "others@xcite it emerged that the charge carriers ( holes ) are located mainly on the o ions , while the cu @xmath15 ( upper hubbard ) band is approximately 1.5 - 1.8 ev  higher in energy ( depending on the material and level of doping ) .",
    "experiments on yba@xmath0cu@xmath16o@xmath17 for example have shown that the charge transfer ( ct ) transition between o and cu is strongly observed in optical conductivity , optical ellipsometry@xcite and absorption spectra@xcite as well as photoconductivity@xcite at 1.8 ev with a typical width of 0.1 ev . upon doping it",
    "splits into two bands approximately @xmath18 ev apart at the insulator - to metal transition@xcite@xmath13@xcite and eventually at optimum doping only a peak at 1.5 ev is clearly visible .",
    "a feature at 1.5 ev is clearly observed also in large - shift electronic raman scattering@xcitewith an apparent splitting observed at @xmath3 @xmath19 0.6 .",
    "this probably indicates that the local symmetry for the cttransition is lower than orthorhombic and has no center of inversion , otherwise the 1.5 ev feature would not be seen both in _ gerade _ ( raman ) and _ ungerade _ ( infrared )  transitions .",
    "further confirmation that the initial states for optical excitations at 1.5 ev cross @xmath14 comes from thermal differential reflectance ( tdr)@xcite and time - resolved ( tr ) optical spectroscopies@xcite .",
    "the former measures the change in reflectivity which occurs at @xmath8 as a result of the redistribution of the dos  and shows distinctly a double peak at 1.5 ev similar to the one seen in the optical conductivity and raman spectra .",
    "tr spectroscopy shows the same feature at 1.5 ev in the optimally doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 - albeit with much lower resolution - also appearing below @xmath8@xcite and is similarly thought to be caused by a redistribution of initial states for the optical transitions at @xmath7 . in this case",
    "the 4 : 1 in - plane to out - of - plane polarization ratio also confirms this assignment . yet more independent confirmation",
    "that the initial states for absorption are at @xmath14 come from arpes@xcite  in conjunction with theoretical calculations , while the effect of doped holes on the 1.5 ev transition was nicely demonstrated by matsuda et al@xcite .",
    "the schematic diagram for the resonant pump and probe processes which is based on the assignment discussed above is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the carriers are first excited by the pump pulse from occupied states at or below @xmath14 . the second",
    ", probing step involves determining - as a function of time - the resulting changes in the density of states at @xmath14 @xmath20 caused by the photoexcited quasiparticles by measuring the change in transmission @xmath21 of the sample with a delayed weak laser probe pulse . in the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "the golden rule gives the _ change _ in optical absorbance of the probe pulse to be proportional to the change in the dos at @xmath14 i.e. @xmath22 @xmath23 caused by the pump pulse . since - as was discussed above - this is in turn proportional to @xmath24 , the time - resolved changes in optical transmission @xmath25 can directly probe temperature- and @xmath3- dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "the probe pulse was polarized in the @xmath26 plane to probe predominantly cuo - plane excitations ( the signal was found previously to be independent of pump polarization@xcite ) .",
    "the induced transmission @xmath27 following the pump pulse typically shows a relatively fast relaxation of @xmath28 0.5 - 3 ps , followed by a distinct long - lived component with a decay time 10 ns or more@xcite , which is most evident in optimally doped ybco with @xmath29 and also for @xmath30 this long lived component is attributed to quasiparticle relaxation in localized states and was discussed in detail by stevens et al@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will only discuss the fast component of the relaxation .",
    "the amplitude of this component was measured _",
    "well below _",
    "@xmath8 as a function of doping @xmath31 in ybco over a wide range of doping .",
    "the results shown in figure 2 indicate that the integrated amplitude - which is proportional to the total number of particles excited , @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35- increases almost linearly with doping , starting at the insulator - to - metal transition at @xmath36 ( near optimum doping , the non - integrated amplitude of the signal actually decreases , but this is not attributed to a drop in the dos , but rather to the fact that the relaxation time @xmath37 starts to increase dramatically for @xmath31 @xmath38    an important feature of the data is that the amplitude is strongly temperature dependent ( figure 3 ) . at low temperatures ( @xmath39 )",
    "the amplitude is nearly temperature independent .",
    "with increasing temperature the amplitude starts to drop and eventually vanishes , such that at room temperature the signal is usually not visible , or very small .",
    "the temperature @xmath4 at which the amplitude @xmath40 drops to zero - indicating a change ( drop ) in the dos  at @xmath14 - increases with decreasing carrier concentration in the underdoped phase in close agreement with the  pseudogap  temperatures for ybco determined from other experiments@xcite .",
    "importantly , near optimum doping the amplitude vanishes near @xmath8 , which has already been noted previously@xcite . in underdoped samples on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude shows _ no change _ at @xmath41 suggesting no changes in the dos  take place at @xmath8 , which as we shall discuss below is presented as evidence for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "as already mentioned briefly above , the quasiparticle lifetime @xmath5 in the superconducting state - determined by fitting a single exponential to the time resolved trace - shows a divergence with increasing carrier concentration @xmath42 in the region close to optimum doping as shown in figure 4 .",
    "in contrast , almost no change in lifetime with @xmath3 is observed above @xmath8 , and is @xmath43 ps at 100 k over the whole range of doping .",
    "importantly , the lifetimes below and above @xmath8 in the underdoped state are typically the same below @xmath44 approaching optimum doping , this is no longer the case , and a clear divergence of @xmath37 is observed at @xmath41 behavior which is well known in bcs  superconductors@xcite and is thought to be due to a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck as @xmath45 from below ( not a hebel - slichter peak ) .",
    "the systematic investigation of the amplitude and relaxation time @xmath37 of the photoinduced optical transmission through thin film samples shows rather well the cross - over in behavior which occurs near optimum doping . in the underdoped state , neither the amplitude ( which is related to the dos at @xmath7 ) nor the lifetime @xmath37 show any effect at @xmath8 . instead ,",
    "both show a gradual change with temperature , the amplitude vanishing at @xmath4 , while the lifetime showing only very gradual change up to @xmath4 . the simplest way to explain the behavior in the underdoped state is to assume that no change in amplitude or relaxation time is observed at @xmath8 because no change in dos ( i.e. gap ) occurs at @xmath8 .",
    "instead - in a typical bose - einstein scenario - the pairs which are formed at @xmath4 only acquire phase coherence at @xmath8 .    the onset of a macroscopically coherent condensed state occurs when the wavefunctions of adjacent pairs overlap sufficiently for phase coherence to be established between them .",
    "we can estimate the temperature at which the phase coherence is established by considering when the debroglie wavelength @xmath46 becomes comparable to the superconducting coherence length @xmath47 thus @xmath48 which , using measured values of @xmath49 a for ybacuo@xcite and @xmath50 gives @xmath51 k , which is close to the observed @xmath8-s in this material .",
    "the density of carriers at the point of condensation is given by einstein@xcite as @xmath52 which , using the same value of @xmath53 and @xmath8 as above , gives @xmath54 which is close to the value estimated from hall data@xcite .",
    "the data in the near - optimally doped material with @xmath55 are distinctly different to the undedoped state .",
    "both the amplitude and the relaxation time show a dramatic change at @xmath41 the latter exhibiting diverging behavior as @xmath56 approaches @xmath8 similar to bcs superconductors like al@xcite .",
    "the amplitude on the other hand shows a rapid drop to zero very close to @xmath8 , also with a bcs - like @xmath56-dependence , suggesting that a gap opens simultaneously with pair formation ( and phase coherence ) as in the bcs  case .    to conclude , time - resolved optical spectroscopy is demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the investigation of quasiparticle dynamics in hts .",
    "the occurrence of be  condensation in underdoped ybco - as suggested by the absence of any observable change in the quasiparticle relaxation time @xmath37 or density of states @xmath24 at @xmath8 in our experiments - is consistent with simple theoretical expectations .",
    "obeyance of the sum rule implies that pairs must form above @xmath8 ( the observed changes in the dos  from @xmath57 suggest that this occurs at @xmath4 ) . in contrast , the optimally doped and overdoped state appears to show a divergence in the quasiparticle lifetime with doping and a bcs - like temperature dependence of both the intensity and lifetime is also apparent .",
    "figure 1 . a schematic diagram of the pump and probe processes in resonance with the 1.5 ev ct  transition in ybacuo .",
    "the carriers relax rapidly to a quasi - steady state between the pump and the probe pulses .",
