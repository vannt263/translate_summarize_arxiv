    "<S> spin gaps can already be identified in the image . </S>",
    "<S> the high contrast enables a precise analysis of the intensity distribution , namely close to e@xmath23 and around the gaps . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the following that the hexagonal anisotropy of the ss dispersion generates a peculiar spectral density pattern in this quantum - confined rashba system .    </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our arpes study to a region of reciprocal space around @xmath15 covering the first brillouin zone of the @xmath11 r @xmath1 reconstruction . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : ce1 ] presents a set of constant energy cuts through the band structure , for several binding energies between 50 mev and 600 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the two contours closest to @xmath26 in panel ( a ) correspond to the spin polarized @xmath27 ss of the biag@xmath2 alloy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these bands exhibit specific features of the giant rashba splitting : the inner contour is circular , while the outer one is hexagonal . </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal third contour around @xmath26 is the backfolded signal of an ag qws . </S>",
    "<S> it is due to the scattering of the photoelectrons from the @xmath0 r @xmath1 surface potential , and therefore is a final state effect of the arpes process . </S>",

    "<S> a description of the band structure is hampered by the large number of bands and by the hexagonal anisotropy of the multigapped structure . </S>",
    "<S> _ ab - initio _ calculations of the constant energy contours face the difficulties of a complex interface structure , and of the dense sampling of @xmath30 space . </S>",
    "<S> we chose instead a phenomenological approach , based on an anisotropic nearly free electron ( nfe ) model , with additional terms describing the hybridization of the surface and quantum wells bands .    due to the lack of structural inversion symmetry of the ( crystal , interface , vacuum ) system , both the ss and the qws </S>",
    "<S> are expected to exhibit a rashba behavior @xcite and to be at least partially polarized . </S>",
    "<S> a spin polarization of the qws , which has been observed e.g. for pb thin films on si(111 ) @xcite , is a prerequisite for the opening of spin gaps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rashba coupling is so weak that the splitting can not be directly observed , and the ag qws appear to be degenerate and parabolic . </S>",
    "<S> the sixfold symmetry of the ss contours is the result of the threefold rotational symmetry of the alloy structure and time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the giant so splitting of the bands has been attributed to i ) an anisotropy in the in - plane surface potential @xcite , ii ) the buckling of the bi alloy layer , contributing to the anisotropy of the ss wavefunction along the surface normal @xcite ; or again iii ) the unquenching of the orbital momentum at the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> time reversal symmetry requires that the two spin branches of a rashba system have opposite polarization , so that each branch can be considered separately in discussing their hybridization with other states . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the snow - flake - like contour of the fermi surface of bi@xmath2te@xmath31 was simulated by adding higher order terms to an effective hamiltonian @xcite . a similar nfe calculation for the bi / si(111 ) </S>",
    "<S> interface @xcite yields a good agreement with the experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we extend that approach to the present case . </S>",
    "<S> we used the following spin hamiltonian with the basis states @xmath32 , @xmath33 , ( @xmath34 ) , to describe the spin polarized branches of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 ss :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are respectively the negative effective mass of the ss , the binding energy of the surface band and the effective rashba constant , and @xmath39 is an anisotropy parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 states are different . </S>",
    "<S> each spin - branch of the qws is described by a parabolic band of @xmath40 character :    @xmath41    where the effective mass of the qws , @xmath42 , is the same whatever the index ( @xmath43 ) of the quantum well band . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 , the binding energy of the @xmath45 quantum well band , follows the standard confinement law along one dimension . @xmath44 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 can be fit to the unperturbed qws dispersion far from the ss . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath46 describing the hybridization between the quantum well states @xmath47 and the @xmath48 and @xmath49 ss were adapted from @xcite , and assumed independent of the orbital character of the ss . </S>",
    "<S> a full polarization for the qws is enforced by setting the hybridization to @xmath50 for opposite spin states ; i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 as suggested by group theory considerations @xcite and _ ab - initio _ calculations  @xcite , we also introduce a weak coupling between the @xmath53 and @xmath54 ss : @xmath55 a weak but nonzero coupling is necessary to achieve a good agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> this additional term would lead to a contradiction with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hyb ] ) for @xmath56 large with respect to @xmath46 , which is not the case here . </S>",
    "<S> all parameters ( see appendix ) were determined from the best fits to the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ce1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the qws parameters correspond to a thickness of around 25 ml @xcite . despite its simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , the model captures the main features of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal anisotropy of the surfaces states is not perfectly reproduced near the top of the bands . </S>",
    "<S> the inner bands are closer to @xmath15 and more circular then in the experimental maps . </S>",

    "<S> it should be compared to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kxky]a ) acquired for the same thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data show a stronger spectral weight for the ss than for the qws . indeed , the surface states are strongly localized at the topmost layer whereas the qws lie deeper in the ag layer . </S>",
    "<S> the z - delocalization of the states is not computed so the balance of intensity between the ss and the qws can not be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> the qws are unperturbed at large @xmath30 values as in the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the spin gaps appear here as diamond shapes , e.g. in the ( green ) oval box . </S>",
    "<S> the nfe model predicts that the diamond structures are strongly spin polarized , in agreement with _ </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of the hexagonal symmetry of the ss , the avoided crossings with the qws  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : kxky ] yields further insight into the complex gap structure . as expected , only the @xmath18 and the qws contribute to the spectral intensity near e@xmath23 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ce2 ] ( a ) ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ce2 ] ( b ) ( e@xmath61=@xmath9 mev ) the hybridization between the @xmath18 ss and the first qws induces a small decrease of spectral intensity at @xmath62@xmath20 and at the five equivalent wave vectors rotated by @xmath63 from each other . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ce2 ] ( c ) ( e@xmath61=@xmath64 mev ; on the other side of the energy gap ) the spectral weight is largest at the same bz locations . </S>",
    "<S> such a constrast inversion is observed whenever the @xmath18 or @xmath65 ss cross a qws . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kxky ] ( b ) and ( c ) show that it reflects a hybridization gap in one of the spin polarized component of the qws . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the qws acquire a hexagonal anisotropy close to the gaps .    </S>",
    "<S> further from e@xmath23 the band structure is more complex , because the sequence of the bands is affected by hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ce2 ] ( d ) and ( e ) ( e@xmath66 mev ) show an interesting energy range where the outer @xmath67 band hybridizes with the @xmath68 qws , and the outer @xmath65 band hybridizes with the @xmath69 qws . in this window of energy </S>",
    "<S> , only one spin branch of each of the two first qws contributes to the band diagram in the @xmath58 direction whereas there is no spin gap in the @xmath60 direction ( this is also visible in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kxky ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting band topology yields strongly anisotropic polarization patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the two circular signatures close to the center of the image correspond to the top of the @xmath65 bands . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ce2 ] ( j ) ( e@xmath61=@xmath70 mev ) closed contours are visible at @xmath710.3@xmath20 and at the equivalent wave vectors . </S>",
    "<S> they correspond to wiggles in the dispersion , inside the ( red ) square box of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kxky ] , where an nfe model predicts strongly spin polarized states ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , unpolarized states are expected at @xmath72  0.3  @xmath20 and at the equivalent wave vectors , where two bands with opposite polarization cross .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the @xmath73 and @xmath58 band structure is expected to introduce a different response for the electrons involved in the conduction properties along two orthogonal directions . </S>",
    "<S> the viability of a future device based on a similar rashba system depends on the possibility of adjusting the energy positions of the spin gaps relative to the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> we have already shown that the electronic structure of the trilayer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the ag layer @xcite . however , only discrete shifts in the energy position of the quantum well states could be obtained , corresponding to discrete changes of the boundary conditions for the confined @xmath74 ag states . </S>",

    "<S> the total energy shift of the two fully occupied @xmath65 ss is @xmath77 mev , similar to what was observed for biag(111 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , at saturation , the total shift ( @xmath78 ) of the inner @xmath79 branches is equal to @xmath80@xmath20 . while the inner branches of the @xmath79 derived ss ( @xmath81=@xmath82  @xmath20 before doping , and @xmath81=@xmath83  @xmath20 at saturation ) are clearly resolved ( red arrows b and c in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the outer branches , which cross e@xmath23 at @xmath84@xmath20 @xcite , are much weaker due to arpes matrix elements , and a fermi level crossing can be identified only for negative @xmath30 values ( arrow a in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> contrary to the bi - derived ss , the energy of the qws is not affected by the na adsorption . even at saturation </S>",
    "<S> there is no change in the corresponding fermi wave vectors . clearly , the electrons donated by the na atoms dope the biag@xmath3 ss , which are strongly localized at the surface , rather than the deeper lying qws . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a continuous shift of the ss with respect to the qws as a function of na coverage , and a corresponding shift of the gap structure relative to the fermi level . </S>",
