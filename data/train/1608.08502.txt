    "dissipative systems in quantum mechanics have raised interest for many years  @xcite .",
    "a particular reason is that such systems are temporally irreversible ; i.e. there is a preferred time direction in their evolution .",
    "irreversible phenomena , such as dissipation , emerges out of interaction of a system with its neighborhoods , such that the energy flows irreversibly  @xcite .",
    "thus for instance a dissipative force as friction could find a microscopic explanation . in a broad perspective , many microscopic phenomena are described by irreversible models  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the study of irreversible systems in such a framework can shed some light into the very structure of matter , in particular in experimental apparatus with atoms where the neighborhood effect is the cause of dissipation .",
    "this is the case of some procedures with fermions following in parallel with the production and detection of bose - einstein condensates , using the expedients such as laser cooling , magnetic and magneto - optic traps  @xcite .",
    "the fermion counterpart has been accomplished by considering a degenerate fermi gas as well as condensates of rare isotopes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a great deal of interest in studying entangled multipartite fermion states for quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "a simple but intricate example of such a fermion system , at the level of electronic structure , is the helium atom considered as a few - fermion system taken in a external field , which can in turn be considered as a dissipative effect .    for practical analysis ,",
    "it is interesting to note that a combination of two damped quantum harmonic oscillators can describe an atom with two electrons . in this case , the schrdinger equation has no known exact solution .",
    "the results obtained for such systems are based on approximative methods or variational formalisms . however , due to the resemblance between the gaussian wave function of the spherically symmetric harmonic oscillator and the 1@xmath0 state of the hydrogen atom , some models are used to study solutions of the schrdinger equation for helium atom .",
    "it consists in changing the coulomb interactions by the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "in particular , in the work of kestner  @xcite , the electron - nuclei interactions were replaced by a harmonic oscillator potential but the electron - electron interaction was coulombic . then it was shown that the energy values obtained were very close to experimental data .",
    "in the presented work we address this problem , in order to study the non - classicality of such states , considering in addition , dissipation effects .",
    "we proceed by using the quantum mechanics in phase space in order to analyse the wigner function  @xcite .",
    "the analysis in phase space is important in order to track evidences of chaoticity as well as the statistical nature of quantum states . in this case , the wigner formalism is physically appealing , in particular in experiments for the reconstruction of quantum states , in quantum tomography and for the direct measurement of the wigner function  smithey , leibfried , davidovich , vogel , ibort:2009bk , ibort:2010xz , ibort:2012ab .    however , there are difficulties with the direct use of the wigner function .",
    "one is that , there is no gauge symmetry associated with the wigner function , since it is a real function .",
    "this aspect is also a problem for considering superposition effects in phase space .",
    "another difficulty is related with technical reasons : the liouville - von neumann equation in phase space has an intricate nature , with no practical perturbative solution .",
    "for instance , a perturbative theory for fermions is a non - trivial task and remains to be formulated consistently .",
    "this type of problem has lead to an intense search for the analysis of the wigner formalism  , and some advancements have been made ; it includes the study of representations of quantum equations directly in phase - space  @xcite . after some preliminary attempts  @xcite , exploring a representation of the schrdinger equation in phase space  @xcite , a consistent formalism has been introduced  @xcite , by using the notion of quasi - amplitude of probabilities , which is associated with the wigner function by the moyal ( or star ) product in phase space  @xcite .",
    "this notion of symplectic structure and weyl product have been explored to study unitary representations of galilei group , leading to a symplectic ( phase space ) representation of schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "this approach provides an interesting procedure to deriving the wigner function , by using consistently the gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "this symplectic representation was applied in kinetic theory and extended to the relativistic context ; giving rise to the klein - gordon and the dirac equations in phase space  @xcite .",
    "here we use this symplectic quantum mechanics to analyse the behaviour of the wigner function for the helium atom , considering dissipation . in this case",
    ", we study the non - classicality of the state with the non - classicality ( negativity ) indicator of the wigner function  @xcite as a function of the dissipation parameter .    the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii , we present an outline of the symplectic representation the schrdinger equation in phase space and the connection between phase space quasi - amplitudes and the wigner function . in section iii , we solve the schrdinger equation in phase space for the helium atom in the two - oscillator approximation . in section iv ,",
    "a quantum damped oscillator is studied .",
    "finally , some closing comments are given in section v.",
    "in this section we present a brief outline of the construction of the schrdinger equation in phase space , emphasizing the association of phase space amplitude of probability with the wigner function .",

    "( [ ago25.1 ] ) is a fundamental starting point for the description of quantum physics in phase space , fully compatible with the wigner formalism .",
