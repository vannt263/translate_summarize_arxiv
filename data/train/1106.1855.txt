    "the study of quantum mechanical hamiltonians that are @xmath0-symmetric but not hermitian@xcite-@xcite has recently found an unexpected application in classical optics@xcite-@xcite , due to the fact that in the paraxial approximation the equation of propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a medium is formally identical to the schrdinger equation , but with different interpretations for the symbols appearing therein .",
    "it turns out that propagation through such a medium exhibits many new and interesting properties , such as power oscillations and birefringence .",
    "the equation of propagation takes the form [ opteq ] i=-(+v(x ) ) , where @xmath5 represents the envelope function of the amplitude of the electric field , @xmath6 is a scaled propagation distance , and @xmath7 is the optical potential , proportional to the variation in the refractive index of the material through which the wave is passing .",
    "a complex @xmath8 corresponds to a complex refractive index , whose imaginary part represents either loss or gain . in principle",
    "the loss and gain regions can be carefully configured so that @xmath8 is @xmath0 symmetric , that is @xmath9 .",
    "there is also a non - linear version of this equation , arising from sufficiently intense beams , where there is an additional term proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper we shall limit ourselves to the linear case .    a model system exemplifying some of the novel features of beam propagation in @xmath0-symmetric optical lattices uses the sinusoidal potential [ vsin ] v = v_0this model has been studied numerically and theoretically in refs .",
    "the propagation in @xmath6 of the amplitude @xmath5 is governed by the analogue schrdinger equation[opteq ] , which for an eigenstate of @xmath11 , with eigenvalue @xmath12 and @xmath6-dependence @xmath13 reduces to the eigenvalue equation [ h ] --v_0=  .",
    "it turns out that these eigenvalues are real for @xmath2 , which corresponds to unbroken @xmath0 symmetry , where the eigenfunctions respect the ( anti - linear ) symmetry of the hamiltonian . above @xmath4 complex eigenvalues",
    "begin to appear , and indeed above @xmath14 all the eigenvalues are complex@xcite",
    ". clearly one would expect oscillatory behaviour of the amplitude below the threshold at @xmath4 and exponential behaviour above the threshold , but the precise form of the evolution at @xmath4 is less obvious . at first sight",
    "one would expect linear growth because of the appearance of jordan blocks associated with the degenerate eigenvalues that merge at that value of @xmath15 , but , as longhi@xcite has emphasized , this behaviour can be significantly modified depending on the nature of the initial wave packet .    in a previous paper we approached this problem by explicitly constructing the bloch wave - functions and the associated jordan functions corresponding to the degenerate eigenvalues and then using the method of stationary states to construct the @xmath6-dependence .",
    "we found that the explicit linear dependence arising from the jordan associated functions is indeed cancelled by the combined contributions from the non - degenerate wave - functions and were able to understand how this cancellation came about .",
    "in the present paper we approach the problem from a different point of view by revisiting the complementary perturbative calculation of longhi@xcite . in section 2",
    "we briefly recapitulate how the spectrum and eigenfunctions are calculated . then in section 3 , which forms the main body of the paper ,",
    "we give an explicit expression for the first - order contribution and carry out the second - order calculation in detail .",
    "this enables us to investigate the saturation phenomenon for a variety of different inputs .",
    "finally , in section 4 we give a brief discussion of our results .",
    "at the threshold @xmath4 , the potential @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ vsin ] ) becomes the complex exponential @xmath16 , for which the schrdinger equation is [ h1 ] --v_0(2ix / a)= .",
    "this is a form of the bessel equation , as is seen by the substitution @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , giving [ bessel ] y^2+y-(y^2+q^2)=0 , where @xmath19 .",
    "thus the spectrum is that of a free massive particle , shown in the reduced zone scheme in fig .  1 , and for @xmath20 not an integer the solutions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are linearly independent , and have exactly the correct periodicity , @xmath23 , to be the bloch wave - functions .",
    "it is important to note , however , that because the original potential is @xmath0-symmetric rather than hermitian , these functions are not orthogonal in the usual sense , but rather with respect to the @xmath0 inner product , namely dx _",
    "-k(x)_k(x)=_k kdx _ -k(x)_k(x ) ,    however , for @xmath24 , a non - zero integer , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are no longer independent . in that case",
    "the bloch eigenfunctions do not form a complete set , and we must search for other functions , still with the same periodicity , to supplement them .",
    "these are the jordan associated functions , which we denote by @xmath27 .",
    "they may be defined as derivatives of the eigenfunctions with respect to @xmath12 , and satisfy the generalized eigenvalue equation [ jordan ] _",
    "n(y)=i_n(y ) , the crucial feature of the jordan functions is that because of this latter equation they naturally give rise to linear growth in @xmath6 , provided that they are excited : e^-ihz_r & = & e^-i_r z e^-i(h-_r)z _ r&= & e^-i_r z(_r -i z _ r ) . however , as was found numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , and explored further in ref .  , this natural linear growth may become saturated due to the contributions of neighbouring bloch functions , which are closely correlated with those of the jordan functions .",
    "the analysis of ref .   approached the problem from one point of view , in which the interplay between the contributions of the bloch eigenfunctions and the jordan associated functions was made explicit . a complementary way of looking at things , which does not separate these two contributions , is to use the perturbative expansion , which instead emphasizes the contributions of the free propagation and the corrections brought about by the potential .",
    "the general framework for an expansion of @xmath5 in powers of @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 , has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with an approximate form of the first - order term @xmath30 for the case @xmath31 and @xmath32 large . in this section",
    "we generalize this calculation by obtaining analytic expressions for both the first- and second - order terms for general @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "of course , this can only be used as a guide because there is no guarantee that the expansion converges , nor that the large-@xmath6 behaviour of the complete amplitude can be extracted from the behaviour of the truncated series .",
    "we will take as our input a gaussian profile of the form [ gaussian ] ( x,0)=f(x)e^-(x / w)^2+i k_0 x , with offset @xmath34 and width @xmath32 .",
    "the zeroth - order term , @xmath35 , is just the freely - propagating wave - packet _ 0(x , z)=e^ik_0(x - k_0 z)e^-(x-2k_0 z)^2/(w^2 + 4iz ) , while the first - order term , @xmath30 , is given by _ 1(x , z)=-idk ( k ) e^i(k+k_b)x , where ( k)=e^-(k - k_0)^2w^2/4 is the fourier transform of @xmath36 of eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) and @xmath37 is the width of the first brillouin zone . we can reverse the order of integration in the expression for @xmath38 , performing the ( gaussian ) @xmath39 integration first , to obtain _ 1(x , z)&= & -ie^i k_b x - i k_b^2 z-(k_0+k_b)^2w^2 + & & _",
    "0^z dye^-(2k_by-(x+k_bz)+i w^2(k_0+k_b))^2/(w^2 + 4iz).the @xmath40 integration is then also a gaussian integration over a finite range , giving the result [ psi1 ] _ 1(x , z)&= & -i  e^i k_b x - i k_b^2 z-(k_0+k_b)^2w^2((_1)+(_2 ) ) , where _ 1&=&_2&= &  . for the purposes of considering large @xmath32",
    ", it is convenient to rewrite these in the form [ arguments ] _ 1&=&-i(k_0+k_b)(w^2 + 4iz)_2&=&+i(k_0+k_b)(w^2 + 4iz )  .",
    "the case @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath31 , is clearly very special , since in this case the second terms in the contributions to @xmath42 and @xmath43 vanish , so that we get the simple expressions @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in that case ,",
    "as long as @xmath46 the arguments may be treated as effectively real , and each error function behaves like a sign function of its argument ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , so that the sum of the two behaves like the step function @xmath47 .",
    "this is the function @xmath48 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the qualitative features of the perturbative calculation are in complete agreement with the spreading of the wave - function in fig .  3 of that paper , and the saturation grows initially like @xmath6 for small @xmath6 . ] of @xmath49 .",
    "however , in this treatment there is of course no mention of whether or not any jordan functions are excited .    the same expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ psi1 ] ) and ( [ arguments ] ) can also be used for the cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the limit of large @xmath32 . in each case",
    "the arguments @xmath42 and @xmath43 now have a large imaginary part .",
    "in that situation the modulus of the erf has a narrow peak where the real part vanishes ( see fig .",
    "thus the result consists of two narrow rays , which are centered on @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "here we have the seeds of the birefringence first observed in ref .  @xcite . for the case",
    "@xmath54 , the two rays are centered on @xmath55 and @xmath56 , while for the case @xmath51 , or @xmath57 , the two rays are centered on @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we now go on to second - order perturbation theory to investigate the behaviour of @xmath60 , which is given by@xcite _ 2(x , z)=-dk ( k ) e^i(k+2k_b)_0^z d_0^z- d   e^-ik^2z-4ik_b(k+k_b)+ik_b(k_b+2k ) again the @xmath39 integration is a gaussian , which leaves finite - range gaussian integrations over @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is convenient to change the integration variable @xmath61 to @xmath63 .",
    "the integration over @xmath40 then yields the expression _ 2(x , z)=- _",
    "0^z d((a)-(b))e^-2ik_b^2e^ik_bx - ik_b^2t - w^2 ^ 2 , where we have written @xmath64 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given by b&= & + a&= &  .",
    "the final @xmath62 integrations are then of the form i_&&d  ( c_1+c_2)e^c_3 + & = & .",
    "thus in principle @xmath67 is expressible in terms of eight error functions .",
    "however , it turns out in practice that only six are involved .    in the case",
    "@xmath68 , or @xmath31 , when @xmath69 , the arguments of the error functions are such as to give a plateau in @xmath70 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. a widening of the beam to the left of @xmath73 , and a much smaller peak , centered around @xmath59 , that is , a second weak beam to the right .",
    "more importantly , the second - order contribution again shows no sign of the linear growth is proportional to @xmath74 for small @xmath6 . ] in @xmath6 navely expected from the excitation of jordan associated functions .",
    "in the other case , @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath75 , there are three peaks , centered around @xmath55 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , representing a further splitting of the initial beam .",
    "both cases are illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "of course one needs to treat the results of perturbation theory with caution . in general terms",
    "we have no proof that the perturbation series converges , and in particular the asymptotic behaviour in @xmath6 of a few terms of the series does not necessarily give the correct asymptotic behaviour of the entire sum .",
    "nonetheless this series does appear to give reliable results .",
    "for the parameters used by longhi in ref .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath78 , first - order perturbation theory already reproduces the numerical results very well , and the second - order term gives only an extremely small correction .    in all of our calculations",
    "we have not allowed @xmath6 to become too large , restricting it by the condition @xmath79 , in which case saturation is an inbuilt feature of perturbation theory .",
    "in fact it was shown in ref .   using the method of stationary states",
    "that if one goes to much larger values of @xmath6 the amplitude so calculated begins to grow again but this ultimate resumption of linear growth is not physical , because it corresponds to the situation where the beam has widened beyond lateral limits of the optical lattice .",
    "it is an elegant feature of the perturbative expansion that the different types of possible behaviour of the beam - spreading or splitting into two or more beams - arise from very simple properties of the error function depending crucially on the offset @xmath34 . in the first case",
    "the arguments are essentially real , and the error functions behave like sign functions , while in the second case there is a large imaginary part , and the moduli of the error functions behave instead like narrow peaks .",
