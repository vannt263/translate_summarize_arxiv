    "it is generally supposed that a characteristic feature of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , relating the x - ray and optical / uv regime , is the big blue bump ( hereafter bbb ) ( e.g. , elvis et al.1986 ; mathews & ferland 1987 ; for a review see collin 2001 ) , which may be associated with thermal accretion disk emission ( rees 1984 ; laor & netzer 1989 ; band & malkan 1989 ; sun & malkan 1989 ; laor et al.1997 ) .",
    "the presence of the bbb , which is located in the euv range , is indicated by upturns in the far - uv and soft x - rays .",
    "the strength and location of the bbb likely depend on the black hole mass , the luminosity , and the accretion rate ( e.g. , binette et al.1988,1989 ; ross & fabian 1993 ; wandel 1999a , b ) .",
    "however , because a direct observation of the euv range is extremely difficult due to galactic absorption , it is still an open question as to whether the bbb is as prominent as it is generally assumed or whether it is a shallower feature ( laor et al.1997 ) .",
    "the strength of a variety of emission lines in the optical domain and their emission - line flux ratios that are sensitive to different parts of the ionizing continuum in the euv can be used as tracers of the continuum shape and strength ( krolik & kallman 1988 ; binette et al.1989 ; netzer et al.1992 ; zheng , kriss & davidsen 1995 ; korista , ferland , & baldwin 1997 ; alexander et al.1999 ; kraemer & crenshaw 2000 ; dietrich et al.2002 ) .",
    "narrow - line seyfert1 galaxies ( nls1s ) may hold key information about the structure and evolution of agn . although the permitted emission - line profiles in nls1 spectra are unusually narrow ( fwhm @xmath13 kms@xmath11 ) , like in seyfert2 galaxies , strong optical and ultraviolet feii  emission , distinct x - ray continuum properties , and rapid , large amplitude x - ray variations unmask them as type 1 seyfert galaxies ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; goodrich 1989 ; boller et al.1997 ; mathur 2000 ; pogge 2000 ) .",
    "most of the observed properties of nls1s can be explained in the framework of a low - mass black hole ( few times @xmath14 ) and a high accretion rate that is close to the eddington limit ( e.g. , pounds , done , & osborne 1996 ) .",
    "this may explain the soft x - ray excess emission and rapid x - ray flux variations ( e.g. , boller et al.1996 ; grupe et al.1995 ; grupe et al.2000 ; leighly 1999a ) .",
    "nls1 galaxies are prime candidates to investigate the strength and shape of the soft x - ray  euv continuum , since they show generally a strong soft x - ray excess ( boller et al.1996 ; leighly 2000 ) and also steeper hard x - ray continua than normal seyfert1 galaxies ( brandt et al.1997 ; leighly 1999b ) .",
    "recently , wang & netzer ( 2003 ) suggested that the soft x - ray properties of nls1s are natural consequences of their super - eddington accretion rates .",
    "however , only a few nls1 galaxies ( tons180 , turner et al.2002 ; re1034@xmath1539 , casebeer & leighly 2003 ) , have been successfully observed in the euv , revealing evidence for a bbb ( although its strength is uncertain due to uncertainties in the correction for galactic extinction ) .    it has been suggested that broad - line seyfert1 ( bls1 ) galaxies show a small or no bbb ( laor et al.1997 ; zheng et al.1997 ; telfer et al.2002 ) .",
    "there are observational indications that the nlr of seyfert2 , seyfert1 , and nls1 galaxies might be different ( e.g. , schmitt & kinney 1996 ; schmitt 1998 ) , possibly caused by differences in the ionizing continuum sed .",
    "however , to probe different euv  soft x - ray continua it is necessary to study emission lines that cover a wide range in ionization energies , at least up to @xmath16ev ( e.g. , alexander et al.1999 ; kraemer & crenshaw 2000 ) .",
    "studies using emission lines like [ oi ] , [ oii ] , [ oiii ] reveal that different ionizing continua for nls1 and normal bls1 galaxies have only a minor impact on these emission - line ratios ( nagao et al.2001 ) .",
    "thus , probing the ionizing continuum of nls1s in the euv employing emission lines that are sensitive to a wide energy range will provide information on the presence of a bbb and whether the bbb is stronger and shifted to higher energies compared to bls1s , similar to the strong soft state of galactic black holes at high accretion rates ( pounds , done , & osborne 1996 ; brocksopp et al.1999 ; zdziarski et al.2002 ) .",
    "we have observed a sample of 12 bright nearby nls1 galaxies using the 1.5-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( table 1 ) .",
    "the observations have been obtained as part of the _ small and moderate aperture research telescope system _ ( smarts ) collaboration .",
    "the nls1 sample is restricted to bright agn with @xmath17 to record spectra with a signal - to - noise ratio of at least @xmath18 to 40 in the continuum within a reasonable observing time .",
    "we observed the nls1 galaxies using the r - c spectrograph in longslit mode on april 23 to april 27 , 2003 .",
    "the observations were performed under non - photometric conditions except for the last night when the spectra were taken under photometric conditions with subarcsec seeing ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "for the first four nights the seeing varied between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 on average which had no effect due to the large slit width .    a loral 1k ccd detector with @xmath23 pixels ( pixel size @xmath24 ) was used together with grating 26 ( blue , 600 l / mm ) , grating 35 ( red , 600 l / mm ) together with blocking filter gg495 , and grating 36 ( blue , 1200 l / mm ) to observe spectra with higher spectral resolution in the h@xmath1  [ oiii]@xmath25 range . in addition , these spectra of higher spectral resolution were valuable to intercalibrate the spectra observed for the blue and red optical wavelength range .",
    "we used different settings for the blue grating to ensure that the redshifted [ nev]@xmath7 emission line was measured for each of the nls1s in our sample and also different settings for the red grating to record the h@xmath26[nii]@xmath27 emission line complex and the [ sii]@xmath28 emission lines . together with the spectra of high spectral resolution for the h@xmath29  [ oiii]@xmath25 region we covered the entire optical wavelength range @xmath30  .",
    "the slit orientation was east - west and the slit width was set to @xmath31 for accurate absolute flux calibration and to mitigate the effect of atmospheric refraction . due to the design of the 1.5-m r - c spectrograph",
    "the spectral resolution is nearly unchanged for slit widths in the range of @xmath32 to @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to the wide slit width the nls1 galaxies were observed within less than two hours of the meridian to minimize the light loss caused by differential refraction .",
    "the total exposure times for the nls1 galaxies range from 30 to 60 minutes using the blue and red grating , split into two exposures . for the high spectral resolution data two spectra with 20 minutes exposure time each were observed .",
    "the standard stars eg274 , ltt3218 , ltt4816 , and ltt7987 ( hamuy et al.1992 ) were observed for relative flux calibration each night , with exposure times of 5 to 15 minutes in the blue and red wavelength range and 15 to 20 minutes for the spectra with higher spectral resolution .",
    "the nls1 galaxy and standard star spectra were processed using standard midas software .",
    "the night sky component of the 2d - spectra was subtracted by fitting third order legendre polynomials perpendicular to the dispersion , along each spatial row of the spectra using areas on both sides of the object spectrum which were not contaminated by the nls1 galaxies or other objects . to extract 1d spectra we adjusted the extension of the spatial extraction windows to match the seeing recorded during the observation .",
    "we applied spatial extraction windows of sizes with @xmath33 to @xmath34 which includes a significant fraction of the host galaxy spectra .",
    "helium - argon wavelength calibration spectra were taken at the beginning and the end of each observing night .",
    "the achieved spectral resolution amounts to 4.8  for both the blue and red wavelength range ( @xmath35 kms@xmath11 ) , with an internal error of the wavelength calibration of @xmath36 .",
    "the spectra taken with grating 36 have a spectral resolution of 2.6(@xmath37 kms@xmath11 ) .",
    "the same spectral resolution for the employed gratings was derived examining strong night sky emission lines ( [ oi]@xmath38 , [ oi]@xmath3 , and [ oi]@xmath39 ) .",
    "these night sky emission lines indicate an absolute uncertainty of the wavelength calibration of @xmath40  ( @xmath41kms@xmath11 ) .",
    "we corrected each nls1 spectrum for the atmospheric c - band and b - band absorption , caused by @xmath42 molecules using the standard star spectra that were observed during each night .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction applying the standard curve of la silla ( schwarz & melnick 1993 ) and for galactic extinction using the @xmath43 values of dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) and the galactic extinction curve of savage & mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "the sensitivity functions for the blue , red , and higher resolution spectra , based on individual standard stars , differ by less than @xmath44%  from the mean sensitivity functions for the corresponding nights which we used to calibrate the nls1 spectra .",
    "the flux - calibrated nls1 spectra have been transformed to the rest frame using the corresponding redshift given in table 1 .",
    "we derived the redshift for each object by examining the emission - line profile of the strong [ oiii]@xmath25 emission lines .",
    "a gaussian profile was fit to the upper part of the line profile with at least 50%  of the peak intensity .",
    "the rest - frame flux - calibrated spectra of the observed nls1 galaxies are shown in figure 1 .",
    "in contrast to luminous quasars , the host galaxy contribution in the optical , for less luminous seyfert galaxies can be of the order of @xmath45%  in the large aperture that we used . hence , to measure emission line fluxes it is important to correct for possible contamination , particularly to recover weaker emission lines .",
    "almost all nls1 galaxy spectra of our sample show significant host galaxy contributions to the observed continuum level as indicated by the presence of prominent stellar absorption features like caiih and caiik , the mgb band , and the nad absorption in the red wing of the hei@xmath46 emission line .",
    "furthermore , the studied nls1s show strong optical feii  emission features , feii@xmath47 and feii@xmath48 , blueward and redward of the h@xmath29  [ oiii]@xmath49 complex ( fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore , we analyzed each nls1 spectrum employing a multi - component fit based on ( i ) a power law continuum , ( ii ) a template spectrum for the host galaxy contribution ( kinney et al.1996 ) , ( iii ) a template for the feii  emission ( boroson & green 1992 ) , and ( iv ) a balmer continuum emission spectrum ( grandi 1982 ; storey & hummer 1995 ) .    to construct representative host galaxy template spectra we combined several individual spectra of given hubble types .",
    "these galaxy spectra were retrieved from the publicly available sample published by kinney et al.(1996 ) .",
    "the spectral resolution of the galaxy spectra amounts to @xmath50   which is comparable to the spectral resolution of the nls1 spectra that we observed .",
    "the normal galaxy spectra were transformed into the rest frame .",
    "the atmospheric b - band absorption was corrected by linear interpolation . for elliptical galaxies we use templates based on ngc205 , ngc2865 , ngc1407 , and a mean elliptical galaxy spectrum obtained by combining ngc221 , ngc1399 , ngc1404 , ngc6868 , and ngc7196 . the spectrum of ngc584 is used to represent a s0 type galaxy spectrum . the sa type galaxy template spectrum is given as an average of ngc1316 and ngc6340 , and the sb type galaxy template spectrum is created using ngc224 ( m31 ) and ngc3031 ( m81 ) .",
    "the izw1 feii  emission spectrum ( boroson & green 1992 ) is used as an feii  emission template .",
    "this feii  emission template was broadened in accordance with the emission - line profile width of the broad permitted emission line profiles .",
    "the width of the feii  emission lines was allowed to vary in steps of @xmath51 kms@xmath11 which is sufficient for a spectral resolution of about @xmath52 kms@xmath11 that we achieved . to compute balmer continuum emission templates we followed the formalism that was suggested by grandi ( 1982 ) and for the higher order balmer lines ( @xmath53 ) we used the results presented by storey & hummer ( 1995 ) .    for the nls1 galaxies of our sample we fit simultaneously a power law continuum , a host galaxy template , an feii  emission template , and a balmer continuum template to the rest frame transformed spectra .",
    "the hubble type of the host galaxy was an additional free parameter . a first guess for the strength of the host galaxy",
    "was estimated based on stellar features like caiih and caiik , the cn g - band @xmath54 , the mgb@xmath55 triplet , and the nad absorption line that affects the red wing of the hei@xmath46 emission - line profile .",
    "the strength of the individual components of the multi - component fit are displayed in figure 1 for each nls1 under study . in table 2",
    "we list the spectral slopes @xmath4 of the power law continuum fit ( @xmath56 ) together with the hubble type of the host galaxy as indicated by the best fit . while most of the nls1 galaxies of this study show power law continuum slopes in the optical that are in the typical range for agn , i.e. @xmath57 to @xmath58 with @xmath59 on average , four of these 12 nls1 galaxies show very steep power law continua ( @xmath60 to 1.9 , table 2 ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 the host galaxy contribution has a significant impact on the slope of the observed continuum spectrum because these nls1 galaxies were observed with a wide slit width that covered a significant part of the host galaxy . to illustrate the host galaxy contribution to the observed nls1 galaxy spectra we determined the relative flux at @xmath61  .",
    "the fraction of the host galaxy flux compared to the total observed continuum strength at 5100   is given in table 2 .",
    "it can be seen that the host galaxy contributes at this wavelength generally @xmath45%  to the continuum flux for the nls1 galaxies which we observed with a large aperture .    while the contribution of the host galaxy flux can be corrected by employing a properly scaled galaxy template spectrum ( figure 1 )",
    "there is an additional possibility of a contaminating starburst component .",
    "it has been pointed out that for numerous seyfert2 galaxies star formation features are detected in their spectra ( e.g. , cid - fernandes et al.2001 ; gonalves et al.1999 ; vron et al.1981a ) while seyfert1 galaxies are rarely accompanied by a starburst component ( rodriguez - ardila & viegas 2003 ) .",
    "we can not rule out a presence of a young stellar population that would particularly affect the blue part of the spectrum , which might be expected if nls1 galaxies are representing agns in an early evolutionary phase ( e.g. , mathur 2000 ) .",
    "while stellar features might be washed out by a strong emission - line spectrum , a steep power law continuum with spectral slopes in the range of @xmath62 up to @xmath63 ( mkn705 , ngc4748 , and rxsj20002 - 5417 ) can be mimicked by a blue continuum of a young stellar population ( e.g. , leitherer et al.1999 ) .",
    "in addition to the multi - component fit analysis we scrutinized the 2-d spectra of the nls1 galaxies for indications of extended line emission . while we find no indications for extended emission for mkn734 and rxsj20002 - 5417 , most of the nls1 galaxies show some very weak extended emission either for [ oiii]@xmath25 and h@xmath1 or h@xmath4 and [ nii]@xmath5 .",
    "only ngc4748 exhibits faint extended emission in the blue and red part of the spectrum .",
    "however , the intensity of the weak extended emission amounts to less than @xmath64%  to @xmath65%  compared to the peak intensity of the corresponding emission lines . furthermore , if h@xmath4 and [ nii]@xmath5 can be detected their line ratio is in the typical range for agn excitation .",
    "therefore , this weak additional line emission has no significant impact on the measured emission - line fluxes .",
    "the final multi - component fit has been subtracted and the residuum spectra are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the nls1 residuum spectra show that the correction for feii  emission and the underlying host galaxy spectrum uncovers particularly important emission lines like heii@xmath8 , as well as several [ fevi ] and [ fevii ] lines at @xmath66  .",
    "furthermore , the [ oiii]@xmath25 emission - line profiles which we use as profile templates for the nlr emission are corrected for significant feii  contamination by the optical multiplet fe42 ( phillips 1976 ) .",
    "the residuum spectra also illustrate that there is still significant feii   emission - line flux shortward of @xmath67   ( vron - cetty , joly , & vron 2004 ) , the blue end of the feii  emission template that we use for the spectral analysis .      to measure and analyze the flux of nlr emission lines , the blr line emission contribution has to be removed .",
    "generally , a broad emission - line profile can be described using a single or multiple gaussian components ( clavel et al.1991 ; koratkar & gaskell 1991 ; kriss et al.1991 ) but also lorentzian profiles are suggested ( see vron et al.1980,1981a , b ; gonalves et al.1999 ; vron - cetty et al.2001 ) . while for some agns , broad emission - line profiles can be well described with a single lorentzian component , comparable and equally reasonable results can be achieved with gaussian profiles , particularly with a combination of multiple components .    to measure the narrow - line flux , a strong nlr emission line can be used as a template profile . using high - quality spectra of high spectral resolution , whittle ( 1985a ,",
    "b ) has shown that nlr emission lines have similar profiles and especially that the balmer emission - line profiles are identical with the [ oiii]@xmath2 line profile within the uncertainties , even in the case for strongly asymmetric profiles .",
    "therefore , we have used the strong emission - line profiles of [ oiii]@xmath25 to obtain a representative nlr line profile template . to characterize the [ oiii]@xmath25 profiles we have fit these lines using gaussian profiles , as well as lorentzian profiles .",
    "while the [ oiii ] profiles can be well fit for each nls1 galaxy under study using one or two gaussian profiles , generally no reasonable fit has been achieved employing lorentzian profiles . to use consistently the same profile type",
    "we fit both [ oiii ] line profiles with generally two gaussian components . in the case of iras13224 - 3809",
    "we use a single gaussian component while for mkn1239 the strong blue asymmetric [ oiii]@xmath25 line profile requires a third gaussian component . in figure 2",
    "we display the reconstruction of the [ oiii]@xmath68 and [ oiii]@xmath2 emission - line profiles .",
    "these individual gaussian components have a priori no physical meaning by themselves , but are only used to obtain a nlr line profile template .",
    "to measure the narrow - line flux of important forbidden high ionization emission lines like [ nev]@xmath7 , [ neiii]@xmath69 , and [ fevii]@xmath70 , as well as to separate the blr and nlr contributions of permitted emission lines , we used the fitted [ oiii ] profile as the nlr emission - line profile template .",
    "while the nlr profile shape was kept fixed , the strength of the profile template was allowed to vary , as well as slight variations of the profile width and the location in wavelength space .",
    "this approach takes into account that the profile width correlates with the excitation energy of the emission lines and that higher ionization lines tend to be blueshifted relative to lower ionization lines ( e.g. , derobertis & osterbrock 1984 ; whittle 1985b ; appenzeller & streicher 1988 ; erkens et al.1997 ) , while the profile shape of the nlr emission lines is similar ( whittle 1985b ) .",
    "to separate the nlr and blr contributions of the broad permitted emission lines , we used the nlr template profile for the narrow - line emission and two gaussian profiles to represent the broad emission - line profile . following this approach we fit the broad h@xmath1 profile with an appropriately scaled nlr profile , and with a broad and an intermediate gaussian component .",
    "the deconvolution of the broad h@xmath1 emission - line profiles is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "it is evident that the line width of the intermediate component is generally significantly broader ( on average about @xmath71 times ) than the narrow component which is associated with the nlr emission - line flux ( figure 2 , table 3 ) .",
    "however , for mkn705 , mkn1239 , and ngc4748 we detect a quite broad base of the [ oiii]@xmath2 emission line that contributes about @xmath72%  to the total [ oiii]@xmath2 emission - line flux . although it is not necessarily the case that the [ oiii]@xmath2/h@xmath1 emission - line ratio is the same over the range of the entire profile we used the nlr profile template based on [ oiii]@xmath2 to recover the narrow h@xmath1 emission - line flux for mkn705 and ngc4748 . for these two nls1 galaxies",
    "the width of the intermediate component of the broad h@xmath1 emission - line profile is still @xmath73%   broader than the broad base of the corresponding [ oiii ] profile . in the case of mkn1239",
    "the strong blue asymmetry of the [ oiii]@xmath2 emission - line profile which is also detected by vron - cetty et al.(2001 ) , is broader than the intermediate component of the h@xmath29 profile ( fig.2 ) .",
    "hence , for mkn1239 we used only the narrow and intermediate component of the [ oiii ] profile fit to recover the narrow h@xmath1 emission - line flux . for higher ionization lines of mkn1239 like [ nev]@xmath7 this broad component of the [ oiii ]",
    "profile fit was fit independently . in figures 3 to 5",
    "we show the results of the separation of the nlr and blr flux contributions for the h@xmath74[oiii]@xmath75 , the heii@xmath8 , and h@xmath26[nii]@xmath76 emission - line complexes .",
    "the choice of a specific profile type to fit the broad emission - line profiles might have a significant impact on the measurement of the narrow emission - line flux .",
    "because we are using multiple gaussian components we have investigated the range of uncertainty that might be introduced by our approach compared to profile fits based , e.g. on a single lorentzian profile , which could potentially reduce the measured nlr flux ( e.g. , gonalves et al.1999 ; vron - cetty et al.2001 ) .    to estimate these systematic errors we analyzed the h@xmath1 emission line profile of each nls1 galaxy of this study employing a lorentzian profile to fit the broad component .",
    "we studied two cases , assuming a narrow h@xmath1 emission - line flux strength as it is determined using a multiple gaussian fit for the broad h@xmath1 component or assuming that we are overestimating the narrow h@xmath1 emission - line flux by a factor of 2 .",
    "the accordingly scaled narrow - line h@xmath1 profile was subtracted from the entire h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the resulting residuum was fit with a single lorentzian profile . in figure 6 the results of these tests",
    "are displayed for five representative nls1 galaxies of our sample .",
    "although for a few nls1 galaxies ( iras13224 - 3809 , mkn1239 , mkn896 , rxsj20002 - 5417 ) a quite reasonable fit can be achieved , in general , we find that lorentzian profiles yield less satisfying results than the approach we used , i.e. , employing two gaussian components ( figures 2 and 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the fit strongly depends on the wavelength range that is used for a lorentzian profile fit .",
    "if the fit is restricted to the inner part of the line profile , quite reasonable results can be obtained .",
    "however , the broad emission - line flux would be severely overestimated if these fits were extrapolated . if we include the h@xmath1 profiles wings into the fit range , generally the outer parts of the line core are underestimated while the core is significantly overestimated ( figure 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , using a single lorentzian component , line profile asymmetries are causing strong residuals that would require to employ multiple lorentzian components .",
    "although the lorentzian profile fits which are restricted to the inner part of the profile are severely overestimating the flux of the profile wings we used these fits to estimate the uncertainties introduced by the specific choice of a profile type .",
    "the lorentzian profile fit was subtracted from the original data .",
    "the resulting residuum can be associated with the narrow - line h@xmath1 emission which is comparable to the narrow emission - line profile template ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the estimated narrow h@xmath1 flux is on average @xmath77%  higher than the flux we have determined , using a two gaussian component fit .",
    "however , generally strong residua are left and for some nls1s a broad base is present ( mkn705 , mkn896 , ngc4748 ) . for comparison ,",
    "on the right side of figure 6 we show the fit , which we obtained under the assumption that the narrow h@xmath1 emission - line flux might be up to @xmath45%  weaker than the flux we measured and hence result for some cases in rather low line ratios .",
    "although for some nls1 galaxies of our sample a lorentzian profile yields a quite reasonable fit ( iras13224 - 3809 , mkn1239 , mkn705 , rxs , j20002 - 5417 ) , the obtained results are rather poor for nls1s showing profile asymmetries ( eso399ig20 , iras15091 - 2107 , mkn291 , mkn783 , ngc4748 ) .",
    "thus , the approach of using two gaussian profiles to fit the broad emission - line profile is more than reasonable instead of using a mix of different profile types and that the introduced systematic uncertainty is of the order of @xmath77% . it also should be noted that the broad - line profiles show clear inflections in their profile shape which can not be described with a single component , indicating the presence of two components , independent from the type of profile used to fit .",
    "the broad h@xmath1 emission - line profile fit was used as a template to recover the broad emission - line flux of h@xmath4 and higher order balmer lines .",
    "we used the broad h@xmath1 emission - line profile fit as a first guess to recover the broad hei@xmath46 and heii@xmath8 line profiles with a two gaussian component fit . in table 3",
    "we present the results of the analysis of the broad h@xmath29 and heii@xmath8 emission - line profiles .",
    "we find that the nls1 galaxies of our sample show a strong broad profile base for the permitted lines ( figure 2 and table 3 ) .",
    "although the deconvolution into two gaussian components should be taken cautiously , the width of the broad component indicates that nls1 galaxies contain gas at velocities which are in the typical range of bls1 galaxies .",
    "furthermore , there is also the trend that the heii@xmath8 emission line shows a significantly broader line profile than the hydrogen balmer lines ( table 3 ) . on average the broad component of the heii@xmath8 emission line is about @xmath78%  wider than the broad h@xmath29 component ( @xmath79 kms@xmath11 and @xmath80 kms@xmath11 , respectively ) .",
    "these nls1 galaxies show a similar trend of broader heii  emission like normal broad - line seyfert1 galaxies ( bls1s ) ( e.g. , osterbrock 1993 ) .",
    "while the broad components of the permitted emission - line profiles of h@xmath29 and heii@xmath8 indicate an ionization stratification of the blr , the intermediate broad component of these line profiles both show consistently on average a width of @xmath81 to 1250 kms@xmath11 ( table 3 ) .",
    "the measured width of the intermediate broad profile amounts to @xmath82 kms@xmath11 and fwhm(heii@xmath83 ) = @xmath84 kms@xmath11 .",
    "these intermediate permitted line components display typical nls1 profile widths .",
    "it should be noted that with the exception of ctsj13.12 , the nls1 galaxies of this study show wider broad components than the classical definition of a nls1 galaxy ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) which is met by the width of the intermediate component ( table 3 ) .",
    "the presence of high velocity gas in the blr of these nls1 galaxies is further supported by the full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) of the h@xmath29 emission line profile .",
    "since the fwzi of a broad emission - line profile depends crucially on the constraints given by the assumed continuum level , we only provide estimates of the fwzi ( table 3 ) .",
    "the estimated fwzi(h@xmath1 ) for the nls1 galaxies range from @xmath85 to @xmath86 kms@xmath11 with an uncertainty of the order of @xmath87% .",
    "before the measured emission - line fluxes were analyzed , we corrected the observed line fluxes for internal reddening .",
    "generally , it is assumed that the observed balmer decrement , i.e. ( h@xmath88/h@xmath89 , can be used to estimate the reddening , at least for the nlr emission ( e.g. , davidson & netzer 1979 ; netzer 1982 ) .",
    "we assumed an intrinsic balmer decrement of @xmath90 to estimate @xmath43 values using the relation    @xmath91    with r(h@xmath1 ) and r(h@xmath4 ) as corresponding galactic extinction coefficients .",
    "together with a galactic reddening curve we corrected the observed emission line ratios relative to f(h@xmath1 ) applying    @xmath92    with r@xmath93 as the galactic extinction coefficient at the wavelength of the corresponding emission line . although there are indications that the intrinsic balmer decrement is about @xmath94 under agn conditions due to collisional enhancement in the partially ionized zone ( e.g. , gaskell & ferland 1984 ; halpern & steiner 1983 ; netzer 1982 ) we used the classical value of 2.8 for pure recombination caseb . assuming case b with @xmath95 appears to be quite appropriate for the spectra of the studied nls1s because significant [ oii]@xmath0 emission indicates the presence of a large fraction of low density gas ( @xmath96 @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath97 for @xmath100 , osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "thus , additional collisional enhancement , particularly of h@xmath4 is not expected to be strong . to estimate the impact of a larger balmer decrement we also employed @xmath94 as intrinsic balmer decrement .",
    "we find that the resulting reddening corrected line ratios are less than 10%  larger for line ratios shortward of h@xmath1 and less than 10%  smaller for line ratios longward of h@xmath1 using a larger balmer decrement .",
    "hence , even for emission line ratios that involve emission lines like [ oii]@xmath0 and [ oiii]@xmath2 the effect is less than 10% .",
    "as shown in table 2 , we find that the balmer decrements indicate generally larger @xmath43 for the nlr compared to the blr .",
    "however , the @xmath43 values which are estimated for the blr may be overestimated because the intrinsic h@xmath4/h@xmath1 ratio may be larger than the value for pure recombination .",
    "due to collisional enhancement of particularly h@xmath4 ( gaskell & ferland 1984 ; halpern & steiner 1983 ; netzer 1982 ) and complex radiative transfer effects in the higher density blr gas , the h@xmath4/h@xmath1 line ratio might be less useful as a reddening indicator ( e.g. , davidson & netzer 1979 ) . on average the nlr flux ratios of @xmath101 and @xmath102 indicate @xmath103 compared to @xmath104 ( table 2 ) .",

    "the line fluxes have been normalized to f(h@xmath29 ) = 1.0 .      to specify the nature of the ionizing continuum and to obtain a first estimate of the spectral shape we used several emission - line ratios that are suggested by baldwin , phillips , & terlevich ( 1981 ) and veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) . in figure 7",
