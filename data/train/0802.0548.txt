    "there are many optical classification schemes to segregate liners from other emission - line galaxies ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1980 , veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; ho et al . 1997 ) . in this study",
    ", we adopt the new empirical classification scheme recently proposed by kewley et al .",
    "the classification scheme was obtained by analyzing a large sample of emission - line galaxies selected from sdss survey .",
    "these new classification line is very similar to that of heckman et al ( 1980 ) in both slope and intersection .",
    "the bpt diagrams are displayed in figure 3 for the composite agns .",
    "the three panels correspond to the three different methods for classifying galaxies using two pairs of line ratios . in each panel ,",

    "the classification lines used to separate seyferts from liners are shown by dot - dashed lines .",
    "the size of each point is scaled to be proportional to the corresponding value of @xmath3 simply because of the high level of accuracy of this parameter ( see section 3.2 for details ) .    at first , almost all the composite agns are located between the theoretical and empirical lines in the [ ] /h@xmath1 vs. [ ] /h@xmath0 diagram , which indicates that our agn - host separations and emission - line measurements are consistent with those of mpa / jhu groups .",
    "in addition , it is interesting that the objects occupy a narrow vertical stripe with nearly constant line ratio [ ] /h@xmath0 .",
    "the examination of this phenomenon is out of the scope of this paper , and will be studied in subsequent works .",
    "moreover , no clear trend is found along this stripe for @xmath3 , although the objects with larger @xmath3 are only found at the top end of the stripe .",
    "in contrast , clear trends are found in the other two panels .",
    "the objects located in the occupations of liners generally have larger @xmath3 with respect to that located below the theoretical demarcation lines , which implies that the composite agns at least could be divided into two sub - groups : region - like ionization + young stellar population and liner - like ionization + old stellar population . and luminosity of [ ] instead of @xmath3 , with , however , less significance .",
    "]    since the composite agns are initially selected only from the [ ] /h@xmath0 vs. [ ] /h@xmath1 diagram , a more fine classification on the objects is performed as similar as done in kewley et al .",
    "we separate our sample into three groups according to the classification scheme described as follows : a ) the composite agns are galaxies that lie below the theoretical demarcation curves in all the [ ] /h@xmath0 , [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath0 diagrams .",
    "these galaxies correspond to the `` composite galaxies '' in kewley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ; b ) in contrast , the seyfert+liners are galaxies that lie above the theoretical demarcation curves in all the three diagrams ; c ) the remaining are multiply - classified galaxies that are classified differently in the three diagrams .",
    "these galaxies correspond to the case b `` ambiguous galaxies '' in kewley et al .",
    "the classification is shown in the three bpt diagrams in figure 4 .",
    "the demarcation lines are shown in the figure by the same symbols used in figure 3 .",
    "only 74 objects for which all the line ratios are determined are plotted .",
    "the composite agns , seyfert+liners and multiply - classified galaxies are shown by red , blue , and black points , respectively .",
    "our detailed classification indicates that , among the 74 objects , six ones can be classified as seyfert+liners rather than composites .",
    "the fraction of these six objects is so small that their existence has negligible effect on the overall properties of our sample .",
    "totally , there are 45 composite agns and 23 multiply - classified galaxies .",
    "the comparison in the age of stellar population between the composite agns and multiply - classified galaxies is illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "the dashed line shows distribution of @xmath3 for the composite agns , and the solid line for the multiply - classified galaxies .",
    "a narrow distribution with median value @xmath3=1.30 and standard deviation of 0.11 is found in the composite agns . on the contrary",
    ", a very wide and possibly bimodal distribution is identified in the multiply - classified galaxies .",
    "we plot our sample of the composite agns in the @xmath3/h@xmath66 plane in figure 6 .",
    "the dashed line shows the evolution of the standard ssp model with solar metallicity , and the dot - dashed line the evolution of the model with continuous star formation history ( i.e. , an exponentially declining sfr @xmath76 ) at solar metallicity ( bc03 ) . the @xmath3/h@xmath66 plane is a useful diagnosis to determine whether a galaxy has been forming stars continuously or in a recent burst .",
    "galaxies with continuous star formation history occupy a narrow locus in the plane .",
    "a recent burst ended in 0.1 - 1 gyrs ago results in a significant displacement away from the locus ( i.e. , be larger in h@xmath66 ) , because the optical spectrum is dominated by the emission of a type stars .",
    "even though the small discrepancy in h@xmath66 is found between our measures and those in mpa / jhu groups , the composite agns fall close to the model with continuous star formation history , except the object sdssj085338.27 + 033246.1 with significant strong h@xmath65 absorption h@xmath66=7.22 ( see section 3.2 for explanation ) .",
    "our sample allows us to investigate the issue of co - evolution of agn and star formation in a new approach .",
    "our study differs from the previous investigations in : 1 ) it should be emphasized that each composite agn certainly contains a seyfert 1 nucleus in its center , because of the existence of the broad h@xmath0 emission .",
    "in fact , there might be two populations of seyfert 2 galaxies : with and without a hidden seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "the spectropolarimetric surveys and x - ray observations indicate that the hidden seyfert 1 nuclei are indeed not present in a fraction ( 10%-50% ) of seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , tran 2001 , 2003 ; moran et al .",

    "; pappa et al .",
    "2001 ) ; 2 ) in addition , the basic properties of agn ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath77 ) are directly obtained from the nuclear emission rather than the tracers with large uncertainties .",
    "for instance , the luminosity of [ ] emission line is statistically used as a tracer of agn s bolometric luminosity in seyfert 2 galaxies by many authors ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a ; heckman et al .",
    "2004 ; kewley et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "it was suspected that @xmath4 might be of significance of `` age '' of agn ( e.g. , grupe et al . 1999 ; grupe 2004 ; wang et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to examine this point ,",
    "the @xmath4 vs. @xmath3 diagram is presented in the _ panel a in figure 7 .",
    "the diagram indicates that the @xmath4 estimated from the broad h@xmath0 emission varies as a function of the age of the host s stellar population .",
    "the black holes with high specific accretion rates tend to reside in the hosts with relatively young stellar populations .",
    "this dependence therefore strongly supports the evolutionary scenario of agn in which agns with high @xmath4 evolve to ones with low @xmath4 ( grupe 2004 ; wang et al .",
    "2006 ; wang & wei 2006 ) .",
    "the _ panel c in figure 7 shows a variation of the @xmath4 with the line ratio [ ] /h@xmath0 which is sensitive to the hardness of the ionizing field .",
    "as shown in the diagram , a soft ionizing spectrum tends to be associated with a relatively high @xmath4 on average , and a hard spectrum to be associated with an extremely low @xmath4 only .",
    "this trend is consistent with the strong correlation identified between the hardness of hard / soft x - ray emission and @xmath4 for both local and distant agns ( grupe 2004 ; bian 2005 ; shemmer et al .",
    "the lowest value of the @xmath4 among our sample is 0.003 , which is consistent with the prediction of the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model .",
    "the model can only produce sub - eddington accretions ( @xmath78 ) . because a large fraction of the energy released is advected with hot gas into black hole rather than radiated by emission , the gas is extremely hot , and produces a harder spectrum in a low state ( e.g. , abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; esin et al . 1997 ; meyer et al .",
    "2000 ; ferreira et al .",
    "_ _    the another candidate of `` age '' of agn is the accretion rate onto a black hole ( i.e. , luminosity released by accretion ) .",
    "relatively good relations are identified between @xmath79 and @xmath3 , and between @xmath79 and [ ] /h@xmath0 .",
    "the two relations are presented in figure 8 . noted that both relations degrade at the right - bottom end .",
    "this phenomenon does not appear when @xmath4 is used in place of @xmath79 as shown in the _ panel a and _ c in figure 7 , which indicates that the @xmath4 is the major physical driver in the evolution of agn . _ _    a significant correlation between @xmath3 and the line ratio [ ] /h@xmath0 is first shown in the _ panel b in figure 7 .",
    "the tight correlation implies that agn evolves from the high state with a soft spectrum to the low state with a hard spectrum .",
    "the line ratio [ ] /h@xmath0 is suggested to be used as a potential indicator of the age of stellar population . _",
    "in addition to the agn s contribution , other main mechanisms of the broad balmer emission lines are the stellar envelopes of wolf - rayet stars and ob associations associated multiple sn events ( izotov et al . 2007 and references therein )",
    ". both mechanisms can produce the broad emission lines with gaseous velocity as large as @xmath80 .",
    "the luminosity of the broad h@xmath0 emission line ranges from @xmath81 to @xmath82 in the composite agns , which greatly exceeds the typical luminosity of stellar winds from wr or lbv stars ( @xmath83-@xmath84 ) .",
    "moreover , the broad h@xmath0 emission in the composite agns is unlikely caused by the sn events , because of the existence of the underlying relatively old stellar populations in the spectra .",
    "the redshift ranges roughly from 0.05 to 0.15 in our sample . in this range of distance ,",
    "the typical projected fiber diameter ( @xmath85 ) is from @xmath86kpc to @xmath87kpc .",
    "when a spectrum is taken in the sdss spectroscopic survey , the fixed fiber aperture would result in more contamination of the light emitted from the outer part of host galaxy in distant galaxies than in nearby galaxies .",
    "first , the effect leads the liner fraction decreases with redshift because the weak emission lines are more difficult to be detected in distant galaxies than in nearby galaxies .",
    "such effect exists in our sample , and is shown in the left panel in figure 9 .",
    "the fraction of the liner - like galaxies with an old stellar population drops significantly when redshift @xmath88 , which is consistent with kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and kewley et al .",
    "secondly , for a fixed aperture , as the contamination increases with redshift , the value of @xmath3 would increase with redshift if a circumnuclear starburst occurs .",
    "if so , one could see a lower boundary with positive slope in the @xmath3 vs. z diagram , which is , however , not present in the diagram .",
    "the aperture effect can not explain why no young stellar populations ( @xmath89 ) is deteced in the low - redshift galaxies .",
    "the negative trend shown in the diagram could be explained by the consequence of the increase of @xmath34 with the redshift .",
    "moreover , the lower limit of redshift of @xmath90 ensures that the spectra taken within @xmath85 aperture could approximately reflect the global properties ( kewley et al .",
    "the right panel in figure 9 shows the broad - to - narrow h@xmath0 line ratio as a function of the redshift . as shown by the diagram , in general , our criterion for the existence of the broad h@xmath0 line is free of the aperture effect .      in section 4 ,",
    "we have built a sub - sample of the composite agns which are below the theoretical demarcation lines in the three bpt diagrams .",
    "the left panel in figure 10 shows the [ ] / [ ] vs. [ ] /h@xmath0 diagram for the composite agns .",
    "the distribution shows that the composite agns lie within the occupation of the star - forming galaxies , which additionally suggests that hot stars might be main contributor of the ionizing field for the narrow emission lines .",
    "the luminosity of [ ] emission line is an indicator of current star formation rate ( sfr ) for regions as suggested by kennicutt ( 1998 ) and kewley et al .",
    "however , the origin of the [ ] emission is complex in the composite agns , since both agn and starburst can contribute to [ ] ( e.g. , kim et al .",
    "2006 ; yan et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to estimate the contribution by agn ,",
    "the right panel in figure 10 shows the luminosity of [ ] as a function of the line ration [ ] / [ ] .",

    "the composite agns clearly show enhanced [ ] / [ ] ratios . similar as done in kim et al .",

    "then , on average , @xmath775 percent of the [ ] emission is estimated to come from star formation in the composite agns .",

    "a correlation between the current sfrs and @xmath4 is shown in the _ left panel in figure 11 .",
    "the relatively large scatter could be caused by both the underestimation of @xmath34 and the contribution of agn to @xmath98}}$ ] .",
    "the correlation indicates that a more powerful agn tends to be associated with a more intense current star formation .",
    "the relation is reasonable because the strengths of both agn and star - forming activities depend on the consumption of gas .",
    "heckman et al . ( 2004 ) found a roughly constant ratio of the star formation rate to the accretion rate onto black hole in the sdss survey .",
    "the dependence of the sfr on the luminosity of agn is further supported by the correlation , between the x - ray luminosity in 0.5 - 4.5 kev band and co luminosity , found in seyfert 1 galaxies and in quasars ( yamada 1994 ) .",
    "the _ middle and _ right panels in figure 11 shows variations of the sfrs with @xmath3 and h@xmath66 , respectively . as shown by the diagrams , the current sfr decreases when stellar populations passively evolves , because of the depletion of the gas .",
    "both relations are consistent with figure 6 in which a continuous star formation history with an exponentially decaying sfr is required to match the observations to the modeled evolution locus .",
    "in addition , the [ ] inferred sfrs are typically below 10@xmath99 .",
    "the suppressed current sfrs are identified in a number of luminous agns by several authors ( e.g. , ho 2005b ; kim et al .",

    "after a starburst occurs first and triggers accretion onto the central black hole latter , agn then shines with decreasing @xmath4 and insignificant increasing black hole mass , as the young stellar population ages and fades .",

    "<S> taking advantage of these galaxies , the properties of both components can be studied together by direct measurements . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on the broad - line composite galaxies ( composite agns ) which are located between the theoretical and empirical separation lines in the [ ] /h@xmath0 vs. [ ] /h@xmath1 diagram . these galaxies are searched for from the composite galaxies provided by the sdss dr4 mpa / jhu catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> after re - analyze the spectra , we perform a fine classification for the 85 composite agns in terms of the bpt diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> all the objects located below the three theoretical separation lines are associated with a young stellar population ( @xmath21gyrs ) , while either a young or old stellar population is identified in the individual multiply - classified object . </S>",
    "<S> the multiply - classified objects with a very old stellar population are located in the liner region in the [ ] /h@xmath0 vs. [ ] /h@xmath1 diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the connection between agn and star formation to derive the key results . </S>",
    "<S> the eddington ratio inferred from the broad h@xmath0 emission , the age of the stellar population of agn s host as assessed by @xmath3 , and the line ratio [ ] /h@xmath0 are found to be related with each other . </S>",
    "<S> these relations strongly support the evolutionary scenario in which agns evolve from high @xmath4 state with soft spectrum to low @xmath4 state with hard spectrum as young stellar population ages and fades . the significant correlation between the line ratio [ ] </S>",
    "<S> /h@xmath0 and @xmath3 leads us to suggest that the line ratio could be used to trace the age of stellar population in type i agns . </S>"
