    "a fundamental property of quantum information is that it can not be copied , in contrast with information we are used to in classical physics .",
    "this means that there exists no physical process that can produce perfect copies of a system that is initially in an _ unknown _ quantum state .",
    "this so - called _ no - cloning _ theorem , recognized by dieks  @xcite and wootters and zurek  @xcite , is an immediate consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics , and lies at the heart of quantum theory .",
    "remarkably , if cloning _ was _ permitted , the heisenberg uncertainty principle could then be violated by measuring conjugate observables on many copies of a single quantum system . nevertheless , even if _ perfect _ quantum cloning is precluded by the uncertainty principle , it is possible to devise a cloning machine that yields _ imperfect _ copies of the original quantum state , that is , the cloning process necessarily introduces errors .",
    "quantum cloning machines have recently attracted a lot of attention because of their use in connection with quantum communication and cryptography ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "to fix the ideas , consider a cloning machine that duplicates a two - state system ( a quantum bit or a qubit ) that is initially in an arbitrary state @xmath8 whose amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are unknown .",
    "it is easy to build a cloning machine that perfectly copies the two basis states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , but then it badly duplicates the superpositions @xmath13 . in other words , it can not produce perfect copies of _ all _ possible input states simultaneously .",
    "this being so , we may ask how well one can _ approximately _ duplicate the unknown state of the qubit if the quality of the copies is required to be independent of the input state",
    ". this question has been answered by buzek and hillery  @xcite who first showed that it is possible to construct a cloning machine that yields two imperfect copies of a single qubit in state @xmath14 . specifically , they defined a universal cloning machine ( ucm ) which creates two identical copies of @xmath14 characterized each by the same density operator @xmath15 .",
    "this machine is called _ universal _ because it produces copies that are _ state - independent _ : the fidelity of cloning @xmath16 does not depend on the input state .",
    "equivalently , the two output qubits of the ucm can be viewed as emerging from a depolarizing channel of probability 1/4 , that is , a channel whose errors are _ isotropic _ ( the bloch vector characterizing the state @xmath14 is shrunk by a factor 2/3 regardless its orientation ) .",
    "the ucm was later proved to be optimal by bruss et al .",
    "@xcite and gisin and massar  @xcite when the quality of a cloner is measured by the fidelity @xmath17 .",
    "the concept of approximate cloning was also extended by gisin and massar who considered optimal @xmath18-to-@xmath19 cloners , which produce @xmath18 imperfect copies from @xmath19 identical original qubits .",
    "more recently , the optimal cloning of quantum bits was generalized to quantum systems of arbitrary dimensions by buzek and hillery  @xcite ( @xmath20-to-@xmath21 universal cloner ) , and werner  @xcite ( @xmath18-to-@xmath19 optimal cloners ) .",
    "zanardi  @xcite also discussed a group - theoretical analysis of @xmath18-to-@xmath19 optimal cloners for pure states of arbitrary dimension .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a family of _ asymmetric _ cloning machines that produce two non - identical ( approximate ) copies of the state of an @xmath0-dimensional quantum system .",
    "this is in contrast with the cloning machines considered so far , which are symmetric ( the copies being identical , or characterized by the same density operator ) .",
    "the two copies created by our cloners emerge from quantum channels that are defined with a basis of @xmath22 error operators on @xmath0-dimensional inputs that form a heisenberg group ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to these channels as _ heisenberg _ channels , and the corresponding cloners as _ heisenberg _ cloning machines ( hcm ) .",
    "a heisenberg channel is characterized by the @xmath22-dimensional probability distribution of the error operators that the quantum state undergoes in the channel . using a particular class of _ isotropic _ asymmetric hcms , i.e. , cloners",
    "whose outputs emerge from ( distinct ) depolarizing channels , we derive a _ no - cloning inequality _ governing the tradeoff between the quality of the copies of a single @xmath0-dimensional state imposed by quantum mechanics : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the depolarizing fractions of the channels associated with outputs @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "it is a tight inequality for all isotropic cloning machines , which is saturated with the hcms .",
    "this ellipse in ( @xmath28)-space tends to a circle when copying @xmath0-dimensional states with @xmath29 , which has a simple semi - classical interpretation . more generally , the complementarity between the two copies produced by an anisotropic hcm is shown to result from a genuine _ uncertainty principle _ , much like that associated with fourier transforms . accordingly",
    ", the probability distributions @xmath30 and @xmath31 characterizing the heisenberg channels leading to the two outputs of the cloner can not be peaked simultaneously , giving rise to a balance between the quality of the copies .",
    "this can be expressed by an entropic no - cloning uncertainty relation , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 stands for the shannon entropy .    in section  [ sect_qubits ] , we discuss the asymmetric cloning of two - dimensional quantum states , in order to prepare the grounds of the extension to @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we introduce a _",
    "cloning machine ( pcm )  @xcite , which produces two ( generally non - identical ) output qubits , each emerging from a _",
    "pauli _ channel .",
    "a pauli channel is a special case ( @xmath34 ) of a heisenberg channel which is defined by the four - element group of error operators for qubits , generated by the bit / phase flip errors ( see sec .",
    "[ sect_paulichannel ] ) .",
    "the family of pcms relies on a parametrization of 4-qubit wave functions for which all qubit pairs are in a mixture of bell states .",
    "the resulting no - cloning uncertainty relation for qubits is discussed .",

    ", we generalize the pauli cloning machine to systems of arbitrary dimensions , and define a family of asymmetric heisenberg cloning machines for @xmath0-dimensional states .",
    "our description is based on the @xmath22 maximally - entangled states of two @xmath0-dimensional systems which generalize the bell states , and the corresponding heisenberg group of error operators in @xmath0 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the family of asymmetric hcms is used to investigate the complementarity principle governing the tradeoff between the quality of the copies .",
    "the optimal @xmath0-dimensional ucm  @xcite is shown to be a special case ( symmetric and isotropic ) of these cloners .",
    "consider a quantum bit in an arbitrary state @xmath8 which is processed by a pauli channel  @xcite .",
    "a pauli channel is defined using the group of four error operators ( the three pauli matrices @xmath42 and the identity @xmath43 ) , namely it acts on state @xmath14 by either rotating it by one of the pauli matrices or leaving it unchanged .",
    "specifically , the input qubit undergoes a phase - flip ( @xmath44 ) , a bit - flip ( @xmath45 ) , or their combination ( @xmath46 ) with respective probabilities @xmath6 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , or remains unchanged with probability @xmath47 .",
    "a depolarizing channel corresponds to the special case where @xmath48 .",
    "it is very convenient to describe the operation of a pauli channel by considering an input qubit @xmath49 maximally entangled with a reference qubit @xmath50 . indeed",
    ", a remarkable property of entanglement is that by applying a unitary transformation on just one qubit of a two - qubit system , one can transform a maximally - entangled joint state into another .",
    "denoting the four maximally - entangled states of two qubits ( or bell states ) as @xmath51 , yields the three remaining bell states , namely and @xmath52 . ]",
    "@xmath53 therefore , if the input qubit @xmath49 of the pauli channel is maximally entangled with a reference qubit @xmath50 that is unchanged while @xmath49 is processed by the channel , say if their joint state is @xmath54 then the joint state of @xmath50 and the output @xmath55 is a mixture of the four bell states @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "this bell mixture uniquely characterizes the pauli channel since the weights of the bell states are simply the probabilities associated with the four error operators .",
    "this alternate description of a pauli channel based on bell mixtures happens to be very useful when considering quantum cloning machines .",
    "a simple correspondence rule can be written relating an arbitrary mixture of bell state and the associated operation on a qubit @xmath14 by a pauli channel .",
    "start from the bell mixture @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 stand for the three remaining bell states ranked by increasing weight .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the operation on an arbitrary state @xmath14 performed by the corresponding channel is @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the time - reversed of state @xmath14 .",
    "the four components on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq_arbitrarychannel ] ) correspond respectively to the unchanged , ( rotated ) time - reversed , rotated , and random fractions .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq_arbitrarychannel ] ) that the operation of the channel is _ state - independent _ only if @xmath64 , that is , if the time - reversed and rotated fractions vanish .",
    "then , we have a _ depolarizing _ channel of probability @xmath65 , i. e. , @xmath66 is a werner state and eq .",
    "( [ eq_arbitrarychannel ] ) becomes @xmath67 thus , the qubit is replaced by a random bit with probability @xmath68 and left unchanged otherwise .",
    "the quantity @xmath69 is named the _ depolarizing fraction_. equivalently , the vector characterizing the input qubit in the bloch sphere is shrunk by a _ scaling factor _ @xmath70 regardless its orientation , so that the fidelity of the channel , @xmath71 , is independent of the input state .",
    "other channels are necessarily _ state - dependent_. for example , the `` 2-pauli '' channel of probability @xmath65 ( i.e. , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) performs the operation @xmath74 while the dephasing channel of probability @xmath65 ( i.e. , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) simply gives @xmath77      we define an _ asymmetric _ pauli cloning machine as a machine whose two outputs , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , emerge from distinct pauli channels  @xcite .",
    "thus , if the input @xmath49 of the cloner is fully entangled with a reference @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath78 , the density operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 must then be mixtures of bell states .",
    "focusing on the first output @xmath26 , we see that a 4-dimensional additional hilbert space is necessary in general to `` purify '' @xmath79 since we need to accommodate its four ( generally nonzero ) eigenvalues .",
    "results from the partial trace of a pure state in an extended hilbert space , this space must be 16-dimensional as a consequence of schmidt decomposition  @xcite . ]",
    "the 2-dimensional space of the second output qubit @xmath27 is thus insufficient for this purpose , so that we must introduce a single additional qubit @xmath40 , which may be viewed as an ancilla or the cloning machine itself .",
    "the fact that a 2-dimensional space is sufficient for @xmath40 is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite for the ucm , and we conjecture that this holds for the pcm ( this is justified a posteriori by the work of niu and griffiths  @xcite ) . as a consequence , we are led to consider a 4-qubit system in order to fully describe the pcm , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig_cloner ] .",
    "the qubits @xmath50 and @xmath49 are initially in the entangled state @xmath81 , the two auxiliary qubits being in a prescribed state , e.g. , @xmath11 . after cloning , the four qubits @xmath50 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath40 are in a pure state for which @xmath79 and @xmath80 are mixtures of bell states ( i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 emerge from a pauli channel ) .",
