    "the nature of compressible states at @xmath4 filling fraction in the fractional quantum hall regime has been a fascinating topic since the pioneering work by halperin , lee , and read ( hlr )  @xcite . in the hlr picture",
    "this state is interpreted as a liquid of non - relativisitc composite fermions(cfs ) coupled to a fluctuating chern - simons ( cs ) gauge field .",
    "it provides a nice explanation for the experimental observations of acoustic wave propagation  @xcite and has been further supported by other measurements  @xcite .",
    "however , the hlr theory has a long - standing issue in that it is incompatible with the particle - hole symmetry defined for a single landau level  @xcite in the zero landau level mixing limit . according to ref .",
    ", the particle - hole symmetry requires the hall conductivity of electrons in a half filled landau level to be exactly @xmath5 . from this",
    "it can be deduced that the hall conductivity of the composite fermion liquid needs to be equal to @xmath6 .",
    "this contradicts the hlr picture where the composite fermions feel zero magnetic field at mean field level and therefore @xmath7 .",
    "considering fluctuations of the cs gauge fields beyond the mean field level can lead to a nonzero @xmath8 ; however , it is small and can not explain the large value of @xmath9 .",
    "experimentally the measured @xmath10 is very close to @xmath11  @xcite , and the emergent particle - hole symmetry has also been supported by several experiments  @xcite . therefore these experimental results contradict the hlr picture , which apparently breaks the particle - hole symmetry .    to resolve this issue recently son  @xcite",
    "has proposed a particle - hole symmetric theory in which the underlying composite fermions are taken to be dirac particles . as in the hlr picture , these dirac cfs are electrically neutral and coupled to an emergent gauge field . however , in this new picture the emergent gauge field does not have a chern - simons term .",
    "this proposal has sparked a great deal of interest  @xcite because it can not only resolve the old particle - hole symmetry issue but also provide another avenue to study some seemingly completely unrelated topics such as strongly - correlated topological insulator surface states  @xcite .",
    "cooper pairing of the cfs gives rise to incompressible gapped states , which can possess nonabelian braiding statistics  @xcite and are potentially useful for topological quantum computation  @xcite . in the traditional hlr picture , pairing cfs can lead to the moore - read pfaffian state  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the lack of the particle - hole symmetry , the anti - pfaffian state  @xcite the particle - hole conjugate of the moore - read pfaffian state is impossible .",
    "in contrast , in the new dirac cf theory both the moore - read pfaffian and anti - pfaffian states are put on equal footing .",
    "furthermore , a new putative particle - hole symmetric pairing state  @xcite has also been proposed .",
    "however , the possible underlying pairing mechanism for realizing these states is not clear at all .",
    "in fact , in a recent work  @xcite the authors there considered an effective interaction , derived from the original electron - electron coulomb interaction , in the bcs pairing channel and found that there is no pairing instability in any angular momentum channel @xmath0 .",
    "here we pursue an idea proposed in ref   and applied to the hlr problem  @xcite by our group previously .",
    "we construct a specific paring mechanism for the new dirac cf theory .",
    "this mechanism is similar to kohn - luttinger s mechanism  @xcite in the sense that in both cases the instability results from a repulsive force .",
    "however , they are different in two respects : ( 1 ) in our mechanism a finite coupling constant is required to achieve the pairing state , while in kohn - luttinger s case even an infinitesimal interaction can trigger the pairing instability ; ( 2)our new pairing mechanism takes advantage of the attraction in matsubara frequency domain due to a dynamic screening from the finite density of fermions ; while kohn - luttinger s idea is to take advantage of the spatial part of attraction due to a static screening .    applying the mechanism of dynamic screening ,",
    "we show that there can be nonzero pairing of dirac cfs in angular momentum channels @xmath12 , including the moore - read pfaffian and the anti - pfaffian states , which correspond to the @xmath13 channels .",
    "there is a quantum phase transition from the dirac cf liquid state to the @xmath2 pairing states as we tune the effective coupling constant .",
