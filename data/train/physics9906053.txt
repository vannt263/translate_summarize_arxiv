    "under the influence of an intensive electromagnetic field an atom can emit electrons and photons .",
    "the number of photons absorbed from the field in the first process generally can exceed the minimum necessary for ionization resulting in distribution of the photoelectrons over the above threshold ionization ( ati ) channels .",
    "the photon production manifests itself as the harmonics generation ( hg ) for the incident monochromatic laser radiation .",
    "both ati and hg are capable of populating the channels with remarkably high energy , as has recently been registered in experiments ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) and tackled by the theory @xcite ( the list of references is unavoidably incomplete , for more bibliography see the reviews @xcite ) .    an idea that the two processes referred above are interrelated was articulated long ago .",
    "since in the hg process an active electron ends up in the initial bound state , it is appealing to represent it as ionization followed by recombination .",
    "this mechanism presumes a strong interaction between the emitted electron and the core that is omitted in the standard keldysh @xcite model of multiphoton ionization .",
    "the importance of this interaction was first pointed out by kuchiev @xcite , who predicted several phenomena for which the electron - core interaction plays a crucial role .",
    "the related mechanism was named _ `` atomic antenna''_.    specifically for hg , the simple relation between this process and ati was suggested by eberly _",
    "et al _ @xcite but proved to be non - realistic , see below .",
    "the hybrid classical - quantum model due to corkum @xcite ( see also the paper by kulander _ et al _ @xcite ) casts hg as a three - step process : tunneling ionization and subsequent propagation in the continuum is completed by recombination .",
    "this intuitive model has influenced many research in experiment and theory .",
    "the simplicity of the model is due to some drastic presumptions .",
    "usually it is emphasized that the intermediate electron propagation in the laser field is described by the corkum @xcite model classically .",
    "probably less attention is paid to the fact that neither the tunneling ionization through the time - dependent barrier , nor the laser - stimulated recombination receive a genuine quantum treatment as well .",
    "being successfully applied to the comparison with some experimental data , the model resorts to such a loosely defined free parameter as the transverse spread of the electron wave function. from the conceptual side the corkum @xcite model does not appeal to ati process just because the discrete ati channels do not appear within the classical framework .",
    "the subsequent theoretical developments were based on more sophisticated approaches and led to important advancements @xcite , but apparently abandoned a perspective to establish a quantitative relation between ati and hg .",
    "the ati characteristics merely do not emerge in the papers devoted to hg theory , with few exceptions @xcite .",
    "for instance , ref.@xcite establishes what the authors think to be the most general formal relation between ionization and high harmonic generation that contains functional derivative of the ground state persistence amplitude @xmath1 but not ati amplitude . as the authors recognize , this relation is of limited practical use since it requires knowledge of @xmath1 for _ arbitrary _ electric field @xmath2 .",
    "theoretically hg is governed by the fourier components in the field - dresses wave function .",
    "the proper description of the high - order components is a challenging task for the theory .",
    "although some important features could be understood in classical calculations , the significance of fully quantum quantitative theory could not be overestimated .",
    "the computer - intensive numerical studies achieved substantial progress @xcite , but the available computer facilities often limit them to the one - dimensional models @xcite . they could be favorably complemented by analytical studies capable of providing an important physical insight . however , with the two different analytic quantum approaches being developed recently @xcite , the problem could not yet be considered as closed .",
    "for instance , as far as we know , these two approaches have never been applied to the same system in order to provide quantitative comparison of their results , albeit the differences in the formulation were indicated by becker _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the only exception known to us is provided by ref .",
    "@xcite where in fig .",
    "6 some comparison is presented , albeit not for such a basic characteristics as hg rates , but for harmonic ellipticity and offset angle that reflect rather subtle peculiarities of hg process . for the offset angle",
    "a severe disagreement between the two theories is demonstrated .",
    "the lack of comparison looks quite typical to the current state of theory when the attention is mostly directed towards the qualitative aspects of the problem such as description of the pattern of emitted harmonic spectrum .",
    "the principal objective of the present study is to derive a fully quantum formulation for the hg amplitude in terms of the ati amplitude and the amplitude of electron laser assisted recombination ( lar ) in the laser field .",
    "importantly , all the amplitudes are physical , i.e. no off - energy - shell entities appear .",
    "this circumstance adds to the conceptual appeal of the present theory its significance as a true working tool . in our approach , briefly described in the letter to editor @xcite , we base on the ideas outlined @xcite and later developed in more detail @xcite by kuchiev .",
    "we successfully test its efficiency by comparison with the benchmark calculations by becker _",
    "@xcite for hg by h@xmath0 ion .",
    "it should be emphasized that we test and achieve quantitative agreement for absolute values of hg rates , in contrast to many theoretical works which concentrate mostly on the qualitative issues .",
    "the quantitative character of our development is further illustrated by comparative calculations within the dipole - length and dipole - velocity gauges for the emitted high - energy photons : the good agreement testifies in favor of the method . in the broader perspective",
    "it should be emphasized that our theoretical technique is directly applicable to other processes of current key interest , such as multiple ionization by laser radiation or enhanced population of high ati channels due to the photoelectron rescattering on the atomic core .",
    "we start ( sec.[sec2 ] ) with exposure of the general relations and outline our basic approximations .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we cast the harmonic generation amplitude as a sum over contributions coming from different ati channels .",
    "the form and interpretation of this representation becomes particularly transparent when we resort to the adiabatic approximation ( sec.[secad ] ) .",
    "the general theory is illustrated by the quantitative results in section [ sec5 ] that is followed by the concluding discussion ( sec.[sec6 ] ) .",
    "the generation of a harmonic with the frequency @xmath3 is governed by the fourier transform of the dipole transition matrix element @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are initial and final states of the atomic system dressed by the laser field ( atomic units are used throughout the paper ) .",
    "we construct the initial field - dressed state @xmath5 @xmath7 developed out the initial field - free stationary state @xmath8 @xmath9 using the retarded green function @xmath10 which obeys equation @xmath11 g ( { \\bf r } , t ; \\ , { \\bf r}^\\prime , t^\\prime ) & = & \\delta ( t - t^\\prime ) \\ ,   \\delta({\\bf r } - { \\bf r}^\\prime )   \\hspace{10 mm } ( t > t^\\prime ) ~ ,   \\nonumber \\\\ g ( { \\bf r } , t ; \\ , { \\bf r}^\\prime , t^\\prime ) & = & 0 \\hspace{10 mm } ( t < t^\\prime ) ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of an atomic system in the single active electron approximation , @xmath13 is the interaction with the core , @xmath14 is the interaction with the laser field that generally includes the field - switching effects [ below we presume that @xmath15 is real ] .",
    "we consider harmonic generation when the atomic system ends up in the initial state .",
    "other final states are also feasible , but till now this possibility have not been explored neither in the experiment , nor in the theory . in this case",
    "the final state tends to @xmath16 for @xmath17 being presented similarly to ( [ wfg ] ) as @xmath18 employing ( [ wfg ] ) and ( [ wff ] ) we transform @xmath19 to @xmath20 where @xmath21 notation is employed to represent integration over the space variables .",
    "this formula could be compared with eq .",
    "( 2.15 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained under presumption @xmath22 . although the general structure is similar , the important difference lies in the range of temporal integration . in formula ( [ dex ] )",
    "the first term in the right hand side turns zero for the inversion - invariant ( for instance , spherically symmetric ) potentials .",
    "physically the second term describes the process when the high harmonic photon is emitted _ after _ the interaction with the laser field , @xmath23 , whereas the third term describes the time - reversed event in which the radiation _ precedes _ the absorption of laser quanta .",
    "we denote the second and the third terms respectively as @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,    @xmath26    the last term in ( [ dex ] ) includes the effect usually referred to as _ continuum - continuum transitions",
    "in the present outlook it corresponds to the `` mixed '' picture when a part of laser photons is absorbed prior to emission of the harmonic followed by absorption of missing low - energy quanta .    in this paper",
    "the continuum - continuum transitions are omitted as a rather standard approach , apparently assumed originally in refs .",
    "@xcite , albeit never scrutinized",
    ". there exists a simple physical reason why this term should not be important .",
    "the absorption of large number of low - frequency quanta happens when the active electron is well separated from an atom , see discussion of the role of large distances in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , one should anticipate that emission of the high - energy quantum occurs when the electron is localized close to the atom .",
    "a transition of the electron from the outer region to the vicinity of the atom inevitably produces a suppression factor that describes the electron propagation .",
    "later on it will be considered in detail , see the factor @xmath27 in ( [ ma ] ) . for a _",
    "natural _ sequence of events , when electron first absorbs @xmath28 laser quanta and then emits the high - harmonic this suppression factor appears only once . for continuum - continuum transitions the electron has to go from the outer region into the vicinity of the atom thrice , that induces appearance of three suppression factors ,",
    "thus substantially reducing the amplitude .",
    "technically the explicit calculation of the continuum - continuum contribution means substantially higher level of difficulty , since it contains _ two _ green functions ; it is not pursued in the present study .",
    "an alternative , albeit indirect justification for omission of continuum - continuum contribution could be seen in the fact that our calculations of hg rates within this approximation are in a good _ quantitative _ agreement ( sec.[sec5 ] ) with the results obtained by becker _",
    "et al _ who apparently do not rely on it .",
    "one more argument in favor of this approximation stems from the fact that it provides a very good agreement between the results in length and velocity gauges , as detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] .",
    "further we presume that the monochromatic laser field @xmath29 is switched on adiabatically at some remote time ( @xmath30 is the amplitude of the electric field strength in the laser wave ) . in this case",
    "one can easily check that @xmath31 . after dropping in the right hand side of ( [ dex ] ) the last term , that describes the continuum - continuum transitions , we arrive to the formula @xmath32 one should remember that in our calculations according to ( [ wfg ] ) and ( [ wff ] ) we employed _ different wave functions _ @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , there is a strong trend in the literature @xcite ( to cite only part of references ) to presume that @xmath33 that leads to replacement of the relation ( [ dpm ] ) by @xmath34 and , consequently , to the real - valued dipole momentum @xmath19 .",
    "contrary to this almost universal delusion the expression ( [ dwrong ] ) is incorrect for description of harmonic emission by a single atom and the dipole momentum @xmath19 _ is not _ real - valued , both in the exact formulation ( [ dex ] ) and within the approximation neglecting the continuum - continuum transitions ( [ dpm ] ) .",
    "the recent paper on the unified theory of harmonic generation by becker _",
    "@xcite describes two different approaches .",
    "the calculations of the dipole - moment expectation presume @xmath22 and lead to the real - valued @xmath19 [ see eqs .  (",
    "2.15 ) and ( 2.16 ) in @xcite ] , whereas the @xmath35-matrix approach accounts for the distinction between @xmath6 and @xmath5 and provides a similar formula ( 2.30 ) but with a different range of temporal integration [ cf .",
    "our discussion below eq .",
    "( [ dex ] ) ] .",
    "the mentioned formula ( 2.30 ) gives complex - valued results .",
    "we agree with the authors comment that the @xmath35-matrix approach is to be employed when the harmonic emission of a single atom is considered ; namely this process is the subject of our present study .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite as well as refs .",
    "@xcite carry out all calculations for the dipole moment expectation presuming that just this quantity is required as a source term for the integration of the maxwell equations when the emission by the medium is considered .",
    "we believe that the theory of collective emission should be ultimately based on the proper description of a single atom process , but further discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper . for the high harmonic generation the time - reversed process described by @xmath36 , i.e. emission of high harmonics followed by absorption of a large number of the laser quanta ,",
    "is strongly suppressed as compared with the _ `` natural '' _ sequence of events represented by @xmath24 , i.e. when at first a large number of laser quanta is gained and subsequently one high - frequency photon is emitted .",
    "therefore the further approximation of eq.([dpm ] ) @xmath37 should work well . below",
    "( sec.[sec5 ] ) we demonstrate by explicit calculation of the fourier components that indeed the term @xmath25 gives negligible contribution .    for monochromatic laser filed ( [ vf ] ) @xmath19 is a periodic function of time with the period @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the laser frequency . introducing the fourier",
    "transform @xmath40 we see that @xmath41 this _ stationary _ picture does not account for the depletion of the initial state by the laser - induced transitions . to describe this effect one could employ for @xmath5 and @xmath6 the quasi - energy states with complex - valued quasienergies",
    "; however we do not resort to this complication below ( another method to account for the depletion effects was suggested by lewenstein _ et al _ @xcite ) .",
    "thus the problem under consideration is reduced to calculation of the finite fourier transform @xmath42 ( [ dn ] ) .",
    "one readily notices that @xmath43 and therefore @xmath44 whereas ( [ dwrong ] ) leads to the distinct result @xmath45 as discussed above , for high harmonic generation we anticipate that @xmath46 .",
    "if the term @xmath47 is negligible , then the formulae ( [ dnmn ] ) and ( [ dnmnwrong ] ) agree .",
    "the quantitative assessment for the quality of this approximation could be found in sec.[sec5 ] .",
    "our basic approximation is to neglect the effect of the atomic core potential @xmath48 in the time - propagator @xmath49 .",

    "this transformation amounts to some special representation of the time - dependent green function , since ( [ mgr ] ) can be considered as its generalized matrix element .    generally speaking the correct description of the high fourier components @xmath42 represents a formidable theoretical task .",
    "its numerical implementation via solving the non - stationary schrdinger equation requires both a supercomputer and exceptional effort . in representation ( [ mgr ] )",
    "the difficulty lies in the strong variation of the integrand as a function of the time variables @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the application of the asymptotic technique is hindered by the fact that in expression ( [ mgr ] ) the integration variables are not independent : namely , the limit of @xmath63-integration depends on @xmath62 .",

    "first of all note that integration over the variables @xmath84 , @xmath85 is localized in the vicinity of the atom .",
    "the characteristic atomic dimensions should be compared with the amplitude @xmath86 of the electron wiggling in the laser field ( the latter motion being described by @xmath87 ) .",
    "this amplitude becomes large even for quite moderate electric fields @xmath88 note that this inequality may be satisfied both for large ( @xmath89 ) as well as small ( @xmath90 ) values of the keldysh adiabaticity parameter @xmath91 .",

    "note that the denominator @xmath101 in ( [ facrr ] ) can turn zero thus challenging convergence of integrals .",

    "now we return to the time - dependent bound state wave function @xmath103 and volkov states @xmath50 bearing in mind relation ( [ kmnm ] ) .",
    "this gives us an appealing representation : @xmath104      an interpretation of formula ( [ mpref ] ) is based on the fact that the integrand is a product of physically meaningful factors . in order to recognize the first of them one should recall that the amplitude of @xmath78-photon detachment of electron from the initial state @xmath8 within the keldysh @xcite approximation is given by @xmath105 generally , the number @xmath78 of photons absorbed is larger than a minimum necessary for the electron detachment , therefore the process corresponds to the above threshold ionization ( ati ) . in the right hand side of ( [ akeld ] )",

    "we confirm that @xmath110 is exactly the physical translational electron momentum in the @xmath78-th ati channel .",
    "the second relevant process is that of laser assisted recombination ( lar ) when the continuum electron with the momentum @xmath106 collides with an atom in the laser field .",
    "the electron absorbs some extra laser quanta and goes to the bound state @xmath8 emitting single photon of frequency @xmath3 . in the keldysh - type approximation",
    "this lar process has the amplitude @xmath111 it could be called also _ laser - induced recombination_. the allowed values of the high - energy photon frequency @xmath3 are @xmath112 with integer @xmath78 .",
    "one readily notices that the integrand in ( [ mpref ] ) bears a striking resemblance to the product of the integrands in ( [ akeld ] ) and ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "this allows us to interpret the amplitude ( [ mpref ] ) as describing the two - step transition : at first the electron goes to the laser - field dressed continuum ( volkov ) state @xmath113 after absorption of @xmath78 photons ; at the second step it returns to the initial state emitting single photon with the frequency @xmath61 .",
    "note that the intermediate momentum @xmath114 is restricted not only in magnitude ( [ kmnm ] ) but also in direction : according to eq.([kff ] ) the vector @xmath99 is parallel or anti - parallel to the electric vector @xmath30 in the laser wave .",
    "the physical implications of this circumstance are discussed in the next section .",
    "there is an extra factor @xmath115 in the integrand of ( [ mpref ] ) which prevents complete separation of integrations in @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in fact its presence is physically well understandable .",
    "indeed , the definition of @xmath116 ( [ r12 ] ) shows that classically it is the distance between the electron positions at the moments @xmath62 and @xmath63 with account for the electron wiggling in the laser field .",
    "@xmath27 could be named an _ expansion factor _ since in the absence of the laser field ( @xmath117 ) it describes conventional decrease of the amplitude in a spherical wave as it expands in 3d space ( @xmath118 ) . when the laser field is operative ,",
    "the form of the expansion factor is drastically modified according to the approximation ( [ r0tt ] ) .",
    "hence the interpretation of the expression ( [ mpref ] ) is that the electron first is transferred to the @xmath78-th ati channel , then propagates in space under the influence of the laser wave and finally recombines to the initial state emitting the photon with the frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the contribution of each path is labeled by the number of virtually absorbed photons @xmath78 .",
    "these contributions add up coherently as shown by eq.([mfin ] ) .",
    "for the actual ati process the momentum @xmath110 should be real .",
    "the summation in ( [ mfin ] ) includes also the virtual processes with the imaginary values of @xmath110 , but their contribution is anticipated to be small .",
    "it is worthwhile now to outline equivalent but more convenient representation of ati and lar amplitudes .",
    "bearing in mind the character of @xmath84-dependence of volkov states ( [ volkov])-([chi ] ) it is easy to see that the space integration in the formulae ( [ akeld ] ) or ( [ rec ] ) essentially reduces to the fourier transformation .",
    "for instance , as shown in much detail by gribakin and kuchiev @xcite , the ati amplitude ( [ akeld ] ) is exactly presented as @xmath119 \\tilde{\\phi}_a \\left ( { \\bf p } + { \\bf k}_t",
    "\\right ) \\exp \\left [ i s(t ) \\right ] ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the classical action @xmath121 @xmath122 is the fourier transform of @xmath123 : @xmath124 similarly , for the lar amplitude one obtains @xmath125 \\right\\ } \\ : \\tilde{\\phi}_a^{({\\mbox { \\boldmath $ \\epsilon$ } } ) }   \\left ( - { \\bf k}_m - { \\bf k}_t \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath126    before concluding this section it is worthwhile to make an important observation .",
    "it is well known that the keldysh approximation in the theory of multiphoton ionization is not gauge invariant . the detailed discussion of this issue can be found in ref .",
    "basing on physical grounds we use the dipole - length form ( [ vf ] ) for the interaction of the electron with the laser field .",
    "as thoroughly discussed earlier @xcite , this gauge stresses large separations of the active electron from the core where one - electron approximation is better justified and one can employ the asymptotic form for the initial - state wave function : @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath1 is the charge of the atomic residual core ( @xmath130 for a negative ion ) , @xmath131 is the active electron orbital momentum in the initial state and @xmath132 is the unit vector .",
    "the coefficients @xmath133 are tabulated for many negative ions @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath134 ( [ wf ] ) is singular at @xmath135 with the asymptotic behavior for @xmath136 defined by the long - range asymptote ( [ wf ] ) in the coordinate space @xmath137 with @xmath138 corresponding to @xmath136 .    at the present stage of our development",
    "the interpretation of ( [ mpref ] ) outlined above should be considered only as qualitative , since the two time integrations in eq.([mpref ] ) are not completely separated due to the factor @xmath139 .",
    "the complete factorization is possible under additional approximation which actually is not restrictive possessing a broad applicability range .",
    "we start with reiterating the basics of the adiabatic approximation in multiphoton detachment theory @xcite that allows one to carry out analytically integration in expression ( [ akeld ] ) or ( [ af ] ) for the amplitude .",
    "it is presumed that the laser frequency @xmath39 is small , i.e. that the number of absorbed photons @xmath78 is large ( the practical applicability of this approach proves to be very broad , since it gives reasonable results even for @xmath140 , see , for instance , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "then the integrand in ( [ akeld ] ) or ( [ af ] ) contains large phase factor @xmath141 $ ] and the integral may be evaluated using the saddle point method @xcite .",
    "the positions of the saddle points in the complex @xmath62 plane is defined by equation @xmath142 or , more explicitly , @xmath143 eqs.([seqa ] ) or ( [ seqb ] ) are to be considered together with the energy conservation constraint eq.([ec ] ) .",
    "note that according to formula ( [ wfmo ] ) the position of the saddle point coincides with the singularity of the bound - state wave function in the momentum space thus stressing the importance to describe correctly the long - range behavior of coordinate - space wave function .",
    "the latter could be ensured much more easily than the proper description of the wave function inside the core region .",
    "therefore the use of the adiabatic approximation and characterization of the bound wave function solely by its asymptotic behavior ( [ wf ] ) constitutes a self - consistent approach .",
    "the result of calculations of the amplitude ( [ akeld ] ) in the stationary phase approximation could be written as a modification of formula ( 25 ) in ref.@xcite : @xmath144 } { \\sqrt{2 \\pi \\left[- i s^{\\prime \\prime}(t_{m \\mu})^{\\nu+1 } \\right ] } } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the plane of the complex - valued time the saddle points @xmath145 lie symmetrically with respect to the real axis",

    "the integration contour in the plane of complex time is shifted upwards .",
    "therefore only two saddle points with @xmath147 are operative being included into the summation in ( [ a ] ) ( @xmath148 ) ; @xmath149 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath150 .",
    "although in the harmonic generation matrix element ( [ mpref ] ) the time integration variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 are not fully separated , as indicated above , the large phase factor @xmath151 $ ] in @xmath63 integration is the same as in the multiphoton detachment case ( [ akeld ] ) .",
    "therefore we can apply the saddle point approximation to carry out integration over @xmath63 .",
    "the integration contour is again shifted upwards in the complex @xmath63 plane ; this is the contour @xmath102 in the formulae ( [ facrr ] ) and ( [ mpref ] ) .",

    "this looks natural since there is no reason to prefer one of these directions .",
    "the right hand side of formula ( [ mfsp ] ) contains also summation over the saddle points @xmath166 ( for the monochromatic laser field two such points are operative being labeled by the index @xmath148 ) .",
    "however , as argued by kuchiev @xcite , actually only one saddle point ( i.e. one value of the label @xmath167 ) contributes for each choice of @xmath98 , i.e. for @xmath99 parallel to @xmath30 and for @xmath99 antiparallel to @xmath30 ( as discussed below , this has a simple and clear physical interpretation ) .",
    "consequently the double summation over @xmath168 and @xmath167 is effectively replaced by a single summation . moreover , in the latter sum both terms are equal . to see this one should remember that the preexponential factor @xmath139 changes sign depending on the value of @xmath98 .",
    "hence the remaining single summation is equivalently replaced by the factor of 2 .",
    "this allows us to finally rewrite ( [ mfin ] ) using ( [ mfsp ] ) as @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 are given respectively by ( [ amu ] ) and ( [ bs ] ) for negative ion ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "expression ( [ dfin ] ) is to be calculated for the subscript @xmath167 corresponding to one of the saddle points @xmath172 , for instance , that with the smaller value of @xmath173 ( and @xmath174 ) .",
    "in formula ( [ dfin ] ) the factor @xmath171 describes jointly the 3d - wave expansion and lar .",
    "these two effects could be further factorized using the approximation @xmath175 @xcite : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the laser - modified expansion factor in its simplest form and @xmath178 ( [ cf ] ) is lar amplitude .",
    "the adiabatic approximation could be further applied to carry out integration over @xmath62 in @xmath179 ( [ bs ] ) or in @xmath178 ( [ cf ] ) by the saddle point method .",
    "however below we do not pursue this objective and evaluate these integrals numerically .",
    "eq.([dfin ] ) and its simplified version ( [ ma ] ) present the main result of this paper .",
    "these formulae implement the very simple picture of the hg process as consisting of three successive steps .",
    "first , the electron absorbs @xmath78 laser photons .",
    "the amplitude of this event is @xmath180 . in order to contribute to hg",
    "the photoelectron has to return to the parent atomic core where lar is solely possible .",
    "the amplitude of return is described by the expansion factor @xmath27 .",
    "it appears explicitly in ( [ ma ] ) , while in ( [ dfin ] ) it is incorporated in the definition of the amplitude @xmath171 .",
    "the propagation of the electron describes the second phase of the event . at the third step the electron collides with the core absorbing @xmath181 photons from the laser field and emitting the single high - frequency quantum @xmath61 as it recombines to the bound state .",
    "this lar process has the amplitude @xmath182 ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "the summation over @xmath78 in the total amplitude @xmath42 ( [ dfin ] ) takes into account interference of the transitions via different intermediate ati channels .",
    "this appealing physical picture is supplemented by the very simple way to evaluate numerically all the quantities in ( [ dfin ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of photoionization @xmath183 is calculated via plain analytical formulae with the validity well testified before .",
    "the lar process did not attract much attention in the literature and certainly deserves more study that we hope to present elsewhere . here",
    "we emphasize only that since @xmath184 as well as closely related amplitude @xmath171 are very similar in structure to the amplitude @xmath183 , one can hope that similar methods of evaluation also produce reliable results .",
    "the nontrivial point in the presented picture is the probability for the ati electron to return to the core .",
    "intuitively , one could anticipate that such a process is suppressed , because the most _ natural _ behavior for the electron would be simply to leave the atom .",
    "the proper description of the suppression plays substantial role in the theory . according to the physical image of the ati process worked out in the adiabatic approach @xcite , after tunneling through the time - dependent barrier the ati electron emerges from under the barrier at some point which is well separated from the core .",
    "as a result this point becomes the source of an expanding spherical wave .",
    "this occurs twice per each cycle of the laser field , at the two moments of time @xmath185 when the source - points lie up and down the field @xmath30 from the core .",
    "the interference of the two spherical waves originating from the two different source - points results in non - trivial patterns in the angular ati photoelectron distributions obtained from ( [ a])-([amu ] ) @xcite@xcite in agreement with the available theoretical and experimental data .",
    "the probability for the ati electron to return to the core from the source - point is governed by the expansion factor @xmath27 and by the direction of propagation . at each of the moments @xmath185 only _ one _ of the two possible directions of @xmath99 , labeled in ( [ mpref ] ) by @xmath98",
    ", results in the electron eventually approaching the core . for",
    "the opposite direction of @xmath99 the electron recedes from the core and does not come back to recombine .",
    "in other words , for each direction of @xmath99 only one of the two saddle points @xmath185 contributes to hg .",
    "since both values of @xmath168 give identical contributions , summation over @xmath168 simply gives an extra factor of 2 in ( [ dfin ] ) .",
    "calculation of @xmath42 according to the formulae ( [ dtdef ] ) , ( [ dn ] ) , with exact wave function @xmath186 might be equivalently carried out in various forms which correspond to different choice of gauge .",
    "as soon as the approximations are employed , the theory looses gauge invariance .",
    "although the length gauge is known to be superior for the description of ati within the adiabatic approximation @xcite , the situation is not that straightforward for the high - energy photon . in the derivation above we employed the dipole - length form for the operator @xmath187 ( [ dtdef ] ) . in the velocity - length form",
    "this operator is to be substituted according to the rule ( @xmath188 is the electron momentum ) @xmath189 when calculation of @xmath42 is concerned ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "within framework of the present theory we calculate the rates of generating the @xmath28-th harmonic radiation ( @xmath193 is the velocity of light ) @xmath194 introduced by becker _",
    "et al _ @xcite ( and denoted by these authors as @xmath195 ) who in particular carried out calculations for the hg by h@xmath0 ion in the @xmath196 laser field .",
    "[ fig1 ] provides a complete comparison of these results with the results of our calculations .",
    "we employ the binding energy of h@xmath0 ( @xmath197 ) , but replace the true value @xmath198 @xcite by @xmath199 since this corresponds to the zero - range potential model used by becker _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "our rates were multiplied by the extra factor @xmath200 , where @xmath201 accounts for the presence of two active electrons in h@xmath0 . for the real h@xmath0 ion",
    "the results shown in fig.[fig1 ] are to be scaled by a factor @xmath202 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows harmonic spectra for the laser field intensities @xmath203 w/@xmath204 that correspond respectively to the keldysh adiabatic parameter values @xmath205 .",
    "thus the most interesting region of transition from the multiphoton regime ( @xmath206 ) to the tunneling mechanism ( @xmath207 ) is covered .",
    "our major results are shown by open circles in fig .",
    "they are obtained using the expression ( [ dfin ] ) for @xmath42 with the time - integration in @xmath171 ( [ bs ] ) carried out numerically .",
    "based on physical arguments , we extend the summation in ( [ dfin ] ) only over open ati channels with the real values of @xmath110 .",
    "generally the hg spectrum is known to consist of the initial rapid decrease , the plateau domain and the rapid fall - off region .",
    "the present theory is designed to describe the high hg but not the initial decrease , which in the case considered is noticeable only for one or two lowest harmonics . in the fall - of region , i.e. on the large-@xmath28 side ,",
    "our rates perfectly coincide with those obtained by becker _",
    "et al _ @xcite ( closed circles in fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the slight difference that could be hardly distinguished in the plot scale lies within uncertainty in retrieving data from the small - size plot published in ref . @xcite .",
    "of course , our comparison is carried out in absolute scale without any fitting or normalization .",
    "the deviations increase as @xmath28 decreases , but within entire plateau region the agreement of rates averaged over structures remains good .",
    "remarkably , the positions of numerous dips and peaks that exist in the plateau region are well reproduced by our calculations , although there exist some , generally not strong , discrepancies in their magnitudes .",
    "the structures has not yet received a universally accepted physical interpretation in the current literature with two tentative explanations being available .",
    "et al _ @xcite relate these structures to ati channel closing whereas lewenstein _",
    "et al _ @xcite suggest that it stems from quantum interferences between the contribution of different electron trajectories . within the present framework",
    "we can say that the origin of these structures lies in the interplay of interfering contributions of various ati paths , but their precise description would require an additional detailed analysis .",
    "approximation ( [ ma ] ) with numerical calculation of the integral in @xmath178 ( [ cf ] ) ( open squares in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) somewhat overestimates hg rate , but still retains the structure , though smoothed .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize two circumstances .",
    "first , to the best of our knowledge , we present here almost unique quantitative comparison of hg rates calculated within different theoretical methods , namely , by the present approach and by that developed by becker _",
    "et al_. we are aware of only two cases when the quantitative comparison was carried out previously , one refers to some parameters of hg by elliptically polarized light in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also discussion in the introduction ) , the other is comparison between the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and results of direct numerical integration of the three - dimensional time - dependent schrdinger approximation @xcite .",
    "second , the comparison is presented in the log - scale , as are the results reported by becker _",
    "et al _ , because it is appropriate both for the physics of the problem and for the current state of experiment .",
    "in the summation ( [ dfin ] ) over ati channels ( i.e. over @xmath78 ) the coherence is very important , since large number of terms is comparable in modulus , but have rapidly varying phases .",
    "many ati channels contribute to hg for each @xmath28 .",
    "this is in variance with the tentative conclusion by eberly _",
    "et al _ @xcite ) .",
    "the low ati channels give appreciable contribution even for quite high harmonics . only for the highest harmonics",
    "considered the contribution of low ati channels becomes negligible .",
    "although the length gauge is known to be superior for the description of ati within the adiabatic approximation @xcite , the situation is not that straightforward for the high - energy photon .",
    "therefore our calculations for the rates were carried out using both the length and velocity gauges . for large @xmath28",
    "the results obtained are very close , see fig .",
    "[ figratio ] ; the dipole - velocity gauge producing the rates about 10% larger . for smaller @xmath28",
    "the difference increases and manifests rather irregular @xmath28-dependence .",
    "however , even in the most unfavorable situation the ratio of the length - form to velocity - form results deviates from 1 not more than by 50% , which is rather reasonable , bearing in mind the multiphoton nature of the process .",
    "an evolution of the parameters of the individual @xmath28-th harmonic radiation with variation of the laser field intensity @xmath208 is presented in fig . [ figphase ] for some particular values of @xmath28 .",
    "we show both @xmath209 ( that is proportional to hg rate ) and the phase @xmath210 . the intensity dependence of the phase @xmath211 is known @xcite to play an important role in description of the harmonic field propagation in the experimental conditions when the spectral and spatial coherence properties are substantial .",
    "our calculations demonstrate rapid variation of the phase @xmath211 with the intensity @xmath208 : as @xmath208 increases by an order of magnitude the phase changes by about @xmath212 ( for @xmath213 ) or @xmath214 ( for @xmath215 ) .",
    "the dependence of phase on @xmath208 looks most simple in the fall - off domain where it is essentially linear , fig .",
    "[ figphase]d . as it is well known @xcite ,",
    "the hg rate manifests spikes ( see fig .",
    "[ figphase]a , where the spikes are slightly smoothed due to finite step over @xmath208 used in plotting ) at the intensities @xmath216 that correspond to the threshold of @xmath78-th ati channels , that is closed for @xmath217 due to ponderomotive potential @xmath218 ) .    as discussed in sec.[sec2 ] , in the fourier component @xmath42 ( [ dnmn ] ) the contribution of @xmath219 is anticipated to be negligible as compared with that of @xmath59 .",
    "the reader have to recall that the physical reason for this is that @xmath59 describes the _ natural _ sequence of events , when electron at first absorbs energy from the laser field and subsequently emits the high harmonic photon , whereas for @xmath220 the sequence is inverted . in order to illustrate",
    "how strong the preference is we show in fig .",
    "[ figminus ] the ratio @xmath221 .",
    "the ratio rapidly decreases with @xmath28 being very small in all cases where the present theory applies .",
    "it becomes noticeable only for small @xmath28 in case of intense laser field .",
    "the major result of this paper is a quantum mechanical description of the high - harmonic generation problem as a three - step process . in the first step the atomic electron absorbs several laser quanta and populates some ati channel .",
    "secondly , the electron propagates in the laser field back to the atomic core .",
    "the third step is the laser - induced recombination when the high harmonic photon is emitted .",
    "this mechanism is nothing more but interpretation of our principal formulae ( [ dfin ] ) , ( [ ma ] ) derived quantum mechanically with minimal approximations and without resort to any classical or intuitive arguments .",
    "the distinctive feature of our formulae ( [ dfin ] ) , ( [ ma ] ) is that they include only genuine amplitudes of the three constituent processes , i.e. each amplitude describes true physical fully accomplished process , as hg , ati or lar .",
    "here lies a crucial difference between our results and those of previous authors @xcite ( see also introduction ) who discussed mathematical structure of the matrix elements or integrals considered in their approach in terms of three - step mechanism but failed to present hg amplitude via amplitudes of physically observable accomplished ati and lar processes . even in a more broad context",
    "this is a rare and remarkable situation when a complicated process is reduced essentially exactly to the sum over all possible paths with every path described as a sequence of real , fully accomplished physical processes .",
    "this conceptual simplicity arises due to multiphoton , adiabatic nature of hg process .    with all three constituent amplitudes available from analytical formulae or simple numerical calculations our theory promises to be an efficient practical tool .",
    "this hope is supported by good agreement of our quantitative results for hg by h@xmath0 ion with the previous calculations by becker _",
    "et al _ @xcite in a wide range of laser intensities and frequencies of the emitted quantum .",
    "as the simplest example of possible future extensions we note only that our approach can be straightforwardly applied to negative ions with the outer electron having non - zero orbital momentum , such as halogen ions .",
    "these species could be easier accessible for the experimental studies .",
    "the structure of the formulae ( [ dfin ] ) , ( [ ma ] ) is so simple that it is tempting to suggest that they will work well if one substitutes in them ati or lar amplitudes obtained in some approximations other than those used in the derivation above .",
    "for instance , if ati amplitude more accurate than that given by the keldysh approximation is available from some theory , one can employ it for hg calculations via ( [ dfin ] ) , ( [ ma ] ) .",
    "this gives a hope to relatively simply improve account for the electron rescattering effects in the hg theory .",
    "the distinctive feature of the present theory of hg is the use of the representation based on the discrete set of ati channels . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this simple and apparently straightforward idea has not been exploited before .",
    "it would be underestimate to consider it merely as a detail of theoretical technique .",
    "indeed , if one pursues the objective of the most direct and far - reaching quantum implementation of the three - step mechanism of hg , then the use of ati channel representation becomes an unavoidable and crucial point .",
    "otherwise , if the amplitudes of ati do not appear in the theoretical scheme , hg can not be properly described as a three - step process .    in this paper",
    "we do not discuss qualitative features of hg spectra , such as extension of plateau domain etc .",
    "detailed discussion of these issues could be found in other publications @xcite , in particular in the paper by becker _",
    "et al _ @xcite whose results for hg by h@xmath0 ion we reproduce closely within our theory .",
    "this implies that the analysis of the _ numerical results _ carried out by becker _",
    "et al _ @xcite is fully applicable in our case . concerning the _ mechanisms and physical interpretation _ of hg spectra , the present theory , hopefully , can add more to our understanding .",
    "however , the related analysis requires further theoretical developments which would overburden the present , already quite a long paper .",
    "we hope to present these subsequent developments elsewhere . in a broader perspective",
    ", one can expect that modifications of our approach could be applied to a variety of processes such as population of high ati channels and multiple ionization of atoms .    as a summary , the three - step mechanism of the harmonic generation",
    "is ultimately justified .",
