    "in an earlier article @xcite , we have `` derived '' space , as a part of the random dynamics project @xcite .",
    "since we want to have locality , we also need to derive reparametrization symmetry , or more generally , diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite , essentially ensuring that the choice of coordinates plays no role in the formulation of the physical laws .",
    "we propose that diffeomorphism symmetry comes about as a result of a selection principle , in reality a selection principle for how nature `` chooses '' its symmetry groups , a scheme that has been developed by holger bech nielsen and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "the initial idea was that the small representations of the standard model gauge group @xmath0 is a signature of such a selection principle , singling out groups that have the `` smallest '' representations .    in the present article we use similar arguments , but instead of taking the standard model group @xmath1 as the selected group , we consider the combined diffemorphism - and - gauge group @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the group of all gauge transformations that map the four - dimensional spacetime manifold @xmath4 on the 12-dimensional manifold of @xmath5 : the lie group is a manifold , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the group of diffeomorphisms , a diffeomorphism @xmath8 given by a bijective differentiable map @xmath9      a major part of the success of the gut @xmath10 model is that the representations of the @xmath10 gauge group automatically represent the @xmath10 subgroup @xmath11 with the standard model lie algebra .",
    "the gut @xmath10 group thus presents the needed restrictions on the allowed represenstations of the standard model algebra .",
    "any successful gut group , like for example @xmath12 , reproduces the same restrictions as @xmath10 on the representations of the standard model lie algebra , restrictions corresponding to @xmath11 .    any viable alternative to the gut scheme",
    "must thus supply a prediction not only of the standard model lie algebra , but also of the group structure .",
    "there are however many possible scenarios , so unless one has some guiding principle for selection the unificaton group , there is nt much predictive power .",
    "one way to get the standard model without a gut scheme , is by using some selection principle for how nature selects the standard model group .",
    "the underlying philosophy is that of random dynamics , namely that the fundamental physics is random , and that the observed symmetries are emergent . if only some symmetries emerge , supposedly by accident , but maybe even by some more precise mechanism , then the initially random action could be considered as taking random values for some small region of the value space of the representation of the group , with the transformation properties of the fields or degrees of freedom under the group .",
    "the elements of a representation of the group in question then move quite slowly as the group elements themselves vary .",
    "( one can vary the group elements much before one varies the fields or matrices of the representation ) .",
    "the slower the representation moves as a function of the variation of the group elements the more likely it is that a symmetry emerges , since displacements inside the group itself corresponding to a small region ( over which we assume essentially constancy of the action ) become bigger with a slower representation motion rate .",
    "a symmetry of the random action is thus more likely to occur when the symmetry is represented by `` slowly moving '' representation elements ( e.g. matrices ) .    by means of some `` goal quantities ''",
    "we single out the groups that have the largest chance to emerge from a random action model , favouring the experimental gauge group and dimension of spacetime .      in yang mills theories , only the lie algebra is important , since two groups @xmath13 and @xmath14 that have the same lie algebra also have the same yang mills system .",
    "there are however many lie groups with the same algebra .",
    "these groups are locally similar , but globally they can be very different , with different representations .",
    "for example , @xmath15 , as for @xmath16 we have @xmath17 , while for @xmath18 @xmath19 , and it is only by studying the representations of nature like @xmath20 , @xmath21 , the higgs and so on , that we can establish which groups are at stake . to",
    "a group corresponds    * the lie algebra and thus the structure constants @xmath22 and the yang - mills lagrangian @xmath23 . *",
    "the system of allowed representations , a given set of representations only being allowed by some lie groups .",
    "the covering group ( for a given lie algebra ) can manage all the representations , so the goal is to find the most choosy group , i.e. the one that allows the fewest representations - which also corresponds to experimental data .",
    "our point of deparure is the standard model lie algebra @xmath24 and since we do nt find all its possible representations in naure , we will concentrate on the lie group rather than on the lie algebra .",
    "it is so to speak stronger to `` predict '' the group @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 a group which admits all phenomenological representations , which all obey the rule @xmath27",
    "small representations as one possible selection principle , but another way of singling out nature s chosen group , is by studying group _ skewness _ @xcite , defined as a lack of symmetry .",
    "nature seems to select the lorentz group with the smallest representations ; perhaps space moreover prefers those dimensions that give the skewest lorentz group .",
    "the standard model group @xmath5 = @xmath25 is very skew , and most probably very `` complicated '' .",
    "there is always the worry that the choice of `` goal property '' is such that it gets dramatically bigger or smaller with the dimension or some other size parameter of the group . in the case of choosing a skewness measure ,",
    "this can be dealt with by defining it as @xmath28      the degree of skewness is thus a function of the number of outer automorphisms of the group @xmath3 .",
    "an automorphism is an isomorphism of the group onto itself , @xmath29 i.e. a correspondance @xmath30 of @xmath31 with itself respecting the group multiplication , and such that @xmath30 is bijective and @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the map @xmath34 is an inner automorphism if there is an element @xmath35 , such that for all @xmath36 , @xmath37 the group of outer automorphisms @xmath38 is then defined modulo the inner automorphisms in the sense that in the group of all automorphisms @xmath39 , we discern the subgroup of inner automorphisms , @xmath40 and then define the group of outer automorphisms as @xmath41    for the standard model group , we have that    * the automorphisms of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 the @xmath44 factor ) are scalings with a factor @xmath45 . * the @xmath16 factor has complex conjugation ( in the defining representation ) as an automorphism , it is however an inner automorphism .",
    "* for the @xmath46 , as for all @xmath47 algebras with @xmath48 , complex conjugation is an outer automorphism .",
    "all outer automorphisms of the standard model algebra are combinations of these , since an automorphism maps the three invariant subalgebras into three isomorphic invariant subalgebras .",
    "there are infinitely many such automorphisms , but the standard model algebra together with the set of standard model properties ( the rule system ) is invariant under only one outer automorphism , namely complex conjugation of the @xmath46 combined with the @xmath44 scaling factor @xmath49 .",
    "among all algebras of dimensionality up to 12 dimensions , taking quantization rule systems into account , there are four combinations of algebras and rule systems that have no generalized outer automorphisms , namely those with semisimple algebras @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the other suggested selection principle , namely the size of a representation , was inspired by the fact that after the trivial representation , the lowest - dimensional non - abelian representations in the standard model are the remarkably small representations of @xmath16 and @xmath46 .",
    "a probablility argument for the presence of a selection principle can be formulated as follows : look at @xmath25 and count the lie groups of similarly low rank @xcite .",
    "it turns out that there are about @xmath52 = 256 groups with low dimension ( up to 12 , i.e. the dimension of the @xmath5 ) . among these about 256 groups , @xmath25",
    "is singled out - most probably by means of some selection principle like the size of the representations .    in order to obtain a more precise formulation of the selection principle , we need to establish what we mean by the `` size '' of a representation . for this purpose",
    "we define a measure for this size in terms of the quadratic casimir operators , which tag the representations in the sense that they are not defined for the algebra itself , but only for the representations .",
    "a general casimir invariant is a function @xmath53 of the lie group generators @xmath54 which is invariant under the group and commutes with all the generators , @xmath55=0.\\ ] ] the generators @xmath54 of the group constitute a basis for the corresponding lie algebra and satisfy the commutation relation @xmath56 = f^j_{ik}f_j,\\hspace{3 mm } i , k , j = 1,2,\\ldots.,d_g$ ] , where @xmath57 is the dimension of the group and @xmath58 are the structure constants by means of which we can construct a killing metric tensor @xmath59 .",
    "the quadratic casimir operator @xmath60 is used for measuring the `` size '' of a representation @xmath61 .",
    "this is done by normalizing the quadratic casimir of the representation by dividing it with the quadratic casimir for the adjoint representation , which consists of @xmath62 matrices @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 .",
    "the metric can thus be written @xmath65 , and in the first approximation , the `` size '' of the representation @xmath61 is taken to be @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the casimirs for the representation @xmath61 and the adjoint representation , respectively .    in the search for the groups with the smallest representations , we thus examine the quadratic casimir operators , bearing in mind that the quadratic casimir is well defined only for irreducible representations .",
    "our goal is to show that the combined group @xmath69 has a measure which is smaller than the standard model group measure , @xmath70 since this is a way of necessitating the existence of the group of diffeomorphisms .",
    "when we talk about @xmath5 , it should be noted that we actually have a @xmath5 in each point of spacetime , corresponding to a product of @xmath5 s : @xmath71 , this product however has the same size measure as @xmath5 itself , i.e. @xmath72 = @xmath73 .    according to schur s lemma @xcite ,",
    "in an irreducible representation , any operator that commutes with all the generators of the lie algebra must be a multiple of the identity operator .",
    "therefore @xmath74,where @xmath75 is the @xmath76 identity matrix , and @xmath77 is a coefficient which only depends on the representation @xmath61 , so we have @xmath78 the point is to minimize the relation @xmath79 , with some normalization of @xmath80 ( the normalization in reality being arbitrary ) .",
    "we are interested in the su(n ) group , which has the defining representation @xmath81 and the group elements are @xmath82 = nxn complex unitary matrices with determinant 1 .",
    "the matrices @xmath82 are @xmath83 , and can be written as @xmath84 , with infinitesimal generators @xmath85 .",
    "these @xmath86 constitute a real vector space with the dimension @xmath87 , i.e. the dimension of su(n ) , and we can choose a basis in the @xmath85-space , @xmath88 , which can be normalized .",
    "in an irreducible representation @xmath89 @xmath90 the quadratic casimir @xmath91 is only an eigenvalue , but it represents how intensively @xmath92 varies , in the sense that a small @xmath93 corresponds to a `` lazy '' @xmath94 .",
    "the casimirs thus function as a crude measure for how much the representation matrix varies as a function of the group element it represents . in a lattice context",
    "we take the contribution from one plaquette to be the trace of some representation of the group , the most general action @xmath95 is then a linear expansion on traces of all the possible representations of the gauge group , and the traces of the smallest representations supposedly dominate .",
    "this domination corresponds to the variation of the action as a function of how the combination of the link variables varies over the gauge group , and if the action varies relatively slowly over the group , it s taken as an indication that it also varies relatively slowly when we vary the gauge group .",
    "so with an action which is dominated by the contributions from small representations , the variation along the gauge variation is presumeably quite small , a situation corresponding to small quadratic casimir values .",
    "this increases the chance that an action which was not perceived as invariant under a gauge transformation , would nevertheless appear as gauge invariant .    to get an intuition of this `` smallness '' of a representation , consider su(2 ) with its quadratic casimir @xmath96 . on an irreducible representation ,",
    "@xmath96 effectively only takes one value , i.e. it has the same eigenvalue on the whole representation . with @xmath97",
    "we have a notion of distance , and we can visualise @xmath96 as performing a rotation , @xmath98 where the `` smallness '' of the representation means that @xmath99 is just slightly rotated ,        by means of the casimir measure we can thus define a size measure , making it meaningful to say that the representations of the non - abelian parts of the standard model are `` small '' . in the abelian case , it is however problematic to establish what we mean by the `` size '' of a representation . we can not apply a similar reasoning for the u(1 ) groups as for non - abelian groups , because in the abelian case we can not use the dimension of the representation as a measure , since abelian groups always have 1-dimensional representations , so dimension does nt tell anything .",
    "there simply is no casimir element defined , since for an abelian lie algebra the killing form is zero .",
    "what we can do is to consider the ratio of the charges of the representation and refer to a `` quantum of charge '' , for example the millikan unit quantum .",
    "the unique abelian invariant subgroup in the standard model gauge group corresponds to the weak hypercharge .",
    "that can however not be used as the quantum , since the quantum for @xmath100 is 1/6 , while right - handed charged leptons have @xmath101 , which is 6 times larger than 1/6 , and 6 is obviously not the smallest integer after zero .",
    "so instead we consider non - invariant abelian subgroups , and define an abelian representation as small if it has relatively many charges ( generators of the lie algebra ) with only the values 0 , 1 or -1 measured in the quantum .",
    "it turns out that the standard model has a relatively large set of such charges , so in this perspective , even from the abelian point of view the standard model is a model with `` small '' representations .      in order to normalize the measure by means of the casimir of the adjoint representation",
    ", we clearly need that there is a well - defined adjoint representation . in the case of a composed",
    ", non - simple group like @xmath102 , there is however no straightforward definition of the adjoint representation . for @xmath103 ,",
    "we therefore must find a way of varying the two adjoint normalizations relative to each other .    in order to achieve this",
    ", we seek to establish a ( faithful , 1 - 1 ) representation @xmath61 of @xmath103 on which we define a metric , whereby the image of @xmath103 becomes a manifold with a metric , allowing us to define a volume .",
    "one way to do this is to establish a ( faithful ) representation @xmath61 of @xmath103 on which we define a metric .",
    "thus the image of @xmath103 becomes a manifold with a metric , which makes it possible to define a volume .",
    "the measure @xmath104 is then given as the volume ratio of the two representations , taken to the power @xmath105 , @xmath106 in the representation picture @xmath107 , i.e. @xmath108 thus @xmath109 and in the case of @xmath110 where the @xmath111 are simple , the quantity @xmath112^{\\frac{1}{d_1+d_2+\\ldots+d_k}}\\ ] ] is a `` good quantity '' .",
    "for an irreducible representation @xmath61 , consisting of a set of @xmath113 matrices @xmath114 , the second - order index @xmath115 of the representation is defined by @xmath116 taking the trace of ( [ ett ] ) , we get for the quadratic casimir @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the dimension of the representation @xmath61 , and @xmath57 is the group dimension . for the defining , fundamental representation @xmath119 of @xmath47 ( i.e. , in reality the algebra @xmath120 ) the second - order index is @xmath121 , and for the adjoint representation @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which gives @xmath124 , thus for @xmath16 @xmath125 .    there are presumably other candidates , like @xmath126 , with the fundamental representation consisting of @xmath127 real matrices .",
    "one can define higher tensor representations from the defining vector representation @xmath119 , but there are also additional , double - valued spinor representations , similar to @xmath128 , generated by direct products of the fundamental spinor .    in the case of the @xmath47 group ,",
    "the faithful representation with the smallest quadratic casimir , is the fundamental representation @xmath119 , while for the @xmath126 group the picture is much more complicated , as the faithful representation @xmath85 with the smallest quadratic casimir might be either the vector representation , or the spinor representation , the spinor representation being the winner for @xmath129 .",
    "for the vector representation , the second - order index for the @xmath126 fundamental and adjoint representations are @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively , and the dimension of the adjoint representation @xmath132 , thus @xmath133 , and for the corresponding spinor representation we have @xmath134 .",
    "another competitor is @xmath135 , with @xmath136 , thus @xmath137 in the search for the groups chosen by nature , we examine the @xmath138 for the different groups , but we also worry about possible differences between 3 + 1 and 4 spacetime dimensions .",
    "for example , for dimension d = 3 + 1 , we have for the lorentz group @xmath139 , while for d = 4 , @xmath140 . for both d = 3 + 1 and d = 4 , the lorentz group however has the same small @xmath141 , @xmath142 while for d = 2 and d = 5 , the value is bigger .",
    "the lorentz group @xmath143 in reality comes from a symmetric metric @xmath144 . if @xmath145 instead had been antisymmetric , we would have symplectic groups , which are not so competitive , as they have bigger @xmath138 .",
    "we consider the lorentz group as a function of the dimension @xmath146 and of the `` geometry '' , in the sense of the dependence on whether @xmath147 is symmetric , antisymmetric or nonexistent .",
    "but an antisymmetric @xmath147 actually does very poorly , while for @xmath146 = 3,4 it looks good for symmetric @xmath147 ; and for the case without metric for @xmath146 = 2 @xcite .    among simple groups , su(2 )",
    "has the smallest @xmath138 , but in order to allow su(3 ) be let in , some cooperation with su(2 ) is necessary , since the spin(5 ) , which is the covering group of so(5 ) , in reality seems to outdo su(3 ) .",
    "su(3 ) however has a relatively big center @xmath148 , so if we divide by the group center su(3 ) is in good shape , since the so(5 ) covering group has a smaller center . for su(3 ) , the number of elements in the center is 3 , while the center of su(2 ) merely has 2 elements , and likewise for spin(5 ) .",
    "we thus redefine our measure of representations as @xmath149^{2/d}}\\ ] ] we in reality consider volumes : @xmath150 and with @xmath151 , @xmath152 the quadratic casimir being a sort of area in the group .",
    "we define our group @xmath103 as the combination of the gauge transformations of @xmath5 and the group of diffeomorphisms .    a diffeomorphism so to say moves a function , by the operation @xmath153 the displacement takes place in a given direction , and if we perceive the diffeomorphisms as vectors over a manifold , then for infinitesimal @xmath154 the set of displacements @xmath155 constitutes a tangent field .",
    "the group of diffeomorphisms does not have a ( usual ) lie algebra , but we take as the lie algebra a set of fields @xmath156 corresponding to the tangents @xmath157 which amounts to substituting a manifold with a space of functions on the manifold , @xmath158 = [ \\sum_{\\mu}\\epsilon^{\\mu } \\partial_{\\mu},\\sum_{\\nu}\\epsilon^{\\nu } \\partial_{\\nu}],\\ ] ] and then we could take @xmath159 as a kind of casimir . there are scarcely any outer automorphisms for the group of diffeomorphisms , and if all the automorphisms for the group of diffeomorphisms are inner , the group of diffeomorphisms is maximally skew .",
    "it should however be noted that the group of diffeomorphisms depends on the topology of the space on which it is operating , for example for @xmath160 , the diffeomorphism group has a trivial center .    even though the lie algebra for the group of diffeomorphisms is not a usual lie algebra ,",
    "the group is still a lie group .",
    "consider the mappings of a manifold onto itself , @xmath4 , @xmath161 , i.e. @xmath162    * bijective , * sufficiently many times continuously differentiable , * a group under the group of diffeomorphisms ,    then @xmath163 is really a `` lie group '' , which is clear by considering @xmath164 and take the commutators @xmath165 = [ 1+\\delta\\varphi_1,1+\\delta\\varphi_2 ] \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "one difficulty we meet with respect to the combined group @xmath103 is that the group @xmath7 of diffeomorphisms is probably simple , while the group @xmath3 of gauge transformations is not , @xmath166 meaning @xmath167 and @xmath168 and for a non - simple group we can not define a straightforward measure like @xmath169 for the size of representation .",
    "there is however one possibility to define a quadratic casimir replacement , viz .",
    "@xmath170 where @xmath171 .",
    "the problem is that we can not really have a metric , since a metric would not be diffeomorphism - symmetric . on the other hand ,",

    "represent @xmath7 by the lorentz group , taken as @xmath229 or @xmath230 , supposing we are in 3 + 1 or 4 dimensions , and use @xmath231 ( with the corresponding group dimension 6 ) . in accordance with ( [ comp1 ] ) we then define a tentative measure for the composite group @xmath232 , as @xmath233^{\\frac{1}{\\sum d_i}}=\\\\ & = \\left[\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^3\\cdot\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^8\\cdot\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^6 \\right]^{\\frac{1}{17}}= 0.406213 ... \\end{array}\\ ] ] where we for @xmath234 have used @xmath235 , keeping in mind that the quadratic casimir for @xmath227 is the same as for @xmath5 itself , and ignored @xmath44 .    for @xmath5 alone , we get @xmath236^{\\frac{1}{\\sum d_i}}=\\\\ & = \\left[\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^3\\cdot\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^8\\right]^{\\frac{1}{11}}= 0.424320 ... , \\end{array}\\ ] ] so in this crude approach , @xmath237 .",

    "let us make no assumption about the dimension @xmath119 in @xmath126 , and simply plot the expression ( [ casim ] ) for @xmath238 as a function of @xmath119 for @xmath239 , @xmath240^{\\frac{1}{\\sum d_i}}=\\\\ & = \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{3}{8}\\right)^3\\cdot\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^8\\cdot \\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{16(n-2 ) } \\right)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{11+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}},\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]        corresponding to a minimal value for the size @xmath238 at @xmath241 .",
    "these encouraging results , both for the relative smallness of @xmath238 compared to @xmath242 , and well as the singling out of @xmath241 , are of course based on a coarse evaluation , which is to be refined with a more precise formulation of the quadratic casimir for the group @xmath243 , in order to accomplish a fair comparison between the sizes of the two groups .",

    "we have discussed different `` goal quantities '' , especially the size of a representation of a group , identified as the size of the quadratic casimir , which is connected with natural metric on the space of unitary matrices in the representations .    with this `` goal quantity '' in mind , we argue that diffeomorphism symmetry necessarily comes about , because the size of the bigger group , which is the semidirect product of the standard model group and the group of diffeomorphisms , is smaller than the size of th standard model group .",
