    "geophysics and astrophysics give rise to problems involving waves in axisymmetric rotating fluid bodies .",
    "the fluid outer core of the earth supports inertial waves , for which the coriolis effect provides the restoring force .",
    "such waves have been tentatively identified in gravimetric data and related to theoretical work as well as laboratory experiments ( e.g. aldridge & lumb 1987 ) .",
    "helioseismology uses the observed frequencies of solar oscillations to deduce the internal structure and rotation of the sun , while asteroseismology applies related techniques to distant stars ( e.g. christensen - dalsgaard 2002 ) .",
    "waves in astrophysical accretion discs have been studied because of their important role in the interaction of a planet or other satellite with the disc in which it forms ( e.g. goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) , and also in an attempt to explain observed quasi - periodic oscillations from accreting white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes ( e.g. kato 2001 ) .",
    "some of these problems involve free modes of oscillation that may grow through mechanisms of overstability or may be excited by turbulent noise . tidal interactions between orbiting and spinning bodies , however , involve an almost strictly periodic forcing of waves .",
    "after the linearized wave equations governing the dynamics of the fluid are reduced by fourier analysis in time and azimuth , there results a two - dimensional problem for the spatial structure of the wave in the meridional plane ( see appendix  [ a : character ] ) . in the absence of dissipative effects such as viscosity",
    ", this problem may have either elliptic or hyperbolic character depending on the frequency of the wave .",
    "a mixed - type problem may also occur if the character of the equations changes from one part of the body to another .",
    "typically , hyperbolic character occurs when the wave frequency ( doppler - shifted , in the case of a non - axisymmetric wave , into the frame rotating with the local fluid ) is small , in the range of inertial and gravity waves rather than acoustic waves .",
    "when a hyperbolic system of equations is posed in a finite region with physical boundary conditions on a closed surface , rather than the mathematically canonical cauchy boundary conditions on an open surface , the problem can be regarded as ill - posed and generally does not possess a regular solution .",
    "this property presents a serious difficulty when one seeks the response of a body to low - frequency tidal forcing .",
    "it is possible to sidestep this issue in certain problems of special symmetry where a separation of variables can be applied .",
    "for example , in a spherically symmetric non - rotating star the linearized equations can be projected on to spherical harmonics and the problem reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations in the radial direction .",
    "most treatments of tides in stars and giant planets have used this approach ( e.g. zahn 1970 ) , or have included the coriolis force within the so - called ` traditional approximation ' ( in which only the radial component of the angular velocity is considered ) , which also permits a separation of variables ( e.g. ioannou & lindzen 1993 ; savonije & witte 2002 ) .",
    "the simplest problems involving inertial waves , featuring an incompressible fluid in a full spherical , spheroidal or cylindrical container , can also be solved by separation of variables and appear to possess complete sets of normal modes with regular eigenfunctions , even in the absence of viscosity ( e.g. greenspan 1968 ; zhang , liao & earnshaw 2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately the approximation of a non - rotating star is rarely valid in problems of tidal forcing .",
    "the tidal frequencies are linear combinations of the orbital and spin frequencies with small integer coefficients , apart from small corrections due to any precessional effects . in most problems of interest ,",
    "the frequencies of the most important tidal components are smaller in magnitude than twice the spin frequency of the body , and the coriolis force can not be neglected ( ogilvie & lin 2004 ) .",
    "the traditional approximation is valid only in stably stratified regions where the tidal frequency is much less than the buoyancy frequency , and does not apply in convective regions of stars or giant planets where the buoyancy frequency is essentially zero . in such regions the wave equations are hyperbolic in character , describing pure inertial waves , and can not be solved by separation of variables .",
    "numerical solutions of the two - dimensional problem were obtained by savonije , papaloizou & alberts ( 1995 ) and savonije & papaloizou ( 1997 ) in the case of an early - type star with a small convective core and , more recently , by ogilvie & lin ( 2004 ) in the case of a giant planet with an extended convective region .",
    "numerical studies have revealed the intricate structure of inertial waves in an incompressible rotating fluid contained in a spherical annulus ( hollerbach & kerswell 1995 ; rieutord & valdettaro 1997 ) . in order to find normal modes",
    "it is necessary to include a viscosity so that the problem becomes of elliptic character and is mathematically regularized . as the viscosity tends to zero the eigenfunctions become increasing localized in the neighbourhood of singular linear structures known as wave attractors , as described in greater detail by rieutord , georgeot & valdettaro ( 2001 ) and rieutord , valdettaro & georgeot ( 2002 ) .",
    "a wave attractor can be understood as a limit cycle towards which the characteristic rays of the inviscid wave equation are focused as they reflect repeatedly from the boundaries of the container .",
    "unlike the case of a full sphere , it appears that inertial waves in a spherical annulus do not possess regular eigenfunctions in the absence of viscosity , apart from the exceptional ` r modes ' or ` toroidal modes ' which involve no radial motion .",
    "the presence of an inner core introduces a complexity into the reflection patterns of the characteristic rays and causes them to be focused on to wave attractors . the existence and importance of these closed ray circuits in spherical shells",
    "have been known for some time ( stern 1963 ; bretherton 1964 ) and many features of this problem were understood before the advent of high - resolution numerical calculations ( stewartson & rickard 1969 ; stewartson 1972 ) .",
    "wave attractors have also been studied for internal gravity waves . in a notable experiment , maas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) applied a periodic forcing to a narrow tank containing a stratified salt solution . for wave frequencies smaller in magnitude than the uniform buoyancy frequency of the fluid ,",
    "the characteristic rays of the inviscid wave equation are straight lines with a definite angle of inclination depending on the frequency . in an upright rectangular tank",
    "the rays would propagate around the container ergodically or , for special frequencies related to the rational numbers , would close after a finite number of reflections . by making one of the side - walls sloping , maas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) introduced a wave attractor , in this case an inclined rectangle , into the problem ( maas & lam 1995 ) .",
    "their experiment indicates that the forced response is localized in the neighbourhood of the attractor , and this concentration ultimately leads to secondary effects such as mixing .",
    "inertial waves in a rotating tank of similar shape have also been studied by maas ( 2001 ) and manders & maas ( 2003 ) .",
    "there is a close analogy between these problems .",
    "the relation between the tank with the sloping side - wall and the upright rectangular tank is similar to the relation between the spherical annulus and the full sphere . in each case",
    "rays in the geometrically simpler container ( rectangular tank or full sphere ) propagate ergodically or , for special frequencies , form periodic orbits .",
    "the inviscid wave equation admits regular eigenfunctions for a countable set of frequencies , which may or may not be those for which the rays form periodic orbits . in the geometrically more complicated , but more generic , containers the rays are focused on to one or more wave attractor for almost all wave frequencies , and the inviscid wave equation does not admit regular eigenfunctions .    in problems of tidal forcing it",
    "is of great interest to know how the total dissipation rate varies with the forcing frequency , as this determines the rate of secular evolution of tidally interacting systems .",
    "when the viscosity is small , systems that possess regular inviscid normal modes can be expected to exhibit a strong resonant amplification of the dissipation rate in the vicinity of the eigenfrequencies , but very small dissipation elsewhere .",
    "although the eigenfrequencies may be everywhere dense in some interval , the smooth forcing will have a significant overlap only with a few of the lowest - order modes .",
    "in contrast , wave attractors have a structural stability and exist in intervals of frequency that depend on the geometry rather than the viscosity .",
    "systems possessing wave attractors can be expected to exhibit a richer response with significant dissipation occurring over extended ranges of frequency .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse the linear response of such systems to periodic forcing in the low - viscosity limit relevant to the geophysical and astrophysical applications .",
    "i work with simplified model problems but also explain how they are related to the original systems .",
    "the main result is a validation of the conjecture of ogilvie & lin ( 2004 ) that , in problems where a wave attractor occurs , the total dissipation rate tends to a non - zero value that is independent of both the magnitude and the form of the small - scale damping process of the waves .",
    "this outcome differs significantly from problems that possess regular inviscid normal modes and is of primary importance for tidally interacting systems .",
    "the analysis presented here provides a method of calculating the asymptotic dissipation rate and also describes the spatial form of the forced disturbance .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s : maas ] i briefly describe the problem of forced internal gravity waves as a definite example of the system under consideration .",
    "i define a prototypical problem in ",
    "[ s : prototypical ] and construct the asymptotic solution in the limit of small viscosity . in ",
    "[ s : non - viscous ] i adapt the analysis to a related problem in which the damping mechanism is not of a viscous nature .",
    "i present the results of direct numerical calculations in  [ s : numerical ] and compare these with the asymptotic theory .",
    "a concluding discussion is found in  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "in this section i outline the preliminary analysis for forced internal gravity waves in a narrow tank .",
    "this is essentially identical to the problem studied by maas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) except that a vortical body force is assumed rather than a parametric forcing .    consider a fluid initially at rest in a gravitational field @xmath0 and with a uniform temperature gradient @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are cartesian coordinates . in the boussinesq approximation the linearized equations for the velocity @xmath3 and the temperature perturbation @xmath4 are ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the pressure perturbation divided by the reference density , @xmath9 is the coefficient of expansion , @xmath10 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath11 is the thermal diffusivity .",

    "@xmath26 .    with rigid walls the boundary conditions are @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the outward normal vector on the boundary .",

    "the occurrence of wave attractors in containers of various shapes has been illustrated by maas et al .",
    "in this section i slightly abstract the above problem and define a prototypical model problem that is very closely related but marginally simpler to solve .",

    "[ s : maas ] , one can think of @xmath15 as the streamfunction of a two - dimensional flow of an incompressible fluid subject to no - slip boundary conditions .",
    "the viscosity of the fluid is proportional to @xmath43 and the curl of the body force is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "the limit @xmath40 corresponds to the reynolds number being large .",
    "the problem is linearized and a harmonic time - dependence of all quantities has been assumed .",
    "the fluid has a restoring force such as buoyancy or the coriolis force .",
    "in fact the inviscid part of the problem of forced internal gravity waves considered above can be rendered exactly in this form by a linear transformation of the coordinates , depending on the wave frequency , that maps the sloping characteristics on to horizontal and vertical lines . in the process",
    "the viscous @xmath45 operator is slightly modified , although this has essentially no practical consequences .",
    "consider the inviscid version of equation ( [ eq_del4 ] ) , obtained by setting @xmath46 and abandoning the no - slip boundary condition @xmath47 .",
    "the inviscid equation is hyperbolic and its characteristics are horizontal and vertical lines . in general , the inviscid problem is mathematically ill - posed and does not possess a regular solution .",
    "instead , one must consider the limit @xmath48 of the viscous problem .",
    "the time - averaged energy dissipation rate may be defined as @xmath49 using equation ( [ eq_del4 ] ) and the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) one can relate the dissipation to an overlap integral between the vorticity forcing and the streamfunction in the form @xmath50 the problem at hand is to determine how @xmath51 depends on @xmath52 in the limit @xmath48 ( and also on @xmath44 and @xmath53 if these are varied ) .      a _ ray segment _ consists of a horizontal or vertical line segment connecting two points of @xmath42 ( _ vertices _ ) and lying wholly in @xmath53 .",
    "a _ ray circuit _ consists of a connected set of consecutive ray segments and represents the propagation of a wave characteristic around the container .",
    "typically a ray circuit will be of infinite length .",
    "exceptionally , a circuit that closes on itself after a finite number of reflections is a _",
    "periodic orbit_.    in principle , the domain @xmath53 may contain any number of periodic orbits .",
    "i consider the case in which @xmath53 contains exactly one periodic orbit and the orbit is simple ( i.e. a rectangle ) . without loss of generality",
    "one may place the origin of coordinates at the bottom left - hand corner of the rectangle so that the corners @xmath54 are at @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "i label the segments 1 , 2 , 3 ,  4 in the order @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "let the slopes of the boundary at the four corners be @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then @xmath68 is the tangent of the angle between the ` incident ' ray ( in the positive sense @xmath54 ) and the boundary at the end of segment  @xmath69 .    for rays close to the periodic orbit",
    ", the boundary may be represented locally by linear approximations @xmath70 the local approximate mapping of vertices defined by the ray propagation ( in the positive sense @xmath54 ) is then @xmath71 on each loop , therefore , @xmath72 it may be expected that @xmath73 in a typical asymmetric container .",
    "the periodic orbit is then attracting , and focuses rays propagating either in a positive sense ( if @xmath74 ) or in a negative sense ( if @xmath75 ) .",
    "i assume without loss of generality that @xmath74 ( the case @xmath75 can be obtained by a reflection of the problem ) .",
    "the focusing direction is then @xmath54 and @xmath9 is the focusing power of the attractor .",
    "a particularly useful illustrative example is provided by a quadrilateral container ( figure  [ f : quadrilateral ] ) .",
    "the quadrilateral is defined uniquely by specifying the rectangle @xmath54 and the four tangents @xmath76 .",
    "it can be shown that the wave attractor is unique .",
    "all ray circuits other than the attractor itself converge towards the attractor at either end .",
    "i assume that this property holds in the domain @xmath53 .",
    "the attractor divides the boundary into two zones , one consisting of @xmath77 together with @xmath78 and the other consisting of @xmath79 together with @xmath80 .",
    "ray circuits other than the attractor itself have all their vertices in one zone or the other .",
    "therefore the attractor has two ` sides ' to it , and any ray circuit converges towards the attractor from the same side at either end .    for rays near the attractor one can measure the distance from the attractor using the @xmath14-coordinates of the appropriate vertices ( the ones near @xmath81 ) .",
    "the entire bundle of rays associated with one side of the attractor ( e.g. the ` positive ' side @xmath82 ) can be labelled using a variable @xmath83 defined as follows .",
    "one starts a ray at a vertex very close to @xmath81 and with @xmath14-coordinate @xmath84 for some arbitrarily large positive integer @xmath85 .",
    "the ray is followed in the negative sense as it spirals away from the attractor .",
    "eventually it turns around and converges towards the attractor again , having vertices very close to @xmath81 with @xmath14-coordinates @xmath86 , @xmath85 .",
    "this mapping between one end of a ray circuit and the other defines a function @xmath87 , with @xmath88 .",
    "the variable @xmath89 is periodic in nature ( @xmath90 is identified with @xmath91 ) since the ray bundle wraps around itself .",
    "the function @xmath87 can be considered topologically as a map of the circle on to itself .",
    "owing to the reversibility of the ray circuit it has the self - inverting property @xmath92 , which will be used later .",
    "for the negative side @xmath93 of the attractor there is a similar variable @xmath94 and a mapping @xmath95 . in problems with multiple or non - simple attractors",
    "a more complicated mapping of ray bundles is likely to exist .      in the limit @xmath48 the solution divides into three regions : ( i ) an inner region localized near the wave attractor and consisting of a detached shear layer of width @xmath96 ; ( ii ) an outer region consisting of most of the rest of the container ; ( iii ) standard viscous boundary layers of width @xmath97 close to the walls .",
    "there are also boundary layers in the corner regions close to the vertices of the attractor .",
    "i first simplify the problem by assuming that a particular solution for the inviscid problem can be found , i.e. a function @xmath98 satisfying the equation @xmath99 without regard to boundary conditions .",
    "( this can be obtained by an indefinite integration of @xmath100 with respect to @xmath101 and @xmath14 . )",
    "the desired solution is then @xmath102 where @xmath103 satisfies the equation @xmath104 and the boundary conditions @xmath105 note that @xmath44 and @xmath106 are supposed to be smooth and do not have any fine structure associated with boundary layers or shear layers .",
    "therefore the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq_tilde ] ) is small everywhere and will be unimportant in constructing the leading - order asymptotic solution .",
    "the inhomogeneity has effectively been transferred from the differential equation to the boundary conditions .",
    "the asymptotic outer solution is simply of the form @xmath107 it satisfies the inviscid problem @xmath108 with the boundary condition @xmath109 the second boundary condition is taken care of by the intervention of a standard viscous boundary layer ( region ( iii ) mentioned above ) .",
    "the general solution of equation ( [ eq_outer ] ) is @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are functions to be determined .",
    "consider two consecutive vertices , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , say , of a ray circuit .",
    "if they are connected by a horizontal ray segment , they share the same value of @xmath14 and therefore of @xmath115 .",
    "it follows from equations ( [ bc_outer ] ) and ( [ sol_outer ] ) that @xmath116 .",
    "similarly , for vertices connected by a vertical ray segment , @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath106 is known , a knowledge of @xmath111 ( or @xmath112 ) at any vertex would be sufficient to propagate the solution along the ray circuit .",
    "however the given boundary conditions do not provide such information .",
    "consider the ray circuit as described in ",
    "[ s : circuits ] . at each end of the circuit",
    "the ray indefinitely repeats a loop around the attractor @xmath54 . around each loop",
    "the value of @xmath111 must change by an amount @xmath118 and the value of @xmath112 also changes by @xmath119 . since @xmath106 is smooth , one need not worry about the small variation of @xmath106 close to the vertices of the attractor .",
    "in fact @xmath120 where the integration is over the area enclosed by the attractor .",
    "therefore @xmath119 is independent of the choice of particular solution @xmath106 .",
    "it is also notable that if , as in  [ s : maas ] , @xmath44 is the perpendicular component of the curl of the external force per unit mass , then stokes s theorem provides a simple relation between @xmath119 and the line integral @xmath121 of the force around the attractor .",
    "it follows that @xmath115 exhibits an increasingly fine structure and , in general , a logarithmic divergence as @xmath122 .",
    "the same is true of @xmath123 near @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and of @xmath115 near @xmath126 .",
    "this singular behaviour of the outer solution is the reason that an inner region , in which viscosity regularizes the solution , is required . for small @xmath14 , one has @xmath127 consider the positive side @xmath82 first and define the variable @xmath128 , which increases by @xmath129 on each loop .",
    "then @xmath130 as @xmath131 , with @xmath132 the general solution of this functional equation is @xmath133 i.e. @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the ray - labelling variable introduced previously and @xmath136 is an arbitrary function with period @xmath129 .",
    "it may be expanded in a fourier series @xmath137 for the negative side of the attractor , a similar result holds , with @xmath138 and @xmath139    now consider the total change in @xmath115 around the ray circuit , from a vertex with @xmath140 , @xmath141 , to a vertex with @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "this change can be computed numerically by summing the values of @xmath106 , with appropriate signs , at the vertices visited by the ray circuit .",
    "the total change can be written as @xmath144\\delta+\\delta^+(\\theta^+),\\ ] ] where @xmath145 does not depend on @xmath146 or @xmath147 because to increment either by @xmath129 adds a loop around the attractor at one end and changes @xmath115 by @xmath148 at that end .",
    "owing to the reversibility of the ray circuit , @xmath149 .    connecting the asymptotic forms , equation ( [ hplus_limit ] ) , of the solution at the two ends of the circuit , one finds @xmath150 the general solution of this functional equation is @xmath151 where @xmath152 is an arbitrary function satisfying the symmetry condition @xmath153 .",
    "an analogous equation holds for the negative side of the attractor .",
    "there is insufficient information to determine the solution uniquely until the equations for @xmath136 and @xmath154 can be linked through the dynamics in the inner region .",
    "the inner solution is localized near the attractor and consists of four segments .",
    "i begin by defining coordinates parallel ( @xmath155 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath156 ) to the ray in each segment : @xmath157 in segment  @xmath69 the parallel coordinate @xmath158 runs from @xmath159 to @xmath160 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",

    "@xmath69 the asymptotic inner solution is of the form @xmath164 and satisfies the equation @xmath165 which follows from equation ( [ eq_tilde ] ) under the assumed scalings .",
    "part of the difficulty in solving equation ( [ eq_inner ] ) consists of connecting the four segments .",
    "boundary conditions apply in the corner regions where the segments meet and the wave is reflected . where segment  @xmath69 overlaps with segment @xmath166 , the asymptotic solution consists simply of the linear superposition of @xmath167 and @xmath168 , because equation ( [ eq_inner ] ) is linear and homogeneous . in the corner region , @xmath158 and @xmath169 are essentially constant while @xmath163 and @xmath170 vary by @xmath171 .",
    "therefore the corner solution is of the form @xmath172 the location of the boundary is given by @xmath173 from the boundary condition @xmath174 one obtains the relation @xmath175 which connects the solutions in consecutive segments .",

    "the boundary condition ( [ bc_inner ] ) then translates simply into the condition that @xmath190 be continuous at each vertex .",
    "meanwhile the equation ( [ eq_inner ] ) becomes simply @xmath191 this concatenation procedure effectively ` irons out ' the corners in the attractor , allowing the solution to proceed continuously .",
    "it is important to note that the coordinates @xmath192 cover the corner regions twice .",
    "as noted above , in the corner regions the asymptotic solution is the sum of the solutions in the segments that meet there .",
    "in fact the boundary condition at vertex @xmath81 is different because the perpendicular coordinate @xmath156 undergoes a net focusing by a factor of @xmath9 after one loop around the attractor .",
    "the boundary condition there is @xmath193 to satisfy this condition requires a kind of self - similar viscous spreading of the shear layer to compensate for the geometrical focusing .",

    "one reason for investigating this robustness is that the true mechanism by which tidal disturbances in astrophysical bodies , such as inertial waves in the convective regions of giant planets , are damped is uncertain .",
    "the true viscosity is exceedingly small , and the waves may decay more readily by other means .",
    "their interaction with convective motions might be modelled in terms of an eddy viscosity , but the validity of such an approach is unclear and estimates of the relevant effective viscosity vary widely . alternatively",
    ", inertial waves may undergo ohmic damping in the presence of a magnetic field since they couple to alfvn waves on small scales .",
    "they may also experience nonlinear parametric decay into waves of shorter wavelength .",
    "the last two mechanisms are probably modelled more accurately , although still only crudely , by using a ` frictional ' damping force proportional to the velocity , rather than a viscous force .    another way to view the following analysis is that it results from the landau prescription in which the frequency of the forced wave is given a small positive imaginary part , thereby rendering the inviscid problem soluble , and a limit is taken in which the imaginary part of the frequency tends to zero .",

    "one simplification is that no viscous boundary layers occur , although in fact it was not necessary to consider the boundary layers of the previous problem in any detail .",

    "no attempt is made to patch with the outer solution , which is much smaller and more difficult to determine properly .",
    "even with this restriction the agreement is very good at @xmath288 .",
    "in this paper i have considered a prototypical forced linear wave equation featuring a wave attractor and weak viscous damping .",
    "this mathematical problem describes the long - term linear response of a typical bounded fluid to a periodic body force with a frequency within the range of inertial and gravity waves . through asymptotic analysis confirmed by direct numerical calculations in an illustrative quadrilateral domain ,",
    "i have shown that the forced disturbance is localized in the neighbourhood of the attractor and that the total dissipation rate is asymptotically independent of the viscosity . by considering a related equation with a non - viscous damping force ,",
    "i have argued further that the asymptotic dissipation rate is independent of the nature , as well as the magnitude , of the weak damping mechanism .",
    "these findings have important consequences for physical problems such as that considered in  [ s : maas ] and motivated by the experiments of maas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , in which a periodic body force excites internal gravity waves in a narrow tank of non - rectangular cross - section . in that problem",
    "the wave attractors exist in certain intervals of frequency that depend only on the geometry of the container .",
    "the long - term linear response of the fluid should give rise to a dissipation rate that is asymptotically independent of the viscosity and is a smoothly varying function of the forcing frequency within the interval associated with a given attractor .",
    "this differs markedly from the case of an upright rectangular tank , in which the response of the fluid is governed by resonances with the regular inviscid normal modes that can exist in that container , and the dissipation rate will be very small except where it is strongly amplified in the vicinity of the resonant frequencies of the lowest - order modes . as noted by maas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , wave attractors have a ` finite bandwidth ' while the width of a normal - mode resonance is limited by viscosity .",
    "ogilvie & lin ( 2004 ) recently studied the linear response of a giant planet with an extended convective region to periodic tidal forcing .",
    "inertial waves propagating in the annular convective region do not form regular eigenfunctions in the absence of viscosity .",
    "numerical solutions indicated that , when the ekman number is small , the disturbance tends to be localized on a web of rays . for intervals of frequency",
    "in which simple wave attractors exist , it was possible to identify their appearance in the solutions .",
    "in figure  10 of ogilvie & lin ( 2004 ) it can be seen that the dissipation rate appears to have converged to a value independent of the viscosity in the intervals where the dissipation rate is largest .",
    "it can be confirmed by tracing rays in the annulus that these intervals are those associated with the simplest and most powerfully focusing wave attractors . although more complicated attractors exist outside these intervals , their focusing power is evidently not great enough to have led to a convergence of the dissipation rate at an ekman number of @xmath315 .",
    "these numerical results are qualitatively consistent with the conclusions of the present paper , and in future work we will attempt to evaluate the asymptotic dissipation rate for tidal forcing in a spherical annulus directly using the methods described here",
    ".    forced inertial waves in a rotating incompressible fluid contained in a spherical annulus were computed previously by tilgner ( 1999 ) , who noted that wave attractors can be detected in the solutions at small ekman numbers but that other complicating features are also present . in his problem , which derives from earlier experimental studies , the forcing results from a sinusoidal modulation of the rotation rate of the boundaries , which is communicated to the fluid through viscous boundary layers .",
    "as the viscosity is reduced , the energy of the forced disturbance is also diminished .",
    "this behaviour is different from that found in the present paper with a distributed body force that is independent of viscosity , such as that resulting from tidal forcing .",
    "the apparent robustness of the dissipation rate is reassuring when it is considered that the true mechanism by which the inertial waves are damped is uncertain and difficult to model accurately .",
    "it is likely that the result is reasonably robust in other ways as well .",
    "for example , small corrugations of the boundary may not be so important for inertial waves as for acoustic waves , which undergo specular reflection .",
    "inertial waves of a given frequency can propagate only in four different directions , and the angle of reflection will not be changed by a small corrugation .",
    "the wave attractors depend more on the gross shape of the container than on the precise contours of the boundary .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the ` inner ' equations ( [ eq_inner ] ) and ( [ eq_inner_del2 ] ) studied in this paper are generic in the following sense .",
    "provided that the inviscid wave equation is a hyperbolic second - order linear partial differential equation , its characteristics can be determined and any wave attractors identified .",
    "curvilinear coordinates can then be introduced parallel and perpendicular to each segment of the attractor .",
    "if the equation contains a weak damping term resulting from a positive operator of either fourth or second order , then the coordinates can always be rescaled to obtain equation ( [ eq_inner ] ) or equation ( [ eq_inner_del2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "this is true even if the inviscid equation has non - constant coefficients and the damping operator is anisotropic and depends on position , provided that there are no singularities such as corotation resonances or critical latitudes .",
    "further work is required to understand the transition from normal modes to wave attractors as the geometry of the container is varied .",
    "ogilvie & lin ( 2004 ) found that some ` memory ' of the normal modes of inertial waves in a full sphere was retained when a small solid core was introduced .",
    "even though no inviscid normal modes are believed to exist in a spherical annulus , the dissipation rate is still enhanced in the vicinity of the eigenfrequencies of the lowest - order modes of the full sphere .",
    "an imperfect resonance is possible with such modes , which have a length - scale larger than the radius of the core and are not greatly affected by it . at the same time , introduction of the solid core",
    "allows a much richer response at other frequencies , associated with wave attractors .",
    "it is possible that in such problems the attractors achieve complete dominance only at ekman numbers yet smaller than those achieved in recent numerical studies .",
    "a remarkable theory of axisymmetric inertial waves in an incompressible rotating fluid contained in a spherical annulus was developed by rieutord et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who considered normal modes that are regularized and damped by viscosity .",
    "their problem is similar to that considered in the present paper , but there are also important differences .",
    "neglecting some of the effects of curvature so as to make the equations somewhat simpler , they found asymptotic solutions for normal modes in the limit of small ekman number , in excellent agreement with their numerical calculations .",
    "the modes are localized near a wave attractor and satisfy an eigenvalue problem analogous to that for the wavefunction of a quantum - mechanical harmonic oscillator .",
    "the width of the shear layers in these modes scales with @xmath316 , although the authors noted that @xmath317 layers also play a role when the problem is studied in full spherical geometry . in contrast , the solutions described in ",
    "[ s : prototypical ] have only a @xmath317 shear layer and satisfy a different inner equation that has no strictly localized solutions but is forced from the outside .",
    "the reason for the different scalings is that the normal modes considered by rieutord et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have frequencies that are asymptotically close to the edge of the band within which the attractor exists , so that the attractor is very weak and its focusing power @xmath9 is asymptotically close to  @xmath129 .",
    "in contrast , the forced solutions in the present paper are constructed for the more interesting frequencies that lie properly within the bandwidth of the attractor , so that @xmath9 is not very close to  @xmath129 .",
    "it is likely that a different asymptotic theory of forced oscillations could be constructed for values of @xmath9 very close to  @xmath129 , which would more closely resemble the analysis of rieutord et al .",
    "however , it still remains to be demonstrated in detail how the analysis in the present paper applies to forced oscillations in spherical geometry .",
