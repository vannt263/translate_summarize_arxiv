    "the sub - group of neutron - star transients spend most of their time in quiescence during which hardly any or no accretion occurs .",
    "however , these transients sporadically become very bright ( @xmath2@xmath3  erg s@xmath4 ) owing to a huge increase in the accretion rate onto their neutron stars . during those outbursts",
    ", these sources can be readily studied with the available x - ray instruments , but obtaining high quality quiescent data remains a challenge . in spite of this , several systems",
    "have now been studied in detail : they typically exhibit 0.510 kev luminosities of @xmath5  erg s@xmath4  and their spectra are usually dominated by a soft component which can be described by a thermal model .",
    "this emission is thought to be due to the cooling of the neutron star which has been heated during the outbursts ( brown , bildsten , & rutledge 1998 ; campana et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "most neutron - star transients are active for only weeks to months , but several systems have remained active for years and even decades ( the quasi - persistent neutron - star transients ; wijnands et al .",
    ". wijnands et al .",
    "( 2001 ) realized that those systems are excellent targets to study the effects of accretion on the behavior of neutron stars by observing them in quiescence .",
    "the accreting material is expected to have a larger effect on the neutron stars in such systems than on the neutron stars in short - duration transients ( wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ; rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the latter systems ,",
    "the crust is only marginally heated during the outbursts and will quickly return to thermal equilibrium with the core after the end of the outbursts . in the quasi - persistent transients , however ,",
    "the crust is heated to high temperatures and becomes significantly out of thermal equilibrium with the core ( rutledge et al .",
    "after the end of the prolonged outbursts , it will cool until it returns to equilibrium with the core .",
    "the exact cooling time depends on the thermal conductivity of the crust , the core cooling processes , and the accretion history of the source .",
    "ks 1731260 was the first quasi - persistent transient to be studied in detail in quiescence .",
    "it was observed using _",
    "chandra _ shortly after the end of its @xmath012.5 year outburst ( wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ) and it was found to have a luminosity of @xmath6  erg s@xmath4  ( for a distance @xmath7 kpc ; 0.510 kev ) .",
    "half a year later it was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and it was found that its luminosity had decreased by a factor of 23 ( wijnands et al .",
    "2002b ) . using the cooling curves calculated by rutledge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , this drop in brightness can be explained if the neutron star has a large crustal conductivity and enhanced core cooling processes . in september 2001 ,",
    "a second quasi - persistent neutron - star transient ( mxb 165929 ) turned off after having accreted for @xmath02.5 years .",

    "( 2003 ) obtained a _",

    "( 2003 ) observed an eclipse and dipping behavior during the 2001 observation ( similar to the outburst behavior of the source ; lewin 1979 ; cominsky et al .",
    "1983 ; cominsky & wood 1984 , 1989 ) .",
    "to search for eclipsing behavior during the 2002 and 2003 observations , we determined the orbital phase range covered by those observations using the time of the eclipse in the 2001 observation as the reference time .",
    "given the orbital phase range traced during each observation , we expect to see a single eclipse per observation and , as anticipated , we did not detect any photons during the expected eclipse intervals .",
    "however , we also found that no photons were detected during several time intervals ( of equal duration as the lengths of the eclipses ) at different phases of the orbital period .",
    "therefore , without prior knowledge of the eclipsing nature of mxb 165929 , we could not have concluded that we saw eclipses during the 2002 and 2003 observations .",
    "owing to the limited statistics of the 2002 and 2003 observations , no conclusions can be drawn about possible dipping behavior during these observations .",
    "when extracting the spectra , we used all data , including those taken during the intervals of eclipses and possible dipping behavior .",
    "the eclipses could not be removed from the data before extracting the spectra because the uncertainties in the ephemeris presented by oosterbroek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are sufficiently large so that the exact start and end times of the expected eclipses could not be determined .",
    "instead we decreased the exposure time in the resulting spectral files by 900 s since the eclipse duration during outburst was found to be @xmath0900 s ( wachter et al . 2000 ) and wijnands et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported an eclipse duration of 842@xmath1290 seconds for the 2001 observation .",
    "small differences in the eclipse duration might be present between the observations but the expected effects on the resulting fluxes will be marginal .",
    "we also did not remove the data obtained during the dipping interval observed in the 2001 observation .",
    "such dipping intervals are likely present during the other two observations but they can not be identified in the light curves due to limited statistics .",
    "for those two observations all data had to be used and to obtain a homogeneous data selection across observations , we included the dipping interval observed during the 2001 observation .",
    "wijnands et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found evidence that this dipping behavior is likely due to a change in internal absorption in the system and not due to actual changes in the neutron - star properties .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the ( possible ) dipping intervals will likely result in a somewhat higher column density ( @xmath13 ) in the spectral fits than the true interstellar @xmath14 toward the source , but should not significantly impact other source properties .",
    "we grouped the spectra in bins of 15 counts to validate the use of the @xmath15 fitting method and simultaneously fitted the three spectra using xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "a variety of one - component models20%25% , @xmath1635%45% , and @xmath1650%100% , for the 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 observation , respectively .",
    "the range of upper limits is due to the range assumed in photon indices ( between 1 and 2 ) . ]",
    "could fit the individual spectra satisfactorily , but since we expect that the x - rays from mxb 165929 are due to the cooling of the neutron - star surface , for this paper we only fit the data using a neutron - star hydrogen atmosphere model ( nsa ; for weakly magnetized neutron stars ; zavlin et al .",
    "in such models the normalization is given by @xmath17 , with @xmath18 in pc .",
    "the distance should be constant between observations and therefore we left the normalization tied among the different spectra ( when leaving the normalizations free between observations , we find that they are consistent with each other ) .",
    "we expect the @xmath13 toward the source to be very similar between observations ( only minor variations are expected due to variable internal absorption ) and this parameter was also tied . we assume a canonical neutron star with a radius of 10 km and a mass of 1.4 m@xmath19 .    from the fits , we found that the normalization was @xmath20 which yields a source distance of 513 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the distance range given in the literature ( 1013 kpc ; oosterbroek et al .",
    "2001 ; muno et al .",
    "however , we found that the errors on the fit parameters were dominated by the large uncertainties in the normalization and did not allow us to realize the full potential of the data .",
    "if the source distance were established through an independent method , we could fix the normalization in the nsa models , resulting in considerably smaller errors on the remaining fit parameters .",
    "therefore , instead of leaving the normalization as a free parameter , we fixed it so that it corresponded to a distance of 5 , 10 , and 13 kpc , covering the full range of allowed distances obtained when the normalization was a free parameter . to estimate the bolometric fluxes ( @xmath21 ) we extrapolated the model to the energy range 0.01100 kev which gives approximate bolometric fluxes by calculating the bolometric luminosity @xmath22 , with @xmath23 stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath24 the effective temperature ( at infinity ) , and",
    "@xmath25 the neutron - star radius ( at infinity ) .",
    "the 0.01100 kev fluxes were indeed consistent with the calculated @xmath21 .",
    "we use the measured fluxes because their errors takes into account the uncertainties in @xmath13 and the @xmath24 obtained for all observations .",
    "the @xmath26 errors are only calculated using the @xmath24 errors during one specific observation . [ footnote ] ] . to calculate the flux errors , we fixed each free fit parameter ( only one at a time ) either to its minimum or maximum allowed value .",
    "after that we refitted the data and recalculated the fluxes .",
    "this process was repeated for each free parameter and the final flux range determined the flux errors .",
    "the fit parameters obtained are listed in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "this table shows that @xmath24 and @xmath21 decreased in time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ) .",
    "we fitted the @xmath24 and @xmath21 curves with an exponential decay function @xmath27 , with @xmath28 a normalization constant , @xmath29 the start time , and @xmath30 the @xmath1-folding time .",
    "we found that the other fit parameters were not very sensitive to the value of @xmath29 , but when @xmath29 was left free it had adverse effects on the errors on those parameters .",
    "therefore , we fixed @xmath29 to mjd 52159.5 which corresponds to midday september 7 , 2001 ( the last day mxb 165929 was found to be active ; wijnands et al .",
    "2002a ) and which can be regarded as an approximation of the time when @xmath24 and @xmath21 began to decrease .",
    "the assumed exponential functions could adequately describe the decrease in @xmath24 and @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ; alternative functions did not provide adequate fits ) .",
    "we found that @xmath30 and @xmath28 for the @xmath21 curve were 289@xmath1237 , 262@xmath1233 , and 254@xmath1229 days , and 70@xmath129 , 48@xmath126 , and 43@xmath126 @xmath31",
    "erg @xmath32 s@xmath4 , when assuming a distance of 5 , 10 , or 13 kpc , respectively , in the spectral fits .",
    "the corresponding @xmath30 and @xmath28 for the @xmath24 curve were 1153@xmath12160 , 1060@xmath12126 , and 1055@xmath12112 days , and 0.099@xmath120.004 , 0.126@xmath120.004 , and 0.139@xmath120.004 kev .",
    "we saw no evidence that the curves approached a rock - bottom value : we found an upper limit on such a value of 3.57.5 @xmath31 erg @xmath32 s@xmath4  for the @xmath21 curve ( resulting in bolometric luminosity limits of 2.27.0 @xmath33 erg s@xmath4 ) , and 0.060.07 kev for the @xmath34 curve .",
    "we have presented monitoring _ chandra _ observations of mxb 165929 in quiescence .",
    "the first observation was taken only a month after the end of its last outburst which lasted 2.5 years ; the second and third observations were taken @xmath01 and @xmath01.5 years after this initial one . because it is expected that the emission should be dominated by thermal emission from the hot neutron - star crust ( see wijnands et al .",
    "2003 ) , we fitted the data with a nsa model for weakly ( @xmath35 g ) magnetized neutron stars .",
    "we found that @xmath21 decreased by a factor of @xmath08 in @xmath01.5 years and the rate of decrease followed an exponential decay function .",
    "furthermore , @xmath36 also decreased and the rate of decrease again followed an exponential decay function .",
    "we found that the @xmath1-folding time of the @xmath37 curve was consistent with four times that of the @xmath21 curve , as expected if the emission is caused by a cooling black body for which the bolometric luminosity is given by @xmath38 ( see footnote  [ footnote ] ) : if @xmath24 decays exponentially , @xmath26 ( and thus @xmath21 ) will also decay exponentially but with an @xmath1-folding time four times smaller than that of @xmath24 , exactly what we observe .",
    "our results support the suggestion that the crust was heated to high temperatures during the prolonged accretion event , which ended a month before our first observation , and that it is now cooling until it reaches thermal equilibrium with the core .",
    "rutledge et al . ( 2002 ) calculated cooling curves for the neutron star in ks 1731260 , assuming different behaviors of the crustal micro - physics and the core cooling processes .",
    "those curves can be used as a starting point to investigate how our results of mxb 165929 could be explained . of those curves , only the one which assumes a large crustal conductivity and the presence of enhanced core cooling processes exhibits a large luminosity decrease in the first two years after the end of the last outburst , suggesting that the neutron star in mxb 165929 has similar properties .",
    "this conclusion was already tentatively reached by wijnands et al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on a comparison of the luminosity seen during the october 2001 _ chandra _ observation with the significantly lower luminosity upper - limit found with _",
    "rosat_. but detailed cooling curves for the neutron star in mxb 165929 need to be calculated to fully explore ( and exploit ) the impact of our observations on our understanding of the structure of neutron stars .",
    "the cooling curves calculated by rutledge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for ks 1731260 only give us a hint of the behavior of mxb 165929 because they depend on the long - term ( @xmath39 years ) accretion history of the source . for ks 1731260 ,",
    "this long - term accretion behavior was quite unconstrained due to large uncertainties in the averaged duration of the outbursts , the time - averaged accretion rate during the outbursts , and the time the source spent in quiescence .",
    "however , the accretion history of mxb 165929 over the last three decades is much better constrained ( wijnands et al .",
    "2003 ) , which will help to reduce the uncertainties in its long - term averaged accretion history allowing for more detailed cooling curves to be calculated for mxb 165929 .",
    "this might help to constrain the physics of the crust better for mxb 165929 than for ks 1731260 .",
    "the only significant uncertainty left is that of the source distance ; however , we found that this only affects the exact values of the bolometric fluxes and the effective temperatures , but not their rate of decay .",
    "our 0.510 kev flux during the may 2003 _ chandra _ observation is still higher than the upper limit found with _ rosat _ , suggesting that the crust will cool even further in quiescence and that we have not yet reached thermal equilibrium between the crust and core .",
    "further monitoring observations are needed to follow the cooling curve of the crust to determine the moment when the crust is thermally relaxed again .",
    "when this occurs , no significant further decrease of the quiescent luminosity is expected and from this bottom level the state of the core can be inferred . as of yet",
    ", we have found no evidence that the flux and temperature are reaching a leveling - off value , associated with the temperature of the core , although the limits we obtained are not very stringent .",
    "jonker , wijnands , & van der klis ( 2004 ) suggested that the difference in luminosity of mxb 165929 between the _ rosat _ non - detection and the 2001 _ chandra _ observation might be due to differences in residual accretion rate onto the surface .",
    "residual accretion could indeed produce soft spectra ( e.g. , zampieri et al .",
    "1995 ) , but to explain the exponential decay we observe for @xmath21 and @xmath36 , the residual accretion rate must also decrease exponentially with a timescale of a year .",
    "although this can not be completely ruled out , we believe this is unlikely since other neutron - star transients have been observed to reach their quiescent states on timescales of only tens to several tens of days at the end of their outbursts ( e.g. , campana et al . 1998b ; jonker et al .",
    "2003 ) and the variations in accretion rate tend to be more stochastic . moreover , if the neutron star has a significant magnetic field strength , this might inhibit material from reaching the surface when accreting at the inferred low rates .",
