    "absolute optical instrument ( ai ) is a device that provides a perfectly sharp image of all points in some spatial region  @xcite .",
    "the simplest ai is a plane mirror that gives a virtual image of a whole half - space .",
    "another , beautiful example of an ai is maxwell s fish eye , discovered by j.  c.  maxwell in 1854  @xcite , that images sharply the whole space , and all rays form circles . in recent years",
    "absolute instruments attracted an increased interest which has led to proposing new devices of various types , e.g. ais that perform imaging of the whole space , of optically homogeneous regions  @xcite , or provide magnified images  @xcite .",
    "a general method has been proposed in  @xcite for designing spherically symmetric ais .",
    "this research was based on geometrical optics .    recently ais attracted attention also from the point of view of wave optics .",
    "it was shown both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite that these devices can provide subwavelength resolution , although this claim has raised controversy @xcite and it is still not clear to what extent such a super - resolution can be used practically  @xcite .",
    "a different question was addressed in  @xcite , namely what are the general characteristics of the spectrum of eigenfrequencies of ais .",
    "it was shown that the spectrum consists of tight groups of levels with almost equidistant spacing between them .",
    "this finding was based on an analysis of a light pulse propagating in the ai and on the assumption that a short pulse emitted at some point can be absorbed at the image point during a short time as well .",
    "numerically calculated spectra of various ai confirmed this theoretical result very well .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the spectra of absolute instruments by a completely different method . employing the wkb approximation with the langer modification and using one of the general properties of ais",
    ", we confirm in a different way the previously known results about their spectrum  @xcite .",
    "our method has two advantages compared to the previous one : it enables to calculate not just the spacing of the level groups but also their offset , and it allows to treat the situations where a mirror is used in the device .",
    "we verify our results by comparing the calculated spectra with numerical values for several examples of ais .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ absolute ] we recall absolute instruments and discuss some of their properties . in sec .",
    "[ wkb ] we employ the wkb method for calculating the spectra of radially symmetric media and in sec .",
    "[ examples ] we illustrate the results on particular examples of ais . in sec .",
    "[ mirror ] we analyse the situation in ais that contain mirrors , and we conclude in sec .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we recall some properties of absolute instruments from the point of view of geometrical optics , which will be useful for the subsequent calculations .",
    "we will consider radially symmetric ais with the refractive index distribution @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we will focus on a specific class of absolute instruments , namely ais of the first type  @xcite .",
    "ai of the first type is a device with the property that every point a from its whole volume has a full image at some point b , which means that all rays emerging from a reach b. since the role of the points a and b can be interchanged , it is clear that any ray emerging from the point a returns back to this point again , so a is an image of itself . in some ais",
    ", it is the only image , in other ones there may be more images .    the ai can be either three- or two - dimensional . in the latter case",
    "we consider a 2d propagation of rays in a 2d refractive index profile . due to the radial symmetry of the device",
    ", the following quantity analogous to the mechanical angular momentum is conserved  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the angle between the tangent to the particle trajectory and the radius vector . in 3d",
    ", another consequence of the radial symmetry of the device is that each ray lies in a plane containing the centre of symmetry of the device o , so the ray trajectory can be described in polar coordinates @xmath3 both in the 2d and 3d cases . for nonzero @xmath4 , the polar angle @xmath5 increases ( or decreases ) monotonically while @xmath6 oscillates between the turning points @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "we will assume that for each possible value of @xmath10 , there are just two turning points that coalesce when @xmath10 reaches its largest possible value @xmath11 .    in order to ensure that any ray emerging from a point a eventually returns there , the change of the polar angle @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath6 changing from @xmath7 to @xmath8 must be a rational multiple of @xmath13 , so we can write @xmath14 , @xmath15 was used instead of @xmath16 . ] .",
    "we will assume in this paper that the value of @xmath16 is the same for all possible angular momenta @xmath10 , which is the most usual case .",
    "with respect to this assumption and since any point is an image of itself , the optical path @xmath17 from a back to a is equal for all rays  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the ray from a back to a consists of an integer number of segments on each of which @xmath6 changes from @xmath7 to @xmath8 or back .",
    "therefore also the optical path @xmath18 between two turning points has to be equal for all rays , i.e. , it is independent of the angular momentum @xmath10 .",
    "this optical path can in general be expresses as @xmath19 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) and written the dependence on @xmath10 explicitly .",
    "the fact that for absolute instruments @xmath18 is independent of @xmath10 is of a key importance for calculation of the spectra with the wkb method , as we will see in the following section .    as the last thing we will express the optical path between the turning points in a different way .",
    "when @xmath10 increases , the turning points @xmath20 approach each other and finally meet at the point @xmath21 , the radius of the circular ray , for the maximum possible value of angular momentum @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding optical path @xmath18 is then equal to the geometrical path @xmath23 multiplied by the refractive index @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25",
    "for simplicity we will consider a monochromatic scalar wave in the ai that can be described by the helmholtz equation @xmath26 if the speed of light is set to unity , @xmath27 is at the same time equal to the frequency @xmath28 of the wave .",
    "separating the radial and angular parts in terms of @xmath29 ( in 3d ) or @xmath30 ( in 2d ) and making the substitution @xmath31 ( in 3d ) or @xmath32 ( in 2d ) , we get the equation for @xmath33 in the form @xmath34w=0\\quad\\mbox{(3d)},\\qquad",
    "w''+\\left[-\\frac{m^2 - 1/4}{r^2}+k^2 n^2\\right]w=0\\quad\\mbox{(2d)}\\ , , \\label{for_w}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "the equations  ( [ for_w ] ) are analogous to the radial part of the schrdinger equation obtained when solving a quantum - mechanical motion in a central potential .",
    "as was shown by langer  @xcite , however , a direct application of the wkb method to that equation leads to problems due to the centrifugal potential and termination of the @xmath6-axis at @xmath35 , and yields wrong results for the energy spectrum of the system .",
    "a careful analysis shows that the problem can be eliminated by the substitution @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 in 2d )  the so - called langer modification , see  @xcite or   49 of  @xcite .",
    "then the wkb method can be applied to the resulting equation directly and gives correct results .",
    "exactly the same argument applies also in our case , which leads to the equations @xmath38w=0\\quad\\mbox{(3d)}\\ , , \\label{for_w2}\\ ] ] and @xmath39w=0\\quad\\mbox{(2d)}\\ , .",
    "\\label{for_w2 - 2d}\\ ] ] we can now apply the wkb approximation to these equations directly . in the following we will write the formulas just for the 3d case as the treatment of the 2d case is analogous and can be obtained from the 3d results by the substitution @xmath40 .",
    "we first substitute @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ for_w2 ] ) , which yields @xmath42\\rho=0 \\label{}\\ ] ] then we separate the real and imaginary parts and in the real part neglect the term @xmath43 with respect to @xmath44 ; this corresponds to the first order of wkb approximation .",
    "this way we get two equations @xmath45 where we have denoted @xmath46 the first equation in ( [ eq - wkb ] ) has the solution @xmath47 , the second one has the solution @xmath48 . combining these solutions ,",
    "we get @xmath49 the function @xmath33 has an oscillatory behaviour in the region where @xmath50 is real , i.e. , between the turning points @xmath20 at which @xmath50 turns to zero . for @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ", @xmath50 is imaginary and the function @xmath33 describes evanescent waves in these regions .",
    "we now need to match the oscillatory and evanescent solutions in the three regions , which will give the quantisation condition for @xmath27 .",
    "this matching , however , can not be done within the wkb method itself because the condition @xmath53 breaks up at the turning points .",
    "still there are several ways how to get around this problem  @xcite .",
    "one of them is to treat @xmath6 formally as a complex variable and circumvent the turning point in the complex @xmath6-plane .",
    "another standard method is to approximate the bracket in eq .",
    "( [ for_w2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath54 , by a linear function of @xmath6 in the vicinity of the turning point ( say @xmath8 ) .",
    "both of these methods give the same well - known result  @xcite : the wave decaying for @xmath52 matches the following wave in the oscillatory region : @xmath55 this will be discussed in detail for a more general case in sec .",
    "[ mirror ] .",
    "a similar consideration can be made for the other turning point @xmath7 . to satisfy both the phase conditions simultaneously , it must hold @xmath56 where we have defined @xmath57 eq .  ( [ cond ] ) is equivalent to the born - sommerfeld quantisation rule in quantum mechanics  @xcite and together with eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) it presents the main result of this section .    in some situations",
    "the condition imposed on the function @xmath33 may be different .",
    "in particular , if there is a mirror in the ai at some radius @xmath58 , then the wave must vanish there .",
    "this condition will then lead to a different phase shift in eq .",
    "( [ approxcos ] ) and hence to a shift in the eigenfrequencies , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ mirror ] .      to find the eigenfrequencies for which the condition  ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied",
    ", we need to evaluate the integral  ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "quite remarkably , @xmath59 is closely related to the optical path  @xmath18 in the @xmath3 plane between the turning points , defined by eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath60 as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ absolute ] , in ais @xmath61 is independent of @xmath10 , and therefore the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ der ] ) does not depend on @xmath27 for a fixed @xmath62 .",
    "this allows us to integrate eq .",
    "( [ der ] ) to get @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an integration constant with respect to @xmath27 . to find it , we consider the situation when the turning points @xmath20 ( given by the condition @xmath65 ) coincide . as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ absolute ] , this corresponds to the value @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) . comparing the square roots in eqs .",
    "( [ s ] ) and  ( [ p ] ) , we see that the corresponding value of @xmath27 is @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "moreover , in this situation @xmath68 because @xmath69 .",
    "( [ sol ] ) then yields the constant @xmath70 . substituting this to eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) , we get for @xmath27 @xmath71 \\label{kphi}\\ ] ] combining eqs .",
    "( [ kphi ] ) and  ( [ cond ] ) , we get finally the quantisation condition for the eigenfrequencies of a 3d absolute instrument @xmath72\\,\\quad    n=0,1,2,\\dots\\ , \\label{k3d}\\ ] ] the spectrum of a 2d ai is obtained by replacing @xmath73 by @xmath74 : @xmath75\\,\\quad    n=0,1,2,\\dots   \\label{k2d}\\ ] ] the formulas  ( [ k3d ] ) ,  ( [ k2d ] ) for the wkb - approximated spectrum of absolute instruments form the central result of this paper .",
    "they are based on the key relation  ( [ der ] ) and on the fact that in ais the optical path @xmath18 is independent of the angular momentum .",
    "inspection of the formulas  ( [ k3d ] ) ,  ( [ k2d ] ) shows two things .",
    "first , for absolute instruments the wkb spectrum is degenerate , and this degeneracy increases with the frequency .",
    "this is obvious from the fact that @xmath16 is a rational number for ais , and usually it is a ratio of small integers .",
    "then we can find a number of combinations @xmath76 yielding the same frequency @xmath27 , and this number increases with increasing @xmath62 and/or @xmath77 . since the formulas  ( [ k3d ] ) and  ( [ k2d ] ) give the wkb approximation to the spectrum , the exact spectrum exhibits this degeneracy only approximately and the eigenfrequencies form tight groups . the second property that follows from eqs .",
    "( [ k3d ] ) and  ( [ k2d ] ) is that the frequency groups are positioned equidistantly because @xmath16 is rational and @xmath78 and @xmath77 all change in integer steps .",
    "as was shown in  @xcite , both of these properties of the spectrum have key importance for the ability of ais to focus waves .",
    "( [ k3d ] ) and  ( [ k2d ] ) not only confirm the previous results , but in addition enable to calculate the absolute position of the spectral structure , which was not possible by the previous method .",
    "to see how well the wkb spectrum approximates the actual spectrum , let us now apply our results on several examples of ais .",
    "we will represent the spectra graphically by the function @xmath79 that has been introduced in  @xcite ( the notation @xmath80 was used instead ) .",
    "its value at integer @xmath81 is simply the @xmath82 eigenfrequency and for the non - integer @xmath81 , @xmath79 is given by linear interpolation  @xcite .",
    "degenerate levels are clearly exhibited in the graph of @xmath79 as intervals where the function is constant .",
    "* * maxwell s fish eye * , @xmath83 . in this case",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 , which yields the wkb spectrum in 2d @xmath86 the analytic form of the spectrum is @xmath87 with the exception of the lowest level , eq .",
    "( [ kmfe1 ] ) approximates the correct values  ( [ kmfe2 ] ) very well : for @xmath88 the relative error is only @xmath89 , for @xmath90 it is @xmath91 , and it further decreases with increasing @xmath92 .",
    "the two spectra are compared graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ]  ( a ) . for the 3d maxwell s fish eye profile ,",
    "the wkb and exact eigenfrequencies are given by the same equations  ( [ kmfe1 ] ) and  ( [ kmfe2 ] ) , respectively , with @xmath74 replaced by @xmath73 .",
    "again the agreement is very good . * * hooke index profile * with the refractive index @xmath93 .",
    "this formula for the index is used also for @xmath94 where @xmath95 becomes imaginary .",
    "this allows to calculate the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies analytically as well ; they are given by the laguerre - gaussian functions similarly as stationary states of an isotropic 2d harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics . in this case",
    "@xmath96 , @xmath85 , which yields the 2d wkb spectrum @xmath97 this is at the same time also the analytical form of the spectrum , so the wkb approximation yields the exact values for the eigenfrequencies in this case .",
    "this is in a complete analogy with the situation in quantum mechanics where the wkb approximation also yields the exact values for the energy eigenvalues of a 2d harmonic oscillator .",
    "for the 3d hooke profile both spectra are given by eq .",
    "( [ khooke ] ) , again with @xmath74 replaced by @xmath73 ; the agreement is perfect again .",
    "* * kepler index profile * , @xmath98 . in this case",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 , which yields the 2d wkb spectrum in the form  ( [ kmfe1 ] ) .",
    "this is at the same time also the analytical spectrum ( again the formula for @xmath0 is used also for @xmath99 ) , so again the wkb gives here the exact spectrum .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ]  ( b ) .",
    "the situation in 3d is analogous .",
    "* * 2d miano lens * , @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath98 for @xmath102 . in this case",
    "@xmath96 , @xmath85 , which yields the wkb spectrum in the form  ( [ khooke ] ) .",
    "comparison with the numerically calculated spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ]  ( c ) .",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    "* as the last example we consider a 2d ai with the refractive index @xmath103^{3/2}+[r/(2-r)]^{3/2}\\}^{-1}$ ] derived from the general formula ( 18 ) of  @xcite with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this yields for the wkb spectrum @xmath106 which again approximates the exact spectrum well , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ]  ( d ) .",
    "we see that in all these cases the agreement of the wkb spectrum with the exact one is very good , even for the lowest states .",
    "this is quite a remarkable feature of the wkb approximation that our optical situation shares with quantum mechanics .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      we will now consider the situation when the mirror is not in the evanescent , but rather in the oscillatory region , which is the case e.g.  of maxwell s fish eye mirror .",
    "suppose that the optical medium is inside the mirror , again as in the case of mfem .",
    "the upper turning point @xmath8 is then located at the mirror itself , so @xmath33 must vanish there and so for @xmath107 the wave must behave according to eq .  ( [ wcomb ] ) with @xmath108 .",
    "this means an additional constant phase factor of @xmath109 compared to eq .",
    "( [ approxcos ] ) , which then has to be added into the curly parentheses in eqs .",
    "( [ k3d ] ) and  ( [ k2d ] ) . applying this result to the 2d mfem ( for which @xmath83 , @xmath96 and @xmath110 ) , we get for the wkb spectrum @xmath111 the analytical form of the spectrum is @xmath112 this way , the wkb method gives here very good results in a similar way as for the simple maxwell s fish eye .",
    "in this paper we have developed a method for calculating frequency spectra of absolute instruments using the wkb approximation .",
    "our method is based on a the key relation  ( [ der ] ) between the optical path @xmath18 and the semiclassical phase change @xmath113 between the turning points , and on the fact that in ais of the first type the optical path @xmath18 is independent of the angular momentum .",
    "the method proved to be very efficient for describing the spectrum accurately even for the lowest levels .",
    "the results confirmed the previously derived properties of the spectra , in particular that the frequencies are strongly degenerate in ais and that they form almost equidistantly spaced groups .",
    "since these properties of the spectrum have key importance for focusing of waves by ais  @xcite , the wkb method shows that sharp focusing of rays in fact implies that waves will be focused as well . this way the wkb method provides a nice and important bridge between geometrical and wave optics of absolute instruments .",
    "we applied our method also to ais that contain mirrors ; there , the airy functions turned out to be very helpful in describing the wave in both the oscillatory and evanescent regions , and to calculate the eigenfrequency shifts caused by the mirror . when the mirror is added into the evanescent region ,",
    "it turns out that even though light rays are not influenced at all , the spectrum can be influenced strongly .",
    "in particular , the spectrum becomes less regular , which can somewhat degrade imaging by the absolute instrument . on the other hand , placing the mirror in the oscillatory region leads to a constant shift in the spectrum .",
    "it may be somewhat surprising , but certainly very satisfactory , how accurate results the wkb method gives for the spectra of absolute instruments .",
    "the situation is similar to quantum mechanics where the wkb method also gives very precise values for the energy spectrum in many situations .",
    "an interesting question for further research could be how the wkb method can be applied to ais of the second type where not all points have their full images , or to even more general devices .",
