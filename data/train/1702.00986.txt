    "_ et al.__@xcite investigated properties of defects , such as vacancies , antisites , and impurities , in @xmath1-aln . it was reported that n vacancies and si impurities lead to the breaking of the planar symmetry and cause significant changes in the electronic properties .",

    "employing ( dft)-based methods , we investigated the the structural , electronic and optical properties of monolayer @xmath1-aln and mg(oh)@xmath0 and their hetero - bilayers .",

    "brillouin zone integration was performed using a @xmath6 @xmath3-centered mesh for the primitive unit cell . to avoid interactions between adjacent monolayer and hetero - bilayers ,",
    "our calculations were performed with a large unit cell including @xmath718  vacuum space .",

    ", width=8 ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      first of all , to determine energetically favorable structure , six different stacking orders are considered . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hetero_fig](a ) , possible stacking orders are : @xmath15 ( al on mg , n on h ) , @xmath16 ( n on mg , al on h ) , @xmath17 ( al on h , n at the midpoint of three h ) , @xmath2 ( n on h , al at the midpoint of three h ) , @xmath18 ( al and n on top of midpoint of h triangles and n on mg ) , and @xmath19 ( switched of al and n form of @xmath18 ) . the energy difference between different stackings are given in table  [ hetero_table ] .",
    "in general , the hetero - bilayer has three type of properties with respect to localization of al or",
    "n on trigonal h surface of mg(oh)@xmath0 ; when n atom is on top of h atom , which means the @xmath2 and @xmath15 stacking types , the hetero - bilayers posses the lowest energies with highest binding energies .",
    "they have also similar band gap of 2.30 and 2.31 ev , respectively .",
    "the work functions are found to be 4.31 and 4.32 ev which are very close to each other . instead of these energetically favorable forms ,",
    "the minimum interlayer distances are obtained when the al and n atoms coincide to the midpoint h triangles ( @xmath19 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the band gap and work function values of the @xmath19 and @xmath19 stacking are found to be similar as well .",
    "when al is on top of h , the structures have the highest interlayer distances highest energy and lowest binding energy .",
    "the @xmath15 with @xmath2 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 with @xmath19 have similar parameters .",
    "the minimum energy of the hetero - bilayer is obtained when the layer are stacked in the form of @xmath2 stacking which exhibits the maximum interlayer interaction of 237 mev .",
    "interlayer distance , which is defined as the perpendicular distance from surface h atom to the @xmath1-aln plane , is 2.13  .",
    "the work function of mg(oh)@xmath0 side is calculated to be 4.31 ev . the vbm and cbm are at @xmath3 as in monolayer mg(oh)@xmath0 , however the band gap values of 2.30 ev within gga which are significantly low as compared to that of monolayer of @xmath1-aln and mg(oh)@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath15 stacking order is energetically very close to @xmath2 . for both @xmath2 and @xmath15 , the layer - layer interaction , interlayer distances , and also band gap values are almost same .",
    "in addition , considering vacuum level positions , formation of a staggered gap , with a mismatch of 1.02 ev at the intimate contact point of monolayers is predicted . moreover , since the minimum energy difference between the vb and cb is at @xmath3 point ( see fig .",
    "[ hetero_fig ] ( b ) ) , the lower energy optical activity takes place at this high symmetry point of brillouin zone .",
    "such a contact between two atomically - flat surfaces forms an ultra - clean type - ii heterojunction .      in this part ,",
    "the origin of the prominent excitonic peaks in the aln / mg(oh)@xmath0 hetero - bilayer structure , which corresponds to the ab@xmath20 stacking , are investigated in details .",
    "there are two effects that determine characteristic properties of exciton in two - dimensional materials : the dielectric screening and the structural confinement . in general ,",
    "when the crystal structure of a usual semiconductor is reduced from 3d to 2d , the dielectric screening between electron and hole takes place only inside layer .",
    "therefore , as a consequence of the dimensional reduction , the screening effect on electron - hole pair is lower for 2d crystals as compared to the bulk .    in fig .",
    "[ dis_osci_fig ] , we show interlayer - spacing - dependent excitonic properties to investigate the origin and evolution of the excitons by tracking their peak positions and corresponding oscillator strengths in the energy spectrum .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ dis_osci_fig ] ( a ) , starting from the interlayer spacing of 6.0  ( equilibrium distance is set to 0  ) , the first peak of the isolated mg(oh)@xmath0 splits into two different peaks due to the broken symmetry of the top and bottom surface charge densities .",
    "it is seen that the first peak of the bilayer structure , * i@xmath21 * , appears at the lower energy level than the first peak of both individual @xmath1-aln and mg(oh)@xmath0 .",
    "as calculated in the previous section , the vbm and cbm electronic states are mainly formed by the o and n , respectively .",
    "therefore , the first peak of the bilayer heterostructure , * i@xmath21 * , corresponds to a spatially indirect exciton in which the electron localizes at the n of @xmath1-aln and the hole is at o of mg(oh)@xmath0 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ dis_osci_fig ] ( b ) , the reduction in the oscillator strength of * i@xmath21 * ( minimum of all ) at around 3.0  , reveals that electronic state of mg(oh)@xmath0 at the intimate contact surface overlaps with @xmath1-aln layer as the distance decreases .",
    "however , at the optimum interlayer distance , other mg(oh)@xmath0-originated exciton state evolves into the second peak of the heterostructure labeled as * ii@xmath21*. apparently , the electronic state of * ii@xmath21 * exciton peak originates from the outer surface state of mg(oh)@xmath0 .    on the other hand , the origin and interlayer - spacing - dependence of * iii@xmath21 * , differs from those of * i@xmath21 * and * ii@xmath21*. firstly , in fig .",
    "[ dis_osci_fig ] , it is evident that by decreasing interlayer spacing the first excitonic peak of @xmath1-aln crystal gradually evolves into third state of hetero - bilayer , labeled as * iii@xmath21*. it is seen from figs .  [ dis_osci_fig ] ( a ) and ( b ) that the shape and the oscillator strength of the * iii@xmath21 * do not change significantly .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the characteristic properties of the * iii@xmath21 * are almost same with the first excitonic state of @xmath1-aln monolayer crystal .",
    "when the distance decrease under 4.0  , a significant charge distribution appears on the o atom .",
    "it appears that the screening on the @xmath1-aln increases when the mg(oh)@xmath0 layers become closer .",
    "therefore as a consequence of decrease in exciton binding energy corresponding peak shows a significant blue shift .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) the imaginary part of the dielectric functions of the @xmath2 stacked hetero - bilayer are shown for different interlayer distances starting from ground state distance of 2.13  .",
    "@xmath22 refers to interlayer distance while the ground state distance is set to 0 and labeled as 0.0  .",
    "the lowest three exciton peaks are labeled as * i@xmath21 * , * ii@xmath21 * , and * iii@xmath21*. ( b ) the distance dependent oscillator strengths of lowest three excitons are shown .",
    "color code is given .",
    "the position of the prominent peaks are illustrated by shaded curves .",
    "the length of the out - of - plane lattice vector is fixed for different interlayer distance .",
    ", width=8 ]        for a deeper understanding of nature of excitonic states of the vdw mg(oh)@xmath0/@xmath1-aln heterostructure we also investigate the band decomposed charge densities and exctionic wave functions . in fig .",
    "[ chg_dis ] ( a ) , the interlayer - spacing - dependent band decomposed charge densities of the first and second lowest levels of the cb at @xmath3 point are shown .",
    "the lowest and second lowest levels are labeled as cb-@xmath23 and cb-@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the changes in the charge densities of these two levels contain remarkable informations about the evolution of the electrons involved in the states * i@xmath21 * , * ii@xmath21 * , and * iii@xmath21*.    firstly , when the distance is 6.0  , the charge density shown in cb-@xmath24 part of the fig .  [ chg_dis ] ( a ) corresponds to the charge density at the cbm of individual mg(oh)@xmath0 .",
    "it is seen that this density appears mostly on o atoms and also at the surfaces of the mg(oh)@xmath0 .",
    "as the interlayer distance decreases , the charge density vanishes at the inner surface and increases at the outer surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the density shown in the cb-@xmath23 for the interlayer distance of 6.0  corresponds to the charge density at the cbm of individual @xmath1-aln .",
    "as the distance decreases , charge changes negligibly at the vicinity of @xmath1-aln but an additional charge density appears on inner o atom when the distance is less than 4.0  .",
    "it appears that when the layers approach each other , the inner surface electron of the mg(oh)@xmath0 is transfered to the @xmath1-aln and the outer surface electron states of the mg(oh)@xmath0 remains at its original position .",
    "furthermore , we also calculate the real space exciton localizations by using the methodology given in appendix [ wavefunc ] .",
    "the wave functions of the * i@xmath21 * , * ii@xmath21 * , and * iii@xmath21 * are shown in fig .  [ chg_dis ]",
    "( b ) where the yellow regions correspond to electrons and the black points stand for holes .",
    "as shown in the lower panel , it is evident that the * i@xmath21 * is the spatially indirect exciton in which the electron and hole localize on the @xmath1-aln and mg(oh)@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the * ii@xmath21 * localizes at the outer side of the mg(oh)@xmath0 as shown in middle panel of the fig .",

    "[ chg_dis ] ( b ) stays mostly on the @xmath1-aln .",
    "a small portion of the * iii@xmath21 * appears on the hydroxide regions of the mg(oh)@xmath0 .",
    "in this study , structural , electronic , and optical properties of the recently synthesized novel 2d materials of @xmath1-aln and mg(oh)@xmath0 and their bilayer heterostructure are investigated by performing dft calculation .",
    "the excitonic states are also calculated by solving bse over the @xmath25 approximation on top of dft .",
    "our investigation revealed that : ( i ) the individual monolayer of the @xmath1-aln and mg(oh)@xmath0 can form a vertically stacked hetero - bilayer , ( ii ) when the hetero - bilayer formed , although the interlayer interaction is weak novel exciton states appear , ( iii ) while @xmath1-aln - states have weak spacing dependence , mg(oh)@xmath0 states are strongly affected by the presence of a neighboring layer , ( iv ) exponential increase in screening of mg(oh)@xmath0 on @xmath1-aln - states was also predicted , ( v ) while the first exciton peak is a spatially indirect one , the second and third exciton states are spatially direct states .",
    "although the constituents have limited optical activity , the heterostructure shows unexpected optical properties .",
    "in particular , @xmath1-aln - mg(oh)@xmath0 hetero - bilayer exhibits spatially indirect excitons which is important for the optoelectronic application , especially based on photoexcited electron collecting .",
