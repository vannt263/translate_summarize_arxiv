    "time - correlated and entangled photon pairs have been an important resource for a wide range of quantum optics experiments , ranging from fundamental tests @xcite to applications in quantum communication , cryptography , teleportation and computation  @xcite .",
    "the first sources of correlated photon pairs were based on a cascade decay in neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "the cascade imposes a time correlation , and with an appropriate choice of the geometry and intermediate states it is possible to observe a strong non - classical correlation in the polarization of the photons .",
    "these sources are rarely used today in quantum optics experiments for their limited generation rates , and have been superseded by schemes based on three - wave mixing in non - linear optical crystals , or four - wave mixing ( fwm ) in optical fibers @xcite . to obtain a narrow optical bandwidth",
    ", it is possible to use near - resonant transitions in atoms to provide the large third order nonlinear susceptibility for efficient fwm , leading to photon pairs with a central wavelength matching those of the transitions involved  @xcite .",
    "these sources are a hybrid between the traditional atomic cascade approaches , and those based on three- or four - wave mixing in solids in the sense that they deliver both a useful pair rate collected into single mode optical fibers , and exhibit interesting temporal correlations .    in this paper , we present the characterization of a source of time - correlated and polarization - entangled photon pairs based on four - wave mixing in a cold cloud of @xmath0rb atoms .",
    "the involved atomic levels , selected by the choice of pump and target wavelengths , form a cascade decay scheme , providing an asymmetrical time correlation similar to the one from the cascade decay of single atoms .",
    "entanglement between photons can be established in several degrees of freedom like time bins , polarization , and orbital angular momentum @xcite , with polarization entanglement having been extensively studied due to its robustness and the availability of very stable optical elements for manipulating and detecting the polarization of single photons  @xcite .",
    "observation of photon polarization entanglement begin with early photon pair sources based on cascade decays in atomic beams  @xcite , followed by spontaneous parametric down conversion in nonlinear optical crystals  @xcite , cold  @xcite and hot  @xcite atomic vapors , and recently also in cascade emission from quantum dots  @xcite . in this paper",

    "a first interference filter ( if@xmath1 ) combines the two pump beams in a co - propagating geometry inside the cloud , a second one ( if@xmath2 ) separates the signal and idler photons from residual pump light .",
    "the pump polarizations can be freely chosen with polarizers ( p ) and quarter wave plates ( q ) . a stack of quarter wave plate , half wave plate ( h ) , and polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) in each collection mode can select any arbitrary polarization .",

    "the experimental setup is similar to our earlier work  @xcite , but uses a collinear beam geometry ( see figure  [ fig : schematic ] ) .",

    "the atoms are excited from @xmath6s@xmath10 to @xmath6d@xmath11 via a two - photon transition , with a two - photon detuning of @xmath12mhz .",
    "pump beams of wavelength 795 nm and 762 nm overlap in a co - propagating geometry inside the cloud .",
    "the 795 nm pump is red detuned by 30mhz from the intermediate level @xmath6p@xmath7 to reduce the incoherent scattering rate . from the @xmath6d@xmath11 excited level",
    ", atoms can decay through several paths .",
    "we select `` signal '' photons around 776 nm , and `` idler '' photons around 780 nm with interference filters of 3 nm fwhm bandwidth . within this bandwidth ,",
    "two decays can be observed ( figure  [ fig : schematic ] , top right ) : decay @xmath3 through the hyperfine level @xmath6p@xmath11 , and @xmath4 going through @xmath6p@xmath13 .    energy conservation and phase matching results in the generation of signal and idler photon pairs from both decay paths with a frequency difference of @xmath14=266mhz corresponding to the hyperfine splitting of the intermediate level .",
    "the generated photons are collected into single - mode fibers and detected by avalanche photodetectors ( quantum efficiency @xmath1540% , jitter time @xmath151ns ) . in the experiment ,",

    "we investigate the polarization state of the photon pairs for decay paths @xmath3 and @xmath4 independently .",
    "we select light in the signal mode ( see figure  [ fig : schematic ] ) using a 2 cm long solid fused silica etalon with a transmission bandwidth of 52mhz ( fwhm ) .",
    "the etalon is temperature - tuned to match to the resonance frequency of either the @xmath6p@xmath18d@xmath9 or @xmath6p@xmath19d@xmath9 transition ; its temperature is stabilized to within 1mk to minimize frequency drifts .",
    "we completely characterize the polarization state of photon pairs via quantum state tomography  @xcite by projective detections of individual photons in a combination of linear and circular polarizations . for this",
    ", we insert quarter and half wave plates ( q , h ) followed by beam splitter cubes ( pbs ) in the signal and idler modes . figure  [ fig : tomo ] shows the real part of the reconstructed biphoton states @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponding to decay paths @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "the values of these indicators are given in table  [ tab : pol ] .",
    ".[tab : pol ] entanglement indicators for reconstructed states @xmath28 .",
    "the uncertainties reflect propagated poissonian counting statistics of contributing coincidence events . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     despite the fact that the atomic ensemble is not prepared in a particular zeeman sublevel , the polarization states for photon pairs from both decay paths show a remarkably high purity .",
    "this is compatible with theoretical models presented in  @xcite , which we briefly summarize here .    in a cascade decay ,",
    "polarization entanglement arises from indistinguishable decay paths , in our case provided by sufficiently degenerate zeeman states of each hyperfine level . with the quantization axis along the beam propagation direction of all modes , we only drive transitions with @xmath29 with orthogonally circularly polarized pump beams . in parametric processes",
    "@xcite , the quantum state of the medium remains unchanged through the interaction  @xcite .",
    "further , rotational symmetry of the atomic cloud in beam propagation direction implies angular momentum conservation .",
    "along with the angular momentum selection rules , this limits the possible polarizations of the generated signal - idler photon pairs to @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "since the process is coherent and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are indistinguishable otherwise , the resulting state @xmath32 of a target mode photon pair can be written as @xmath33 the probability amplitudes @xmath34 and the phase @xmath35 can be derived using a model based on the relative transition strength between different zeeman sublevels  @xcite as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the helicities of the signal and idler photons , and @xmath38 is the product of relevant clebsh - gordan coefficients  @xcite that couple the individual @xmath39 states of the different hyperfine levels involved in the four - wave mixing process , and @xmath40 where @xmath41 corresponding to the respective total angular momentum @xmath42 of the participating levels . from ( [ eq : poltomo ] ) , we obtain the expected state @xmath43 for the decay path @xmath3 .",

    "both decay paths exhibit different decay time constants due to different transition strengths for the decays .",
    "the transition @xmath6p@xmath9 to @xmath6s@xmath7 is 2.8 times stronger than from @xmath6p@xmath50  @xcite .",
    "this results in a higher optical density ( od ) for the @xmath51 transition  @xcite , and should lead to a faster decay via path @xmath3  @xcite . to experimentally investigate this ,",
    "we perform separate time correlation measurements between the detection of signal and idler photons for each decay path .",
    "the histogram of coincidence events as a function of time delay @xmath49 between the detection of signal and idler photons sampled into 1ns wide time bins is shown in figure  [ fig : decaytime ] .",
    "the solid line in both cases shows a fit to a heuristic model , inspired by the joint effect of a decay time corresponding to the two - photon transition  @xcite , and the effect of a finite ring - down time of the filter etalon : @xmath52 for path @xmath3 , we obtain a decay constant @xmath53=5.6@xmath54ns for an idler photon heralded by a signal photon . in the same way , with the etalon tuned to transmit the resonance frequency of the @xmath6p@xmath50@xmath8 @xmath6d@xmath9 transition for path @xmath4 , we find @xmath55= 13.1@xmath56ns .",
    "both decay constants @xmath57 are shorter than the spontaneous decay time @xmath58ns of the @xmath6p@xmath59 level of a single rubidium atom in free space due to the collective enhancement effects observed in an optically thick atomic ensemble .",
    "the rise time @xmath60ns for decay path @xmath3 and @xmath61ns for @xmath4 is a consequence of the finite response time of the etalon .",
    "both values are compatible with the value of @xmath62ns obtained in an independent characterization of the etalon .",
    "without the etalon ( see figure  [ fig : schematic ] ) , the decay paths @xmath3 and @xmath4 can not be distinguished by wideband photodetectors . consequently , the energy difference between photons from the two paths leads to a modulation of the time correlation function between signal and idler photodetection , as shown in figure  [ fig : interference_beats ] .",
    "this , and other similar phenomena , is known as quantum beats : it was predicted at an early stage of quantum physics  @xcite , and first experimentally observed in pulsed optical excitation of atoms with two upper states decaying to the same ground state  @xcite .",
    "quantum beats have also been observed in cascade decay systems of dilute atomic vapours  @xcite , dense thermal atomic vapours  @xcite , and for single ions  @xcite .",
    "coincidences as a function of the time delay between the detection of signal and idler photons , with no etalon in the signal mode .",
    "pump 1 and 2 are set to orthogonal linear polarization @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , and signal and idler are projected onto the polarization states @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the observed modulation ( `` quantum beat '' ) is associated with the hyperfine splitting of 266mhz between @xmath67 and @xmath68 of the @xmath69 level . to resolve the oscillations with high contrast , avalanche photodetectors with a low time jitter ( @xmath1540ps ) were used for this measurement . due to the lower quantum efficiency of these detectors ,",
    "the total acquisition time is 5 hours . ]",
    "coincidence rate as a function of time delay between the detection of signal and idler photons for different choices of polarization of signal and idler photons .",
    "( a ) the beats are damped by choosing the appropriate polarizations due to suppression of coincidences from decay path @xmath4 .",

    "the measurements shown in figure  [ fig : interference_beats ] are performed with polarization of pump 1 and 2 set to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , and polarizations of signal and idler modes are set to observe a large interference contrast .    to model the interference between the different decay paths , we take into account the different coherence time of the emitted photon pairs , characterized by the time constants @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and the relative difference in the generation amplitude @xmath79 , and phase @xmath80 .",
    "these last two terms can be calculated via ( [ eq : poltomo ] ) .",
    "we express the probability amplitudes @xmath81 for paths @xmath3 and @xmath4 as function of the detection time difference @xmath49 between signal and idler photons , @xmath82 which interfere to a joint detection probability @xmath83.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the measured coherence times @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 calculated from the interaction strengths of the transitions , we fit the experimental data in figure  [ fig : interference_beats ] using ( [ eq : model ] ) with only @xmath84 and an accidental count rate as free parameters , and find a good agreement with this relatively simple model .",
    "different interaction strengths for the different polarizations in the participating levels allow control of the relative amplitude and phase of the possible decay paths .",
    "we can observe the dependence of the amplitude of the oscillation on the polarization settings and compare it with the expected values calculated from the interaction strengths of the transitions . in figure",
    "[ fig : beats_phase ] we present three different cases , all fitted in a similar way as for figure  [ fig : interference_beats ] .",
    "of particular interest is the case where the beats are almost entirely suppressed [ figure  [ fig : beats_phase](a ) ] , an indication that most of the photon pairs observed are generated by the @xmath3 decay .",
    "figure  [ fig : beats_phase](b ) and ( c ) show the situation for polarization selections that lead to quantum beats with a high contrast , but opposite phases .",
    "this demonstrates that it is possible to select one frequency component only by an appropriate choice of polarizations , without using an etalon .",
    "however , it is not possible to select only photon pairs from the @xmath4 decay in a similar manner due to the relative weakness of the transitions involving the @xmath6p@xmath50 level .",
    "in summary , we have characterized the polarization entangled state of photon pairs from a cold cloud of atoms by performing quantum state tomography , individually for two decay paths of the cascade .",
    "we find that the resulting polarization - entangled states for both decay paths are not maximally entangled , but reasonably close to it .",
    "this is compatible with a model combining the transition strengths between different participating intermediate states in the four - wave mixing process .",
    "we observe high - contrast quantum beats in a time correlation measurement between the generated photon pairs .",
    "the contrast and the initial phase of beats can be controlled with the choice of polarization of pumps and projective measurements on the generated photons ."
