    "sufficiently cold and dense quark matter has a rich phase structure ; during the last decade , significant advances have been made in our understandings of color superconductivity @xcite . at asymptotically large quark density ,",

    "however , it turned out that the 2sc / g2sc phases suffers from a chromomagnetic instability , indicated by a negative meissner masses squared of some gluons @xcite . in the two - flavor case ( and at zero temperature ) , gluons of adjoint color 8 have a tachyonic meissner mass in the region where the gap @xmath3 is less than the chemical potential mismatch @xmath4 , @xmath5 . on the other hand , the more severe instability related to gluons 47 emerges in the region @xmath6",

    "we calculate the effective potential of the 2sc / g2sc phases including the vector condensates @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the meissner masses squared in the 2sc / g2sc phases are computed from the curvature of the effective potential with respect to the vector condensates .",
    "the potential curvature in the direction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 corresponds to the meissner mass squared of gluons of color 47 and 8 , respectively .",
    "we also present the phase diagram in the plane of temperature and diquark coupling strength and map out the unstable regions for gluons 47 and 8 on the phase diagram .",

    "in particular , the g2sc phase suffers from a severe instability related to both gluons 47 and 8 .",
    "[ figure10 ] , we illustrate the temperature dependence of the meissner masses squared @xmath125 and @xmath91 for the cases of @xmath126 mev .",
    "it is clear that at least one of the the meissner masses in the 2sc / g2sc phases is imaginary at low temperatures and both meissner masses squared become positive at @xmath121 mev . ) for strong couplings @xmath127 , the system gets rid of the chromomagnetic instability .",
    "note that one still finds a stable g2sc phase in the high - temperature region in the phase diagram , though the gapless structure is not significant at high temperature .",
    "we studied the chromomagnetic instability in two - flavor quark matter at nonzero temperature .",
    "we use the gauged njl model and first analyzed the curvature of the effective potential .",
    "then , a temperature - dependent subtraction for the meissner masses squared was introduced , so that magnetic gluons remain unscreened in the normal phase . as mentioned earlier , this temperature dependence is indeed the cutoff artifact . in this work",
    ", we studied the properties of the chromomagnetic instability in the intermediate and strong coupling regimes , using a phenomenological four - fermi interaction .",
    "therefore , we used a temperature - dependent subtraction and , accordingly , the ad hoc normalization of the effective potential .",
    "it should be emphasized that , for our standard value of the njl cutoff , the temperature dependence of the subtraction term is not negligibly small actually .",
    "we calculated the temperature dependence of the meissner masses squared as a function of @xmath53 and found that , at @xmath77 , the instability related to gluons 47 and 8 is washed out at all values of @xmath53 .",
    "we also confirmed the temperature - induced instability ( i.e. , the growth of the critical point at @xmath92 ) for the 8th gluon . in order to look at the temperature dependence of the meissner masses squared , we computed not only the potential curvature but also the effective potential itself as a function of the vector condensates @xmath0 and @xmath1 . evaluating",
    "the effective potential played a crucial role for understanding the temperature - induced instability for the 8th gluon . by comparing the free energies of the 2sc phase and the single plane - wave loff state",
    ", we clarified that the induced instability mainly arises from the fact that the 2sc phase in the region slightly above the gapless onset is only metastable at @xmath54 .",
    "we also presented the phase diagram in the @xmath61-@xmath103 plane and mapped out the unstable regions for gluons 47 and 8 on the phase diagram .",
    "we found that , apart from the case of strong coupling , the 2sc / g2sc phases at low temperatures @xmath128 suffer from a severe instability related to both gluons 47 and 8 and a large region in the g2sc phase should be replaced by the vector condensed phases .    in calculating the effective potential",
    ", we did not enforce the neutrality condition .",
    "hence , the effective potential shown in figs .",
    "[ figure2 ] , [ figure3 ] , [ figure6 ] and [ figure7 ] might be altered by the neutrality constraint .",
    "the result for the loff state ( fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) should be taken as an indication that the neutral 2sc phase is not stable against the formation of the loff state even before @xmath53 reaches the gapless onset and that a first - order transition ( 2sc @xmath129 loff ) occurs at a certain value of @xmath130 .",
    "however , they must remain true even if we take into account the neutrality condition . at @xmath54 ,",
    "a neutral loff state was studied by solving the gap equations for @xmath3 and @xmath80 and the neutrality condition for @xmath23 self - consistently and it was revealed that the loff state is indeed favored over the 2sc phase even above the gapless onset ( the edge of the loff state with the 2sc phase was determined to be @xmath131 @xcite ) . in addition , fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates such a first - order transition actually happens . at @xmath92 , although we did not examine the low - temperature effective potential of the loff state , it is likely that the first - order transition ( 2sc @xmath129 loff above the gapless onset ) takes place as long as @xmath61 is not too high .",
    "let us look at the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] again .",
    "( we should recall that the region where the 2sc is metastable is not depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] . ) as we mentioned above , there exists a window where the loff state is energetically more favored than the 2sc phase , even though @xmath132 in the 2sc phase . the actual phase boundary ( 2sc @xmath129 loff ) , as a consequence , shifts to larger @xmath103 s when we solve the set of equations self - consistently and take account of the metastability of the 2sc phase .",
    "in addition , the nq phase in the weak coupling regime will be replaced by the neutral loff state .",
    "at @xmath54 , in fact , it was found that the neutral loff state exists in the window @xmath133 and that it is more stable than the nq phase in whole this window @xcite .",
    "the weakly coupled loff state survives at nonzero temperature and , presumably , undergoes a phase transition into the g2sc phase or the nq phase @xcite .",
    "then , we conclude that , apart from the case of strong coupling , the low - temperature ( @xmath128 ) region of a chromomagnetically stable , non color - flavor - locked phase has a completely different structure from known phase diagrams .",
    "the most interesting remaining task is now clear : we have to take into account all the possible gluonic condensates and calculate the free energy in a self - consistent manner . ( in particular , we have a limited knowledge of the gluonic phase @xcite . while suggestive , it is not sufficient for drawing a conclusion about the phase structure of the gluonic phase . )",
    "the resulting gluonic - condensed phase will be free from the chromomagnetic instability . here , it should be noted that the study of the effective potential shows that the meissner masses squared itself can not be a criteria for choosing the ground state , in other words , the small-@xmath134 expansion of the effective potential does not work .",
    "it is also interesting to make a ( free energy ) comparison between the gluonic - condensed phase and the loff state with realistic crystal structures .",
    "finally , the gluonic - condensed phase has not been studied in the three - flavor case , so an extension to the realistic three - flavor quark matter would have important implications for the physics of compact stars .",
    "the author would like to thank igor shovkovy for fruitful discussion and dirk rischke for comment on the earlier version of the manuscript .",
