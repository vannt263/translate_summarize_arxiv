    "the epoch of cosmic reionization , when the intergalactic hydrogen in the universe transitioned from neutral to ionized , is the current frontier of observational cosmology .",
    "qsos discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) indicate that reionization was just finishing at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "recent results from the _ wmap _ satellite suggest that significant reionization of the universe took place by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the sources that reionized the universe , however , are still unknown : at @xmath10 neither bright qsos discovered by sdss @xcite nor faint agn from deep x - ray observations @xcite produced enough photons to reionize the universe .",
    "other evidence from the temperature and ionization state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) suggests that , though qsos dominated the meta - galactic ionizing background at @xmath11 , the spectrum was softer at reionization ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "accordingly , hot stars in early star - forming systems may have been the dominant source of reionizing photons .",
    "one goal of the forthcoming nasa / esa _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) ,",
    "a 6-meter ir telescope scheduled for launch in 2010 , is to study the formation of the first generations of galaxies and their contribution to reionization @xcite .",
    "early galaxies played many important roles beyond their involvement with reionization .",
    "the igm was enriched well above the primordial metal abundance by @xmath12 @xcite ; additional evidence for early metal production comes from metal - poor globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "age estimates imply a formation epoch of @xmath13 for current cosmological parameters @xcite , but the typical metallicity of these objects is @xmath14 of the solar value @xcite",
    ". the stars responsible for reionization and early metal production may still be present in some form today .",
    "it is an important challenge to identify the transition between the very first , metal - free , stars , and stars , because of the strong constraints on the metallicity of low - mass stars provided by studies of halo stars in the milky way .",
    "a complete understanding of the metallicity distribution of old galactic stars will benefit from direct observation of very high redshift star formation in _ proto - galactic systems that will evolve into galaxies like the milky way_.    in advance of _ jwst _ , which will use ir capabilities to observe galaxies before the end of reionization in rest - frame uv and optical light , current ground - based facilities have the opportunity to discover and characterize star - forming galaxies near the epoch of reionization with rest - frame uv observations .",
    "in particular , the identification of lyman  @xmath0  emission from star - forming regions of early galaxies has proven to be a powerful tool for discovering @xmath15 galaxies and measuring their redshifts ( see section  [ sec : lyasur ] ) .",
    "the redshift range @xmath16 is of particular interest for two reasons .",
    "one is that the very detection of lyman  @xmath0  emission may place a constraint on the progress of reionization @xcite : it is difficult to observe lyman  @xmath0emission from galaxies embedded in a neutral igm , but the strength of the constraint derived from the successful detection of lyman  @xmath0  depends on the assumed properties of the sources @xcite .",
    "the second important reason to study galaxy formation during and after reionization is that an intense uv background and @xmath17  k igm is predicted to suppress star - formation in galaxies that form after reionization @xcite .",
    "there is a discrepancy between some theoretical predictions of the abundance of dark matter halos on dwarf - galaxy mass scales and the number of observed dwarf satellites in the local group @xcite .",
    "reionization may sterilize many dwarf galaxy - scale halos to star formation , so that the luminous satellites of the milky way are dwarf galaxies formed before reionization , and the remaining satellite halos are empty of stars and thus dark @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the results of a spectroscopic lyman  @xmath0  emission - line survey for galaxies at @xmath18 that utilizes the strong - lensing properties of intermediate - redshift clusters to magnify the surveyed regions . in section  [ sec : lyasur ] we review the use of lyman  @xmath0surveys as probes of early star formation .",
    "section  [ sec : lowlum ] motivates the importance of surveys for low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes the advantages of a survey utilizing strong lensing and details our survey strategy , targets , observations , and data reduction . in section  [ sec : detect ] our lyman  @xmath0emission - line detections are presented .",
    "we compute our survey volume and source number density in section  [ sec : suranal ] .",
    "section  [ sec : comp ] compares the results of our survey to other surveys and theoretical models . in section",
    "[ sec : sum ] we summarize .",
    "throughout this paper we use a @xmath19cdm cosmological model with ( @xmath20)=(@xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ; these values are consistent with the values derived in @xcite .",
    "the primary appeal of lyman  @xmath0  emission as a signpost to high - redshift galaxy formation is that it traces star formation at a wavelength that conveniently redshifts into the visible and near - ir , where sensitive , high - angular resolution observations are currently most practical",
    ". the lyman  @xmath0  emission line may be quite strong , but its luminosity is quite sensitive to physical details of the nature and geometry of the star - forming regions .",
    "because lyman  @xmath0  emission traces hydrogen recombinations , it is intimately related to the production of ionizing photons by the stars present .",
    "both the initial mass function ( imf ) and metallicity of the stars affect their production rate of ionizing photons .",
    "however , if the imf and metallicity are constrained to reasonable ranges , the ionizing photon production rate can be reliably connected to the star - formation rate .",
    "the major complication for the interpretation of lyman  @xmath0  line strengths is the effect of the nebula around the star - forming region .",
    "hydrogen at low density does not recombine quickly , so , e.g. , ionizing photons that escape into the igm are `` lost '' for the purposes of producing a lyman  @xmath0  emission line . even after a hydrogen recombination produces a lyman  @xmath0  photon , which happens for about two thirds of the recombinations @xcite ,",
    "there are many ways in which the photon may be destroyed prior to escape .",
    "the resonant nature of the lyman  @xmath0transition results in a very short mean free path , even in a mostly ionized nebula .",
    "consequently , if dust is mixed in with the gas , then the chance of absorption by a dust grain may be higher for a lyman  @xmath0photon than a non - resonantly scattered photon at the same wavelength ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an alternative ) .",
    "the dust content of very high - redshift galaxies is still relatively unconstrained , and will likely remain so at least until _ jwst_.    on the positive side , lyman  @xmath0  is the intrinsically strongest recombination line from an h ii region .",
    "another meritorious aspect of lyman  @xmath0  is that its emission strength does not strongly depend on the metallicity of the ionized gas ( the only effect is from the temperature of the photoionized gas , which depends on metallicity ) ; consequently , it can be used as a tracer for truly primordial star formation , where dust extinction is also believed not to be a problem .",
    "@xcite introduced a model of galaxy formation `` to assess the general possibility of observing distant , newly formed , galaxies . '' in their model they estimated that 67% of the luminosity of early galaxies would be emitted in the lyman  @xmath0  emission line : they predicted line luminosities of @xmath23 over galaxy formation time - scales of @xmath24  yr . the predictions of @xcite and others led to many observational surveys for lyman  @xmath0emission from high - redshift galaxies , reviewed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarized the status of searches at that time with `` no emission line primeval galaxies have been found '' despite 16 cited surveys covering various redshifts ranges from @xmath25 to @xmath12 . in striking contrast to these pioneering explorations , many high - redshift lyman  @xmath0  emission - line galaxies",
    "have been discovered and confirmed in the past 8 years . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have reviewed recent progress , and we provide a brief summary here .",
    "the search technique that has dominated recent success in the discovery of large numbers of lyman  @xmath0  emission - line galaxies at @xmath15 is narrow - band photometry .",
    "this approach uses a narrow ( @xmath26   ) filter chosen to lie in a spectral region of low sky background ; such surveys cover relatively large areas of sky with sensitivity to lyman  @xmath0emission over a small window in redshift , @xmath27 .",
    "many groups have now performed successful blind narrow - band surveys for @xmath15 galaxies : @xcite and @xcite at @xmath28 ; @xcite at @xmath29 ; @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite at @xmath30 ; and @xcite and @xcite at @xmath31 .",
    "spectroscopic surveys provide a complementary technique to the narrow - band method . for equal observing time at one position",
    ", spectroscopic searches at optical wavelengths can cover a large range in redshift , @xmath32 , to better line flux sensitivity than a corresponding narrow - band survey .",
    "however , the area surveyed by a long slit is typically @xmath33 , in contrast to 202000  @xmath34 for an imaging camera .",
    "deep long slit observations of other targets have been searched for serendipitous detection of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "these techniques discovered the first confirmed @xmath35 galaxy @xcite and subsequently turned up a few more @xmath15 sources @xcite .",
    "serendipitous surveys will likely continue to play a role in discovering high - redshift galaxies , since the deepest spectra on the largest telescopes are likely to be pointed observations rather than devoted emission - line surveys .    under sky - limited conditions , it is simple to show that the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath36 that is reached on pure emission - line sources of flux @xmath37 in a survey over sky area @xmath38 and wavelength range @xmath19 , with area and wavelength coverage @xmath39 and @xmath40 , seeing disk @xmath41 and spectral resolution @xmath42 , is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the lengths of individual exposures , and of the whole survey , respectively , and @xmath46 is the sky surface brightness per unit wavelength . the tradeoff is thus between the number of seeing elements that can be observed simultaneously ( @xmath47 in case of an imaging survey , @xmath48 for a long - slit spectral survey ) vs.  the number of spectral elements ( 1 for a narrow - band survey , @xmath48 for a spectral survey ) .",
    "as each is limited by detector sizes , both modes can in principle offer comparable survey speed to a given flux limit ( the argument applies also to surveys with integral field unit spectrographs ) .",
    "spectral surveys are advantageous for targeting small regions of the sky and covering a large wavelength range , or for simply going as deep as possible in a given amount of time ; narrow - band surveys are optimal in the opposite regime of wide area , small wavelength range .",
    "a further advantage of high - spectral resolution surveys is that the night sky emission lines can be maximally avoided , which is not possible with the typical bandwidths employed in narrow - band surveys .",
    "a few other hybrid techniques combine aspects of the narrow - band imaging and long - slit spectroscopy approaches .",
    "@xcite used an imaging fabry - perot interferometer to take sequences of narrow band images within the night - sky windows corresponding to @xmath49 , and have confirmed discoveries at @xmath50 and 5.7 .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite used a `` slit - let '' slit mask with a narrow - band filter to do spectroscopic surveys over a relatively large areas and narrow redshift windows .",
    "there is also an ongoing _ hst _ program to use slitless spectroscopy with the acs camera grism to discover high - redshift lyman  @xmath0  emission ( j. e. rhoads , priv .",
    "in this section we present the motivation for conducting a survey devoted specifically to low - luminosity @xmath51 lyman  @xmath0  emitting galaxies ( @xmath52 in the lyman  @xmath0  line ) , an unexplored region of survey parameter space .    at @xmath53 , the luminous lyman  @xmath0  galaxies (  [ sec : lyasur ] ) and",
    "qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) discovered so far represent the rarest and most spectacular tail of the range of structure formation scales ( e.g. , @xcite suggested that the high-@xmath54 sdss qsos reside in @xmath55 virialized halos ) .",
    "they almost certainly evolve into the rarest and most massive environments in the local universe : rich clusters of galaxies . in striking contrast ,",
    "the characteristic mass of virialized halos at @xmath51 is only @xmath56m@xmath57 ; if such an object steadily converts its @xmath58m@xmath57 of baryons into stars , it will have a star - formation rate of only @xmath59 .",
    "these objects , which we will refer to as low - mass halos , would not be detectable in any of the surveys cited above , but our understanding of galaxy formation depends crucially on constraining their properties for three important reasons : first , they represent the most common environment _ by mass _ of virialized halos ( the peak of the mass - weighted mass function is always near the characteristic mass ) ; consequently , if low - mass halos form stars efficiently , they could dominate the star - formation rate at high redshift .",
    "second , they are the progenitors of common galaxies in poor environments , like the milky way , under the current paradigm of structure formation .",
    "the detection of low - mass sources is a direct test of the `` bottom - up '' description of galaxy assembly .",
    "third , low - mass objects have a unique link to the igm : kinetic energy injected into the igm by photoionization at @xmath60 is expected to raise the cosmic jeans mass and inhibit gas cooling ; this effect has no consequence for the brightest sources residing in deep potential wells , but may heavily suppress star formation in @xmath56m@xmath57 objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this jeans - mass effect has been cited as the solution for the cold dark matter `` crisis '' of over - predicting the number of milky way satellite galaxies compared to observation @xcite .",
    "low - mass halos also place relevant constraints on the energy scale of dark matter in warm dark matter models ( z. haiman , priv . comm . ) .",
    "a practical and strategic advantage in characterizing the luminosity function at low luminosities is to determine the optimum survey depth for future surveys that aim to discover large numbers of @xmath61 galaxies .",
    "if the luminosity function were very steep , then deep surveys such as ours would be more efficient than shallower , wider field surveys .",
    "theoretical prejudice suggests that the luminosity function should have a steep effective slope in the region associated with the exponential cut - off of the number density of underlying halos , assuming some sort of mass - to - luminosity correspondence .",
    "previous non - detections combined with recent successes seem to bear this out ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and see below ) .",
    "that is , current surveys may be approaching the characteristic luminosity ; however , the characteristic luminosity and luminosity function shape have yet to be well constrained . in the local universe ,",
    "luminosity functions based on star - formation rate estimators such as h@xmath0 luminosity roughly follow the schechter function @xcite form of power - law behavior at low luminosity , reflecting the underlying power - law of the mass function , albeit with possibly a different slope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted suppression of star formation in halos with small potential wells suggests that the lyman  @xmath0  luminosity function at @xmath62 may have a modified shape .",
    "the reason is that the characteristic mass scale where the exponential tail and power law regions of the mass scale meet , @xmath63 , corresponds quite closely to the mass scale where a number of physical mechanisms may suppress star formation .",
    "we described the effect of a hot igm above .",
    "in addition , energy injected in the ism of star - forming galaxies by stellar winds and supernovae ( called `` negative feedback , '' or just `` feedback '' ) is predicted to heavily suppress star formation in halos with circular velocities below about @xmath64 @xcite , corresponding to a mass scale at @xmath53 of @xmath65 .",
    "a current implementation of feedback by @xcite shows the importance of feedback on the high - redshift star - formation rate .",
    "this effect complements the inhibiting effects of a hot igm on star formation in low - mass halos .",
    "a third mechanism that may reduce star formation preferentially in low - mass halos is the effect of large - scale winds blown by star - forming galaxies . @xcite and",
    "@xcite computed the influence of winds blown out through the igm by the first galaxies to form .",
    "they concluded that these winds effectively sweep gas out of nearby halos in the process of collapsing , meaning that even though the dark matter continues its collapse to virialization , there is little corresponding star formation because of the lack of baryons . in their model winds",
    "influence the entire star - formation history of the universe , but at @xmath53 particularly suppress star - formation in halos smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "figure  [ fig : schemec ] is a schematic illustration of the possible effect of the suppression of star formation in low - mass halos .",
    "the solid curve is the mass function of halos at @xmath12 @xcite , and we have converted the mass scale on the top axis into a star - formation rate on the bottom axis using a simple prescription ( see section  [ sec : halo ] ) . in this simple model , the lyman  @xmath0  line luminosity function ,",
    "if interpreted as directly proportional to that of the sfr , would have the shape of the solid curve .",
    "we have introduced the suppression of star formation in low mass halos by using the prescription of @xcite to efficiently filter out gas from halos below a critical mass scale @xmath67 , the filtering mass @xcite .",
    "each of the broken curves is the shape of the lyman  @xmath0  line luminosity function we expect ( again assuming it scales with sfr ) after applying filtering on a different mass scale .",
    "ultimately the filtering mass , and thus the physics described in the previous paragraph , may be constrained directly by a measurement of the shape of the star - formation rate function , along with estimates of the corresponding halo masses ( see section  [ sec : halo ] ) .",
    "only recently have deep observations with large telescopes even detected @xmath51 lyman  @xmath0  emitting galaxies ; the detailed form of the luminosity function will not be well - constrained in the immediate future",
    ". however , our low - luminosity lyman  @xmath0  survey , and others like it , in concert with surveys at higher luminosities , may constrain or detect the break in the luminosity function associated with the characteristic halo mass and where star formation is suppressed .",
    "the goal of our survey is to extend the census of lyman  @xmath0  sources at @xmath68 to the faintest luminosities possible with existing observational facilities .",
    "we achieved this through deep spectroscopic exposures on areas of sky strongly magnified by gravitational lensing .",
    "strong gravitational lensing by rich clusters of galaxies at @xmath69 is an invaluable resource to a survey covering a very small area of sky to great depth , as such clusters magnify background high - redshift sources by greater than a factor of 10 over regions of roughly @xmath70 in the image plane .",
    "this advantage comes at a price : lensing increases the apparent area of a background source at fixed surface brightness , so that the pointing is deeper by a factor of the magnification , @xmath71 , but covers only @xmath72 of the area of an equivalent unlensed pointing ( assuming unresolved sources ) .",
    "this is a superior strategy for a deep , narrow survey .",
    "achieving the same depth and area in an unlensed survey would require a factor of @xmath71 more observing time , a huge difference for @xmath73 .",
    "only a small area of the whole sky , @xmath74 , is magnified by a factor of 10 or more by clusters ; this sets a fundamental limit to the areal coverage of any survey utilizing strong lensing by clusters . for a large survey that detected many sources , statistical information about the distribution of magnification over the survey area might be sufficient to construct a lyman  @xmath0  emitter luminosity function .",
    "however , since we planned to survey a small area and detect only a few sources , we chose to observe clusters with _",
    "hst _ imaging and spectroscopic redshifts for many of the identified arcs and multiple images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these are currently available for only a small fraction of strong - lensing clusters .",
    "the positions and spectroscopic redshifts of the arcs constrain the distribution of mass in the cluster which can , in turn , be used to predict a magnification map of the cluster for high - redshift sources . since lensing depends on the angular - diameter distance between the source and the lens , and",
    "that distance changes slowly with redshift at @xmath53 , the sky area with large magnification is fairly independent of the source redshift for @xmath75    given that high - quality lens models are only available for about a dozen clusters observable from hawaii , the total area available to us for a survey is currently quite small .",
    "to make the most of this limited resource , we conducted a spectroscopic survey .",
    "the advantage of a spectroscopic survey is that lyman  @xmath0  emission can be simultaneously surveyed for over a redshift range 2.2@xmath16.7 .",
    "the primary draw - back of a spectroscopic survey was that , with the instrumentation available , the most efficient technique was slit spectroscopy .",
    "the geometry of a long slit is not well matched to the lensed region of sky ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : johan ] ) , thus some of the slit area covers area outside the cluster that is not strongly magnified .",
    "a long - slit survey does have other advantages .",
    "we can expect many emission - line sources in our survey other than lyman  @xmath0 ; in particular , optical lines associated with strong star formation , such as [ ] 3726 , 3729   ; h@xmath76 4861   ; [ ] 4959 , 5007   ; and h@xmath0 6563   .",
    "low - resolution spectroscopy with large wavelength coverage allows the rejection of many potential low - redshift contaminants through the identification of other emission lines .",
    "however , the [ ] doublet can be difficult to resolve at low dispersion and , if redshifted to @xmath77 , there are often no other strong emission lines present in the optical spectrum .",
    "thus final identification of an emission line as lyman  @xmath0  may require follow - up spectroscopy at intermediate resolution .",
    "redshift identification is aided by two additional factors .",
    "deep optical broadband imaging , available in at least one band for well - studied clusters , can be used , as in narrow - band searches , as a rejection filter : if a putative lyman  @xmath0  system shows much observable flux shortward of lyman  @xmath0 , then it is not likely a correct line identification , because the intrinsic uv spectrum combined with igm absorption create a strong decrement across the lyman  @xmath0  emission line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the second tool is available when two or more images ( due to strong lensing ) of the same high - redshift source are discovered . in this case",
    "the lensing model itself may place a reasonably strong constraint on the redshift of the system based on the observed image positions and flux ratios @xcite .",
    "the deepest survey for a given observing time would be to devote all of the time to a single slit position .",
    "however , we expect lyman  @xmath0sources to be clustered , resulting in a non - poisson distribution . to estimate an accurate luminosity function we surveyed several independent volumes ( via surveying behind several lensing clusters ) to ameliorate cosmic variance and recover the poisson noise limit ( see section  [ sec : halo ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : clusters ] summarizes the 9 lensing clusters of our survey .",
    "we have constructed a detailed mass model for each , based on _ hst _ imaging and lensed arc redshifts .",
    "details of our spectroscopic observations are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "clusters that were observed at multiple position angles are designated further by an identification number .",
    "we used the double - beam low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in long - slit mode on the keck i 10-meter telescope at mauna kea to perform our survey .",
    "for the 2000 march observations we used a slit 0.7  wide and a spectroscopic range of @xmath78  68009500    ( corresponding to lyman  @xmath0  with 4.6@xmath16.8 ) , using a 600-line grating blazed at @xmath797500  which gave a resolution of @xmath803.0   . in 2001",
    "april we switched to a 1.0-wide slit and used a 600-line grating blazed at 1  @xmath81 m over the same wavelength range as above , at a resolution of @xmath804.0   . starting in 2001",
    "april we also began using a 300 line grism blazed at 5000    and a dichroic at 6800    to simultaneously take spectra on the blue arm of the spectrograph , over @xmath78 40006700    ( corresponding to lyman  @xmath0  from 2.2@xmath14.5 ) at 3.54    resolution .",
    "the length of the spectrographic slit was 175 .",
    "we mapped an area on the sky via offsetting the telescope perpendicular to the long axis of the slit by a distance equal to the slit width . at each slit position we made two exposures of 1000  sec to facilitate cosmic ray rejection .",
    "each map comprised 510 adjacent slit positions at the same position angle , giving contiguous survey areas on the sky of 8751750  arcsec@xmath82 .",
    "the pointing of the slit on the sky was verified by registration of images from the lris slit - viewing guide camera to the _ hst _ images of the cluster ( because the clusters are rich in bright galaxies , there were always many sources in the slit - viewing guide camera images ) .",
    "our sequence of slit offsets typically agreed with a regular spacing of the slit width to a precision of 0.1  ( 10% of the 1  slit ) .",
    "more importantly , registration of the slit position on the _ hst _ image enabled us to look for a broadband counterpart at the location of emission lines detected in our spectra .    the areas mapped by the procedure above were chosen to take advantage of the strong magnification of background sources provided by the foreground cluster .",
    "the magnification map of the sky around the cluster is constrained by the distribution of visible light in the cluster and the measured velocity dispersion of some cluster members , but is crucially verified and refined by including information from the locations and redshifts of strongly lensed sources .",
    "these background galaxies , generally brighter and at lower redshift than the @xmath83 sources we searched for , have been the target of previous observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we used up - to - date cluster mass models to generate redshift - dependent maps of the magnification toward @xmath84 sources using the ` lenstool ` software developed by @xcite .",
    "the angular diameter distance between the cluster and those redshifts depends only weakly on redshift , so we were able to choose areas on the sky with high magnification over our entire redshift range of interest .",
    "the geometry of the magnification map is generally characterized by two concentric ring - like curves of formally infinite magnification , called the inner and outer critical lines .",
    "these are related to the location in the image plane of the caustic of an elliptical potential @xcite , but modified by the deviations of the projected lensing potential from an ellipse .",
    "the areas of highest magnification are found next to the critical curves , so our survey maps generally follow the outer critical line .",
    "the outer critical line is more amenable to long - slit mapping because of its greater length on the sky and its less curved form .",
    "however , in one case ( abell 1689 ) we mapped sky near the inner critical line as well .",
    "lensed sources close to the critical line are often multiply imaged , forming a merging pair on either side of the critical line .",
    "we considered this when we chose our map locations , but the irregular shape of the critical line , compared to the straight shape of our slit , limited the extent to which we could map exclusively one side of the critical line .",
    "figure  [ fig : johan ] summarizes the adopted strategy for each cluster in the context of the location of the critical line for a lensed source at @xmath12 ( dotted lines ) . in the most massive clusters with the best mass models , such as abell  1689 and abell  2218 , we made multiple maps ( see also table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "in these cases each survey region is labeled by a number corresponding to the observations listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the total area on the sky covered by our survey was 4.2  arcmin@xmath85 . the effective areal coverage of the survey is smaller due to lensing by a spatially variable magnification factor ( see section  [ sec : mag ] ) .",
    "the 2-d spectroscopic data were reduced using standard techniques in the noao / iraf software environment .",
    "cosmic rays were rejected from each pair of images at a given location with the ` l.a.cosmic ` routine @xcite and sky emission was removed by subtracting block - filtered data .",
    "sky subtraction was not photon - limited on the strong night sky lines due to the presence of fringing features ; we account for this when determining our sensitivity in section  [ sec : suranal ] .",
    "we calibrated our absolute efficiency with observations of spectrophotometric stars @xcite .",
    "the sky - subtracted 2-d spectral images were independently inspected by two of the authors ( rse and jr ) and a catalog of 46 candidate lyman  @xmath0emission lines was compiled .",

    "candidate lyman  @xmath0  emission lines were characterized on the basis of several criteria .",

    "thus a 5-@xmath121 limit should be appropriate for the calculation of our survey volume .",
    "the limiting line flux varies as a function of wavelength due to the wavelength dependence of the atmospheric absorption and the sensitivities of the telescope and instrument , but the largest dependence is due to the strong variation in atmospheric emission from oh airglow lines ( except at @xmath123   , where the sharp drop in instrumental sensitivity dominates ) .",

    "we then converted baryons within those dark matter halos into stars , and stellar ionizing light into lyman  @xmath0  photons . unlike @xcite we made no attempt to model the radiative transfer of the lyman  @xmath0  photons .",
    "specifically , we assumed that 10% of the baryons in each halo were converted into stars every halo dynamical time ( defined as the ratio of the halo virial radius to the halo circular velocity at the virial radius ) .",
    "the hubble time at @xmath12 is roughly 10 times longer than the halo dynamical time , thus it is possible for such halos to maintain steady star formation at this rate .",
    "star - formation rate was converted into an ionizing - photon rate using a salpeter imf with 1/20 solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "we assumed that 10% of the ionizing photons escape the emitting galaxy , and that 2/3 of the remaining photons are converted into lyman  @xmath0  emission .",
    "the luminosity function predicted by this simple model provides a poor fit to our data . in the context of the model",
    ", it is instructive to think of two modifications that would make the predicted luminosity function more closely match our data .",
    "the first is to decrease the efficiency factors used to convert halo mass to lyman  @xmath0  luminosity in a given halo .",
    "alternately , the model curve could be brought into agreement with our data if the efficiency factor for the production of lyman  @xmath0  was correct for a fraction of halos , but the rest had no observable lyman  @xmath0  emission at the time of observation .",
    "there are three efficiencies that contribute to the overall conversion of halo mass into lyman  @xmath0  luminosity , namely the fraction of baryons converted into stars per halo dynamical time , the stellar emissivity of ionizing photons , and the fraction of ionizing photons observed as lyman  @xmath0  emission . lowering the combined efficiency by 1.52 orders of magnitude would bring the model luminosity function into close agreement with our data .",
    "there is some difference in the shape of the curve compared to our data , but this difference is not significant .    in the case where only a fraction of halos contain lyman  @xmath0  emitters ,",
    "we would require about 1% of halos to contain emitters at any given time .",
    "this could be because , in contrast to the simple model we described , star formation is episodic in nature .",
    "in addition , there could be a timescale associated with the escape of lyman  @xmath0  photons , such that , for example , dust extinguishes lyman  @xmath0  emission at the beginning of a starburst , but eventually the dust is expelled and the lyman  @xmath0emission line becomes visible ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if only some halos contain galaxies , for whatever reason , then this formalism of assuming only a fraction of halos contain lyman  @xmath0  emitters can also be used , where the fraction now represents a filling factor , rather than a duty cycle .",
    "the resolution of the discrepancy between our data and the model curve has important implications for the mass of the halos that contain the lyman  @xmath0  emitters . if we over - estimated the lyman  @xmath0  photon production efficiency in our model , then the association between halo mass and lyman  @xmath0  emitter expressed in figs .",
    "[ fig : tmplfmf ] and [ fig : newtmplfmf ] is not correct : the halo mass of our population of emitters at @xmath152 should be @xmath153 .",
    "this is the largest mass that could be inferred for this population , assuming a maximum of one lyman  @xmath0  emitter per halo . from the arguments of section  [ sec : lowlum ]",
    ", we may expect that halos with masses @xmath154 to form stars roughly similarly to one another , i.e. , though negative feedback may be important in regulating star formation , it is ineffective in halos this massive .",
    "consequently , for this low - efficiency , high halo - mass solution to the discrepancy , we expect that our data should follow the shape of the dark - matter halo mass function , which they do .",
    "in contrast , if we resolve the discrepancy between the model and our data by assuming that the efficiency we calculated is correct for a fraction of halos , and the rest are empty of lyman  @xmath0  emission , then the mass association in figs .  [",

    "this implies a halo mass of only @xmath155 for our lyman  @xmath0  emitters at @xmath152 .",
    "depending on the characteristic mass scale where negative feedback becomes a dominant process , the lyman  @xmath0  luminosity function may already deviate from the shape of the mass function at @xmath155 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schemec ] ) .",
    "our data are slightly flatter than the mass function , and consistent with any of the luminosity functions plotted in fig .",

    "the heterogeneous nature of the lyman  @xmath0  survey data plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : tmplfmf ] and [ fig : newtmplfmf ] makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions , but a combination of data at @xmath156 suggests that our data point at @xmath141 may be 0.51 dex lower than an extrapolation of the lyman  @xmath0  luminosity function from higher luminosity , assuming the luminosity function shape matches the mass function shape .",
    "thus we conclude that our data , in combination with other lyman  @xmath0  surveys , suggest that strong negative feedback is suppressing the star - formation rate , and thus lyman  @xmath0  luminosity , in our sources .",

    "this implies , contrary to our assumption above , that there is more than one lyman  @xmath0source per halo .",
    "the virial radius of a @xmath12 , @xmath55 halo is 8.5 , so multiple sources inside a single halo may be observed as separate sources , though this should create a very distinct signature in the spatial distribution of sources ( or extended nature , if the sources are unresolved ) that has not been reported by other lyman  @xmath0  emitter surveys .",
    "while current information on the masses of lyman  @xmath0  emitter halos is still limited , progress will continue to be made at @xmath156 by large lyman  @xmath0  surveys .",
    "unfortunately , surveys for low - luminosity lyman  @xmath0  emitters will not provide sufficient survey area for clustering studies in the near future .",
    "lensed surveys such as ours , in particular , do not lend themselves to easy clustering analysis , because the contiguous survey volume is very complex and limited in size by the mass of the lensing foreground cluster . as an aside",

    "until the advent of large - area , low - luminosity lyman  @xmath0  surveys , the only constraint on the mass of the halos containing the emitters , and thus the only path toward understanding the suppression of star - formation in low - mass halos , lies in detecting source populations with high number densities , such that the halo mass function , and the assumption that there is at most one source per halo , can be used to infer a maximum halo mass for the population of lyman  @xmath0  emitters .",
    "this is strong motivation for future surveys to continue to use strong lensing to survey small volumes to considerable depths for faint , lyman  @xmath0emitting sources .",
    "we performed a systematic survey for lyman  @xmath0  emission at @xmath18 using strong lensing from intermediate - redshift clusters of galaxies to boost our survey sensitivity to unprecedented depths .",

    "our survey covered 4.2  arcmin@xmath82 on the sky , with a maximum volume of @xmath161 over @xmath145 .",
    "we find no evidence for redshift evolution of the number density of lyman  @xmath0  emitting galaxies between @xmath51 and @xmath10 , though our data are also consistent with a decrease in number density with increasing redshift .",
    "we present the first meaningful constraints on the the luminosity function of lyman  @xmath0  emitters at @xmath133 over the lyman  @xmath0  luminosity range @xmath162 , corresponding to inferred star - formation rates of 0.011@xmath163 . from a consideration of the number density of dark - matter halos ,",
    "we conclude that our population of sources at @xmath164 resides in halos of mass @xmath165 .",
    "our number density data are consistent with a lyman  @xmath0  luminosity function with the same shape as the halo mass function , but a consideration of all available lyman  @xmath0  survey data implies that we have observed a flattening of the lyman  @xmath0  luminosity function with respect to the halo mass function . we may have detected evidence of the suppression of star - formation in low - mass halos at high redshift , as predicted by theoretical models of galaxy formation .",
