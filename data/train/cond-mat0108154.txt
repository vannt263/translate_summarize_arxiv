    "much attention has been focused on the vortex pinning in type - ii superconductors .",
    "the vortex pinning in the superconductors under magnetic fields plays an important role on various vortex - related quantities and phenomena such as the critical current , hysteresis of the magnetization , and quantum vortex tunneling .",
    "the problem of the vortex pinning is categorized in two aspects .",
    "one is the elementary vortex pinning force , which is the interaction between a vortex and a single defect .",
    "the other is the summation problem , which is how the elementary vortex pinning forces add up to a holding force on the elastic vortex lattice under a distribution of defects @xcite .",
    "a study of the elementary vortex pinning is the step necessary for the understanding of the phenomena related to the vortex pinning in the superconductors under magnetic fields .",
    "traditionally , the mechanism of the elementary vortex pinning is considered to be that a defect locally prohibits superconducting condensation so that it attracts a normal region of a vortex core in order to avoid the loss of the condensation energy .",
    "@xcite advanced the understanding of the mechanism of the elementary vortex pinning , taking account of a nonlocal effect that a defect as a scattering center scatters the quasiparticles .",
    "this mechanism of the vortex pinning is that the quasiparticle scattering by the defect inside a vortex core helps to avoid suppressions of the order parameter around the vortex center up to distances of the order of the coherence length . in this paper",

    "the unconventional superconductivity is recently proposed for many superconductors such as high-@xmath3 cuprates , organic conductors , and heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "for example , the @xmath0-wave superconductivity is believed to be realized in most of the high-@xmath3 cuprates , and the chiral @xmath2-wave one is expected in a non - copper - layered perovskite superconductor sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 @xcite ( although it seems to be open to further discussion @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate numerically the elementary vortex pinning potential for @xmath0- , anisotropic @xmath1- , and isotropic @xmath1-wave pairings , and compare them each other to clarify what could be one of the characteristic properties specific to the superconductors with the unconventional order parameter .",
    "we also present an analytical consideration of a novel chirality - dependent vortex pinning in a chiral @xmath2-wave superconductor .",
    "to investigate the vortex pinning , we use the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
