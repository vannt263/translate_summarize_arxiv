    "the hipparcos proper motion measurements ( @xcite ) of neighbouring stars radically enlarge the size and quality of kinematical unbiased samples and provide a new opportunity to reconsider the local galactic structure and solar neighbourhood kinematics . visualization and analysis of the local velocity field from the hipparcos tangential velocities ( chereul et al , @xcite , @xcite ) or combined with radial velocities ( figueras et al , @xcite ) show the large structuring of phase space and reveal the process of phase mixing with time .",
    "clearly a much better understanding of the local kinematics and of the galactic dynamics will be obtained while the real complexity of the local kinematics is now apparent .    in this paper , we re - examine the classical kinematic analysis .",
    "we focuss this study on the two following points : 1 ) it is necessary to build a dynamically coherent model of the kinematics since an analysis based on the jeans equations is not sufficient and a more rigorous approach follows from using solutions of the boltzmann equation ; 2 ) we measure the galactic gradients ( stellar density and kinematics , slope of velocity curve ) from the local kinematic data and constrain the potential shape and the radial forces close to the plane .",
    "we deduce the flattening of the galactic potential ( and mass distribution ) in the galaxy .",
    "this is a complementary approach to the more classical @xmath10 problem , i.e. the analysis of the force perpendicular to the galactic plane ( crz et al , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we analyse the hipparcos proper motions , first using only a schwarzschild decomposition (  2 ) then with the help of a 3d dynamical galactic model (  3 ) which is a generalization of shu s model .",
    "conclusions regarding the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , density and kinematic gradients are drawn (  4 ) .",
    "we finally present a first observational constraint on the radial potential bending at the solar position (  5 ) .",
    "the hipparcos data allow us to build a kinematic sample free from kinematic bias , that is the properties used to define the sample are not a kinematic parameter or do not explicitly depend on velocities .",
    "survey stars , labeled s on column h68 in hip catalogue ( @xcite ) , satisfy this criteria .",
    "they define a magnitude limited sample from hic ( @xcite ) magnitudes with dependence on galactic latitude , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 for spectral types earlier or equal to @xmath13 and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "a first sample has been defined with survey stars by removing spectroscopic binaries ( flag h59 set ) and potential binaries in the hipparcos solution ( flag h61 set to s ) and keeping stars with relative errors on parallaxes smaller than 10% to avoid kinematics containing erroneous or additional motions . the resulting sample ( 11766 stars )",
    "has been divided into 19 sets corresponding to successive ranges of @xmath15 colour for main sequence stars , and a twentieth set for giants in order to examine the kinematic variations between the subsets .",
    "we have used the proper motions and parallaxes giving the tangential velocities to probe the local kinematics .",
    "correction for galactic rotation has been applied using feast & whitelock s ( @xcite ) values as done by binney et al ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also analysed a second sample in order to use the three components of velocity , adding radial velocity measurements to the tangential velocities , and expecting to obtain a stronger constraint on the galactic structure .",
    "however , it is known that radial velocities have been measured preferentially for high proper motion stars ( see figure 2 from binney et al , @xcite ) and , as a consequence , without careful selection or analysis , such data may introduce kinematic bias . that reason alone justifies the necessity to analyse firstly the hipparcos proper motions without radial velocities .    in order to analyze the full three kinematic components , @xmath16 , we have used stars from the mccormick survey ( vyssotsky , @xcite ) .",
    "this sample ( 895 stars ) is based on spectroscopic surveys of identification of m dwarfs and must be without kinematic bias ( weiss & upgren , @xcite ) .",
    "radial velocities are obtained from the literature ; most data were found in the following catalogues : hic ( @xcite ) , and more recently in kamper et al ( @xcite ) , reid et al ( @xcite ) , upgren & harlow ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simbad data base has allowed for a systematic search and cross - identifications . keeping only data for which velocity accuracy is better than @xmath17 and rejecting identified spectroscopic binaries and variables , we obtain a sample of 309 stars .",
    "these stars have kinematics slightly hotter than the sample of giants .",
    "they have been combined to a sample of giants and red stars from hip survey stars .      to understand the main behaviour of the distribution function @xmath18 for the various stellar samples , we refer to the analysis given by chereul et al ( @xcite , @xcite ) , gmez et al ( @xcite ) , figueras et al ( @xcite ) , binney et al ( @xcite ) , dehnen ( @xcite ) , giving both the axis ratio of velocity distributions and descriptions of clumps in phase space and irregularities .",
    "we have proceeded to a schwarzschild distribution fitting ( more exactly to a 3d gaussian fitting with one of the principal axes fixed to z axis ) to the hipparcos proper motions and ( @xmath19 ) coordinates distribution dispersions . ] .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2]-[fig3 ] give results for each colour bin .",
    "u is the velocity towards the galactic center , v towards the galactic rotation and w towards the north galactic pole .",
    "fitting with two ellipsoids does not improve the determination , the second fitted ellipsoid adjusting one of the moving group .",
    "we find the solar velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) to be @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 component is usually taken as the limit @xmath23 in the asymmetric drift relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "however the slope is not constant and the limit may range between 4 and @xmath24 depending heavily on the range of @xmath25 variances selected . the fact that the asymmetric drift relation is not linear can not be related to the @xmath26 variation that is too small .",
    "the simplest explanations should be that the density or the kinematic scale lengths change gradually with populations or that the bluest populations are not kinematically relaxed .",
    "such features are also marginally visible in fig .  1 given by mayor ( @xcite ) .",
    "the vertex deviation is maximum for blue stars ( @xmath27 ) and for the reddest stars it fluctuates around @xmath28 .",
    "since red stars are a mixture of old and young stars with a large vertex deviation , it is compatible with a null vertex deviation for the old stars .",
    "accurate ages help in answering this question and show a null deviation ( gmez et al , @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid axis ratio @xmath26 varies rapidly with colour bins , increasing from 0.45 for blue stars to 0.55 to red ones , similar to the feature obtained by gmez et al ( @xcite ) by splitting stars by age intervals .",

    "stars with extreme velocities larger than 3 times the mean dispersions have been rejected ( 11685 stars remaining ) .",
    "this allows for the removal of possible halo stars or objects that could not be described by our disc star modeling .",
    "all models are fitted to data by adjusting the model parameters by a maximum likelihood .",
    "this means that the fitting procedure gives unbiased estimates of the model parameters ( and is asymptotically convergent ) _ if _ the observations are drawn from a parent distribution corresponding to the assumed model .",
    "errors are obtained from the second derivatives of the likelihood at the position of maximum .",
    "the inverse of this matrix is the covariance matrix of the derived parameters giving errors and correlations .",
    "the estimated errors have also been checked by repeating fits to random subsamples .",
    "thus errors on parameter estimates are dominated by the data sampling",
    ". a much smaller source of errors comes from the accuracy of proper motions and distances measured by hipparcos .",
    "a crude estimate of such errors is obtained by considering the median error on tangential velocities ( from proper motions , parallaxes and their respective errors within our sample ) and we find @xmath38 for one velocity component . with a sample of 11600 stars ,",
    "the resulting error , for instance , on each solar velocity component is only @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "systematic effects , such as correlations between the hipparcos solutions for close stars , exist while at large scale they must be null at the exception of the error related to the link to an inertial reference system .",
    "the deviation from inertial , non - rotating within @xmath40 ( kovalevsky et al , @xcite ) , has negligible effects on the estimate of moments .",
    "systematic errors or bias due to the inadequacy of the model are naturally the most difficult to evaluate . only a more general model would help to quantify that question .",
    "for instance the non - zero vertex deviation is not considered by eq .  1 the axisymmetric model ( a non - axisymmetric model with three integrals could have been considered , but in the case of a stckel potential",
    ", the vertex deviation would have been the same for all stellar groups ) .",
    "certainly the vertex deviation introduces a bias on the estimate of velocity moments if the moments are estimated assuming a null - deviation .",
    "this will result in a bias on the other estimated parameters , scale length , slope of the rotation curve and is discussed further .",
    "a non - parametric approach could seem more attractive , avoiding the bias of parametric models and allowing for a possibly unbiased determination of the various velocity moments .",
    "however , in this paper , we want to avoid a direct determination of the velocity moments and then the use of relations drawn from jeans equations since we have shown that such equations lead to bias ( see  3.2 and bienaym & schaud @xcite , see also kuijken & tremaine , @xcite ) and that a more rigorous approach is acheived using solutions of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the following analysis is based on a parametric model for an axisymmetric thin rotating stellar disk .",
    "such model was firstly introduced by shu ( @xcite ) and extended in bienaym & schaud ( @xcite ) adding independent gradients for the density and the kinematics ( see also kuijken & dubinski , @xcite ) .",
    "this model is a parametric distribution function having a two - integral of motion dependence , the energy @xmath41 and the angular momentum @xmath42 .",
    "the fundamental parameters are closely linked to the radial density gradients of the disc stellar populations and also to their kinematic gradients and to the shape of the circular velocity curve .",
    "it has been applied to the analysis of the cns3 ( gliese & jahreiss @xcite ) in order to explain the observed local velocity distribution ( bienaym & schaud , @xcite ) .",
    "the main improvement of this model compared to shu s model is its ability to reproduce the observed marginal velocity distribution of stars .",
    "this is due to the introduction of three realistic independent parameters , the density , kinematic dispersion and rotation curve gradients ( see also previous investigations of the local kinematics with dynamically coherent distribution functions by kuijken & tremaine , @xcite , evans & collett , @xcite and cuddeford & binney @xcite ) .    based on an application of the jeans equation , fux & martinet ( @xcite ) deduced from the observed moments ( asymmetric drift and velocity dispersions ) that the density scale length is close to @xmath43 with assumptions on the closure of the hierarchy of velocity moment equations ( cuddeford & amendt , @xcite ) .",
    "we must however notice that such analysis using first and second order moments of the distribution neglects available informations like the velocity distribution kurtosis and skewness .",
    "the galactic potential can be fitted by a stckel potential in the solar neighbourhood . there",
    "the effective potential can be expanded in powers of ( r-@xmath44 ) and z. how well can this expansion be matched by a similar one for a separable potential ?",
    "for instance , a first order development gives a @xmath45 and @xmath46 separable potential which is then used for the estimate of the force perpendicular to the plane and for the mass density determination in the plane .",
    "van de hulst ( @xcite ) and kent & de zeeuw ( @xcite ) solved the expansion problem with stckel potentials .",
    "the expansion includes the third order term @xmath47 related to the potential flattening .",
    "if the galactic potential were of stckel form we would have an exact measure of its flattening ( through the parameter @xmath48 , the focus of the ellipsoidal coordinate system defined in the appendix ) .",
    "the galactic potential is certainly not exactly of a stckel form , but probably not so far from it as long as like here , we consider stars within a small range of excursion from the solar position ( @xmath49 radially and @xmath50 vertically ) . a more general analysis",
    "( using orbit computations for instance ) could establish accurately the coupling between the vertical and radial motions and its link to any potential .",
    "the advantage of stckel potentials is their tractability and they are certainly sufficient for a first analysis . in this paper it allows us to establish formally the importance of the potential flattening on the stellar motions in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the model is a 3d extension of the 2d distribution function described in bienaym & schaud ( @xcite ) .",

    "we have computed the asymmetric drift relation for stationary solutions given by our model and the results are plotted ( fig .",

    "hipparcos data as well as other data used to study the asymmetric drift fall in this range of velocity drift . however , as seen in  2.1 , the asymmetric drift relation is not strictly linear . finally for stellar populations having larger drifts , like the thick disc , the use of a linear relation is certainly wrong .",
    "the asymmetric drift is neither entirely described by the moment equation 4.34 of binney & tremaine ( @xcite ) nor by the more exact relations such these plotted on fig .",

    "since the determination ( @xmath193 ) is not yet very accurate , we have not developed detailed galactic mass models ( uncertainties on @xmath171 and @xmath170 could lead at most to @xmath194 corresponding to a more spherical potential ) .",

    "is compensated by decreasing the mass density scale length in the disc in order to keep @xmath168 to the observed value .",
    "however the dark matter halo can not be flattened by more than a factor of 4 or 6 , otherwise the local halo density is not much smaller than the disc mass density and then @xmath168 converges quickly towards 0.5 .",

    "we conclude that an extremely flat dark halo is rejected at @xmath142 and models favour a spherical halo or halos with a local scale height larger than @xmath205 at the solar galactic radius .",
    "there is a need for more data to bring a stronger constraint and to determine more precisely the galactic potential .",

    "we may reject with certainty some galactic mass distributions : those corresponding to ( unexpected ) oblate stckel potentials with a focus beyond the solar galactic radius and an ellipsoid tilt pointing in the galactic plane outwards .",
    "models with @xmath206 are also rejected : they could correspond to cylindrical potential produced by a vertical and extremely prolate dark matter halo with a nearly constant mass density up to height of about @xmath207 . such a halo would rotate about its major axis in order to have an angular momentum parallel to the stellar disk one .",
    "this is a confirmation of collisionless simulations of the dark halo that do not produce such halo configurations : `` there is decided lack of halos which rotate about the major axis although this is a stable configuration '' ( warren et al , @xcite ) .",
    "we analyse the kinematics of nearby stars from the hipparcos proper motions and determine the solar motion and the kinematic and density gradients of the observed stellar populations . for that purpose ,",
