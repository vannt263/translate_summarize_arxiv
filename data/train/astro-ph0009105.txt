    "since their discovery by schmidt in the early 60 s , quasars have been an intriguing phenomenon and the mystery surrounding them is still far from being resolved .",
    "soon after being identified as galactic nuclei , accretion onto a supermassive black hole became the leading model for powering these objects ( lynden bell , 1969 ) , whose luminosities can far exceed those of galaxies , but whose space density is around two orders of magnitude lower than that of bright galaxies .",
    "the question of whether quasar activity was a short - lived phenomenon that occurred repeatedly during a galaxy s lifetime ( cavaliere & padovani , 1989 ; siemiginowska & elvis , 1997 ) , or whether quasars never `` wake up '' again after a single , longer - term , activity cycle ( haiman & loeb , 1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees , 1998 ) , leaving behind massive black hole remnants , has not yet been resolved .",
    "the quasar population clearly evolves with cosmic time .",
    "the quasar space density above a given luminosity increases by a factor of @xmath4 50 from the present to @xmath6 , then stalls and probably decreases to @xmath7 ( hook , shaver & mcmahon , 1998 ) . for many years",
    "the observed quasar evolution has been addressed phenomenologically , mostly via pure luminosity evolution ( ple - mathez , 1976 ) or pure density evolution ( pde - schmidt , 1968 ) .",
    "both descriptions have just one free adjustable parameter , but are physically rather abstract . moreover pde and ple are observationally indistinguishable when only a power law is observed , as is common",
    ". instead physically based models may be constrained by a simple power law , since neither the slope nor the normalization is now arbitrary . an early attempt to explain the observed quasar space density using a physics - based model",
    "was made by efstathiou and rees ( 1988 ) , who used the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter , 1974 ) for dark matter halo formation in order to predict the space density of the more luminous quasars .",
    "this work has been followed by several such attempts , with results that do not always agree ( cavaliere & padovani , 1988 ; haehnelt & rees , 1993 ; yi , 1996 ; siemiginowska & elvis , 1997 ; haiman & menou , 2000 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees , 1998 ; salucci et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "cavaliere & vittorini ( 1998 ) suggest that the steep rise of the number density of quasars from early epochs to a redshift of @xmath42.5 is due to the newly formed galactic halos ( density evolution ) while their fall at lower redshifts is due to merging processes ( luminosity evolution ) , creating a link between the phenomenological models and the more robust theory .",
    "quasars are now a common ingredient of n - body simulations , semi - analytical or analytical models , which follow step by step the formation and evolution of galaxies within dark matter halos and the merging processes ( e.g. richstone et al . , 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt , 2000 ; monaco at al . , 2000 ) .",
    "all of the above suggests that galaxy and quasar , both formation and evolution are closely related , not least because there is so far no evidence of quasar activity outside galaxies .",
    "previous work derives the black hole mass distribution from cold dark matter ( cdm ) models ( haehnelt & rees , 1993 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees , 1998 ) or from observations of the local non - active galaxies ( salucci et al . , 1999 ) , but then considers an essentially arbitrary exponential quasar light curve : a short active phase with luminosities close to the eddington limit at the beginning of the black hole s life , followed by a rapid exponential decay , due to fuel exhaustion caused by the high accretion rates needed .",
    "such a quasar light curve is only an approximation of the accretion process and does not include the physics of the accretion disk which is thought to be formed during accretion onto a supermassive black hole in quasars ( e.g. lynden - bell 1969 , shields 1978 , rees 1984 ) .",
    "accretion disks have been studied in detail in many types of binary systems , where they usually show complex variability .",
    "both observations and theory point to strong similarities in the behavior of accretion disks around galactic black hole x - ray sources and of those around quasars ( tanaka & lewin , 1995 ; fiore & elvis , 1997 ; czerny , schwarzenberg - czerny & loska , 1999 ) .",
    "these similarities suggest quite a different quasar light curve .",
    "large amplitude instabilities typically appear in accretion disks , leading to repetitive outbursts as large as a factor of @xmath8 on the timescale of thousand to million years depending on the disk model ( siemiginowska , czerny and kostyunin , 1996 , lin & shields 1986 ) . in the case of quasar black holes , these variations alone",
    "inevitably create a broad luminosity function ( siemiginowska & elvis , 1997 ) .",
    "unstable accretion leading to episodic outbursts has a valuable feature . in our previous paper ( siemiginowska & elvis , 1997 ) quasar light curves were derived by assuming a continuous fuel supply at a low constant accretion rate of @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the critical accretion rate corresponding to the eddington luminosity for a given mass ) . at this rate",
    "a @xmath11 black hole accretes some @xmath12/yr while a @xmath13 black hole accretes 1@xmath14/yr , so a black hole would need @xmath15 years to change its mass by an order of magnitude .",
    "consequently the problem of creating hypermassive ( 10@xmath16 soltan 1982 , phinney 1983 ) quasar remnants does not occur , if the highest initial black hole mass is 10@xmath17 .",
    "in this paper we build on the siemiginowska & elvis ( 1997 ) work by combining the cdm derived black hole mass spectrum with the luminosity function for a particular mass derived from the time - dependent accretion disk theory .",
    "this results in an end - to - end model for quasar evolution that is completely physics based , excepting only the ratio of black hole mass to dark matter halo mass . since this model links cdm and quasar evolution ,",
    "the parameters of cdm constrain quasar evolution , and the observed quasar evolution constrains cdm parameters .",
    "we examine some of the implications of this model .",
    "we assume that each quasar hosts a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "the disk is the main emission component and driver of the quasar activity .",
    "we calculate a quasar light curve assuming that quasar emission is due to a non - stationary accretion disk , thus the quasar luminosity during evolution of accretion disk is calculated by integrating the disk emission at each epoch . our time - dependent accretion disk model ( siemiginowska et al . , 1996",
    ") takes into account thermal - viscous instabilities due to hydrogen ionization , which can develop in the disk ( smak , 1982 ; lin & shields , 1986 ) .",
    "these instabilities are observed in both cataclysmic variables and galactic black hole candidates ( smak , 1984 ; tuchman , mineshige & shields , 1990 ) , where they cause factor of 10@xmath18 luminosity outbursts .",
    "similar amplitudes are expected in the disks around supermassive black holes but the timescales are of order of hundred to hundred million years ( burderi et al 1998 , siemiginowska , czerny & kostyunin , 1996 ; mineshige & shields 1990 ) . as a consequence",
    "a single source can emit within a wide luminosity range depending on the current state of the disk .",
    "even if there is a continuous fuel supply the source will exhibit many active and quiescent states , making ` quasar activity ' a recurrent phenomenon occurring numerous times during a galaxy s lifetime .",
    "for example , for a black hole of @xmath19 , 5 outbursts occur in @xmath20 years ( figure [ lightcurve ] ) .",
    "siemiginowska & elvis ( 1997 ) derived the quasar luminosity function by integrating the time spent by a quasar in each luminosity state and assuming that this distribution is applied over a whole ( uncoordinated ) population with a range of black hole masses .",
    "we have checked a simplifying assumption in siemiginowska & elvis ( 1997 ) that the distribution of time in each state is constant for all black holes masses . in figure [ lightcurve ]",
    "we show the light curves , due to emission from the accretion disk which exhibits thermal - viscous instabilities , for black holes with masses @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath13 . the overall form of the light curves is the same , but for larger masses , outbursts are rarer than for lower masses , the high luminosity phases last much longer and the mean luminosity increases too . figure [ mvst ] quantifies this by showing how the number of outbursts per @xmath24 yr and the duration of each outburst vary with the black hole mass .",
    "both the number of outbursts and their duration depend quadratically on the black hole mass .",
    "note that at @xmath11 an outburst occurs every century , which means that in a sample of 100 agn we should be able to observe one transition per year .",
    "the piccinotti et al ( 1982 ) 2 - 10  kev selected sample has @xmath25 non - blazar agns , roughly equally divided between broad and narrow - line objects . in the @xmath25 years",
    "that these sources have been studied , one ( ngc 7582 ) has changed from purely narrow to broad - line status , followed by a considerable change in its luminosity ( aretxaga et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the expected statistics .",
    "monitoring of large ( n@xmath26 ) emission - line selected agn samples for a few years would strongly test this key premise of the model .",
    "integration of the light curves over time shows that each source spends the greater part of its lifetime ( around @xmath27 ) in a `` quiescent '' state and @xmath28 in an active state ( @xmath29 ) with @xmath4 10@xmath30 in a very active state ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "these percentages are almost identical for all black hole masses , as shown in table [ tab ] .",
    "deviations are no larger than 5@xmath30 over a range of 4 orders of magnitude , which is insignificant .",
    "the fraction of time a source spends in each activity state is essentially indeed independent of its mass , as assumed by siemiginowska & elvis ( 1997 ) .",

    "the press - schechter formalism predicts the mass fraction of the universe contained in virialized structures , resulting from a gravitational hierarchical process ( dark matter halos ) .",
    "the mass function of the dark matter halos ( dmhs ) can be written as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the comoving density .",
    "this formula gives the number of dark matter halos of mass @xmath41 formed up to a redshift @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 , the critical over - density in linear theory for spherical collapse , has been considered constant , equal to 1.69 ( e.g. sahni & coles , 1995 ) , although it depends weakly on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the linear theory rms mass density fluctuation in spheres of mass @xmath41 at redshift @xmath42 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a simplified form of the linear growth factor ( peebles , 1980 ) that represents the growth of a perturbation in the linear regime . for the calculation of @xmath48 we used the approximation of the present rms mass density fluctuation in spheres of mass @xmath41 ( e.g. fan et al . , 1997 ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mean mass in a sphere of radius 8h@xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath0 is the exponent of the power spectrum @xmath53 , and the corresponding @xmath54 . comparing to other results ( haehnelt , natarajan & rees , 1998 ) we verified that the shape of the mass function for masses greater than @xmath23 is not affected by this approximation .",

    "bahcall et al . , 1997 ; boyce et al . ,",
    "narrow lined ( type 2 ) agn can also reside in both early type galaxies and in spirals ( e.g. salucci et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "we assume that the distinction between quasars and seyferts is purely one of luminosity ( we also include both radio - loud and radio - quiet agn in term ` quasar ' ) , the latter occurring in spiral galaxies , since we consider that they are both the manifestation of the same basic phenomenon .",
    "the black hole mass function can be directly derived from the dark matter halo mass function .",
    "we assume that in each newly formed dark matter halo a black hole is `` instantly '' created , i.e. that all galaxies harbor a black hole .",
    "this hypothesis has been supported by several observations ( e.g. keel , 1983 ; ho et al . , 1997 ; magorrian et al . , 1998 ;",
    "richstone et al .",
    ", 1998 ; ford et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) assumed that black hole formation is restricted to halos whose masses are bigger than @xmath57 with the mass of the black hole being a constant fraction of the dark matter halo mass : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 = 3.2 for all black hole masses .",
    "we adopt this mass relation as a baseline , but examine the possibilities of varying @xmath59 between 4.5 and 3.2 .",
    "the resulting black hole mass functions are shown in figure [ massfunps]b .",
    "values close to 3.2 are consistent with the @xmath60 of magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while values close to 4.5 are consistent with the @xmath61 , given by wandel ( 1999 ) , where @xmath62 denotes the mass of the galactic bulge .",
    "we also consider the possibility of an @xmath59 that is a function of the dmh mass , @xmath63 , which is equivalent to a non - linear relation between the bh and dmh masses , @xmath64 .",
    "the dash - dotted line in figure [ massfunps]b traces the black hole mass function for @xmath65 , a value chosen by fitting the observations , as explained in the next section .",
    "the luminosity function is the product of the fraction of time each source of a given mass spends in each luminosity ( activity state ) and their space density ( siemiginowska & elvis , 1997 ) .",
    "more formally , the luminosity function of a population of quasars is the result of the convolution of their mass function with the light curve , l(t ) , of an individual source of each mass :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the mass function and @xmath68 is the fraction of objects that contribute to a given luminosity at a given redshift ( equivalent to @xmath69 in equation [ hmlf ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the haiman & menou ( 2000 ) suggestion that the observed quasar luminosity function @xmath70 , can be directly compared with the press - schechter dmh mass function , @xmath71 , to derive the luminosity of each halo of mass @xmath41 :    @xmath72    where @xmath69 is the quasar `` duty cycle '' defined as the fraction of black holes that are active at a given redshift , @xmath42 .",
    "note that equation [ lf ] is the integrated form of equation [ hmlf ] , if the halo mass function is replaced by the black hole mass function .    by integrating the light curves over timescales that allow many outbursts to occur , we calculated the time a source spends in the different activity states for a range of black hole masses .",
    "this is equivalent to calculating , for a certain redshift , @xmath42 , the fraction of sources of a given mass , @xmath41 , in a given activity state , @xmath73 , @xmath68 .",
    "all the above are illustrated in figure [ convol]a , where we show the contribution of sources with black hole masses from @xmath11 to @xmath13 , to the overall luminosity function , for a press - schechter derived black hole mass function at a redshift of 2 .",
    "the sources with black hole masses within the abovementioned range have luminosities within the observed limits ( 10@xmath74 ) .",
    "masses have been converted to luminosities through the light curves and @xmath59 was held constant , @xmath75 , for all black hole masses .",
    "note that in each case , a low luminosity state for a high mass source , is a high luminosity state for a lower mass source , and vice versa .",
    "figure [ convol]b shows that at each redshift , the slope defined by the high activity sources gives roughly the shape and slope of the luminosity function . in the case of an upper or lower mass limit , the luminosity function will follow the shape of the corresponding light curves , creating two breaks : one towards the lower and one towards the higher luminosities .",

    "the shape of the luminosity function and its evolution depend on these two parameters .",
    "our discussion is focussed on the effect of varying these parameters .      here",

    "for many years , the galaxy correlation function data were consistent with @xmath82 ( peebles , 1980 ; davis & peebles , 1983 ) .",
    "however , new surveys show that the shape of the power spectrum has a more complicated form and/or that the values of @xmath0 vary between small and large scales ( e.g. lin et al . , 1996 ; hermit et al . , 1996 ; le fevre et al .",
    ", 1996 ; tadros et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "we do not attempt to introduce a more complex form for the power spectrum . however",
    ", we do find that varying the exponent , @xmath0 produces strong effects on the quasar luminosity function .",
    "observations show that the quasar space density increases as @xmath83 from the current epoch up to a turnover redshift , @xmath84 , of 2 - 3 , where it stops or possibly drops ( e.g. hook et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "our models naturally produce a @xmath84 by integrating over the whole redshift range the predicted luminosity function , for sources with absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath85 .",
    "we find that the @xmath84 predicted by our models is a parabolic function of @xmath0 .",

    "figure [ zvsn]b shows the relation between @xmath84 and @xmath0 , which is roughly parabolic .",
    "moreover , this relation is almost independent of the value of @xmath59 making this a robust result , since @xmath59 is the only physically undetermined parameter in the model .",
    "the observed @xmath84 is at least as high as 2.5 ( hook et al . , 1998 ) and may be as high as @xmath4 4 ( miyaji et al . , 2000 ) , but quasar space density declines rapidly for @xmath87 , as suggested by both optical and radio observations ( kennefick et al . , 1997 ; hook et al .",
    ", 1998 ) and theoretical models ( e.g. cavaliere & vittorini , 1998 , give a @xmath84 around 3.5 ) .",
    "this puts a strong constraint on @xmath0 , which can only take the values between 1.6 and 1.8 ( figure [ zvsn]b ) .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with the values given by blanchard et al . , 1999 , derived from the galaxy clusters .",
    "we restrict the rest of our study to this range of @xmath0 .      in the next two sections",
    "we discuss how the parameter @xmath59 affects the luminosity function and we consider two possibilities : ( 1 ) @xmath59 is constant for all masses ; ( 2 ) @xmath59 is related to the mass of the dmh .",
    "most theoretical models have assumed for simplicity that the black hole mass is a constant fraction of the dark matter halo mass , independent of the masses involved ( e.g. haiman & loeb , 1998 ; haiman & menou , 2000 ) . observationally the results of magorrian et al ( 1998 ) suggest that this is roughly obeyed .",
    "therefore we first examine this possibility and compare our predictions with observations , both for low and for high redshifts .",

    "selection techniques result in biased samples and favor the redshift regions at which quasar colors make them distinguishable from stars .",
    "giallongo and vagnetti ( 1992 ) argued that the observed break was due to the uncertainties on the k - correction due to the dispersion in quasar optical slopes .",
    "this seems to be confirmed by rosat agn data ( miyaji et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "more recent surveys , which account for this effect , such as the hamburg / eso quasar survey ( which uses emission lines in addition to colors , wisotzki et al . , 1996 ,",
    "koehler et al , 1997 and wisotzki , 2000 ) show that the number of bright objects was underestimated and that the combined _ local _ luminosity function for seyferts and quasars could be fitted with a single unbroken power law , as argued by giallongo and vagnetti ( 1992 ) .",
    "pei ( 1995 ) also suggests that a single power law of the form @xmath110 could fit the data as well as a broken power law .",
    "this single power law is represented by the thin solid line in figure [ lfb ] . in terms of luminosity",
    ", galaxies with central black hole masses of the order of @xmath11 will be seen as seyfert galaxies , while the higher masses will result in quasars ( figure [ convol ] ) .    even if the observations are altered somewhat additional physical effects are likely to be important , since we derived the mass function using only the press - schechter dmh mass function .",
    "for example galaxy mergers could significantly modify the assumed mass function ( e.g. haiman & loeb , 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt , 2000 ) .",
    "mergers are rare in the early universe but start becoming important at a redshift around 2 , an epoch of massive galaxy formation ( kats et al . , 1992 ; kontorovich et al . ,",
    "only mergers that result in the formation of a single object will cause a decrease of the space density of the black holes .",
    "the black holes , due to the dynamical friction , will soon be found in the center of the newly formed object and merge ( e.g. binney & tremaine , 1994 ) , thus influencing the quasar space density .",
    "if this is the primary cause of the low @xmath42 disagreement of our model with observation then the difference of the observed to predicted evolution rates , @xmath111 , provides a crude estimate of the merger rate , @xmath112 , for redshifts between 0.5 and 2 , i.e. @xmath113 . hence the merger rate can be expressed as a function of the redshift : @xmath114 .",
    "interestingly this value is in agreement with several other results based on observations : zepf & koo ( 1989 ) studied a complete sample of 20 close pairs of faint ( b @xmath115 22 ) galaxies and found that the frequency of interacting galaxies increase as @xmath116 .",

    "( 1997 ) used a sample of 545 field galaxies and estimated that the merger rate changes with redshift as @xmath118 .",
    "note that less extreme galaxy interactions , where the objects remain independent entities afterwards will not influence our results , if we assume that whatever happens in the vicinity of an object will not influence its accretion rate and therefore its light curve . in reality , such interactions are likely to affect the accretion rate and will be taken into account in the future work .    the disagreement between the observed and the predicted luminosity function at @xmath119 may also be due to the role of obscured ( type ii ) agn .",
    "the estimates of their number density are not yet accurate .",
    "recent work ( salucci et al . , 1999 ) estimates the local mass function of the dormant black holes within elliptical galaxies , assuming that the nuclear activity is a single short event .",
    "salucci et al .",
    ", however , do not take merger effects into account , introducing uncertainties in the calculated massive dark object mass function .",
    "we used a black hole mass distribution with black holes ranging from @xmath4 10@xmath120 to 10@xmath121 . according to our model , accretion onto such black holes",
    "can produce luminosities within the observed range @xmath122 erg / sec ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "if we allow for a higher black hole mass cut - off at @xmath124 we could obtain the break in the luminosity function .",
    "however , there is evidence for black holes with lower masses ( e.g. reid et al",
    ". , 1999 , sag a@xmath125 ) . therefore a break can not be imposing a simple cut - off mass .",
    "our model gives a consistent physical connection between high and low luminosity sources and does not predict a break in the luminosity function for the black hole mass distribution within the observed mass range .",
    "the model presented here can be extended and used for the study of the uv - background and the re - ionization history of the universe ( siemiginowska et al . , 2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "issues such as whether quasars are entirely responsible for the re - ionization of the universe or whether population iii stars are required ( see madau 1999 ) , the redshift at which it occurred , whether it is homogeneous or inhomogeneous or its effects on the primordial power spectrum , can be examined .",
    "the results are likely to be different from previous attempts because the emission spectrum derived from a non - stationary accretion disk is different from the one predicted by a stationary model at the uv wavelength range ( siemiginowska et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we presented a theoretical model for calculating the quasar luminosity function .",
    "this model , unlike previous ones , takes into account the physical processes occurring in the accretion disk around a black hole .",
    "black holes are assumed to form instantly within all dark matter halos , with masses related to the halo mass as : @xmath3 .",
    "we first restricted the range for the two free parameters of the model : the power spectrum exponent , @xmath0 and the ratio of black hole mass to dmh mass , @xmath59 .",
    "for any reasonable @xmath59 value , ( @xmath126 ) , @xmath0 has to be within the narrow range 1.6 to 1.8 in order to match the observed redshift of the peak of quasar evolution .",
    "we compared the predicted luminosity function to the data and found that a non - linear relation between the bh and dmh masses ( @xmath64 ) gives a much better approximation than a linear relation ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "our model predicts no break in the luminosity function , assuming quasars and seyfert galaxies to be objects of the same kind but of different luminosities .",
    "observationally this model is then equivalent to both ple and pde , but physically has quite different implications .",
    "no assumptions have been made on the merger processes , although they impact the quasar evolution .",
    "mergers that result in the black hole fusion ( and consequently in a decrease of the black hole space density ) will also influence the luminosity function at redshifts lower than @xmath100 , when mergers become important .",
    "we estimated that the merger rate should depend on redshift , @xmath5 , consistent with direct measurements .",
    "built into our model is the idea that quasar - like activity is a recurrent phenomenon .",
    "practically all galaxies go through that state many times during their lives .",
    "recent observations support the idea that black holes reside in all galaxies .",
