    "in the standard model ( sm ) the top quark is the only fermion with a mass at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and hence is speculated to be a window on new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "so far the tevatron has measured some properties of the top quark and found good agreements with the sm predictions except for the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath0 , which shows a @xmath6 deviation from the sm expectation @xcite .",
    "although the latest analysis based on the @xmath7 luminosity reduced the deviation to about @xmath8 , it indicated that the forward - backward asymmetry depends on the top pair invariant mass @xmath9 and for @xmath10 gev the deviation is enlarged to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "so far various new physics schemes have been proposed to explain such a deviation @xcite , among which one attractive way is the @xmath1-channel exchange of a neutral gauge boson @xmath12 which has sizable fcnc coupling for top and up quarks .",
    "these @xmath12-models are especially interesting because , in addition to contributing to @xmath13 , they can also induce the top quark fcnc decays and the like - sign top pair production at the lhc . due to their suppressed rates in the sm @xcite and the rather clean backgrounds @xcite , these fcnc decays and",
    "like - sign top pair production can be a good further test of the fcnc @xmath14 models for explaination of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the forward - backward asymmetry , the fcnc decays and the like - sign top pair production are correlated with each other and such correlations are model - dependent and thus can help to distinguish different models at the lhc . in this work we concentrate on two such @xmath12-models ,",
    "i.e. the left - right model and the @xmath3 model , to study the correlated effects of top quark forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron , the fcnc decays @xmath15 ( @xmath5 ) and the like - sign top pair production at the lhc .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe the two models and present the calculation of the observables . in sec .",
    "iii some numerical results are presented . finally , we draw conclusions in sec .",
    "in extensions of the sm with some extra gauge symmetry , a new neutral gauge boson called @xmath12 is often predicted with family universal or non - universal couplings to fermions . for a @xmath16 with family universal couplings",
    ", it contributes to the @xmath17 production only via the @xmath18-channel exchange shown in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "such @xmath18-channel contribution does not interfere with the dominant qcd amplitude and thus can not sizably enhance @xmath19 .",
    "however , the situation is quite different for a @xmath16 with non - universal couplings where the fcnc interaction @xmath20 may arise without violating the constraints from flavor physics @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath16 can contribute to @xmath17 production via the @xmath1-channel exchange shown in fig.[fig1](b ) , which , as pointed out in @xcite , can interfere with the qcd amplitude to enhance @xmath19 significantly while alter the cross section mildly . since we attempt to explain the deviation of @xmath19 by new physics effects , we in this work consider two models with non - universal @xmath16 couplings , which are called model - i and model - ii , respectively .",
    "model - i extends the sm by a @xmath21 gauge symmetry under which the three generations of the right - handed up - type quarks are charged as @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "therefore the new neutral gauge boson @xmath14 predicted in this model only couples to the right - handed quarks , and can safely escape the constraints from drell - yan measurement at the tevatron and lhc@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in this framework , the yukawa couplings may be generated by the froggatt - nielsen type mechanism @xcite and the chiral gauge anomalies can be avoided by introducing some extra fermions . the lagrangian relevant to our discussion is @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are dimensionless parameters , and @xmath26 is the generation index .",
    "recently , it is found that this model can explain the deviation of @xmath19 and meanwhile satisfy other tevatron measurements in the parameter region : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which is obtained by the following consideration @xcite :    * if @xmath16 is heavier than top quark , it will decay dominantly to @xmath30 or @xmath31 and consequently give excessive like - sign top quark events through the processes @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . *",
    "if @xmath16 is much lighter than top quark , the exotic decay @xmath35 is open . for @xmath36 with @xmath37",
    ", the decay rate will exceed @xmath38 , which can cause a tension between the dileptonic and hadronic channels for the @xmath17 production at the tevatron because such a light @xmath16 will decay into light quarks . *",
    "the presence of a small @xmath39 is necessary to make the model phenomenologically viable",
    ". if @xmath40 , the only decay mode of @xmath16 is @xmath41 , and then both @xmath42 and @xmath43 can give the very similar like - sign top pair signal , which is strongly constrained by the tevatron experiment .",
    "a non - zero @xmath39 can avoid this conflict by allowing @xmath16 to decay into @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath39 can not be too large because it can enhance the rates of both @xmath45 and the loop induced decay @xmath46 , which have been constrained by the measurements at the tevatron .",
    "model - ii is a special left - right symmetric model called the third - generation enhanced left - right model , which is based on the gauge group @xmath47 with gauge couplings @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively@xcite .",
    "the key feature of this model is that the gauge bosons of the @xmath52 group couple only to the third - generation fermions ( the third generation is specially treated ) @xcite .",
    "the gauge interactions relevant to our study are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the mixing angle between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the unitary matrices which rotate the right - handed quarks @xmath60 and @xmath61 from interaction basis to mass eigenstates and the repeated generation indices @xmath26 and @xmath62 are summed .",
    "similar to model - i , a sizable @xmath63 mixing with other flavor mixings suppressed is allowed by the low energy flavor physics @xcite .",
    "such a sizable @xmath63 mixing can lead to a rather strong @xmath64 interaction with the condition @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , the interaction to leptons are given as follows@xcite : @xmath66    the constraints on model - ii were found @xcite to be : @xmath67 from the requirement of perturbativity , @xmath68 gev for @xmath69 from the global fit of the lep data ( especially @xmath70 ) . among the oblique parameters",
    ", @xmath71 gives the most stringent constraint , which roughly requires @xmath72 at @xmath73 level .",
    "note that the constraints on @xmath74 from the cdf search for new resonant states or from the global fitting of the electroweak precision data are not applicable here since they usually assume a @xmath16 with family universal couplings . from the eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , we can see that the flavor - conserving interactions between the dominantly right - handed @xmath14 and the first two generation fermions are suppressed by small @xmath75 for the chosen parameters in our calculation , and thus make a negligible contribution to the process @xmath76 .",
    "eq.([neucoup ] ) indicates that , unlike model - i , model - ii gives an interaction @xmath77 larger than @xmath78 .",
    "although both models utilize the @xmath78 interaction to explain the deviation of @xmath79 , model - ii will have more side effects than model - i , e.g. , it may also alter sizably @xmath70 , the total and the differential rates of the @xmath17 production .",
    "the consideration of all these effects leads to a favorable region characterized by a very large @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) and a heavy @xmath16 ( @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "since both models allow for the fcnc @xmath78 interaction , they may predict large top quark fcnc decays @xmath83 ( @xmath5 ) and the like - sign top pair production , as shown in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "the analytic expressions of the loop amplitudes for the fcnc decays are given in appendix a. three points should be noted here .",
    "first , in model - i the processes @xmath84 and @xmath85 may lead to signals similar to the @xmath86 production , which , however , are suppressed by kinematics or high - order effects .",
    "second , in model - ii the decay @xmath87 can proceed at tree level via the @xmath88 mixing , while in model - i it can only occur at loop level .",
    "third , for the signature @xmath89 at the hera@xcite , in model i , the lepton - phobic @xmath14 will not contribute to this process and can safely avoid the constraints ; for the model ii , due to the large @xmath14 mass , the process @xmath89 is less sensitive to the coupling of @xmath90 .",
    "besides , as mentioned above , the small couplings(@xmath75 ) of @xmath91 will cancel the large flavor - changing coupling(@xmath92 ) of @xmath90 and also not give rise to the significant contribution to process @xmath93 .",
    "the sm parameters used in this calculations are @xcite @xmath94 for new physics parameters , we scan them within the following ranges : @xmath95    it should be noted that the contributions to the @xmath17 cross section mainly come from the flavor - changing t - channel in fig.1(b ) for both models . since the suppressions of small flavor - conserving coupling @xmath25 in model i and @xmath75 in model ii respectively and no interference with the sm qcd process , the s - channel @xmath96 has a negligible effects on the @xmath17 production for both models in our calculations . in additional ,",
    "the measurements of @xmath17 cross section at the lhc still have large uncertainties and may not give a new constraints on our two models@xcite . in our scan",
    ", we require the total cross section of the @xmath17 production and the differential cross section in each bin of @xmath9 to be within the @xmath6 regions of their experimental values at the tevatron@xcite . for model - ii",
    ", we also consider the constraint from the @xmath71 parameter at @xmath97 level @xcite . for the calculation of the hadronic cross sections",
    ", we use the parton distribution function cteq6l @xcite with the renormalization scale @xmath98 and factorization scale @xmath99 setting to be @xmath100 .      for each model",
    "we show in fig.4 the correlations between @xmath0 at the tevatron , the branch ratios of the top fcnc decays @xmath101 and the cross section of the @xmath86 production at the lhc with @xmath102tev .",
    "a common feature of the correlations is that all these quantities are proportional to each other .",
    "this is obvious since all the quantities receive contributions from the same @xmath78 interaction . for the forward - backward asymmetry",
    ", one can see that both models can enhance its value significantly to alleviate the deviation , especially , model - i can reduce the deviation to @xmath103 level .",
    "more details about the calculation of @xmath0 were presented in @xcite .    about",
    "the fcnc decays , fig.[fig4 ] shows that @xmath104 can have a large branching ratio in model - ii because it can proceed at tree level via the @xmath88 mixing . for each decay model - ii",
    "gives a larger branching ratio than model - i because in model - i the decays are highly suppressed by a factor @xmath105 .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] also indicates that in both models the branching ratios for these fcnc decays are smaller than @xmath106 , which are far below their current experimental bounds ( namely @xmath107 from d0 @xcite , @xmath108 from zeus , @xmath109 at 95% cl . using this limits and eq.(41 ) in arxiv : hep - ph/0003033 in ref[1 ]",
    ", we can obtain the upper limit @xmath110 . ] @xcite and @xmath111 from cdf @xcite ) and also smaller than the maximal values predicted in other new physics models such as low energy supersymmetry @xcite , technicolor model @xcite or little higgs theory @xcite . from the analysis of top fcnc",
    "decays @xcite , one can infer that detecting these decays in the present two models would be quite challenging at the lhc",
    ".    about the like - sign top pair production , fig.[fig4 ] shows that for @xmath112 the cross section in both models can be of @xmath113 order , reaching @xmath114 in model - i and @xmath115 in model - ii .",
    "since the signal of such a production is characterized by two isolated like - sign leptons , which is free from the @xmath17 background and the huge qcd @xmath116jets background @xcite , it may be observable at the lhc and will be discussed in the following .",
    "we note that very recently the cdf reported the dependence of @xmath79 on the top pair invariant mass @xmath9 and found a more than @xmath97 discrepancy from the sm prediction for @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we display the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath9 in fig.[fig5 ] . in our calculation",
    ", we have included the sm contribution and multiplied the total cross section by a k - factor @xmath118 to include the nlo qcd effect @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows that both models can enhance @xmath0 in large @xmath9 region to ameliorate the discrepancy , though the discrepancy still persists at @xmath6 level .",
    "further , we note that both models can also cause top quark polarization asymmetry in the @xmath119 production at the lhc , which was studied recently in @xcite .",
    "since the like - sign top production can have a large rate and its background is low , we give further study on its observability at the lhc .",
    "first , in fig.[fig6 ] we display some kinematical distributions such as the top quark transverse momentum @xmath120 and its pseudo - rapidity @xmath121 , the total transverse energy @xmath122 of the process and the separation between the two @xmath123-jets @xmath124 .",
    "the new physics parameters are fixed as @xmath125 and @xmath126 for model - i , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath129 for model - ii . for the last two distributions in fig.[fig6 ] , we have included the decay chain @xmath130 in our code to simulate the signals of the process . from the upper two and the last frames we can see that the most events are distributed in the region with small transverse momentum or large pseudo - rapidity .",
    "this implies that for a light @xmath16 in model - i the top quarks tend to outgo in parallel with the beam pipe .",
    "the third frame shows that the two @xmath123-jets tend to fly in the opposite direction since they come from the back - to - back top quarks in the @xmath86 rest frame .",
    "the distinct shapes in the second frame are caused by different masses of @xmath2 in the two models ( if the @xmath2 mass is assumed to be in the same region for both models , they give the similar shapes ) .",
    "now we discuss the detection of the @xmath86 production at the lhc with @xmath131 .",
    "we choose @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) as the signal .",
    "we simulate the energy resolution of the detector effects by assuming a gaussian smearing for the final leptons and jets @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135 is in gev , and @xmath136 indicates that the energy - dependent and energy - independent terms are added in quadrature .",
    "we take the @xmath123-jet tagging efficiency as @xmath137 .",
    "the main backgrounds are from @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which have been studied in @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we take the same cuts as in @xcite for the signal : @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the transverse energy and @xmath142 is the invariant mass of the final states .",
    "note that the production @xmath143 can also mimic our signal @xcite , which , however , has an extra jet and can be suppressed by jet veto .    under such cuts",
    "we find the acceptance rate of the signal is @xmath144 for @xmath145 in model - i and @xmath146 for @xmath129 in model - ii .",
    "the acceptance rate is found to increase with @xmath74 , which is @xmath147 for @xmath148 and increased to @xmath149 for @xmath150 . with the backgrounds calculated in @xcite",

    "<S> the anomaly of the top quark forward - backward asymmetry @xmath0 observed at the tevatron can be explained by the @xmath1-channel exchange of a neutral gauge boson ( @xmath2 ) which has sizable flavor changing coupling for top and up quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this gauge boson can also induce the top quark flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) decays and the like - sign top pair production at the lhc . in this work we focus on two models which predict such a @xmath2 , namely the left - right model and the @xmath3 model , to investigate the correlated effects on @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the fcnc decays @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and the like - sign top pair production at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we also pay special attention to the most recently measured @xmath0 in the large top pair invariant mass region . </S>",
    "<S> we find that under the current experimental constraints both models can alleviate the deviation of @xmath0 and , meanwhile , enhance the like - sign top pair production to the detectable level of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the two models give different predictions for the observables and their correlations , and thus they may even be distinguished by jointly studying these top quark observables . </S>"
