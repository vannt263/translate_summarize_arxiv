    "effects of ferromagnetism have been known since antiquity . but a mathematical understanding of the microscopic origin of ferromagnetism has remained somewhat elusive , until today ! pauli paramagnetism , ferro- , ferri- and antiferromagnetism are quantum phenomena connected to the spin of electrons and to pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "the theory of _ paramagnetism _ in ( free ) electron gases is quite straightforward , @xcite .",
    "_ antiferromagnetism _ is relatively well understood : a mechanism for the generation of antiferromagnetic exchange interactions has been proposed by anderson @xcite , who discovered a close relationship between the half - filled hubbard model and the heisenberg antiferromagnet using perturbative methods ; ( see also @xcite for mathematically more compelling and more general variants of anderson s key observation ) .",
    "it has been proven rigorously by dyson , lieb and simon @xcite , using the method of infrared bounds previously discovered in @xcite , that the _ quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet _ with nearest - neighbour exchange couplings exhibits a phase transition accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of gapless spin waves , as the temperature is lowered , in _ three _ or _ more _ dimensions .",
    "( the mermin - wagner theorem says that , in ( one and ) two dimensions , continuous symmetries can not be broken spontaneously in models with short - range interactions , @xcite . )",
    "our mathematical understanding of _ ferromagnetism _ is far less advanced .",
    "some kind of heuristic theory of ferromagnetism emerged , long ago , in the classic works of heisenberg , bloch , stoner , dyson , landau and lifshitz , and others @xcite .",
    "various insights have been gained on the basis of some form of mean - field theory , with small fluctuations around mean - field theory taken into account within a linear approximation .",
    "this approximation , however , is known to break down in the vicinity of the critical point of a ferromagnetic material , where nonlinear fluctuations play a crucial role , @xcite .    in a variety of tight - binding models of itinerant electrons ,",
    "ferromagnetic order has been exhibited in the _ ground state _",
    "( i.e. , at zero temperature ) ; see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "one of these models is a fairly natural two - band model in which ferromagnetism arises from a competition between electron hopping , coulomb repulsion and an on - site hund s rule , @xcite .",
    "( hund s rule says that the spin - tripled state of two electrons occupying the same site is energetically favoured over the spin - singlet state .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that a mathematically rigorous derivation of hund s rule in atomic physics from first principles has _ not _ been accomplished , so far . )",
    "none of the results in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite comes close to providing some understanding of ferromagnetic order and of an order - disorder phase transition at _ positive _ temperature .",
    "it is not known how to derive , with mathematical precision , an effective hamiltonian with explicit ferromagnetic exchange couplings from the microscopic schrdinger equation , or a tight - binding approximation thereof , of ferromagnetic materials .",
    "but even if we resort to a phenomenological description of such materials in terms of models where ferromagnetic exchange couplings have been put in _ by hand _ we face the problem that we are unable to exhibit ferromagnetic order at low enough temperature and to establish an order - disorder phase transition in three or more dimensions . _",
    "no mathematically rigorous proof _ of the phase transition in the _ quantum heisenberg ferromagnet _ is known , to date ! ( such a result has , however , been established for _ classical _ heisenberg models in @xcite . )",
    "ab - initio quantum monte carlo simulations of models of quantum ferromagnets are plagued by the well known `` sign- ( or complex - phase ) problem '' .",
    "thus , until now , there are neither substantial mathematically rigorous results on , nor are there reliable ab - initio numerical simulations of , realistic models of ferromagnetic metals , such as ni , co or fe ! given that ferromagnetism is among the most striking _ macroscopic _ manifestations - apparent , e.g. , in the needle of a compass - of the _ quantum - mechanical _ nature of matter , this is clearly a desolate state of affairs .",
    "in the present paper we shall not remedy this unsatisfactory situation .",
    "however , first , we attempt to draw renewed attention to it , and , second , we outline a formalism and some fairly elementary analytical observations of which we hope that they will ultimately lead to a better , mathematically rather precise understanding of ferromagnetism . were it not known already , our analysis and the one in @xcite would make clear that ferromagnetism is a non - perturbative phenomenon involving strong correlations and gapless modes . to understand it mathematically will most probably necessitate a full - fledged _ multi - scale _ ( renormalization group ) _ analysis_. the formalism presented in this paper and our calculations are intended to provide a convenient starting point for such an analysis .    analytical work on ferromagnetism may seem to be rather unfashionable . however , there are recent developments , such as spintronics , fast magnetic devices , etc . that may make work like ours appear worthwhile . our own motivation for the work that led to this paper actually originated in studying recent experiments with beams of spin - polarized , hot electrons shot through ferromagnetically ordered films consisting of ni , co or fe that were carried out in the group of h.c .",
    "siegmann at eth ; see @xcite,@xcite . back in 1998",
    ", it became clear to one of us that the concept of the `` _ weiss exchange field _ ''",
    "( see @xcite,@xcite ) would play a useful role in a theoretical interpretation of the experimental results reported in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "more generally , the weiss exchange field appears to offer a key to a systematic study of phase transitions in magnetic materials , magnetic order , spin precession and magnon dynamics . in this paper , we focus on elucidating the microscopic origin of the weiss exchange field , the role it plays in the theory of magnetism , and its dynamics .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the experiments reported in @xcite,@xcite and sketch a phenomenological interpretation , based on scattering theory , of the results found in these experiments , merely adding some conceptual remarks to the discussion of our experimental colleagues and describing the role played by the weiss exchange field .",
    "we also propose some further experiments , in particular a stern - gerlach experiment for electrons traversing an inhomogeneous exchange field .    a mathematically precise analysis of the scattering of electrons ( or neutrons , photons , ... ) at dynamical targets , such as magnetic films , metallic solids , liquid droplets , ... , will appear elsewhere ; ( some first results appear in @xcite ) .    in section 3 , we reformulate one - band @xmath1 and hubbard models in terms of a dynamical weiss exchange field . for this purpose ,",
    "the standard imaginary - time functional integral formalism for the analysis of thermal equilibrium states of quantum many - body systems is recalled .",
    "the _ weiss exchange field _ is seen to be a lagrange - multiplier field in a hubbard - stratonovich transformation of the original functional integral that renders the action functional quadratic in the grassmann variables describing the electronic degrees of freedom ; see e.g. @xcite,@xcite . the effective field theory of the weiss exchange field",
    "is obtained after integrating over those grassmann variables .",
    "the effective ( imaginary - time ) action functional of the exchange field and identities for green functions of spin operators are derived .    in section 4 ,",
    "we determine the leading terms of the effective action of the weiss exchange field , @xmath2 , in the approximation where fluctuations of the _ length _ of the exchange field are neglected . for this purpose",
    ", we derive the ferro- and antiferromagnetic mean - field equations from the exact effective action of the exchange field . by solving these equations",
    "we determine the most likely length , @xmath3 , of the exchange field .",
    "from that point on , the length of the exchange field is frozen to be @xmath4 .",
    "we then consider a one - band hubbard model with a half - filled band and find that , in this situation , the effective action of @xmath5 is the one of a nonlinear @xmath6-model with a minimum that favours nel order .",
    "this result is found on the basis of controlled perturbative calculations and goes beyond linear stability analysis of the antiferromagnetic mean - field solution , ( which has been presented , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "it represents a functional - integral version of anderson s basic observations @xcite .",
    "we then turn to ferromagnetically ordered mean field solutions and show that @xmath7-independent fluctuations are not a source of instability of such a solution .",
    "then we consider a one - band hubbard model with a weakly filled , fairly flat band .",
    "in this situation one expects that ferromagnetism prevails .",
    "indeed , we find that , at low temperatures , the ferromagnetic mean - field equation has a non - trivial solution , and that this solution belongs to a _ quadratically stable _ critical point of the effective action of w. this conclusion is the result of somewhat subtle calculations involving processes close to the fermi surface , which make the dominant contribution ( but would lead to small - energy denominators in a purely perturbative analysis ) .",
    "details will appear in @xcite .",
    "our calculations support the idea that the one - band hubbard model with a weakly filled , fairly flat band describes coexistence of metallic behaviour with ferromagnetic order , at sufficiently low temperatures . a similar conclusion was reached , tentatively , in @xcite for some two - band hund - hubbard models .",
    "the methods of the present paper also apply to the model discussed in @xcite ; see @xcite .    in the next to last subsection of section 4",
    ", we exhibit a universal wess - zumino term in the effective action of the weiss exchange field @xmath5 and calculate its coefficient , which is purely imaginary .",
    "the wess - zumino term is `` irrelevant '' for antiferromagnets , but plays a _",
    "crucial _ role in the dynamics of magnons in _ ferromagnetically _ ordered systems . repeating arguments in @xcite , we derive the landau - lifshitz equations for magnons in a ferromagnet .    finally , we draw attention to two well known arguments explaining why there is no magnetic ordering at positive temperature , in one and two dimensions ; ( but see @xcite ) .    in section 5 , we sketch novel rigorous proofs , based on analyzing the effective field theory of the exchange field , @xmath5 , of the existence of phase transitions and magnetic order at low temperatures in a class of @xmath0-models , heisenberg antiferromagnets and ferromagnets of localized @xmath8- spins , for @xmath9 .",
    "see @xcite for the original results .",
    "our proof is based on establishing reflection positivity of the effective field theory of the exchange field @xmath5 and then using the original techniques developed in @xcite ; ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the concept of the weiss exchange field has a number of further , quite exciting applications .",
    "we hope to return to these matters in future papers .",
    "some of the material in this paper has a review character ; but some of it is new .",
    "we hope it is fairly easy to read .",
    "if it draws renewed attention to some of the deep technical problems in the quantum theory of magnetism it has fulfilled its purpose .",

    "the group velocity of the electrons inside the film is denoted by @xmath15 ; it is not directly measurable , but it is comparable to @xmath16 , where @xmath14 is the average potential energy of an electron and @xmath17 its effective mass inside the film . * the degree , @xmath18 , and the direction , @xmath19 , of the spin polarization of the incident electron beam ; ( in fig .",

    "experimentally , the angle @xmath27 is found to be considerably smaller than @xmath26 , i.e. , the spins of the transmitted electrons rotate into the direction of the spontaneous magnetization @xmath24 of the film .",
    "this is interpreted as being mainly due to an enhanced absorption of minority - spin electrons , as compared to majority - spin electrons ; see ( vi ) .",

    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 can be measured and yield the spin - transmission asymmetry @xmath45 @xmath46 is found to be positive and large .",
    "this is interpreted in terms of rates of transitions of electrons into unoccupied 3d states ( holes ) : there are more unoccupied 3d states in the film with spin antiparallel to @xmath24 ( minority spin ) than with spin parallel to @xmath24 ( majority spin ) .",
    "this explains qualitatively the experimental results found for @xmath46 and for @xmath47 ( see ( iv ) ) ; @xcite . * the orbital deflection angle , @xmath48 , between the directions of the incident and the transmitted beam ( not indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp1 ] ) . experimentally @xmath48",
    "is found to be negligibly small .",
    "this tells us that the integrated lorentz force on the electrons transmitted through the film is tiny .",
    "the precession of the spins of the electrons when they traverse the film can therefore _ not _ be explained by zeeman coupling of the spins to the magnetic field inside the layer .",
    "it is mainly due to zeeman coupling of the spins to what will be called the _",
    "weiss exchange field_. in iron , the weiss exchange field causing the observed spin precession would correspond to a magnetic field of roughly 8000 tesla ( which is gigantic ) .",
    "a theoretical interpretation of the experimental results reported in @xcite can be attempted within the formalism of _ scattering theory_. if the luminosity of the incident beam is low we can consider a single incoming electron .",
    "the incoming state is described as a tensor product of a pauli spinor , @xmath49 , describing the incident electron and a state , @xmath50 , of the film .",
    "typically , @xmath50 is the ground state ( temperature @xmath51 ) or a thermal equilibrium state ( @xmath52 ) of the film .",
    "the outcoming state , long after the interactions between an outgoing electron and the film have taken place , is more complicated and will , in general , exhibit _ entanglement _ between the electron and the degrees of freedom of the film .",
    "if only measurements far away from the film are performed , as in @xcite , the outgoing state can be described as a density matrix @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a non - negative , trace - class operator on the hilbert space of @xmath55 _ outgoing electrons _ ( the incident electron has knocked @xmath56 electrons out of the film ) , @xmath57 ; @xmath58 is a non - negative number , the _ absorption probability _ , @xmath59 is a non - negative trace - class operator on the hilbert space @xmath60 of square - integrable pauli spinors and describes the ( generally _ mixed _ ) state of _ one _ outgoing electron . ``",

    "this is justified , because the degrees of freedom of the film are _ not _ observed in the experiment .",
    "if the energy , @xmath11 , of the incident electron is below ( or comparable to ) the threshold , @xmath63 , for emission of two or more electrons from the film then @xmath64 in the interpretation of the experimental data provided in @xcite , this is tacitly assumed .    experimentally , the absorption probability @xmath58 and the spin polarizations @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the incoming and the outgoing electron , respectively , are measured .",

    "apparently , @xmath76 has not been measured accurately , yet .    a moment",
    "s reflection shows that spin flip processes accompanied by magnon emission in the film ( `` stoner excitations '' ) lead to entanglement ; while absorption of electrons into unoccupied 3d states need not be correlated with entanglement of the states of _ those _ electrons that _ do _ traverse the film .",
    "in fact , it is implicitly assumed in @xcite that if stoner excitations are neglected then @xmath74 is close to a pure state ( at least in spin - space ) .",
    "the experimental techniques of @xcite could be used to test this hypothesis .",
    "next , we express the spin transmission asymmetry @xmath46 ( see ( vi ) ) in terms of outgoing states .",

    "<S> the huge spin precession frequency observed in recent experiments with spin - polarized beams of hot electrons shot through magnetized films is interpreted as being caused by zeeman coupling of the electron spins to the so - called _ weiss exchange field _ in the film . </S>",
    "<S> a `` stern - gerlach experiment '' for electrons moving through an inhomogeneous exchange field is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic origin of exchange interactions and of large mean exchange fields , leading to different types of magnetic order , is elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> a microscopic derivation of the equations of motion of the weiss exchange field is presented . </S>",
    "<S> novel proofs of the existence of phase transitions in quantum @xmath0-models and antiferromagnets , based on an analysis of the statistical distribution of the exchange field , are outlined . </S>"
