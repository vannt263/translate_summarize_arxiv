    "<S> first - principles dft calculations of the electronic structure and absorption spectra support this explanation and show that the main contribution to these optical transitions comes from @xmath5 and @xmath6 points of the 2d bz , which originate from @xmath7 and @xmath5 points of the 3d bz . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath0 series of transitions at the @xmath1 point is well described by the multiband effective - mass model . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the uv exciton bands reveals tunable optical properties of cadmium chalcogenide npls in uv spectral region , which may be interesting for practical applications . </S>"
