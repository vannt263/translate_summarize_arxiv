    "knowledge of physical conditions ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) is an essential ingredient in the understanding of planetary nebulae .",
    "information on the structure , chemistry and kinematics of these objects comes from individual diagnostics and from the cross - comparison of different diagnostics . in this work",
    ", two different diagnostics will be used to investigate the physical conditions in the planetary nebula ngc 6543 : the temperature - sensitive [ o  iii ] ratio @xmath11 , and the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) diagnostic diagram based on the [ o  iii ] optical and infrared lines , which was first proposed by @xcite ( henceforth dlw ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "the first method , the one based on the @xmath11 ratio , is one of the most popular ones .",
    "advantages of this method are that the lines involved are bright , and close enough to be easily observed with the same instrumental setup ; a caution to be taken is that this ratio selectively samples the hottest zones , so that in presence of strong temperature fluctuations the derived temperature , @xmath8o@xmath9 , is biased towards the highest values ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , this ratio measures the temperature of the o@xmath0 region , which is not necessarily representative of the whole observed volume .",
    "the second method , the diagnostic diagram by dlw , allows the simultaneous determination of the electron density and temperature by combining the optical and the fir fine - structure [ o  iii ] lines .",
    "the two infrared lines [ o  iii ] 52@xmath12 and 88@xmath12 arise from low - energy levels of the ground term , so their ratio 52@xmath12/88@xmath12 is almost insensitive to the temperature , while the critical densities of their upper levels are different , so the ratio is strongly sensitive to density . on the other hand ,",
    "a ratio like @xmath3/52@xmath12 is strongly dependent on temperature , due to the very different excitation energies of the upper levels of the two lines , and it has a weak dependence on density too , due to the difference in the critical densities . by combining the two line ratios , one can obtain a simultaneous measurement of the electron temperature , @xmath8o@xmath10 , and density , @xmath13o@xmath10 ( we will use throughout the text the subindex _ ir _ when referring to these @xmath1 and @xmath2 determinations , though an optical line is involved also ; this choice responds to simplicity criteria , and highlights the fact that the density is , to a good approximation , a function of the ratio of the two infrared lines alone ) .",
    "one of the main advantages of this method is its internal consistency , since all the lines involved belong to the same ion , so that the same volume is mapped to derive both temperature and density ( although the optical and infrared emissivities might follow different distributions within the o@xmath0 zone if temperature or density fluctuations are present ) .",
    "two major disadvantages are consequences of the lines involved lying far apart in the spectrum : first , the lines must be observed with different instruments , a procedure implying the risk of systematic offsets in the calibration ; and second , any uncertainty in the reddening correction is amplified by the large wavelength baseline .    by means of these methods ,",
    "we want to reassess the physical conditions in the bright core of ngc 6543 .",
    "a similar analysis was performed on a small sample of pne , including ngc 6543 itself , by dlw .",
    "these authors used infrared data obtained with the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ) , and complemented them with optical spectra from the lick observatory crossley reflector ; the analysis was later repeated by @xcite ( henceforth dhew ) , with quite different results . in the work we present here",
    ", the intensity of the infrared lines is obtained from iso archive spectra , and the intensity of [ o  iii ] @xmath3 and [ o  iii ] @xmath4 from hst archive images .",
    "additionally , h@xmath7 and h@xmath14 hst images were used to determine the reddening correction to be applied to the other images , and narrow band hst images around @xmath15 were used to correct the h@xmath7 images for the [ n  ii ] contribution .",
    "finally , long - slit , ground - based data obtained with the isaac newton telescope at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos were used to correct the hst images for the contribution of other lines and the continuum .",
    "these data will be described in sections  [ sec : isodata ] ,  [ sec : intdata ] and  [ sec : hstdata ] .",
    "ngc 6543 ( the ` cat s eye ' ) is a very well known , low - excitation planetary nebula .",
    "many studies have been devoted to understand its complex structure ; an incomplete list of the most recent ones includes @xcite .",
    "the bright core of the nebula can be roughly described as the superposition of two ellipses , equal in shape but perpendicular to each other @xcite .",
    "this region is about @xmath16 in diameter , and can be seen in direct images in the balmer and [ o  iii ] lines .",
    "other structures form part of the nebula : surrounding the bright core , a series of dim concentric rings is visible in [ o  iii ] , extending at least out to @xmath17 @xcite ; in turn , the rings are surrounded by a giant filamentary halo of about @xmath18 in diameter @xcite ; x - ray emission coming from the bubble surrounding the central star has been recently reported by @xcite ; the variability of the central star has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "ngc 6543 was routinely observed by iso for calibration purposes , thereby a large set of spectra is available .",
    "we selected 20 out of the 92 long - wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) spectra of ngc 6543 available in the iso data archive , all of them in the aot l01 observing mode ; the selected spectra were taken during two separate periods , close to the beginning and the end of iso operational life respectively ( see table  [ tab : isojournal ] ) .",
    "a detailed explanation of the lws structure and data sets is provided in _ the iso handbook , vol .",
    "iv , lws - the long wavelength spectrometer _ @xcite .",
    "each spectrum is comprised of 10 independent wavelength ranges , which correspond to the 10 detectors that form the lws .",
    "these wavelength ranges overlap partially .",
    "both emission lines considered by us fall in the overlap region of two consecutive ranges : i.e. , [ o  iii ] 52@xmath12 falls on both the sw1 and sw2 detectors , while [ o iii ] 88@xmath12 falls on both the sw5 and lw1 detectors .",
    "additionally , the spectrum of each of these 10 wavelength ranges is composed of 6 sub - exposures , that correspond to independent scans of the detector .",
    "thus , we can in principle perform , in our sample , ( 20 spectra ) @xmath19 ( 2 detectors ) @xmath19 ( 6 scans ) = 240 independent measures for any of the two emission lines of interest , or 120 with each detector . in practice ,",
    "the number of independent measurements of a given line with a given detector is smaller than 120 , due to the following reasons : in a few cases , one or two out of the six scans of a given exposure do not span the whole detector range , failing to include the line ; in other cases the quality of the spectrum is very poor , so that the line - intensity measurement is unfeasible .",
    "however , the measurements are still numerous enough ( 77 on average per line and detector ) to adequately sample the data distribution .",
    "the data were reduced using the latest version of the iso automatic analysis pipeline available in november 2001 .",
    "the flux measurements were performed by model gaussian fitting .",
    "figure  [ fig : iso ] represents the continuum flux versus emission line intensity for all the measurements of the two features , 52@xmath12 and 88@xmath12 . in the upper plot ,",
    "the filled dots and the open circles represent the data taken with the sw1 and the sw2 detectors respectively ; in the lower plot , the dots and the open circles represent the data taken with the sw5 and the lw1 detectors respectively .",
    "the ellipses delimit the region within 1-@xmath20 from the median values .",
    "table  [ tab : isodata ] summarizes the median and dispersion values of the continuum and line measurements for the four detectors .",
    "the data of each epoch are shown both as individual data sets , and combined together .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the data sample :    * the sw1 and sw5 continuum data are much more spread out than the corresponding sw2 and lw1 data ; * the median intensity values of the 88@xmath12 line obtained with sw5 and lw1 are in excellent agreement , whereas the median intensity values of the 52@xmath12 line obtained with sw1 and sw2 are more discrepant , although they still agree at the 1-@xmath20 level ; * the median intensity values of the 52@xmath12 line obtained with sw1 suffered a drift of more than 1@xmath20 from epoch i ( june 1996 + july 1996 ) to epoch ii ( december 1997 + january 1998 ) .",
    "this long term drift is known and documented in the iso lws handbook .",
    "based on these results , we decided to perform our analysis on the line intensities measured with the sw2 and lw1 detectors only , neglecting the data obtained with the other two detectors .",
    "the exclusion of sw1 is primarily motivated by the drift in the line flux data , which make them unreliable . on the other hand ,",
    "the exclusion of sw5 is only motivated by the larger spread in the continuum data with respect to those of the lw1 detector , a feature that does not necessarily imply a lower quality of the line fluxes obtained with this detector .",
    "in fact , since sw5 has a spectral resolution twice that of lw1 , the recorded dust continuum level per resolution element is lower , making this detector more sensitive to the dark current subtraction : as a result , a fraction of the larger spread in the sw5 continuum data may be caused by the uncertainties in the subtraction of the dark current , an uncertainty not affecting the line fluxes .",
    "nonetheless , we preferred to adopt a conservative approach and exclude both sw1 and sw5 from our analysis .",
    "with such a choice , the adopted line intensities are :    @xmath21    and @xmath22 where the quoted value is the median of the sample , and the uncertainty is the dispersion in the data , which does not include possible systematic error sources , such as , e.g. , the flux calibration .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with those reported by @xcite , @xmath23 erg sec@xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 erg sec@xmath24 @xmath25 , although @xcite quote rather small uncertainties .    a flux correction factor",
    "should be applied to take into account the extension of the source , since the iso lws analysis pipeline is calibrated on uranus and it assumes that the target is a point source .",
    "this flux correction factor accounts for the relation between the iso telescope point spread function and the lws instrumental profile .",
    "dlw applied the corresponding flux correction to their kao data , a correction that was quite small , amounting to only 4% for the @xmath5 line . in our case ,",
    "the fraction of flux diffracted out of the aperture is even smaller , and it is therefore negligible with respect to the other uncertainties involved in the process , such as , e.g. , the flux calibration itself .",
    "consequently , we did not apply any correction for this effect .",
    "ngc 6543 was observed spectroscopically as part of a wider study of pne on 1995 july 8 and 9 .",
    "we used the intermediate dispersion spectrograph attached to the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , on la palma .",
    "the @xmath27 slit was placed at position angles 5@xmath28 and 20@xmath28 , and included the central star .",
    "the r1200b grating and the tek3 ccd in the 235 mm camera provide a dispersion of 0.85  / pixel and a spatial sampling of 0.71@xmath29/pixel .",
    "the seeing was stable at 1.1@xmath29 , and the integration time was 1000 s. the spectra were calibrated using the standard steps of flat fielding , bias subtraction , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration using flux spectroscopic standard stars observed during the same night and with the same setup , but through a 10 arcsec wide slit ; the spectra were also corrected for light dispersion inside the spectrograph .",
    "the inset in the top panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] illustrates the very high quality of these data , showing a logarithmic plot of a sample nebular spectrum in the wavelength range 34004500  .",
    "these data form part of a much larger data set that will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the hst data archive at st - ecf was queried for wfpc2 images of ngc 6543 .",
    "we retrieved images through the narrow band filters f437n , f487n , f502n , f656n , and f658n , centered on the emission lines [ o  iii ] @xmath4 , h@xmath14 , [ o  iii ] @xmath3 , h@xmath7 , and [ n  ii ] @xmath30 respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : hstjournal ] summarizes these data sets . for each filter ,",
    "the different exposures were combined with the iraf / stsdas command crrej , to obtain a final image at each waveband free of cosmic rays . in each of these images ,",
    "the fluxes were measured within the pc frame of the wfpc2 .",
    "similar analyses have been performed by @xcite and @xcite for ngc 6543 , and @xcite for ngc 7009 .",
    "since our results differ from those of both @xcite and @xcite , we will describe our procedure in full detail , so as to allow future identification of the causes behind the discrepancies .",
    "the calibration is conceptually straightforward , but the procedure contains several potential pitfalls , such as , e.g. , the zeropoint calibration , the adoption of the proper width for the filter , or the estimation of the contribution to the flux of the continuum and of neighbouring lines .",
    "the zeropoint of an instrument is defined as the intrinsic flux of an object producing one count per second .",
    "the raw data number ( dn : the ratio between the electron count in each pixel , and the gain factor , which is 7 in our case ) obtained from the hst images must be multiplied by the appropriate zeropoint in order to obtain the flux in energy units .",
    "the zeropoint for the wfpc2 is codified in the header word photflam . as many other calibration parameters",
    ", photflam has been periodically modified , as the calibration routine improved .",
    "the photflam values can be found either in the header of the images , or in the hst - wfpc2 data handbook @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the two sources give different values ; the difference is quite sizeable ( almost 4% ) in the case of the h@xmath7 filter f656n , and smaller than 1% for the other filters .",
    "as the hst helpdesk advised us to do , we sticked to the photflam values of the wfpc2 data handbook , which are listed in table  [ tab : hstjournal ] .",
    "the narrow wfpc2 filters are characterized by several parameters .",
    "one of them is the filter s rectangular width rectw , defined as the width in   of a rectangle with the same total area as the total transmission curve , which describes the transmittance of the system , and height given by the peak in the curve .",
    "since the dn is given per unit wavelength , the data measured in the wfpc2 images must be multiplied by the rectw value of the corresponding filter . as already noted by @xcite , rectw",
    "should not be confused with the @xmath31 values given in the wfpc2 instrument handbook ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 1 ) .",
    "rectw can be computed for each filter with the iraf task synphot / bandpas .",
    "the values for the filters considered in this work are given in table  [ tab : hstjournal ] .",
    "the pc frame is a square of 800 @xmath19 800 pixels , corresponding to about @xmath32 .",
    "the central @xmath33 pixels were excluded , to avoid contamination by the central star .",
    "the outermost pixel rows and columns are affected by optical problems related to the spherical aberration of the telescope . due to the low photometric quality of these pixel rows",
    "they were excluded from our analysis , and the flux was measured in a square of 690 @xmath19 670 pixels , corresponding to about @xmath34 .",
    "this square is smaller than the field of view of the iso lws , which has a diameter of about @xmath35 at the wavelengths of interest .",
    "however , the flux emitted by the nebula is completely dominated by the innermost @xmath36 , which accounts for more than 97 percent of the total ( figure  [ fig : oiiiradi ] ) , and the two instruments effectively sample the same area ( this is also shown , e.g. , by the brightness distribution of the [ ne  iii ] line at @xmath37 : see * ? ? ?",
    "this issue is also addressed by dlw , who match the kao @xmath38 aperture by taking the ground based observations of [ o  iii]@xmath3 and h@xmath14 through @xmath39 and @xmath17 diameter apertures , and using the [ o  iii]@xmath4 fluxes by @xcite through a similarly wide aperture .",
    "a fraction of the flux measured in each filter is contributed by lines other than the principal line . in the case of the four filters we considered , f487n and f502n contain only h@xmath14 and @xmath3 respectively , whereas f437n includes h@xmath40 @xmath41 and he  i @xmath42 , and f656n includes [ n  ii ] @xmath43 , 6584 . in this section , we describe the procedure followed to subtract these contributions from the total measured fluxes .    the total flux of [ n  ii ] @xmath30 was computed from an image taken with the f658n filter , and then subtracted from the f656n image taking into account the transmission efficiency of the filter at the position of @xmath30 .",
    "the [ n  ii ] @xmath44 contribution was computed theoretically from the flux of [ n  ii ] @xmath30 .",
    "since the f658n filter is , in turn , contaminated by h@xmath7 , the decontamination procedure was iterated to give decontaminated h@xmath7 and [ n  ii ] @xmath30 flux values .",
    "after this procedure was applied , the total h@xmath7 flux lowered by about 3% .",
    "the total flux in the f437n filter includes contributions of h@xmath40 @xmath41 and he  i @xmath45 .",
    "both contributions are difficult to estimate , since they depend on the exact position of the line in the filter . in the case of",
    "he  i @xmath45 , the intensity of the line itself is also unknown , whereas the total intensity of h@xmath40 can be computed from @xmath46h@xmath47 .",
    "we estimated these contributions multiplying the nebular spectrum of the long - slit spectra ( with the central star excluded ) by the f437n transmission curve , and then measuring separately each component on the resulting pattern .",
    "the top panel in figure  [ fig : spec ] shows the nebular spectrum of ngc 6543 along position angle 5@xmath28 in the wavelength region around h@xmath40 4340 , [ o  iii ] 4363 and he  i 4388 .",
    "the dashed line is the actual spectrum , while the full line is this spectrum convolved with the hst f437n filter response ( the total system peak response of 0.03 @xcite has been divided out so as to make the two spectra comparable ) .",
    "the inset shows a sample of the spectrum along the slit in a logarithmic scale , to provide an indication of the high s / n of this data set .",
    "we found that h@xmath40 and he  i @xmath45 contribute on average 12% and 4% respectively to the total flux in f437n , while [ o  iii ] @xmath4 provides on average 26% of the flux , with a typical deviation of 3% .",
    "this is plotted in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] , which shows the contribution of @xmath4 to the total intensity in f437n , normalized to 100 ( dotted circles , left handside scale ; the central @xmath48 are excluded from the analysis ) ; the rest of the flux detected through the filter is contributed by h@xmath40 and he  i 4388 , other very faint emission lines , and by the underlying nebular continuum ( see top panel ) .",
    "also plotted for reference is the variation of the [ o  iii ] 4363 line intensity along the slit ( solid line , right hand side scale ) .",
    "the underlying continuum contributing within each of the hst images can be ascertained either theoretically or empirically .",
    "the first method requires a detailed computation of the efficiency of all the processes involved , while the second consists in measuring on a spectrum the relative importance of each line with respect to the underlying continuum , with the filter s transmittance curve taken into account .",
    "we chose to do it both ways , since the comparison between the results illustrates quantitatively the difficulties of an accurate theoretical computation of the nebular processes .",
    "the processes contributing to the nebular continuum flux are h  i , he  i , and he  ii recombination , bremsstrahlung , and 2-photon decay .",
    "the relative importance of these processes depends on both the wavelength and the nebular electron temperature , and on the he  i and he  ii abundances .",
    "table  [ tab : continuum ] shows the frequency dependence of the continuum - emission coefficient , @xmath49 , for each process at the three wavelengths of interest , in units 10@xmath50 erg @xmath51 sec@xmath24 hz@xmath24 ; the data have been obtained interpolating in the ( @xmath52 , log @xmath49 ) plane between the values listed by @xcite at @xmath53 k.    the 2-photon continuum intensity is quite difficult to compute accurately , as it depends not only on the local physical conditions @xmath2 and @xmath1 , but also on the fate of the ly@xmath7 photons produced by recombination . in optically thin or dusty nebulae ,",
    "all the electrons on the 2@xmath54p level produce a ly@xmath7 photon that eventually escapes from the nebula or is destroyed by dust , whereas those on the 2@xmath54s level decay to the ground state producing 2-photon continuum , the population on 2@xmath54s and 2@xmath54p levels being determined by the recombination cascade and the mutual collisional transitions . in practice , ly@xmath7 photons can be scattered repeatedly before they escape from the nebula , and at each scattering the absorbing electron has a finite probability of suffering a 2@xmath54p @xmath55 2@xmath54s transition and decaying via 2-photon emission .",
    "thus , with given local physical conditions ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) , the actual 2-photon emission can vary from a minimum value ( corresponding to the case in which all the ly@xmath7 photons are either destroyed by dust or escape from the nebula ) to a maximum value ( corresponding to the case in which all the ly@xmath7 photons are eventually converted to 2-photon continuum ) . in table",
    "[ tab : continuum ] and figure  [ fig : continuum ] we represent , as a function of the wavelength , the two limiting values for the 2-photon continuum , and the corresponding values for the total continuum .",
    "the impact of the occurrence of ly@xmath7 conversion on the total continuum level depends on the wavelength considered ; in the case of the wavelength range around @xmath56 4363 , where 2-photon emission is a dominant process , ly@xmath7 conversion can enhance the total continuum by as much as a factor 2.5",
    ". this would be the asymptotic case of a very thick , dust - free nebula , and represents just an upper limit to be considered in the following .",
    "we assumed in the calculations @xmath53 k and @xmath57 @xmath58 ; the density corresponds to the observed @xmath59 ratio : see section  [ sec : nt_ir ] .",
    "the collisional rates listed by @xcite for the 2@xmath54s @xmath55 2@xmath54p transition have been linearly extrapolated in temperature down to @xmath53 k ; this might seem a rough approximation , but our results are fairly insensitive to it , both because the collisional data at @xmath60 and @xmath61 k are quite similar , and because collisions are outnumbered by spontaneous decays at these nebular conditions anyway .",
    "the he  ii recombination continuum is not listed because it is not relevant for ngc 6543 , due to the low he@xmath0 abundance ( @xmath62 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , @xmath63 ,",
    "so that the he  i recombination continuum can not be neglected .",
    "the continuum - emission coefficient @xmath64 , measured in erg sec@xmath24 @xmath58 hz@xmath24 ster@xmath24 , is related to @xmath49 through @xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ fig : continuum ] shows @xmath64 normalized to @xmath66 , i.e. , the he  i recombination contribution has been multiplied by the factor @xmath67 , so that the contributions of the three processes to the continuum can be directly compared .",
    "the specific intensity emitted through each process depends on the width of the filter s passband rectw : @xmath68 .",
    "the continuum contribution is very important in filters centered on weak lines , such as [ o  iii ] @xmath4 , but it barely affects the intensity in filters centered on strong lines , such as h@xmath7 or [ o  iii ] @xmath3 .",
    "our computations show that , at @xmath53 k and neglecting ly@xmath7 conversion , the continuum yields 40@xmath69 of the total intensity in the f437n filter around [ o  iii ] @xmath4 , 0.3@xmath69 of the total intensity in the f502n filter around [ o  iii ] @xmath3 , and 0.5@xmath69 of the total intensity in the f656n filter centered on h@xmath7 . as anticipated before , we also measured the continuum contribution on long - slit spectra , and compared it to our theoretical computations .",
    "our findings are discussed in next section .",
    "the expected continuum intensity can be compared to direct measurements of the continuum level in an optical spectrum .",
    "we followed this procedure measuring ( through the corresponding filter responses , as described in section  [ sec : linecon ] ) the integrated continuum flux and relevant line intensities in the two long - slit spectra of ngc 6543 described in section  [ sec : intdata ] . by means of this procedure , we find that the continuum contributes 58@xmath69 of the total intensity in the f437n filter around [ o  iii ] @xmath4 ( cf . figure  [ fig : spec ] ) , significantly more than expected on the basis of our previous calculations .",
    "three likely candidate mechanisms that would enhance the continuum level are x - ray emission , dust scattering , and 2-photon emission .",
    "x - ray diffuse emission has been recently reported from high resolution spectral images by chandra @xcite ; this is produced in the mass - loading shocked region where the fast stellar wind interacts with the inner gaseous shell .",
    "the optical tail of such emission could be the origin of the observed extra continuum . to test this point , we modeled the central cavity of ngc 6543 by means of simple , spherical hot - plasma models at different temperatures , normalized to the soft x - ray flux observed by chandra , and computed for each model the contribution to the f437n band .",
    "large uncertainties in this calculation are introduced by the values assumed for the plasma temperature , the exact lower energy limit seen by chandra ( which is around 0.1  0.2 kev ) , and the intervening absorption by neutral gas ( which we did not take into account in our estimates ) .",
    "for example , a @xmath70 k plasma , normalized to the emission in the ( 0.1  10 kev ) interval , produces only 0.001% of the observed extra - continuum in f437n , while a @xmath71 k plasma , normalized to the emission in the ( 0.4  10 kev ) interval , produces 10% of the observed extra - continuum in f437n .",
    "although these are only back - of - the - envelope computations , altogether they suggest that the extra continuum can not be explained in terms of hot plasma emission .    a different mechanism that could explain the extra continuum is dust scattering of the central star s radiation .",
    "even if the external screen extinction is rather small , @xmath72 ( see below ) , a cursory inspection of sws+lws archival spectra of ngc 6543 shows a thermal bump due to hot dust peaking at @xmath73 .",
    "although this mechanism is a plausible candidate for the origin of the extra continuum , the detailed modeling of the internal dust distribution in ngc 6543 is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a third possibility is 2-photon emission with enhanced efficiency . as discussed in section  [ sec : cont_theo ] , in our estimate of the 2-photon emissivity we made use of a simplified treatment @xcite , which neglects ly@xmath7 conversion .",
    "the efficiency of ly@xmath7 conversion to produce 2-photon emission varies between 0 in optically thin or dusty nebulae ( all the ly@xmath7 photons either escape or are destroyed by dust ) and a maximum ( all the ly@xmath7 photons are eventually converted to 2-photon emission ) .",
    "the detailed calculation of the actual efficiency of this process is virtually impossible , since it would require knowledge of the local escape probabilities and the dust structure of the nebula , and the implementation of this information in a 3-d computation .",
    "the only feasible alternative is to bracket this process by computing the 2-photon emission in the extreme case of maximum efficiency .",
    "following the formalism of @xcite , it is found that the 2-photon emission at @xmath4 can be enhanced by ly@xmath7 destruction by up to a factor of 3.5 , rising the total continuum by up to a factor of 2.5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : conthgamma ] compares the observational data to the continuum range predicted by recombination theory , as a function of the h@xmath40 intensity .",
    "the data are compatible with a ly@xmath7-conversion enhancement of the 2-photon continuum , and suggests that it is not necessary to invoke other processes to explain the measured continuum level ( the only discrepant points are some of those with the lowest intensity values , i.e. with the largest errors ) .",
    "the figure also shows that the relation between h@xmath40 and the measured continuum is not linear , and that there are large fluctuations around the best - fit straight line , as expected if the continuum in excess of the minimum level arises from ly@xmath7 conversion : stated otherwise , the ly@xmath7 conversion process acts with different efficiency across the nebula .",
    "this figure demonstrates that it is not possible to rely on theoretical calculations alone to correct the total flux in each image for the continuum contribution : first because we would ignore , a priori , the average efficiency of the ly@xmath7 conversion process ( the slope on the h@xmath40-continuum relation , which is provided by the slit spectrum ) ; second because , even with this piece of information available , we would still ignore the large fluctuations of the continuum around such average level .",
    "these fluctations naturally arise as a consequence of the local character of the 2-photon enhancement process , and , since theory alone provides no way of predicting where and how large they are across the image , they would translate directly into an uncertainty in the measured @xmath74 flux .",
    "furthermore , this uncertainty would be relatively much larger for @xmath74 than it is for the continuum , since the relative contribution of the line in the f437n filter is less than one half that of the continuum , so that a typical uncertainty of , e.g. , 20% in the continuum would translate into an uncertainty of 45% in the line .",
    "this would be much larger than the typical uncertainty that can be read directly from figure  [ fig : spec ] , and it would not avoid the need for a spectroscopic measurement ; so this strategy to determine @xmath75 across the image is definitely not viable .",
    "note also that this conclusion holds even under the hypothesis in which the 2-photon continuum is at its minimum level ( the only case that would allow to predict the continuum produced by recombination by means of a recombination line ) and that the additional continuum flux comes instead from a different source : as a matter of fact , the continuum is not proportional to h@xmath40 , hence it can not be predicted theoretically , no matter which process is responsible for the departure from direct proportionality .",
    "an important consequence is that no temperature maps can be obtained using this kind of data , unless very specific circumstances occur : one would be that @xmath4 dominate the light in the filter , so that only a rough correction for the continuum would suffice ; a second one would be the availability of tunable filters to measure directly the continuum level near @xmath4 , bypassing the need for theoretical predictions .",
    "the lesson to be learned from these computations is that precision photometry of weak lines can not be done with the hst / wfpc2 in the absence of data specifically designed to measure the continuum . as a matter of fact",
    ", an additional uncertainty is introduced even by the estimation of the contribution of the various lines inside each filter , unless a reliable calibration is available .",
    "both these problems and possible solutions to them - continuum and line subtraction - have been addressed by @xcite and @xcite ; their arguments will be described in section  [ sec : cont_f437n ] . to proceed with the discussion",
    ", we will therefore assume that the @xmath4 percentage within the filter f437n is the one provided by the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] , i.e. @xmath76/@xmath77f437n@xmath78 .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , that in the absence of slit spectra or sophisticated theoretical tools to estimate a priori the continuum intensity , such uncertainty would be much larger , amounting to the difference between the minimum and maximum continuum value admitted by recombination theory .    in their paper on ngc 6543 , @xcite pointed out inconsistencies between the theoretical estimation and the continuum level derived from observations ( in their case , ground - based echelle spectra ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether such inconsistencies can be tracked down to what we point out in this work , as their procedure differs from ours in at least two relevant aspects : first , the theoretical continuum flux computed by @xcite includes only the contributions by h  i recombination and bremsstrahlung . however , fig .",
    "1 in @xcite shows that , at @xmath60 k , the continuum is dominated by 2-photon continuum at @xmath4 , and this process is only slightly less important than h  i recombination at @xmath3 . at @xmath53",
    "k the 2-photon contribution is even more important .",
    "the 2-photon continuum must therefore be included even in a rough estimation of the theoretical continuum flux .",
    "second , @xcite adopt smaller values than we did for the width of the filter : 25.2  , 26.9  , and 21.9 for f437n , f502n , and f656n respectively , instead of 31.829  , 35.781  , and 28.336  .",
    "apparently , these values correspond to the effective width of the bandpass @xmath79 defined by @xcite ( pag . 149 and appendix 1 ; see also section  [ sec : width ] above ) ; however , we might be misunderstanding their procedure , since this point is not explicitly stated in their paper , and their h@xmath7 width slightly differs from the one given by @xcite .",
    "but if we are understanding their procedure , then the difference in the adopted filter widths propagates directly into differences in the estimated continuum flux .",
    "this introduces a large bias in all the derived fluxes .",
    "furthermore , since the ratios of different rectw values are not equal to the ratios of different @xmath79s , the intensity ratios of different images are correspondingly affected ( the way it affects the derived @xmath4 is more subtle , because the continuum contribution to be subtracted from the f437n flux is directly proportional to the adopted bandwidth ) .",
    "it seems probable that @xcite also relied on a theoretical computation to estimate the theoretical continuum in the f437n image , since the number they quote , @xmath80f437n@xmath81h@xmath14 ) , is comparable ( actually , smaller ) than our theoretical computation .",
    "however , their work is just a short conference contribution , and they do not specify how such estimate is obtained .",
    "a similar procedure was also followed by @xcite in their analysis of the planetary nebula ngc 7009 .",
    "these authors obtain a temperature map of ngc 7009 by means of wfpc2 images taken in the same filters considered by us . to estimate the line contribution inside the wfpc2 filters , they make use of hst / stis data , modified to take into account the transmittance of the corresponding wfpc2 filters .",
    "following this procedure , they find that the continua measured from stis are higher than expected at the temperature of the nebula .",
    "they interpret such discrepancies as an artefact due to insufficient signal - to - noise in the stis data , and therefore adopt in their analysis a continuum flux from theoretical computations ; it is possible , however , that the problem they found with the continuum in ngc 7009 is analogous to what is found in ngc 6543 , namely 2-photon continuum enhancement . in any case",
    ", the uncertainty on the continuum is less crucial in their work than it is in the case of ngc  6543 , because @xmath4 is relatively more intense in ngc 7009 : they measure in f437n a @xmath4/continuum ratio equal to 3.7 , i.e. almost one order of magnitude higher than the one observed in ngc  6543 .    summarizing this section on continuum ,",
    "it is important to stress that there is no safe way to predict accurately the @xmath4 contribution to the total flux in the filter f437n , unless this line is very bright . because of this difficulty",
    ", special care should be given to this point , and the relevant assumptions should always be made explicit .",
    "the mean value of the h@xmath7/h@xmath14 flux ratio across the hst image of ngc 6543 , with the [ n  ii ] and the continuum contributions subtracted , is h@xmath7/h@xmath14=3.06@xmath820.12 ( cf . figure  [ fig : haoverhb ] ) . adopting the extinction law by @xcite with @xmath83=3.0 , and fitting to the theoretical balmer decrement at @xmath53 k @xcite ,",
    "a reddening coefficient @xmath84 is obtained .",
    "the three @xmath85 values compiled by @xcite , @xmath85=0.18 , 0.20 and 0.30 , are significantly higher than our result .",
    "we ignore the origin of this discrepancy , since none of the papers referenced by @xcite lists the observed h@xmath7 fluxes , nor do they provide details on the assumptions underlying the computation of @xmath85 . on the other hand",
    ", our adopted @xmath85 agrees with the value determined by other authors .",
    "for example , @xcite found @xmath85=0.10 , and the average value from the literature compilation by @xcite is @xmath86 .",
    "the line intensities obtained by the measured fluxes after dereddening and empirically correcting for continuum contribution , are :    @xmath87    and    @xmath88    the quoted uncertainties have been estimated as follows : the uncertainty on @xmath89h@xmath90 , 0.06 dex , translates into uncertainties of 0.07 dex and 0.06 dex for @xmath4 and @xmath3 respectively ; the continuum subtraction adds another 0.05 dex to the uncertainty on @xmath76 ( section  [ sec : cont_obs ] ) ; finally , further uncertainties should be added to account for the shift in wavelength of the bandpass with temperature , and the photometric errors ( cf . * ? ? ? * table 8.11 ) ; however , this is a very complex issue , as it will be shown in section  [ sec : hstcalib ] , and this source of uncertainty will not be considered for the moment .",
    "these values yield @xmath3/@xmath4 = 490@xmath82130 , and @xmath8o@xmath91 k , a temperature lower than previously published values .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath92 k , @xcite find @xmath93 k , @xcite find @xmath94 k , and dlw adopt @xmath3/@xmath4 = 363 from @xcite , which yields , using the same atomic data as us , @xmath8o@xmath9=7900 k.    combining the infrared intensities measured on iso spectra with the [ o  iii ] @xmath3 intensity derived from the hst data , it is possible to simultaneously derive the temperature and density in the o@xmath0 zone of ngc 6543 by means of the infrared - line diagnostic described by dlw .",
    "the diagnostic diagram is shown in figure [ fig : oiii ] , where the point representing the data has been plotted .",
    "the data points by dlw and dhew are also plotted .",
    "the values obtained are @xmath95 @xmath58 , @xmath96 k , while the corresponding values quoted by dlw and dhew are @xmath2= @xmath97 @xmath58 , @xmath98 k and @xmath2= @xmath99 @xmath58 , @xmath100 k respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : oiii ] and table  [ tab : comparison ] show that the point by dlw and the one we obtain here disagree by much more than @xmath101 , both in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the three lines are discrepant , particularly @xmath5 and @xmath3 ( however , the discrepancy in @xmath3 depends solely on the adopted @xmath89h@xmath90 , since the difference between the measured fluxes is less than 1% ) . these differences go in the same sense , so that the @xmath102 ratio is not very different in the two cases : however , the upward bending of the isotemperature contours in the high - density region of the diagram enhances the difference between the corresponding temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with those by dhew , though unfortunately the fluxes of individual lines can not be compared since they were not published .      in the presence of temperature variations across a low - density , homogeneous nebula",
    ", it is well known that @xmath8o@xmath9 preferentially weighs regions of high @xmath1 , while @xmath8o@xmath10 preferentially weighs regions of lower @xmath1 .",
    "in such a case @xmath8o@xmath103o@xmath10 , with the equality holding in the constant - temperature case .",
    "when density fluctuations are also present , this basic scenario complicates , because the temperature is lower in the densest zones , and because collisional de - excitations of the infrared lines may play a role .",
    "roughly , we expect higher @xmath8o@xmath10 values due to the collisional suppression of the 52 @xmath12 line ; as a result , [ @xmath8o@xmath9  @xmath8o@xmath10 ] may become negative . since density fluctuations are certainly present in the nebula , as revealed by the filaments and thin shells seen in the h@xmath7 images of the nebula , the value we determined for @xmath8o@xmath10 is totally plausible .",
    "summing up , our @xmath8o@xmath9 does only marginally agree with the published values ; @xmath8o@xmath10 agrees with the most recent of the only two determinations we know of ; and @xmath8o@xmath10 compares well with the expected value of @xmath8o@xmath9 ( higher than ours by @xmath105 400  800 k ) , provided there are high density zones in the nebula , which depress the flux in @xmath5 . in the following , we will list and discuss the uncertainties affecting our results . in this discussion",
    "we will consider several uncertainties affecting all the data , although , in the light of the preceding discussion and the previous comparison to published data ( see section  [ sec : nt_ir ] ) , it seems probable that the problem lies with the adopted wfpc2 @xmath4 flux , and that our iso infrared data and the wfpc2 @xmath3 data are reasonably accurate .",
    "the long slit on which the continuum level was measured samples only one fraction of the whole nebula , and we can not guarantee that such fraction is indeed representative of the rest .",
    "it seems not probable , however , that the continuum varies so dramatically in the area outside the slit , so as to alter sensibly our conclusion .",
    "a further possibility is a bias in the continuum level of the slit spectra .",
    "a bias in the continuum level could be caused by at least two different circumstances : an inaccurate correction for light dispersion inside the spectrograph , and scattered light from the central star within the nebula .",
    "the first effect could be important in view of the fact that the flux in the continuum outweighs the flux in @xmath4 in the filter , so that a small bias in the continuum would be amplified in the derived @xmath4 value .",
    "the second effect , which would mimic a more intense nebular continuum , would affect equally the slit spectra and the hst images , so it can not be invoked as a cause for the low @xmath8o@xmath9 found , and will not be further discussed .",
    "@xcite stress the importance of an accurate calibration of the wfpc2 filters in order to make a quantitative use of the hst emission - line images .",
    "one of the problems they discuss related to calibration is that the filter characteristics described in the wfpc2 handbook have been determined in parallel light , whereas the incident beam inside the wfpc2 is convergent .",
    "the consequence is that the filters _ as used by the wfpc2 _ have shorter peak transmissions and wider fwhms .",
    "the use of the pre - launch filters characteristics provided with the hst documentation can therefore introduce a bias , and they recommend instead the use of calibration relations based on the instrument `` as used '' . a specific problem they address",
    "is the continuum subtraction ; the strategy they suggest to determine the continuum level is to use an image taken in f547 m , a filter that includes no prominent emission lines , together with an assumption on the color of the continuum .",
    "unfortunately , ngc  6543 has not been observed in this filter , so this method is not applicable in our case .",
    "a different strategy to subtract the continuum from the f437n filter has been proposed by @xcite for the case of low - excitation objects .",
    "the basic idea is to take an image in the f469n filter : the constraint on the excitation degree of the object ensures that the contribution of the he  ii line @xmath106 is negligible , and all the signal in the image can be interpreted in terms of continuum .",
    "this procedure allows to reduce the uncertainty related to the assumption on the color of the continuum , since the distance between the wavelengths of f437n and f469n is quite small .",
    "unfortunately , although the he@xmath0/h@xmath107 ratio in ngc 6543 is very small and make this object suitable to apply the method by @xcite , no f469n image of this object has been obtained ( maybe it is precisely _ because _ the he@xmath0/h@xmath107 ratio in ngc 6543 is so small , that an observation of the nebula with this filter was judged uninteresting by past observers ) .",
    "there are further possible explanations for our anomalous @xmath8o@xmath9 result related to the wfpc2 calibration",
    ". we will give a broad overview of them , without estimating them quantitatively .",
    "one problem is the accuracy in the determination of the contribution of the various lines in each filter . due to the nature of the calibration procedure mentioned in the previous section , together with the natural changes suffered by any filter with time",
    ", the specifications reported in the wfpc2 handbook do not necessarily give an accurate description of the actual filters transmission curves .",
    "as a result , the decontamination of the f656n flux from the [ n  ii ] @xmath30 contribution could be slightly biased ; and the decontamination of the f437n flux from the h@xmath40 contribution could be even more biased .",
    "unfortunately , the relations provided by @xcite to deal with this problem are not applicable , because they make use of the flux in the f547 m filter , which has not been used to observe ngc 6543 .",
    "there are also other potential problems that affect only faint images with very low dns .",
    "the composite f437n image used in the study has a mean dn of 2.9 , corresponding on average to @xmath108 in each of the two exposures ( the dn can not be measured individually on these two images , since it is spuriously increased by cosmic rays , which are removed in the composite image ) ; since these dns are extremely low , the effects mentioned in the following are possibly a large source of uncertainty in the f437n flux . on the other hand , the images taken with the other filters have dns of the order of hundreds , and their calibration is much more accurate .",
    "further relevant sources of uncertainty , which affect all ccds at low dns , are the read noise and the loss of information implied by the digitization of the signal .",
    "another important source of uncertainty in our specific case is the progressive alteration in the performance of the wfpc2 ccds : in orbit , the ccds are subject to radiation damage @xcite , which alters their long term properties leading to an increase in dark counts and a decrease in the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) .",
    "dark counts increase because of hot pixels , which are routinely identified and can , in principle , be corrected .",
    "conversely , the decrease in cte is difficult to estimate , since the existing calibrations @xcite are based on measurements of the cte loss for a bright point source ( @xmath109 for gain = 7 ) observed against a faint background ( @xmath110 for gain = 7 ) ; therefore , it is not clear whether the correction formulae provided by @xcite can be equally applied to the case of a diffuse , nebular object , which can be seen as a moderately faint object seen against a moderately faint background ( in our case , dn = @xmath111 for gain = 7 ) .",
    "on the other hand , figure 4.14 in @xcite , based on recent observations , includes a few more points for brighter backgrounds , in addition to those on which the calibration by @xcite was based .",
    "the behavior of the recently added points suggests that the cte does not depend on the dn for backgrounds of order @xmath112 1.4 dn ( equivalent to a dn = 2.8 at a gain of 7 ) .",
    "provided the cte behavior is smooth with respect to time , we can roughly estimate that the cte loss for the f437n filter was @xmath113  10% at the time our images were taken .",
    "as explained earlier , the uncertainty quoted on our adopted infrared line fluxes only represents the dispersion in our data sample .",
    "additional uncertainties might come from the calibration itself . according to @xcite , the uncertainty in the value of the flux for a line",
    "is given by the sum ( in quadrature ) of three terms : one of them is the dispersion in the measured line flux , and the other two are related to the detectors responsivity calibration .",
    "although these terms depend on the specific observation considered , typical values are @xmath114 and @xmath115 . adding them to the dispersion of our data points",
    ", we obtain an overall uncertainty of roughly 13% for either detector .",
    "it is possible , however , that this value still underestimates the real uncertainty .",
    "reasons for this are the following :    * both the drift of the sw2 detector with time and the difference between the sw1 and sw2 detectors are of the order of 10% of the measured flux .",
    "this uncertainty is not included in the previous estimation , and should be added to the overall error budget . *",
    "the spectrograph has been calibrated assuming that the source is point - like and centered on the optical axis . since our object violates at least the first of these assumptions , a correction to the flux",
    "should be done . as we stated before ,",
    "such correction is in principle very small ( of order @xmath105 1% ) .",
    "however , the beam profile of the instrument is not completely understood , being , e.g. , much narrower than predicted by optical theory for reasons still unknown @xcite ; so we can not completely exclude that the extension of the source do play a role in our analysis .",
    "* most density determinations of ngc 6543 are well in excess of our value @xmath57 @xmath58 ; for example , dlw found @xmath2[o  iii ] = 10000 @xmath58 and @xmath2[o  ii ] = 4000 @xmath58 , and @xcite found @xmath2[cl  iii ] = 4800 @xmath58 and @xmath2[ar  iv ] = 3900 @xmath58 ( but , on the other hand , dhew found @xmath2[o  iii ] = 2000 @xmath58 ) .",
    "higher density values would be obtained by increasing the flux of @xmath5 or decreasing the flux in @xmath6 , leading in both cases to lower @xmath8o@xmath10 .    as an illustrative example of the uncertainties affecting the iso / lws data",
    ", we repeated the computations adopting the mean @xmath5 flux of the sw1 detector instead of that of the sw2 detector .",
    "this different choice changes @xmath116 by -0.05 dex and @xmath117 by + 0.05 dex , yielding @xmath118 k and @xmath119 @xmath58 .",
    "as stated earlier in this paper , we derive a @xmath89h@xmath90 value much lower than some of the values found in the literature .",
    "however , we see no way of increasing our result .",
    "furthermore , even if this were the case , it would actually imply just a moderate improvement in the @xmath8o@xmath9 result . to illustrate quantitatively this point",
    ", we arbitrarily increased @xmath89h@xmath90 from 0.07 to 0.30 , the largest of the values compiled by @xcite .",
    "given the differential extinction affecting @xmath4 and @xmath3 , this change translates into a moderate decrease in the intrinsic @xmath120 ratio , implying an increase of less than @xmath121 k. on the other hand , such increase in @xmath89h@xmath90 would enormously affect the @xmath116 ratio , yielding an increase of as much as @xmath122 k.",
    "this work was motivated by the desire to determine self - consistently the physical conditions in the bright core of ngc 6543 .",
    "we did this by means of two different methods , both based on oxygen line ratios measured across the whole bright halo of the nebula .",
    "but , as the work progressed , it became evident that the archival data we used were not optimized for this particular task .",
    "the first method used is the standard nebular - to - auroral temperature diagnostic , and the second is the diagnostic diagram based on infrared lines developed by @xcite and dlw .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath1 values derived by means of the diagnostic diagram are not compatible with those by dlw , but are in very good agreement to the more recent result by dhew . on the other hand ,",
    "the nebular - to - auroral temperature we derive is somewhat lower than the values published in the literature .",
    "we discuss some possible causes for these results , related to the accuracy of hst , iso , and ground - based data .    as a sideproduct of this work",
    ", we find that the continuum level differs from the one expected at @xmath123o@xmath9 when ly@xmath7 conversion is neglected .",
    "we investigate the possibility that the extra continuum could arise from a high - temperature zone , possibly a shocked region , as suggested by the presence of x rays ; however , we could not reproduce the required extra continuum by means of simple plasma models of the x - ray emitting bubble .",
    "an alternative explanation we propose is that it is generated by dust scattering of the central star s light",
    ". a third possibility , which is the most plausible , is that the additional continuum is enhanced 2-photon emission , originated by conversion of scattered ly@xmath7 photons .    in neither case",
    "is it possible to work out a theoretical prescription to compute accurately the continuum intensity that would eliminate the necessity of relying on spectroscopic information .",
    "furthermore , either of these mechanisms would affect equally the slit spectra and the image , so neither would explain the marginally low temperature value that we deduce by means of the hst data . as a result ,",
    "the most important source of uncertainty in the determination of the optical temperature is the continuum subtraction in the @xmath4 image ; a specific conclusion we draw is that it is not possible with these data to obtain an accurate bidimensional temperature map of the nebula .",
    "more generally , we review several possible causes of error that could be introducing a bias in our work .",
    "the calibration uncertainty of wfpc2 at very low dns introduces perhaps an additional uncertainty .",
    "the hst fluxes at other wavebands and the iso data are probably more robust , but the overall uncertainty could still be somewhat higher than 10@xmath69 . in the case of hst data ,",
    "a fraction of this uncertainty might arise from the contribution of different lines to the observed fluxes ; in the case of iso data , the overall accuracy is probably of order @xmath105 13% .",
    "although ngc 6543 has been previously studied by many authors , most measurements have been made with small apertures which sample only a small fraction of the nebula .",
    "one disadvantage of this approach is that it limits the possibility to compare among different results . on the contrary , the data we use sample the whole region , allowing us to do a self - consistent analysis which eliminates the need of assumptions about the ionization structure .",
    "furthermore , the use of lines of the same ion allows a self - consistent determination of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , independent of assumptions on the ionization structure .",
    "unfortunately , the available archival data were not specifically designed for this analysis , and contain sources of uncertainties that are , in many cases , quite difficult to estimate .",
    "we think therefore that our results on the physical conditions in ngc 6543 are somewhat biased , and we definitely exclude the possibility of using these data to derive sensible temperature maps unless specifically designed data are obtained that provide a safe way of measuring the continuum and line contribution inside each filter .",
    "our results are , however , largely informative for what concerns delicate technical issues that must be taken into account when studies of this kind are carried out .",
    "in particular , we draw the attention , throughout this paper , to complex aspects of the use of data from large archives , in the hope that the authors of future similar works will be motivated to provide an explicit description of the crucial assumptions underlying their analyses .",
