    "the four dimensional space - time generated by a minimally coupled , spherically symmetric , static , massless scalar field has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "the general solution was found by m. wyman in @xcite . from a particular case of the general solution ,",
    "m. d. roberts showed how to construct a time dependent solution @xcite .",
    "this solution has an important physical interest because it may represent the gravitational collapse of a scalar field .",
    "later , p. brady and independently y. oshiro et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the roberts solution could be derived from the appropriated , time - dependent , einstein - scalar equations by using a continuous self - similarity .",
    "they also showed that this solution exhibits a critical behaviour qualitatively identical to the one found numerically by m. w. choptuik @xcite , studying the same system of equations .    using a discrete self - similarity of the system , choptuik explicitly showed that , the collapse results in two families of solutions depending on the value of a certain parameter @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 characterizes the scalar charge . in the first family , when @xmath8 , the scalar field collapses up to a certain surface and then disperses . in the other family ,",
    "when @xmath9 , the scalar field collapses to form a black hole .",
    "the critical value @xmath10 separates the two end states of the collapse .",
    "the critical solution ( @xmath11 ) represents a naked singularity .",
    "therefore , since it is given by a single value of the parameter , it has zero measure in the parameter space .",
    "in fact , the above results confirmed early studies of d. christodoulou who pioneered analytical studies of that model @xcite .",
    "the wyman s solution is not usually thought to be of great importance for the issue of gravitational collapse because it is static and the naked singularities derived from it are unstable against spherically symmetric linear pertubations of the system @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as we saw above , from a particular case of this solution one may derive the roberts one which is of great importance for the issue of gravitational collapse .",
    "also , it was shown that there are nakedly singular solutions to the static , massive scalar field equations which are stable against spherically symmetric linear pertubations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we think it is of great importance to gather as much information as we can about the wyman s solution for they may be helpful for a better understand of the scalar field collapse .    in the present work ,",
    "we would like to show that the wyman s solution may be obtained from the four - dimensional einstein s equations for a spherically symmetric , minimally coupled , massless scalar field by using the continuous self - similarity of those equations .",
    "the way by which we shall re - write the einstein - scalar equations in terms of a single variable is different from the one used in the derivation of the roberts solution in @xcite .",
    "we use a coordinate system with two null coordinates @xmath12 and the usual angular coordinates . due to the spherical symmetry all the functions appearing in the field equations",
    "must depend only on @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "our system is characterized by three functions : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , present in the metric and the scalar field @xmath17 . using the continuous self - similarity of the equations we re - write all functions in terms of a single variable @xmath18 , in the following way : @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an auxiliary function ; @xmath22 ; and @xmath23 . therefore , the difference between the way the authors in @xcite re - write the einstein - scalar equations in terms of a single variable and ours , is due to the @xmath15 and @xmath16 transformations .",
    "we believe that the above described way , may be sistematically used in other self - similar system of equations .",
    "after that , we find the differential equations for the variables @xmath16 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 and show that the wyman s solution , in the appropriate coordinates , satisfies them .",
    "the wyman s solution depends on two parameters , the mass @xmath0 and the scalar charge @xmath1 .",
    "as we have seen above , choptuik found a critical behaviour in the solutions to the einstein - scalar equations in terms of the parameter describing the scalar charge .",
    "therefore , one may try to find critical behaviour in wyman s solution by fixing @xmath0 and letting @xmath1 varies .",
    "we would like to show that , if one fixes @xmath0 to a positive value , say @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 take values along the real line , this solution exhibits critical behaviour .",
    "for @xmath4 the space - times have eternal naked singularities , for @xmath24 one has a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath2 and finally for @xmath6 one has eternal bouncing solutions . here",
    ", we can see that the critical solution is a schwarzschild black hole which interpolates between an infinity number of eternal naked singularities and bouncing space - times .",
    "although , this behaviour is very different from the one discovered by choptuik , one may have other types of critical solutions in the einstein - scalar system , as demontrated by p. brady in @xcite .    in the next section , section [ section : self - similarity ] ,",
    "we show that the wyman s solution may be obtained from the four - dimensional einstein s equations for a spherically symmetric , minimally coupled , massless scalar field by using the continuous self - similarity of those equations .    in section [ section : critical ] , we show that the wyman s solution exhibits critical behaviour",
    ". in particular , we numerically solve , with the appropriate boundary conditions , the equation for the radial function ( @xmath16 ) in terms of the radial coordinate ( @xmath25 ) and show how this function behaves for each type of solution : eternal naked singularities , eternal bouncing solutions and the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "finally , in section [ section : conclusion ] , we summarize the main points and results of the paper .",
    "we shall start by writing down the ansatz for the space - time metric . as we have mentioned before",
    ", we would like to determine the space - time generated by a spherically symmetric , minimally coupled , self - similar , collapse of a massless scalar field in four - dimensions .",
    "therefore , we shall write our metric ansatz as ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two arbitrary functions to be determined by the field equations , @xmath12 is a pair of null coordinates varying in the range @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the line element of the unit sphere .",
    "the scalar field @xmath17 will be a function only of the two null coordinates and the expression for its stress - energy tensor @xmath31 is given by @xcite ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 denotes partial differentiation .",
    "now , combining eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) we may obtain the einstein s equations which in the units of ref . @xcite and after re - scaling the scalar field ,",
    "so that it absorbs the appropriate numerical factor , take the following form ,    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    the equation of motion for the scalar field , in these coordinates , is    @xmath38    the above system of non - linear , second - order , coupled , partial differential equations ( [ 3])-([7 ] ) can be solved if we explore the fact that it is continuously self - similar .",
    "more precisely , the solution assumes the existence of an homothetic killing vector of the form ,    @xmath39    following coley @xcite , equation ( [ 8 ] ) characterizes a self - similarity of the first kind .",
    "we can express the solution in terms of the variable @xmath40 .    in order to obtain our solution",
    ", we shall re - write the above equations ( [ 3]-[7 ] ) in terms of @xmath41 , in a slightly different way than previous works @xcite .",
    "we shall write the unknown functions as : @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the system of equations ( [ 3]-[7 ] ) will have the mentioned self - similarity if we re - write @xmath45 in ( [ 1 ] ) in the following way ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is an arbitrary function of the null coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 and we must also write it as : @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that the main difference between our work and previous ones is in the way we re - write @xmath27 and @xmath28 as functions of @xmath41 .    in terms of @xmath41 and taking in account ( [ 9 ] ) , the system of equations ( [ 3]-[7 ] ) becomes ,    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51\\ ,   = \\ , -\\ z r ( \\dot{\\phi } ) ^2\\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath52    where @xmath53 means differentiation with respect to @xmath41 , @xmath54 and equations ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) reduce to equation ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the above system , equations ( [ 10]-[13 ] ) , can be greatly simplified if we re - write it in terms of the new variable @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting equations are ,    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    where the @xmath60 means differentiation with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "we solve the system of equations ( [ 14]-[17 ] ) by initially writing down a second order differential equation for @xmath16 in the following way .",
    "first of all , we subtract equation ( [ 15 ] ) from equation ( [ 16 ] ) and manipulate it in order to find ,    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is a real integration constant .",
    "then , we differentiate equation ( [ 14 ] ) once with respect to @xmath25 and introduce , in the differentiated equation , the value of @xmath63 from equation ( [ 14 ] ) and the information coming from equation ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "finally , we integrate the resulting equation to find ,    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a real integration constant . later",
    ", when we show that our solution is indeed the wyman s one , we shall identify the physical meaning of @xmath62 and @xmath65 .",
    "the equation for @xmath17 can be obtained if we eliminate @xmath66 and its derivatives from either one of the equations ( [ 15 ] ) or ( [ 16 ] ) , with the aid of equation ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "they give the same result , which is ,    @xmath67    it is easy to see that equation ( [ 17 ] ) also leads to the same result above .",
    "another way to write @xmath17 , which will be very important to our work , is derived from equation ( [ 20 ] ) with the aid of equation ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "after some algebra and an integration , we get ,    @xmath68    where we set the integration constant to @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , a solution to the system of equations ( [ 14]-[17 ] ) is computed by initially solving equation ( [ 19 ] )",
    ". then , for the function @xmath70 obtained , one uses equation ( [ 14 ] ) to find @xmath45 .",
    "finally , for the function @xmath70 obtained , one uses equation ( [ 20 ] ) to find the scalar field @xmath71 or equivalently for the value of @xmath72 obtained , one uses equation ( [ 21 ] ) to find @xmath71 .",
    "now , we would like to demonstrate that the wyman s solution is a solution to the system of equations ( [ 14]-[17 ] ) .",
    "as the first step in our demonstration , we apply the following coordinate transformations ,    @xmath73    from the definition of @xmath74 as @xmath75 , we immediately obtain from equation ( [ 22 ] ) that , @xmath76 . in terms of these new coordinates , the line element equation ( [ 1 ] )",
    "becomes ,    @xmath77    we may now compare it with the line element of the wyman s solution written in the doubel null coordinates ( u , v ) @xcite ,    @xmath78    where @xmath0 is the mass parameter , @xmath79 and @xmath1 is the scalar charge .",
    "the function @xmath80 may be written in terms of @xmath25 in the following way ,    @xmath81\\ ] ]    where @xmath82 is the gauss hypergeometric function and @xmath83 is an integration constant .",
    "this is a transcendental equation which can not be inverted , in general , to give us @xmath84 as an explicity function of @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , we shall consider @xmath84 as an implicity function of @xmath25 and use equation ( [ 25 ] ) to prove our thesis .    now , since @xmath16 and @xmath84 are functions of @xmath25 , we may directly compare the metric components in the line elements ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) to obtain ,    @xmath85    and @xmath86 therefore , from the wyman s solution we have an expression for @xmath16 , which must satisfies equation ( [ 19 ] ) and an expression for @xmath87 , which must satisfies equation ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "introducing the expression of @xmath16 in terms of @xmath84 ( [ 26 ] ) in equation ( [ 19 ] ) , we may prove , with the aid of equation ( [ 25 ] ) , that it satisfies equation ( [ 19 ] ) if , and only if , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . from now on",
    ", we shall assume that those are the correct values of the integration constants @xmath62 and @xmath65 .",
    "likewise , if we introduce the expressions of @xmath16 equation ( [ 26 ] ) and @xmath45 equation ( [ 27 ] ) in equation ( [ 14 ] ) , we may prove , with the aid of equation ( [ 25 ] ) , that this equation is satisfied .",
    "we complete our demonstration by using the value of @xmath90 equation ( [ 27 ] ) , in equation ( [ 21 ] ) to find ,    @xmath91    which is exactly the expression for the scalar field in the wyman s solution @xcite .",
    "so , the wyman s solution may be derived from the einstein - scalar equations ( [ 3]-[6 ] ) by using the continuous self - similarity of those equations in an appropriated way . as a matter of completeness we mention that , if we introduce a time coordinate @xmath92 defined by , @xmath93 , we may re - write the line element equation ( [ 1 ] ) , as ,    @xmath94",
    "depending on the value of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 the wyman s solution may represent different static , asymptotically flat space - times @xcite , @xcite .",
    "when one sets @xmath95 , the scalar field vanishes from equation ( [ 28 ] ) and one obtains the schwarzschild solution with a mass @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is usual to consider @xmath0 positive . for positive @xmath0 one may let @xmath3 take values over the real line . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the solution represents space - times with an eternal naked time - like singularity located at @xmath97 . from equation ( [ 28 ] ) , the scalar field vanishes asymptotically ( @xmath98 ) and diverges at the singularity . for @xmath99 ,",
    "one normaly considers the domain : @xmath100 because if @xmath101 from equation ( [ 24 ] ) the metric gets complex .",
    "the case @xmath102 is well know in the literature as the yilmaz - rosen space - time @xcite . observe that this restriction in the domain of @xmath3 , when this quantity is negative , comes from the use of the quantities @xmath103 equation ( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "when one considers the metric written in the original quantities in the wyman s papers @xcite or even in the quantities leadind to equation ( [ 23 ] ) , one sees that the domain of @xmath99 may be extended to : @xmath104 . in the present situation , since we are using the identifications ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) , we can see that our original quantities @xmath105 become ill defined for @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we shall consider here the domain of @xmath3 to be @xmath106 . in these space - times , @xmath16 is never zero .",
    "if one starts with a large value of @xmath16 it diminishes , as we let it varies as a function of @xmath25 , until it reaches a minimum value .",
    "then , it starts to increase again without limit .",
    "we may interpret this case as an eternal bouncing solution .",
    "an important property of this space - time is that the scalar field equation ( [ 28 ] ) is imaginary .",
    "the imaginary scalar field also known as ghost klein - gordon field @xcite is an example of the type of matter called _ exotic _ by some authors @xcite .",
    "it violates most of the energy conditions and is repulsive .",
    "this property helps explaing the reason why the collapsing scalar field bounces back without reaching @xmath97 .",
    "recently , the exotic matter has been in evidence due to the discovery that the universe is expanding in an accelerated rate @xcite .",
    "this implies that the universe must be filed with matter which violates at least the strong energy condition @xcite .",
    "this type of matter is also very much used as the matter responsible for the formation and maintenance of traversible wormholes @xcite , @xcite . in particular , the ghost klein - gordon field has been used as one of the first specific _ exotic _ matter models to explain the formation and maintenance of traversible wormholes @xcite . besides the above motivations for the use of _ exotic _ matter , which involve classical fields , one must not forget about negative energy densities very commom in quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "based on the above properties of the wyman s solution and taking in account the results of references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , on critical behaviour in the spherical symmetric , massless , scalar field collapse , we conclude that the wyman s solution also shows a critical behaviour .",
    "although the critical solution is of a different type from the one discovered in the above mentioned refences , one may proceed here in the same way as the authors there , in order to show the critical behaviour .",
    "one fixes the mass parameter @xmath0 and considers the scalar charge @xmath1 as the only free parameter . in the present case , as discussed above , we fix @xmath0 to a positive value , say @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 may take values in the domain , @xmath107 . for @xmath3 positive @xmath108",
    ", we have a set ( @xmath109 ) of solutions representing asymptotically flat , time - like , eternal naked singularities .",
    "consider , now , equation ( [ 19 ] ) , suitably written for the present situation as ,    @xmath110    we may numerically solve it using boundary conditions reflecting the asymptotic behaviour of the solution and the appropriate value of @xmath3 . with this numerical solution , we may draw the curve @xmath111 . following the above procedure ,",
    "we show in figure 1 the curve @xmath112 for two members of the set @xmath109 . for @xmath3 negative @xmath113",
    ", we have a set ( @xmath114 ) of solutions representing asymptotically flat , eternal bouncing space - times .",
    "figure 2 shows the curve @xmath115 for two members of the set @xmath114 , obtained from the numerical solutions of equation ( [ 30 ] ) with appropriate values of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , for @xmath116 , we obtain the critical solution which interpolates between the infinity number of solutions in the set @xmath109 and the ones in the set @xmath114 . for fix @xmath0",
    "this solution is a point in the parameter space of solutions and represents the schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath2 .",
    "we may solve equation ( [ 30 ] ) for the appropriate value of @xmath3 and draw the curve @xmath111 for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this curve is shown in figure 3 .",
