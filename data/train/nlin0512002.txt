    "experiments with cold atoms nowadays offer unique possibilities for the study of single particle motion and collective particle dynamics in tailored optical or magnetic potentials . the atomic centre - of - mass motion can be prepared and controlled with unprecedented precision , what allows experimentalists to realise and study many toy models of condensed matter physics @xcite . since in experiments with cold atomic gases noise and perturbations",
    "can be driven to a minimum , which often is indeed negligible , such setups offer a great advantage with respect to solid - state realisations .    in this paper , we discuss the possibility of observing sensitive quantum effects which manifest in a fractal variation of a transport function with respect to a well - tunable control parameter .",
    "similar fractal fluctuations of the transmission probability across solid - state samples have been measured recently @xcite in systems whose underlying classical phase space typically contains mixed regular - chaotic structures .",
    "most features of these experiments can be understood semiclassically as a consequence of the phase space topology @xcite .",
    "however , the precise origin of the observed fractal conductance fluctuations in these experiments is not yet fully understood @xcite , and , in fact , various theoretical models @xcite predict fractal conductance fluctuations for mesoscopic devices .",
    "our aim is to design a concrete experimental scenario in which parametric fractal fluctuations could be measured with high precision cold - atom setups . in such experiments the cross - over between mixed and completely chaotic classical dynamics",
    "can be scanned easily @xcite , and hence fractal transmission probabilities could be measured in a regime where classical or semiclassical arguments do not apply .    as was shown by guarneri and terraneo @xcite , fractal fluctuations in the transmission probability of a quantum scattering problem",
    "arise naturally as a consequence of the spectral properties of the system .",
    "the two essential conditions on the spectrum are ( i ) a power - law distribution of decay widths and ( ii ) uncorrelated real parts of the energy spectrum .",
    "moreover , various eigenstates have to contribute together to the decay , a fact which is expressed formally by requiring that ( iii ) the average decay width is much larger than the mean level spacing . based on these conditions ,",
    "the theory of @xcite explained the occurrence of quantum fractal fluctuations in the @xmath0-kicked rotor model in the deep quantum realm @xcite , where semiclassical arguments can not explain the occurrence of fractality .    in this paper",
    "we study a similar dynamical situation as in @xcite , yet with important modifications which fully account for the actual experimental realisation of the kicked rotor . using either cold or ultracold atomic gases",
    ", the kicked rotor is realised by preparing a cloud of atoms with a small spread of initial momenta , which is then subjected to a one - dimensional optical lattice potential , flashed periodically in time @xcite .",
    "let us call @xmath1 the wave number of the optical lattice , @xmath2 the flashing period ( `` kicking '' period ) , @xmath3 the momentum of the single atom , @xmath4 its centre - of - mass position , @xmath5 the maximum potential depth , and @xmath6 is the atomic mass .",
    "it is convenient to adopt rescaled units by noting that @xmath7 is the photon recoil momentum and @xmath8 is the recoil energy @xcite .",
    "so we define @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the kicking strength of the lattice is expressed by @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian now reads in dimensionless units @xcite @xmath13 owing to the @xmath0-interaction of the potential with the atoms , the time evolution operator between kicks can be explicitly written in a factorised form , extremely convenient for numeric simulations",
    ". the derivation of the one - period evolution operator exploits the spatial periodicity of the potential by bloch s theorem @xcite .",
    "this defines _",
    "quasimomentum _ @xmath14 as a constant of the motion , the value of which is the fractional part of the physical momentum @xmath15 in dimensionless units @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath14 is a conserved quantum number , @xmath15 can be labelled using its integer part @xmath17 only .",
    "the spatial coordinate is then substituted by @xmath18 and the momentum operator by @xmath19 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the one - kick propagation operator for a fixed quasimomentum @xmath14 is thus given by @xcite @xmath20    in close analogy to the transport problem across a solid - state sample , we follow @xcite to define the quantum survival probability as the fraction of the atomic ensemble which stays within a specified region of momenta while applying absorbing boundary conditions at the `` sample '' edges .",
    "if we call @xmath21 the wave function in momentum space and @xmath22 the edges of the system , absorbing boundary conditions are implemented by the prescription @xmath23 if @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "this truncation is carried out after _ each _ kick .",
    "this procedure mimics the escape of atoms out of the spatial region where the dynamics induced by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) takes place .",
    "if we denote by @xmath26 the projection operator on the interval @xmath27n_{1},n_{2}[$ ] the survival probability after @xmath28 kicks is : @xmath29    we will show in the following that signatures of fractality in the survival probability could be observed in modern atom - optical experiments , where the initial atomic ensemble has a finite , non - zero width in momentum space .",
    "in contrast to the work of @xcite , where the initial quasimomentum is scanned to arrive at the parametric observable @xmath30 , we investigate the behaviour of @xmath31 as a function of the best controllable parameter in the experiment , namely the time @xmath32 which elapses between two successive kicks @xcite .    after a brief review of the results of guarneri and",
    "terraneo @xcite applied to the dynamically localised kicked rotor ( section [ sec:2 ] ) , we discuss in section [ sec:3 ] our choices of the system parameters , which are guided by the experimental possibilities as well as the conditions stated in @xcite .",
    "our central results on the occurrence of fractal survival probabilities are presented for the limit of long - interaction times ( section [ sec:4 ] ) as well as for experimentally accessible initial momentum distribution and interaction times ( section [ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "section [ sec:6 ] finally concludes the paper .",
    "without a priori assumptions on the integrability or chaoticity properties of the classical analogue of the quantum system of interest , guarneri and terraneo @xcite showed that fractal conductance fluctuations occur if certain conditions on the quantum spectrum of the open system are fulfilled .",
    "the first condition , ( i ) a power - law distribution of the decay widths , is indeed present in the weakly opened quantum kicked rotor @xcite .",
    "we verified this by diagonalising the one - kick evolution operator @xmath33 , after representing it in the basis of momentum states .",
    "the matrix was cut at the positions @xmath34 and @xmath35 to mimic the required absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "if either of the two cutoffs ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) is chosen sufficiently large , the shape of the wavefunction in momentum space supports an exponential tail , independent of the evolution time ( after a short transit time @xmath36 at which dynamical localisation has fully developed @xcite ) .",
    "for such a situation in the localised regime , the probability density of decay widths was found to be @xmath37 over more than 10 orders of magnitude in @xmath38 , consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath34 and @xmath35 were decreased , dynamical localisation is gradually destroyed and the distribution deforms continuously , giving more weight to larger widths and less to the very small ones .",
    "such a deformation was observed in the analogous context of ionisation rates of microwave - driven hydrogen rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "our choice of @xmath34 and @xmath35 represents a compromise between the maximum width of typical experimental detection windows in momentum space and a guaranteed dynamically localised momentum distribution over a substantial interval of momenta . in the next section , we state the precise values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 which we investigated in this paper .    in the regime of strong dynamical localisation ,",
    "the quasienergy spectrum of the @xmath0-kicked rotor has a poisson - like statistics @xcite . under the same conditions as stated above on the cutoff values @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "this property of the real - parts of the quasienergy spectrum remains even when the system is opened @xcite .",
    "hence , also the second requirement for fractality of @xcite , that ( ii ) the energy spectrum consists of uncorrelated sequences , is fulfilled in good approximation for the opened @xmath0-kicked rotor in the presence of dynamical localisation .",
    "the third condition stated in @xcite is that the opening of the system is weak , but still sufficient to guarantee that ( iii ) the average decay width is much larger than the mean level spacing . for our choice of parameters and cutoff values @xmath34 and @xmath35 , also this condition of overlapping `` resonance peaks '' is fulfilled , as we verified numerically from the quasienergy spectrum of the truncated matrix representation of @xmath33 .    as exercised in @xcite ,",
    "the conditions ( i - iii ) are sufficient to guarantee self - affine fluctuations in the quantum survival probability , with a predicted fractal dimension @xmath39 which is related to the exponent of the width distribution @xmath40 by the following general formula @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "we repeat that parametric fractal fluctuations in the survival probability of dynamically localised kicked rotor have already been found in @xcite , before their origin could be explained in @xcite . in this work , however , we scan a different parameter than the one used in @xcite , which corresponded to quasimomentum . here",
    "we use the kicking period @xmath32 as control parameter , which can be much better controlled in state - of - the - art experiments @xcite than the initial value of momentum @xcite . on the other hand , the use of @xmath32 confronts us with a new problem which is discussed in the following section .",
    "for our analysis the value of the kicking strength @xmath43 was chosen in the range @xmath44 , or @xmath45 , going along with the transition from local to global chaos with increasing @xmath43 in this range @xcite . for our choice of kicking periods @xmath46 @xcite , classical trajectories wandering about hierarchical structures of the classical phase space will not have a quantum analogue because those structures are too small to be resolved by the wave function .",
    "this means that the observed fluctuations indeed arise from quantum localisation effects and not from a semiclassical diffusion process .      as reviewed in section [ sec:2 ] , the sufficient conditions for the occurrence of fractal fluctuations are fulfilled for choices of @xmath32 for which the @xmath0-kicked rotor exhibits dynamically localised behaviour . however , besides dynamical localisation the quantum @xmath0-kicked rotor supports `` quantum resonant '' motion for specific values of @xmath32 and quasimomentum @xmath14 @xcite . our goal is to avoid as much as possible the impact of the quantum resonances on the dynamics , such that we can clearly identify the origin of the fractality of the survival probabilities .",
    "since the parameter we scanned is the kicking period @xmath32 , we verified that no signatures of quantum resonances are found in the analysed small range of @xmath32 and for the applied , finite kick numbers .",
    "the quantum kicked rotor shows ballistic growth of momentum , shortly _ a quantum resonance _ , if @xmath47 and in these cases the time dependence of energy on the number of kicks is @xcite @xmath48 the denominator @xmath49 in the rational factor of @xmath32 is called the _ order _ of the resonance .",
    "the set containing all the resonances has zero lebesgue measure in any interval of kicking periods , but we do care about it because the dependence on @xmath32 of the survival probability @xmath50 is continuous for a fixed , finite number of kicks and the fluctuations we want to observe should be caused by dynamical localisation and not by quantum resonances .",
    "the preceding growth estimate ( [ eq : estimate ] ) establishes that a resonance is suppressed for a time that increases more than exponentially with its order .",
    "one way to avoid contributions from the resonances is to use a judicious choice of the range of @xmath32 and sampling grid @xmath51 used for numerical simulations or experiments .",
    "we chose @xmath52 where the value of @xmath53 is a fraction of the golden mean : @xmath54 for @xmath55 , also all other grid points in @xmath51 are incommensurable to @xmath56 up to the used significant digits .",
    "we verified that the lowest order resonance in the range @xmath57 \\approx [ 1.4,1.41]$ ] has @xmath58 and that there is no crowding of resonances of order @xmath59 anywhere in this interval .",
    "since we are not going to use times longer than @xmath60 kicks in our simulations , and kicking strength of order unity , the quadratic term is suppressed dramatically by the coefficient @xmath61 in ( [ eq : estimate ] ) , for all occurring resonances @xmath62 .",
    "finally , we explicitly checked throughout the simulations that localisation is at work by inspecting the average energy and , for selected values of @xmath32 , the shape of the wave function in momentum space , which shows a characteristic exponential decrease as explained below in section [ sec:3.3 ] .",
    "we also tried a quantitative approach for the choice of the grid along the @xmath32 axis .",
    "if some resonance were important , any numerical selection method could detect it and prefer grids with points away from the quantum resonances .",
    "our method is based on the maximisation in the `` grids space '' of a function @xmath63 that adds a contribution from each resonance , up to a maximum order , within a given interval , and this contribution is the larger the farther the resonance position in @xmath32 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : resonances ] ) ] is from the nearest point of the grid .",
    "this means that a `` higher mark '' is achieved by the grids whose points are away from the resonances .",
    "formally we defined @xmath64 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f(g(\\tau_{0 } , \\delta\\tau ) ) = \\sum _ { \\tau_{r } \\in s } f_{r } ( \\min \\{|\\tau_{r}-\\tau_{g}|;\\tau_{g } \\in g \\ } ) , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "of course , this programme requires detailed knowledge of the dynamics near the high - order resonances of @xmath62 , but this goal has not been theoretically accomplished yet .",
    "none of our weight functions could resolve the presence of a resonance by a sharp minimum when applied to a specific grid .    as a consequence of our choice of the interval of kicking periods and grid points in this interval ,",
    "no signatures of quantum resonances are expected to manifest for interaction times of up to @xmath60 kicks .",
    "the probability decay arises from the open geometry of our system , which is implemented mathematically by imposing absorbing boundary conditions in momentum space @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath67 the requirement on the boundaries is that they must guarantee dynamical localisation ( see section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "this happens if the wave function on the boundaries is `` so '' small that the kicking potential can not spread a `` substantial '' part of the wave function out of the boundaries .",
    "the compatibility of the values of the parameters involved ",
    "@xmath68  is checked using a consequence of the conditions that grant a fractional dimension of the graph of the survival probability ( see section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "this consequence is that the square of the wave function decreases with time _ keeping its shape constant _ , in the limited momentum lattice representing the open system .",
    "let us recall that the typical shape of a one - dimensional localised wave function is exponential , extending in a region intermediate between the support of the initial state in momentum space and the absorbing boundary . in a linear - logarithmic plot",
    "the wave function is ( apart from erratic fluctuations around its mean decrease ) a line in this intermediate region ; constancy of the shape means constancy of the steepness of the line .",
    "this criterion , which is in fact a localisation criterion , was used as a prerequisite for all our simulations .",
    "if the boundaries are too far away from the initial state , the decay is extremely slow ( a consequence of strong dynamical localisation ) . to avoid long waiting times ( which are hard to reach experimentally ) ,",
    "asymmetric boundaries have been used , with @xmath69 , and a statistical initial ensemble of orbits at @xmath70 with @xmath71 and randomly distributed phases @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 . the wave function in momentum space",
    "@xmath74 then evolves to a shape which is asymmetric with respect to @xmath75 . on the side where the cutoff is closer to the origin",
    ", the wave function does not decrease exponentially , and in a linear - logarithmic plot the momentum distribution shows a broad and smooth maximum , while at @xmath75 a sharp peak would be present if we choose @xmath76 . although the exponential decrease on the side of the larger cutoff @xmath35 is influenced by the opening at @xmath34 , the shape indeed remains constant for a sufficiently large number of kicks in a range @xmath77 , where the precise value of @xmath78 depends on the choice of @xmath34 .     for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and different kick numbers @xmath28 .",

    "is chosen , fractality is expected to increase as @xmath28 increases due to the appearance of fluctuations on finer and finer scales .",
    "a finer grid requires a longer time to yield a `` fractal graph '' down to finer scales , because it takes longer for the fluctuations to appear on a scale smaller than the grid resolution .",
    "this scenario , where fractality is generated by `` dynamical intrusion '' , is exemplified in figure [ fig:1 ] where the survival probability in the localised regime is shown after various interaction times .",

    "the visible avoided crossings are a consequence of quantum chaotic dynamics and their ubiquitous presence on different scales in @xmath32 naturally compares to the self - affine fluctuations of the survival probability .",
    "this comparison highlights the fact that the observed fractality is indeed a consequence of quantum chaos .    the box - counting plot in figure [ fig:3 ] ( a ) shows the number of adjacent squares @xmath101 of width @xmath0 along the @xmath32 axis necessary to box all points of the curve from figure [ fig:2 ] ( a ) . the scaling law @xmath102 thus determines the fractal dimension @xmath39 .",

    ", table 1 tells us that a variation of @xmath43 of the order up to @xmath171 is not crucial .",
    "time is one of the best controlled experimental parameters , and this feature makes it an ideal candidate for implementing an experiment to search for fractal fluctuations .",
    "kicking periods between about hundred nanoseconds and a few hundred microseconds are available , with a maximal precision of a few nanoseconds @xcite . for caesium atoms",
    ", this range corresponds to dimensionless kicking periods ( see section [ sec:1 ] ) @xmath172 , and a maximal precision of @xmath173 .",
    "this precision implies that about 100 points could be scanned in our analysed interval in @xmath32 , which would be sufficient for a rough , qualitative verification of our predictions .",
    "any experiment will have a finite detection window of observable momentum classes .",
    "the actual width of this window is typically determined by the imaging resolution and by the minimal signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement device @xcite .",
    "the detection window also determines a maximum interaction time after which the detection of a constantly decreasing atomic ensemble ( due to the open boundary conditions ) becomes meaningless . in other words ,",
    "the maximum number of kicks is limited by the precision disposable in the determination of the final momentum distribution .",
    "correspondingly , in our results reported below we choose the minimal kicking strength @xmath139 where the fractal dimension starts to saturate ( see section [ sec:4 ] ) and a maximum interaction time of @xmath146 kicks .",
    "the latter implies that we can choose a wider grid in @xmath32 because very fine structures do not develop for interaction times @xmath174 .",
    "we used @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 [ c.f .",
    "( [ eq : irrational ] ) ]",
    ". a problem will certainly be the realisation of our idealised absorbing boundary conditions at specific momentum classes of the atoms . here",
    "methods using , for instance , external cutting potentials  such as so called radio - frequency knives @xcite or equally operating additional lasers  could be thought of .      to approach real experimental scenarios , we shall analyse the survival probability for a smaller number of kicks of order @xmath163 @xcite and take into account an initial spread of quasimomentum among the ensemble of cold atoms @xcite .    for a typical ensemble of cold atoms ,",
    "the momentum distribution is gaussian - like , with a width exceeding that of the brillouin zone @xmath178 , equal to @xmath179 in our dimensionless units @xcite .",
    "folding produces approximately a uniform distribution in the entire brillouin zone , i.e. , a uniform distribution of quasimomenta with a width of @xmath180 @xcite . using atoms in the bose - einstein condensate phase as initial ensemble allows the experimentalist a much better control over the width of the quasimomentum distribution @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath181 have been realised in this context @xcite .",
    "letting the condensate expand a little before the actual kicking evolution , allows one to reduce the atom - atom interactions to negligible values , with only slight changes in @xmath182 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the survival probability , experimentally measured by counting the number of atoms contained within the finite detection window , would be the result of an average of many _ independent _ survival probabilities with different values of quasimomentum .",
    "the independence of probabilities follows from the independent dynamics of the atoms @xcite , while the coherent evolution of a single atoms is still essential for the observed behaviour .",
    "we computed @xmath183 for different ranges of @xmath14 , and then averaged the resulting curves to arrive at @xmath184 .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] investigates the effect of averaging over @xmath14 on the fractal dimension .",
    "the survival probabilities for two fixed @xmath14 are shown , together with the average for a uniform distribution of @xmath147 values of @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] ( a ) shows that the average curve is quite smooth on large scales , but nevertheless presents fluctuations on finer resolutions , with a fractal dimension substantially larger than unity .",
    "we verified that , by decreasing the number of atoms in the ensemble , the dimension steadily increases .",
    "we encounter a signature of fractality , which experiments could detect even far from the idealised limit of the one - atom dynamics .",
    "that is , the fluctuating behaviours of the averaged curves is a direct consequence of fluctuations of single @xmath14 curves .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the average survival probability for ensembles with the same number of @xmath14 values but with different , larger widths @xmath182 of the initial quasimomentum distribution .",
    "wider distributions are smoother on large scales and are not drawn in figure [ fig:5 ] ( a ) because they could not be appreciated by eye when compared to curves for @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the magnification in ( b ) shows that the fluctuations exhibit smaller excursions . a fractal analysis",
    "[ see figure [ fig:5 ] ( c ) ] by the variational method shows that the dimension @xmath39 remains in all cases larger than unity and , moreover , does _ not _ vary monotonically as @xmath182 is increased .",
    "we interprete our results for finite @xmath182 in the following way : while a small range @xmath182 tends to wash out the fractal behaviour of the curves with one fixed @xmath14 , an average over larger ranges @xmath182 tends to lift the fractal dimension again .",
    "this line follows nicely from the prediction of @xcite where it is argued that fractality can arise from superimposing non - fractal patterns on appropriate scales of the scanned variable @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] repeats the analysis of figure [ fig:5 ] for @xmath187 ( a , b ) and @xmath188 ( c , d ) .",
    "the fractal dimension of each average survival probability for a definite value of @xmath182 is seen to be a monotonic function of time , what points out once more the dynamical origin of the analysed fluctuations .",
    "this contrasts the dependence of the fractal dimension on @xmath182 at fixed time , which is non monotonic , because averaging both washes out the fluctuations of the single curves for small @xmath189 , while it creates new ones by superimposition for @xmath190 .    from a more general perspective",
    ", the survival probability @xmath191 can be seen as a surface lying over the plane spanned by the two variables @xmath32 and @xmath14 . in @xcite @xmath191",
    "was analysed at fixed @xmath32 using @xmath14 as scanning parameter , i.e. , a slice of the surface parallel to the @xmath14 axis was analysed . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we studied the `` orthogonal '' problem of fixed @xmath14 , using @xmath32 as a scanning variable .",
    "averaging over @xmath14 can be interpreted as a `` column density '' , i.e. , @xmath191 integrated over the @xmath14 degree of freedom .",
    "the resulting averaged curve is the observable experimentally accessible as discussed in this section .",
    "looking at figure [ fig:7 ] , our results can thus be interpreted geometrically : the fractal behaviour of the slices @xmath192 is to a large extent preserved by the average over a typical experimental spread in @xmath14 .     and @xmath32 is shown after @xmath146 kicks , for @xmath139 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "slices of the graph @xmath191 are shown on the right panel .",
    "the thick lines represent the survival probability as a function of @xmath32 that is analysed in section [ sec:4 ] ( we have used @xmath147 similar curves to compute the incoherent average which is the experimental observable , as explained in section [ sec:5.2 ] ) .",
    "the thin curve lying in the plane orthogonal to the @xmath32 axis is the survival probability @xmath30 as a function of the quasimomentum @xmath14 such as studied in @xcite .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=245 ]",
    "we considered the quantum kicked rotor , a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos , which describes the time evolution of noninteracting cold atoms in periodically flashed optical lattices .",
    "imposing absorbing boundary conditions allows one to probe the transport properties of the system , and in particular to define the survival probability of atoms on a finite region in momentum space . for fixed kick numbers ,",
    "the quantum survival probability depends sensitively on the parameters of the system , and a self - affine structure of the survival probability @xmath193 is predicted , as either the kicking period or quasimomentum is scanned .",
    "instead of using the initial quasimomentum @xmath14 as control parameter , as done in the numerical simulations of @xcite , we used the kicking period @xmath32 as scan parameter , which is much better controllable experimentally .",
    "we verified the fractal nature of the graph of the survival probability @xmath31 in the dynamically localised regime , and obtained a fractal dimension @xmath194 for large but finite interaction times , for which quantum resonances do not manifest .",
    "any experimental setup prepares cold atoms with a finite spread in quasimomentum .",
    "the experimental observable is then the average of the survival probabilities over the quasimomentum distribution .",
    "we reproduced this observable by computing the incoherent average @xmath195 , and found that the fractal dimension of the average remains substantially larger than unity , even for shorter interaction times of a few hundred kicks .",
    "we conclude that the fractality in the survival probability induced by quantum chaos is an unexpectedly robust feature and in spite of many challenging aspects ( see section [ sec:5 ] ) could be observed in a future atom - optics experiment .",
    "apart from the experimental verification of fractal fluctuations of purely quantum origin , a remaining open problem is whether a universal scaling law for the fractal dimension could be found as a function of _ both _",
    "parameters @xmath32 and @xmath14 , including quantitative predictions for the here computed averages @xmath196 over a finite range of @xmath14 .",
