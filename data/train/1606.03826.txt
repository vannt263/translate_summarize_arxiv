    "the theory of _ operads _ is a convenient framework for organizing a variety of algebraic structures , such as associative and commutative algebras , or more interestingly algebras which are associative or commutative up to coherent homotopy . for us , operads will by default be _ coloured _ operads , i.e. we allow them to have many objects  these can be used to describe structures such as enriched categories or a pair of rings together with a bimodule . roughly speaking ,",
    "an operad @xmath0 consists of a set of objects , for each list of objects @xmath1 a set of multimorphisms @xmath2 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , equipped with an action of the symmetric group @xmath5 that permutes the inputs @xmath6 , and associative and unital composition operations for the multimorphisms .",
    "more generally , we can consider _ enriched _ operads , where the sets of multimorphisms are replaced by objects of some symmetric monoidal category , such as vector spaces or chain complexes ; these can be used to describe algebraic structures such as lie algebras or poisson algebras .    in topology , we typically encounter operads enriched in topological spaces ( or simplicial sets ) , such as the @xmath7-operads of may  @xcite . there is an evident notion of ( weak ) homotopy equivalence between such operads and one would like to consider the category of topological operads and weak equivalences as a homotopy theory . unfortunately , for many purposes it can be difficult to work with this theory , because topological operads are in a sense too rigid  for instance , a weak equivalence between topological operads @xmath8 and @xmath9 need not induce an equivalence between the homotopy theories of @xmath8-algebras and @xmath9-algebras",
    ". moreover , one often encounters structures that are naturally seen as operad algebras in a homotopy - coherent sense , but can be difficult to rigidify to fit in this framework  as a baby example , it is reasonable to think of symmetric monoidal categories as `` commutative monoids '' in the ( 2-)category of categories , but actual commutative monoids require the associativity and symmetry conditions to hold strictly , which is essentially never true for interesting examples .    for these reasons , it is desirable to have a usable theory of `` weak '' or homotopy - coherent operads , where composition of multimorphisms is only associative up to a ( specified ) coherent choice of higher homotopies , and homotopy - coherent algebras for them . the foundations for a theory of such _",
    "@xmath10-operads _ were set up by lurie in @xcite ; his work gives a powerful framework for working with homotopy - coherent algebraic structures , as evidenced by the many results obtained in @xcite after building these foundations .",
    "although lurie s model is by far the best - developed version of , a number of other models have been proposed , namely the _ dendroidal sets _ of moerdijk and weiss  @xcite and the closely related models of complete dendroidal segal spaces and denroidal segal operads of cisinski and moerdijk  @xcite , and the _ complete segal operads _ of barwick  @xcite .",
    "moreover , just as simplicial categories give a model for , we can consider simplicial operads as a model for ; appropriate model category structures on this category have been constructed by cisinski and moerdijk  @xcite and by robertson  @xcite .",
    "some comparisons between these different models are already known :    * cisinski and moerdijk compare the three dendroidal models in @xcite , and also compare dendroidal sets to simplicial operads in @xcite . *",
    "barwick compares his model to lurie s in @xcite .",
    "* heuts , hinich , and moerdijk obtain a partial comparison between dendroidal sets and lurie s model in @xcite .",
    "however , their result is restricted to operads without units .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to prove one of the missing comparisons : we will show that the homotopy theory of barwick s complete segal operads is equivalent to that of complete dendroidal segal spaces . to state a more precise version of our result , recall that barwick s segal operads are certain presheaves of spaces on a category @xmath11 , forming a full subcategory @xmath12 of the @xmath13 of presheaves",
    " we will refer to them as _",
    "segal presheaves _ on @xmath11 to avoid confusion with the segal operads of cisinski and moerdijk  @xcite , which are a dendroidal analogue of segal categories .",
    "similarly , the dendroidal segal spaces of cisinski and moerdijk are certain presheaves on a category @xmath14 ( we will likewise refer to them as _ segal presheaves _ on @xmath14 ) , forming a full subcategory @xmath15 of the @xmath16 of all presheaves .",
    "we will define a functor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a certain full subcategory , and prove :    [ thm : mainthm ] composition with the functors @xmath19 and @xmath20 induces equivalences of @xmath21 these functors restrict further to give equivalences between the full subcategories of complete objects .    here",
    "complete _ objects are those whose underlying segal spaces are complete in the sense of rezk  @xcite .",
    "we will prove that @xmath19 gives an equivalence in lemma  [ lem : ieq ] , that @xmath20 gives an equivalence in theorem  [ thm : taueq ] , and that we get equivalences on complete objects in corollary  [ cor : itaucseq ] .",
    "combining theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] with the above - mentioned comparison results already in the literature , this implies that all known models for are equivalent .",
    "in particular , we obtain the following interesting comparisons as an immediate consequence of our work :    the homotopy theory of lurie s is equivalent to that of dendroidal sets and to that of simplicial operads .",
    "although we have chosen to use the language of in this paper , as we believe this leads to a cleaner presentation of our work , our result can also be interpreted in the language of model categories : the @xmath15 , @xmath22 , and @xmath12 can be obtained from bousfield localizations of the projective ( or reedy ) model structures on the categories @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 of simplicial presheaves on @xmath14 , @xmath26 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that composition with @xmath19 with @xmath20 give right quillen functors between these localized model structures ( with left adjoints given by left kan extensions ) . in this language",
    ", our result says :    the quillen adjunctions @xmath27 @xmath28 are quillen equivalences , where the categories involved are equipped with the bousfield localizations of the respective projective model structures at the segal equivalences .",
    "moreover , they remain quillen equivalences if we localize further to get the model structures for complete objects .",
    "since a quillen adjunction is a quillen equivalence it induces an equivalence of homotopy categories , this is an immediate consequence of theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] .      in  [",
    "sec : segpshdf ] we review the definition of barwick s segal operads , which we will call segal presheaves on @xmath11 .",

    "finally , in  [ sec : complete ] we review the definition of _ complete _ segal presheaves on @xmath11 and @xmath14 , and observe that these agree under our equivalence .",
    "this paper is written in the language of ( or more specifically _ quasicategories _ ) , as developed by joyal  @xcite , lurie  @xcite and others .",
