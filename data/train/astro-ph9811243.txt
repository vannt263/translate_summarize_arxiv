    "more than a decade ago , it was suggested by witten @xcite that a flavor symmetric mixture of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-quarks known as strange quark matter ( sqm ) would be the most stable configuration of hadronic matter .",
    "an extensive theoretical investigations on the stability of both bulk as well as quasi - bulk properties of sqm using mit bag model and also with some other confinement models have proved the reality of such speculation @xcite . usually the strange quark is attributed a minor role in the standard model of the universe .",
    "however , it has also been suggested by witten that strange quark matter might be an important relic from the early universe and also a constituent of neutron stars .",
    "although strange quark matter could be absolutely stable and thus be the true ground state of hadronic matter , long - lived or stable strange quarks are only found in the regions with very high density , otherwise , the relatively large @xmath3-quark mass and the weak mixing to the down quarks lead to rapid decay . in a quark matter system , either at the core of a compact neutron star or in the early universe - microsecond after big bang , @xmath3-quarks are produced through a number of weak processes .",
    "it is generally believed that microsecond after big bang , the universe was completely filled with a hot and dense soup of quark matter .",
    "the survival of strange quark nuggets relic till today from the early universe is a controversial issue @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that a deconfinement transition to bulk quark matter may cur at the core of a neutron star if the density exceeds a few times normal nuclear matter density .",
    "in such a cold quark matter system , @xmath3-quarks are produced through weak processes .",
    "although the existence of strange quark nuggets relic produced as a result of first order qcd phase transition in the early universe is highly uncertain , the presence of exotic quark matter core in a compact neutron star can not be ruled out .",
    "a few years ago , madsen and hiselberg et .",
    "al . have investigated with detail numerical calculations the rate of @xmath3-quark production in dense quark matter in the context of survival of strange quark nuggets produced at the time of primordial qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "recently , glendenning and his group have reported a lot of exciting results on the existence of strange quark matter core in a compact neutron star and its effect on various gross - properties of hybrid stars @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that a transition to quark matter core may occur during slowing down of a old neutron star @xcite . a first order phase transition to quark matter at the core of a neutron star",
    "is also possible by seeding strange droplets from outside and by neutrino sparking @xcite .",
    "however , in none of these papers , the effect of strong magnetic field of the neutron star ( particularly in the case of newborn neutron star ) on such exotic matter have been considered .",
    "large magnetic fields are known to be present in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the direct evidence from pulsar observations show that the strength of this magnetic field at the neutron star surface is @xmath4 g .",
    "then it can very easily be shown by the scalar virial theorem that magnetic field strength at the core region of a neutron star may reach up to @xmath5 g @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , from the stability criteria of a compact magnetized neutron star it can very easily be shown following the famous work by chandrasekhar and fermi @xcite in the context of magnetized white dwarfs , that the upper limit for the strength of magnetic field at the core region is @xmath6 g .",
    "the presence of such strong magnetic field inside newborn neutron stars significantly modifies the order of qaurk - hadron phase transition at the core .",
    "it has been shown that a first order quark - hadron phase transition initiated by the nucleation ( by thermal or quantum fluctuation ) of quark droplets in a system of meta - stable neutron matter in presence of a strong magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) is absolutely forbidden @xcite . however , some higher order transitions , e.g. metal - insulator type of second order phase transition is allowed if the strength of magnetic field is @xmath8 g . which is of course too high to achieve at the core of a neutron star .",
    "even if the transition is of second order in nature , the gross properties of dense quark matter are considerably modified with respect to the field free case .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic field also affects the weak and electro - magnetic processes which may occur in the degenerate quark matter core @xcite .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic field shifts the @xmath9-equilibrium point of the quark matter system @xcite .",
    "it also affects the abundances of various components in @xmath9-equilibrium . the photon emission by bremsstrahlung , photon splitting and neutrino emission processes are significantly affected by the presence of strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that pulsar kicks are generated by the asymmetric neutrino emission in presence of strong magnetic fields @xcite . in a dense quark matter , since @xmath3-quarks are produced or annihilated through weak processes , the presence of strong magnetic field should also alter the production and decay rates of @xmath3-quarks . to the best of our knowledge , theoretical investigation of this particular problem has not been reported earlier . in the previous work by madsen and hiselberg et .",
    "@xcite the rate of @xmath3-quark production in degenerate cold quark matter ( @xmath10mev ) was studied for the field free case in the context of stability of strange nuggets as the relic of big bang deconfinement transition . in the present paper",
    "we shall study the effect of strong magnetic field on the net rates of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-quarks production and there by study the chemical evolution of nascent degenerate quark matter core in a compact neutron star",
    ". we shall also consider the effect of neutrino trapping in degenerate quark matter on the chemical evolution in presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "the main finding of this paper is that the chemical evolution of nascent quark matter core in presence of a strong magnetic field leads to an unphysical scenario- the final state in @xmath9-equilibrium is energetically unstable with respect to the normal hadronic matter of neutron star .",
    "although a flavor symmetric mixture of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-quarks at zero temperature is energetically much more stable than the corresponding field free case , the chemical evolution of a bulk system consisting of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-quarks ( not a flavor symmetric mixture ) shows that the quark matter core of a newborn neutron star may become energetically unstable if the magnetic field strength exceeds a typical value @xmath11 g , which is the strength of magnetic field at which the landau levels for electrons are populated and quantum mechanical effect of strong magnetic field on electrons become important .",
    "since the formation of a flavor symmetric quark matter at the central region of a compact neutron star is possible only through the chemical evolution of ordinary quark matter or @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 flavor asymmetric quark matter , it would really be interesting to investigate the time evolution of various species in the system both for field free case and in presence of a strong magnetic field .    for the sake of simplicity we neglect quark - quark interaction in the degenerate quark matter .",
    "the temperature of the system is taken to be @xmath12mev @xmath13 .",
    "the increase or decrease in temperature of the system causes an enhancement or suppression of effective production rate of @xmath3-quark respectively .",
    "however , it only makes a quantitative change in our result .",
    "the qualitative nature remains unaltered .",
    "it is further assumed that the external magnetic field @xmath14 is constant throughout the matter .",
    "the convenient choice of gauge is @xmath15 and @xmath16 corresponding to the constant magnetic field @xmath14 along z - axis .",
    "if the strength of magnetic field @xmath14 is greater than the critical value @xmath17 for the @xmath18-th charged particle , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the mass and charge of the @xmath18-th species , the corresponding single particle energy is given by @xmath21 , otherwise the usual expression for field free @xmath22 case is used , where @xmath23 is the landau quantum number .",
    "the critical strength of magnetic field as mentioned above can be obtained by equating the cyclotron quantum with the rest mass energy of the @xmath18-th charged particle .",
    "if the magnetic field strength exceeds this typical value , the quantum mechanical effect of strong magnetic field on the @xmath18-th charged component becomes important .",
    "this is known as landau diamagnetism . for electrons of mass @xmath24mev ,",
    "this typical strength is @xmath25 g , whereas for @xmath1 and @xmath2-quarks of current mass @xmath26mev , it is @xmath27 . on the other hand for @xmath3-quark of current mass @xmath28mev ,",
    "this typical value is @xmath29 g . which is too high to achieve even at the core of a newborn neutron star .",
    "therefore in the case of @xmath3-quarks , quantum mechanical effect of strong magnetic field is insignificant and results for the field free case are used .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner , in section 2 we have given the basic formalism to study the chemical evolution of compact and degenerate nascent quark matter core with non - degenerate neutrinos ( i.e. neutrinos are assumed to leave the system freely immediately after their formation ) , both in absence and presence of strong magnetic fields . in the case of @xmath30 , we have considered two possible scenarios-(i ) magnetic field strength is low enough so that only electrons are affected and ( ii ) the field strength is relatively stronger so that all the charged particle components except @xmath3-quarks are affected . in section 3",
    "we have discussed with detail numerical calculations , the effect of neutrino trapping on chemical evolution of the system for both @xmath31 and @xmath32 cases .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section 4 .",
    "to study the chemical evolution of degenerate quark matter at the core of a newborn neutron star we consider the following weak interaction processes which are taking place at the quark matter core @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 we further assume that the system is charge neutral and produced neutrinos / anti - neutrinos leave the system freely ( i.e. they are non - degenerate ) .",
    "the approach to chemical equilibrium of the system is governed by the following sets of kinetic equations @xmath38\\ ] ] @xmath39\\ ] ] baryon number conservation and charge neutrality conditions relate strange quark and electron abundances with that of @xmath1 and @xmath2-quark and are given by @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the abundance for the @xmath18-th component ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( for the degenerate neutrino case only ) ) , @xmath45 is the baryon number density , @xmath46 is the rate of @xmath18-th weak interaction process ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 is the rate of reverse process as indicated by eqn.(5 ) .    to study chemical evolution of the system",
    "we solve the differential eqns.(6 ) and ( 7 ) numerically along with two constraint equations , eqns.(8 ) and ( 9 ) and use the rates @xmath49 to @xmath48 , appear on the right hand side of eqns.(6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "since these differential equations are of first order in nature , we need at least one initial condition for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 in order to get the complete solutions . for a neutron star of mass @xmath52",
    "the baryon number density @xmath45 at the centre is of the order of @xmath53 , temperature @xmath54k and proton content is about @xmath55",
    ". then the initial conditions are given by @xmath56 .",
    "as a consequence of baryon number and charge conservation we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .      in this subsection we shall first derive the rates ( @xmath49 to @xmath59 ) for the processes given by eqns.(1)-(5 ) and also the rate @xmath48 for the reverse process as indicated by eqn.(5 ) , for the field",
    "free case .",
    "the reaction rate for the process ( 1 ) is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 stand for @xmath2 , @xmath62 , @xmath1 and @xmath63 respectively , @xmath64 , the equilibrium ( fermi ) distribution function for the @xmath18-th component and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 are respectively the @xmath68-momentum , energy and chemical potential of the particle @xmath18 , g is the weak coupling constant , @xmath69 is the cabibbo angle @xmath70 and t is the temperature of the system . the angular part of the integrals can be evaluated without any approximation @xcite and we get @xmath71 where @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the magnitude of three momentum vector and @xmath78 ( we assume @xmath79 ) .    in the case of a compact neutron star ,",
    "the central density is very high ( @xmath80 to have a deconfinement transition ) but the temperature is low enough ( @xmath54k ) , as a consequence @xmath1 , @xmath2 quarks and electrons are relativistic in nature and are strongly degenerate .",
    "under such an extreme condition all the integrals except one in eqn.(11 ) can be evaluated analytically and the final expression for rate of the process ( 1 ) is given by @xmath81 where in the expression for @xmath82 we have replaced energy and momentum of all the particles except the neutrino by their values on the fermi surface , i.e. we put @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we have also changed the integration variable @xmath85 to @xmath86 , where neutrino energy @xmath87 and @xmath88 which is zero in the @xmath9-equilibrium condition .",
    "following the same methodology , we have obtained the rate for the process ( 2 ) , given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 the reaction rates for the processes ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) corresponding to @xmath3-quark can very easily be evaluated by replacing all the parameters for @xmath2-quarks by the corresponding @xmath3-quark values ( i.e. @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 by @xmath95 in the expressions for @xmath49 and @xmath96 respectively .    for the weak process ( 5 ) we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 .    the reaction rate for the reverse process as shown in eqn.(5 )",
    "is related to the forward rate @xmath59 by @xmath99      we shall now evaluate the rates @xmath49 to @xmath48 in presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "we consider two possible cases : the magnetic field @xmath14 is not very high ( @xmath100 ) so that the quantum mechanical effect is important for electrons only , and finally the magnetic field is strong enough to affect all the charged particle components except @xmath3- quarks ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "let us first consider case 1 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath102 .",
    "to evaluate the rates for the weak processes ( 1)-(4 ) , we use the modified form of spinor solution of dirac equation in presence of a strong magnetic field for electron @xcite . for other charged particles , the usual plane wave dirac spinor solutions for field free case are used . since",
    "only electrons are affected , the rates for the process ( 5 ) and its reverse process will remain unchanged .    in this case the rate of the process ( 1 ) is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the charge carried by electron , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is the fermi momentum for electron .",
    "the sum @xmath23 is over landau quantum number for the electron which in principle can have all possible positive integer values including zero .",
    "similarly the rate for the process ( 2 ) is given by @xmath107 as before the rates for the processes ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) may be obtained by simply replacing all the parameters for @xmath2-quarks by the corresponding @xmath3-quark values and @xmath108 by @xmath95 in eqns.(20 ) and ( 21 ) respectively . whereas the rates for the direct and the reverse processes given by eqn.(5 ) remain unaltered .",
    "next we consider the second case possibility , @xmath109 . in this case modified spinor solutions for all the charged particle components except @xmath3-quark are used to evaluate rates of the weak processes @xcite . as we have noticed that compact analytical expressions for the rates can only be obtained if we assume that zeroth landau levels are populated for the magnetically affected charged species .",
    "otherwise we have to evaluate the rates numerically right from the beginning .",
    "the rate for the process ( 1 ) is given by @xmath110^{1/2 } \\cos^2\\theta_c t^4 \\frac{\\mu_u \\mu_e}{p_{f_u}p_{f_e } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\left[x_u + x_e + \\frac{\\mu_d -\\mu_u -\\mu_e}{t}\\right]^2 f(x_u ) f(x_e ) dx_u dx_e\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are respectively the charge carried by @xmath1 and @xmath2-quarks .",

    ". then we have the expressions for rates of the processes given by eqns.(3 ) and ( 4 ) for zero landau quantum number @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively .",

    "the rate for reverse reaction is as usual given by eqn.(19 ) .    to study chemical evolution of the system ,",
    "we have numerically solved the sets of kinetic equations given by eqns.(6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "as has already been mentioned , we have considered three possible scenarios : @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath136 and @xmath137 for the fractional abundances of @xmath1 and @xmath2-quarks",
    ". the rates of various processes ( eqns.(1)-(5 ) ) are also evaluated numerically and finally the charge neutrality and baryon number conservation conditions ( eqns.(8 ) and ( 9 ) ) are used to relate @xmath138 and @xmath139 , the fractional abundances for @xmath3-quark and electron respectively with that of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks . in fig.(1 ) we have plotted time evolution of the fractional abundances @xmath140 for @xmath141 and @xmath63 in the field free case .",
    "this figure shows that ultimately fractional abundances for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3-quarks and electron saturate to their equilibrium values . which is the chemical equilibrium condition among the participants .",
    "we have further noticed , that as the current mass @xmath142 for @xmath3-quark approaches the current mass of @xmath1 and @xmath2-quarks , the equilibrium values for fractional abundances of all the three types of quarks ultimately saturates to a constant value @xmath143 and the electron abundance @xmath144 .",
    "we have also investigated the sensitivity of initial conditions .",
    "we have considered a wide variation of proton fraction- from almost pure neutron matter ( proton fraction @xmath145 ) to symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "the qualitative nature of our results do not change with the change of initial condition .",
    "the change in initial condition only causes a change in saturation time scale .",
    "now we would like to see whether such theoretical observation supports the speculation of witten .",
    "we have verified whether the system in @xmath9-equilibrium is energetically stable or not .",
    "to do that , we have followed the following steps .",
    "( i ) using these equilibrium values for various components ( @xmath141 and @xmath63 ) we have obtained the equation of states for the quark matter system with @xmath31 , ( ii ) using the equation of state we have solved tov equation and obtained the mass of the quark core , which is @xmath147 for the central density @xmath148 and the corresponding radius is @xmath149 km . to obtain the mass of quark core in the field free case ,",
    "we assume that the deconfinement transition is first order in nature .",
    "the corresponding critical density for a typical bag parameter value @xmath150mev is @xmath151 .",
    "it has been observed that the mass of the core increases in presence of a magnetic field where as the radius of the core decreases , i.e. the core becomes more compact in presence of strong magnetic fields @xcite . to investigate the stability of such a bulk quark matter",
    ", we have calculated the energy per baryon using the relation @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the internal energy density of the species @xmath18 and @xmath154 is the magnetic energy density , which is zero in the field free case . using the saturation values for abundances for various components , we have seen that @xmath155 . which indicates that the chemical evolution of the system in field free case leads to a scenario which is energetically more stable than nuclear matter and the binding energy of the system is negative .",
    "therefore , the observation is in agreement with the speculation of witten . in fig.(2 ) we have plotted the variation of fractional abundances for various species with time for @xmath156 g , so that only electrons are affected . in the present scenario the deconfinement transition from hadronic matter to quark matter can not be first order .",
    "we assume the transition is metal - insulator type second order in nature . in this particular case , unlike a mixed phase of quark matter and hadronic matter in a first order quark hadron phase transition , we have a sharp interface between nuclear matter crust and quark matter core . at the sharp boundary",
    "all the thermodynamic variables change continuously , i.e. @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 . from these relations ,",
    "we obtain the variation of critical density with the strength of magnetic field . in fig.(3 ) we have shown this variation .",
    "the corresponding bag parameter also changes with the strength of magnetic field .",
    "the dashed curve in fig.(3 ) shows the variation of @xmath161 with the strength of magnetic field . in both the curves ,",
    "up to @xmath162 only electrons are affected beyond which we have considered the quantum mechanical effect of strong magnetic field on all the charged species except @xmath3-quark . in the nuclear matter sector , we have considered a @xmath163 exchange type of mean field model @xcite .",
    "these curves show that both the quantities remain almost constant ( equal to their values for field free case ) up to @xmath164 g , beyond which they become extremely large . as it is obvious from fig.(2 ) that in this particular case , the net production of @xmath3-quark starts after @xmath165sec , which is much earlier than the field free case , but @xmath166 goes to zero by @xmath167sec and then it remains zero for ever .",
    "it is also obvious from the figure that in this case @xmath2 quark abundance also goes to zero by the same time scale and in the chemical equilibrium condition it remains zero .",
    "the system in chemical equilibrium is therefore mainly consists of @xmath1-quarks and electrons .",
    "if we translate this scenario to the case of a neutron star , this is equivalent to a proton rich core .",
    "as a consequence direct urca process will play the main role in the cooling process by neutrino emission from this region , provided it is energetically stable @xcite . to study the stability of such abnormal system , we have calculated internal energy per unit volume . near nuclear density",
    "it is @xmath168mev@xmath169 , which corresponds to free energy per baryon @xmath170 and also @xmath171 energy per baryon for hadronic matter .",
    "the magnetic energy density is negligibly small compared to internal energy density of the system unless the magnetic field is @xmath172 g . in this particular case ,",
    "the overall energy of the system is therefore equal to the kinetic energy of the system .",
    "this indicates that the system is therefore energetically unstable if the magnetic field affects electrons present in the system . in fig.(4 )",
    "we have plotted the abundances for various species against time for @xmath173 g . in this case all the charged particles except @xmath3-quarks are affected .",
    "we have seen that @xmath3-quark production is absolutely forbidden in this particular scenario .",
    "the system behaves like a neutron rich ( rich in @xmath2-quark ) core . in this case",
    "free energy per unit volume is @xmath174mev@xmath169 near normal nuclear density , which again corresponds to energy per baryon @xmath170 and also @xmath171 energy per baryon for hadronic matter .",
    "therefore , in this case also , the system is energetically unstable .",
    "we have also noticed that the presence of a small percentage of @xmath175-hyperons in the core region before phase transition does not change the conclusions . in figs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) we have plotted the abundances for the species with time for the presence of @xmath176 @xmath175-hyperon before phase transition to quark matter for @xmath31 and @xmath173 g respectively .",
    "we have noticed that for the field free case , the time evolution leads to a stable configuration , where as for the presence of strong magnetic field the system becomes energetically unstable in the chemical equilibrium condition .",
    "therefore the presence of @xmath175-hyperons in hadronic matter ( which is most likely if the density of hadronic matter exceeds a few times normal nuclear density ) before deconfinement transition does not change our conclusion .",
    "next we shall consider the effect of neutrino trapping on the stability of quark matter core in presence of strong magnetic fields in the next section .",
    "in this section we shall develop a formalism to investigate the chemical evolution of the system considering the effect of neutrino degeneracy on the weak reaction rates for the field free case and also in presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "assuming the formation of a neutron star immediately after supernova explosion , then at the beginning the matter within the remnant , particularly at the central region is extremely lepton rich ( neutrino trapped ) .",
    "such an object is called proto - neutron star .",
    "normally it takes a few second to convert a proto - neutron star to a neutron star by the emission of trapped neutrinos .",
    "if the density of such matter exceeds @xmath177 , a deconfinement transition to neutrino trapped quark matter can occur at the core region . to study the chemical evolution of this neutrino trapped quark matter",

    "as before , we first assume that @xmath190 , so that only electrons are affected quantum mechanically by the magnetic field . in this case",

    "the rate for the process ( 35 ) is given by eqn.(41 ) , which is the expression for field free case .",

    "the rate is given by @xmath197 @xmath198 the rate for the process ( 35 ) is given by the combination of eqns.(31 ) and ( 19 ) .",
    "in the degenerate neutrino case , we have plotted the time evolution of fractional abundances for various species in the filed free case in fig.(7 ) . in this case",
    "the system is marginally stable , internal energy density is @xmath199mev@xmath169 .",
    "since it takes a few second to convert such a system to conventional system of sqm with non - degenerate neutrinos by neutrino emission , we may conclude that it is possible to have an energetically stable quark matter core from the deconfinement transition at the central region of a compact proto - neutron star . in the case when @xmath200 , i.e. , only electrons are affected , we have seen that almost all the neutrinos are absorbed in the system momentarily and to keep lepton number constant , electron density increases by several orders of magnitude . as a consequence of charge neutrality condition",
    ", the @xmath1-quark density also increases by the same orders of magnitude .",
    "but the conservation of baryon number of the system causes decrease in @xmath2-quark density almost by the same orders of magnitude .",
    "the situation is happened to be the most unphysical one . in this case",
    "the binding energy calculation shows that the system is extremely unstable . in this case internal energy density",
    "is @xmath201mev@xmath169 near normal nuclear density . in the case of strong magnetic field",
    "( @xmath202 ) , when all the charged components except @xmath3-quark are affected , we have shown the time dependence of fractional abundances in fig.(8 ) . in this case",
    "also @xmath3-quarks are never produced and the conclusion does not change if there are a few @xmath175-hyperons at the central region of proto - neutron star before phase transition .",
    "we have also seen that electron density goes up by several orders of magnitude , as a consequence @xmath1-quark density also increases and the system behaves like a neutrino trapped proton core ( if we translate it to proto - neutron star without quark core ) .",
    "the scenario is also unphysical in this case .",
    "the internal energy of the system is @xmath203mev@xmath169 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that in presence of a strong magnetic field , with trapped neutrinos , the formation of quark matter core by deconfinement transition at the central region of a compact neutron star is also energetically forbidden .",
    "we have studied the chemical evolution of quark matter core in presence of a strong magnetic field and compared our results with that of field free case .",
    "we have noticed that in presence of a magnetic field of strength at least greater than @xmath204 , the critical field strength to populate landau levels for electrons , quark matter core in compact neutron star or proto - neutron star is not possible .",
    "the quark matter core is energetically unstable with respect to normal hadronic matter in presence of such strong magnetic field . on the other hand",
    "if a charge neutral sqm in beta equilibrium is placed in an external strong magnetic field the system becomes energetically more stable compared to field free case .",
    "we have also seen that the presence of @xmath175-hyperons at the core of a neutron star before phase transition to deconfined quark matter does not alter the characteristic of newborn quark matter core in presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "we have also noticed that our conclusion is insensitive with the numerical value of proton fraction .",
    "therefore , the final conclusion is that the quark matter core is not at all possible in a compact neutron star or proto - neutron star if the magnetic field at the central region exceeds at least the critical value for electron to populate landau levels . in an earlier work we showed that a first order qcd phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter is not possible in presence of a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "even if a metal - insulator type second order phase transition is possible , the stability criteria does not allow the formation of quark matter core in a compact neutron star or in a proto - neutron star .",
    "however , such a phase transition is possible in the case of a very old neutron star by matter accretion , during slowing down of a pulser which may cause further contraction of neutron star , nucleation of sqm by some external sources or by neutrino sparking . instead of a phase transition to quark matter",
    "it is possible to have kaon condensed hadronic matter at the core region .",
    "it would be interesting to see what is the effect of strong magnetic field on such condensed state .",
    "it can also be a di - quark matter .",
    "it would also be interesting to study the effect of strong magnetic field on such matter .",
