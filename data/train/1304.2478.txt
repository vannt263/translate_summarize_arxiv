    "the number of dark matter subhalos surrounding the milky way has puzzled dark matter aficionados for over more than a decade .",
    "while cosmic large - scale structures are well described by the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) cosmological model , a number of discrepancies exist between the standard theory of galaxy formation and observations of substructures at smaller scales @xcite .",
    "in particular , numerical @xmath0cdm simulations consistently predict that galaxies must be surrounded by a huge population of subhalos @xcite .",
    "intuitively , subhalos would encompass anything from the largest satellites ( _ e.g. _ dwarf galaxies ) to substructures with masses around @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , completing a survey of the smallest gravitationally bound systems is not straightforward @xcite . at faint flux levels",
    ", it becomes ever more difficult to recognise sparsely populated stellar systems .",
    "important progress has been made recently resulting from newly discovered ultra - faint dwarf galaxies , which have nearly doubled the number of known dwarfs @xcite .",
    "yet the dwarf counts in the milky way remains far to small compared to the number of subhalos predicted by simulations .",
    "interestingly , the discovery of compact hydrogen clouds potentially located in the galactic halo has revived the possibility of a larger population of galaxy candidates that could be traced by neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "this point was made even earlier by @xcite who recognised that the much broader and physically distinct set of enigmatic hi structures commonly referred to as high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) could represent the missing dark matter subhalo population @xcite .",
    "although intriguing , to date , a firm hi cloud - subhalo link has not been established @xcite .    prompted by the recent release of the galfa hi compact cloud catalogue @xcite",
    ", we revisit the possibility that some compact hydrogen clouds can be used as a proxy for missing dark matter subhalos .",
    "there are inherent problems when trying to test this possibility , especially the lack of distance and mass information for such systems .",
    "another major hurdle is the absence of associated stellar populations in most compact hydrogen clouds .",
    "in fact , it is even possible that many of these systems never formed stars @xcite . @xcite proposed exploiting `` pixel gravitational lensing '' as a way to map the dark matter content in hydrogen clouds .",
    "however , the shortage of properly aligned nearby background galaxies prevents a generalised application to a large sample .        for this reason",
    ", we explore a different approach to determine their dark matter content .",
    "if compact hydrogen clouds are dark matter dominated systems , nearby dense objects could potentially produce a detectable dark matter annihilation signal in gamma rays @xcite . in that vein",
    ", @xcite looked for spatial coincidences between unidentified egret sources and hvcs . with the vast improvements in gamma - ray sensitivity and angular resolution afforded by _",
    "@xcite , we can search for annihilating dark matter in galfa - hi compact hydrogen clouds directly .",
    "this study should serve not only to investigate a possible tracer of gas - bearing dark matter seeds that never formed stars , but also to set a general upper bound on the annihilation cross section @xmath2 of a hypothesised weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "searches for dark matter signals using _",
    "fermi _ have been conducted unsuccessfully in a wide variety of astrophysical systems @xcite .",
    "this work simply extends the hunt to a new sample .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we explain the selection of high - latitude galaxy candidates from the galfa - hi compact cloud catalogue , as well as the _ fermi _ lat analysis . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we derive gamma - ray flux upper limits for segue 1 and set dark matter annihilation constraints for the galaxy candidates .",
    "finally , we briefly summarise our interpretation and possible future directions in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the galfa - hi compact cloud catalogue @xcite is generated from the galactic arecibo @xmath3-band feed array hi ( galfa - hi ) survey data release one @xcite . at completion ,",
    "galfa - hi will cover 13,000 deg@xmath4 of the sky in the 1420 mhz hyperfine transition of hydrogen between @xmath5 km s@xmath6 . using a novel cloud detection algorithm , @xcite identified a total of 1964 compact ( @xmath7 ) hydrogen clouds in the initial 7520 deg@xmath4 data release one .",
    "the catalogue breaks down the clouds into a scheme that includes high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , galaxy candidates , cold low - velocity clouds ( clvc ) , warm low - velocity clouds , and warm positive low - velocity clouds in the third galactic quadrant . for our purposes , we are only concerned with the 27 possible galaxy candidates that might form the core sample of potentially undiscovered dark matter subhalos . in order to guard against possible gaseous disk interlopers that may have been pushed into the halo by stellar feedback @xcite , we also prune galaxy candidates at @xmath8 . finally , we are left with a subset of 20 high - latitude galaxy candidates . in fig .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    in order to explore the gamma - ray emission , we use the publicly available dataset acquired by the large area telescope ( lat ) instrument on board the  gamma - ray space telescope @xcite .",
    "the lat is a pair - conversion gamma - ray detector sensitive to photon energies from 20 mev to 300 gev .",
    "we retrieve all photons of ` source ' class ( ` evclass=2 ` ) within a 10@xmath9 circular region centred at the position of each galaxy candidate .",
    "the data analysed here were collected between 2008 august 4 and 2012 november 20 ( approximately 4.3 years of data ) .",
    "good time intervals were processed using the available ` v9r27p1 ` _ fermi _ science tools with the standard ` p7source_v6 ` instrument response function . throughout , we apply a maximum zenith angle cut of 100@xmath9 .",

    "the _ fermi _ lat point spread function ( psf ) is typically @xmath12gev@xmath13deg , which in our selected energy range restricts the photons to less than 1@xmath9 around each location @xcite .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarises the 95% confidence level upper limits . since the _",

    "if compact hydrogen clouds are highly dark matter dominated objects their gamma - ray emission should be well characterised by a differential spectrum that can be written as    @xmath14    where @xmath2 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section , @xmath15 is the dark matter particle mass , and @xmath16 is the photon spectrum of annihilation products @xcite . the second term , or the so - called astrophysical factor @xmath17 , corresponds to the integration of the dark matter density squared @xmath18 along the line of sight @xmath19 of the compact cloud , over a solid angle @xmath20 , so that @xmath21    in principle , we expect compact clouds to be virtually free of gamma - ray emission from embedded diffuse and individual point sources . as a result , it is reasonable to expect that the differential spectrum from dark matter annihilation should dominate any gamma - ray signal in the direction of observation to these systems .",
    "formally , a robust computation of an upper limit on the annihilation cross section @xmath2 requires some knowledge of the astrophysical factor @xmath17 of the system under consideration .",
    "given a lack of direct observational constraints on the astrophysical factors of these galaxy candidates @xmath22 , we are only able to estimate @xmath2 bounds from our sample by tying them to potentially similar systems in the milky way . under the ansatz that they are strongly dark matter dominated , the newly discovered ultra - faint dwarf galaxies would appear to be the closest relatives to compact hydrogen clouds @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite , segue 1 represents the darkest of these systems with a very high mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath23 3400 m@xmath24/l@xmath24 ) and dark matter density @xmath25 m@xmath24 pc@xmath26 .",
    "it also boasts the largest astrophysical factor for known dwarfs @xmath27 gev@xmath4 @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we derive upper limits on @xmath2 relative to the bounds already imposed for segue 1 using _ fermi _ measurements @xcite . accordingly , we repeat the previous _ fermi _ lat analysis now centred on segue 1 @xmath29 . the corresponding gamma - ray",
    "upper limit for segue 1 is @xmath30 ( 1300 gev ) = 3.5 @xmath31 ph @xmath32 s@xmath6 . in order to turn our flux upper limits into",
    "a bound on @xmath2 , we need to assume a specific annihilation channel .",
    "we adopt the strictest possible limit on dark matter annihilation into bottom quarks @xmath33 for segue 1 based on 3 years of _ fermi _ data , which translates into @xmath34 @xmath35   s@xmath6 for particle masses @xmath36 gev @xcite .",
    "assuming the annihilation to be purely into @xmath33 and an average flux for the galaxy candidates @xmath37 ph @xmath32 s@xmath6 , we can approximate @xmath38 from these systems as    @xmath39    for @xmath36 gev wimp masses annihilating to @xmath33 , depending on the yet unknown @xmath40",
    "we have reported gamma - ray flux upper limits for a subset of galaxy candidates from the galfa - hi compact cloud catalogue .",
    "it is difficult to imagine any of these systems beating the astrophysical factors of known dwarf galaxies that spans the gamut from @xmath41 gev@xmath4 @xmath28 for carina to @xmath42 gev@xmath4 @xmath28 for the ultra - faint dwarf galaxy segue 1 @xcite . without mass and distance constraints",
    ", it will be difficult to place compact clouds in the context of other measurements .",
    "it is generally assumed that in order to be self gravitating , compact clouds could pack masses as low as a few m@xmath24 to greater than @xmath43 m@xmath24 for outer systems @xcite .",
    "our naive expectation is that @xmath44 should hold in most cases .    as an illustration ,",
    "the average compact cloud properties indicate a mass of @xmath45 m@xmath24 and a physical size of @xmath46 pc at distance of 100 kpc @xcite . since the astrophysical factor is proportional to the density squared , we can roughly approximate @xmath47 for @xmath48 m@xmath24 @xcite . to be sure ,",
    "arguments consistent with an interpretation that segue 1 is a tidally disrupting star cluster contaminated by the sagittarius stream should be definitively ruled out @xcite .",
    "for the entire family of ultra - faint galaxies , it is also critical to derive more reliable estimates of the @xmath49-factor @xcite .",
    "this null result joins the ranks of past dark matter annihilation searches , which have failed to detect a gamma - ray signal in systems suspected of high dark matter content @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as with the rest of dark matter pursuits , this is an everything or nothing undertaking . here",
    ", we are further hampered by the fact that we are seeking a detection with nearly no information about distances and masses of the objects involved .",
    "nonetheless , _ fermi _ will continue to collect data and stricter gamma - ray limits for these systems can be reached . above @xmath50 100",
    "gev , the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will be crucial to escalate the dark matter search to unprecedented bounds @xcite .",
    "there is also sufficient motivation to explore signatures for other reasonable dark matter candidates at other wavelengths @xcite .    from our measurements ,",
    "it is still unclear where galfa - hi galaxy candidates fit in the larger dark matter subhalo picture .",
    "searches for stellar counterparts associated with these gas - bearing systems are underway and should intensify @xcite .",
    "if this goal is accomplished , member stars could be used to produce a dark matter density profile . in an optimistic scenario ,",
    "compact clouds could validate a sort of `` hiding in plain sight '' model whereby dark matter subhalos at small scales would be traced directly through neutral hydrogen .    alternatively , dedicated observational studies could finally establish that all compact clouds are purely baryonic and hence devoid of dark matter @xcite . the disagreement between observations and @xmath0cdm simulations might then have to be invoke more inventive solutions @xcite .",
    "regardless , the potential dark matter fingerprint discussed here stands a possible diagnostic of suspected nearby dark matter dominated galactic candidates . with the advent of skymapper @xcite and the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite",
    ", it might be possible to trace the subhalo population directly using faint stars . a cross - match between stellar concentrations and compact hydrogen cloud positions",
