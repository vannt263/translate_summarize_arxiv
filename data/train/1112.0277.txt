    "the bulk and the shear viscosity coefficients are transport coefficients which enter in hydrodynamical equations and thus are important for studying of nonequilibrium evolution of any thermodynamic system .",
    "although experimental value of the shear viscosity was found to be small in the hadron gas @xcite , @xcite there are two more additional reasons to study the shear viscosity .",
    "the first one is the experimentally observed minimum of the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density @xmath2 near the liquid - gas phase transition for different substances which may help in studying of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram and finding of the location of the critical point @xcite , @xcite . for a counterexample see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the second reason is calculation of the @xmath2 in strongly interacting systems , preferably real ones , for testing of the conjectured lowest bound @xmath3 @xcite , found in some conformal field theories having dual gravity theories , and search of a new one .",
    "the bound @xmath3 was violated with different counterexamples . for some reasonable ones",
    "see @xcite , @xcite . also see the recent review @xcite",
    ". the bulk viscosity may be not negligibly small and is expected to have a maximum near the phase transition @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    whether one uses the kubo formula or the boltzmann equation one faces nearly the same integral equation for transport coefficients @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the preferable way to solve",
    "it is the variational ( or ritz ) method . due to its complexity",
    "often the relaxation time approximation is used in the framework of the boltzmann equation .",
    "though this approximation is inaccurate , does not allow to control precision of approximation and can potentially lead to large deviations .",
    "the main difficulty in the variational method is in calculation of collision integrals . to calculate any transport coefficient in the lowest approximation in a mixture like the hadron gas with very large number of components @xmath4",
    "one would need to calculate roughly @xmath5 special 12-dimensional integrals if only elastic collisions are considered .",
    "fortunately it s possible to simplify these integrals considerably and perform these calculations in reasonable time .",
    "this paper contains calculations of the shear and the bulk viscosity coefficients for the hadron - resonance gas in the constant elastic differential cross sections model .",
    "the calculations are done in the framework of the boltzmann equation with classical boltzmann statistics , without medium effects and with the ideal gas equation of state .",
    "the constant cross sections and the boltzmann statistics approximation allows one to obtain some relatively simple analytical closed - form expressions .",
    "the numerical calculations for the hadron - resonance gas presented in this paper are the first step towards calculations with number - changing ( inelastic ) processes taken into account . then , possibly , more realistic model of strong interactions and quantum statistics will be implemented .",
    "these calculations can be considered as quite precise at low temperatures where elastic collisions dominate and equation of state is close to the ideal gas equation of state .",
    "the main applications of the results of this paper are to hydrodynamical description of heavy ion collisions , like in @xcite .",

    "are performed and the results are found to be close to the results in @xcite where only elastic processes were considered and the ideal gas equation of state was used or to the results in @xcite ( at zero chemical potential ) where the bose statistics was used instead of the boltzmann one .",

    "the discrepancies arise because of the constant cross sections approximation used in this paper .",

    "the number - changing @xmath10 processes were neglected too and the non - vanishing value of the bulk viscosity is obtained due to trace anomaly and the mass of pions . at small temperatures where effects of trace anomaly are small",

    "for example , at @xmath11 the bulk viscosity is roughly 20 times more .",
    "the calculations in @xcite are done in the framework of the boltzmann equation and have divergent dependence of the @xmath12 for @xmath13 because of weak @xmath10 number - changing processes taken into account for more details . ] and at @xmath14 the bulk viscosity is nearly 44 times larger than the bulk viscosity calculated in this paper . though calculations in @xcite were done in the first order approximation which does not even take into account elastic collisions so that this discrepancy can become smaller few times after more accurate calculations .",
    "the function @xmath12 may turn out to be not smooth at the middle temperatures and the smooth function @xmath12 is to be obtained through extrapolation . in @xcite",
    "the bulk viscosity was calculated in the framework of the boltzmann equation with the ideal gas equation of state and only elastic collisions taken into account .",

    "the bulk viscosity increases rapidly so that the ratio @xmath15 increases with the temperature .",
    "calculation of the shear viscosity in the hadron gas , done in @xcite using some approximate formula and in @xcite using relaxation time approximation , are in good agreement with calculations in this paper .",
    "the bulk viscosity of the hadron gas , calculated in @xcite has similar dependence on the temperature though it is roughly 10 - 30 times more than the bulk viscosity calculated in this paper . at low temperature @xmath16 and vanishing chemical potentials",

    "this model has chiral symmetry restoration phase transition and can qualitatively describe pion gas .",
    "these calculations demonstrate example that the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density @xmath2 has the minimum near the phase transition and the ratio of the bulk viscosity to the entropy density @xmath15 can have a maximum near the phase transition for some values of the vacuum sigma mass if the peak in the @xmath9 is sharp enough .",

    "if colliding particles are identical and their differential cross section is integrated over the momentums ( or the spatial angle to get the total cross section ) then it should be multiplied on the factor @xmath31 to cancel double counting of the momentum states .",

    "will be called the classical differential cross sections .    from the analysis of semi - empirical total elastic cross sections in @xcite for @xmath7 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 collisions one can find that the elastic part without resonance contribution of the total cross sections lies approximately in the range @xmath37 ( except for @xmath36 cross section reaching @xmath38 for small energies ) . from comparison of these values with the total cross sections in the hard spheres model one finds for the radius @xmath39 . for simplification",
    "the mean value is chosen equal to @xmath0 in numerical calculations for all hadron and resonance elastic cross sections .",
    "then classical differential cross sections become equal to some one constant value too . in this approximation",
    "the cross section will enter in the transport coefficients as one factor .",
    "first the applicability of the boltzmann equation and of calculations of transport coefficients should be clarified .",
    "although the boltzmann equation is valid for any perturbations of the distribution function it should be a slowly varying function of space - time coordinate to justify that it can be considered as a function of macroscopic quantities like temperature , chemical potential or flow velocity or in other words that one can apply thermodynamics locally . then one can make expansion over independent gradients of thermodynamic functions and flow velocity ( the chapman - enskog method ) , which vanish in equilibrium .",
    "smallness of these perturbations of the distribution functions in compare to theirs main parts ensures the validity of this expansion and that the gradients are small . of this paper .",
    "the smallness of the shear and the bulk viscosity gradients can also be checked by the condition of smallness of the @xmath40 ( [ t1 ] ) in compare to the @xmath41 ( [ t0 ] ) . ]",
    "because these perturbations are inversely proportional to coupling constants one can say that they are proportional to some product of particles mean free paths and the gradients .",
    "so that in other words the mean free paths should be much smaller than the characteristic lengths on which macroscopic quantities change considerably .",
    "the system with number - changing processes should be treated additionally .",
    "number - changing processes are very important for the bulk viscosity .",
    "if the coupling constant of inelastic number - changing processes is small then the bulk viscosity is dominated by the inelastic processes @xcite . formally tending coupling constants of inelastic processes to zero",
    "the bulk viscosity diverges together with the nonequilibrium perturbations of the distribution functions , which should be small . though this dependence can become invalid earlier",
    "if inelastic processes are negligible in some sense , because the limiting case with completely switched off inelastic processes can be well defined .",
    "that s why there is a need to specify reasonable conditions when inelastic processes can be neglected .",
    "some simple ones of them are proposed below .",
    "it is smallness of the time @xmath42 on which the system s evolution is considered in compare to the mean free time for number - changing processes of the @xmath43-th particle species , @xmath44 ( [ tkinel ] ) , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the rate of inelastic processes per particle of the @xmath43-th species . similar condition , stating that the number of reactions is smaller than unity , can be used : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the system s volume and @xmath49 is the number of the inelastic reactions of particles of the @xmath43-th species over all channels per unit time per unit volume . though in mixtures with mean free times of inelastic processes close to each other one might need to use relevant sums of reaction rates instead of reaction rates for certain species .",

    "is expected to be smaller",
    ".    errors due to the boltzmann statistics used instead of the bose or the fermi ones were found to be small for vanishing chemical potentials .- th particle species are bosons and if @xmath51 then there is ( local ) bose - einstein condensation for them which should be treated in a special way . ] according to calculations for the pion gas in @xcite the bulk viscosity becomes @xmath52 larger at @xmath53 and @xmath54 larger at @xmath55 for vanishing chemical potential .",
    "although the relative deviations of the thermodynamic quantities of the pion gas at nonvanishing chemical potential @xmath56 are not more than @xmath57 the bulk viscosity becomes up to @xmath58 times more .",
    "the shear viscosity becomes @xmath59 less at @xmath53 and @xmath52 less at @xmath55 for vanishing chemical potential and @xmath54 less at @xmath53 and @xmath60 less at @xmath55 for the @xmath56 .",
    "the corrections to the bulk viscosity of the fermion gas , according to calculations of the bulk viscosity source term not presented in this paper , are of the opposite sign and approximately of the same magnitude .",
    "the condition of applicability of the ideal gas equation of state is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath61 which appears in the first correction from the binary collisions in the virial expansion and should be small . here",
    "@xmath62 is the so called excluded volume parameter and @xmath63 is the mean volume per particle .",
    "one finds @xmath64 at @xmath53 and @xmath65 at @xmath14 for vanishing chemical potentials . though even small corrections to thermodynamic quantities can result in large corrections for the bulk viscosity as it was found for the quantum statistics corrections . along the freeze - out line ( its parameters can be found in @xcite ) the @xmath61 grows from @xmath66 to @xmath67 with the temperature .",
    "one more important requirement which one needs to justify the boltzmann equation approach is that the mean free time should be much larger than @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is the characteristic single - particle energy ) @xcite or de broglie wavelength should be much smaller than the mean free path @xcite to distinguish independent acts of collisions and for particles to have well - defined on - shell energy and momentum .",
    "this condition gets badly satisfied for high temperatures or densities .",
    "the mean free path of particle species @xmath43 is given by the formula ( [ mfp ] ) or the formula ( [ lel ] ) if inelastic processes can be neglected .",
    "the wavelength can be written as @xmath70 , where the averaged modulus of momentum of @xmath43-th species @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the modified bessel function of the second kind . as it follows from the ( [ avmom ] )",
    "the largest wavelength is for the lightest particles , @xmath75-mesons .",
    "the elastic collision mean free paths are close to each other for all particle species .",
    "hence , the smallest value of the ratio @xmath76 is for @xmath75-mesons .",
    "its value is close to the value of the @xmath61 and is exponentially suppressed for small temperatures too . at temperature @xmath14 and vanishing chemical potentials",
    "this ratio is equal to @xmath77 .",
    "along the freeze - out line it grows from @xmath78 to @xmath79 with the temperature .",
    "if the last requirement is not satisfied one can use the kubo formulas , for instance .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that intermediate integral equations for the shear and the bulk viscosities coming after linearization of the boltzmann equation and expansion over gradients of the flow velocity can be reproduced from the kubo formulas in scalar @xmath80 theory .",
    "the difference is in that one has to replace particles masses with temperature dependent ones and to use thermal matrix elements for elastic and inelastic collisions .",
