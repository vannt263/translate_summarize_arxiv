    "as early as the 1930s von neumann @xcite recognized that quantum correlations are crucial to understanding the quantum measurement process .",
    "he considered measurement as a process that first required correlating the system with the quantum apparatus through a unitary , information conserving , quantum evolution . to complete the measurement a mechanism",
    "was needed by which this pure , correlated state decayed into a mixture approximately diagonal in the basis of observation . in recent decades ,",
    "the process of decoherence , which explains the dynamical origin of the above decay , has been extensively studied @xcite . by employing an open - systems approach , the effect of the interaction between the measurement apparatus and",
    "its environment was included explicitly , and von neumann s method was extended .",
    "the physical origin of the process of decoherence is very simple : the quantum correlations between the apparatus and the environment that are established in the course of their interaction is responsible for the dynamical selection of a preffered set of states of the apparatus ( the pointer states )",
    ". the mechanisms of decoherence are now a subject of great practical interest .",
    "some of the recent work on decoherence includes the determination of emergent properties of pointer states @xcite , efforts to design specific pointer states by engineering the environment @xcite , and identification of the time - scales of the decoherence process @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest and most illustrative models of decoherence was originally suggested and studied by zurek @xcite .",
    "it consists of a two level system ( a spin @xmath2 particle ) coupled to @xmath3 two level systems through a @xmath1 type interaction . with this model , in the large @xmath3 limit , it is possible to show that the correlations which arise between the system and the environment lead to the damping of the system coherence , encoded in the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix . in this work",
    "we will present results , both theoretical and experimental , for a two - level system that is coupled to a few other two - level systems , which shows that by manipulating the latter one can reproduce the essential features of zurek s model .",
    "interest in this and other decoherence models ( for example a two - level system coupled to a boson bath @xcite ) , has grown over the last few years due to the development of quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "a major challenge in qip is the preservation of quantum coherence in the face of constant perturbations by an environment . while one could try to isolate the qip device",
    ", this would make controlling the system difficult .",
    "therefore , other strategies like quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite and noiseless subsystems ( nss ) @xcite have been developed .",
    "the aim of this work is to develop methods to emulate decoherence in a physical setting , such as a qip device , so that the nature and underlying physics of decoherence can be better understood and applied in the development of control strategies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the essential features of decoherence reviewing the model proposed by zurek in which the system consists of a single spin while the environment is composed of an ensemble of @xmath3 spins . in section iii",
    "we describe a simple model in which the environment is limited to only a few spins ( qubits ) and analyze a strategy through which these few spins can simulate a much larger effective environment .",
    "the strategy consists of randomly redressing the phase of the environment qubits during their interaction with the system and averaging over many realizations of this evolution .",
    "we describe an exact solution of this model in the case of a @xmath4 coupling between the system and a single environment qubit . in this case",
    "we provide an analytic description of the decoherence ( phase - damping and decoupling ) effects that arise under specific limiting conditions and also derive the associated kraus operators for the model .",
    "a more detailed numerical analysis of this model is given for the case in which the environment consists of two qubits . in section iv ,",
    "we present nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) qip simulations for the two qubit environment and comparisons of these results with the one and two qubit environment predictions and numerical simulations . in section v ,",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the extension of this model to more general decoherence mechanisms .",
    "in this section we review the basic elements of quantum decoherence by presenting an open - system model due to zurek @xcite which is simple enough to be solved analytically . in spite of its simplicity",
    "the model captures many of the elements of decoherence theories and sheds insight into the loss of coherence , the onset of irreversibility , and in particular , the role played by the size of the environment .",
    "consider @xmath3 two - level systems and focus on one system as the subsystem of interest .",
    "this subsystem interacts with the rest of the system through a bilinear interaction .",
    "the overall dynamics is described by _",
    "se = ^n_k=2j_1k^1_z^k_z , [ eq3 ] where the system qubit is denoted by the superscript @xmath5. this hamiltonian is energy conserving and only causes phase damping .",
    "the prescription of the open - systems approach is to evolve the combined system and environment , represented by the density matrix @xmath6 , and then recover the system density matrix from a partial trace over the environment degrees of freedom : ^s(t)=tr_e\\{^se(t)}= (    cc ^s_00(t ) & ^s_01(t ) + ^s_10(t ) & ^s_11(t )    ) .",
    "[ rhos00 ] in eq .",
    "[ rhos00 ] @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the system population terms while @xmath9 represents the system coherence term .",
    "if the coherence terms vanish , the pure state is turned into a mixture in the computational basis ( @xmath10-basis ) , i.e. a `` pointer basis '' has been selected out by _ einselection_. an important observation is that , in the absence of a self - hamiltonian , the system s statonary states are selected out by the interaction hamiltonian . in fact , since @xmath11=0 $ ] , the interaction with the environment has two memory states @xmath12 as eigenstates and the populations remain unchanged throughout the system s evolution .",
    "the coupling in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] is therefore a purely phase damping mechanism and there is no energy exchange between system and environment .",

    "s_e + & = & ( a_1+b_1)^n_k=2(_k_k+_k_k ) .",

    "the off - diagonal element of the system s reduced density matrix ( system coherence ) is ^s_01(t)=_1tr_e\\{_se_se}_1 , so that ^s_01(t)=ab^*z(t ) where z(t)=^n_k=2[|_k|^2e^-2ij_1kt+|_k|^2e^2ij_1kt ] . recall that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the coefficients of the initial pure state of the system .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath17 contains the crucial information for understanding the behavior of the system coherence .",
    "in particular , the magnitude of @xmath17 determines the damping of the phase information originally contained in @xmath18 , with @xmath19 reflecting non - unitary evolution and `` irreversibility '' .    for a finite system",
    ", @xmath20 is at worst quasi - periodic and one can always define a recurrence time , @xmath21 .",
    "the existence of such a recurrence time reflects the fact that the information loss is in principle recoverable . in the continuum limit , @xmath22",
    ", @xmath17 is no longer quasi - periodic and @xmath23 .",
    "the phase information is then unrecoverably lost , displaced from the degrees of freedom of the system to the infintely many degrees of freedom of the environment .    to characterize the degree of decoherence one can consider the size of the fluctuations of @xmath17 around its time - averaged mean value @xmath24 : & = &",

    "= 3.5in=2.5 in    = 3.5in=2.85 in    we consider the problem of experimentally simulating quantum decoherence in a physical setting in which limited quantum resources are available for modeling the quantum environment . by `` simulating quantum decoherence ''",
    "we are referring not only to the challenge of implementing an arbitrary open - system trajectory on a qip device , but also to the study of the decoherence processes that result from specific system - environment couplings ( for example , derived from a model of some physical system of interest ) .",
    "as in zurek s model the exclusive direct mechanism for system decoherence in our model is the coupling between the system and a local quantum environment through a fixed bilinear hamiltonian .",
    "however our model of decoherence has two distinct features from the model described above .",
    "the first difference is a constraint on the hilbert space size derived from practical considerations : we allow the dimension of the hilbert space for the local quantum environment to be no larger than @xmath0 , where @xmath26 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the system . in this way",
    "the quantum environment is the smallest size that will enable the implementation of an arbitary completely positive map on the system through a unitary operator on the combined system and environment . to remove the information from our finite quantum environment we include a stochastic classical field in our model .",
    "this strategy is designed to eliminate the quantum back - action from low dimensional environments .",
    "basically the technique consists of redressing @xcite the environment s quantum state by applying a sequence of random classical kicks to the environment qubits , and then averaging over realizations of this stochastic noise .",
    "this has the effect of scrambling the system information after it has been stored in the quantum environment through the coupling interaction .",
    "it is worth stressing that the system itself is not subjected to these classical kicks and the associated stochastic averaging .",
    "this model , and the associated method realized in this paper , is depicted schematically in fig .  1",
    ". a generalization of this method to provide a time - dependent open - system evolution , is described in the discussion and depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "as we shall show below , this scheme enables simulation of the quantum decoherence that normally arises for much larger effective environment sizes .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate the simulation of phase - damping on an nmr qip consisting of three qubits ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the nmr simulation , the system is represented by one qubit while the other two qubits represent the quantum environment . before turning to a discussion of the three - qubit experiment ,",
    "we first describe and analyze this simulation method theoretically in the simplest and solvable case of the phase - damping of a single system qubit from a single environment qubit ( also depicted in fig .  1 ) .",
    "below we introduce the essential features of this decoherence model by considering an exact solution available in the case of a one - qubit environment coupled to the system by a @xmath4 interaction . with the system and environment qubits labeled by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ,",
    "the full hamiltonian is given by @xmath29 here , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are frequencies in units of hertz .",
    "this hamiltonian includes both the self - evolution of the two qubits and their interaction . in the absence of any other interaction , the evolution operator for a time @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{u0}\\ ] ] we will consider the evolution of this system subject to a sequence of kicks that affect only the environment qubit .",
    "every kick is generated by a transverse magnetic field that rotates the environment qubit around the @xmath35-axis by an angle @xmath36 chosen randomly in the interval @xmath37 .",
    "the evolution operator for the @xmath38-th kick is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the identity matrix . in our proposed model ,",
    "the kicks are considered instantaneous , therefore the evolution for a total time @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the kick rate , can be written , @xmath44 it is useful to keep in mind that the operator @xmath45 depends also on the values of the random variables @xmath36 ( @xmath46 ) corresponding to the kick angles .    our goal is to obtain a closed expression for the reduced density matrix of the system qubit for an ensemble of realizations of the random variables @xmath36 .",
    "the density matrix for this ensemble is given by @xmath47 , \\label{rho1big}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the spread of allowed kick angles over which the @xmath36 ( @xmath46 ) are uniformly distributed .",

    "the important point is that the evolution operators for the additional @xmath56 iterations will factor as above , producing a final expression with ( conditional ) operators that act exclusively on the environment qubit .",
    "hence , we can immediately obtain the following simple form for the final density matrix of the system qubit , @xmath57 where the function @xmath58 , which we call the _ decoherence factor _ , carries all the information about the effect of the environment qubit on the system qubit , including also the trivial phases from the system s self - evolution .",

    "a convenient choice for the initial state of system and environment is one where hydrogen is in a superposition state and both carbons are in an eigenstate . by placing the methyl hydrogens in an eigenstate as well ,",
    "they can be eliminated from playing a role in the hydrogen spin dynamics .",
    "this was accomplished by using a highly selective rf pulse that irradiated a spectral line corresponding to the state ^h_xe^c1_+e^c2_+e^m_+ , where @xmath154 , @xmath155 represents hydrogen , @xmath156 carbon 1 , @xmath157 carbon 2 and @xmath158 the methyl hydrogens . for this implementation we used a @xmath159 eburp1 @xcite pulse .",
    "the spectral resolution of this pulse was @xmath160 hz and its design is such that it only generates a uniform excitation profile in the specified bandwidth .",
    "ultimately , only @xmath161th of the maximum intensity was excited . nonetheless , this yielded sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to carry out the experiments .",
    "the observed hydrogen signal corresponds to @xmath162 , and is equivalent to tracing away the carbons .",
    "the peaks of hydrogen spectrum had linewidths of @xmath163 hz . consequently , the hydrogen signals decayed very slowly and we were able to pick a @xmath145 ms portion of the absolute magnitude that remained flat within one percent .",
    "the carbon spin dynamics consisted of a series of delays interleaved with pulses . during the delays the spins evolved under the internal hamiltonian .",
    "the pulse flip angles were randomly sampled from a uniform distribution that ranged between @xmath164 to @xmath165 about the @xmath166axis .",
    "a cycletime of @xmath5 ms was defined within which the kick frequency ranged from @xmath141 kicks / cycle to @xmath142 kicks / cycle in steps of @xmath141 for a total of @xmath167 different kick frequencies .",
    "the range of the kick frequency was limited by the shortest pulse the spectrometer was capable of generating , which is @xmath168 ns . the time alloted for a sequence of one delay period followed by a pulse was given by the cycletime/(number of kicks / cycle ) .",
    "within this sequence the delay time is given by the total sequence time minus the pulse - on time .",
    "the maximum pulse - on time was @xmath167 @xmath169s which corresponded to the maximum flip angle of @xmath165 .",
    "the nutation frequency for this rf field was @xmath170hz .",
    "( compare this to the chemical shifts of the carbons which were separated by @xmath171hz ) .",
    "for a given kick frequency , the length of the series of successive sequences of delay plus pulse , generated as described above , fit the total acquistion time of @xmath145 ms .",
    "= 3.5in=2.85 in    = 3.5in=2.85 in    the experiments were run for @xmath167 different kick frequencies with an average over @xmath146 realizations .",
    "a waiting time of @xmath172s was used between successive realizations .",
    "[ decofig6 ] shows the result of the experiments .",
    "the absolute magnitude of these plots were fit to an exponential .",
    "the @xmath173 per degree of freedom for the 10 fits ranged from @xmath174 to @xmath175 .",
    "the @xmath173s fit the average decays well but do nt account for the details in the fine structure evident from the oscillations of the magnitudes . as the kick frequency increases the data demonstrates that the system is decohered faster . a plot of the decay constants as a function of kick frequency , fig .",
    "[ decofig7 ] , shows this trend clearly .",
    "the experiment results seem to exhibit revivals in the higher kick rates of fig .",
    "[ decofig7 ] .",
    "but this is due to low statistics ( see fig .",
    "[ decofig8 ] ) .",
    "we have described a method for modeling decoherence that requires only limited quantum resources , and implemented the model on an nmr qip .",
    "the key feature of the model which enables simulation of the dephasing effects and the attenutation of recurrences normally produced by a much larger quantum environment is the application of classical kicks to randomize the information in the environment states .",
    "although the quantum system and environment dimensions are small and remain fixed , the system state exhibits an irreversible loss of coherence due to an averaging over the random realizations of kicks to the environment states . in particular ,",
    "in the case of a @xmath4 system - environment interaction we have shown that the kick frequency can be varied to control the decay rate of the phase - damping .",
    "although in this paper we have focussed on the simulation of continuous phase - damping , the model can be immediately generalized to other system - environment couplings and the resultant decoherence channels .",
    "a major advantage of this model is that it provides a procedure through which the mechanisms of decoherence can be explored using techniques currently available in nmr qip .",
    "as resources permit , the model we have described may be generalized to simulate and study a wider variety of decoherence channels and system - environment couplings .",
    "in particular , the `` nearest '' quantum environment need not be the only quantum environment . for example , in order to implement a time - varying decoherence process with a fixed set of system - environment couplings it may be advantageous to introduce an environment `` hierarchy '' ( see fig .  1 for a schematic ) .",
    "the idea here is to couple the first quantum environment to a second , larger environment ( through another set of fixed bilinear couplings ) , and so on .",
    "the dimension of the next hilbert space in the environment hierarchy may be limited to @xmath0 , where @xmath26 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the immediately smaller system . in this framework",
    "only the nearest environment remains directly coupled to the system of interest .",
    "the approximation of using stochastic classical fields to reduce unwanted back - action may then be applied to the final quantum environment , which is much more remote from the system of interest .    in conclusion , we have developed a model that is practical for simulating quantum decoherence effects associated with a time - independent superoperator on a qip device . by varying the phase kicking rate in the stochastic hamiltonian",
    "we can control the system s phase - damping rate . in this presentation",
    "we have shown the effectiveness of the methodolgy , in the case of one and two spin environments , using analytical solutions , numerical simulations , and a physical implementation on an nmr qip device .",
    "these methods have illustrated the use of stochastic kick rates on the quantum environment for controlling system decoherence rates and recurrence times .",
