    "the upcoming proton - lead ( p+pb ) collisions at the lhc will provide crucial benchmarks for understanding the characteristic of quark gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions at the lhc and rhic . moreover , p+a collisions run has its own merits , namely it can be vital testing grounds for novel nontrivial qcd dynamics which otherwise it can not be unambiguously explored .",
    "it is generally believed that a system of partons ( gluons ) at high energy ( or small bjorken - x ) forms a new state of matter where the gluon distribution saturates and non - linear coherence phenomena dominate @xcite .",
    "such a system is endowed with a new dynamical momentum scale , the so - called saturation scale which controls the main characteristic of the particle production .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach was proposed as a framework to study small - x and saturation physics @xcite .",
    "the cgc formalism is an effective perturbative ( weak - coupling ) qcd theory in which one systematically re - sums quantum corrections which are enhanced by large logarithms of 1/x and also incorporates high gluon density effects which are important at small x and for large nuclei , for a review see e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "the cgc formalism has been successfully applied to many processes in high energy collisions .",
    "examples are structure functions ( inclusive and diffractive ) in deeply inelastic scattering of electrons on protons or nuclei , and particle production in proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic , see ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "the observed suppression of the single inclusive hadron production in deuteron - nucleus collisions ( d+a ) at forward rapidities at rhic @xcite is perhaps among the most spectacular evidence of the qcd gluon saturation .",
    "there are , however , alternative phenomenological approaches which describe the same data .",
    "therefore , the upcoming p+a run at the lhc which covers a much wider kinematic region , can provide a unique opportunity to understand the underlying dynamics of particle production at small x.    the key ingredient of the particle production at leading logarithmic accuracy which captures the main saturation dynamics is the universal color dipole cross - section , the imaginary part of the quark - antiquark scatterings amplitude .",
    "it is universal , in a sense that for different processes , the cross - section can be written in terms of the same object , see e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "it has been recently proven that in the large-@xmath2 limit , all multi - particle production processes in the collision of a dilute system off a dense ( e.g , p+a collisions ) can , up to all orders in the strong - coupling , be described in terms of only dipoles and quadrupoles ( quadrupoles can be also approximated to dipoles ) @xcite .",
    "the color - dipole amplitude satisfies the jalilian - marian - iancu - mclerran - weigert - leonidov - kovner ( jimwlk ) evolution equations @xcite . in the large @xmath2 limit ,",
    "the coupled jimwlk equations are simplified to the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , a closed - form equation for the rapidity evolution of the dipole amplitude .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment , we do not know how to deal with impact - parameter dependence of the bk ( or jimwlk ) evolution equation @xcite , and impact - parameter dependence of the dipole amplitude is generally ignored .",
    "another current drawback is that numerical solutions of the full next - to - leading logarithmic expressions @xcite are not yet available , only running coupling corrections to the leading log kernel have been considered in phenomenological applications , the so - called running - coupling bk equation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bk evolution only provides the rapidity / energy evolution of the dipole , the initial profile of the dipole amplitude and its parameters still need to be modeled and constrained by experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , the current world - wide small - x data are very limited , and can not uniquely fix the initial parameters of the dipole amplitude @xcite .",
    "this problem is more severe for determining dipole scattering amplitude on nuclear target .",
    "this leads to rather large unavoidable theoretical uncertainties for various cgc predictions in p+a collisions at the lhc . here",
    ", we propose a simple scheme in which one can overcome this problem and still test the model at the lhc .    in this letter",
    ", we provide a compilation of various predictions for p+pb collisions at @xmath0 tev at different rapidities based on the cgc approach .",
    "this includes the total charged hadron multiplicity distribution at different centralities , nuclear modification factor for single inclusive charged hadron production , nuclear modification factor for single inclusive prompt photon production ( and direct photon production ) , and azimuthal photon - hadron correlations .",
    "these observables have been already studied in the cgc framework but at different energies at the lhc , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4 tev @xcite .",
    "here we also extend the previous studies by quantifying theoretical uncertainties coming from our freedom to choose different values for the factorization scale @xmath5 , the strong - coupling @xmath6 , and initial saturation scale of proton and nucleus .",
    "in the cgc approach , the gluon jet production in p+a collisions can be described by @xmath7-factorization @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath2 being the number of colors , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transverse - momentum and rapidity of the produced gluon jet with @xmath13 being the nucleon - nucleon center of mass energy .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the unintegrated gluon density and is the probability to find a gluon that carries @xmath15 fraction of energy with @xmath7 transverse momentum in the projectile ( or target ) a. the unintegrated gluon density is related to the color dipole forward scattering amplitude , [ m2 ] ^g_a(x_i;_t)= d^2 b_td^2 r_t e^i _ t_t^2_t _ a(x_i ; r_t ; b_t ) , with notation [ m3 ] _",
    "a(x_i ; r_t ; b_t ) = 2 _ f(x_i ; r_t ; b_t ) - ^2_f(x_i ; r_t ; b_t ) , where @xmath16 denotes the dipole transverse size and @xmath17 is the impact parameter of the scattering . throughout this paper , the subscript @xmath18 stands for the transverse component . for the value of strong - coupling @xmath6",
    "we employ the running coupling prescription used in refs .",
    "namely , in we replace @xmath6 by @xmath19 , and in we replace @xmath6 by @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the saturation scale in the projectile or target @xcite .",
    "the most important ingredient of the @xmath7 factorization which encodes the saturation dynamics is the fundamental ( or adjoint ) dipole amplitude , the imaginary part of the forward quark anti - quark scattering amplitude on a proton or nucleus target @xmath22 .",
    "the dipole cross - section can be computed via the perturbative nonlinear small - x balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) quantum evolution equation @xcite , see below .",
    "note that the @xmath7 factorization has been proven at the leading log approximation for scatterings of a dilute system on a dense one ( such as proton - nucleus collisions ) and includes bfkl type gluon emissions with gluon fusion effects between the projectile and target , and also gluon radiations from the produced gluons @xcite .",
    "this formulation has been independently verified by many authors , see e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "the rapidity distribution of the inclusive mini - jet production can be calculated from , [ po1 ] = d^2 p_t h [ , p_t , m_jet ] , where @xmath23 is the pseudorapidity and @xmath24 $ ] is the jacobian which takes account of the difference between rapidity @xmath12 and the measured pseudorapidity @xmath23 @xcite . in the above , we introduced a @xmath25-factor to effectively incorporate the missing higher - order corrections .",
    "@xmath26 is the average interaction area which depends on the kinematics and is related to the average impact parameter of the inclusive production of the mini - jet @xcite . by introducing mini - jet mass @xmath27 which mimics the pre - hadronization effect , one can regularize the infrared divergences of the @xmath7 factorization cross - section @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to relate the mini - jet yield to the produced hadron , we employ the so - called local parton - hadron duality principle @xcite assuming that the form of the rapidity distribution will not be distorted by the jet decay and only a numerical factor will differ the mini - jet spectrum from the hadron one .",
    "note that the main contribution of the integrand in comes from low transverse momentum ( typically less than @xmath28 gev ) , therefore using fragmentation function is less justifiable .    in the @xmath7-factorized approach , partons in both the projectile and target are assumed to be at very small @xmath29 in order the cgc formalism and small - x resummation to be applicable to both the projectile and target .",
    "this approach is valid as long as one stays away from the projectile fragmentation region .",
    "however , for the projectile fragmentation region at forward collisions , an alternative approach was developed in  @xcite , the so - called hybrid approach , which is better suited where one treats the projectile wave - function perturbatively within the standard collinear factorization approach using the standard dglap picture while treating the target by cgc methods .",
    "the cross section for single inclusive hadron production at leading twist approximation , in asymmetric collisions such as p+a ones , in the cgc formalism is given by  @xcite , @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\alpha_s^{in } } { 2\\pi^2 } \\int_{x_f}^1 \\frac{dz}{z^2}\\frac{z^4}{p_t^4}\\int_{k_t^2<q^2}d^2k_t k_t^2 n_f(k_t , x_2)\\int_{x_1}^1\\frac{d\\xi}{\\xi}\\sigma_{i , j = q,\\bar q , g}w_{i / j}(\\xi)p_{i / j}(\\xi)x_1f_j(\\frac{x_1}{\\xi } , q)d_{h / i}(z , q)\\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 behind the inelastic term is the qcd strong - coupling and denoted by subscript `` @xmath32 '' in order to be different with the strong - coupling @xmath6-running in the rcbk equation .",
    "note that in the hybrid formulation given above , in principle the strong coupling in the projectile which is in dilute regime can be different from the one in the rcbk description of dense target .",
    "the scale of @xmath31 can not be determined at its current approximation , and for that a full calculation upto nnlo is required .",
    "we will later consider the implication of various values for @xmath33 .",

    "the expersion given in can be understood in a simple intuitive picture .",
    "the first two terms correspond to elastic contribution , namely an incoming parton scatters elastically with the cgc target .",
    "this incoming parton with initial zero transverse momentum picks up transverse momentum of order saturation scale after multiple scatterings on the dense target .",
    "the last term in gives the inelastic contribution to the inclusive hadron production .",
    "namely , the projectile parton can also interact with target inelastically with small transfer momentum exchanges .",
    "this decoheres the pre - existing high-@xmath11 parton from the hadron wave function and releases it as an on - shell particle .",
    "these high-@xmath11 partons in the projectile wave function arise due to dglap splitting of partons .    in above",

    "the dipole forward scattering amplitude incorporates small - x dynamics and can be calculated via the running - coupling bk ( rcbk ) evolution equation .",

    "the semi - inclusive photon - hadron production in proton - nucleus collisions can be obtained from partonic cross - section by convolution of quark and antiquark distribution functions of a proton and the quark - hadron fragmentation function , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the transverse momentum of the produced hadron . a summation over the quark and antiquark flavors in the above expression should be understood .",
    "the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath75 in eqs.([cs],[qh - f ] ) are related to the transverse momenta and rapidities of the produced hadron and prompt photon via @xcite , @xmath76",
    "we first present our results for the total charged hadron multiplicity distribution in p+pb collisions at @xmath82 tev .",
    "the details of the calculation can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "our results is consistent with predictions given in ref.@xcite at 4.4 tev for minimum - bias collisions . here",
    ", we quantify the theoretical errors and provide predictions at 5.02 tev at different centralities .",
    "the main input in the @xmath7 factorization for calculating the multiplicity is the dipole forward amplitude which we take the b - cgc saturation model @xcite .",
    "this model explicitly depends on the impact - parameter and approximately incorporates all known features of small - x physics and describes the small - x data at hera including diffractive data @xcite , as well as rhic and the lhc data at small - x @xcite .",
    "we have only two free parameters here , the mini - jet mass and the over - all normalization factor in which are fixed at lower energy - factor , a factor due to parton - hadron duality and a factor to relate the interaction area to the average impact - parameter of interaction . ] @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these two parameters can not be uniquely fixed , because the error bars in experimental data for multiplicity at lower energy is rather large , and moreover , there is a correlation between these two parameters .",
    "these uncertainties are carefully quantified and shown in .",
    "the same setup provides excellent description of charged hadron multiplicity distribution in p+a collisions at rhic at different centralities over a wide range of rapidity and also in p+p and a+a collisions at the lhc and lower energies @xcite .    in ( curves labeled by b - cgc ) ,",
    "we show the charged hadron multiplicity in p+pb collisions at 5.02 tev for various centralities @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and minimum - bias , obtained from the @xmath7 factorization using the b - cgc saturation model .",
    "the impact - parameter dependence of the saturation model is crucial here for defining the centrality of the collisions . in",
    ", it is seen that the multiplicity distribution has the biggest asymmetry for more central collisions while for peripheral collisions like for example at @xmath86 centrality cut , the system becomes more similar to p+p collisions , and this fact is reflected in the total charged hadron multiplicity distribution .",
    "this effect can be more clearly seen in left panel in .",
    "note that in all predictions shown in , we assumed a fixed mini - jet mass @xmath87 mev for all energies / rapidity and centralities . as we already pointed out , the mini - jet mass is related to pre - hadronization / hadronization stage and can not be obtained from saturation physics , and it was fixed via a fit to lower energy minimum - bias data .",
    "unfortunately , for very peripheral collisions where the system becomes more like p+p collisions ( or symmetric ) , this assumption is less reliable .",
    "more importantly , one should also note that we used the @xmath7 factorization which is only proven for asymmetric collisions like p+a collisions at small - x , therefore for more peripheral collisions the current cgc prescription is less reliable .",
    "the upcoming experimental measurements of the charged hadron multiplicity at different centralities at the lhc can provide vital information about the impact - parameter dependence of the saturation scale .",
    "this can be also considered as a non - trivial test of underlying dynamics of gluon saturation , as the system at different centralities evolves from an asymmetric to more symmetric form and the total charged hadron multiplicity changes significantly , roughly speaking , up to a factor of about two compared to minimum - bias collisions , see .",
    "tev at various centralities , in right panel , from top to down : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , minimum - bias , @xmath85 , @xmath86 . left panel : for a better comparison , we show again theoretical curves for more peripheral centrality bins ( the theoretical curves in both panels are the same ) . the theoretical uncertainties of about @xmath88 due to fixing the over - all normalization at rhic are also shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=8 ]   tev at various centralities , in right panel , from top to down : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , minimum - bias , @xmath85 , @xmath86",

    "however , one should bear in mind that the @xmath7 factorization has been proven only at leading log approximation for a scatterings of a dilute partonic system on a dense one such as p+a collisions at high - energy @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", it has been already shown that in the case of dense - dense collisions such as a+a central collisions it is not valid @xcite . in ref.@xcite , we showed that the gluon - decay cascade in pre - hadronization in the so - called mlla ( modified leading logarithmic approximation ) regime which has a different kinematics compared to the bfkl type gluon emission , gives rise to extra energy - dependence .",
    "although this should be still considered as initial - state effect , it is closely related to the open question of how to accommodate the fragmentation processes in the @xmath7 factorization formalism . in ref.@xcite , we extracted gluon - jet decay cascade from @xmath89 annihilation data and we showed that the energy - dependence of about @xmath90 due to gluon - decay cascade is exactly what explains the different power - law energy - dependence of hadron multiplicities in a+a compared to p+p collisions at the lhc .",
    "this effect is more important for a+a collisions at high energy where the saturation scale is larger and consequently the average transverse momentum of the jet becomes larger than 1 gev .",
    "the mlla gluon decay cascade enhances the hadron multiplicity about @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "a comparison of various predictions coming from different saturation models for the charged hadron multiplicity in minimum - bias p+a collisions at 4.4 tev , can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the upcoming p+a collisions at the lhc can in principle discriminate between different approaches and put more constrain on saturation models .",
    "next we provide our prediction for spectra of the single inclusive hadron and prompt photon production in terms of the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 defined as follows , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of binary proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "we take @xmath94 in minimum - bias p+pb collisions at @xmath0 tev @xcite . in order to compare our @xmath1 predictions with experimental data",
    ", one needs to rescale our theoretical curves by matching the normalization @xmath93 to the experimental value .",
    "we will use the nlo mstw 2008 pdfs @xcite and the nlo kkp ffs @xcite for neutral pion and charged hadrons . for the photon fragmentation function",
    ", we will use the full leading log parametrization @xcite .",
    "we assume the factorization scale @xmath5 in the ffs and the pdfs to be equal . in order to investigate the uncertainties associated with the choice of the hard - scale @xmath5 , we consider various cases of @xmath95 and @xmath96 for inclusive hadron production and prompt photon production eqs.([pho2],[pho4 ] ) , respectively .",
    "solving the rcbk equation ( [ bk1 ] ) in the presence of the impact - parameter is still an open problem .",
    "however , for the minimum - bias analysis considered here the impact - parameter dependence may be less important .",
    "then , the initial saturation scale @xmath57 should be considered as an impact - parameter averaged value and it is extracted from the minimum - bias data . the main input in the rcbk evolution equation is the initial dipole profile with two unknown parameters @xmath57 and @xmath56 . the current hera and",
    "rhic data alone are not enough to uniquely fix the values of @xmath97 and @xmath56 , namely there exists several parameter sets of ( @xmath97 , @xmath56 ) which all provide a good description of the data @xcite . however , the recent lhc data on p+p collisions for spectra of the inclusive hadron production provided more constrains on the values of @xmath97 and @xmath56 .",
    "it was recently shown that @xmath98 with @xmath99 provides a good description of the small - x data at the lhc , hera and rhic with a proton target @xcite , see also ref.@xcite .",
    "we will take these values for the rcbk description of the projectile proton .",
    "having known the rcbk description of the proton , now we should determine the rcbk description of a nucleus .",
    "in the cgc picture , at high - energy or small - x , there is no difference between a proton and nucleus except in their saturation scale .",
    "obviously in the case of the nucleus , the impact - parameter dependence is more important .",
    "given that the perturbative rcbk evolution equation does not incorporate non - perturbative confinement effect @xcite and the b - dependent solution of the bk equation is not yet known , it seems like we are doomed to go beyond the current cgc framework and add several model assumptions . here",
    ", we stay in the standard cgc framework without invoking any extra ingredient to the model .",
    "our only assumption is that like in the case of proton , the initial saturation scale of a nucleus @xmath100 is an impact - parameter averaged value and can be extracted from other reactions with nuclear targets . in our approach , the role of the fluctuations on particle production and all other possible non - perturbative effects are effectively incorporated into the average value of @xmath100 extracted from experimental data .",
    "then we assume that the small - x evolution ( the bk or jimwlk equations ) will not be altered due to non - perturbative soft physics .",
    "for the minimum - bias collisions , it is generally assumed that the initial saturation scale of a nucleus with atomic mass number a , scales linearly with @xmath101 @xcite , namely we have @xmath102 where the parameter @xmath103 can be fixed via a fit to data . in ref.@xcite , it was shown that new muon collaboration s ( nmc ) data at small - x can be described with @xmath104 .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that rhic inclusive hadron production data in minimum - bias deuteron - gold ( d+a ) collisions and dis data for heavy nuclear targets can be described with @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that rhic and dis data on heavy nuclear target are very limited in number of data points with rather large errors .",
    "most importantly , rhic data in d+a collisions at forward rapidities and nuclear dis data at small - x are limited in kinematics to low transverse momenta ( and low virtualities ) , about @xmath106 gev . at high @xmath11",
    ", we expect that @xmath107 .",
    "assuming that in high - energy collisions at high-@xmath11 ( @xmath108 gev ) we are still in the saturation region ( which can be the case at the lhc ) , then by making use of the @xmath7 factorization or hybrid formalism , at high-@xmath11 we approximately have , @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are effective interaction area in p+a and p+p collisions , respectively .",
    "this leads to the same relation as in , but with @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , for heavy nuclei ( with @xmath113 ) , the initial nuclear saturation scale can vary within : @xmath114 we recall that the initial saturation scale of proton extracted from hera data is rather small @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the upper limit of the initial saturation scale of lead nucleus is about @xmath116 which is consistent with phenomenological saturation models based on rhic and hera data , see ref.@xcite and references therein . in",
    ", it seems as if we made an assumption at which value of @xmath29 we will have @xmath107 .",
    "however , the assumed value of @xmath117 will not affect the inequality given in in saturation region .",
    "in other words , because the speed of the rcbk evolution in rapidity is the same for both proton and nucleus , the inequality given in should be also valid at @xmath54 .",

    "moreover , the small - x evolution washes away the cronin - type peak at low-@xmath11 at all rapidities .",
    "therefore , observation of a strong cronin - type peak in p+pb collisions at the lhc , regardless if it is enhancement or suppression , can be potentially a signal of non - cgc physics , and it will be difficult to accommodate this feature in the cgc approach at current accuracy , see also refs.@xcite .    in figs.([rp - p],[rp - p2 ] ) , we show our predictions for the nuclear modification @xmath139 of direct photon and single inclusive prompt photon production in minimum - bias p+pb collisions at 5 tev at various rapidities obtained from eqs.([pho2],[pho4 ] ) with solutions of the rcbk with different initial saturation scale for nucleus .",

    "this is what one may expect in our picture since direct photon cross - section in probes the target structure function at lower transverse momentum @xmath141 and consequently lower x than the fragmentation part .",

    "nevertheless , it is seen from that depending on the value of @xmath100 , the rcbk and the iim saturation model provide different suppression for inclusive prompt photon production in minimum - bias p+a collisions at the lhc .",
    "note that similar to the inclusive hadron production , the cgc approach generally gives larger suppression for inclusive prompt photon @xmath139 at forward rapidities compared to collinear factorization results @xcite .    in",

    "however , in the presence of inelastic contribution ( @xmath144 ) , the choice of hard - scale @xmath5 becomes important and it leads to a sizable effect for the @xmath129 , see .",
    "the sensitivity of the nuclear modification factor @xmath145 and @xmath136 to the hard - scale @xmath5 ( and the strong - coupling @xmath33 ) clearly indicates that the higher - order corrections should be important .",
    "note that for the case of inclusive hadron production , the full nlo corrections to the hybrid formalism has been recently calculated @xcite , but yet to be employed for phenomenological purpose .",
    "some words of caution are in order here .",
    "our formulation is valid for asymmetric collisions when a projectile can be treated in the standard collinear approximation while for the target we systematically incorporated the small - x re - summation ( at the leading twist approximation ) effects .",
    "note , however , our reference for @xmath129 or @xmath139 is p+p collisions where at mid - rapidity and low transverse momentum the interacting system becomes symmetric , and therefore the cgc formulation ( both the @xmath7 factorization and the hybrid formalism ) will be less reliable .",

    "the predictions for the azimuthal angle correlations between the produced prompt photon and hadron calculated via the coincidence probability in p+a collisions at @xmath0 tev can be found in ref.@xcite .    to summarize , in this letter within the cgc / saturation framework , we provided various predictions for different observables for the upcoming p+pb collisions at @xmath0 tev at various rapidities .",
    "the main caveats of the current cgc approach are twofold , lack of systematic control of higher order corrections and lack of enough high - quality experimental data at small - x to constrain the initial dipole profile of the rcbk evolution equation .",

    "after we submitted our paper to archive , the alice collaboration released the first p+pb data from a short pilot run performed in preparation for the full p+pb physics run scheduled for the beginning of 2013 . here , we compare some of our predictions already presented in this paper with the alice preliminary data @xcite . in",

    "therefore , our freedom in choosing the value of @xmath33 in hybrid factorization formula brings rather large uncertainties .",
    "one of the most remarkable feature of the alice data for @xmath129 is the fact that data seem to rule out any ( or strong ) cronin - type peak . although , the experimental error bars are still rather large to make any firm conclusion , but if this feature of data remains intact with more precise experimental data , this can be considered as another important evidence in favor of the cgc approach as this feature was already predicted , see discussion in sec iii .",
    "the upcoming measurement of @xmath129 at forward rapidities at the lhc can be considered as a crucial further test of the cgc approach and provide undoubtedly valuable information about the saturation dynamics and the true value of the initial saturation scale of heavy nucleus @xmath100 ."
