    "he was a true disciple of sommerfeld in his clear mathematical craftsmanship .",
    "by example and sharp criticism he constantly tried to maintain a similarly high standard in the work of other theoretical physicists . he was often called the living conscience of theoretical physicists . _",
    "( @xcite , vol.1 , p.viii ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it seems plausible that this critical impregnation dates back to his school - days , when young pauli read , for example , ernst mach s critical analysis of the historical development of the science of mechanics , a copy of which pauli received as a present from his godfather ( mach ) at around the age of fourteen .",
    "mach s `` mechanik '' , as this book is commonly called , starts out with a discussion of archimedes law of the lever , thereby criticising the following symmetry consideration ( @xcite , p.11 - 12 ) : imagine two equal masses , @xmath2 , and a perfectly stiff and homogeneous rod of length @xmath3 , both being immersed into a static homogeneous vertical gravitational field , where the rod is suspended at its midpoint , @xmath4 , from a point @xmath5 above ; see fig.[fig : lawoflever ] .",
    "what happens if we attach the two equal masses to the ends of the rod and release them simultaneously without initial velocity ?",
    "an immediate symmetry argument suggests that it stays horizontal ; it might be given as follows : everything just depends on the initial geometry and distribution of masses , which is preserved by a reflection at the plane perpendicular to the rod through @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that after release the rod dropped at one side of the suspension point @xmath4 , then the mirror image of that process would have the same initial condition with the rod dropping to the other side .",
    "this is a contradiction if the laws governing the process are assumed to be reflection symmetric and deterministic ( unique outcome for given initial condition ) .",
    "this argument seems rigorous and correct .",
    "now , how does one get from here to the law of the lever ?",
    "the argument criticised by mach is as follows : assume that the condition for equilibrium depends only on the amount of mass and its suspension point on the rod , but not on its shape .",
    "then we may replace the mass to the left of @xmath4 by two masses of half the amount each on a small rod in equilibrium , as shown in the second ( upper right ) picture .",
    "then replace the suspension of the small rod by two strings attached to the left arm of the original rod , as shown in the third ( lower left ) picture , and observe that the right one is just under the suspension point @xmath4 , so that it does not disturb the equilibrium if it were cut away as in the last ( lower right ) picture of fig.[fig : lawoflever ] .",
    "( -42.5,7)@xmath2 ( -112.5,7)@xmath2 ( -77,27)@xmath4 ( -75,68)@xmath5    @xmath6     +    @xmath7    the weak point in the argument is clearly the transition from the second to the third picture : there is no _ global _ symmetry connecting them , even though locally , i.e. regarding the small rod only , it connects two equilibrium positions .",
    "it is easy to see that , in fact , the assumption that a global equilibrium is maintained in this change is _ equivalent _ to archimedes law of the lever .",
    "this example shows ( in admittedly a fairly trivial fashion ) that alleged symmetry properties can work as a _ petitio principii _ for the law to be derived .",
    "this is essentially the criticism of mach .",
    "the reason why we consider this ` derivation ' of the law of the lever to be a _",
    "petitio principii _ is that we have other , physically much more direct ways to actually derive it from _ dynamical _ first principles . from that point of view",
    "the alleged symmetry is to be regarded as an artifact of the particular law and certainly not vice versa .",
    "the observed symmetry requires an explanation in terms of the dynamical laws , which themselves are to be established in an independent fashion .",
    "this is how we look upon , say , the symmetry of crystals or the symmetric shape of planetary orbits .    on the other hand ,",
    "all fundamental dynamical theories of 20th century physics are motivated by symmetry requirements .",
    "they are commonly looked at as particularly simple realisations of the symmetries in question , given certain _ a priori _ assumptions .",
    "it is clear that , compared to the previous example , there are different concepts of symmetry invoked here .",
    "however , there also seems to be a shift in attitude towards a more abstract understanding of ` physical laws ' in general .",
    "what makes pauli an interesting figure in this context is that this shift in attitude can be traced in his own writings .",
    "consider special relativity as an example , thereby neglecting gravity .",
    "one may ask : what is the general relation between the particular symmetry ( encoded by the poincar group ) of spacetime and that very same symmetry of the fundamental interactions ( weak , strong , and electromagnetic , but not gravity ) ?",
    "is one to be considered as logically prior to the other ?",
    "for example , if we take einstein s original operationalist attitude , we would say that the geometry of spacetime is defined through the behaviour of ` rods ' and ` clocks ' , which eventually should be thought of as physical systems obeying the fundamental dynamical laws .",
    "in fact , einstein often complained about the fact that rods and clocks are introduced as if they were logically independent of the dynamical laws , e.g. , in a discussion remark at the 86th meeting of the gesellschaft deutscher naturforscher und rzte in bad nauheim in 1920 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it is a logical shortcoming of the theory of relativity in its present form to be forced to introduce measuring rods and clocks separately instead of being able to construct them as solutions to differential equations . _",
    "( @xcite , vol.7 , doc.46 , p.353 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    from that viewpoint , symmetry properties of spacetime are nothing but an effective codification of the symmetries of the fundamental laws",
    ". consequences like ` length contraction ' and ` time dilation ' in special relativity are then only _ effectively _ described as due to the geometry of spacetime , whereas a fundamental explanation clearly has to refer to the dynamical laws that govern clocks and rods .",
    "this was clearly the attitude taken by h.a.lorentz and h.poincar , though in their case still somehow afflicted with the idea of a material ther that , in principle , defines a preferred rest frame , so that the apparent validity of the principle of relativity must be interpreted as due to a ` dynamical conspiracy . ' in his famous article on relativity for the encyclopedia of mathematical sciences , the young pauli proposes to maintain this view , albeit without the idea on a material ther .",

    "we think that the answer to this question should be no .",
    "the contraction of a measuring rod is not an elementary but a very complicated process .",

    "the term ` symmetry ' is used in such a variety of meanings , even in physics , that it seems appropriate to recall some of its its main aspects .",
    "one aspect is that which mathematicians call an ` automorphism ' and which basically means a ` structure preserving self - map ' .",
    "take as an example ( conceptually not an easy one ) the modern notion of spacetime .",
    "first of all it is a set , @xmath2 , the members of which are events , or better , ` potential events ' , since we do not want to assume that every spacetime point to be an actual physical event in the sense that a material happening is taking place , or at least not one which is dynamically relevant to the problem at hand .",
    "that set is endowed with certain structures which are usually motivated through operational relations of actual physical events .",
    "one such structure could be that of a preferred set of paths , which represent inertial ( i.e. force free ) motions of ` test bodies ' , that is , localised objects which do not react back onto spacetime structure .",
    "this defines a so - called ` path - structure ' ( compare @xcite@xcite ) , which in the simplest case reduces to an _ affine structure _ in which the preferred paths behave , intuitively speaking , like ` straight lines ' .",
    "this can clearly be said in a much more precise form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . under very mild technical assumptions ( not even involving continuity ) one",
    "may then show that the only automorphisms of that ` inertial structure ' can already be narrowed down to the inhomogeneous galilei or lorentz groups , possibly supplemented by constant scale transformations ( cf .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "another structure to start with could have been that of a causal relation on @xmath2 .",
    "that is , a partial order relation which determines the pairs of points on spacetime which , in principle , could influence each other in form of a propagation process based on ordinary matter or light signals .",
    "the automorphism group of that structure is then the subgroup of bijections on @xmath2 that , together with their inverse , preserve this order relation .",
    "for example , in case of minkowski space , where the causal relation is determined by the light - cone structure , it may be shown that the most general automorphism is given by a poincar transformation plus a constant rescaling@xcite@xcite . since , according to klein s _ erlanger programm _",
    "@xcite , any geometry may be characterised by its automorphism group , the geometry of minkowski space is , up to constant rescalings , entirely encoded in the causal relations .",
    "the same result can be arrived at through topological considerations .",
    "observers ( idealised to be extensionless ) move in spacetime on timelike curves .",
    "take the set @xmath9 of all ( not necessarily smooth ) timelike curves which are continuous in the standard ( euclidean ) topology @xmath10 of minkowski spacetime @xmath2 .",
    "now endow @xmath2 with a new topology , @xmath11 , called the _ path topology _ , which is the finest topology on @xmath2 which induces the same topology on each path in @xmath9 as the standard ( euclidean ) topology @xmath10 .",
    "the new topology @xmath11 is strictly finer than @xmath10 and has the following remarkable property : the automorphism group of @xmath12 .",
    "] , i.e. the group of bijections of @xmath2 which , together with their inverses , preserve @xmath11 , is just the poincar group extended by the constant rescalings  @xcite .",
    "this is possibly the closest operational meaning one could attribute to the topology of spacetime , since in @xmath11 a set in spacetime is open if and only if every observer `` times '' it to be open .",
    "all this is meant to illustrate that there are apparently different ways to endow spacetime with structures that are , physically speaking , more or less well motivated and which lead to the same automorphism group .",
    "that group may then be called the group of _ spacetime symmetries_. so far , this group seems to bear no direct relation to any dynamical law .",
    "however , the physical meaning of such statements of symmetry is tight to an ontological status of spacetime points .",
    "we assumed from the onset that spacetime is a _ set _ @xmath2 .",

    "hence we may ask : is a point in spacetime , a ` potential event ' as we called it earlier , a `` determined well - distinguished object of our intuition or of our thinking '' ?",
    "this question is justified even though modern axiomatic set theory is more restrictive in what may be called a set ( for otherwise it runs into the infamous antinomies ) and also stands back from any characterisation of elements in order to not confuse the axioms themselves with their possible _",
    "interpretations_. however , applications to physics require interpreted axioms , where it remains true that elements of sets are thought of as definite as in cantors original definition .",
    "but it is just this definiteness that seems to be physically unwarranted in application to spacetime .",
    "the modern general - relativistic viewpoint takes that into account by a quotient construction , admitting only those statements as physically meaningful that are invariant under the group of ( differentiable ) permutations of spacetime points .",
    "this is possible only because all other structures on spacetime , in particular the metric and with it the causal structure , are not fixed once and for all but are subsumed into the dynamical fields .",
    "hence no non - dynamical background structures remain , except those that are inherent in the definition of a differentiable manifold .",
    "the group of automorphisms is therefore the whole diffeomorphism group of spacetime , which , in some sense , comes sufficiently close to the group of all permutations .- point transitive , that is , given any two @xmath13-tuples of mutually distinct spacetime points , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , there is a diffeomorphism @xmath16 such that for all @xmath17 we have @xmath18 ; this is true for all positive integers @xmath13 . ]",
    "what is the relation between spacetime automorphisms and symmetries of dynamical laws ? before we can answer this , we have to recall what a symmetry of a dynamical law is .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us restrict attention to dynamical laws in classical ( i.e. non - quantum ) physics .",
    "the equations of motion generally take the form of systems of differential equations , which we here abbreviate with @xmath19 ( @xmath20quation of @xmath21otion ) .",
    "these equations involve two types of quantities : 1 ) background structures , collectively abbreviated here by @xmath22 , and 2 ) dynamical entities , collectively abbreviated here by @xmath23 .",
    "the former will typically be represented by geometric objects on @xmath2 ( tensor fields , connections , etc ) , which are taken from a somehow specified set @xmath24 of ` admissible backgrounds ' .",
    "typical background structures are external sources , like currents , and the geometry of spacetime in non - general - relativistic field theories .",
    "dynamical entities typically involve ` particles ' and ` fields ' , which in the simplest cases are represented by maps to and from spacetime ,    [ eq : particlefield ] @xmath25    and were @xmath26 is usually some vector space .    in order to state the equations of motion , one has to first specify a set of so - called*kinematically possible trajectories * out of which",
    "the dynamical entities @xmath23 are taken and solutions to the equations of motion are sought .",
    "usually this involves particle trajectories which are sufficiently smooth ( typically piecewise twice continuously differentiable ) and fields which are sufficiently smooth and in addition have a sufficiently rapid fall - off at large spatial distances , so as to give rise to finite quantities of energy , angular - momentum , etc .",
    "this space of kinematically possible trajectories will be denoted by @xmath27 . according to the discussion above , the equation of motion takes two arguments , one from @xmath24 the other from @xmath27 , and is hence written in the form @xmath28 where the zero on the right - hand side may be a many - component object . equation ( [ eq : eom ] )",
    "should be read as a selection criterion on the set @xmath27 , depending on the externally specified values of @xmath22 .",
    "we shall sometimes write @xmath29 for @xmath30 to denote the particular equation of motion for @xmath23 corresponding to the choice @xmath22 for the background structures .",
    "in general , the sets of solutions to ( [ eq : eom ] ) for variable @xmath22 are @xmath22-dependent subset @xmath31 , whose elements are called the    * dynamically possible trajectories*. we can now say more precisely what is usually meant by a symmetry :    [ def : symmetrygroup ] an abstract group @xmath32 is called a * symmetry group * of the equations of motion iff the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "there is an effective ( see below ) action @xmath33 of @xmath32 on the set of kinematically possible trajectories , denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "2 .   this action leaves the subset @xmath31 invariant ; that is , for all @xmath35 in @xmath32 we have : @xmath36    recall that an action is called effective if no group element other than the group identity fixes all points of the set it acts on .",
    "effectiveness is required in order to prevent mathematically trivial and physically meaningless extensions of @xmath32 .",
    "what really matters are the orbits of @xmath32 in @xmath27 , that is , the subsets @xmath37 for each @xmath38 .",
    "if the action were not effective , we could simply reduce @xmath32 to a smaller group with an effective action and the same orbits in @xmath27 , namely the quotient group @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the normal subgroup of elements that fix all points of @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noted that this definition is still very general due to the fact that no further condition is imposed on the action of @xmath32 , apart from the obvious one of effectivity .",
    "for example , for fields one usually requires the action to be ` local ' , in the sense that for any point @xmath5 of spacetime , the value @xmath41 of the @xmath35-transformed field should be determined by the value of the original field at some point @xmath42 of spacetime , and possibly _ finitely many _ derivatives of @xmath43 at @xmath42 . if there are no dependencies on the derivatives , the action is sometimes called ` ultralocal ' .",
    "note that the point @xmath42 need not be identical to @xmath5 , but it is assumed to be uniquely determined by @xmath35 and @xmath5 .",
    "a striking example of what can happen if locality is not imposed is given by the vacuum maxwell equations ( no external currents ) , which clearly admit the poincar group as ultralocally acting symmetry group .",
    "what is less well known is the fact that they also admit the inhomogeneous galilei group as symmetry group and the electric displacement - field @xmath44 on one side , and between the magnetic induction - field @xmath45 and the magnetic field @xmath46 on the other ; see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "] , albeit the action is non - local ; see @xcite or chap.5.9 of @xcite .",
    "( there are also other non - local symmetries of the vacuum maxwell equations  @xcite . )    to be strictly distinguished from the notion of symmetry is the notion of covariance , which we define as follows :    [ def : covariancegroup ] an abstract group @xmath32 is called a * covariance group * of the equations of motion iff the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "there is an effective action @xmath33 of @xmath32 on the set of kinematically possible trajectories , denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "2 .   there is also an action ( this time not necessarily effective ) @xmath47 of @xmath32 on the set of background structures , likewise denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "3 .   the solution - function @xmath49 from @xmath24 into the subsets of @xmath27 is @xmath32-equivariant .",
    "this means the following : if @xmath50 denotes the set @xmath51 , then , for all @xmath35 in @xmath32 , we have @xmath52 an alternative way to say this is that the relation that @xmath19 establishes on @xmath53 via ( [ eq : eom ] ) is @xmath32 invariant , that is , for all @xmath35 in @xmath32 , we have @xmath54    the obvious difference between ( [ eq : defsymmetry ] ) and ( [ eq : defcovariance2 ] ) is that in the former case the background structure is not allowed to change .",
    "the transformed dynamical entity is required to satisfy the _ very same _ equation as the untransformed one , whereas for a covariance it is only required to satisfy a suitably changed set of equations . here ` changed ' refers to the fact that @xmath55 is generally different from @xmath22 .",
    "hence it is clear that a symmetry group is automatically also a covariance group , by just letting it act trivially on the set @xmath24 of background structures .",
    "the precise partial converse is as follows : given a covariance group @xmath32 with action on @xmath24 , then for each @xmath56 define the ` stabiliser subgroup ' of @xmath22 in @xmath32 as the set of elements in @xmath32 that fix @xmath22 , @xmath57 then the subgroup @xmath58 of the covariance group is also a symmetry group of the equation of motion @xmath29 .",
    "the requirement of covariance is a rather trivial one , since it can always be met by suitably taking into account all the background structures and a sufficiently general action of @xmath32 on @xmath24 . to see how this works in a specific example , consider the ordinary ` heat equation ' for the temperature field @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is a dimensionful constant ) : @xmath61 let @xmath62 be the 7-parameter group of euclidean motions ( rotations and translations in @xmath63 ) and time translations , whose defining representation on spacetime ( @xmath64 ) is denoted by @xmath65 , then @xmath32 acts effectively on the set of temperature fields via @xmath66 ( the inverse being just introduced to make this a _ left _",
    "it is immediate from the structure of ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) that this implements @xmath32 as symmetry group of this equation .",
    "the background structures implicit in ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) are : a ) a preferred split of spacetime into space and time , 2 )  a preferred measure and orientation of time , and c )  a preferred distance measure on space .",
    "there are many ways to parametrise this structure , _ depending on the level of generality one starts from_. if , for example , we start from special relativity , we only list those structural elements that we need _ on top of _ the minkowski metric @xmath67 in order to write down ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) .",
    "they are given by a single constant and normalised timelike vector field @xmath13 , by means of which we can write ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) in the form @xmath68 in the special class of inertial reference frames in which @xmath69 equation ( [ eq : heateq2 ] ) reduces to ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) .",
    "from the structure of ( [ eq : heateq2 ] ) it is obvious that this equation admits the whole poincar group of special relativity as covariance group .",
    "however , the symmetry group it contains is the stabiliser subgroup of the given background structure .",
    "the latter is given by the vector field @xmath13 , whose stabiliser subgroup within the poincar group is just @xmath70 , the same as for ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) .",
    "had we started from a higher level of generality , in which no preferred coordinate systems are given to us as in special relativity , we would write the heat equation in the form @xmath71 where now @xmath13 as well as @xmath35 feature as background structures .",
    "@xmath13 is again specified as unit timelike covariant - constant vector field , @xmath35 as a flat metric , and @xmath72 as the unique covariant derivative operator associated to @xmath35 ( i.e. torsion free and preserving @xmath35 ) . since @xmath72 is here taken as a unique function of @xmath35 , it does not count as independent background structure .",
    "once again it is clear from the structure of ( [ eq : heateq3 ] ) that the covariance group is now the whole diffeomorphism group of spacetime .",
    "however , the symmetry group remains the same as before since the stabiliser subgroup of the pair @xmath73 is @xmath70 .",
    "this example should make clear how easy it is to almost arbitrarily inflate covariance groups by starting from higher and higher levels of generality and adding the corresponding extra structures into ones list of background structures .",
    "this possibility is neither surprising nor particularly disturbing .",
    "slightly more disturbing is the fact that a similar game can be played with symmetries , at least on a very formal level .",
    "the basic idea is to simply declare background structures to be dynamical ones by letting their values be determined by equations .",
    "we may do this since we have so far not qualified ` equations of motion ' as any special sort of equations . for example , in the special relativistic context we may just take ( [ eq : heateq2 ] ) and let @xmath13 be determined by @xmath74 then ( [ eq : heateq2 ] ) and ( [ eq : heateq2-suppl ] ) together define a background free ( from the special relativistic point of view ) system of equations for @xmath75 which has the full poincar group as symmetry group .",
    "its symbolic form is @xmath76 where the @xmath77 on the right - hand side has now 18 components : one for ( [ eq : heateq2 ] ) , one for the first equation in ( [ eq : heateq2-suppl ] ) , and 16 ( @xmath78 ) for the second equation in ( [ eq : heateq2-suppl ] ) .",
    "but note that its @xmath59-sector of solution space is _ not _ the same as that of ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) , as it now also contains solutions for different @xmath13 .",
    "however , as the equations ( [ eq : heateq2-suppl ] ) for @xmath13 do not involve @xmath59 , the total solution space for @xmath79 can be thought of as fibred over the space of allowed @xmath13 , with each fibre over @xmath13 being given by the solutions @xmath59 of ( [ eq : heateq2 ] ) for that given @xmath13 .",
    "each such fibre is a faithful image of the original solution space of ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) , suitably transformed by a lorentz boost that relates the original @xmath13 in ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) ( i.e. @xmath80 ) to the chosen one .",
    "even more radically , we could take ( [ eq : heateq3 ] ) and declare @xmath13 and @xmath35 to be dynamical entities obeying the extra equations @xmath81=0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the riemann curvature tensor of @xmath35 , so that the last equation in ( [ eq : heateq3-suppl ] ) just expresses flatness of @xmath35 .",
    "the system consisting of ( [ eq : heateq3 ] ) and ( [ eq : heateq3-suppl ] ) has no background structures and admits the full diffeomorphism group as symmetry group .",
    "it is of the symbolic form @xmath83 which now comprises 36 components : the 16 as above and an additional set of 20 for the independent components of @xmath82 .",
    "again , note that the @xmath59-sector of solution space of ( [ eq : heateq3 ] ) is now much bigger that of ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) of or ( [ eq : heateq2 ] ) . with any solution @xmath59 it also contains its diffeomorphism - transformed one , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 .",
    "again , since the equations for @xmath13 and @xmath35 do not involve @xmath59 , the total solution space is fibred over the allowed @xmath13 and @xmath35 fields , with each fibre corresponding to a faithful image of the original solution space for ( [ eq : heateq1 ] ) .    finally we remark that , in principle , constants appearing in equations of motion could also be addressed as background structures whose values might eventually be determined by more general dynamical theories .",
    "for example , one might speculate ( as was done some time ago in the so - called brans - dicke theories ) that the gravitational constant is actually the value of some field that only in the present epoch of our universe has settled to a spatially constant and quasi - static value , but whose value at much earlier times was significantly different .",
    "another example from quantum field theory concerns the idea that masses of elementary particles are dynamically generated by the so - called higgs field ( whose existence is strongly believed but not yet experimentally confirmed ) .    in any case ,",
    "the important message from the considerations of this subsection is the following : symmetries emerge or disappear if , respectively , background structures become dynamical ( @xmath86 ) or dynamical structures ` freeze ' ( @xmath87 ) .      within the concept of symmetry",
    "as explained so far , an important distinction must be made between _",
    "observable _ symmetries on one hand , and _ gauge _ symmetries on the other .",
    "an observable symmetry transforms a state or a history of states ( trajectory ) into a _",
    "different _ , that is , _ physically distinguishable _ state or history of states . on the other hand ,",
    "a gauge symmetry transforms a state or a history of states into a _ physically indistinguishable _ state or a history of states . in this case",
    "there is a redundancy in the mathematical description , so that the map from mathematical labels to physical states is not faithful .",
    "this is usually associated with a group , called the _ group of gauge transformations _ , denoted by @xmath88 , which acts on the set of state labels such that two such labels correspond to the same physical state iff they lie in the same orbit of @xmath88 .",
    "it is clear that the notion of ` distinguishability ' introduced here refers to the set of observables , i.e. functions on state space that are physically realisable in the widest sense .",
    "assuming for the moment that this was well defined , we could attempt a definition as follows :    [ def : observablesymmetry ] let @xmath32 be a symmetry group in the sense of definition[def : symmetrygroup ]",
    ". then @xmath89 is called an * observable or physical symmetry * iff there exists a @xmath90 and a physical observable that separates @xmath91 from @xmath23 .",
    "if no such observable exists , @xmath35 is called a * gauge symmetry*.    it is clear that for a theoretician the stipulation of what functions on state space correspond to physically realisable observables is itself of hypothetical nature . however , what is important for us at this point is merely that _ relative _ to such a stipulation the distinction between observables and gauge symmetries makes sense . in the mathematical practice gauge symmetries",
    "are often signalled by an underdeterminedness of the equations of motion , which sometimes simply fail to restrict the motion in certain degrees of freedom which are then called ` gauge degrees of freedom ' . in that case ,",
    "given any solution @xmath90 , we can obtain another solution , @xmath92 , by just changing @xmath23 in those non - determined degrees of freedom in an arbitrary way .",
    "for example , if the equations of motion are obtained via an action principle , such spurious degrees of freedom will typically reveal their nature through the property that motions in them are not associated with any action . as a result , the equations of motion , which are just the condition for the stationarity of the action , will not constrain the motion in these directions .",
    "conversely , if according to the action principle the motion in some degree of freedom costs action , it can hardly be called a redundant one . in this sense",
    "an action principle is not merely a device for generating equations of motion , but also contains some information about observables .",
    "the combination of observable and gauge symmetries into the total symmetry group @xmath32 need not at all be just that of a semi - direct or even direct product .",
    "often , in field theory , the gauge group @xmath88 is indeed a subgroup of @xmath32 , in fact an invariant ( normal ) one , but the observable symmetries , @xmath93 , are merely a quotient and not a subgroup of @xmath32 . in standard group",
    "theoretic terms one says that @xmath32 is a @xmath94extension of @xmath93 .",
    "this typically happens in electromagnetism or more generally in yang - mills type gauge theories or general relativity with globally charged configurations . in this case",
    "only the ` gauge transformations ' with sufficiently rapid fall - off at large spatial distances are proper gauge transformations in our sense , whereas the long ranging ones cost action if performed in real time and therefore have to be interpreted as elements of @xmath93 ; see e.g. @xcite and chap.6 of @xcite .",
    "this ends our small excursion into the realm of meanings of ` symmetry ' .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of specific aspects in pauli s work .",
    "the usage of symmetry concepts in pauli s work is so rich and so diverse that it seems absolutely hopeless , and also inappropriate , to try to present them in a homogeneous fashion with any claim of completeness .",
    "rather , i will comment on various subjectively selected aspects without in any way saying that other aspects are of any lesser significance . in fact , i will not include some of his most outstanding contributions , like , for example , the formulation of the exclusion principle , the neutrino hypothesis , or his anticipation of yang - mills gauge theory for the strong interaction .",
    "there exist excellent reviews and discussions of these topics in the literature .",
    "specifically i wish to refer to bartel van der waerden s contribution _ exclusion principle and spin _ to the pauli memorial volume ( @xcite , pp.199 - 244 ) , norbert straumann s recent lecture on the history of the exclusion principle  @xcite , pauli s own account of the history of the neutrino ( in english : @xcite , pp.193 - 217 ; in german : @xcite , vol.2 , pp",
    ". 1313 - 1337 and @xcite , p.156 - 180 ) , chien - shiung wu s account _ the neutrino _ in the pauli memorial volume ( @xcite , pp.249 - 303 ) , and the historical account of gauge theories by lochlainn oraifeartaigh and norbert straumann  @xcite . a non - technical overview concerning _",
    "pauli s belief in exact symmetries _ is given by karl von meyenn  @xcite .",
    "last , but clearly not least , i wish to mention charles enz s fairly recent comprehensive scientific biography @xcite of wolfgang pauli , which gives a detailed discussion of his scientific vre .    in this contribution",
    "i rather wish to concentrate on some particular aspects of the notion of symmetry that are directly related to the foregoing discussion in sections[sec : dynamicalsymmetriesversuscovariance ] and [ sec : physicalversusgaugesymmetries ] , as i feel that they are somewhat neglected in the standard discussions of symmetry .      in january 1926",
    "pauli managed to deduce the energy spectrum for the hydrogen atom from the rules of matrix mechanics .",
    "for this he implicitly used the fact that the mechanical problem of a point charge moving in a spherically symmetric force - field with a fall - off proportional to the square of the inverse distance has a symmetry group twice as large ( i.e. of twice the dimension ) as the group of spatial rotations alone , which it contains .",
    "hence the total symmetry group is made half of a ` kinematical ' part , referring to space , and half of a ` dynamical ' part , referring to the specific force law ( @xmath95 fall - off ) .",
    "their combination is a proper physical symmetry group that transforms physically distinguishable states into each other . in the given quantum - mechanical context",
    "one also speaks of ` spectrum generating ' symmetries .",
    "let us recall the classical problem in order to convey some idea where the symmetries and their associated conserved quantities show up , and how they may be employed to solve the dynamical problem .",
    "consider a mass - point of mass @xmath4 and position coordinate @xmath96 in the force field @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the length of @xmath96 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is some dimensionful constant .",
    "then , according to newton s 3rd law ( an overdot stands for the time derivative ) , @xmath101 next to energy , there are three obvious conserved quantities corresponding to the three components of the angular - momentum vector ( here written per unit mass ) @xmath102 but there are three more conserved quantities , corresponding to the components of the following vector ( today called the lenz - runge vector ) , @xmath103 conservation can be easily verified by differentiation of ( [ eq : lenzrungevect ] ) using ( [ eq : eqmotsphsympot ] ) and @xmath104 . hence on has ( @xmath105 = length of @xmath106 ) @xmath107 from which the classical orbit immediately follows : setting @xmath108 , the last equation ( [ eq : conicsection1 ] ) reads @xmath109 which is the well known equation for a conic section in the plane perpendicular to @xmath106 , focus at the origin , eccentricity @xmath110 (= length of @xmath111 ) , and _",
    "latus rectum _ @xmath112 .",
    "the vector @xmath111 points from the origin to the point of closest approach ( periapsis ) .",
    "the few steps leading to this conclusion illustrate the power behind the method of working with conservation laws which , in turn , rests on an effective exploitment of symmetries .",
    "the total energy per unit mass is given by @xmath113 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath114 which allows to express @xmath115 as function of the invariants @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this is the relation which pauli shows to have an appropriate matrix analogue , where it allows to express the energy in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrices for @xmath117 and @xmath116 which pauli determines , leading straight to the balmer formula .",
    "from a modern point of view one would say that , for fixed energy @xmath118 , one obtains a hamiltonian action of @xmath119 . ]",
    "the state space of this problem carries a hamiltonian action of the lie algebra @xmath120 , generated by the 3 + 3 quantities @xmath106 and @xmath111 .",
    "quantisation then consists in the problem to represent this lie algebra as a commutator algebra of self - adjoint operators and the determination of spectra of certain elements in the enveloping algebra .",
    "this is what pauli did , from a modern point of view , but clearly did not realise at the time .",
    "in particular , even though he calculated the commutation relations for the six quantities @xmath106 and @xmath111 , he did not realise that they formed the lie algebra for @xmath120 , as he frankly stated much later ( 1955 ) in his address on the occasion of hermann weyl s 70th birthday : , p.402 ) note that , in modern terminology , pauli actually refers to a representation of the _ lie algebra _ of the orthogonal group . ]    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ similarly i did not know that the matrices which i had derived from the new quantum mechanics in order to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom were a representation of the 4-dimensional orthogonal group .",

    "in a cern - report of 1956 , pauli returned to the representation - theoretic side of this problem  @xcite .",
    "the first big impact of group theory proper on physics took place in quantum theory , notably through the work or eugene wigner  @xcite and hermann weyl  @xcite .",
    "while in atomic spectroscopy the usage of group theory could be looked upon merely as powerful mathematical tool , it definitely acquired a more fundamental flavour in ( quantum ) field theory .",
    "according to a dictum usually attributed to wigner , every elementary system ( particle ) in special - relativistic quantum theory corresponds to a unitary irreducible representation of the poincar group .",
    "in fact , all the poincar invariant linear wave equations on which special - relativistic quantum theory is based , known by the names of klein & gordon , weyl , dirac , maxwell , proca , rarita & schwinger , bargmann & wigner , pauli & fierz , can be understood as projection conditions that isolate an irreducible sub - representation of the poincar group , or sometimes an extension thereof by the discrete transformations of space and time reversal . ] within a reducible one that is easy to write down .",
    "more concretely , the latter is usually obtained as follows : take a field @xmath43 on spacetime @xmath2 with values in a finite - dimensional complex vector space @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath121 be a finite - dimensional irreducible representation of the ( double cover of the ) lorentz group @xmath122 on @xmath26 .",
    "is never unitary , simply because the lorentz group has no non - trivial finite - dimensional unitary irreducible representations .",
    "but it will give rise to an infinite - dimensional representation on the linear space of fields @xmath43 which will indeed be unitary . ]",
    "it is uniquely labelled by a pair @xmath123 of two positive integer- or half - integer - valued numbers . in the standard terminology",
    ", @xmath124 corresponds to the number of unprimed , @xmath125 to the number of primed spinor indices of @xmath43 .",
    "the set of such fields furnishes a linear representation of the ( double cover of the ) poincar group , @xmath126 , where the action of the group element @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 or for the fourier transform @xmath129 , @xmath130 one immediately infers from ( [ eq : actiononfield - ft ] ) that irreducibility implies that @xmath129 must have support on a single @xmath122 orbit in momentum space .",
    "here one usually restricts to those orbits consisting of non - spacelike @xmath5 ( those with spacelike @xmath5 give rise to the tachyonic representations which are deemed unphysical ) , which are labelled by @xmath131 with non - negative @xmath4 . for @xmath43",
    "this means that it obeys the klein - gordon equation @xmath132 .",
    "this is already half the way to an irreducible representation , insofar as it now contains only modes of fixed mass .",
    "but these modes still contains several spins up to the maximal value @xmath133 . a second and last step",
    "then consists of projecting out one ( usually the highest ) spin , which gives rise to the equations named above . in this fashion",
    "the physical meanings of _ mass _ and _ spin _ merge with the abstract mathematical meaning of mere labels of irreducible representations .",
    "mass and spin are the most elementary attributes of physical objects , so that objects with no other attributes are therefore considered _ elementary_.",
    "as just described , these elementary attributes derive from the representation theory of a group whose significance is usually taken to be that it is the automorphism group of spacetime .",
    "however , as already discussed in sections[sec : genintro ] and [ sec : symmetryspacetime ] , this point of view presupposes a hierarchy of physical thinking in which spacetime ( here minkowski space ) is considered an entity prior to ( i.e. more fundamental than ) matter , which may well be challenged .",
    "a more consistent but also more abstract point of view would be to think of the abstract poincar group as prior to the matter content _ as well as _ the spacetime structure and to derive both simultaneously . here ` deriving ' a spacetime structure ( geometry ) from a group would be meant in the sense of klein s _ erlanger programm _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have already discussed in section[sec : genintro ] pauli s shift in emphasis towards a more abstract point of view as regards spacetime structure . but also as regards to matter he was , next to wigner , one of the proponents to put symmetry considerations first and to derive the wave equations of fundamental fields as outlined above . based on previous work by fierz on the theory of free wave equations for higher spin",
    "@xcite , fierz and pauli published their very influential paper _ on relativistic equations for particles of arbitrary spin in an electromagnetic field _",
    "( @xcite , vol.2 , pp.873 - 894 ) which is still much cited today .    in fact , much earlier , in his 1927 paper _",
    "_ quantum mechanics of the magnetic electron _ _ , pauli succeeded to implement the electron s spin into non - special - relativistic quantum mechanics in an entirely representation - theoretic fashion as regards the ( lie algebra of ) spatial rotations .",
    "in contrast to the other ( translational ) degrees or freedom , spin does not appear as the quantisation of an already existent classical degree of freedom .",
    "this must have appeared particularly appealing to pauli , who never wanted the electron s ` spin ' to be understood as an intrinsic angular momentum due to a spatial rotation of a material structure . when pauli introduced the new spin quantum - number for the electron in his 1924 paper _",
    "_ on the influence of the velocity dependence of the electron mass on the zeeman effect _",
    "_ he deliberately stayed away from any model interpretation and cautiously referred to it as _ _ a peculiar , classically indescribable disposition of two - valuedness of the quantum - theoretic properties of the light - electron__. at that time an understandable general scepticism against possible erroneous prejudices imposed by the usage of classical models had already firmly established itself in pauli s ( and others ) thinking .",
    "as much justified as this is in view of quantum mechanics , this had also led to overstatements to the effect that spin has no classical counterpart and that any classical model is even classically contradictory in the sense of violating special relativity .",
    "as regards the second point , which was also pushed by pauli , we refer to the detailed discussion in @xcite . to the first point we first wish to mention that composite models with half - integer angular momentum states exist in ordinary quantum mechanics ( without spin ) , as , e.g. , pointed out by bopp & haag in 1950 @xcite .",
    "this is possible if their classical configuration space contains the whole group @xmath134 of spatial rotations .",
    "pauli himself showed in his 1939 paper _ _ on a criterion for single- or double - valuedness of the eigenfunctions in wave mechanics _ _ the possibility of double - valued wavefunctions , which are the ones that give rise to half - integer angular momentum states .",
    "moreover , in classical mechanics there is also a precise analog of wigner s notion of an elementary system .",
    "recall that the space of states of a mechanical system is a symplectic manifold ( phase space ) .",
    "the analog of an irreducible and unitary representation of the group of spacetime automorphisms is now a transitive and hamiltonian action of this group on the symplectic manifold .",
    "it is interesting to note that this classical notion of an elementary system was only formulated much later than , and in the closest possible analogy with , the quantum mechanical one .",
    "an early reference where this is spelled out is @xcite .",
    "the classification of elementary systems is now equivalent to the classification of symplectic manifolds admitting such an action .",
    "an early reference where this has been done is  @xcite . here ,",
    "as expected , an intrinsic angular momentum shows up as naturally as it does in quantum mechanics .",
    "what makes it slightly unusual ( but by no means awkward or even inconsistent ) is the fact that it corresponds to a phase space that is not the cotangent bundle ( space of momenta ) over some configuration space of positions .",
    "pauli s later writings also show this strong inclination to set the fundamentals of ( quantum ) field theory in group - theoretic terms . in his survey",
    "_ relativistic field theories of elementary particles _ ( @xcite , vol.2 , pp.923 - 952 ) , written for the 1939 solvay congress , pauli immediately starts a discussion of `` transformation properties of the field equations and conservation laws '' . his posthumously published notes on _ continuous groups in quantum mechanics _  @xcite focus exclusively on lie - algebra methods in representation theory .",
    "today we are used to _ define _ physical quantities like energy , momentum , and angular momentum as the conserved quantities associated to spacetime automorphisms via noether s theorem . here ,",
    "too , pauli was definitely an early advocate of this way of thinking .",
    "reviews on the subject written shortly after pauli s death show clear traces of pauli s approach ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "pauli s proof of the spin - statistics correlation @xcite ( also @xcite , vol.2 , pp.911 - 922 ) , first shown by markus fierz in his habilitation thesis @xcite , is a truly impressive example for the force of abstract symmetry principles . here",
    "we wish to recall the basic lemmas on which it rests , which merely have to do with classical fields and representation theory .",
    "we begin by replacing the proper orthochronous lorentz group by its double (= universal ) cover @xmath122 in order to include half - integer spin fields .",
    "we stress that everything that follows merely requires the invariance under this group .",
    "no requirements concerning invariance under space- or time reversal are needed !",
    "we recall from the previous section that any finite - dimensional complex representation of @xmath122 is labelled by an ordered pair @xmath123 , where @xmath5 and @xmath135 may assume independently all non - negative integer or half - integer values .",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath125 correspond to the numbers of ` unprimed ' and ` primed ' spinor indices , respectively .",
    "the tensor product of two such representations decomposes as follows : @xmath136 where  and this is the important point in what follows  the sums proceed in _ integer _ steps in @xmath98 and @xmath137 . with each @xmath138",
    "let us associate a ` pauli index ' , given by @xmath139 this association may be extended to sums of such @xmath138 proceeding in integer steps , simply by assigning to the sum the pauli index of its terms ( which are all the same ) .",
    "then we have is a homomorphism of semigroups .",
    "one semigroup consists of direct sums of irreducible representations proceeding in integer steps with operation @xmath140 , the other is @xmath141 , which is actually a group . ]",
    "@xmath142 according to their representations , we can associate a pauli index with spinors and tensors .",
    "for example , a tensor of odd / even degree has pauli index @xmath143/@xmath144 .",
    "the partial derivative , @xmath145 , counts as a tensor of degree one .",
    "now consider the most general linear ( non interacting ) field equations for integer spin ( here and in what follows @xmath146 simply stands for `` sum of terms of the general form @xmath147 '' ) : @xmath148 these are invariant under @xmath149 next consider any current that is a polynomial in the fields and their derivatives : @xmath150 then one has @xmath151 this shows that for any solution of the field equations with charge @xmath152 for the conserved current @xmath153 ( @xmath152 being the space integral over @xmath154 ) there is another solution ( the @xmath155 transformed ) with charge @xmath156 .",
    "it follows that charges of conserved currents can not be sign - definite in any @xmath122-invariant theory of non - interacting integer spin fields . in the same fashion",
    "one shows that conserved quantities , stemming from divergenceless symmetric tensors of rank two , bilinear in fields , can not be sign - definite in any @xmath157 invariant theory of non - interacting half - integer spin fields .",
    "in particular , the conserved quantity in question could be energy !",
    "an immediate but far reaching first conclusion ( not explicitly drawn by pauli ) is that there can not exist a relativistic generalisation of schrdinger s one- particle wave equation .",
    "for example , for integer - spin particles , one simply can not construct a non - negative spatial probability distribution derived from conserved four - currents .",
    "this provides a general argument for the need of second quantisation , which in textbooks is usually restricted to the spin - zero case .    upon second quantisation the celebrated spin - statistics connection for free fields",
    "can now be derived in a few lines .",
    "it says that integer spin fields can not be quantised using anti - commutators and half - integer spin field can not be quantised using commutators . here",
    "the so - called jordan - pauli distribution plays a crucial role in the ( anti)commutation relations , which ensures causality ( observables localised in spacelike separated regions commute ) .",
    "also , the crucial hypothesis of the existence of an @xmath157 invariant stable vacuum state is adopted .",

    "it is interesting to note that einstein rediscovered the very same argument in 1925 and found it worthy of a separate communication  @xcite . at the time it was common to all , weyl , pauli , and einstein , to regard the argument a nuisance and of essentially destructive nature",
    "this was because at this time antiparticles had not yet been discovered so that the apparent asymmetry as regards the sign of the electric charges of fundamental particles was believed to be a fundamental property of nature .",

    "first of all , the two solutions are clearly considered physically distinct , otherwise the argument could not be understood as contradicting the charge asymmetry in nature .",
    "hence the diffeomorphism involved can not be considered a gauge transformation but rather corresponds to a proper physical symmetry . on the other hand , we know that diffeomorphisms within bounded regions must be considered as gauge transformations , for otherwise one would run into the dilemma set by the so - called `` hole argument '' be a bounded region in spacetime which is disjoint from a spacelike hypersurface @xmath22 .",
    "consider two solutions to the field equations which merely differ by the action of a diffeomorphism @xmath16 with support in @xmath169 .",

    "one issue that attracted much attention during the 1960s was , whether the observed particle multiplets could be understood on the basis of an all embracing symmetry principle that would combine the poincar group with the internal symmetry groups displayed by the multiplet structures .",
    "this combination of groups should be non - trivial , i.e. , not be a direct product , for otherwise the internal symmetries would commute with the spacetime symmetries and lead to multiplets degenerate in mass and spin ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , a number of no - go theorems appeared , which culminated in the now most famous theorem of coleman & mandula  @xcite .",

    "this result would not follow for the galilean group , as was explicitly pointed out by coleman & mandula ( @xcite , p.159 ) .",
    "one way to avoid the theorem of coleman & mandula is to generalise the notion of symmetries .",
    "an early attempt was made by golfand & likhtman  @xcite , who constructed what is now known as a super - lie algebra , which generalises the concept of lie algebra ( i.e. symmetry generators obeying certain commutation relations ) to one also involving anti - commutators . in this way it became possible for the first time to link particles of integer and half - integer spin by a symmetry principle .",
    "it is true that supersymmetry still maintains the degeneracy in masses and hence can not account for the mass differences in multiplets .",
    "but its most convincing property , the symmetry between bosons and fermions , suggested a most elegant resolution of the notorious ultraviolet divergences that beset quantum field theory .",
    "it is remarkable that the idea of a cancellation of bosonic and fermionic contributions to the vacuum energy density occurred to pauli . in his lectures _ selected topics in field quantization _ , delivered in 1950 - 51 ( in print again since 2000 , @xcite ) , he posed the question    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .. whether these zero - point energies [ from bosons and fermions ] can compensate each other . _ ( @xcite , p.33 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    he tried to answer this question by writing down the formal expression for the zero point energy density of a quantum field of spin @xmath172 and mass @xmath173 ( pauli restricted attention to spin @xmath77 and spin @xmath174 , but the generalisation is immediate ) : @xmath175 cancellation should take place for high values of @xmath176 .",

    "one is tempted to add !",
    "this would have been the first call for a supersymmetry in the year 1951 .",
    "however , the real world does not seem to be as simple as that .",
    "supersymmetry , if at all existent , is strongly broken in the phase we live in .",
    "so far no supersymmetric partner of any existing particle has been detected , even though some of them ( e.g. , the neutralino ) are currently suggested to be viable candidates for the missing - mass problem in cosmology .",
    "future findings ( or non - findings ) at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will probably have a decisive impact on the future of the idea of supersymmetry , which  whether or not it is realised in nature  is certainly very attractive ; and pauli came close to it .      ever since its first formulation in 1921 , pauli as well as einstein were much attracted by the geometric idea of theodor kaluza and its refinement by oskar klein , according to which the classical theories of the gravitational and the electromagnetic field could be unified into a single theory , in which the unified field has the same meaning as einsteins gravitational field in general relativity , namely as metric tensor of spacetime , but now in five instead of four dimensions .",
    "the momentum of a particle in the additional fifth direction ( which is spacelike ) is now to be interpreted as its charge .",
    "charge is conserved because the geometry of spacetime is _ a priori _ restricted to be independent of that fifth direction .",
    "the combined field equations are exactly the five - dimensional analog of einstein s equations for general relativity .",
    "a natural question to address in this unified classical theory was whether it admits solutions that could represent particle - like objects .",
    "more precisely , the solution should be stationary , everywhere regular , and possess long - ranging gravitational and electromagnetic fields ( usually associated with aspects of mass and charge ) .",
    "pauli , who was very well familiar with this theory since its first appearance , kept an active interest in it even after the formulations of quantum mechanics and early quantum electrodynamics , which made it unquestionable for him that the problem of matter could not be adequately addressed in the framework of a classical field theory , unlike einstein , who maintained such a hope in various forms until the end of his life in 1955 .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that in 1943 einstein and pauli wrote a paper in which they proved the non - existence of such solutions .",

    "note that this extra condition introduces non - dynamical background structures , so that of the 5-dimensional diffeomorphism group only those diffeomorphisms preserving this condition can act as symmetries , a point pauli often emphasised as a deficiency regarding the kaluza - klein approach .    restricting attention to five dimensions ,",
    "the explicitly stated hypotheses underlying the proof were these ( @xcite , p.131 ; annotations in square brackets within quotations are mine ) :    * `` the field is stationary ( i.e the @xmath158 [ the five - dimensional metric ] are independent of @xmath181 [ the time coordinate ] ) . '' clearly",
    ", @xmath158 is also assumed to be independent of the fifth coordinate @xmath182 . * `` it [ the field @xmath158 ] is free from singularities . ''",
    "* `` it is imbedded in a euclidean space ( of the minkowski type ) , and for large values of @xmath98 ( @xmath98 being the distance from the origin of the spatial coordinate system ) @xmath184 has the asymptotic form @xmath185 , where @xmath186 . ''",
    "the last condition is meant to assure the non - triviality of the solution , i.e. that there really is an attracting object at the spatial origin .",
    "this becomes clear if one recalls that in the lowest weak - field and slow - motion approximation @xmath187 just corresponds to the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "unfortunately , the other statement : `` it is imbedded in a euclidean space ( of the minkowski type ) '' seems ambiguous , since the solution is clearly not meant to be just ( a portion of ) 5-dimensional flat minkowski space .",
    "hence the next closest reading is presumably that the underlying five - dimensional spacetime manifold is ( diffeomorphic to ) @xmath188 , with some non - flat metric of minkowskian signature @xmath189 .    the elegant method of proof makes essential use of the fact that the suitably restricted group of spacetime diffeomorphisms ( to those preserving the cylinder condition ) is a symmetry group for the full set of equations in the sense of ( [ eq : defsymmetry ] ) of definition[def : symmetrygroup ] .",
    "more precisely , two types of diffeomorphisms from that class are considered separately by einstein and pauli :    * arbitrary ones in the three coordinates @xmath190 which leave invariant the @xmath191 coordinates . *",
    "linear ones in the @xmath191 coordinates , leaving invariant the @xmath190 .",
    "now , as a matter of fact , this innocent looking split introduces a further and , as it turns out , crucial restriction , over and above the hypotheses h1-h3 .",
    "the point is that the split and , in particular , the set d2 of diffeomorphisms simply do not exist unless the spacetime manifold , which in h3 was assumed to be @xmath188 , globally splits into @xmath192 such that the first factor , @xmath193 , corresponds to the @xmath194-planes of constant spatial coordinates @xmath190 and the second factor , @xmath63 , corresponds to the @xmath195-spaces of constant coordinates @xmath191 . but",
    "this need not be the case if h1-h3 are assumed .",

    "in fact , kurt gdel , who was already in princeton when pauli visited einstein , found his famous cosmological solution  @xcite in 1949 by a very similar geometric insight that also first led to the kaluza - klein monopole  @xcite . in the kk case , @xmath202 in gdels case .",
    "this simplifies the calculations considerably . ]",
    "one of pauli s major interests were discrete symmetries , in particular the transformation of space inversion , @xmath203 , also called _ parity _ transformation . given a linear wave equation which is symmetric under the proper orthochronous (",
    "i.e. including no space and time inversions ) poincar group , one may ask whether it is also symmetric under space and time inversions . for this to be a well defined question one has to formulate conditions on how these inversions interact with poincar transformations .",
    "let us focus on the operation of space inversion .",
    "if this operation is implementable by an operator @xmath204 , it must conjugate each rotation and each time translation to their respective self , and each boost and each space translation to their respective inverse .",
    "this follows simply from the geometric meaning of space inversion .",
    "hence , generally speaking , we need to distinguish the following three possible scenarios ( recall the notation from section[sec : dynamicalsymmetriesversuscovariance ] ) :    * @xmath204 acts on @xmath27 and is a symmetry , i.e. leaves @xmath31 invariant ; * @xmath204 acts on @xmath27 and is no symmetry , i.e. leaves @xmath31 not invariant ; * @xmath204 is not implementable on @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that when one states that a certain equation is not symmetric under @xmath204 one usually addresses situation ( b ) , though situation ( c ) also occurs , as we shall see .",
    "consider now the field of a massless spin-@xmath205 particle , that transforms irreducibly under the proper orthochronous poincar group .",
    "the field is then either a two - component spinor , @xmath206 , which in the absence of interactions obeys the so - called weyl equation invariant 2-form .",

    "@xmath207 alternatively , one may also start from a four - component dirac spinor , @xmath208 which carries a reducible representation of the proper orthochronous poincar group : if @xmath206 transforms with @xmath209 then @xmath210 transforms with @xmath211 ( being an element of the complex - conjugate dual space ) , so that the space of the upper two components @xmath206 of @xmath43 and the space of the lower two components @xmath210 of @xmath43 are separately invariant .",
    "one may then eliminate two of the four components by the so - called majorana condition , which requires the state @xmath43 to be identical to its charge - conjugate , @xmath212 , where @xmath213 hence for a majorana spinor one has @xmath214 and the interaction - free dirac equation reads @xmath215 one can now either regard ( [ eq : weyleq ] ) or ( [ eq : diraceq ] ) as the interaction - free equation for a neutrino .    here",
    "i wish to briefly recall a curious discussion between pauli and fierz on whether or not these two equations describe physically different state of affairs .",
    "superficially this discussion is about a formal and , mathematically speaking , rather trivial point .",
    "but , as we will see , it relates to deep - lying preconceptions in pauli s thinking about issues of symmetry .",
    "this makes it worth looking at this episode in some detail .",
    "first note that there is an obvious bijection , @xmath1 , between two - component spinors and majorana spinors , given by @xmath216 note also that the set of majorana spinors is _ a priori _ a _ _ real _ _ vector space , though it has a complex structure , @xmath172 , given by @xmath217 with respect to which the bijection ( [ eq : spinorbijection ] ) satisfies @xmath218 , where here @xmath219 stands for the standard complex structure ( multiplication with imaginary unit @xmath219 ) in the space @xmath220 of two - component spinors",

    "requires that the parity operator ( if existent ) commutes with spatial rotations and conjugates boosts to their inverse .",
    "the first requirement implies ( via schur s lemma ) that it must be a multiple of the identity in any irreducible representation that stays irreducible when restricted to the rotation subgroup , which contradicts the second requirement .",
    "hence it can not exist in such representations , which are precisely those with only unprimed or only primed indices . ]    on the other hand , the dirac equation _ is _ symmetric under space inversions .",
    "indeed , the spinor - map corresponding to the inversion in the spatial plane perpendicular to the timelike normal @xmath13 is given by @xmath221 where @xmath222 and where @xmath223 is a complex number of unit modulus , called the _ intrinsic parity _ of the particular field @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath204 is a symmetry of ( [ eq : diraceq ] ) for any @xmath223 .",
    "note that @xmath224 so that @xmath225 , since for spinors one only requires @xmath226 ( rather than @xmath227 ) .",
    "it is also easy to verify that @xmath204 commutes with @xmath228 iff @xmath229 .",
    "so if we assign imaginary parity to the majorana field , the operator @xmath204 also acts on the subspace of majorana spinors .",
    "we conclude that the free majorana equation _ is _ parity invariant .",
    "hence it seems at first that the weyl formulation and the majorana formulation differ since they have different symmetry properties .",
    "but this is not true . using the bijection ( [ eq : spinorbijection ] ) , we can pull - back the parity map ( [ eq : diracparity ] ) to the space of two - component spinors , where it becomes ( now either @xmath230 or @xmath231 ) @xmath232 which is now an anti - linear map on the space of two - component spinors .",
    "all this was essentially pointed out to pauli by markus fierz in a letter dated february 6th 1957 ( @xcite vol.iv , partiva , doc.[2494 ] , p.171 ) in connection with lee s and yang s two - component theory of the neutrino .",
    "fierz correctly concluded from this essential equivalence that the 2-component theory as such ( i.e. without interactions ) did not warrant the conclusion of parity violation ; only interactions could be held responsible for that .",
    "this was a relevant point in the theoretical discussion at the time , as can be seen from the fact that there were two independent papers published in _ the physical review _ shortly after fierz s private letter to pauli , containing the very same observation .",
    "the first paper was submitted on february 13th by mclennan  @xcite , the second on march 25th by case  @xcite .",
    "in fact , serpe made this observation already in 1952 @xcite and emphasised it once more in 1957  @xcite .",
    "one might be worried about the anti - linearity of the transformation in ( [ eq : weylparity ] ) . in that respect , also following fierz , an illuminating analogy may be mentioned regarding the vacuum maxwell equations , which can be written in the form @xmath233 where @xmath234 is a complex combination of the electric and magnetic field . both equations ( [ eq : complexmaxwelleq1 ] ) are clearly equivalent of the full set of maxwell s equations .",
    "it can be shown that spatial inversions can not be implemented as complex - linear transformations on the complex - valued field @xmath235 . )",
    "are equivalent to @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is the unprimed spinor equivalent of the tensor @xmath238 for the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "parity can not be linearly implemented on this purely unprimed spinor , for reasons already explained in footnote[foot : parityimplementability ] . ] but , clearly , we know that maxwell s equations are parity invariant , namely if we transform the electric field as @xmath239 ( ` polar ' vector - field ) and the magnetic field as @xmath240 ( ` axial ' vector - field ) , where @xmath241 .",
    "this corresponds to an _",
    "_ anti__linear symmetry of ( [ eq : complexmaxwelleq1 ] ) , given by @xmath242 .",
    "coming back to fierz s ( and other s ) original observation for the spinor field , they were accepted without much ado by others .",
    "for example , in her survey on the neutrino in the pauli memorial volume , madame wu states that `` it is the interaction and the interaction only that violates parity '' ( @xcite , footnote on p.270 . ) . in note 25c of that paper",
    "she explicitly thanks fierz for `` enlightening discussions '' on the two - component theory of the neutrino .",
    "clearly fierz expected his observation to be of interest to pauli , who had already in the 1933 first edition of his handbook article on wave mechanics propagated the view that weyl s two - component equations are    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ... not invariant under reflections ( interchange of left and right ) and , as a consequence , not applicable to the physical reality .",

    "pauli s point seems to have been that he wanted to maintain the particle - antiparticle distinction _ independently _ of parity , whereas fierz pointed out that the two - component theory provided no corresponding structural element : in weyl s form the operations @xmath228 and @xmath204 simply do not exist separately , in the majorana form @xmath204 exists and @xmath228 is the identity ( hence not distinguishing ) . psychologically speaking ,",
    "pauli s point becomes perhaps more understandable if one takes into account the fact that since the fall of 1956 he was thinking about the question of lepton - charge conservation .",

    "( @xcite , vol.2 , pp.1338 - 1349 ) , pauli once more showed his mastery of symmetry considerations while keeping everything at the largest possible degree of generality .",
    "he starts by considering the most general ultralocal four - fermion interactions ( not necessarily preserving parity or lepton charge ) in which the neutrino field is represented by a dirac 4-spinor , @xmath43 . for what follows it",
    "is convenient to think of the four components of @xmath43 as comprising the following four particle states ( per momentum ) : a left - handed neutrino , @xmath256 , a right - handed neutrino , @xmath257 , and their antiparticles @xmath258 and @xmath259 respectively .",
    "note that this means @xmath260 and that accordingly @xmath258 is right- and @xmath259 is left - handed . here",
    "we follow the convention of  @xcite .",
    "next pauli considers a four - parameter group of canonical transformations ( i.e. they leave the anticommutation relations between the fermion fields invariant ) of the neutrino field , henceforth called the _ pauli group _ , whose interpretation will be given below .",
    "these transformations define a symmetry of the interaction - free equations of motions ( assuming a massless neutrino throughout ) , but will generally _ not _ define a symmetry once the interaction is taken into account . rather , the following is true ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : suppose that the general interaction depends on a finite number of coupling constants @xmath261 for @xmath262 and that the equations of motion follow from an action principle with lagrange density @xmath263 , where @xmath22 represents the array of coupling constants ( we notationally ignore other non - dynamical structures here ) and @xmath23 the dynamical fields .",
    "then the pauli group acts as covariance in a slightly stronger sense than ( [ eq : defcovariance2 ] ) , namely so that @xmath264 this means that on the level of the lagrange density ( or the hamiltonian ) , and hence in particular at the level of the equations of motion , the transformation of the dynamical fields can be compensated for by a transformation of the coupling constants . a large part of pauli s paper is actually devoted to the determination of that compensating action of the pauli group on the array of coupling constants .",
    "next suppose the initial state is chosen to be invariant under the pauli group , i.e. @xmath265 for all @xmath35 .",
    "then ( [ eq : paulisymmetry ] ) implies that its evolution with interaction parametrised by @xmath22 ( the array of @xmath261 s ) is identical to the evolution parametrised by @xmath55 for any @xmath35 .",
    "hence the outcome of the evolution can only depend on the @xmath261 s through their pauli - invariant combinations .",
    "in particular , since the neutrinoless double beta - decay simply has no initial neutrino , this reasoning can be applied to it .",
    "if this lepton - charge - conservation violating process is deemed impossible , the corresponding pauli - invariant combination of coupling constants to which the scattering probability is proportional must vanish .",
    "this , in turn , gives the sought - after constraint on the possible four - fermion interaction . for ( massless ) neutrinos in majorana representation pauli finally arrived at the result that either only the left- or the right - handed component enters the interaction .",
    "it should be added that this clever sort of reasoning was shortly before used by pursey in a less general setting  @xcite in which the interaction was specialised _ a priori _ to conserve lepton charge . part . ]",
    "more on the history of the search for the right form of the four - fermion interaction may be found in  @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the possibility of neutrinoless double beta - decays is currently still under active experimental investigation at the national gran sasso laboratory , where the 2003 - 2005 cuoricino experiment set upper bounds for the majorana mass of the electron neutrino well below one @xmath266 .",
    "the upcoming next - generation experiment , cuore , is designed to lower this bound to @xmath267 ; compare @xcite .",
    "what is the interpretation of the pauli group ?",
    "mathematically it is isomorphic to @xmath268 , the group of @xmath269 unitary matrices acting on a two - dimensional complex vector space .",
    "here there are two such spaces ( per 4-momentum ) in which it acts : the ` left - handed subspace ' that is spanned by the two left - handed components @xmath256 and @xmath259 , and the ` right - handed subspace ' that is spanned by the two right - handed components @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "the two actions of @xmath268 in these spaces are complex conjugate to each other ( see equation ( [ eq : pauligroupaction ] ) ) .",
    "usually one thinks of the pauli group as @xmath270 , which is a double cover of @xmath268 , so that the four real parameters are written as a phase @xmath271 , parametrising @xmath272 , and two complex parameters @xmath273 satisfying @xmath274 , which give three real parameters when split into real and imaginary part and which parametrise a 3-sphere that underlies @xmath275 as group manifold . in this parametrisation the action of the pauli group reads ( an asterisk stands for complex conjugation ) : as @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the charge conjugate field .",
    "but this is easily seen to be equivalent to ( [ eq : pauligroupaction ] ) if one sets @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "the more explicit form ( [ eq : pauligroupaction ] ) is better suited for the interpretational discussion ; cf .",
    "the two - to - one homomorphism from @xmath270 to @xmath268 is given by @xmath280 whose kernel is @xmath281 . ]",
    "[ eq : pauligroupaction ] @xmath282    invariance under the pauli group is now seen to correspond to an ambiguity in the particle - antiparticle distinction .",
    "this ambiguity would only be lifted by interactions that allowed to distinguish the two left and the two right states respectively . in the absence of such interactions the various definitions of ` particle ' and ` antiparticle ' are physically indistinguishable , so that the pauli group acts by _ gauge _ symmetries in the sense of section[sec : physicalversusgaugesymmetries ] .",
    "also , the different presentations of the two - component theory , already discussed in section[sec : irritations ] can be seen here .",
    "the majorana condition reads @xmath283 , which in terms of the four components introduced above leads to @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "this can be read in two different ways , depending on whether one addresses @xmath286 or @xmath287 as independent basic states .",
    "in the first case one would say that there is a left - handed neutrino and its right - handed antiparticle , whereas in the second case one regards the tuple @xmath288 as respectively the left- and right - handed components of a single particle which is identical to its antiparticle .    beyond weak interaction and beta - decay , the pauli group played a very important rle in pauli s brief participation in heisenberg s programme for a unified field theory .",
    "it was pauli who first showed that the ( so far classical ) non - linear spinor equation proposed by heisenberg was invariant under the pauli group ( cf .",
    "heisenberg s account in his letter to zimmermann from jan.7th 1958 in @xcite , vol.iv , partivb , p.779 ) . in this new context the @xmath272 part of the pauli group was connected to conservation of baryon charge and",
    "the @xmath275 part acquired the meaning of isospin symmetry .",
    "the central importance of isospin for this programme may already be inferred from the title of the proposed common publication by heisenberg and pauli , which reads : _ on the isospin group in the theory of elementary particles_. however , due to pauli s later retreat from this programme , the manuscript ( cf .",
    "@xcite , vol.iv , partivb , pp.849 - 861 ) for this publication never grew beyond the stage of a preprint .      in his last paper on the subject of discrete symmetries , entitled _ _ the violation of mirror - symmetries in the laws of atomic physics _ _",
    "( @xcite , vol.2 , pp.1368 - 1372 ) , pauli comes back to the question which bothered him most : how is the strength of an interaction related to its symmetry properties ? he says that having established a violation of @xmath246 and @xmath247 symmetry for weak interactions , we may ask why they are maintained for strong and electromagnetic interactions , and whether the reason for this is to be found in particular properties of these interactions .",
    "he ends with some speculations on possible connections between violations of @xmath246 and @xmath247 symmetry in the laws of microphysics on one hand , and properties of theories of gravitation and its cosmological solutions on the other : um bei der frage des zusammenhangs zwischen dem kleinen und dem grossen ber vage spekulationen hinauszugelangen , fehlen daher noch wesentlich neue ideen .",
    "hiermit soll jedoch nicht die unmglichkeit eines solchen zusammenhanges bestimmt behauptet werden . ''",
    "( @xcite , vol.2 , p.1371 ) ]    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ second , one can try to find and justify a connection between symmetry violation in the small with properties of the universe in the large .",
    "but this exceeds the capabilities of the presently known theory of gravity . [ ... ] new ideas are missing to go beyond vague speculations .",
    "but this shall not be taken as definite expression for the impossibility of such a connection .",

    ", he observes that in weyl s theory ( as well as in einstein s own attempts from that time ) it is natural to suspect a relation between the size of the electron and the size ( mean curvature radius ) of the universe .",
    "but then he comments somewhat dismissively that this _ _ might seem somewhat fantastic__(@xcite , p.202 ) .",
    "i have tried to display some of the aspects of the notion of symmetry in the work of wolfgang pauli which to me seem sufficiently interesting in their own right . in doing this",
    "i have drawn freely from pauli s scientific vre , irrespectively of whether the particular part is commonly regarded as established part of present - day scientific knowledge or not .",
    "pauli s faith in the explanatory power of symmetry principles clearly shows up in all corner of his vre , but it also appears clearly rooted beyond the limits of his science .    in the editorial epilogue to the monumental collection of pauli s scientific correspondence , karl von meyenn reports that many physicists he talked to at the outset of his project spoke against the publication of those letters that contained ideas which did not stand the test of time  ( @xcite , vol.iv , partivb , p.1375 ) . leaving aside that this must clearly sound outrageous to the historian ,",
    "it is , in my opinion , also totally misguided as far as the scientific endeavour is concerned .",
    "science is not only driven by the urge to _ know _ but also , and perhaps most importantly , by the urge to _",
    "understand_. no one who as ever actively participated in science can deny that .",
    "one central aspect of scientific understanding , next to offering as many as possible alternative and complementary explanations for the actual occurrences in nature , is to comprehend why things could not be different from what they appear to be . the insight into a theoretical or an explanatory failure can be as fruitful as an experimental failure .",
    "what makes pauli a great scientist , amongst the other most obvious reasons , is not that he did not err  such mortals clearly do not exist , but that we can still learn much from where he erred and how he erred . in that sense , let me end by the following words from johann wolfgang von goethe s _ maximen und reflexionen _ ( # 1292 ) :    * acknowledgements : * i sincerely thank harald atmanspacher and hans primas for the invitation to talk at the conference on _ wolfgang pauli s philosophical ideas and contemporary science _ on the monte verita in ascona , switzerland .",
