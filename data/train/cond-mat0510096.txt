    "the experimental realization of optical lattices @xcite is stimulating new perspectives in the study of cold bosons .",
    "optical lattices have enabled us to observe quantum phenomena such as number squeezing @xcite , collapses and revivals @xcite and the diffraction of matter waves @xcite .",
    "apart from these examples , bec in optical lattices are particularly promising physical systems to study the superfluid properties of bose gases @xcite .",
    "the bose - hubbard model has been realized and the quantum phase transition from superfluid to a mott insulator state was indeed observed experimentally @xcite . it was predicted that for deep optical lattices the condensate superflow can be lost not only by energetic instability but also by dynamical instability @xcite .",
    "the dynamic instability was verified by the experiments @xcite . in a seminal work by kramer _",
    "@xcite , they have found the mass renormalization in presence of the optical potential which decreases the value of the axial excitation frequencies .",
    "these discrete axial excitation frequencies are experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "there are several theoretical calculations @xcite for the sound velocity in a quasi-1d bose gas placed in an 1d optical lattice .",
    "the axial excitations of a cigar shaped condensate can be divided into two regimes : i ) short wavelength excitations where wavelength is much smaller than the axial size , ii ) long wavelength excitations where wavelength is equal or larger than the axial size of the system . in the former case",
    ", these excitations can be classified with a continuous wave vector @xmath0 .",
    "however , the finite transverse size of the condensate also produces a discreteness of the spectrum . the short wavelength axial phonons with different number of discrete radial modes of a cigar shaped condensates ( without optical lattice ) give rise to the multi - branch bogoliubov spectrum ( mbs ) @xcite .",
    "the mbs was observed in a bragg spectroscopy with a long duration of the bragg pulses @xcite .",
    "an array of weakly coupled quasi - two - dimensional condensates can be created by applying a relatively strong one - dimensional optical lattices to an ordinary three dimensional cigar shaped condensate along the symmetry axis . in presence of the periodic lattices , the mbs can be called as multibranch bogoliubov - bloch spectrum ( mbbs ) .",
    "it is useful to study the mbbs in view of the possibility of the experimental verification .",
    "it should be noted that all the modes in a given angular momentum sector are coupled among themselves for any finite value of the axial momentum .",
    "for example , when we excite the system to study the sound propagation along the symmetry axis , this perturbation inherently excites all other low energy transverse modes having zero angular momentum .",
    "therefore , all modes are coupled with each other in the same angular momentum sector .",
    "martikainen and stoof @xcite have studied the mbbs only for monopole and lowest energy quadrupole modes without considering the coupling among the various modes within a given symmetry by means of time - dependent gaussian variational ansatz .",
    "later , martikainen and stoof @xcite have calculated the spectrum of the phonon and the monopole modes by considering only the coupling between the phonon and the breathing modes .",
    "but it is noted that the sound mode is coupled not only with the breathing mode but also with other low energy modes having zero angular momentum .",
    "similarly , the lowest energy quadrupole mode is also coupled with other low energy quadrupole modes .",
    "there is a lack of complete study on the mbbs in this system . for complete and correct description of mbbs",
    "we have to consider the couplings among all low energy modes in the same angular momentum sector . in our discretize hydrodynamic description , the couplings among all the modes in the same angular momentum sector",
    "are included naturally and we will see in the next section .",
    "in this work we study the excitations in a stack of weakly coupled quasi - two - dimensional condensates .",
    "the multibranch bogoliubov - bloch spectrum of such system is presented by using the hydrodynamic theory .",
    "the mbbs strongly depends on the coupling between the inhomogeneous density in the radial plane and the density modulation along the symmetry axis .",
    "note that one can study only the spectrum of sound , monopole and quadrupole modes without considering the mode coupling completely by using the time - dependent gaussian variational method .",
    "our discretize hydrodynamic method presented in this paper goes beyond the time - dependent variational method . in principle",
    ", we can calculate all low energy spectrum by including the mode coupling in a given angular momentum sector as long as the excitation energies are less than the chemical potential .",
    "we find that the multibranch bogoliubov - bloch spectrum changes due to presence of the mode - coupling within a given angular momentum symmetry . therefore , the mode - coupling should be taken into account while calculating the spectrum correctly .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we consider an array of weakly coupled quasi - two - dimensional bose condensates .",
    "using the discretize hydrodynamic theory , we calculate the multibranch bogoliubov - bloch spectrum by including the mode coupling within a given symmetry . we give a brief summary and conclusions in sec .",

    ". we also assumed that @xmath10 so that it makes a long cigar shaped trap .",
    "the minima of the optical potential are located at the points @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lattice size along the @xmath2-axis . around these minima , @xmath13 , where the layer trap frequency is @xmath14 . in the usual experiments ,",
    "the well trap frequency is larger than than the axial harmonic frequency , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we can also ignore the harmonic potential along the @xmath2-axis since the deep optical lattice dominates over the harmonic potential along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "the strong laser intensity will give rise to an array of several quasi - two - dimensional condensates .",
    "because of the quantum tunneling , the overlap between the wave functions between two consecutive layers can be sufficient to ensure full coherence .",
    "if the tunneling is too small , the strong phase fluctuations will destroy the coherence and lead to a new quantum state , namely mott insulator state .    in the presence of coherence among the layers it is natural to take the ansatz for the wave function as ( x , y , z ) = _ j _ j(x , y ) f(z - z_j ) . here",
