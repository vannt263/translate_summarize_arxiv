    "since this is above the eddington limit for normal stellar - mass compact objects , it has been widely thought that they are associated with intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) @xcite , although non - spherical accretion and beamed emission could give rise to inferred luminosities significantly above the eddington limit ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing also for lower masses .",
    "@xcite have reported nustar observations of ulx m82 x-2 ( also known as nustar j095551 + 6940.8 ) which reveal periodic changes in the hard x - ray luminosity of this source , indicative of a rotating magnetized neutron star being involved rather than a black hole . the measured peak flux ( in the @xmath1 band )",
    "would correspond to @xmath2 if the radiation were isotropic , and is challenging to explain with a neutron star .",
    "the period ( taken to be the neutron - star spin period ) was found to be @xmath3 , with a 2.53-day sinusoidal modulation , interpreted as being an orbital period @xmath4 corresponding to motion around an unseen companion which would be the mass donor in the accreting system .",
    "the time derivative of the spin period @xmath5 was also measured .",
    "values for this coming from different individual observations show considerable variations but a relevant underlying spin - up tendency was found , with @xmath6 .",
    "the mass donor is indicated as having a mass larger than @xmath7 , so that the system should be categorized as a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "taking canonical neutron star parameters as a rough guide ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , the luminosity relation @xmath10 , gives the mass accretion rate corresponding to @xmath11 as being @xmath12 .",
    "there are three main mechanisms by which the mass transfer might occur : ( i ) via a spherical wind ( as for o - type hmxbs ) , ( ii ) via a disc - shaped wind ( as for be - type hmxbs ) , or ( iii ) by roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "because of the large inferred @xmath13 , the third option was suggested as the mechanism by @xcite and subsequent studies @xcite .    here",
    ", we investigate each of these scenarios in turn to see which may be appropriate for ulx m82 x-2 . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the strength required for the neutron - star magnetic field , and show that it needs to be moderately strong but not at a magnetar level . in section 3 , we discuss the applicability of scenarios ( i)-(iii ) , finding that ( i ) is excluded but that ( ii ) and ( iii ) could be viable possibilities . in section 4 , we discuss the role of the propeller effect and transient behaviour , and section 5 contains conclusions .",
    "in the standard picture for hmxbs , the system has to be fairly young because the companion donor star is massive enough to have only a rather short main - sequence life - time .",
    "matter coming from the donor star falls towards its neutron star companion , becomes included in a keplerian accretion disc , and eventually becomes entrained by the neutron star s magnetic field , creating hot x - ray emitting accretion columns above the magnetic poles ( cf .",
    "sufficiently young neutron stars typically have magnetic - field strengths above @xmath14 ( see , for example , the data in the atnf pulsar catalogue , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a tail of the distribution extending beyond @xmath15 and eventually joining with the magnetar regime at @xmath16 .",
    "this can be relevant for explaining how this source can be so luminous , because if the magnetic field is stronger than the quantum limit , @xmath17 , the scattering cross - section would be suppressed , reducing the opacity of matter in the accretion columns above the magnetic poles and allowing higher luminosities . with this in mind , @xcite suggested that this source might contain a magnetar .",
    "the computational results of @xcite and the evidence of propeller effect from @xcite support this idea . in other works , however , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have explored different scenarios with standard pulsar fields @xmath18 , while other authors have advocated weaker fields , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "as the present work was being completed , we have seen a new paper by @xcite , advocating a model with strong beaming and a magnetic field of @xmath20 .",
    "the work presented here represents a line of study parallel to theirs .",
    "we focus here on a scenario with a field at the top end of the range for standard pulsars . in the rest of this section",
    ", we apply some simple assumptions for testing the relevance of a solution of this type .",
    "we take the full entrainment of the accreting matter by the magnetic field to occur close to the magnetic radius , @xmath21 , where the magnetic pressure balances the ram pressure of the infalling matter . using the condition of mass continuity ,",
    "we then obtain the following expression for the magnetic radius : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the field strength at the surface of the neutron star , and @xmath24 is the ratio of the accretion velocity to the free - fall velocity @xcite . at @xmath25 ,",
    "the accreting matter is taken to come into corotation with the neutron star , with the corotation speed being @xmath26 . since the system is probably close to spin equilibrium @xcite , it is reasonable to take @xmath27 as being approximately equal to the keplerian velocity at @xmath25 .",
    "we can then estimate the appropriate value of the field strength in order to be consistent with the observed spin period for ulx m82 x-2 .",
    "this gives @xmath28 interestingly , this value is just above the critical quantum limit @xmath29 at which electron scattering is suppressed , as mentioned earlier : @xmath30 @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : bns ] ) , from considerations of the spin period .    based on these two independent estimates ,",
    "we conclude that having a field of @xmath35 can be consistent with the interpretation that m82 x-2 could be an example ( albeit a rather extreme one ) of previously - known classes of hmxbs ( see , for example , @xcite )",
    ". a field of this strength can be just large enough to permit the quantum suppression of electron scattering as invoked by @xcite .",
    "in this section , we examine the different possibilities mentioned in the introduction for the accretion mode of ulx m82 x-2 .",
    "the two mechanisms operating for standard hmxbs are : ( i ) accretion from a spherical wind emitted by the donor star , and ( ii ) accretion from a disc - shaped wind , thought to come from a `` decretion disc '' around the donor star ( in a decretion disc , angular momentum is continually added to the inner edge of the disc from the rapidly rotating central star , and the matter drifts outwards rather than inwards ) .",
    "type ( i ) occurs for ob - type hmxbs , while type ( ii ) fuels be - type hmxbs .",
    "additionally , although there is no observational evidence for this in standard hmxb studies , it is possible that roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) could be relevant here ; we are referring to this as type ( iii ) . @xcite and @xcite both suggested rlof as a likely accretion mode for m82 x-2 , but did not discuss it in detail . in a recent paper , however , @xcite presented an argument suggesting that a certain proportion of ulxs should indeed be accreting neutron stars with rlof mass - transfer . here",
    ", we will consider each of the mechanisms in turn to assess which of them may be appropriate for our case . in order to give a luminosity as high as that observed ,",
    "the accretion rate needs to be at least as high as @xmath36 , as shown earlier .",
    "first , we consider whether a spherical stellar wind coming from the massive donor could successfully fuel ulx m82 x-2 ( type ( i ) accretion ) . in simple stellar wind models ,",
    "the wind velocity is frequently described by an expression of the form @xmath37 @xcite , where @xmath38 is the terminal velocity of the wind , @xmath39 is the stellar radius , @xmath40 is the distance from the centre of the donor star , and @xmath41 is a parameter whose value is close to unity ( we will take @xmath42 exactly here ) . the accretion rate from a spherical wind is usually described by the hoyle - lyttleton formula @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the accretion radius defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the velocity of the neutron star relative to the accreting matter : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the orbital velocity of the neutron star .",
    "the wind density can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the rate of mass loss from the donor star .",
    "if one specifies a particular value for @xmath50 , the accretion rate @xmath13 can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dotm ] ) , and then the corresponding x - ray luminosity of the neutron star can be obtained from @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite have given analytic formulae from which @xmath50 can be calculated for high - mass stars in terms of their mass @xmath52 , luminosity @xmath53 , effective temperature @xmath54 and the ratio @xmath55 , where @xmath38 is the wind s terminal velocity and @xmath56 is the escape velocity from the stellar surface .",
    "a change in behaviour occurs when @xmath54 passes a value @xmath57 and separate formulae are given for temperatures above and below that . here",
    "we use the mass loss rates given by equations ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) in their paper .",
    "the ratio @xmath55 is known to be @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 @xcite while values for @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be obtained as functions of @xmath52 using a stellar evolution code ( we used the analytic fitting formulae from the paper by @xcite ) . putting this data into eqs .",

    "it is clear , from this figure , that even if we consider the most efficient conditions , and an optimal viewing angle , an x - ray luminosity of ulx level ( @xmath65 ) can not be achieved .",
    "hence , we conclude that ulx m87 x-2 can not be fed by a spherical wind because the density of the wind would not be high enough .",
    "the corbet diagram ( where @xmath4 is plotted against @xmath66 ) is frequently used in studies of hmxbs , and it can be useful to consider it also in the present context .",
    "ob - type and be - type hmxbs show clearly different distributions in these diagrams , with the majority of the be - type ones being close to the diagonal from lower - left to upper - right ( they are the points marked with a @xmath67 in fig .",

    "@xcite obtained an expression for the sequence followed by the be - type hmxbs by assuming the hoyle - lyttleton accretion rate given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dotm ] ) .",
    "the decretion disc wind parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 could be taken from any appropriate wind model ; @xcite adopted a simple disc - shaped model : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the density and velocity at the stellar radius @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is a constant which needs to be fixed . in order to explain the positions of known standard be - hmxbs in the corbet diagram , @xcite used @xmath75 , and we will also use this value in the following",
    "this choice is roughly consistent with recent numerical computations of be - disc winds @xcite . with this wind model and any specified value of the magnetic field strength ,",
    "one can obtain a corresponding relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath4 by substituting equation ( [ eq : dotm ] ) into equation ( [ eq : bns ] ) ( @xmath4 is related to @xmath76 via equation ( [ eq : a ] ) ) .",

    "stellar radii at several evolutionary stages ( zero - age main sequence , the end of the main sequence and the beginning of the giant branch ) are also shown .",
    "if @xmath64 is larger than @xmath100 , the donor star already fills its roche lobe during the main sequence stage , leading to the type of mass transfer known as case a @xcite .",
    "this occurs on the thermal timescale @xmath101 for a massive star , this timescale is shorter than @xmath102 and the mass transfer rate reaches @xmath103 , which is sufficient for feeding ulx m87 x-2 .",
    "however , for the most massive stars ( @xmath104 ) , the main - sequence stellar radius would be larger than the orbital radius as well , so that a common envelope would form around the binary in a short time scale . in that case",
    ", the system would be luminous at infra - red frequencies rather than in x - rays @xcite ; the donor must therefore be less massive than this in order to give the right sort of rlof accretion .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the donor ought to be restricted by the fact that the companion is a neutron star : the progenitor of the neutron star would have been the primary when this binary system was born and , according to @xcite , it should have had an original mass of less than @xmath105 in order to give rise to a neutron star rather than a black hole .",
    "the present primary should be less massive than the original one ( even if its mass may have increased slightly during the first mass transfer stage ) , and hence the donor mass is constrained to be less than roughly @xmath106 .",
    "another issue which needs to be taken into account is that if the mass ratio @xmath107 is above a certain limit ( @xmath108 for a red giant , and @xmath109 for a high - mass main sequence star ) , the binary would be subject to the darwin instability , meaning that it could not sustain a circular orbit as required in order for rlof to be a viable candidate mechanism here @xcite .    for @xmath64 between @xmath110 , the star will be inside its roche lobe during its main sequence lifetime but",
    "may overflow it during its expansion at the end of the main sequence ( hertzsprung gap phase ) , giving an early case b type of mass transfer .",
    "this also proceeds on the thermal timescale , as given above , and could in principle be sufficient to feed ulx m87 x-2 .",
    "however , in general the timescale on which the star crosses the hertzsprung gap is quite short .",
    "for instance , an @xmath111 star evolves from the end of the main sequence to the giant branch in 0.35 myr @xcite and would have a radius between @xmath96 and @xmath76 for only some fraction of that ( determining which would require a detailed stellar evolution calculation ) .",
    "the relevant time is then very short compared with the overall life - time of the star ( @xmath112 for @xmath113 ) .",
    "however , the duration of the hertzsprung gap phase depends sensitively on the mass of the donor star and for the minimum donor mass envisaged , @xmath7 @xcite , it becomes @xmath114 .",
    "while it would still require a lucky chance to see any ulx fed by this case b type of rlof accretion , it would become less unlikely with the least massive possible donor stars . in connection with this : according to the population synthesis simulation of @xcite ,",
    "the number of ulxs containing a neutron star should peak for systems having donor stars in a small mass range around @xmath115 , and so it is possible that the short ulx lifetime of these systems could be compensated by there being so many of them , and that they might actually predominate in the observations .    to summarise : accretion via rlof",
    "might possibly be the mechanism for ulx m82 x-2 if the donor is an evolved star of @xmath116 passing through the hertzsprung gap .",
    "an rlof scenario with a main sequence donor of @xmath117 could also be a possibility although , for the higher masses , such a system would be prone to the orbit becoming eccentric due to the darwin instability .",
    "an rlof scenario with the donor being evolved up to the giant phase is ruled out completely .",
    "in the previous sections , we have discussed similarities between ulx m82 x-2 and known standard hmxbs , in terms of the strength of the neutron star s magnetic field and the accretion mode . in section 2",
    ", we concluded that a fairly strong magnetic field , of around @xmath118 is favoured for this object . while our considerations have been quite simple ones , this conclusion is consistent with more detailed analyses @xcite . in section 3 , we considered the possible feeding mechanisms , concluding that accretion modes similar to those of standard be - hmxbs are possible here , and that some mechanisms involving roche lobe overflow would also be possible . in the present section ,",
    "we discuss two further related issues .",
    "the 1.37 second spin period of the neutron star in ulx m82 x-2 is shorter than those of most hmxbs ( which are typically in the range of @xmath119 ) . in view of this and the rather high magnetic field which we are inferring",

    ", width=302 ]    it has been reported that archival data for m82 x-1/x-2 from xmm newton shows only tiny fluctuations at a level below 2.2 % @xcite .",
    "this could be understood in two different ways .",
    "firstly , the pulsations seen by @xcite could be a transient behaviour so that while xmm newton did not see the pulsations during the time - span of its observations , nustar did see them .",
    "the second possibility is that the pulsations might be observable only in the high energy range above 10 kev , so that nustar could detect them while xmm newton could not .",
    "@xcite , noting the variations seen by @xcite in different measurements of @xmath5 , have suggested that the system may be marginal for exhibiting the propeller effect , switching it on and off , and that the strong x - ray emissions and pulsations may only be observed when the propeller mechanism is not operating whereas during the propeller phase , only radiation from the hot disc is seen . in their latest and more extended analysis @xcite",
    ", they conclude that the magnetically threaded disc model with @xmath132 could explain the observed properties of this object very well .",
    "@xcite also argue that the observed bimodal distribution of x - ray luminosity can be interpreted as being due to the propeller effect switching on and off . in their picture , even when the system is in the propeller regime , a small fraction of matter still leaks through the magnetic field lines and continues to give rise to lower luminosity emission .",
    "another point is that hmxbs can often show different pulsation behaviour in different energy ranges , with the higher energy x - rays being emitted as a _ pencil beam _ , while lower energy ones are emitted as a _ fan beam _ @xcite . in this case",
    ", the emission directions would be different for the different energy ranges .",
    "in fact , more than 20% of hmxbs show different light - curve shapes in high and low energy bands @xcite . at present , the discussion on the transient behavior of m82 x-2 can not be concluded at all .",
    "more data is needed for deciding between these different possibilities .",
    "also one needs to consider the effect of irradiation of the accreting matter by the strong x - ray emission coming from the neutron star .",
    "the direct effect of the radiation pressure coming from this is , of course , to act as another obstacle for the accretion . in order to achieve a high accretion rate in luminous x - ray systems ,",

    ". another potential positive effect of x - ray irradiation is that it could in principle cause the roche lobe to become swamped with heated outer - envelope matter which could then overflow the roche lobe even if the stellar radius was smaller than roche radius @xcite .",
    "this would require very strong irradiation though ; it could only work in tight systems with orbital periods of a few hours , and would not play any significant role for m82 x-2 .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the magnetic field strength and accretion mode for the recently identified neutron star in the source ulx m82 x-2 .",
    "we have considered the conditions required for producing the observed values of the key parameters : @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , and have argued that a consistent explanation can be given involving a moderately strong magnetic field at around the quantum limit @xmath138 . having a field strength above the quantum limit is favourable for explaining the high observed luminosity , because of the reduced opacity in this case .",
    "however , we note that there have been a number of other suggestions regarding the magnetic field strength @xcite ; further observations and discussions are required for resolving the issue .",
    "we then went on to examine whether the standard accretion modes for hmxbs can be appropriate for this object .",
    "we concluded that spherical wind accretion , which drives ob - type hmxbs , can not be the mechanism here but that an extension of the standard mechanism for be - type hmxbs can provide a natural explanation .",
    "we have shown that if the neutron star has a moderately strong magnetic field ( @xmath139 ) and there is wind accretion from a reasonably high - density ( @xmath140 ) decretion disc around the be - companion , then all of the main properties of ulx m82 x-2 , including its position on the corbet diagram , would be consistent with the relations followed by standard be - hmxbs .",

    "if the donor star has sufficiently high mass , it should still be on the main sequence and case a rlof accretion could then feed the ulx ; if it has lower mass , it would need to be undergoing case b rlof while passing through the hertzsprung gap during its post - main - sequence expansion .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with odele straub and hitoshi yamaoka during the course of this work ."
