    "<S> this problem and its generalizations , including additions of a uniform gravitational force , air drag , end masses , and tangential motion of material elements along the string , have been considered in diverse contexts by engineers , physicists , and mathematicians . </S>",

    "<S> whether thought of as tethers whirling drogues , yarn balloons , or troposkeins , these flexible bodies adopt their configurations through a simple and ubiquitous process . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is rather surprising that a fully three - dimensional analytical treatment of the bare - bones problem remains unpublished . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is likely due to the imposition of certain boundary conditions that severely restricted the solution space explored by previous researchers . </S>",
    "<S> this note details solutions of the unaugmented problem , with general boundary conditions .    given a time - dependent curve @xmath0 parametrized by arc length @xmath1 , the balance of inertia and line tension in an inextensible , perfectly flexible and twistable string of uniform mass density @xmath2 is described by the vector wave equation and metrical constraint @xmath3 where the stress @xmath4 is a multiplier field enforcing the constraint @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the remaining equation and constraint equation may now be written in two ways . </S>",

    "<S> , these limits only give sensical results if they are taken for the correct equation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the products of integration constants in the denominators actually represent the same physical quantity , and equations are , in fact , the same equation . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the cubic coefficients in or are such that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> use of `` descartes s rule of signs '' shows that there are no real negative roots of the cubic there can be three or one real positive roots , depending on the relative magnitudes of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath75 , solutions are coplanar with the axis of rotation , one root is zero and the other two are @xmath76 . if @xmath77 , solutions are perpendicular to the axis of rotation , and there will be three real roots when @xmath78 , one real root otherwise . in the general case , it is a tedious but straightforward process to find all three roots in terms of the slope parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and explicitly reconstruct the parameters in terms of the roots .    </S>",
    "<S> for non - helical solutions to exist , both the cubic and @xmath81 must be non - negative . with three real roots , </S>",
    "<S> there are two branches of solutions with non - constant radius : an inner branch where @xmath81 is larger than the smallest root but smaller than the other two , and an outer branch where @xmath81 is larger than all three roots . with one real root </S>",
    "<S> , there is only an outer branch , where @xmath81 is larger than the real root . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the outer branch of the cubic will correspond to a configuration that is concave outward from the axis of rotation , and thus in a state of compressive stress . </S>",
    "<S> this may be easily seen algebraically for the coplanar case , where the outer branch corresponds to @xmath82 , which implies through that the stress is compressive . a compressive stress in corresponds to inherently unstable dynamics that are essentially impossible to observe in real life . </S>",
    "<S> so the important physical solutions are those of the inner branch , which only exists for sufficiently small relative values of @xmath80 such that the cubic discriminant is non - negative . </S>",
    "<S> this bound on one of the parameters was previously noted , through a different argument , in fusco s study of periodic , perpendicular - planar strings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inner branch coplanar solutions are the only spatial curves that touch the axis of rotation . </S>",
    "<S> explicit parametrizations of these curves are known , with @xmath40 expressed as a function of @xmath83 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> much of this behavior is more easily seen in phase portraits for @xmath81 , obtained from equation . </S>",
    "<S> four such portraits , displaying different choices of slope parameters , are shown in figure [ phaseportraits ] . </S>",
    "<S> they consist of a closed inner tensile lobe and open outer compressive lobe . increasing either parameter results in smaller lobes . </S>",
    "<S> the lobes merge into the line @xmath84 and a single parabola @xmath85 when both @xmath79 and @xmath80 go to zero ; this is the straight radial line solution . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of the @xmath1 coordinate as arc length constrains all trajectory curves to lie inside this parabola . </S>",
    "<S> the curves intersect the @xmath81 axis at the roots of the cubic . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ first ] , which looks like a fish , shows perpendicular - planar solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the inner lobe curves do not touch the @xmath86 axis for nonzero @xmath80 . for ( @xmath77 , @xmath87 ) the roots are ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) , and for ( @xmath88 ) the roots are ( @xmath89 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) . increasing @xmath79 as in figure [ second ] shrinks the lobes , the inner lobe shifting towards the @xmath86 axis ; the two smallest inner lobe curves have disappeared . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ third ] shows coplanar solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the inner lobe curves touch the @xmath86 axis , and do so with a generically nonzero slope @xmath23 , although @xmath91 when @xmath92 . for ( @xmath93 , @xmath87 ) </S>",
    "<S> the roots are ( 0 , 0 , 2 ) . increasing @xmath80 as in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fourth ] shrinks the lobes , the inner lobe shifting off of the @xmath86 axis ; the two smallest inner lobe curves have disappeared .     </S>",
    "<S> +    a few spatial curves are shown in figure [ menagerie ] . </S>",
    "<S> they resemble jump ropes for small @xmath80 and flower petals for small @xmath79 , and may be extended indefinitely to any length . </S>",
    "<S> any curve s chirality may be reversed to produce another solution , and rotation may occur in either sense , as changing the sign of @xmath14 does not affect the equations for @xmath83 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .     </S>",
    "<S> +     +    consider applying boundary conditions to an end of the string , at a given radius corresponding to a nondimensional squared radius @xmath94 that lies within one of the ranges allowed by the cubic . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the values of the axial and azimuthal slopes , respectively , and one must apply a nondimensional stress @xmath97 along the tangent . requiring periodicity of @xmath98 </S>",
    "<S> restricts the problem to the perpendicular plane @xcite , while requiring a vanishing radius yields only the coplanar solutions . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that a vanishing stress condition , such as would be found at a free end , is similarly restrictive for the corresponding problem in the presence of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> imposition of one or more of these conditions at the outset of considering this problem , or an augmented form of it , may thus lead to neglect of three - dimensional solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> although the slope parameters provide a natural description of the shapes , they do not correspond to experimentally imposable boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> perfectly flexible strings can not be clamped ; one can only fix some selection of radial , axial , and azimuthal positions of the two ends , by attaching them to rotating rigid supports that may have one or more degrees of freedom in their positions and orientations . </S>",
    "<S> these boundary conditions are connected to the slopes through integral relationships , and there is an additional global constraint on the total length of the string , all of which is implicitly encoded in equations ( [ radiusflow]-[phiimplicit ] ) . with length and some positions fixed by the scientist , </S>",
    "<S> the slopes and stress will be chosen by the physical system . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider only the tensile solutions , the closed orbits in @xmath81-@xmath86 space . </S>",
    "<S> choosing two radial positions within an appropriate region gives us , generically , a two - parameter continuous family of orbits on which solutions may be found . by subsequently choosing two additional constraints , we select a discrete family of solutions through the global relationships ( [ radiusflow]-[phiimplicit ] ) . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> one of the additional constraints is likely to be total length . </S>",
    "<S> the other could be total axial distance between the supports , or total azimuthal angular difference modulo @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> although the axial and azimuthal positions increase monotonically during traversal of an orbit , multiple solutions are still a possibility because we can not fix the number of turning points of the radius . </S>",
    "<S> this short study may be expanded in several ways . </S>",
    "<S> a logical next step , especially if one is concerned with industrial yarn problems , is to add a constant tangential velocity @xmath100 to the string so that @xmath101 and material elements move along the rigid shape . from mack </S>",
    "<S> s analysis @xcite , it appears that this will add terms proportional to @xmath102 inside the rightmost parentheses in equations . </S>",
    "<S> this will not change the order of equation , but should add new solutions _ via _ a third parameter in the equation that represents the relative strength of coriolis forces . </S>",
    "<S> this string problem contrasts with those that occur in inertial , non - rotating frames , where adding tangential motion leads only to centripetal forces . unlike coriolis forces </S>",
    "<S> , centripetal forces are balanced merely by a change in the stress @xcite , which does not modify the shapes of the solutions , but might stabilize some portion of those that would otherwise bear compressive stresses .    the addition of a uniform gravitational force along the axis of rotation will likely have the nontrivial effect of destroying the periodicity of @xmath83 , as the solutions of the corresponding geometrically linearized problem are bessel functions . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting set of non - rigid solutions to look for , perhaps using the rigid helical solutions as a starting point , are the `` subharmonic modes of rotation '' observed by caughey , `` in which the fixed end of the chain performs an integral number of rotations in the time that the free end takes to make one complete revolution '' @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent numerical work by aristoff and stone @xcite suggests that the addition of air drag to a coplanar solution , while keeping the boundary condition @xmath103 , leads to curvature singularities at the radial maxima . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of drag on rotating thin structures has direct relevance to the design of wind and water turbines . </S>",
    "<S> it is curious that , while the patent for the darrieus turbine @xcite cites a rotating rope s shape as that which will minimize the bending moments on a slender blade , the helical shape of this turbine s progeny , the gorlov turbine @xcite , was chosen for other reasons , apparently unrecognized as another choice that would satisfy the same criterion .    finally , those forbidden regions of phase space which correspond to negative @xmath81 might be explored by interpreting @xmath14 as imaginary , and considering a scattering problem for strings in a cylindrical potential . </S>"
