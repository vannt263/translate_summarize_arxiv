    "bound states of positrons with neutral atoms have not been detected experimentally yet . for a long time",
    "the prevailing view was that neutral atoms do not bind positrons . for example , aronson _",
    "et al _ @xcite proved that positron binding to hydrogen is not possible , and gertler _ et al _ @xcite showed that a ground - state helium atom could not bind a positron . in a number of calculations positron binding was observed for alkalis and second column atoms @xcite .",
    "however , important physical effects , such as virtual or real positronium ( ps ) formation , were neglected in those works . as a result ,",
    "the binding was largely considered as an artifact of the approximations used , or the positron bound states found were unstable against ps emission .",
    "this situation has clearly changed now .",
    "firstly , a many - body theory calculation by dzuba _ et al . _",
    "@xcite indicated that atoms with larger dipole polarizabilities and ionization potentials greater then 6.8 ev ( ps binding energy ) can bind positrons , and predicted positron binding energies for mg , zn , cd and hg . subsequently , a number of recent calculations have shown and even proved , for a few lighter atoms , that positron - atom bound states do exist , .    for the problem of positron - atom binding the atoms",
    "should be divided into two groups : those with the ionization potential @xmath1 smaller than 6.8 ev , and those with @xmath2 ev . for the former",
    "the lowest fragmentation threshold of the positron - atom system is that of a positive ion and a ps atom .",
    "consequently , positron binding to such atoms should rather be described as binding of the ps to the corresponding positive ion .",
    "indeed , the ` ion @xmath3 ps ' component in their wave function is large , as shown by the calculations for li-@xmath4 , na-@xmath4 and he@xmath5-@xmath4 @xcite . for atoms with @xmath2 ev the positron - atom bound state is indeed an ` atom @xmath3 @xmath4 ' system , at large positron - atom separations .",
    "however , the process of virtual ps formation in this system is very important @xcite , especially when @xmath1 is close to 6.8 ev .",
    "this effect makes positron - atom bound states a strongly correlated atomic system .",
    "the correlations in it are stronger than those one finds in its electron analogues , atomic negative ions .",
    "this feature makes the positron - atom bound complexes very interesting for the atomic theory .",
    "this also makes them a challenging testing ground for applications of modern numerical methods of atomic structure calculations .",
    "the main difficulty in calculations of positron interaction with atoms comes from the strong electron - positron coulomb attraction which leads to virtual positronium formation @xcite .",
    "one can say that it gives rise to a specific short - range attraction between the positron and the atom , in addition to the usual polarizational potential which acts between a neutral target and a charged projectile @xcite .",
    "this attraction can not be treated accurately by perturbations and some all - order technique is needed . in our earlier works",
    "@xcite we used the ps wave function explicitly to approximate the virtual ps - formation contribution to the positron - atom interaction .",
    "the same physics may also explain the success of the stochastic variation method in positron - atom bound state calculations ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) . in this approach",
    "the wave function is expanded in terms of explicitly correlated gaussian functions which include factors @xmath6 with interparticle distances @xmath7 . using this method ryzhikh and mitroy",
    "obtained positron bound states for a whole range of atoms with both @xmath8 ev ( li , na , and he@xmath5 ) , and @xmath2 ev ( be , mg , zn , cu , and ag ) .",
    "this method is well suited for few - particle systems .",
    "its application to heavier systems is done by considering the hamiltonian of the valence electrons and the positron in the model potential of the ionic core .",
    "however , for heavier atoms , e.g. , zn , the calculation becomes extremely time consuming @xcite , and its convergence can not be ensured .",
    "another non - perturbative technique is configuration interaction ( ci ) method widely used in standard atomic calculations .",
    "this method has been applied to the positron - copper bound state in @xcite . in this work",
    "the single - particle orbitals of the valence electron and positron are chosen as slater - type orbitals , and their interaction with the cu@xmath9 core is approximated by the sum of the hartree - fock and model polarization potentials .",
    "the calculation shows slow convergence with respect to the number of spherical harmonics included in the ci expansion , @xmath10 being still not sufficient to extrapolate the results reliably to @xmath11 .    in the present work",
    "we calculate the ground states of cu-@xmath4 and cu@xmath12 systems using a ci calculation within a spherical cavity of finite radius @xmath13 .",
    "this procedure facilitates the convergence of the ci expansion in the difficult positron - atom case , and we show how to extrapolate the results to the @xmath14 limit . the ci method which we use",
    "is based on the combined relativistic configuration interaction and many - body perturbation theory method ( ci+mbpt ) developed in our earlier work @xcite for precise calculations of many - electron atoms with more than one valence electron .",
    "it was shown there that correlations between the core and valence electrons are very important and often contribute more to the energy than the correlations between the valence electrons .",
    "the core - valence correlations are included into the effective ci hamiltonian of valence electrons by means of many - body perturbation theory .",
    "this allows us to achieve high accuracy in calculations of atomic energies and transition amplitudes . in the present work",
    "we adapt this approach to the positron problem .    as a single - particle basis for the ci calculations we use @xmath15-splined @xcite hartree - fock wave functions in the cavity of finite radius @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath15-spline technique has been successfully used in atomic calculations for many years ( see , e.g. , review @xcite ) and has been recently incorporated with the ci+mbpt method @xcite .",
    "the use of @xmath15-splines ensures good convergence of the ci calculation with respect to the number of radial orbitals .",
    "convergence is further controlled by varying the cavity radius , while the effect of a finite cavity size on the energy of the system is taken into account analytically .",
    "we have chosen the copper atom for the positron bound - state calculations for several reasons .",
    "first , this atoms looks like a good candidate for positron - atom bounding .",
    "it has a large polarizability of 40 a.u .",
    "@xcite , and its ionization potential @xmath16 ev @xcite is not too far from the ps binding energy of 6.8 ev , which ensures a sizable contribution of virtual ps to the positron - atom attraction .",
    "second , copper has a relatively simple electronic structure with only one valence electron above closed shells .",
    "this makes the positron - copper problem effectively a two - particle problem well suited for application of the ci+mbpt method .",
    "third , there are accurate experimental data and a number calculations for the energy of the copper negative ion .",
    "thus , we can test our method on cu@xmath12 and compare the results with those obtained by other techniques .",
    "last but not least , the existence of the positron - copper bound state was predicted by ryzhik and mitroy @xcite in the framework of the stochastic variational method , which allows us to compare the results obtained with the two different techniques .",
    "we use the relativistic hartree - fock method in the @xmath17 approximation to obtain the single - particle basis sets of electron and positron orbitals and to construct an effective hamiltonian . the main point for",
    "this choice is the simplicity of the mbpt , as discussed in ref .",
    "the self - consistent potential is determined for the cu@xmath9 ion and the single - particle states of the external valence electron and the positron are calculated in the field of the frozen core .    the two - particle electron - positron wave function is given by the ci expansion ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electron and positron orbitals respectively .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath21 are to be determined by the diagonalization of the matrix of the effective ci hamiltonian acting in the hilbert space of the valence electron and the positron , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 the effective single - particle hamiltonians of the electron and positron , and @xmath25 is the effective electron - positron two - body interaction . apart from the relativistic dirac operator , @xmath23 and @xmath24 include the direct and exchange hartree - fock potentials of the core electrons , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively",
    ". the additional @xmath28 operators account for correlations involving core electrons ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath29 using the second - order mbpt in the residual coulomb interaction .",
    "@xmath30 describes the interaction between the valence electron and the electrons of the core .",
    "all four second - order diagrams for the @xmath30 are presented in fig .",
    "[ sigmae ] .",
    "@xmath31 is the correlation interaction between the positron and the core . in the second - order @xmath31",
    "is represented by a sole digram in fig .",
    "[ sigmap ] .",
    "both operators are often called correlation _ potentials _ , because these _ non - local _ operators can be included into the equations for the single - particle orbitals together to the hartree - fock potential . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are energy - dependent operators , which are different for the electron and the positron .",
    "they are calculated separately for each partial wave , ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , etc . ) .",
    "however , at large distances both operators have the same asymptotic behaviour , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dipole polarizability of the atomic core .",
    "this asymptotic form comes from the dipole contribution of the first diagram in fig.[sigmae ] for the electron , and diagram in fig.[sigmap ] for the positron .",
    "formula ( [ alpha ] ) with some empirical cut - off at small distances is often used as an approximation for the correlation potentials , and is usually called ` polarization potential ' .",
    "@xmath37 is another type of correlations between the external particles and and core electrons .",
    "it can be described as screening of coulomb interaction between the external electron and positron by the core electrons .",
    "there are in all six second - order diagrams for @xmath37 .",
    "three of them are shown in fig .",
    "[ sigmaep ] .",
    "the other three can be obtained from them by mirror reflection with respect to the vertical axis .",
    "when the electron and the positron are well outside the atomic core @xmath37 is given by the following asymptotic expression , @xmath38 similarly to eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , this formula is often used to construct rough approximations for @xmath37 .",
    "such potentials are called ` di - electronic correction ' , or ` two - body polarization potential ' .",
    "diagrammatic expansions in figs .",
    "[ sigmae ] , [ sigmap ] and [ sigmaep ] enable one to include valence - core correlations in an _ ab initio _ manner . to increase the accuracy of the calculations",
    "higher - order contributions to @xmath29 can be taken into account effectively , by introducing a numerical factor before @xmath29 .",
    "for example , the coefficient for @xmath39 can be chosen by fitting the energies of the neutral atom states to the experimental data . in doing so",
    "the important non - local structure of the operators is preserved .",
    "we use @xmath15-spline basis functions @xcite to calculate the diagrams for @xmath28 and to construct the single - particle orbitals for the ci expansion ( [ c_i ] ) . for this purpose",
    "the atomic system is confined to a cavity of radius @xmath13 , and the wave functions are set to zero at @xmath40 . for a sufficiently large @xmath13 the error introduced by this boundary condition is very small for atomic - size binding energies , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is related to the binding energy as @xmath43 . however , for weakly bound states",
    ", e.g. those of the positron with the atom , this error has to be considered more carefully ( see below ) .",
    "the interval @xmath44 $ ] is divided into a number of segments and @xmath15-splines are constructed on them as piecewise polynomials of a certain degree .",
    "they are bell - shaped overlapping smooth functions . with an appropriate choice of the radial mesh",
    "they can approximate atomic wave functions to a very high precision .",
    "note that it is not convenient to use @xmath15-splines directly in ci or mbpt calculations because of their non - orthogonality .",
    "instead , we use their linear combinations which are eigenstates of the single - particle hartree - fock hamiltonian .",
    "this ensures orthogonality , allows to separate core and valence states and improves convergence , since only a relatively small number of lower hartree - fock eigenstates are sufficient for the convergence of the ci calculation .",
    "this also means that while we use the same @xmath15-splines for the electron and positron states the resulting single - particle basis states are different , because the hartree - fock hamiltonians for the electrons and positrons are different .",
    "another advantage of the use of @xmath15-splines is that the convergence can be controlled by the cavity radius @xmath13 ( its reduction leads to a more rapid convergence ) , while its effect on the energy is taken into account analytically .",
    "the choice of the cavity radius @xmath13 ( see above ) is dictated by a compromise between the convergence rate and the required accuracy of the calculations .",
    "on one hand , the radius must be large enough to accommodate the wave function of the state under investigation , e.g. , the positron - atom bound state .",
    "on the other hand , smaller radii mean faster convergence , both with respect to the number of radial orbitals and , which is especially important for positron - atom calculations , to the number of angular harmonics .",
    "this effect is very strong since convergence is determined by the cavity volume which is proportional to @xmath45 , and having a smaller radius means that one needs fewer basis states to describe the wave function .",
    "the problem of convergence is crucial for the positron - atom interaction .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the positron tends to form virtual ps with the external atomic electron @xcite .",
    "the positronium radius @xmath46 can be small compared to the characteristic size of the positron - atom bound state wave function , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the bohr radius . to describe ps at large separations from the atom expansion ( [ c_i ] )",
    "needs to be extended to very high values of angular momentum @xmath49 and principal quantum number @xmath50 to account accurately for the virtual ps formation .",
    "this problem is well known in positron - atom scattering calculations , see e.g. @xcite . smaller cavity radii force virtual ps to be at smaller distances , thereby improving the convergence significantly",
    ". however the energy of the system is affected .",
    "therefore , the convergence and the accuracy of the calculation can be really improved only if the effect of a finite - radius cavity on the energy is taken into account .    to consider the effect of cavity on the energy of the system",
    "let us consider the problem of a particle weakly bound in an @xmath51 state by a finite - range potential . `",
    "weakly bound ' here means that the binding energy is much smaller than the typical scale of the potential .",
    "this is definitely true for positron - atom bound states whose binding energy is much smaller than 1 ev . to determine the radial wave function @xmath52 at large distances it is sufficient to impose on it a boundary condition @xmath53 at the outer radius @xmath54 of the potential well @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 parameter is related to the energy of the bound state @xmath55 , and determines the asymptotic form of the wave function , @xmath56 .",
    "the boundary condition is unchanged when we place the system in the cavity of finite radius @xmath13 , @xmath57 , provided the energy of the bound state is still small .",
    "however , the wave function must now turn into zero at the cavity radius , @xmath58 .",
    "this shifts the energy of the weakly bound state up from @xmath59 to some other value @xmath60 , which depends on the radius of the cavity .",
    "the schrdinger equation for @xmath61 , where the potential is vanishingly small , is @xmath62 after solving it with boundary conditions ( [ ata ] ) and @xmath63 , one obtains a negative eigenvalue , @xmath64 , where @xmath65,\\ ] ] if @xmath13 is not too small , @xmath66 .",
    "as one can see , for @xmath14 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ elt0 ] ) , @xmath67 , approaches its asymptotic value @xmath42 , and the energy in the cavity @xmath68 . for a smaller cavity radius",
    "the eigenvalue becomes positive , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is found from @xmath71.\\ ] ] this means that the state which is bound may appear as unbound due to the effect of the cavity .",
    "equation ( [ egt0 ] ) is valid for @xmath72 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath73 , and the energy is too high , so that it remains positive even when the cavity wall is removed .    equations ( [ elt0 ] ) and ( [ egt0 ] ) can be used to find the infinite - cavity energy @xmath74 from the energy @xmath60 calculated for the finite cavity radius @xmath13 .",
    "it is important that these formulae are insensitive to the detailed shape of the atomic potential , and depend only on the atomic radius @xmath75 .",
    "the value of @xmath75 can be estimated from the position of the classical turning point @xmath76 , in the potential for an external atomic electron , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the effective quantum number of the valence electron . beyond the turning point",
    "the valence electron s wave function decreases exponentially , as @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , a resonable estimate for is @xmath80 for copper ( @xmath81 a.u .",
    ", @xmath82 ) this gives @xmath83 .",
    "a more accurate value of @xmath75 can be found by applying eq .",
    "( [ elt0 ] ) to two bound - state calculations performed with two different cavity radii @xmath13 .",
    "the uncertainly in the value of @xmath75 is in fact unimportant , as long as we consider weakly bound states for which @xmath84 .",
    "note that the wave function is also affected by the finite cavity size .",
    "this should be taken into account in calculations of the annihilation rate and other matrix elements .",
    "the annihilation rate is proportional to the probability of finding the positron close to the atom . for @xmath85",
    "the wave function at @xmath86 is affected via normalization only .",
    "the change of the normalization can be found by comparing the normalization integral for @xmath87 calculated numerically within the cavity , @xmath88 with the analytical value @xmath89",
    "to test the method and find out what accuracy can be achieved we first apply it to the copper negative ion .",
    "this is an effective two - particle problem technically very similar to the positron - copper interaction considered above .",
    "it should be mentioned that for cu@xmath12 only the electron @xmath29-operator is involved ( fig .",
    "[ sigmae ] ) , and for the screening of the electron - electron interaction , instead of the diagrams on fig .",
    "[ sigmaep ] , one must use similar diagrams presented in @xcite ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the results of calculations for cu and cu@xmath12 are presented in table [ cum ] together with the experimental values .",
    "the energies are given with respect to the cu@xmath9 core .",
    "the accuracy of the hartree - fock approximation is very poor .",
    "the binding energy of the @xmath90 electron in neutral cu is underestimated by about 20% , while the negative ion cu@xmath12 appears altogether unbound ( its energy lies above that of the neutral atom ) .",
    "the inclusion of core - valence correlations ( @xmath29 ) does improve the energy of the neutral atom , but the negative ion is still not bound .",
    "the standard ci method , in contrast , takes into account the valence - valence correlations , while neglecting the core - valence correlations",
    ". it does produce binding for the negative ion , but the binding energy is almost two times smaller than the experiment value .",
    "only when both core - valence and valence - valence correlations are included the accuracy improves significantly .",
    "it is equal to 2.6% for the ionization potential of the neutral atom and 10% for the electron affinity , which is quite good for a relatively simple _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "the remaining discrepancy is mostly due to third and higher - order correlation corrections in @xmath29 , since the configuration expansion for cu@xmath12 converges rapidly , and the corresponding error is small .    to simulate the effects of higher - order terms in @xmath29 and",
    "thus further improve the accuracy of calculations we introduce numerical factors before the @xmath30 operators to fit the lowest @xmath51 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 energy levels of the neutral copper atom .",
    "these factors are @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the @xmath51 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 channels , respectively .",
    "table [ cum ] shows that these factors also significantly improve the calculated electron affinity .",
    "it is natural to assume that the same procedure should work equally well for the positron - atom problem .",
    "results of other calculations of the electron affinity of copper are presented in table [ others ] .",
    "note that only a coupled - cluster ( cc ) method produces a result more accurate than ours .",
    "it is interesting to mention among other results the results by mitroy and ryzhikh @xcite who calculated cu@xmath12 for the same purpose as we do , i.e. , to gauge the accuracy of their method for the positron - atom problem",
    ". their first result for electron affinity to copper , 0.921 ev , was obtained by the stochastic variational method , while another result 0.916 ev was achieved in the standard ci calculation .",
    "both methods are variational in nature and differ basically by the form of the trial two - electron wave function .",
    "since the two results agree well with each other , good convergence has probably been achieved in both methods .",
    "however there is a noticeable discrepancy between their result and the experimental electron affinity value . from our point of view",
    "the most probable source of this discrepancy is approximate treatment of the @xmath28 operator of the valence - core interaction . in their works mitroy and ryzhikh",
    "use approximate expressions for the core polarization potentials , based on asymptotic formulae ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ alphas ] ) , which include only dipole core polarization in the local energy - independent form .",
    "note again that the actual @xmath28 operator is energy dependent .",
    "it is different for different angular momenta , and for the electron and positron , while approximate expression ( [ alpha ] ) is always the same .",
    "note also that the screening operator @xmath37 depends not only on the states involved but also on the multipolarity of the coulomb integral .",
    "approximate formula ( [ alphas ] ) describes the dipole part of screening only , however , other coulomb multipoles are also screened . even though the largest contribution to screening comes from the dipole term , monopole and quadrupole screening can not be neglected .",
    "for example , monopole screening directly contributes to the diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements in important configurations like @xmath96 in cu@xmath12 , while dipole screening affects only the off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "the binding energy of cu@xmath12 is about 0.045 a.u .",
    "it corresponds to a bound - state parameter @xmath97 , and the cavity does not have a noticeable effect on the calculated energies of cu@xmath12 , let alone cu .",
    "the relative error introduced by the cavity can be easily estimated from eq .",
    "( [ elt0 ] ) , and even for a moderate @xmath98 it does not exceed 0.1% for the electron affinity .    for the positron bound state",
    "the situation is different . as indicated by the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath42 value for the cu-@xmath4 bound state is about 0.1 .",
    "this is why we have performed the calculation of the positron - atom bound state using two different cavity radii , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , to make sure that convergence is really achieved .",

    "saturation can be clearly achieved for both radii at @xmath105 .",
    "the difference in energy at the last ( lowest ) points for @xmath98 and @xmath99 in both figures is the effect of a finite cavity radius .",
    "it shifts the energy obtained in the @xmath98 calculation up with respect to the @xmath99 result .",

    ". however , the relevant uncertainty must be considerably smaller .",
    "firstly , we saw that the use of fitting parameters really improves the calculated electron affinity of copper .",
    "we should expect the same effect for the positron binding energy .",
    "secondly , the effects of the fitting parameters on the electron and positron operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 largely cancel each other .",
    "* incompleteness of the basis set .",
    "we have seen from figs [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] that the level of convergence achieved is very high and the corresponding uncertainty is small .",
    "nevertheless , there is a hidden uncertainty related to the radial coordinate mesh used , the number of splines and other parameters which determine the details of the numerical procedure .",

    "this effect on the binding energy calculated at @xmath99 is very small ( @xmath109 0.0001 a.u . ) . since the results for",
    "@xmath98 and @xmath99 coincide for very reasonable value of the positron - atom potential radius @xmath106 , it is reasonable to believe that the corresponding uncertainty is very small too .",
    "note that the difference between our calculated electron affinity of copper and the experimental value is 0.00066 a.u .",
    "if this value is compared with the numbers presented above , it is evident that it also gives a reasonable estimate of the accuracy of the calculation of the positron - copper binding energy ( about 10% ) . since the accuracy of calculations by mitroy and ryzhikh @xcite is not discussed in their paper the only thing we can do to estimate it is to use the same approach . their best result for cu@xmath12 differs from the experimental value by 0.0116 a.u .",
    "( 20% of the positron binding energy ) .",

    "<S> a new relativistic method for calculation of positron binding to atoms is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the method combines a configuration interaction treatment of the valence electron and the positron with a many - body perturbation theory description of their interaction with the atomic core . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this method to positron binding by the copper atom and obtain the binding energy of 170 mev ( @xmath0 ) . to check the accuracy of the method we use a similar approach to calculate the negative copper ion . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated electron affinity is 1.218 ev , in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.236 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of convergence of positron - atom bound state calculations is investigated , and means to improve it are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic character of the method and its satisfactory convergence make it a suitable tool for heavier atoms . </S>"
