    "brownian motors can be described as prototype models for the bio - molecular motors in biological cells that work out of thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "most research in this area is devoted to normal classical ratchet transport , where both the mean position and the position variance grow linearly in time , i.e. @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . at the same time , anomalous diffusion and transport @xcite become increasingly popular as indicated by huge literature produced during the last 20 years ( see e.g. recent overview papers in @xcite and fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite therein ) .",
    "experimental works discover that both viscoelasticity of dense polymer solutions @xcite and colloids @xcite such as e.g. cytosol of biological cells @xcite , and spatial inhomogeneity and disorder @xcite in such media can entail subdiffusion , @xmath2 , with a power law exponent @xmath3 .",
    "this naturally inspires the question on how can natural molecular motors operate in such crowded environments featured by a large macroscopic ( zero - frequency ) viscosity which causes subdiffusion of macromolecules on a transient mesoscopic spatial ( several micrometers ) and time ( up to several minutes ) scales @xcite .",
    "in fact , such transient transport phenomena are faster on mesoscopic scales than one expects @xcite for such highly viscous media from their effective macroscopic viscosity coefficient which depends on the brownian particle size @xcite . to clarify the problem requires first to generalize well known toy brownian ratchets models such as rocking ratchet or flashing ratchet towards anomalous viscoelastic dynamics with memory .",
    "the first related steps were done recently in refs .",
    "@xcite for rocking ratchets , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for flashing ratchets within the framework of nonlinear generalized langevin equation ( gle ) approach @xcite applied to viscoelastic stochastic dynamics with memory within a generalized maxwell - langevin markovian multi - dimensional embedding dynamics @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that such viscoelastic rocking ratchets are genuine ratchets capable to sustain a sufficient load in the direction opposite to rectified motion and perform thus a useful work . moreover ,",
    "an optimal subdiffusive ratchet transport reflects synchronization between the potential periodic tilts and advancing the brownian particle over one or two spatial substrate periods in the transport direction .",
    "such a synchronization can be interpreted as stochastic resonance occurring in a highly non - markovian dynamics upon a thermal noise intensity variation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a synchronization between the potential periodic flashes and nonlinear oscillations within the potential wells is responsible for an optimization of the ratchet transport in the case of flashing ratchets @xcite .",
    "clearly , similar features are simply impossible within an alternative subdiffusive transport mechanism based on continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) with divergent mean residence times in traps or associated fractional fokker - planck dynamics ( ffpd ) @xcite",
    ". moreover , such anomalous transport can be low dispersive , with large or even diverging ( for vanishingly small temperature , cf . in @xcite ) generalized peclet number , which presents the ratio of scaled sub - velocity and sub - diffusion coefficient .",
    "this is in a sharp contrast with highly dispersive ctrw and ffpd transport featured by a vanishing generalized peclet number @xcite . in spite of these recent advances ,",
    "many important fundamental questions remain but open . in particular , in our previous works @xcite the inertial effects in the anomalous ratchet transport were very essential .",
    "will the anomalous ratchet transport persist also in the overdamped limit , where the inertial effects are entirely neglected ?",
    "this is the first important question which is answered in affirmative with this work . the second important question concerns thermodynamic efficiency of such anomalous isothermal anomalous brownian motors .",
    "namely , which portion of the energy provided by an external field for transport can be transformed into a useful work against a load ?",
    "do the conventional notion of power , i.e. the work done per unit of time , remains meaningful for anomalous transport , or it requires a generalization ?",
    "this is one of fundamental questions which we address in this work for anomalous ratchet transport .    in this article ,",
    "we study subdiffusive _ overdamped _ brownian motors operating in viscoelastic media and periodically rocked by an external force .",
    "it will be shown that subdiffusive current can be optimized with the driving frequency and temperature also in the overdamped limit .",
    "such anomalous ratchets can be characterized by a very good transport quality ( coherence ) at sufficiently low temperatures in spite of the anomalous character of transport .",
    "studying dependence of subvelocity on load we will show that the considered brownian ratchet is a genuine one .",
    "it does a useful work against a load and we find the corresponding thermodynamic efficiency which turns out to be a slowly decaying function of time .",
    "this is because the energy pumped into rectified motion scales linearly with time , but the subdiffusive transport is sublinear .",
    "nevertheless , this efficiency is not vanishingly small and it compares well with the efficiency of the corresponding normal diffusion ratchets on the time scale of simulations , which is a surprise .",
    "let us consider the following model of anomalous brownian motion . a brownian particle moving with velocity @xmath4 in a dense water solution of polymers ( e.g. cytosol of biological cells ) experiences stokes memoryless friction with friction coefficient @xmath5 ( corresponding to water ) and , in addition",
    ", a frequency - dependent friction with memory which is characterized by a fractional friction coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "it corresponds to a polymeric fluid . considering a general case of linear friction with memory , @xmath7 , for a particle starting its motion at @xmath8 , the normal contribution corresponds to the memory kernel @xmath9 and frictional force , @xmath10 , whilst an anomalous one emerges for @xmath11 , where @xmath3 and @xmath12 is gamma - function .",
    "the corresponding term with memory , which captures e.g. viscoelastic effects , can be abbreviated as @xmath13 using the notion of fractional caputo derivative , just per its definition @xcite . in accordance with the second fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt )",

    "the motion is driven also by an external periodic force @xmath24 with amplitude @xmath25 and driving frequency @xmath26 .",
    "the fdt ( [ fdt ] ) ensures so that the energy dissipated is always balanced by the energy gained from the environment at the thermal equilibrium ( @xmath27 ) so that there is no net heat exchange and the kinetic degree of freedom has energy @xmath28 on average .",

    "next , we follow to the road of markovian embedding in refs . @xcite and approximate the memory kernel by a sum of exponentials , @xmath42 and the corresponding noise @xmath15 by a sum of ornstein - uhlenbeck processes . by choosing",
    "the spectrum of relaxation rates scaled as @xmath43 via a maximal relaxation rate @xmath44 and a scaling parameter @xmath45 the corresponding power dependence @xmath46 can be nicely approximated over about @xmath47 time decades between two time cutoffs @xmath48 and @xmath49 . to ensure a power law scaling one chooses @xmath50 , or @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a numerical fitting constant which mostly depends on @xmath53 and @xmath54 for a sufficiently large @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "weak dependences of @xmath55 on @xmath56 and @xmath54 ensure a very powerful numerical approach to integrate fractional stochastic non - markovian dynamics with a well - controlled numerical accuracy ( of several percents in this work ) .",
    "alternatively , it can be considered as an independent approach to anomalous transport which is even not bounded by a strict requirement on the power scaling .",
    "approximation of the memory kernel by a sum of exponentials can be derived from an experiment , see a practical example in fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the sum of just four exponentials suffices to fit a power law memory kernel extending over four time decades .",
    "this approach allows also for a vivid physical interpretation in terms of viscoelastic forces @xmath57 caused by overdamped brownian particles modeling viscoelastic degrees of freedom of the environment and corresponding to viscoelastic deformations of the medium ( principal modes ) .",
    "these auxiliary quasi - particles are elastically attached to the transport particle with spring constants @xmath58 and subjected to stokes frictional forces with frictional constants @xmath59 .",
    "this leads to the following markovian embedding dynamics with uncorrelated white noise sources , @xmath60 : @xmath61 initial @xmath62 must be thermally ( gaussian ) distributed around @xmath63 , with @xmath64 ^ 2\\rangle = t / k_i$ ] , in order to have complete equivalence with above gle description for a memory kernel being a sum of exponentials , which is , of course , an approximation to the considered power - law memory kernel @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation is , however , well controlled .",
    "we do the corresponding sampling of @xmath62 below . otherwise , there would be a transient force present in gle reflecting thermal equilibration of the medium disturbed initially by the brownian particle ( e.g. upon its insertion ) , or corresponding aging effects @xcite .",
    "the general presence of such transients adds a flexibility to this modeling approach .",
    "however , we shall not consider such transient aging effects because we are interested in an asymptotic transport regime , which is not influenced by initial transients .",
    "thereafter we fix @xmath65 and choose @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "most presented below results were obtained using an ensemble averaging over @xmath69 trajectories .",
    "simulations are done with the help of the stochastic heun method @xcite on the graphical processor units ( gpus ) with double precision @xcite .",
    "this technique provided an effective acceleration of numerics by a factor of about 100 for the studied system over the standard cpus computing on modern commodity processors .",

    "the number of auxiliary particles was fixed to @xmath72 .    as discussed previously @xcite , @xmath56",
    "auxiliary particles can be roughly divided into the groups of fast , @xmath73 , and slow @xmath74 particles .",
    "this division can be made upon comparison of the mean time of transitions made by central brownian particle to the neighboring potential well with the relaxation times @xmath75 of the corresponding viscoelastic force components @xmath76 .",
    "fast medium s deformations move together with the brownian particle , forming together a quasi - particle .",
    "it reminds polaron in condensed matter physics , i. e. a naked particle plus deformation of its nearest environment which are considered together as a compound particle .",
    "mean viscoelastic force created by such a nearest environment equals to zero on average on the time scale of slow motion .",
    "however , the most sluggish deformations temporally imprint the medium s memory about the previous particle s positions and create a quasi - elastic slow varying retarding force acting in the direction opposite to the transport direction .",
    "these viscoelastic deformations introduce long - lived negative correlations in the particle displacements .",
    "such a mechanism leads to anomalously slow diffusion and transport with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , where @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding subdiffusion coefficient @xmath80 and the subvelocity @xmath81 are defined as follows : @xmath82 the limit should be understood as a physical limit in the following sense : @xmath33 is large but yet much smaller than the time cutoff @xmath83 . the latter time scale is made not attainable ( and thus irrelevant ) in our simulations . to characterize the coherence and the quality of the transport we shall use a generalized peclet number @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "such a peclet number is a natural quantifier for the coherence quality of stochastic transport in periodic potentials .",
    "it measures the ratio of the mean traveling distance @xmath85 ( in units of @xmath23 ) to the diffusional spread @xmath86 ( in units of @xmath87 ) @xcite .",
    "first , we tested numerics and compared the results for the ensemble - averaged position variance @xmath88 with the exact result in the absence of potential which can be readily obtained from a general expression for the considered particular case of gle , see in @xcite , using the laplace transform of generalized mittag - leffler function from ref .",

    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "it has been shown previously for subdiffusive dynamics with inertial effects @xcite that a periodic potential does not influence the variance @xmath88 and the corresponding subdiffusion coefficient @xmath80 in the asymptotical limit .",
    "this was named a universality class of viscoelastic subdiffusion in tilted periodic potentials in refs .",
    "this remarkable property is also valid for the overdamped ratchets considered in this work .",
    "the explanation is also similar : most sluggish viscoelastic modes of the environment determine the asymptotic character of subdiffusion not being affected by external static fields .",
    "strong time - periodic fields can make some influence on viscoelastic subdiffusion pumping energy into the system at some rate . however , this influence was not strong even in the presence of inertial effects @xcite , as figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] also illustrate for the inertia - free dynamics . for a sufficiently large driving frequency @xmath26",
    "some deviation from the force - free subdiffusion coefficient , @xmath110 , occurs in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . however , it is not appreciably strong .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that an increase in viscous friction @xmath5 leads to extension of the initial normal diffusion regime .",
    "in contrast to the case studied earlier @xcite there is no ballistic regime here due the absence of inertial effects .",
    "initially diffusion is normal , @xmath111 , in accordance with above analysis .",
    "finally , on a large time scale diffusion becomes anomalous , @xmath112 .",
    "normal friction does not affect this asymptotics , leading merely to increase of the transition time @xmath103 ( compare dash - dot , solid and dash curves in fig.[fig1 ] ) .    to check if the considered dynamics is ergodic , in accordance with previous studies of viscoelastic subdiffusion in periodic potentials , we computed a time - average @xmath113 of the squared displacement , @xmath114 ^ 2 dt',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] over single trajectories @xcite . here , the total integration time @xmath115 is chosen much larger than the maximal time @xmath116 for the ensemble - averaged trajectories @xmath117 .",
    "we used @xmath118 in our calculations .",
    "the underlying idea of ergodicity is that the time average of a quantity , here squared particle displacements within a time interval of length @xmath33 is equal to a corresponding ensemble average . in other words ,",
    "a moving time - average of the squared displacement should coincide with the ensemble - average . comparing solid and dotted curves in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath119",
    "one can conclude that this indeed is the case .",
    "the diffusion is clearly ergodic on the considered time scale .      to compute the frequency - dependence @xmath120 we have chosen several different values of temperature @xmath18 and normal friction coefficient @xmath5 , and varied the driving frequency @xmath26 in the window @xmath121 $ ] at fixed amplitude @xmath122 .",
    "the results for the anomalous current ( subvelocity @xmath81 ) as a function of driving frequency @xmath26 are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the occurrence and frequency dependence of the rectification effect is particularly interesting in the considered overdamped dynamics . in the presence of inertial effects , rectification ratchet effect is suppressed in the adiabatic frequency limit @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "this reflects the universality class of anomalous gle sub - transport in washboard potentials and is very different from the normal diffusion case , where the rectification effect for the fluctuating tilt ratchets is maximal namely in the discussed limit @xcite .",
    "one expects that this anomalous feature survives also for overdamped dynamics , as fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indeed confirms .",
    "further , let us compare the influence of temperature and driving frequency on the subvelocity @xmath120 at the fixed @xmath124 ( see curves with filled circles and squares for small and intermediate temperatures , respectively ) . for the tested values of temperature",
    "the subcurrent indeed optimizes with the driving frequency .",
    "increase in temperature leads to decrease in the maximal value of subvelocity and to shift of the optimal driving frequency towards larger values .",
    "the qualitative explanation of these effects is similar to one for subdiffusive ratchets with inertial effects @xcite . with increasing temperature",
    "the role of trapping potential diminishes ( transport is absent in the absence of ratchet potential ) , and the mean time to escape out of potential well decreases .",
    "we expect that the optimal frequency also corresponds to a stochastic resonance ( sr ) effect , similar to one in ref .",
    "@xcite , when the mean frequency of jumps in the transport direction synchronizes with the corresponding potential tilts .",
    "this question was not studied , however , in more detail for the case considered .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown for the inertial case that an increase in the driving frequency can lead to the subcurrent inversion , where the transport occurs in the counterintuitive direction .",
    "the corresponding driving frequency is of the order of magnitude of the inverse anomalous relaxation time constant of the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath125 , in the presence of inertial effects .",
    "it depends on the mass of brownian particle @xmath126 .",
    "we considered here , however , an overdamped limit , @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "for this reason , it is _ a priori _ not clear if the inversion of transport direction can occur also in the complete absence of inertial effects .",
    "numerics do reveal such an inversion for a sufficiently large frequency .",
    "however , the corresponding characteristic time scale is given now not by the velocity relaxation time constant @xmath129 , but by the time scale of intrawell coordinate relaxation @xmath130 .",
    "such an inversion is similar to one detected for normal diffusion ratchets in ref .",
    "for small @xmath131 , it is primarily determined by the anomalous relaxation time constant @xmath132 , i. e. @xmath133 .",
    "an increase in @xmath5 decelerates the intrawell relaxation process and leads to an increase in the effective relaxation time , which becomes proportional to @xmath5 , @xmath134 , in the normal diffusion limit @xmath135 . for this reason ,",
    "a critical inversion frequency , @xmath136 , should decrease with the increase in @xmath5 at fixed @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , an increase in temperature should also increase the relaxation rate leading to a larger value of @xmath138 .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are consistent with this explanation and show the corresponding tendencies .      given a subthreshold driving , we are dealing with a thermal noise assisted ratchet transport .",
    "thermal noise is necessary to overcome the potential barriers and therefore subtransport vanishes in the limit of zero temperature , @xmath139 .",
    "it vanishes also for a large temperature @xmath140 , when the potential ceases to matter .",
    "therefore , an optimization with temperature is expected , also for the inverted transport regime .",
    "indeed numerics reveal such an optimization clearly , see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for different parameters and different regimes .",
    "dependency on frequency @xmath26 for the same @xmath5 implies for sufficiently small @xmath26 ( not shown ) that the maximum versus temperature corresponds to a stochastic resonance ( sr ) , when the overbarrier jumps synchronize with the potential tilts in the transport direction , like in the presence of inertial effects @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of such a non - markovian sr for overdamped dynamics was , however , not done .",
    "it is left for a separate study .",
    "the coherence quality of the overdamped transport , as measured by the generalized peclet number @xmath141 , can also be rather high , like in the presence of inertial effects .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows this clearly for @xmath81 in fig .",
    "this is an expected result since @xmath142 .",
    "because of this the considered non - markovian stochastic coherence resonance is shifted to smaller values of optimal @xmath18 as compare with sr .",
    "the next question we address is whether the subtransport can be further optimized by a variation of @xmath5 for a maximal value of @xmath81 in fig .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "they reveal that this dependence on @xmath5 is rather weak , even if a minor optimization does take place ",
    "see insert in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "finally we come to clarifying the question whether the studied anomalous ratchets can do any useful work and how big can be their thermodynamic efficiency .",
    "this question is not a trivial issue at all since friction can and does play a useful role , contrary to intuition which can mislead .",
    "not understanding the essence of the thermal fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) can drive and mislead research into a wrong direction by tempting to eliminate the dissipative effects overall and concentrating on the limit of the so - called frictionless or hamiltonian ratchets .",
    "friction is always associated with dissipative losses and one can believe that a complete elimination of friction will result in a most efficient motor .",
    "however , the fdt says that at thermal equilibrium the energy dissipated in motion of a brownian particle by friction is regained due to absorption of energy obtained from thermal random forces , so that the both processes are balanced at the thermal equilibrium , where the total heat exchange between the particle and its environment is absent .",
    "for example , isothermal biological molecular motors can work in spite of a strong friction at thermodynamic efficiency close to one ( though then infinitely slow , at power close to zero ) @xcite .",
    "however , subdiffusion introduces new features .",
    "phenomenologically , it can be characterized by an effectively increasing in time viscous friction .",
    "indeed , let us do for a minute an _ ad hoc _",
    "markovian approximation in gle ( [ gle1 ] ) by replacing @xmath143 with @xmath144 in the memory friction integral ( the explicit form of the term formally written with use of the caputo fractional derivative ) .",
    "then , dissipative part of this equation is characterized by an infinitely increasing in time effective friction @xmath145 .",
    "this is a simplest way to understand the origin of subdiffusion and subtransport in physical terms ( though generally one has to be very careful with such an _ ad hoc _ approximation , especially in the presence of inertial effects ) .",
    "even if the effective friction increases indefinitely in time , such a ratchet does a useful work against a load and is characterized by a finite stopping force , see in fig .",
    "similar was shown also in the presence of inertial effects , see fig . 5 in ref .",
    "the numerics are well described by a simple analytical dependence @xmath146 which can be inferred by a linear response argumentation given the asymptotical independence of the subtransport on the presence of periodic potential in the static case , @xmath147 .",
    "the presence of the factor @xmath148 is due to the used scaling of nondimensional variables .",
    "is also the thermodynamic efficiency finite ? we define it in a standard way as a portion of input energy @xmath149 put into a useful work @xmath150 done against the loading force @xmath30 , i. e. @xmath151 . to find this quantity we following to the ideas presented in @xcite and first rewrite eq .",
    "( [ gle1 ] ) as a force balance equation @xmath152 where , @xmath153 , is the periodic potential force acting on the particle ( stator potential ) , and @xmath154 is the total stochastic viscoelastic force acting on the particle from the side of environment . multiplying the force balance equation ( [ force ] ) by @xmath144 , integrating it within the time interval @xmath155 , and averaging over a bunch of trajectories",
    "( time averaging is also appropriate since the considered dynamics is ergodic ) one obtains the following energy balance equation @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the change of internal energy of the considered brownian motor ( which is bounded ) , @xmath158 is the heat exchanged between the motor particle and its environment , @xmath159 is the work done by the external force on the whole system , or input energy provided by it .",
    "this input energy is used to do a useful work @xmath160 against a load . for a large @xmath33 ,",
    "the fluctuating change of internal energy is negligible and we have @xmath161 thermodynamic efficiency is @xmath151 .",
    "notice that this efficiency is zero when an external loading force is absent .",
    "then all the external work done is dissipated as heat absorbed by the environment . at thermal equilibrium",
    "the total heat exchange is absent , @xmath162 .",
    "this is expression of fdt , which is guaranteed by the fdt condition for gle . the efficiency of brownian motors",
    "is therefore maximized when they are operating mostly close to the thermal equilibrium , to minimize the heat losses .",
    "theoretically , efficiency can reach value of one ( if to operate very slowly at almost zero power ) , and some biological molecular motors can indeed be very efficient , by operating in multiple small steps @xcite .",
    "this is a textbook wisdom @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of subtransport presents new features .",
    "since the transport is subdiffusive , the useful work scales sublinearly in time , @xmath163 , for a sufficiently large @xmath33 .",
    "we can name the coefficient @xmath164 subpower , or fractional power .",
    "it replaces for anomalous motors the notion of power , i.e. the work done per unit of time .",
    "the averaged energy pumped by a periodically changing in time force scales , however , linearly with time , @xmath165 , i.e. with a number of oscillations done , see in fig .",
    "it can be characterized by a pumping power @xmath166 .",
    "for this reason , thermodynamics efficiency decays in time as @xmath167 , with @xmath168 .",
    "one can name @xmath169 fractional efficiency . despite this decaying character : ( 1 ) the useful work and sub - power are always finite in the presence of a load bounded by @xmath170 , ( 2 )",
    "efficiency decays algebraically slowly and compares well with the efficiency of normal fluctuating tilt ratchets on the time scale of simulations . in this respect ,",
    "the efficiency of normal ratchets estimated for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite was as low as @xmath171 .",
    "fluctuating tilt ratchets operate as isothermal brownian machines rather poor .",
    "this is a well known fact . for larger values of @xmath53 ,",
    "say for @xmath172 , considered subdiffusive ratchets would operate with a very slow decaying efficiency , @xmath173 , on a very long time scale .",
    "this again confirms that even an infinitely strong effective friction ( in a naive markovian approximation assuming a strict subdiffusion ) is not an obstacle for thermodynamical efficiency , paradoxically enough .",
    "now we are able to provide a very simple theory for subpower coefficient @xmath174 and the fractional efficiency coefficient @xmath169 . clearly , because of @xmath175 and eq .",

    "( [ diss_force ] ) .",
    "it is , @xmath180 , or @xmath181 .",
    "the definition of the generalized efficiency given in @xcite for normal diffusion ratchet is @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the useful power , and @xmath184 is the steady - state averaged squared motor velocity .",
    "@xmath185 is just averaged power of dissipation losses caused by the macroscopic stokes friction @xmath186 .",
    "another related option proposed is @xcite is to use @xmath187 instead of @xmath184 , i.e. to neglect the velocity fluctuations @xmath188 in calculating work done against the frictional forces .",
    "the stokes efficiency is obtained by setting @xmath189 .",
    "this corresponds to zero loading force , @xmath190 . though in @xcite it was defined differently as @xmath191 .",
    "a generalization of ( [ dba ] ) to the present case should read @xmath192 where @xmath193 .",
    "a different generalization in the spirit of @xcite would amount to replacing @xmath194 with @xmath195 and @xmath196 with @xmath197 in the last expression .",
    "we shall not consider these various generalizations further in the present paper but notice that the _ total _ dissipative force acting from the environment on the motor particle is yet @xmath179 .",
    "it includes also the randomly fluctuating forces . by the third law of newton the particle exerts on the environment the force @xmath198 and the averaged work done by this force on the environment just equals to the heat losses @xmath199 .",
    "therefore , a natural definition for the generalized stokes efficiency would be just @xmath200 .",
    "it equals 100 % in the absence of load and approaches this maximal value even in the presence of load asymptotically for the studied anomalous ratchets . in other words , the work on translocation of a cargo in such a highly dissipative viscoelastic environment is done mostly against resistance of this environment .",
    "this is a natural conclusion .",
    "we studied a model of overdamped subdiffusive ratchets rocked by a time - periodic force in viscoelastic media characterized by a power - law decaying memory kernel .",
    "the brownian motor particle is subjected to viscous friction and white thermal noise .",
    "viscoelastic medium s degrees of freedom were modeled by auxiliary brownian particles that are elastically coupled to the central brownian particle .",
    "some of these auxiliary brownian particles are extremely slow .",
    "they imprint memory about former positions of the central brownian particle and create a retarding viscoelastic force causing anomalous diffusion and transport .",
    "just a handful of such auxiliary brownian particles suffices to model subdiffusion and subtransport on practically any experimentally relevant time scale .",
    "our setup is fully equivalent to a generalized langevin equation , where the memory kernel and random force of environment are related by the fluctuation - dissipation relation at ambient temperature of the environment .",
    "the setup of our modeling is ergodic and the brownian motor subvelocity can be found from a single particle trajectory , though an ensemble averaging over @xmath69 particles has been done to obtain most results presented .",
    "subdiffusive current is optimized with the frequency of periodical driving and temperature .",
    "it depends also on the viscous friction acting directly on the motor particle . however , the subdiffusion coefficient depends weakly on other parameters being linearly proportional to temperature within the model of temperature - independent friction .",
    "the directed ratchet subtransport can possess thus at low temperature a very good quality , as characterized by the generalized peclet number @xmath201 .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the considered anomalous brownian motors are able to sustain a substantial load and do a useful work which scales sublinearly with time and can be characterized by subpower .",
    "since the energy pumped by the external time - periodic force scales linearly with time the motor efficiency decays algebraically in time .",
    "it can , however , favorably agree with the efficiency of the normal brownian motors of the kind considered on an appreciably long time intervals .",
    "we provided a simple theory for thermodynamic efficiency of anomalous brownian motors which agrees remarkably well with the numerical results obtained .",
    "we expect that nontrivial results obtained in this work will stimulate a further cross - fertilization between the fields of anomalous diffusion and transport and the field of fluctuation - induced transport in the absence of a biasing on average force",
    ". a further generalization of the model presented here towards flashing potential ratchets opens a way to treat operation of molecular motors in such viscoelastic environments as cytosol of biological cells .",
    "the corresponding work is in progress .",
