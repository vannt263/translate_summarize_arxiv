    "much of the theoretical and experimental interest has been recently devoted to the study of the production of heavy quarks in hadronic collisions . on the theoretical side the calculation in perturbative qcd of the differential and total cross sections to order",
    "@xmath6 has been performed by two groups  @xcite , providing a firm basis for a detailed study of the properties of the bottom and charm quarks , and leading to reliable predictions for the production rate of the top quark  @xcite .",
    "these results do however present a non - negligible residual renormalization / factorization scale dependence , particularly at large @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the validity of this next - to - leading ( nlo ) @xmath4 calculation is limited when @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the large quark mass , by the appearance of potentially large logarithms of the type @xmath2 , which have to be resummed to all orders .",
    "the physical reason for that is quite clear .",
    "for example , terms of order @xmath9 or @xmath10 are simply related to the mass singularities originating from collinear configurations when @xmath11 for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty associated to those corrections has been roughly estimated in  @xcite . whereas for top quark production this uncertainty is irrelevant , this is not the case for the production of bottom and charm quarks at large @xmath0 , leading to relevant phenomenological consequences .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a solution to this problem , namely we study the behaviour of the differential cross section for the production of heavy quarks in the limit @xmath12 , to nlo accuracy . to this aim",
    "we follow an approach based on the properties of fragmentation of a generic parton @xmath13 in the heavy quark @xmath14 , after the parton has been produced inclusively in the hard collision of the two initial hadrons .",
    "the basic formula is represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fact ] ) , where the partonic cross sections @xmath15 at @xmath4 have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite in the massless quark limit .",
    "@xmath15 introduces an explicit dependence on @xmath0 and on renormalization / factorization mass scales . the dependence on the heavy quark mass",
    "is then obtained through the fragmentation function of the parton @xmath16 , evolved at nlo accuracy from an initial scale @xmath17 ( see below ) to @xmath18 .",
    "this approach explicitly resums potentially large terms ot the kind @xmath19^n$ ] , giving a better description of the theoretical predictions at large @xmath0 .",
    "indeed the corresponding uncertainty is quite reduced in this region with respect to the perturbative result , due to a significantly smaller sensitivity to the relevant scales . on the other hand , because of the massless limit used for the @xmath4 kernel cross sections @xmath15 , this approach does not allow to recover in a simple way the limit @xmath20 of the perturbative calculation .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our approach to @xmath3-quark production , the application to charm production will be given elsewhere . in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] we give the general formalism . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] we first discuss the basic ingredients necessary to obtain our nlo cross sections and then we present our results .",
    "we compare with the perturbative calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite and study in detail the dependence on the various mass scales entering the problem .",
    "our conclusions are finally given in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] .",
    "according to factorization theorems  @xcite the cross section for the inclusive hadroproduction of a hadron at high transverse momentum , i.e. for the process @xmath21 can be written as = _ i , j , kx_1",
    "x_2 x_3 f_h_1^i(x_1,_f ) f_h_2^j(x_2,_f ) _",
    "ijkx(x_1,x_2,_r,_f ) d_k^h_3(x_3,_f ) [ eq : fact ] as usual , the @xmath22 s are the distribution functions of the partons in the colliding hadrons , @xmath23 is the kernel cross section and @xmath24 is the fragmentation function of the observed hadron . the factorization mass scales @xmath25 of the structure and fragmentation functions are assumed to be equal for the sake of simplicity .",
    "@xmath26 is the renormalization scale .    due to the presence of collinear singularities both in the initial and final state",
    "this process is not fully predictable by qcd itself .",
    "we can actually calculate the kernel cross section and the evolution of the structure and fragmentation functions , but we have to rely on some phenomenological input to obtain the latter at some given initial scale .",
    "this situation changes drastically when we come to consider the inclusive production of a heavy quark . in this case",
    "its mass , being finite and considerably greater than @xmath27 , makes the perturbative expansion feasible and prevents collinear singularities from appearing in the splitting vertices which involve the heavy quark .    having this in mind",
    "two approaches can be pursued in the calculation of heavy quark production .",
    "the first one is to directly calculate in perturbation theory the process @xmath28 , q being the heavy quark and @xmath29 the initial state _ light",
    "_ partons ( i.e. light quarks and gluons ) .",
    "this kernel cross section will then be convoluted with initial state structure functions only , the final state showing no singularities of any kind .",
    "this approach has been followed in the past  @xcite , providing a full perturbative @xmath30 ) calculation . in the following we shall use for comparisons the results of nason , dawson and ellis , and refer to them as nde . in this perturbative approach ,",
    "as stated earlier , terms of the kind @xmath31 will appear .",
    "they are remnant of the collinear singularity screened by the finite quark mass . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite they can grow quite large at high tranverse momenta , thereby spoiling the validity of the expansion in @xmath32 . therefore they have to be summed to all orders .    the alternative way is to consider that when a quark , of whichever flavour , is produced at very high transverse momentum @xmath7 its mass plays almost no role at all in the scattering process .",
    "this is to say that mass effects in the kernel cross section are suppressed as power ratios of mass over the scale of the process .",
    "we can therefore devise a picture in which all quarks are produced in a massless fashion at the high scale @xmath33 and only successively , as their virtuality decreases , they can _ fragment _ into a massive heavy quark .",
    "the cross section can therefore be described by a formula analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fact ] ) , with @xmath34 .",
    "the key difference to the hadron production case considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fact ] ) is that initial state conditions for the heavy quark fragmentation functions are now calculable from first principles in qcd ( hence the definition of `` perturbative '' fragmentation functions , pff ) and do not have to be taken from experiment .",
    "actually , the following set of next - to - leading initial state conditions can be obtained  @xcite in the @xmath35 scheme for the fragmentation function of a heavy quark , gluon and light quark respectively , in the heavy quark @xmath14 & & d_q^q(x,_0 ) = ( 1-x ) + ( _ 0 ) c_f_+ [ dqq ] + & & d_g^q(x,_0 ) = ( _ 0 ) t_f(x^2 + ( 1-x)^2 ) [ dgq ] + & & d_q,|q,|q^q(x,_0 ) = 0 [ dqq ] where @xmath36 must be taken of the order of the heavy quark mass .",
    "then using the usual altarelli - parisi evolution equations at nlo accuracy one finds the fragmentation functions set at any desired factorization scale @xmath25",
    ". an important feature of this approach can now be appreciated .",
    "the `` almost - singular '' logarithmic term @xmath37 splits into two , as follows .    a @xmath38 will be found in the kernel cross section @xmath23 which has no dependence on the heavy quark mass , according to the assumption that it is produced in a _ massless _ way .",
    "moreover , by choosing @xmath39 it will not contain large logarithms and its perturbative expansion will behave correctly .",
    "the remaining part of the log will instead be lurked into the fragmentation function @xmath40 .",
    "the large @xmath41 is resummed to all orders by the evolution equations , and only the small @xmath42 provided by the initial state condition is treated at fixed order in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore one expects a better control of the theoretical uncertainty at large @xmath0 . on the other hand , for @xmath43 the fragmentation approach does not allow to recover easily the perturbative result , which , of course , holds exactly .",
    "in order to implement the `` perturbative fragmentation function ( pff ) approach '' at a numerical level we need four ingredients , which are all available at the next - to - leading level :    * the distribution functions of any parton ( including the heavy flavour in question ) in the hadrons ( proton or antiproton ) , evolved at nlo accuracy .",
    "all modern sets satisfy this requirement .",
    "an important point must however be made clear .",
    "a heavy quark present in the initial state can be directly brought to the final state where it is fragmented to the detected heavy flavour through the @xmath44 , and therefore with high probability ( see below ) .",
    "this means that the resulting cross section is particularly sensitive to the overall heavy flavour content of the colliding hadrons . in the parton distribution functions ( pdf )",
    "sets available this content is generated through perturbative gluon splitting above a given threshold .",
    "the total yield will therefore depend on the choice made .",
    "for instance , the hmrs set  @xcite takes @xmath45 as initial condition , whereas the mt  @xcite and the cteq  @xcite ones choose , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting different bottom distributions are plotted in figure  [ bpdf ] : the mt and cteq bottom contents are consistently higher than the hmrs one , the discrepancy growing larger as the hmrs threshold value is approached .",
    "* the kernel cross section for the scattering of any two massless partons into another massless parton .",
    "this calculation is provided at the nlo in various renormalization / factorization schemes in ref .",
    "the massless limit approximation used in these @xmath4 kernel cross sections will not allow to evaluate the heavy quark cross section for @xmath20 . *",
    "the next - to - leading expression for the strong running coupling : @xmath47 \\nonumber\\\\ \\vbox{\\vspace{.4 cm } } & & b = \\frac{33 - 2n_f}{12 \\pi } , \\ ; \\ ; b'= \\frac{153 -19 n_f}{24 \\pi^2}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the qcd scale @xmath27 is set at the value fixed by the structure function set used and the number of active flavours @xmath48 is set at 5 above the appropriate threshold . *",
    "the fragmentation functions of any parton into the heavy flavour .",
    "they are obtained by evolving the initial conditions given above ( eqs .",
    "[ dqq],[dgq],[dqq ] ) with nlo accuracy  @xcite .",
    "this is done through numerical inversion of the mellin moments of the evolved distributions , and a typical result for bottom fragmentation is depicted in figure  [ bfrag ] , together with the uncertainty given by the choice of the initial condition scale @xmath36 around @xmath49 .",
    "the implication of these ideas to lep hadronic data is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with these four ingredients at our disposal we can now evaluate the cross section for the high @xmath0 inclusive hadroproduction of a bottom quark .",
    "this will be done by performing numerically the triple integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fact ] ) .",
    "it must be noted that this integration is not as straightforward as the one usually performed when calculating hadron distributions .",
    "indeed while the hadronic fragmentation functions fall smoothly to zero as @xmath50 approaches one , now the @xmath44 is instead singular in the @xmath51 limit , due to unresummed sudakov terms .",
    "this makes the most usual integration routines to fail in calculating both the integral and the associated numerical error , the latter being heavily underestimated .",
    "more in detail this problem has been overcome by suitably rearranging the integration in such a way that the numerical integration could be reliably performed . by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ eq : fact ] ) in a more compact form , and dropping all unnecessary symbols , we have & = & ^1_x_3^minx_3x_1 x_2 _ ijk f_i f_j _",

    "@xcite with our calculations for two different pdf sets , at the fermilab energy of 1800 gev , for @xmath55 .",
    "we can see that in the high @xmath0 region the perturbative cross section is quite sensitive to the structure function set choice , the mt one giving a markedly lower result .",
    "the opposite happens in the pff approach , which becomes very sensitive in the low @xmath0 region which , as stated above , is plagued by the neglect of the heavy quark mass terms in the partonic cross sections .",
    "this pattern is due to the fact that the nde calculation only uses the light quark content from the structure functions , since the heavy one is produced at the purely perturbative level .",
    "this introduces a mismatch ( albeit of higher order ) as the evolution had been performed by taking into account all flavours , which get mixed through gluon exchange .",
    "our calculation , on the other hand , treats all quarks on the same ground and uses the full information of the pdf set .",
    "this leads to substantially identical predictions obtained in the high @xmath0 region with the two pdf sets . on the contrary , at low @xmath0",
    "the different threashold behaviour of the two sets in the heavy quark content is responsible for the discrepancy between the two results .",
    "figure  [ 630]a , b show the same kind of comparison at 630 gev and 16 tev .",
    "the behaviour is practically identical , once a rescaling on the @xmath0 axis has been considered to account for the different cm energies .",
    "one further comparison can also be made between the mt - b2 and the cteq1 m sets , which have a similar threshold behaviour for the heavy quark flavour .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ 1800cteq]a , b the theoretical uncertainty due to the structure functions set choice is once again smaller in the fragmentation function approach .",
    "next we consider the dependence on the choice of the renormalization / factorization mass scale @xmath56 .",
    "figure  [ 1800sc_mt]a(b ) shows , at 1800 gev and with the mt - b2 ( hmrs - b ) set , the theoretical uncertainty resulting from the variation of the factorization and renormalization mass scales between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is defined as @xmath60 and we have taken @xmath61 . as expected the band of the perturbative nde calculation is sensibly larger than ours , showing the improvement brought by the resummation of the large logarithms of @xmath62 .",
    "the drop at low @xmath0 in the prediction of the hmrs - b set with @xmath63 , which considerably broadens our band in that region , is due to the very poor heavy quark content of this set at such a low scale ( see fig .",
    "[ bpdf ] ) .",
    "all these features can be better appreciated in figure  [ scale ] , where the cross section at 1800 gev with the mt - b2 set is plotted , at fixed @xmath64 and @xmath0 , as a function of @xmath65 , for @xmath66 varying between 0.25 and 4 .",
    "this figure also shows a comparison with the factorized calculation with a born ( i.e. lo ) cross section kernel ( but with two - loop @xmath32 and nlo structure and fragmentation functions ) .",
    "as expected , the lack of the next - to - leading terms strongly enhances the scale dependence .",
    "the similarity between the nde result and the fragmentation function approach with born kernel cross section is striking .",
    "the small scale sensitivity of our full nlo calculation shows that the fragmentation / renormalization scale dependence is a real @xmath67 effect , whereas in the perturbative approach ( e.g. nde ) the presence of large @xmath2 results in an effective @xmath4 dependence .    once again , the results at 630 gev greately mimick those at 1800 gev ( see figure  [ 630sc_mt ] ) .",
    "one further theoretical uncertainty must be considered , namely the one related to the freedom in the choice of the initial condition scale @xmath36 in the fragmentation functions evolution .",
    "figure  [ 1800mu0 ] shows that the cross section is marginally affected by a change of @xmath36 in the range @xmath68 , particularly in the high @xmath0 region .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the pff approach has still a smaller overall theoretical uncertainty also after this qualitatively new feature has been taken into account .",
    "finally , we show in figs .",
    "[ channels]a , b the relative importance of the various partonic subprocesses contributing to the cross section for two sets of pdfs . in the case of the mt - b2 set (",
    "similar results are obtained with the cteq1 m one ) the @xmath69 scattering clearly dominates al low @xmath0 , whereas at large @xmath0 it becomes comparable to other channels . comparing with the hmrs - b set we see that the different threshold behaviour of the heavy quark structure function in this latter set , repetedly pointed out before , is responsible for the lower contribution of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 channels .",
    "we can now turn to quantities of more direct experimental interest and see how the advantages of our approach are reflected onto them .",
    "namely , we will consider the total cross section for one particle inclusive heavy quark production , integrated above a given @xmath71 and within a rapidity region @xmath72 . only the variation of the theoretical prediction due to changes in the factorization / renormalization scale and in the pdf set used will be studied .",
    "other possible sources of uncertainties , aside the change of @xmath36 which has been shown to be almost neglibible , are the value of the qcd scale @xmath27 and of the bottom mass @xmath49 .",
    "they should however be common to both the perturbative and the fragmentation function approach , and have been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figures  [ 1800_hmrs_tot ] , [ 1800_mt_tot ] and [ 1800_cteq_tot ] show the total cross section @xmath73 at a cm energy of 1800 gev .",
    "the hmrs - b , mt - b2 and cteq1 m sets have been used respectively , and the curves obtained with @xmath74 and @xmath63 are plotted .",
    "we can see that the features of the differential cross sections previously discussed translate almost directly into the total cross section .",
    "in particular , the scale dependence of our result is once again remarkably smaller than the one of the perturbative calculation , especially in the high @xmath0 region .",
    "the broadening of the band in the low @xmath0 region than can be observed when the hmrs - b or the cteq1 m set is used with the scale choice @xmath63 is once again due to the different heavy quark content at low scales ( see fig .",
    "[ bpdf ] ) .",
    "the overall smaller theoretical uncertainty of the pff result can finally be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ final ] , where the highest and lowest predictions of the two approaches , out of the six curves previously considered , have been plotted .",
    "note that we have not considered in detail the uncertainties for @xmath75  gev .",
    "the cdf experimental data  @xcite are also shown .",
    "the same kind of result can also be produced at 630 gev .",
    "figure  [ final630 ] compares the band of nde to our one and to experimental data by ua1  @xcite .",
    "also in this case we find a sizeable reduction in the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the production of heavy quarks at large @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) in hadronic collisions , in order to make the theoretical predictions for the differential distributions more reliable .",
    "we have studied this problem in the framework of the perturbative fragmentation functions , which allow a nlo evaluation of the potentially large logarithms of the kind @xmath2 , which are resummed to all orders .",
    "our analysis for the @xmath3-quark leads to much more stable results with respect to changes of the factorization / renormalization scales compared to what is obtained in the @xmath4 perturbative calculation . also the theoretical uncertainty related to different choices of pdf sets is reduced .",
    "other possible sources of uncertainties , like the scale @xmath36 of the initial state condition in the fragmentation functions evolutions , are negligible . a detailed discussion of the differential and integrated cross sections of experimental interest has also been presented",
