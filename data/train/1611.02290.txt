    "reionization of the cosmic gas after it became essentially neutral at a redshift @xmath4 plays a crucial role in the galaxy formation process . unfortunately , the details of the epoch of reionization ( eor ) are to a large extent unknown .",
    "the absence of global absorption shortwards of the rest - frame lyman-@xmath5 ( ) line in the spectra of quasars at @xmath6 made @xcite realize that the hydrogen present in the nearby intergalactic medium ( igm ) was ionized ( @xmath7 ) except for small intervening systems yielding discrete absorption lines , the so - called  forest .",
    "the gunn - peterson trough caused by neutral intergalactic hydrogen was finally found by @xcite and @xcite in the spectra of quasars at @xmath2 , suggesting that value for the redshift @xmath8 of full hydrogen ionization .",
    "several subsequent studies using : ( a ) the mean opacity of the  forest @xcite ; ( b ) the size of the proximity zone around quasars @xcite ; ( c ) the detection of damping wing absorption by neutral igm in quasar spectra @xcite ; ( d ) its non - detection in the spectra of gamma ray bursts @xcite ; ( e ) the abundance of  emitters ( laes ) @xcite ; and ( f ) the covering fraction of dark pixels in the  and ly@xmath9 forests @xcite confirmed a value of @xmath8 of @xmath10 .",
    "such a value is not inconsistent with the detection of laes beyond @xmath11 .",
    "not only is the frequency of  photons shifted in origin due to outflow velocities of the emitting gas clouds , but they are also sufficiently redshifted when leaving the ionized bubbles around galaxies for not being absorbed by the neutral hydrogen present in the igm . in any event ,",
    "the lae abundance rapidly drops beyond @xmath11 @xcite , the most distant spectroscopically confirmed lae lying at @xmath12 ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "this would imply that the volume filling factor of ionized regions , @xmath13 , is decreasing at @xmath14 .",
    "an alternative way to estimate @xmath8 is from the analysis of the large - scale cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . assuming instantaneous reionization",
    ", one can determine @xmath8 and the optical depth to thomson scattering of free electrons by cmb photons , @xmath15 ( hereafter simply the cmb optical depth ) .",
    "the 9-year data gathered from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( wmap9 , @xcite ) led to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the estimates drawn from the temperature three - years _ planck _",
    "data combined with the polarization wmap data were @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite , and the most recent ones inferred taking into account the own _ planck _",
    "data on the large - scale polarization anisotropies have decreased to @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the marked difference between the latter @xmath8 estimates and the previous ones drawn from the spectra of distant luminous sources seems to indicate that reionization , far from being instantaneous , was extended , and possibly non - monotonous @xcite . in this sense , the larger values of @xmath8 inferred assuming instantaneous reionization would just indicate that the ionized fraction was quite low by @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the uncertainty in the associated @xmath15 value is also large .",
    "however , provided the ionized fraction were small enough at @xmath22 , the value of @xmath15 should not be too biased @xcite .",
    "the small - scale cmb anisotropies also inform on the duration @xmath23 of reionization @xcite .",
    "however , its derivation depends on the uncertain correction for dust emission , the dominant signal at the relevant spatial frequencies , and is very sensitive to the assumed morphological model of ionized bubbles .",
    "another integral quantity that constrains the eor , similar to @xmath15 but more sensitive to low redshifts , is the weak comptonization distortion of the cmb radiation spectrum .",
    "although its measured upper limit of @xmath24 @xcite is a rather loose constraint , it has the advantage with respect to @xmath15 of being inferred with no modeling .",
    "but the only way to probe the eor at every @xmath0 is through 21 cm hyperfine line observations ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "unfortunately , the cosmological signal is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than that produced in galaxies , which greatly complicates the technique , and makes it necessary to have a previous good knowledge of the galaxy formation process @xcite .",
    "presently , this approach has only allowed one to put a lower limit to @xmath25 of 0.06 @xcite .    among the various mechanisms that might contribute to reionization ( see e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "the most simple one is photo - ionization by luminous sources , namely active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , normal galaxies with ordinary population ii ( ) stars , and first generation metal - free population iii ( ) stars .",
    "the x - ray background demonstrates that agn emit one order of magnitude less uv photons than needed at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this implies that either massive black holes ( mbhs ) are too scarce @xcite , or their associated agn are too obscured by dust @xcite , while more abundant mini - quasars associated with stellar black holes would have too short duty cycles @xcite .",
    "likewise , the star formation rate densities derived from the rest - frame uv luminosity functions ( lfs ) of normal bright galaxies @xcite show that these objects are insufficient to ionize the igm by @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , ionization would be achieved either as a result of a substantial abundance of faint star - forming galaxies @xcite or of the still undetected first generation stars @xcite .",
    "the situation is even more uncertain regarding reionization .",
    "the mean opacity inferred from the  forest suggests that the redshift of complete reionization , @xmath27 , should be less than or approximately equal to 3 @xcite , and probably no smaller than 2 as the agn emission begins to decline at that redshift @xcite .",
    "agn are indeed the most plausible ionizing sources responsible of reionization as they emit more energetic photons than normal galaxies , and stars , the other sources of energetic photons , do not form at @xmath28 .",
    "it is thus clear that to fully determine the eor we must monitor the formation and evolution of the three kinds of luminous sources and their feedback since the dark ages .",
    "the problem with this approach is that some aspects of the physics involved are poorly known and must be treated through numerous parameters .",
    "this affects not only semi - analytic models ( sams ) but also cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "indeed , simulations accurately deal with dark matter ( dm ) , but most of the baryon physics is at sub - resolution scale .",
    "consequently , they use essentially the same recipes and parameters as sams in this regard .",
    "this problem is particularly hard for simulations because the huge cpu time they involve severely limits the coverage of the whole parameter space .",
    "thus sams are the best option .",
    "the observational data on the universe at high-@xmath0 are rapidly growing , and it might nowadays be possible to address successfully this problem .",
    "that is , it might be possible to adjust all the free parameters of a sam - like model such as the _ analytic model of intergalactic - medium and galaxies _ ( amiga ) , specifically designed by @xcite to deal with the interconnected process of galaxy formation and reionization . in the present paper",
    "we show that , combining the above mentioned information on reionization with the current data on the evolution of the universe at @xmath29 , we can constrain , indeed , the freedom of this model , and have an unprecedented detailed picture of the eor .    the paper is organized as follows . in [ amiga ] we recall the basic characteristics of amiga , paying special attention to its free parameters .",
    "the observational data used to adjust those parameters are given in [ observables ] , and the fitting strategy used is described in [ fitting ] .",
    "our results are presented in [ res ] , and discussed and summarized in [ conclude ] .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume the @xmath30cdm cosmology , with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "amiga is a very complete and detailed , self - consistent model of galaxy formation particularly well - suited to monitor the coupled evolution of luminous sources and igm .",
    "all processes entering the problem are treated as accurately as possible according to our present knowledge . in particular , amiga is the only model of galaxy formation developed so far that includes stars , normal galaxies , and agn , together with an inhomogeneous multiphase igm .",
    "amiga deals with the properties of halos and their baryon content by interpolating them in grids of masses and redshifts that are progressively built , as halos merge and accrete , from trivial boundary conditions .",
    "this procedure is less computer memory - demanding than the usual method based on monte - carlo or @xmath37-body realizations of halo merger trees , and enables us to reach very high redshifts and very low masses while maintaining a good sampling over the entire range in redshift and mass , respectively . in this way we can readily integrate at every @xmath0 the feedback of luminous sources for the halo mass function ( mf ) , and",
    "accurately evolve the igm .",
    "the total number of free parameters in amiga is notably reduced in comparison to ordinary sams thanks to causally linking physical processes that are usually treated as independent from each other .",
    "this greatly diminishes the degrees of freedom and renders the model predictions more reliable .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a full description of amiga . here",
    "we provide a brief overview focusing on the model parameters .",
    "ionizing photons have a very short mean free path in a neutral hydrogenic gas ( hereafter the gas outside halos is referred to as the `` igm '' ) . for this reason ,",
    "luminous sources ionize ( and reheat ) the igm in small bubbles around them , which progressively grow and percolate .",
    "bubbles in turn harbor hotter sub - bubbles due to the most energetic fraction of uv photons emitted .",
    "should the ionizing flux become less intense , the singly or doubly ionized bubbles stop stretching , and the surrounding or regions begin to grow again by recombination ( or new dense or nodes begin to develop after complete reionization ) . in other words ,",
    "the neutral , singly , and doubly ionized igm phases remain well - separated except for small residual fractions .",
    "x - ray photons produced in supernovae ( sne ) and at a lesser extent in stars , ordinary stars in binary systems , and agn have instead a large mean free path , and form a uniform background that reheats the igm by compton scattering .",
    ", when recombination is no more efficient , and the ionized fraction freezes out .",
    "] on the contrary , adiabatic cooling due to cosmic expansion , collisional cooling in hot neutral regions , and compton cooling by cmb photons oppose themselves to the heating .",
    "the latter mechanism is particularly effective at high-@xmath0 where cmb photons are more abundant .",
    "the intergalactic gas falling into halos is shock - heated to their virial temperature .",
    "thus the only halos able to trap gas at any given moment are those with virial temperatures higher than the time - varying temperature of the surrounding igm .",
    "the accretion of gas onto galaxies is calculated in amiga as usual in sams : taking into account the cooling of the hot intrahalo gas and its free - fall to the halo center .",
    "( hereafter the gas trapped within halos is simply referred to as `` the hot gas '' , and the gas inside galaxies as `` the cold gas '' . )",
    "however , such a classical scenario strictly holds only in the case of massive halos where the gas infall rate is limited by the cooling rate . in low - mass halos",
    "it is limited by the rate at which the halo accretes gas from outside .",
    "since such an accretion is calculated in amiga independently of the symmetry of the problem , our treatment thus implicitly deals with accretion of cold gas onto galaxies according to the filament scenario @xcite .",
    "not only do galaxies accrete gas , but they also lose it through sn- and agn - driven winds . thus the hot gas continuously incorporates metals through three channels : i ) via halo mergers , through the gas within the merging halos ; ii ) via accretion , through the gas ( if any ) in small accreted halos and directly in the form of diffuse gas ( inflows ) ; and iii ) via mass losses from the galaxies in the own halo ( outflows ) .",
    "halos themselves may lose the hot gas if it becomes unbound .",
    "amiga accurately takes into account all these mass exchanges between the different gaseous phases within ionized regions .    in neutral regions",
    "igm remains unpolluted except for possible recombination periods after complete reionization .",
    "therefore , stars with metallicity below some threshold value @xmath38 for atomic cooling , in the range between @xmath39 and @xmath40 solar units , can only form through -molecular cooling in such neutral , pristine regions , which are immediately photo - dissociated and photo - ionized around those stars .",
    "the evolving extent of the different igm phases is described by means of the volume filling factors of singly and doubly ionized regions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which result from solving the improved differential equations @xcite q= -q[rec ] where a dot means time - derivative , with trivial initial conditions in the dark ages . in equation ( [ rec ] )",

    "the dramatic growth of mbhs within spheroids , regulated by the amount of gas reaching them , causes mbhs to rapidly lose the memory of their seeds , and the properties mbhs also become independent of @xmath38 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76",

    "some of the observables involving the parameters of the latter set refer to mean mass densities per unit volume , not per unit _",
    "ionized _ volume , or to metallicities averaged over all regions , not over _ ionized _ regions .",
    "consequently , they involve not only the properties of normal galaxies and mbhs , but also the volume filling factor of ionized regions , which depends on the mass fraction , @xmath83 , of massive stars . nonetheless ,",
    "once the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 are fixed , those observables will depend only on the parameters referring to normal galaxies and mbhs .",
    "third , most of the parameters in these two sets can be adjusted sequentially .    for",
    "a given value of @xmath38 , the ionization and photo - heating of the igm at high-@xmath0 depend only on the mass fraction @xmath83 of massive stars , while the mass of metals ejected in ionized regions depends only on the mass fraction @xmath75 .",
    "thus it should be possible to adjust @xmath83 by fitting the igmth at high-@xmath0 , and then adjust @xmath75 by fitting the igmmh also at high-@xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , for a given couple of @xmath111 and @xmath112 values , the amount of gas in the disk or spheroid of a galaxy at any moment is equal to the amount of gas fallen into it , which depends on cosmology ( through the halo characteristics , the hot gas cooling rate , and the galaxy merger rate ) , . ] minus the amount of gas used to form stars and ejected from the component ( the latter depending on the former ) .",
    "the inductive reasoning thus implies that the stellar masses of normal galaxies depend only on @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , the mass of gas fueling the central mbh of a galaxy depends on the gas mass collected in the spheroid , which together with the stellar mass sets the dynamics , and hence , the mass of newly formed stars and of gas heated by sne , the mass of the mbh determining its accretion rate , and the mass of gas heated by the enlightened agn .",
    "therefore , the inductive reasoning implies that the mbhh depends on both @xmath101 and @xmath120 .",
    "lastly , the metallicity of the hot gas in the halo that determines , through the gas cooling and the metal - enriched gas ejected from galaxies , the cold gas and stellar metallicities of those objects depends on cosmology , on @xmath101 , @xmath120 , and on @xmath118 setting the mixing rate of the reheated gas in the halo . finally , the emissivity of galaxies and agn depends on all the previous parameters setting the whole evolution of galaxies and agn and their respective intrinsic ionizing photon production rates and the values of @xmath130 from the two kinds of sources .",
    "consequently , it should be possible to adjust @xmath101 by fitting the sfh ( or sth ) , then @xmath120 by fitting the mbhh , then @xmath118 by fitting the hgmh ( or any of the cgmh and stmh ) , and lastly the @xmath130 values of galaxies and agn by fitting their corresponding iehs with the suited priors on @xmath8 and @xmath185 ( hereafter @xmath186 means @xmath0-derivative ) .",
    "of course , this sequential fitting procedure should be carried out for every possible set of @xmath38 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 values in the corresponding 3-d space .",
    "but this is a minor difficulty compared to directly looking for acceptable solutions in the whole 11-d parameter space .",

    "moreover , since @xmath111 and @xmath112 govern the amount of cold gas remaining in disks and of stars forming in spheroids , the cgh and gamh should hopefully also be fitted . and given the way @xmath97 is determined , the gash should too .",
    "in principle , the solution so obtained should also recover the observed galaxy stellar and mbh mfs and , provided @xmath38 is not degenerate so that there is still one degree of freedom to play with , we may expect the solution to also fulfill the constraints on @xmath15 , and @xmath65 . thus the problem is not only well - posed , but in principle also slightly overdetermined .",
    "unfortunately , the igmmh and igmth at high-@xmath0 are not well - constrained .",
    "the only available data on the igm temperature refer to @xmath190 where stars play no significant role , and there are just a few loose bounds for the igm metallicity .",

    "moreover , @xmath38 is degenerate with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the good news is that this degeneracy reduces the degrees of freedom to 10 , which facilitates the fit at the cost , of course , of making it even harder to find any acceptable solution .    indeed , massive stars are the first source of ionizing photons , with emissivity equal to @xmath191 , where @xmath192 and @xmath193 are the formation rate and  photon production rate of stars , respectively",

    "but this condition is necessary although not sufficient . when normal galaxies form , they keep on ionizing and photo - heating the surrounding igm , while they lose very few metals into it ( they rather enrich the hot intrahalo gas ) .",
    "consequently , the metallicity of ionized bubbles decreases , and their temperature increases , so the formation of new galaxies may be quenched , and reionization may be aborted . only if the initial igm metallicity is _ sufficiently large _ will the formation of normal galaxies last long enough for reionization to proceed successfully .    according to the previous discussion",
    ", the evolution of the universe for some values @xmath38 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 will thus be essentially the same ( with @xmath196 in units of @xmath38 ) as for other values @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 , provided the igm reionization and metal - enrichment histories driven by stars are the same , that is provided the two sets of values satisfy the relations f_2+f_3=f_2+f_3 [ deg1 ] = .",
    "[ deg2 ] this leads to the following simple fitting procedure .",

    "this will allow reionization to recover by @xmath237 .",
    "indeed , the igm metallicity _ in ionized regions _ is initially kept roughly constant due to the fixed proportion of metals ( @xmath238 ) and ionizing photons ( @xmath239 ) provided by stars .",
    "but , once normal galaxies begin to form , there is a larger contribution of ionizing photons than of metals ( remember that metals ejected from galaxies mainly stay within halos ) , so the metallicity of ionized regions begins to decrease .",
    "this does not prevent , of course , the _ total average _ igm metallicity from growing ( fig .",
    "[ double ] , panel ( g ) ) through the increasing weight of ionized regions .",

    "provided the minimum value of @xmath200 is large enough ( the maximum value of @xmath209 low enough ) to warrant that the igm metallicity in ionized regions is still overcritical at @xmath1 , new galaxies will form , indeed , in this model from that redshift to about @xmath241 when the temperature of the ionized igm increases again at a high enough rate for @xmath216 to grow more rapidly than @xmath217 .",

    "the minimum mass of trapping halos in model d during that period is the largest ever been , and the metallicity of the initial hot gas is the lowest , so the cooling rate reaches very low values . as a consequence , a large fraction of these second generation normal galaxies have very small stellar masses , similar to those of the above mentioned failed galaxies .    since @xmath1 in model",
    "s or since @xmath241 in model d , no new galaxies form .",
    "galaxies just grow at the center of halos through the accretion of new cooled gas and satellite captures",

    "consequently , at any @xmath0 lower than 7 , there are in both models galaxies with the whole spectrum of stellar masses .",
    "the only difference is that , while in model s all the very low mass satellites are failed galaxies , in model d many of them are second generation galaxies formed at @xmath243 .",
    "notice that , even though halos where those two kinds of galaxies form have similar masses , @xmath217 is much greater at @xmath240 than at the formation of failed galaxies , so those second generation low - mass galaxies are more abundant than failed ones .",
    "figure [ gal_mfs ] shows the galaxy stellar mfs that result in models s and d at redshifts @xmath179 and @xmath180 . to compare them with the empirical mfs inferred by @xcite at the same redshifts",
    "we need to account for the above mentioned inconsistency between the sfh and sth datasets .",
    "indeed , at high- and low-@xmath0 , the predicted sth curve , consistent with the empirical sfh one , is close to the upper envelope of the stellar mass density estimates , and between @xmath190 and @xmath244 it is even higher ( see fig .",
    "[ compbdbh ] ) . @xcite put forward that such an inconsistency could be due to a @xmath0-varying imf",
    ". however , the largest discrepancy is found at an intermediate redshift range , which would require the imf to have a strange non - monotonous trend .",
    "a simpler explanation is that the correction for dust attenuation achieved in the galaxy uv luminosities is typically underestimated .",
    "galaxies in the redshift range @xmath245 would be substantially brighter than believed , the effect being less marked at higher and lower redshifts because of the lower metallicity of galaxies and the more accurate correction achieved , respectively .",
    "but , whatever the real cause of that inconsistency is , provided all the observed galaxies are similarly affected , the _ shape _ of the mfs derived from the uv lfs would be right except for an horizontal shift . specifically , according to the stellar mass density estimated inferred by @xcite at redshifts 3.8 and 6.8 and the theoretical sth curve consistent with the empirical sfh one , the mfs used by @xcite to infer those estimates should be shifted in model d ( s ) by a factor of about 6.0 ( 7.9 ) and 1.3 ( 0.8 ) , respectively . taking into account that the extrapolations of those empirical mfs were underestimated by factors @xmath246 ( 1.3 ) and @xmath247 ( 1.4 ) , respectively ,",
    "the actual shifts to be applied at those redshifts are 9.5 ( 10.3 ) and 2.7 ( 1.2 ) , respectively . as it can be seen in figure [ compbdbh ] , these shifts make the empirical mfs fully match indeed the predicted ones except for the incomplete low - mass bins ( see below ) .",
    "thus the predicted galaxy stellar mfs are in very good agreement with the observations .",
    "the fact that the mf predicted at @xmath179 also matches the schechter fit to the original ( with no shift ) galaxy stellar mf recently derived by @xcite at @xmath248 assuming a constant imf also gives strong support to the interpretation that the inconsistency between the sfh and sth datasets is due to a deficient correction for dust attenuation . according to our results in model d ( s ) , the uv luminosities of galaxies inferred by @xcite at @xmath179 and @xmath180",
    "would be underestimated by 2.5 ( 2.7 ) mag and 1.0 ( 1.1 ) mag , respectively .",
    "regarding the behavior at lower - masses of the predicted mfs , we find the turnover at @xmath249 dex from the knee in model s , and at @xmath250 dex in model d. these results are consistent with the latest uv lfs of galaxies observed at @xmath251 @xcite , which find that the turnover is not yet detected at @xmath252 mag ( or @xmath253 dex in mass ) from the knee .",
    "we remark that all previous models of galaxy formation predicted the turnover at just @xmath249 mag ( @xmath254 dex in mass ) from the knee @xcite , which is contradicted by these observations . in this sense ,",
    "our model is the first to predict mfs consistent with the observations . according to it ,",
    "such lfs should still go @xmath255 mag or @xmath256 mag deeper in models s or d , respectively , for the turnover to be finally detected .",
    "model d also predicts the existence of a second bump at very low masses in the galaxy stellar mfs at @xmath179 caused by the second generation low - mass galaxies that become satellites soon after their formation .",
    "this bump is far from the current observational limits of the galaxy stellar mfs at those redshifts .",
    "however , given the small mass of those satellites , a large fraction of them should still survive at @xmath257 . in model",
    "s , there is no such a bump , although the abundance of very low mass galaxies is also quite high .",
    "thus a prediction of our model , regardless of the version , is that it should be possible to detect at @xmath257 very old satellites with masses between @xmath235  and @xmath258 .",
    "we describe next the expected metallicity , morphology , and size of those predicted relics .",
    "the hot gas metallicity increases in parallel to the cold gas and stellar metallicities ( see fig .",
    "[ double ] , panel ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "the only effect that partly balances that increase is the accretion by halos of low - metallicity igm in ionized regions .",
    "that increase is more marked in model s than in model d due to the steeper sfh caused by the larger @xmath101 value , and hence , the larger amount of stars that are permanently forming in galaxies .",
    "another more subtle difference between the two models is the small dip in the hot gas metallicity in model d after @xmath1 due to the large amount of fresh gas that is being incorporated by halos during recombination owing to the dip in the temperature of the ionized igm .",
    "this translates , of course , in less marked dips in the cgmh and stmh of model d. the stellar and cold gas metallicities of the second generation galaxies formed in this model during recombination , similar to those of the primordial failed galaxies formed in both models , are of about 10@xmath38 , i.e. significantly lower than average . on the contrary ,",
    "the metallicities of galaxies more massive than @xmath259  are , of course , larger than average ( see also fig .",
    "[ double ] , panels ( e ) and ( f ) ) and show a well - understood behavior with @xmath0 : at the highest redshift where those galactic masses are assembled , such galaxies are extraordinarily massive , having been formed in the merger of evolved high metallicity galaxies ; then the metallicities slowly decrease as the masses become increasingly ordinary and such galaxies form through other channels ( including accretion of hot gas with lower metallicity ) ; and , when the masses of the galaxies approach the average galaxy mass at @xmath244 , they begin to increase just as the average metallicities do since @xmath2 .",
    "the morphology of galaxies follows from the following general trends .",
    "when a galaxy forms , the gas it collects comes from the very central part of the halo , so it has little angular momentum , and it is pilled up in a spheroid .",
    "consequently , the failed galaxies in models s and d as well as the second generation low - mass galaxies in model d are spheroids .",
    "but , soon after their formation , the morphology of galaxies evolves at the center of halos . at",
    "very high-@xmath0 , when cooling is very efficient , galaxies usually collect large amounts of cold gas that render disks unstable .",
    "in addition , halos are small , and galaxy mergers frequent , so , whenever disks are stable , they are short - lived and never reach large radii .",
    "but , as halos grow , cooling becomes less efficient and galaxy mergers less frequent , so disks grow larger and are more long - lived . as a consequence ,",
    "the fraction of spheroid - dominated galaxies slowly decreases with decreasing @xmath0 . on the other hand , at any given @xmath0 , the most massive galaxies tend to be spheroids arising from galaxy mergers of massive objects , while disks preferentially lie in intermediate mass galaxies .",
    "these trends explain the observed fraction of spheroid - dominated objects with masses above @xmath172  at @xmath260 .",
    "we remark , however , that about @xmath261% of galaxies at those redshifts are red dead ellipticals with no star formation .",
    "these galaxies have been excluded from the results shown in panel ( h ) of figure [ double ] , as they would go undetected .",
    "therefore , the real fraction of spheroid - dominated massive galaxies at those redshifts is @xmath262 rather than @xmath263 .",
    "the size of galaxies increases in parallel to their mass since the beginning .",
    "in fact , when they form as spheroids from a gas cloud with small angular momentum , even though the metallicity of the gas is low ( about @xmath38 ) , they undergo a large dissipative contraction until they reach the density of molecular clouds .",
    "this leads to stellar systems with the typical density of globular clusters .",
    "the size of more evolved spheroids depends on the amount and metallicity of the gas they collect ( see eq .  [ [ radius2 ] ] ) .",
    "the result is an evolution of the average equivalent radius ( measured as the square root of the mass - weighted squared equivalent radii of the bulge and the disk , if any ) of spheroid - dominated galaxies with masses above @xmath264  that recovers the observations at @xmath260 ( fig .",
    "[ double ] , panel ( i ) ) .",
    "specifically , when those very massive galaxies appear for the first time in dry mergers of massive spheroids , their equivalent radius is even slightly larger than that of present day slightly contracted spheroids of the same mass ; this radius begins to decrease as the mass becomes increasingly ordinary and those galaxies form from unstable disks and wet mergers ; it then increases again up to a secondary maximum caused by the increasing lack of gas followed by the increase of the gas metallicity at @xmath265 ( see fig .",
    "[ double ] , panel ( e ) ) ; and it finally increases until @xmath257 due to the definite small amount of gas present in galaxies .",
    "thus the properties of very low mass galaxies are essentially the same in both models .",
    "they are among the first objects with stars to form ; they are spheroids with no gas ; they are very compact , with the typical density of globular clusters ; and their stars have very low metallicities ( of about 10100 times @xmath38 , with @xmath38 equal to @xmath266 z@xmath170 in model s , and @xmath267 z@xmath170 in model d ) . on the other hand , those of them that froze out as satellites soon after formation have very large baryon - to - dm mass ratios as their original dm halos are truncated by the potential well of the also quite dense capturing halo near the region where all the stars are strongly concentrated . and , the fraction of those satellites that will be captured long time after ( because of the slight dynamic friction they suffer ) by evolved , much less dense galaxies will survive inside them as small independent dynamical entities .    clearly",
    ", all these properties greatly resemble those of present day globular clusters . since such objects are often seen to freely orbit within halos , they should have formed outside galaxies and have a cosmological origin similar to them .",
    "it is thus not surprising that a self - consistent model such as amiga that monitors the formation and evolution of luminous objects since the dark ages does not miss them .",
    "notice that , if this is indeed the origin of globular clusters , the larger abundance of such objects compared to massive galaxies is more consistent with model d than with model s.    let us now turn to the mfs of mbhs .",
    "mbhs grow since the remnant mini - mbhs of star clusters begin to develop at the center of galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ double ] , panel ( c ) ) .",
    "there , they merge with the mbhs brought by accreted or merged galaxies having reached the center of the galaxy by dynamical friction , and accrete new material . indeed , when some amount of gas reaches the spheroid it fuels the mbh .",
    "the associated agn is then lit , and begins to reheat the circumnuclear gas , quenching the star formation that is going on in the spheroid .",
    "the more massive the mbh , the larger both the agn bolometric luminosity and the fraction of gas reheated and expelled from the spheroid back into the halo .",
    "this leads to a self - regulated growth of mbhs and stellar spheroids , which tends to a constant mbh - to - spheroid mass ratio as observed ( fig .",
    "[ bhdas ] ) .",
    "this thus gives strong support to the mechanism proposed by @xcite included in amiga for the coupled growth of mbhs and spheroids .",
    "the parallel evolution of spheroids and mbhs goes together with that of disks .",
    "of course , when gas replenishment begins to decline by @xmath241 ( see section 5.4 ) , the disk and spheroid mass density histories become slightly shallower .",
    "( the change of slope is a little less marked in spheroids than in disks due to their unchanged behavior in major mergers . ) but this has a minor effect in the parallel evolution of the spheroid and mbh stellar mass densities because mergers become at the same time increasingly dry .",
    "indeed , in dry mergers spheroids grow through the addition of stars belonging to the merging galaxies , while mbhs grow by coalescence of the respective mbhs and , since the mbh - to - spheroid mass ratio is the same in all the progenitors , it remains unchanged in the final object . as a consequence ,",
    "the mbh and spheroid mass ratio will be kept essentially unaltered until @xmath257 .",
    "figure [ mbh_mfs ] shows the mbh mfs predicted at redshifts @xmath181 and @xmath268 .",
    "like in the case of the galaxy stellar mfs , to compare these mfs to the empirical ones derived at the same redshifts by @xcite and @xcite we must take into account any effect that could affect the latter .",
    "as mentioned , the observed agn lfs are greatly affected by incompleteness , obscuration , and inactivity , which cause the mbh mass density estimates derived from them to be much lower than expected from the observed constant mbh - to - spheroid mass ratio .",
    "incompleteness affects in an uneven way the different mass bins of the mbh mfs , but their large mass end should be complete .",
    "obscuration is also larger for low - mass objects @xcite , but the most massive bins should be similarly affected .",
    "thus a vertical shift by a factor @xmath269 of a few hundreds should be enough to correct the empirical mbh mfs for obscuration and inactivity .",
    "in addition , there is the uncertainty in the mbh mass estimates themselves coming from the poorly determined virial factor , @xmath153 or @xmath154 .",
    "for instance , the mbh masses derived by @xcite and @xcite at @xmath156 and @xmath270 , respectively , from emission - line reverberation assume @xmath271 @xcite , while , according to @xcite , this factor could be up to a factor 5 smaller .",
    "consequently , the empirical mbh mfs derived by those authors might also need to be shifted horizontally towards large masses by a factor @xmath272 in the range @xmath273 .",
    "the value of @xmath272 is unknown , but it should be independent of @xmath0 . on the other hand , the shifts @xmath274 these effects would cause to the mbh mass density estimates derived by @xcite and @xcite should make them match the predicted mbhh curve consistent with the observed mbh - to - spheroid mass ratio , equal to @xmath275 and @xmath276 at @xmath181 and @xmath156 , respectively ( see fig .  [ bhdas ] ) . taking into account the different degrees of completion in the extrapolated mfs used in the calculation of those mbh mass density estimates , the vertical shifts to be applied to the corresponding mfs at @xmath181 and @xmath156 should be 1.58 and 1.70 times larger , respectively . therefore , with the only freedom of the @xmath0-independent value of @xmath272 ( with @xmath277 ) , it should be possible to shift the empirical mfs at the two redshifts so as to match those predicted at the two redshifts . as shown in figure [ mbh_mfs ] , this is indeed what we find for @xmath278 ( or @xmath279 ) .",
    "notice that , as a consequence of the small correction in @xmath154 , the upper mass limit of mbhs at @xmath181 becomes @xmath280 , which is more reasonable than the original value of @xmath281  if we compare with such an upper limit at @xmath257 .",
    "it might be argued that the model could be wrong and the solutions found for some appropriate values of the free parameters still recover the observed global and differential cosmic properties at @xmath151 .",
    "but such good results have been achieved with _ less than one degree of freedom per curve _ , which is unbelievable for any model that would not include the right physics . to see this we must simply think , for instance , in the fitting by means of a well - suited function with no physics of _ one single monotonous curve _ such as the observed sfh at @xmath151 that requires four parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , not only does our model with only 9 degrees of freedom provide very good fits to the dozen observed curves at @xmath151 ( plus the galaxy stellar and mbh mfs ) , but it also automatically recovers all their extreme and saddle points at @xmath282 with no need to change the value of any parameter .",
    "as mentioned , disks become increasingly abundant as @xmath0 decreases , so the cold gas mass density increases ( fig .  [ double ] , panel ( a ) ) . but",
    "cooling becomes increasingly inefficient , and by @xmath241 the rate of gas storage in disks begins to decline and the cgh becomes increasingly shallower .",
    "this effect is particularly marked in model d , where the cgh reaches a plateau between @xmath265 to @xmath251 .",
    "the observed cgh is also flat at those redshifts , but the plateau reaches @xmath282 ( see fig .  [ double ] , panel ( b ) ) .",
    "there are several possible causes for that small discrepancy , such as the fact that the empirical cold gas mass density estimates do not include molecular gas or that observations may be biased towards large ( massive ) dlas which have the lowest gas content .",
    "but the most likely reason is that satellite interactions , neglected in the present work , begin to have a significant impact in the amount of gas present in disks . in any event",
    ", the predicted stagnation of cold gas around @xmath244 corresponds to a saddle point , not to a maximum , in agreement with observation ( e.g. @xcite ) . at lower redshifts the temperature of the singly and doubly ionized",
    "igm begins to diminish ( see fig  [ double ] , panel ( l ) ) , causing a rather constant slope in the hgmh , and the continuation of cooling .",
    "of course , the sfr density of ordinary ( ) stars increases in parallel to the cold gas mass density ( see fig .  [ compbdbh ] ) , so , when gas replenishment begins to decline by @xmath283 , the sfr density also slows down . until that redshift ,",
    "spheroids were much more abundant than disks , which never collected large amounts of gas .",
    "nonetheless , disks were small , so their dynamical time was short , and the sfr density in disks was notable ( see fig .",
    "[ new ] ) .",
    "the small amount of gas in disks also prevents the sfr density in mergers from being too large .",
    "it is just comparable to that in unstable disks at high-@xmath0 , and reaches a maximum at @xmath2 .",
    "this does not mean that mergers are less frequent from that moment ; they just become increasingly dry . as the cooling rate declines ,",
    "the sfr in _ individual _ unstable disks also does , but the corresponding _ global _ sfr density keeps on increasing because of the increasing abundance of spheroids contributing to it .",
    "the same happens with disks : even though the size of disks increases and the amount of cold gas they harbor decreases with decreasing @xmath0 so that the sfr in individual disks decreases , the global sfr density in disks keeps on increasing because of the increasing abundance of disks . as a result ,",
    "the ratio between the sfr densities in disks and spheroids is kept roughly constant .",
    "however , the declining amount of cold gas in disks ultimately causes the sfr in both unstable and stable disks to reach a maximum at @xmath282 , and then to rapidly diminish towards @xmath257 ( see fig .",
    "therefore , the origin of this maximum in the sfh is the same as for the plateau in the cgh : the lack of gas replenishment .",
    "however , in the sfh case , such a stagnation leads to a real maximum , not to a saddle point like in the cgh case .",
    "the drop in the sfr in disks and spheroids at @xmath282 is so marked that , even though at lower redshifts the cold gas mass density begins to increase again , the total sfr density will keep on decreasing until @xmath257 .",
    "the stagnation of cold gas mass at @xmath284 has a similar effect on the sfh in models s and d. but the rest of the curve is slightly different in the two models . in model d , the sfh grows more steeply at high-@xmath0 despite the smaller value of @xmath101 ( see fig .  [ double ] , panel ( j ) ) because of the more rapid growth of ionized regions where normal galaxies lie .",
    "but , near @xmath285 the formation of stars declines and ionized regions stop growing , causing the sfh to become shallower .",
    "this yields a concave curvature in the sfh of model d that perfectly fits the data . instead , the sfh in model s has a more constant slope .",
    "this difference in the sfh of both models combined with the large abundance of spheroids with a very efficient sn heating also translates into a larger amount of hot gas in model d between @xmath286 to @xmath265 ( see fig .",
    "[ double ] , panel ( x ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no observational data on this quantity yet , so the behavior of the hgmh in the two models can not be checked .",
    "the behavior of the ieh from galaxies and agn follows from the evolution of those two kinds of sources described above . at",
    "very high-@xmath0 , stars have the dominant contribution . but",
    "this contribution diminishes as neutral pristine regions progressively disappear . in model",
    "d it completely vanishes at @xmath1 when stars stop forming , whereas in model s it continues until @xmath287 . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum contribution from agn is one order of magnitude smaller at @xmath282 .",
    "consequently , the -ionizing emissivity at @xmath190 is always dominated by normal galaxies , and its evolution closely follows the sfh associated with ordinary stars . in particular , the ieh also reaches a maximum at @xmath282 ( see fig .",
    "[ renew ] ) .",
    "what is less obvious is the maximum in both models s and d of the - and -ionizing ( as well as the x - ray ) emissivities from agn at that redshift ( fig .  [ renew ] ) : the mbh mass density is ever increasing at @xmath288 ( see fig .  [ bhdas ] ) so we could naively expect their emissivities to also do .",
    "what causes these maxima is the fact that the most massive mbhs stop being fueled by that redshift ( their galaxies undergo dry mergers ) .",
    "consequently , the bright agn stop radiating as quasars , and remain in the more quiescent radio phase .",
    "this has a major impact in the global agn emissivities because bright agn have the largest bolometric luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , massive mbhs keep on growing through dry mergers and less massive ones through wet mergers of low - mass galaxies that still harbor gas .",
    "observational data on the high-@xmath0 universe are nowadays numerous and accurate enough to severely constrain the interconnected evolution of galaxies and igm . in fact , they would completely determine it provided the igm metallicity and temperature were known at @xmath289 .",
    "these pieces of information are needed , indeed , to determine the threshold metallicity @xmath38 for atomic cooling and the star imf that play a crucial role in the reionization process . assuming that imf a power - law",
    ", the conditions that the metallicity of ionized regions must be high enough for triggering sustained galaxy formation and stars massive enough for seeding mbhs , greatly constrain those two properties .",
    "the only acceptable solutions we find are in two narrow sets , one for small @xmath208 values ( moderately top - heavy star imfs ) leading to single reionization , and another one for large @xmath208 values ( top - heavier star imfs ) leading to double reionization .",
    "the latter solutions have a first ionization phase driven by population iii stars completed at @xmath1 , and after a short recombination period a second ionization phase driven by normal galaxies completed at @xmath2 . in the former solutions with single reionization ,",
    "both kinds of luminous sources contribute in parallel to the ionization of the igm , completed at @xmath2 .",
    "the best solution with double reionization gives excellent fits to all the observables .",
    "instead , the best solution with single reionization predicts a too monotonous sfh , and a slightly too steep cgh at @xmath290 .",
    "however , the cmb thomson optical depth found in double reionization ( @xmath291 ) , though consistent with the observational estimates from the _ wmap _ 9-year and _ planck _ three - year data , is @xmath292 larger than the most recent estimate ( @xmath293 ) from the planck data taking into account the large - scale polarization anisotropies . instead , the cmb optical depth found in single reionization ( @xmath294 ) is consistent with that estimate .",
    "there is thus some tension between the new estimate of @xmath15 and the observed properties of the universe at high-@xmath0 .",
    "however , the empirical values of the cmb optical depth derived under the instantaneous reionization approximation must be taken with caution .    the fact that with only 9 degrees of freedom it is possible to fit a dozen of independent cosmic histories with non - trivial features ( extreme and saddle points ) confers strong reliability to our self - consistent model of the eor .    as a byproduct",
    ", we have clarified the origin of some interesting features shown by the data on the high-@xmath0 universe : 1 ) the very small sizes of spheroids at @xmath260 ; 2 ) the sudden drop of the sfh at @xmath295 ; 3 ) the similar behavior of the uv ( and x - ray ) emissivity from agn at the same redshift ; 4 ) the plateau in the cgh between at @xmath296 ; and 5 ) the rough constancy of the mbh - to - spheroid mass ratio .",
    "our results also suggest that globular clusters are but the relics of the lowest mass galaxies with primordial origin or , more probably , formed during recombination in model d , which soon become frozen as satellite galaxies .",
    "finally , we have provided several predictions that should allow one to confirm the validity of the present model , and tell between single and double reionization .",

    "<S> we combine observational data on a dozen independent cosmic properties at high-@xmath0 with the information on reionization drawn from the spectra of distant luminous sources and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) to constrain the interconnected evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium since the dark ages . </S>",
    "<S> the only acceptable solutions are concentrated in two narrow sets . in one of them </S>",
    "<S> reionization proceeds in two phases : a first one driven by population iii stars , completed at @xmath1 , and after a short recombination period a second one driven by normal galaxies , completed at @xmath2 . in the other set </S>",
    "<S> both kinds of sources work in parallel until full reionization at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the best solution with double reionization gives excellent fits to all the observed cosmic histories , but the cmb optical depth is 3-@xmath3 larger than the recent estimate from the planck data . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the best solution with single reionization gives less good fits to the observed star formation rate density and cold gas mass density histories , but the cmb optical depth is consistent with that estimate . </S>",
    "<S> we make several predictions , testable with future observations , that should discriminate between the two reionization scenarios . as a byproduct our models provide a natural explanation to some characteristic features of the cosmic properties at high-@xmath0 , as well as to the origin of globular clusters . </S>"
