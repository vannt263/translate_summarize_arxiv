    "the plasma membrane and the membrane of cell compartments such as the er and the golgi continually produce vesicles for cargo transport .",

    "the coats are classified in three major classes , copii , copi and clathrin .",

    "more precisely , the assembly and disassembly of cop coat components follow the cycle of activation - inactivation of a gtpase protein , sar1 for copii and arf1 for copi @xcite . once activated , the gtpases bind to the membrane and recruit individual coatomer complexes ( the monomers ) , that later polymerize into coats @xcite .",
    "the inactivation of the gtpase , triggered by the hydrolysis of its bound gtp , leads to its unbinding from the membrane and to the monomer disassembly if the gtpase belongs to a monomer .",
    "strikingly , frap experiments suggest that the exchange kinetics of coat components is much faster than the rate of vesicle secretion @xcite . in other words , many futile monomers are released to the cytosol during the expansion of a coat .",

    "the secretory membrane thus constitutes a bistable dynamical system able to abruptly switch vesicle secretion on and off at prescribed monomer turnover rates .    since all membrane - bound monomers are inactivated with the same rate @xmath4 , the total flux of monomer leaving the membrane after inactivation @xmath90 is directly proportional to the total amount of monomer on the membrane .",

    "the rate of vesicle formation increases with @xmath32 , so the total amount of membrane - bound material actually _ decreases _ with increasing concentration of free monomer .",

    "this situation can not be maintained at steady state , and spontaneously evolves toward either state * b * or * d*.    * steady vesicle secretion regime d*. if the monomer concentration on the membrane is large , the effective coat energy exhibits a nucleation barrier but no intermediate minimum ( fig.2*d * ) .",

    "the growth of coated pits and the secretion of coated vesicles result from a kinetic balance between the polymerization and the inactivation of coat components .",
    "it is thus to be expected that coat maturation can only proceed if the coatomers turnover at the membrane is sufficiently slow @xcite .",
    "our model goes beyond this intuitive analysis , and shows that secretory membranes are able to abruptly switch between a quiescent and a vesicle producing state upon a slowing down of coatomer recycling .",
    "switch - like behaviors are clearly advantageous for biological systems .",
    "the highly non - linear nature of a switch confers evident robustness with respect to the noisy environment , and allows for a precise regulation of the system s activity .",
    "the biological consequences of the `` secretory switch '' are discussed below , together with the influence of important factors , such as the density of cargo or the membrane tension , in regulating the activity of secretory membranes .",
    "we also show how some apparently unrelated observations on cops vesicles naturally fit into our global picture of coated vesicle secretion .",
    "+      consider a secretory membrane receiving a fixed amount of coatomer per unit time .",
    "as coatomers accumulate and aggregate , the membrane eventually reaches a steady state in which the flux of coatomer leaving the membrane ( by inactivation or vesicle secretion ) balances the in - flux .",
    "if the in - flux is low , the membrane is covered by monomers and stationary coated pits , the latter being prevented to mature into fully - formed coated vesicles by the combined effect of coatomer recycling and the energy associated to membrane deformation . as the in - flux increases ,",
    "the coated pits to monomer ratio increases ( fig.2*a * , dashed blue line ) , but as long as the membrane remains in the  stationary pits \" regime ( * b * - fig.3 ) the size and shape of the coated pits is weakly sensitive to the in - flux and no vesicle is produced .",
    "however , beyond a threshold value of the in - flux , state * b * disappears ( fig.3 ) .",
    "coated pits are not kinetically stable , and after a fast transient regime that sees the release of the previously stable coated pits , the membrane settles into a state of steady vesicle secretion ( state * d * ) .",
    "if the in - flux is now reduced , the membrane _ remains _ in the secretory state * d * , which possesses a stable branch for smaller in - flux ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the secretory regime disappears below yet another critical threshold and the systems jumps back into the quiescent state * b*.    the coat population can thus undergo discontinuous dynamical transitions , characterized by an hysteretic cycle , between the two non - equilibrium steady states * b * and * d*. in other words , the secretory membrane works in an all - or - nothing fashion and can switch vesicle production on and off within a narrow range of control parameters such as the gtpase activation and inactivation rates , and membrane tension .",
    "fig.4 shows the rate of vesicle secretion as a function of the gtp hydrolysis rate @xmath17 .",
    "the discontinuous transition between quiescent and vesicle - producing membrane is clearly apparent , and is characterized by two hydrolysis rates ( high and low thresholds ) . between these two rates ,",

    "the parameters are the same as those used for fig.2 and 3 . ]      the adsorption flux @xmath3 , and the desorption rate @xmath17 , of coat components at the membrane tightly control vesicle secretion .",
    "recent fluorescence experiments on cops coat suggest that these rates vary with the amount of cargo present at the membrane .",
    "for copi , the presence of extra cargo leads to significant increase of the amount of coat components at the golgi membrane , which could reflect either the increase of @xmath3 or the decrease of @xmath17 @xcite . for copii ,",
    "frap experiments show that the coatomer exchange rate between the er membrane and the cytosol is doubled in the absence of cargo .",
    "this has been attributed to the increase of @xmath17 with decreasing cargo density @xcite .",
    "our model predicts that vesicles can only be secreted if the recycling rate @xmath4 is below a critical value ( fig.4 ) . by increasing the lifetime of the coatomers at the membrane ,",
    "the presence of cargo is thus expected to promote vesicle secretion , and a minimal amount of cargo at the membrane might actually be _ required _ for transport vesicle to be secreted .",
    "the two , high and low , recycling thresholds of fig.4 would then corresponds to two critical cargo densities ( low and high , respectively ) .    considering that newly synthesized cargo is brought to the membrane at a ( slow ) steady rate and is removed by vesiculation , membrane - bound cargo accumulates in the no - secretion regime , thereby decreasing @xmath4 and moving the system toward the secretion regime . above the high cargo density threshold ,",
    "the coat - machinery abruptly escapes the stationary pits regime and switches to vesicle production ( fig.4 ) .",
    "this results in a decrease of membrane - bound cargo , which increases @xmath4 and moves the system toward the quiescent state . below the low cargo density threshold ,",
    "vesicle secretion is switched off , letting the cargo accumulate until the high - density threshold is reached and vesicle production is resumed , starting a new cycle . under constant cargo in - flux , the system should thus periodically switch between quiescent phases and phases of vesicle secretion , following the hysteretic loop of fig.4 .",
    "if cargo synthesis is irregular , the membrane waits for sufficient accumulation of cargo between transient residences in the secreting state , where the accumulated cargo is released . the vesicle flux over time",
    "should then appear as an irregular pulsed signal .",
    "recording the total vesicle out - flux over an extended patch of secretory membrane over time should thus be of high interest .",
    "oscillatory or pulsed vesicle secretion would be a signature of the _ secretory switch _ uncovered by our theoretical analysis ( within our framework , steady secretion would indicate that cargo synthesis is sufficiently fast to compensate the secreted cargo ) .",
    "this accumulator mechanism would provide functional efficiency to the secretory membrane , as it would prevent the futile delivery of empty vesicles .",
    "strikingly , analysis of copi vesicles in mutant cells where arf1 is unable to hydrolyse gtp have revealed a much lower cargo content than in normal cells @xcite .",
    "this observation supports our prediction .",
    "indeed , in the absence of gtp hydrolysis ( @xmath112 ) , the switch is gone and vesicle secretion remains `` on '' regardless of the available amount of cargo .",
    "the existence of an hysteretic cycle can also positively impact on the rate of cargo delivery . at steady state",
    ", the flux of cargo delivered by a secretory membrane that would not possesses an unstable regime would automatically adjust to the flux of synthesized cargo . here , and",
    "while the system is traveling along the secretion branch of the hysteretic cycle , the flux of secreted cargo is mainly controlled by the kinetics of coat formation , and can potentially be much larger than the rate of cargo synthesis .",

    "vesiculation is only possible below a high tension threshold , and the oscillatory behavior described above may also result from variations of tension .",
    "secretion removes membrane area from the organelle and may increase its tension , while the fusion of incoming vesicles @xcite or other regulatory mechanisms @xcite , dynamically relaxe tension .",
    "vesicle secretion would thus occur only when enough membrane area has been accumulated to relax the tension .",
    "such a mechanism suggests a coordination of purely mechanical origin between absorption and release of vesicles , and could prevent the uncontroled shrinking of secretory compartments .",

    "the _ secretory switch _ revealed by our work is very robust and relies solely on the ( non - equilibrium ) thermodynamics of coat formation . beyond the qualitative agreement with experimental findings discussed in the previous section",
    ", we hope that future experiments can further test some of our predictions , which include : _ i _ ) the existence of metastable domains of intermediate size , _ ii _ ) the role of membrane tension in preventing the formation of curved protein coat , and eventually its involvement in the formation of flat lattices , _ iii _ ) the oscillatory or pulsed secretion of vesicles in time .    in this study",
    ", we have used the crudest possible description of the coat structure , thus avoiding to deal with structural details of specific protein coats .",
    "further experimental observation , _",
    "e.g _ on biomimetic systems , could motivate the building of models focusing on the dynamics of a single coat .",
    "supplementary degrees of freedom for the coat shape could be considered , allowing for the competitive growth of structures of various morphologies ( tubules @xcite , spherical caps and flat lattices @xcite ) , observed in living cells and biomimetic systems .    in the same spirit , the heterogeneties of the coat structures may be included in the model .",
    "the coupling beween the gtp hydrolysis rate and the curvature ( copi ) or the degree of polymerization ( copii ) revealed in recent experiments @xcite , suggest that monomers inactivation may be enhanced at the coat center and limited at the boundary .",
    "one could then imagine the formation of layer of active monomers preventing coat disassembly @xcite .",
    "such properties suggest a strong analogy with microtubules @xcite , and it is tempting to imagine exotic growth dynamics with shrinking cascades such as those observed for microtubules @xcite .",
