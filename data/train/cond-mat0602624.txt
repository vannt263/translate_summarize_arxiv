    "transport of electrons through a small metallic island is strongly affected by charging effects.@xcite tunneling of an electron on an island with capacity @xmath0 is associated with an energy of the order of the charging energy @xmath1 . at low temperature , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the charging - energy gap between ground state and first excited charge state , transport is suppressed . in a _ single - electron transistor _ ( set ) , an island connected to two leads by tunneling junctions ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) , this blockade of transport can be controlled by an additional gate , resulting in the well - known coulomb oscillations of current with respect to gate voltage.@xcite    if the island is well isolated from the leads , i.e. , the barrier resistances @xmath4 are high , @xmath5 electric transport is dominated by first - order transport in the tunnel conductance @xmath6 ( sequential tunneling ) . in the coulomb - blockade regime , where sequential tunneling is exponentially suppressed , inelastic cotunneling becomes important . in these processes of second order in @xmath6 ,",
    "the energetically unfavorable charging of the island occurs only virtually.@xcite but also at resonance , where sequential tunneling is present , there are higher - order transport contributions .",
    "they are associated with renormalization of charging energy and tunnel conductance due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood by mapping the set at low temperature and close to resonance to a many - channel kondo problem and performing a poor man s scaling analysis of the latter.@xcite for a quantitative analysis of these quantum - fluctuation effects , a systematic second - order perturbation expansion within a diagrammatic real - time technique has been performed@xcite and used to study different single - electron systems.@xcite in particular , a logarithmic reduction @xmath7 of the maximum conductance , indicating a renormalization of the tunnel conductance , has been found , in quantitative agreement with experimental observations.@xcite     is applied , such that no electrical current flows through the device .",
    "a gate voltage sets the working point and thereby the charging - energy gap @xmath3 of the set . ]    in electron transport , the transfer of charge and heat are connected to each other .",
    "this gives rise to thermoelectric effects such as the thermal conductance and the thermopower @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the voltage due to a temperature difference @xmath10 in the absence of a charge current @xmath11 . with the help of onsager relations,@xcite the thermopower can be related to the average energy @xmath12 of the transported electrons relative to the fermi energy : @xmath13 in macroscopic conductors ,",
    "the thermopower is of the order of @xmath14 , which , in general , is very small .",
    "this is due to the fact that the product of density of states and electron velocity squared , determining the contribution of electrons of a certain energy to the current , varies only slowly , namely on the scale provided by the fermi energy .",
    "therefore , one can perform a sommerfeld expansion of @xmath12 . the zeroth - order term of the sommerfeld expansion vanishes .",
    "the next - order correction , that accounts for an asymmetry of the product mentioned above around the fermi energy , yields an extra factor of @xmath15 .",

    "an even larger thermopower is generated by sequential tunneling processes .",
    "they are modeled by a delta - function peaked density of states around @xmath3 , for which the sommerfeld expansion is not applicable .",
    "instead , a direct evaluation of @xmath17 leads to @xmath18 . in conclusion , at the crossover from sequential to cotunneling the thermopower can reach values of the order of @xmath19 .    by now a few experiments on thermal conductance or thermopower in quantum dots",
    "have been performed.@xcite thermoelectric effects in various mesoscopic systems have also been studied theoretically.@xcite quantum dots with discrete@xcite ( single - particle ) energy level spectrum as well as dots closer to the metallic ( quasi - continuous ) limit@xcite have been compared to sequential - tunneling theory . for",
    "increased coupling and lower temperatures , systems of discrete level structure showed signatures of cotunneling@xcite and also of kondo physics.@xcite for the system under consideration in the present paper , a metallic single - electron transistor , thermopower has been investigated by taking into account sequential@xcite and cotunneling@xcite processes .    in this paper , we study the effect of quantum fluctuations on the thermal conductance and thermopower of a metallic single - electron transistor with a large number of transverse channels .",
    "thermopower provides a direct access to measure a renormalization of the charging - energy gap due to quantum fluctuations since it is closely related to the average energy of tunneled electrons .",

    "the temperature dependence of the maximum position reflects the temperature - dependent renormalization of the charging - energy gap .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the low - temperature properties of thermal conductance and thermopower of a metallic single - electron transistor .",
    "we presented two approximation schemes for analyzing higher - order contributions associated with quantum fluctuations : a systematic perturbative expansion in the tunnel - coupling strength and the nonperturbative resonant - tunneling approximation .",
    "both these schemes reveal qualitatively similar physical effects and coincide for weak coupling .",
    "in particular , we find that quantum - fluctuation - induced renormalizations of the charging - energy gap and the tunnel - coupling strength affect the thermoelectric properties .",
    "they yield logarithmic temperature dependences typical for the ( many - channel ) kondo effect .    for the thermal conductance , renormalization of tunnel - coupling strength and charging - energy gap results in a suppression and a broadening of the resonance features , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ g_tfig ] ) .",
    "the effect of charging - energy - gap renormalization is most striking in the thermopower .",
    "it destroys the universal low - temperature scaling that would follow from considering sequential and cotunneling processes only ( fig .",
    "[ slowt ] ) .",
    "the reduction of the charging - energy gap is reflected in a reduction of the slope of the thermopower at resonance , and in a shift of the maximum s position away from resonance ( figs .",
    "[ renormfiga ] and [ renormfigb ] , respectively ) .",
    "this is due to the fact , that thermopower can be interpreted as measure of the average energy of transported particles .",
    "therefore , an experimental observation of the charging - energy gap renormalization in the thermopower would provide an appealing complement to the tunnel - coupling renormalization measured in the electrical conductance .",
    "@xcite certainly measuring such effects in thermopower is more challenging , as precise control of temperature bias and gate voltage is required .",
