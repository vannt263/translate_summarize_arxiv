    "many years ago kubo @xcite has proven the general sum rule for diagonal dynamic ( frequency dependent ) conductivity @xmath1 , which holds for any system of charged particles irrespective of interactions , temperature or statistics .",
    "this sum rule is usually written as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 specifies the type of charged particles , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the respective densities and charges .    for the system of electrons in a solid eq .",
    "( [ kub_sum ] ) takes the form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of electrons and @xmath8 is the plasma frequency",
    ".    however , in any real experiment we are not dealing with an infinite range of frequencies .",
    "if one considers electrons in a crystal and limits himself to the electrons in a particular ( e.g. conduction ) band , neglecting interband transitions , the general sum rule ( [ f_sum_el ] ) reduces to the single band sum rule of kubo @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bare dispersion as defined by the effective single band hamiltonian , while @xmath11 is the momentum distribution function ( occupation number ) , which is in general defined by the _ interacting _ retarded electronic green s function @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the usual fermi distribution . in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) @xmath15 represents an ultraviolet cut - off , frequency , which is assumed to be larger than the bandwidth of the low energy band , but smaller than the gap to other bands .",
    "the function @xmath16 accounts for the cut - off dependence , which arises from the presence of drude spectral weight beyond @xmath15 @xcite and is unity if we formally set @xmath15 to infinity while ignoring the interband transitions .",
    "although the general sum rule is certainly preserved , the optical integral @xmath17 is not a conserved quantity since both @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite depend on temperature @xmath18 , and also on details of interactions @xcite .",
    "this dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath18 and other parameters of the system under study has been termed the `` sum rule violation '' .",
    "it was actively studied experimentally , especially in cuprates , where pronounced anomalies were observed both in c - axis and in - plane conductivity both in normal and superconducting states @xcite .",
    "the finite cut - off effects were extensively studied in several theoretical papers on the @xmath18 dependence of the optical integral @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the cut - off was considered in the context of electrons coupled to phonons . in a simple drude model , @xmath20 and",
    "the sum rule can only be `` violated '' due to the presence of @xmath16 . integrating over @xmath21 and expanding for @xmath22",
    ", one can see that @xmath23 for infinite cut - off , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , but for a finite cut - off @xmath16 contains the term proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 changes with @xmath18 , then one obtains a sum rule `` violation '' even if @xmath28 is @xmath18 independent @xcite .",
    "other aspects of cut - off dependence were discussed recently in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present study",
    "we neglect the cut - off effects in optical integral from the outset .",
    "our goal is to study @xmath19 dependence on @xmath18 and a number of interaction parameters , determining the electronic properties of strongly correlated systems , such as cuprates . in this context",
    "we shall discuss the problem of a possible `` violation '' of the optical sum rule in the normal ( non superconducting ) state of strongly correlated electronic systems , using our recently proposed dmft+@xmath0 approach @xcite , as applied to dynamic conductivity in two typical models of such systems : the `` hot  spot '' model of the pseudogap state @xcite and disordered anderson  hubbard model @xcite .",
    "our aim is both to check the consistency of dmft+@xmath0 approach as applied to calculations of optical conductivity , as well as to demonstrate rather important dependences of the optical integral @xmath19 not only on @xmath18 , but also on such important characteristics as pseudogap width , disorder and correlation strength , making ( single band ) sum rule `` violation '' rather ubiquitous for any strongly correlated system , even neglecting the cut - off effects .",
    "characteristic feature of the general sum rule as expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ dist_fun ] ) is that the integral @xmath19 over frequency in the l.h.s .",
    "is calculated via two - particle property ( dynamic conductivity , determined by two - particle green s function , in general , with appropriate vertex corrections ) , while the r.h.s .",
    "is determined by the single - particle characteristics , such as bare dispersion and occupation number ( [ dist_fun ] ) ( determined by a single - particle green s function ) .",
    "thus , checking the validity of this sum rule , we are in fact thoroughly checking the consistency of any theoretical approach , used in our model calculations .",
    "our generalized dynamical mean field theory ( dmft+@xmath0 ) approach @xcite , supplying the standard dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite with an additional `` external '' self - energy @xmath0 ( due to any kind of interaction outside the scope of dmft , which is exact only in infinite dimensions ) , provides an effective method to calculate both single- and two - particle properties @xcite .",
    "the consistency check of this new approach is obviously of great interest by itself .",
    "we shall also see , that it gives a kind of a new insight in the problem of sum - rule `` violation '' .",
    "pseudogap phenomena in strongly correlated systems have essential spatial length scale dependence @xcite . to merge pseudogap physics and strong electron correlations we have generalized the dynamical - mean field theory @xcite by inclusion of the dependence on correlation length of pseudogap fluctuations via additional ( momentum dependent ) self - energy @xmath29 .",
    "this self - energy @xmath29 describes non - local dynamical correlations induced either by short - ranged collective sdw - like antiferromagnetic spin or cdw - like charge fluctuations @xcite .    to calculate @xmath29 in two - dimensional `` hot spots '' model @xcite for an electron moving in the random field of pseudogap fluctuations ( considered to be static and gaussian ) with dominant scattering momentum transfers of the order of characteristic vector @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the lattice spacing ) , we used @xcite the recursion procedure proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is controlled by two main physical characteristics of the pseudogap state : @xmath32 ( pseudogap amplitude ) , which characterizes the energy scale of the pseudogap , and @xmath33  the inverse correlation length of short range sdw ( cdw ) fluctuations . both parameters @xmath32 and @xmath34 , determining pseudogap behavior , can in principle be calculated from the microscopic model at hand @xcite .",
    "weakly doped one - band hubbard model with repulsive coulomb interaction @xmath35 on a square lattice with nearest and next nearest neighbour hopping was numerically investigated within this generalized dmft+@xmath0 self - consistent approach , as described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "briefly , the dmft+@xmath0 self - consistent loop looks like as follows .",
    "first we guess some initial local ( dmft ) electron self - energy @xmath36 .",
    "second we compute the @xmath37-dependent `` external '' self - energy @xmath29 which is in general case a functional of @xmath36 . then neglecting interference effects between the self - energies ( which in fact is the major assumption of our approach ) we can set up and solve the lattice problem of dmft @xcite .",
    "finally we define effective anderson single impurity problem which is to be solved by any `` impurity solver '' ( we mostly use numerical renormalization group - nrg ) to close dmft+@xmath0 equations .",
    "the additive form of self - energy is in fact an advantage of our approach @xcite .",
    "it allows one to preserve the set of self - consistent equations of standard dmft @xcite .",
    "however there are two distinctions from conventional dmft . during each dmft",
    "iteration we recalculate corresponding * p*-dependent self - energy @xmath38)$ ] via an approximate scheme , taking into account interactions with collective modes or order parameter fluctuations , and the local green function @xmath39 is `` dressed '' by @xmath29 at each step .",
    "when input and output green s functions ( or self - energies ) converge to each other ( with prescribed accuracy ) we consider the obtained solution to be selfconsistent .",
    "physically it corresponds to the account of some `` external '' ( e.g. pseudogap ) fluctuations , characterized by an important length scale @xmath34 , into fermionic `` bath '' surrounding the effective anderson impurity of the usual dmft .",
    "both cases of strongly correlated metals and doped mott insulators were considered @xcite .",
    "energy dispersions , quasiparticle damping , spectral functions and arpes spectra calculated within dmft+@xmath0 , all show a pseudogap effects close to the fermi level of quasiparticle band .    in ref .",
    "@xcite this dmft+@xmath0 procedure was generalized to calculate two - particle properties , such as dynamic conductivity , using previously developed recursion procedure for vertex corrections due to pseudogap fluctuations @xcite , producing typical pseudogap anomalies of optical conductivity and dependence of these anomalies on correlation strength @xmath35 .",
    "below we use the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the sum - rule in `` hot spots '' model .    to calculate optical integral @xmath19",
    "we have just used the conductivity data of ref .",
    "@xcite ( extended to a wider frequency range needed to calculate @xmath19 ) , while the r.h.s of ( [ 1 ] ) was recalculated , using recursion relations for @xmath29 and the whole self - consistency dmft+@xmath0 loop .",
    "all calculations have been done for a tight - binding `` bare '' spectrum on the square lattice , with the nearest neighbor transfer integral @xmath40 and next nearest neighbor transfer integral @xmath41 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present our typical data for the real part of conductivity ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ev , band filling @xmath44 , temperature @xmath45 ) for different values of hubbard interaction @xmath46 and fixed pseudogap amplitude @xmath47 ( correlation length @xmath48 ) .",
    "it is obvious from these data , that optical integral @xmath19 is different for all of these curves , actually its value drops with the growth of @xmath35 ( along with damping of pseudogap anomalies @xcite ) .",
    "however , the single band optical sum - rule ( [ 1 ] ) is satisfied within our numerical accuracy , as seen from table i. the small `` deficiency '' in the values of @xmath19 in table i is naturally due to a finite frequency integration interval over conductivity data of fig .",

    "[ fig9 ] we show the temperature dependence of the normalized optical integral , for different degrees of disorder . in anderson  hubbard model it appears to be significantly stronger , than in `` hot spots '' model ( see above ) , and decreases with the growth of disorder .",

    "based on dmft+@xmath0 approach , we have studied the single band optical sum rule for two typical strongly correlated systems , which are outside the scope of the standard dmft : ( i ) the `` hot spots '' model of the pseudogap state , which takes into account important nonlocal correlations due to afm(cdw ) short - range order fluctuations and ( ii ) anderson - hubbard model , which includes strong disorder effects , leading to disorder induced metal - insulator ( anderson ) transition , alongside with mott transition .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that the single band optical sum rule ( [ 1 ] ) is satisfied for both models , confirming the self - consistency of dmft+@xmath0 approach for calculation of two - particle properties .    however , the optical integral @xmath53 , entering the single band sum rule ( [ 1 ] ) is non universal and depends on the parameters of the model under consideration .",
    "most of the previous studies addressed its ( relatively weak ) temperature dependence .",
    "here we have analyzed dependences on essential parameters of our models , showing that these may lead to rather strong `` violations '' of the optical sum rule .",
    "as most of the parameters under discussion may be varied in different kinds of experiments , these dependences should be taken into account in the analysis of optical experiments on strongly correlated systems .",
