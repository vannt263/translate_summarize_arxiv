    "supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) describes interacting gluons and their supersymmetric partners , the gluinos .",
    "as it is a gauge theory containing fermionic degrees of freedom , it is in this respect similar to qcd .",
    "an essential difference , however , is that gluinos are majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group . in minkowski space the ( on - shell )",
    "lagrangian of sym is composed out of the gluon fields @xmath0 and the gluino field @xmath1 , and reads @xmath2 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the usual non - abelian field strength and @xmath4 denotes the gauge covariant derivative in the adjoint representation .",
    "the fields @xmath1 and @xmath0 are transformed into each other by the supersymmetry transformation .",
    "the gluino mass term breaks supersymmetry softly .",
    "some properties of sym are expected to be similar to qcd @xcite .",
    "it is asymptotically free and is assumed to show confinement .",
    "the determination of its low - energy properties , including the spectrum of particles , is a non - perturbative problem .",
    "the `` physical '' particles are bound states of gluons and gluinos , and if supersymmetry is unbroken , they would form supermultiplets .",
    "there are several motivations for the numerical investigation of sym on the lattice .",
    "one of them is to understand the non - perturbative interaction of the gluinos in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "there exist theoretical predictions for the low energy effective theory @xcite that can be compared to the lattice results .",
    "another motivation for the numerical investigations of sym on the lattice is related to possible connections to ordinary qcd , as provided by the orientifold planar equivalence @xcite .",
    "results of previous investigations of sym on the lattice by our collaboration can be found in @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "sym on the lattice has also been investigated with ginsparg - wilson fermions , in the domain wall @xcite as well as in the overlap formulation @xcite . for large lattice volumes and small lattice spacings",
    "these formulations require , however , a significantly larger amount of computing resources than the wilson formulation .",
    "the gain of no need for tuning the position of the zero gluino mass point does not compensate by far the advantage of wilson fermions .",
    "our current studies of sym are focussed on the bound states of gluons and gluinos , in particular on an exotic particle state in the spectrum that arises due to the fermions being in the adjoint representation .",
    "this particle is a spin 1/2 majorana fermion and is called gluino - glue .",
    "it can be created by operators combining the field strength and the gluino field , the simplest example being @xmath5,\\ ] ] with @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "such a bound state containing a single fermion does not occur in qcd , but analogous particles exist in models similar to qcd with an arbitrary number of quark flavours in the adjoint representation .",
    "since supersymmetry is generically broken in any non - trivial theory on the lattice @xcite it has to be ensured that it is restored in the continuum limit .",
    "a necessary condition for unbroken supersymmetry is the degeneracy of fermionic and bosonic masses . in a supersymmetric theory",
    "the fermionic gluino - glue state must therefore be part of a multiplet containing also bosonic particles with the same mass .",
    "the behaviour of the gluino - glue particle provides an important signal for the supersymmetric limit of the theory .",
    "it is expected that in sym a fine - tuning of the bare gluino mass parameter in the continuum limit is enough to approach the symmetries of the continuum theory @xcite .",
    "these symmetries include chiral symmetry and supersymmetry .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the existence of a supersymmetric chiral continuum limit needs to be confronted with the numerical lattice simulations .",
    "the chiral limit , the continuum limit , and the infinite volume limit can only be extrapolated from the results of these simulations . in qcd",
    "there are good estimates about the scales and parameters that are necessary to get reliable results , together with systematic estimates of the induced errors . in sym the influence of parameters like the finite volume and non - zero lattice spacing may be different .",
    "it is therefore important to have a detailed understanding of their effects in order to be able to approach the supersymmetric limit .",
    "the previous results of our simulations have not yet shown the expected degeneracy of the fermionic and bosonic masses @xcite .",
    "the obtained mass of the gluino - glue has been larger than the other masses of its lightest possible superpartners .",
    "however , the masses were obtained at a fixed lattice spacing and without a detailed analysis of the finite size effects .",
    "our most recent investigations indicate that the influence of the finite lattice spacing is larger than expected .",
    "this provides a possible source of the supersymmetry breaking in the simulation .    in this work",
    "we want to scrutinize the influence of the finite volume .",
    "if it is large , it provides another possible explanation for the gap between fermionic and bosonic masses .",
    "if it is smaller than expected then the lattice artifacts have to be reduced by performing simulations at smaller lattice spacings .    in our studies",
    "the mass of the gluino - glue particle has typically been the one determined with the best accuracy .",
    "therefore it is well suited to estimate the effects of the finite lattice size . in order to estimate the influence on supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "the mass of the adjoint version of the @xmath7 meson ( @xmath8 , a pseudoscalar bound state of gluinos ) is also considered .",
    "in our investigations we have employed the lattice formulation of sym proposed by curci and veneziano @xcite .",
    "the gauge field is represented by link variables @xmath9 in the gauge group su(@xmath10 ) .",
    "the corresponding gauge action is the wilson action built from the plaquette variables @xmath11 .",
    "the gluinos are described by wilson fermions in the adjoint representation . in its basic form",
    "the complete lattice action reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wilson - dirac operator @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hopping parameter @xmath15 is related to the bare gluino mass via @xmath16 .    while the link variables @xmath17 are in the fundamental representation of the gauge group , the variables @xmath18 in the wilson - dirac operator are the corresponding elements in the adjoint representation . in our present investigations",
    "the gauge group is su(2 ) , the fundamental representation is a doublet and the adjoint one a triplet . in this case",
    "the adjoint gauge field is given by @xmath19^{ab}=2\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{tr } } } [ u^\\dag_\\mu(x ) t^a u_\\mu(x ) t^b ] $ ] , where @xmath20 are the generators of the gauge group , normalised such that @xmath21=\\delta^{ab}$ ] .    in our simulations",
    "the basic form of the lattice action has been modified with the following improvements : in order to reduce the lattice artifacts a tree - level symanzik improved gauge action has been used instead of the simple wilson gauge action .",
    "one level of stout smearing has been applied to the link fields in the wilson - dirac operator to reduce lattice artifacts also in the fermionic part of the action .",
    "the lattice action explicitly breaks supersymmetry and in addition the chiral u(1)@xmath22 symmetry .",
    "however , to recover the continuum symmetries the necessary fine - tuning of supersymmetry and the u(1)@xmath22 symmetry can be achieved through the same parameter , the bare gluino mass ( i.e.  @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric continuum limit coincides with the chiral continuum limit of the theory .",
    "an important similarity of sym to yang - mills theory is confinement .",
    "the static potential between quark sources in the fundamental representation of the gauge group shows no signal of a string breaking .",
    "the low energy effective action is built out of bound states of the elementary fields .",
    "the glueballs of yang - mills theory are completed with the mesonic states ( gluino - balls ) and the fermionic gluino - glue particle .",
    "the proposed supersymmetric low energy effective actions are constructed from two multiplets of particles @xcite .",
    "the lighter multiplet consists of glueballs and a gluino - glue state .",
    "the heavier multiplet is built from the mesons and a gluino - glue state . as required by supersymmetry ,",
    "each multiplet consists of a scalar , a pseudoscalar , and a fermionic spin 1/2 particle .    on the lattice",
    "the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 glueball operators are constructed from the link variables .",
    "the mesonic particles are the @xmath25 represented by the operator @xmath26 and the @xmath8 by @xmath27 .",
    "since the model contains only one species ( `` flavour '' ) of gluinos , all possible mesons are `` flavour diagonal '' .",
    "consequently , their correlation functions contain disconnected parts in addition to the connected ones , as it is the case in qcd for flavour diagonal mesons .",
    "in addition to the above mesons , we consider the adjoint pion ( @xmath28 ) , which is the pion in the corresponding theory with two majorana fermions in the adjoint representation . the correlator of this particle is the connected contribution of the @xmath8 correlator .",
    "the @xmath28 is not a physical particle in sym , which only contains one majorana fermion .",
    "however , it can be defined in a partially quenched setup , in which the model is supplemented by a second species of gluinos and the corresponding bosonic ghost gluinos , in the same way as for one - flavour qcd @xcite .",
    "the reason for considering the @xmath28 is the following . in the limit of a vanishing gluino mass , the bare parameter @xmath15 has to be tuned to the critical value @xmath29 ( chiral limit ) that corresponds to the chiral theory in the continuum limit .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is most easily obtained from the dependence of the @xmath28-mass on @xmath15 . on the basis of arguments involving the ozi - approximation of sym @xcite",
    ", the adjoint pion mass is expected to vanish for a massless gluino .",
    "the @xmath28 yields a more precise signal for the tuning than the supersymmetric ward identities .",
    "however , in previous studies we have checked that both signals lead to a consistent value of @xmath29 @xcite .    for both the @xmath25 and @xmath8 mesons",
    "the correlators contain a significant contribution from disconnected diagrams ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : techmass ] ) , especially on larger lattices and small adjoint pion masses . as in comparable cases in lattice qcd",
    ", this contribution leads to a bad signal to noise ratio in the correlators . using the techniques detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : techmass ] , the gluino - glue mass can be obtained with an accuracy significantly better compared to the other particles of the spectrum ( apart from the unphysical adjoint pion ) .    in previous investigations",
    "the predicted multiplet structure of the particles has not been found in the mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the mass of the gluino - glue particle appeared to be heavier than the masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar states .",
    "a breaking of supersymmetry in the theory on the lattice is induced by the finite lattice spacing and the finite lattice extent .",
    "the former is an unavoidable consequence of the discretisation ; the latter is due to the anti - periodic ( thermal ) boundary conditions implemented for the gluinos .",
    "it is important to have an estimate of these effects .",
    "if they had an opposite sign , they could compensate each other and suggest a wrong supersymmetric point .",
    "alternatively , they could sum up to the total supersymmetry breaking and it would be necessary to investigate both of them in order to disentangle their effects .    in our numerical simulations",
    "we have applied a polynomial hybrid monte carlo ( phmc ) algorithm . in a two step procedure , in the metropolis step a better polynomial approximation is used than in the integrator of the molecular trajectory .",
    "the remaining error is compensated by a reweighting .",
    "further details of the simulations algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the simulation at the smallest lattice spacings requires a large number of configurations to get a reasonable statistical error of the correlation functions .",
    "a further problem arises from the dependence of the adjoint pion mass on the lattice volume .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",

    "[ eq : fitansatz ] , and the reduced fit ( red .",

    "@xmath31 is the sommer scale parameter . ]",
    "the adjoint pion mass gets smaller on the smaller lattices .",
    "hence , for a fixed value of @xmath15 the simulations are shifted towards the chiral limit when the lattice volume is reduced . in the vicinity of the chiral limit",
    "low eigenvalues of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator occur .",
    "the polynomial approximation in the phmc algorithm has a larger error in this case and a compensation with correction factors is necessary .",
    "to obtain these factors we have calculated an approximation of the lowest eigenvalue on each of the configurations . whenever this value has been below the threshold determined by the polynomial approximation , the correct fermionic contribution of the 100 lowest eigenvalues has been calculated . from this contribution",
    "the correction factors of the reweighting step have been obtained .",
    "this reweighting leads to an additional increase of the statistical error on the smaller lattice volumes .",

    "[ eq : massfit ] is a good approximation in the considered region .",
    "we have applied a method that combines fit values of several fitting intervals and their correlated chi - square to get an estimation of the mass and the statistical and systematic error @xcite .",
    "the gluino - glue correlator has been obtained using different smearing techniques .",
    "the link fields are smeared using ape smearing , the fermionic fields using jacobi smearing . without any smearing the links @xmath45 in @xmath46 should be the same fundamental links as in the gauge part of the action . the wilson - dirac operator @xmath13 , on the other hand , should contain the one - level stout smeared links in the adjoint representation , that are used in the fermionic part of the action .",
    "in addition to this approach , the one - level stout smearing has also been applied to the @xmath45 fields .",

    "it is instructive to compare the masses of the @xmath8 and the @xmath28 , since their difference shows the influence of the disconnected part . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fixedkappaetapion ] the dependence of these masses on the lattice volume is shown .",
    "on the smallest lattice both masses deviate from the behaviour expected from the fits .",
    "this is presumably due to the larger contribution of excited states to the correlator , since only smaller values of @xmath42 enter .",
    "a second observation is that at smaller lattice volumes both masses appear to approach each other .",
    "thus at smaller volumes the influence of the disconnected part of the @xmath8 correlator is relatively smaller compared to the connected one .    at small @xmath42",
    "the contribution of the connected part is much larger than the disconnected part , whereas at intermediate distances and close to the chiral limit the disconnected part yields a significant contribution .",
    "the larger statistical error of the @xmath8 on the largest lattices is due to the larger statistical fluctuations of the disconnected part .",
    "the total error on a small lattice seems to be underestimated for the @xmath8 particle due to these systematic uncertainties .",
    "smearing techniques or a larger temporal extent of the lattice could lead to better results .",
    "because of these systematic uncertainties of the @xmath8 mass and the larger statistical error , the best signal for the finite size effects is obtained from the gluino - glue mass .",
    "in quantum field theory in a finite volume the propagation and interactions of particles are different from those in an infinite volume . this can be understood as the modification of the polarized vacuum within a compton wavelength around a particle due to the deformation by the finite boundaries of the box .",
    "the infinite volume mass @xmath51 of the particle is shifted due to the influence of the finite box size @xmath52 , @xmath53    the mass shift @xmath54 has been studied to all orders in perturbation theory in massive field theories in the continuum in @xcite . a similar investigation in the framework of field theory on the lattice has been made in @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour was found to be @xmath55 with parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this behaviour is quite generic , since it does not depend on the specific form of the interactions .",
    "it also applies to the masses of stable bound states in a confining theory . for glueballs in lattice gauge theory",

    "we fitted the dependence of the masses on the finite box size @xmath52 by the general asymptotic relation eq .",

    "we have used a numerical fit to obtain the constants @xmath51 , @xmath56 , and @xmath59 .    we have carried out simulations at several box sizes @xmath52 , see table [ tab : summary ] . the temporal extent @xmath40 of the lattice",
    "has been chosen to be about twice the spatial extent @xmath52 .",
    "this combination has been chosen since it is the usual setup in all our simulations .",
    "the first estimation of finite size effects is done at a fixed value of the bare gluino mass defined by the hopping parameter @xmath30 . to visualize the influence on the mass gap between bosonic and fermionic states , the gluino - glue mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fixedkappa ] together with the mass of the bosonic @xmath8 meson .",
    "our ansatz eq .",
    "[ eq : fitansatz ] for the functional dependence of the mass on the lattice volume is valid only in the asymptotic region of large @xmath52 and might fail for the smallest lattice sizes . to check its validity",

    "the dimensionless scale @xmath60 corresponds to the length in femtometers if the sommer parameter @xmath31 is set to @xmath61 as in qcd .",
    "note that we have always taken the value of @xmath31 obtained by an extrapolation to the chiral limit of the data obtained on the @xmath62 and @xmath63 lattices .",
    "the gluino - glue gets a positive mass shift at smaller volumes , whereas the @xmath8 gets a negative one .",
    "this clearly shows that the finite lattice size enhances the supersymmetry breaking induced by lattice discretisation and nonvanishing gluino mass in our model : at smaller lattices an additional splitting of the bosonic and fermionic masses is introduced .    in our previous simulations at",
    "larger box sizes the gluino - glue particle has been the heaviest of the measured low energy states . since finite size effects are small in this case , this indicates that the mass shift induced by the discretisation artifacts is also positive .",
    "so , both finite size and finite lattice spacing effects add up to a total mass splitting between bosonic and fermionic states indicating the breaking of supersymmetry .    in case of the gluino - glue , eq .",

    "this reduction becomes important for the smallest lattice sizes , where the masses are obtained from fits of the correlation function at smaller distances .",
    "another reason are the systematic uncertainties in the mass determination of the @xmath8 at smaller lattice sizes ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : techmass ] ) . nevertheless , neglecting the smallest lattice size , the fit seems to reproduce the general behaviour of the mass gap at different lattice volumes .    above a box size of about @xmath64 ( corresponding to 1.2 fm in qcd units ) the statistical errors and the systematic errors of the finite size effects",
    "are of the same order and hence the finite size effects can be neglected at present .",
    "this is an important estimate for the minimal lattice size required for the simulations .    in the following we focus our discussion on the gluino - glue since the signal of the finite size effects is much clearer for this particle .",
    "final results for masses in sym should be obtained as extrapolations towards the infinite volume limit , the continuum limit , and the chiral limit .",

    "the finite size effects are expected to get larger in the vicinity of the chiral limit .",
