    "the aim of this paper is to study quantitatively the constraints of the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) on a class of composite higgs models @xcite in which the higgs arises as a pseudo - goldstone boson of some strongly interacting sector . in these models , a global symmetry @xmath1 , in which the standard model ( sm ) symmetry is embedded ,",
    "is spontaneously broken to a subgroup @xmath2 , yielding a definite number of goldstone bosons , among which the @xmath3 doublet is identified as the usual higgs .",
    "the physical higgs boson acquires a mass through radiative corrections from an additional explicit breaking of @xmath1 .",
    "the scale of the spontaneous breaking @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath5 , whereas the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is generated at a lower scale , @xmath6  gev .",
    "the hierarchy between those two scales can be expressed in term of a parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the first composite higgs models derived more than 20 years ago @xcite were problematic because of the presence of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , and the lack of calculability .",
    "it has been recently shown that models with a warped fifth dimension lead to a similar effective 4d theory , but with a different realisation of the fermions , avoiding fcnc . moreover ,",
    "these models become calculable in the limit of a large number of colors . in this paper",
    "we will consider a 4d low - energy effective description of a 5d model approximately preserving the custodial @xmath8 symmetry @xcite .",
    "in particular we consider a two - site model @xcite where only the first resonance of the full tower of kaluza - klein modes appears .",
    "the simplest possible extension of @xmath8 yielding 4 goldstones when broken is @xmath9 , so we take the latter to be the spontaneously broken global symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "the importance of custodial symmetry comes from the ewpt and in particular from the necessity to protect the peskin - takeuchi @xmath10 parameter @xcite from large contributions at tree level .",
    "it has been stressed by barbieri et al .",
    "@xcite that an important correction to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath11 and @xmath10 is generated in this class of composite models by a shift @xmath12 in the coupling of the higgs to any other field .",
    "this is equivalent to having an effective mass for the higgs : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cutoff of the theory .",
    "this infrared correction to @xmath11 and @xmath10 makes the theoretical predictions not compatible with the experimental data for a reasonable choice of @xmath15 ( see figure  [ fig : e1e3 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement can be re - obtained if an extra positive contribution to @xmath10 from the new states is present .",
    "but as soon as the contribution to @xmath10 becomes important , one should keep control of the corresponding correction to the decay @xmath16 , which is also strongly constrained by the electroweak precision measurements . in the following , we propose to make a complete and quantitative computation of the ewpt in order to evaluate the bounds on the parameters of the model .",
    "the minimal model of a composite higgs preserving custodial symmetry is based on @xmath0 breaking .",
    "an additional @xmath17 local symmetry is needed to give the correct hypercharge to the fermions . since @xmath8 is isomorphic to @xmath18",
    ", one can choose the sm gauge group factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 to be respectively @xmath3 and an admixture of the third component of @xmath21 and the x - hypercharge .",
    "the goldstone bosons come from a scalar field @xmath22 transforming like a @xmath23 of @xmath9 , uncharged under @xmath17 .",
    "this scalar field is taken to be dimensionless and subject to the normalised constraint : @xmath24 one can expand @xmath22 around a @xmath8-preserving vacuum state @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the broken @xmath28 generators given by : @xmath29 we denote by @xmath30 the first four components of @xmath22 , which is an @xmath8 symmetric vector , and by @xmath31 its fifth component , so that we have : @xmath32    in the most general model many fermionic and vectorial resonances may appear , but since we focus on low - energy phenomenology , we take into account the first fermionic resonance @xmath33 only .",
    "we also restrict the elementary sm fermions to the third generation , namely @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , since the contribution to the ewpt from the first two generations is negligible .",
    "@xmath33 is a @xmath23 of @xmath9 , broken down to a bidoublet of @xmath18 and a singlet : @xmath37 .",
    "it is charged under @xmath17 with hypercharge @xmath38 . under the sm gauge group",
    ", @xmath33 decomposes as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 has the same quantum numbers as the right - handed top quark @xmath35 , the @xmath41 doublet has the same quantum numbers as @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is made of two fermions of electric charge @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the mass mixing between the elementary and composite sectors is achieved through the simplest linear mixing : @xmath46 notice that we have omitted the sm gauge bosons and the composite vector resonances which may appear . in the following",
    "we will also take into account a vector field @xmath47 in the adjoint representation , a @xmath48 of @xmath9 .",
    "the theory defined by this lagrangian is not renormalisable in 4d , but as we mentioned before it is fully satisfactory in the 5d picture .",
    "the diagonalisation is achieved by mixing the elementary fermions with their composite partners . in particular , for @xmath49 , the lagrangian becomes diagonal after the rotations : @xmath50 where we have defined : @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53 parametrise the degree of compositeness of the left- and right - handed top quark respectively . in this regime ,",
    "the mass of the two heavy doublets @xmath41 and @xmath43 is close to @xmath54 , whereas the right - handed top partner @xmath40 appears at a different scale @xmath55 .",
    "both @xmath41 and @xmath40 have their mass increased by level repulsion since they are mixing with the sm fields @xmath42 and @xmath35 : @xmath56    since the linear coupling @xmath57 and @xmath58 break the @xmath9 symmetry explicitly , a potential that removes the goldstone degeneracy is generated and @xmath22 gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) different from @xmath59 : @xmath60 in this case , the diagonalisation becomes more complicated than equations ( [ equ : phil]-[equ : phir ] ) since it involves a @xmath61 matrix .",
    "the masses of the composite top partners @xmath10 , @xmath62 and @xmath40 get corrected by an amount proportional to @xmath63 , while the elementary top quark obtains a mass , given at the leading order in @xmath15 by : @xmath64    the custodial @xmath8 symmetry is broken only by the @xmath57 operator of equation ( [ equ : lagr ] ) , and therefore we expect the contribution from new physics to peskin - takeuchi @xmath10 parameter and to the @xmath16 to be of order @xmath63 times the sm values .    finally ,",
    "requesting the mass of the top quark to be its measured value @xmath65  gev @xcite , the model can be fully parametrised in terms of four dimensionless parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "as we mentioned above , important constraints on the parameters of this model come from the ewpt , and in particular from the oblique corrections associated with @xmath11 and @xmath10 , which are strongly bounded by lep experiments .",
    "since the top yukawa @xmath67 is much larger than the other yukawa couplings and also larger than the gauge couplings @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the correction to @xmath10 from new physics will be dominated by a loop of third - generation fermions , namely the elementary @xmath70 and the composite @xmath33 . on the other hand , the top partners will not contribute significantly to @xmath11 .",
    "the main correction to it comes from the composite vector resonance @xmath47 at tree - level .",
    "it can be evaluated quantitatively using the 5d picture of this model as a function of the @xmath47 mass . in our case , considering only the first resonance instead of the whole kaluza - klein tower , we have @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mass of the @xmath28 vectors . using the 5d picture",
    ", we can compute it to be @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath47 field is directly proportional to the scale of new physics : @xmath74 .",
    "the coupling @xmath75 is roughly imposed by the large number of colors in the composite sector : for @xmath76  gev , we fix the mass of the vector resonance to @xmath77  tev @xcite . hence @xmath78 and we have : @xmath79 for a significant @xmath63 , this contribution to @xmath11 is large but may still be compatible with the experimental data provided that there is also a large positive contribution from the new physics to @xmath10 .",
    "this last point may be problematic since @xmath10 is related to the correction of the @xmath80 vertex , which is also strongly constrained by measurements .",
    "this non - oblique correction is denoted by @xmath81 and is defined as the modification of the coupling of the @xmath82 boson to left - handed bottom quarks : @xmath83 like for @xmath10 , the main contributions to @xmath81 come from the top partners , due to the large top yukawa coupling .",
    "the oblique corrections to the electroweak precision observables coming from the sm and from the new physics can be expressed in terms of three parameters slightly different from peskin - takeuchi ones : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "in addition one can define @xmath87 in order to describe the bottom quark sector as well @xcite .",
    "the advantage of those new parameters is that they are directly related to experiment and do not depend on the model , unlike the peskin - takeuchi ones , which are defined at a fixed point in the standard model . @xmath84 and @xmath86 are closely related to @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , while @xmath87 depends directly on the correction to the @xmath80 vertex , @xmath81 : @xmath88 the numerical values are those obtained by computing the sm corrections @xcite .",
    "@xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the contributions from the new physics to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath81 coming from the new heavy states . in that sense",
    "they are ultraviolet corrections . @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the infrared corrections coming from the effective mass of the higgs as in equ .",
    "( [ equ : mheff ] ) .",
    "they are given by @xcite : @xmath94    experimentally , the @xmath15 s are given by the lep experiment @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath47 is the correlation matrix of the four @xmath15 s .",
    "[ fig : e1e3 ] shows the relation between the experimental constraints and the predictions of our model , compared to the sm .",
    "the new physics corrections @xmath89 and @xmath91 can be computed explicitly at one loop as a function of the four free parameters of the model .",
    "since the top has three composite partners which have the same electric charge , the complete computation requires the diagonalisation of a @xmath96 mass matrix .",
    "one way to proceed analytically is to expand @xmath89 and @xmath91 as a power series in @xmath15 . at leading order",
    "we recover the sm top loop corrections , since for @xmath15 very small all the new states are really heavy and decouple : @xmath97 at next - to - leading order in @xmath15 , the new physics contributions are in a complicated form , but one can estimate their importance by taking appropriate limits . for @xmath98 ,",

    "notice however that in that very paper the realisation of the model is different from ours , in particular the global @xmath9 symmetry of the composite sector is not preserved .",
    "the analytical results ( [ equ : tt ] ) to ( [ equ : tauqx ] ) show basically that the singlet @xmath40 gives positive contributions to both @xmath89 and @xmath91 , whereas the doublets @xmath41 and @xmath43 give negative ones",
    ". hence one should expect @xmath40 to be lighter than the doublets mass scale @xmath54 in order to obtain the desired positive contribution @xmath89 .",
    "however , the similitude of equations ( [ equ : tt ] ) and ( [ equ : taut ] ) shows that a large @xmath89 comes together with a large @xmath91 , but the latter is strongly restricted by the experimental data .",
    "therefore the allowed region of the parameter space may well be very thin .    indeed , performing an exact numerical computation",
    ", one can see that there is no possibility to obtain a significant positive contribution to @xmath10 and simultaneously to protect @xmath81 from growing too large .",
    "this statement is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : dtdtau ] . however , it is still possible to get in agreement with the experimental precision measurements by having a small positive contribution to both @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this is because the bounds on @xmath87 are weaker than those on @xmath111 , since the correlation between the @xmath15 s given in equ .",
    "( [ equ : epsilons ] ) is smaller for @xmath87 .",
    "for example , with @xmath112  gev or equivalently @xmath113 , the model is excluded at about @xmath114 if there are no contributions to @xmath10 and @xmath81 from new physics ; however , a positive correction to both of them can drive the @xmath15 s into the @xmath115 confidence interval , as illustrated on the right - hand side of fig .  [",
    "fig : dtdtau ] .",
    "this precise computation of the electroweak precision observables was not performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and thus their conclusion was that positive contribution to both @xmath116 and @xmath91 have to be excluded , whereas we have shown quantitatively that it can improve largely the agreement with experimental data .",
    "notice that c.  anastasiou et  al .  obtain similar numerical results @xcite .",
    "there are two ways of achieving this agreement , very different one from another .",
    "the first is simply to have a singlet @xmath40 much lighter than the rest of the composite sector : this occurs in the case of the cancellation @xmath117 , which yields @xmath118 .",
    "notice that in this case @xmath54 can not be arbitrarily large since one should require @xmath119 in order to be able to perform perturbative computations . on the other hand",
    ", the singlet should not be too light , due to the lack of direct experimental observation .",
    "for example , with @xmath112  gev and @xmath120 , a numerical computation shows that the singlet mass can run roughly between 500  gev and 1  tev , whereas the rest of the spectrum is situated in a mass range from 3 to 7  tev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] left ) . the cancellation @xmath117",
    "might be seen as a form of fine - tuning .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath54 is completely free in our model , and it is not unnatural to expect it to be of the same order of magnitude as the symmetry breaking scale @xmath5 .",
    "then since @xmath121 should be of order one , the cancellation can be achieved in a very natural way .",
    "the alternative to such a large hierarchy between the singlet @xmath40 and the rest of the composite fermions is to have a very composite top quark , i.e.  to fix the mixing angle @xmath52 defined in equ .",
    "( [ equ : phil ] ) so that @xmath122 . in this case",
    "the electroweak precision observables are in agreement with the experimental data even for a large @xmath123 ratio .",
    "the explanation for this fact is that the top yukawa , given by equ .",
    "( [ equ : topmass ] ) to be @xmath124 , is fixed to the sm value ( roughly one ) , and therefore @xmath125 has to be smaller than one to compensate @xmath122 and @xmath126 ; but from equ .",
    "( [ equ : tt]-[equ : taut ] ) one can see that a small @xmath125 makes the contribution from the singlet dominant even if the doublet is light as well .",
    "an example of the corresponding physical masses is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] right for @xmath127 : the doublet @xmath43 is very light , below 500  gev , and the doublet @xmath41 and the singlet @xmath40 have a heavier mass , between 1 and 3  tev .",
    "the existence of those two regimes is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : epsmax ] left , where we see that a large @xmath63 is allowed mainly in two regions : one for @xmath128 , and one for @xmath122 .",
    "it shows also that with an appropriate choice of the parameters , one can have @xmath63 to be as large as 0.35 ( which corresponds to @xmath129  gev ) and still agree with the electroweak precision constraints at 99%  c.l . to have a better agreement with the experiment , however",
    ", the new physics should appear at a higher scale .",
    "[ fig : epsmax ] right shows the correlation between @xmath130 and the ratio @xmath123 . for 500  gev  @xmath131  tev ,",
    "roughly any physical spectrum can be obtained since the ratio @xmath123 is not constrained anymore , but still a heavy singlet requires a large @xmath130 . for @xmath132  tev , there is no real need for a positive contribution to @xmath89 and we are back to the trivial case where all the new fermions are so heavy that they do not affect the ewpt at all .",
    "notice however that the large-@xmath130 regime is problematic for flavour physics .",
    "for example , the mass difference @xmath133 of the neutral @xmath134 mesons is affected by the left - handed top compositeness .",
    "requiring @xmath133 to be within the 20% interval given by the experiment , one has roughly @xcite : @xmath135 from this constraint , @xmath102 can not be larger than 0.3 for @xmath112  gev . @xmath102 may actually affect the flavour physics in general , and therefore one should choose it as small as possible .",
    "the regime where the top is fully composite is therefore not realistic and should be excluded .",
    "another strong constraint is coming from the @xmath136 mixing , since the corrections to the @xmath137 operators is directly related to the correction to @xmath138 , as mentionned by barbieri et  al .",
    "@xcite in our case however the size of the positive contribution to @xmath138 is still reasonable , and does not give rise to a significant constraint .    since @xmath139 is a measure of the fine - tuning of the model , it should not be much smaller than 10% , i.e.  @xmath5 should not be significantly larger than 800  gev . since the top mass is directly proportional to @xmath15 , @xmath102 and @xmath140 from equation  ( [ equ : topmass ] ) , the scale of the new physics becomes very large if all those parameters are small .",
    "therefore one expects @xmath140 to be of order one , which yields a fully composite right - handed top quark .",
    "the characteristic signature of this class of composite models at lhc may come from the charge @xmath141 fermion , by single or pair production depending on its mass @xcite .",
    "in any case , the discovery is made possible only if the charge @xmath141 quark has a mass roughly below 2  tev .",
    "the future improvements to the precision electroweak observables might change the results depicted in this paper .",
    "in particular if the present values are confirmed and the precision is improved , the regions of the parameter space away by 2 or 3 sigma from the preferred value might be excluded .",
    "however , it is important to note that the present data are nearly one sigma away from the standard model prediction , and therefore a composite higgs model with @xmath142 is just as good as the standard model according to the ewpt .",
    "we have computed quantitatively the corrections at one loop to the peskin - takeuchi precision parameters @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and to the vertex of @xmath80 in the framework of a simple 4d two - site model @xcite based on a 5d composite higgs models @xcite .",
    "this class of models has to face important issues concerning the epwt : the reduction of the coupling of the higgs to the sm gauge fields leads to infrared corrections which affect the peskin - takeuchi @xmath11 and @xmath10 parameters , or similarly @xmath84 and @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , a large ultraviolet correction due to the presence of a composite vector resonance is pulling this model outside the @xmath115 confidence level .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that in our particular model the constraints from the ewpt can be obtained within @xmath143 and @xmath144  c.l .  without a large amount of fine - tuning .",
    "more precisely , @xmath63 could be as large as 0.5 provided that @xmath145 , i.e.  the left - handed top is fully composite . in this case",
    ", the new composite fermions would be at a mass scale accessible to the lhc .",
    "in particular the heavy charge @xmath45 quark should be produced significantly and give a characteristic signature of the model .",
    "but the full compositeness of the top quark is problematic for the flavour physics , so a full composite left - handed top is not realistic .",
    "the alternative is a regime where @xmath146 , which requires a cancellation between the bare mass of the @xmath9 fermion @xmath54 and the yukawa - like coupling @xmath147 .",
    "the latter option forces the composite doublets to be heavier than 3  tev , but it yields a light singlet whose mass is below 1  tev and can be nearly as light as the sm top quark .",
    "these requirements are relaxed when @xmath63 gets smaller . in summary ,",
    "the ewpt do not rule out this particular model , but give strong bounds on the parameter space and on the corresponding physical spectrum of states .",
