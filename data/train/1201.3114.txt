    "since ancient times , the art of encrypting messages using ciphers or breaking into them , has decided the destiny of the civilization . throughout the history , in many situations ,",
    "cryptography was directly responsible for the fortune or doom of kings and queens .",
    "the success of exchanging secret messages decided the future of many battles and even wars .",
    "some of them were important and very famous , such as the thermopiles battle ( greece - 490 bc ) , where according to the legend , the spartans were notified of the persian invasion by a crypto message hidden in earthenware , which enabled the spartans to plan a defense strategy before the persian attack .",
    "although the secret of the information plays an essential role in military strategy , it was only during the xx century wars that its real importance become obvious and popular . with the advent of radio , it was possible to exchange vital strategy information by electromagnetic waves . since there are no boundaries for radio waves , the cryptography power appeared as a fundamental strategy element .",
    "it is responsible for ensuring that the enemy , although being able to receive the message , is not capable of understanding it .",
    "in fact , cryptography was decisive in the destiny of the first and second world war .",
    "although cryptography is an important military and political information tool , these uses overcame the war times . in the digital ages",
    ", cryptography ensures security of business and bank transactions over the internet , and it can also ensure privacy of private messages , making the modern computer , the internet and wireless networks secure and usable technologies .",
    "the objective of cryptography consists of encrypting a message , file , document or image . to understand this procedure ,",
    "consider the following definitions .",
    "one thinks of the object to be encrypted as a string ( vector ) of size @xmath0 .",
    "the components of this vector is transformed to decimal ascii representation ( integers ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) forming the _ plaintext _ , which is represented by @xmath3 , with size @xmath0 .",
    "also , one needs a _ password _ string , which is transformed to decimal @xmath4 representation forming @xmath5 , with size @xmath6 .",
    "the plaintext @xmath3 is transformed into the ciphertext @xmath7 via an _ encode function _ @xmath8 , which is parametrized by the password @xmath5 . to retrieve the plaintext from the cipher , one uses the _",
    "decode function _",
    "@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the inverse of the encode function and parametrized by @xmath5 .",
    "perhaps the simplest encode function is the monoalphabetic ( cesar ) cipher @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the length of our alphabet , @xmath13 is a component of @xmath3 and @xmath14 is the integer associated to the password .",
    "the associated decode function is : @xmath15 . here",
    ", we call attention to the reversibility property of the @xmath16 operation .",
    "care must be paid because the signal in one of the arguments of the @xmath16 operation is reversed , for instance , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the current cryptography methods are based on discrete mathematics ( symmetrical key )  @xcite and number theory ( asymmetrical key )  @xcite .",
    "these algorithms use elementary mathematical as ciphers and have to increase the computing complexity to ensure a secure crypto . taking this into account ,",
    "they carry out many bit - to - bit operations and permutation between neighboring elements , or they have to use very long keys ( asymmetrical algorithms - nowadays rsa algorithms , for instance , use keys varying between @xmath19 and @xmath20 bits ) to hide information .",
    "however , for both strategies , the increase in the computing complexity and the size of the keys only ensure that the cipher is secure for a certain time . the constant increase in computer power and the evolution of the cryptoanalyses algorithm",
    "have made it easy to break into .",
    "nowadays , although there are algorithms which are capable to breaking into this kind of ciphers , they take too long , making them impractical  @xcite . the increase in computational power",
    "makes algorithms based on elementary mathematics weak .",
    "one example is the des method  @xcite , which was popular and largely used in the past .",
    "however , the algorithm became too weak and is no longer in use nowadays .",
    "to make the ciphers more secure , some new mathematical methodologies have to be considered and consequently new cryptography approaches arise . in this context , the chaos theory and the complex dynamical systems appear as very attractive alternatives to develop cryptography methods  @xcite .",
    "chaotic systems have some characteristics that make them valuable for cryptography , such as : ( i ) complex numerical patterns , ( ii ) unpredictably for unknown initial conditions , ( iii ) strong dependence on the initial conditions , ( iv ) based on relatively simple equations and ( iv ) determinism .",
    "the cryptography algorithms based on chaos generally explore the symmetrical approach .",
    "cryptography algorithms using chaos appeared in the 90 s .",
    "the first ones shuffle continue time signals using chaos  @xcite and also digital signals  @xcite . at the end of the decade ,",
    "chaos cryptography applied to digital data was introduced . in 1998 , baptista  @xcite proposed the use of the logistic map as a pseudo random generator to make a cipher capable of dealing with bit sequences .",
    "the baptista s algorithm was improved by wong and collaborators  @xcite making it faster and more secure .",
    "the block cryptograph was incorporated in the logistic map in 2005 by xiang _",
    "@xcite as an enhancement of the previous methods",
    ". as far as we are aware , there are two proposals in the literature using the lorenz s attractor as basis of cryptography methods .",
    "the first one  @xcite was proposed in 1998 , but it is very simple and weak . in the second one",
    "@xcite , the lorenz s attractor is used to generate pseudo random numbers in the same sense as the logistic map based ciphers .    in this work a novel cryptography method based on the lorenz s attractor is introduced .",
    "the proposals of the algorithm are to be secure and fast , making it practical for general use . in cryptography theory ,",
    "the strongest cipher ( impossible to break ) is reached when the pad has the same length as the message ( otp - one - time pad cipher )  @xcite .",
    "we use the lorenz s attractor to compute a virtually infinite pad exploring the chaos .",
    "the complexity of the attractor and its determinism , makes it possible to compute chaotic and long number sequences .",
    "what makes the otp impossible to be broken in is the fact that one does not know the pad .",
    "for instance , if one uses a book to write a otp cipher , the cipher is decoded when the book is discovered .",
    "since we use the lorenz s attractor to compute a pad , although it is difficult , one can compute the lorenz s trajectory and discover the cipher pad . to make this task harder to perform",
    ", we have added an operation mode in chaos , which we call the chaotic operation mode .",
    "the chaotic operation mode is a technique , inspired by traditional cryptography ( operation mode  @xcite ) , which provides an iteration between the password , already coded message and chaotic system to make a complicated walk over the attractor .",
    "the presentation of this paper starts with a discussion and a description of the chaotic operation mode ( section  [ operation ] ) .",
    "the cryptographic algorithm is proposed in details in section  [ algorithm ] and the results are showed the section  [ results ] , illustrating the behavior of the proposed method . in section  [ conclusion ] , the paper ends with a discussion about the method .",
    "cipher - block algorithms are able to carry out bit - to - bit operations between the neighbors of the plaintext and the password .",
    "this approach has a disadvantage of making similar ciphertext sequences for similar blocks of the plaintext , consequently making a weak cipher .",
    "the operation mode was created to correct this fault , which main idea is to make the blocks independent .",
    "consequently , the ciphertext is encrypted combining the information of the password plus the previous plaintext sequence .",
    "it can ensure that similar blocks of the plaintext are codified as different ciphertext , making the cipher stronger .",
    "one of the most popular operation mode algorithms is cipher - block chaining ( cbc )  @xcite .",
    "each component of the plaintext @xmath3 , of size @xmath0 is _ xored _ with the previous ciphered element : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an arbitrary value used to encode the first component of @xmath7 that can also be used as an extra password .",
    "this value has an important role in the crypt process , since without it one can not decode the message .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is generated from the password and it is desirable to include an additional parameter which may be different for each user .",
    "the symbol @xmath24 represents the bitwise xor logical operation .",
    "we notice that the size of @xmath7 is @xmath25 and that the elements of @xmath3 and @xmath7 are integers ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath26 representing the decimal ascii code . here",
    ", the encode function @xmath27 represents any symmetrical cryptography algorithm  @xcite using password @xmath5 .",
    "the operation mode uses information from the previous coded sequence ( @xmath28 ) to code @xmath29 to ensure that similar sequences in @xmath3 do not have the same sequences in @xmath7 .",
    "the inverse process also combines previous coded sequence to decode : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the decode function .",
    "we observe that encryption and decryption operation can carried out by the same procedure due to the reversible property of the bitwise xor logical operator . to illustrate the reversibility property , consider two bit sequences @xmath3 and @xmath5 and the resulting bit sequence @xmath32 .",
    "one then has @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "there are other operators that allow the reverse operation , for instance , as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath35 combined with a sign inversion in the argument .",
    "one interesting cryptographic scheme uses cellular automata  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the cellular automata must be reversible to preserve the information of the initial states  @xcite . for a cellular automaton to be reversible",
    ", the global function must be bijective to have an inverse .",
    "local functions that involve only bitwise xor logic operation lead to a linear global function , therefore , a bijective function ( with non - singular transition matrix )  @xcite .",
    "since the preserved patterns of the plaintext in the ciphertext may give clues for cipher analysis and the cipherblock chain is not strong enough , here , we propose to use dynamical systems in the chaotic regime to accomplish this task .",
    "we call this procedure of chaotic operation mode .",
    "the chaotic operation mode has the same basis of the traditional operation mode .",
    "the message , password and previous code are combined to achieve a strong cryptography not preserving repetitive patterns of the original message .",
    "while the operation mode combines the message and the previous coded message using elementary operations , the chaotic operation mode uses a chaotic system to compute this combination .",
    "this approach improves the cryptography , making the analysis of it more difficult .    in the following ,",
    "we show how to use a dynamical system in cryptography .",
    "firstly consider @xmath36 vectors @xmath37 , with initial condition @xmath38 .",
    "notice that @xmath37 is a vector , where each component represents a variable of the lorenz attractor so that it is a three dimensional vector .",
    "each vector is obtained by the iteration : @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 is a given vectorial function of a vector @xmath41 which represents the dynamical system .",
    "the components of the vectorial function @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , transforms the argument @xmath13 ( an integer between 0 and 255 ) depending on the iteration step .",
    "notice that the plaintext characters alter step by step the iteration process , which in a parameter region of chaos gives rise to the chaotic operation mode .",
    "the elements of the ciphertext are obtained from : @xmath45 $ ] , which encrypts the scalar @xmath13 , using bit - to - bit operations with bits extracted from the vectors @xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath46 extracts a value from the vector @xmath37 of the dynamic system .",
    "the decode process is simply achieved with the inverse operation : @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "recently a security fault in the logistic map based algorithm that could be extended to other chaos system was demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the return of the map that can be explored to break into the cipher .",
    "the chaotic operation mode solves this security fault of the chaos based cryptography algorithms , since it combines the password and plaintext with the chaos system , making it more secure .    when using the chaotic operation mode we call attention to the fact that if a message is altered we are able to detect it .",
    "in this way we guarantee its authentication . besides",
    ", we can also guarantee the integrity of cipher .",
    "the chaotic operation mode can guarantee the authentication because a minimal change in @xmath29 leads to a huge modification in the lorenz s path , that can be easy identified , assuring integrity and consequently its authenticity .",
    "we propose a full method that combines the dynamic system @xmath40 with the encode function @xmath27 . in our case , the dynamical system is the lorenz s attractor that generates a trajectory which is combined with the message , password with the chaotic operation mode .",
    "we start defining the quantities used in the algorithm and then we carefully describe it .",
    "the proposed algorithm uses the euler differential discretization method to numerically compute the lorenz s equation system ( other numerical methods could be considered ) @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and : @xmath50 \\delta t \\\\",

    "the number of iterations @xmath55 , along the lorenz s attractor , determines the speed of the processing of the algorithm .",
    "here we have used @xmath56 .",
    "the password @xmath5 is converted to decimal ascii values , with size @xmath6 .",
    "notice that @xmath6 has a limit , this is because of the representation of a real number in double precision in a given computer .",
    "the quantity @xmath57 , according to the ieee754 convention , is the number of bits of the mantissa to represent a double precision number .",
    "the first stage of the algorithm is devoted to the conversion of the password into a coordinate of the lorenz s attractor space .",

    "new ciphers are always appearing and new cryptoanalysis methods emerging to break into them ( the red queen effect ) . as a result , it is hard to predict , how difficult it is to break into a cipher .",
    "nevertheless , there are some metrics that can help the analysis and can estimate how much the cipher makes the ciphertext shuffled and unintelligible , allowing for a supposition about how strong the cipher is .    in the following ,",
    "two experiments with the proposed algorithm are presented .",
    "firstly , the algorithm encrypts a text message and an image .",
    "the analysis of the shuffled capability of the method is presented . besides the security",
    ", the computer performance is another important point for a cipher to be able to be used in real world applications .",
    "secondly , the results of the performance for the two versions of the sequential and parallel algorithm are presented .",
    "the results are compared with a popular aes method , which is used commercially nowadays .    when a ciphertext is yielded , several analysis estimating the strength of the cryptography are made . in the text experiment ,",
    "the book `` the return of sherlock holmes '' was encrypted .",
    "long texts , such as books , are easier to be broken into when compared with short messages since statistical patterns may be explored .",
    "one of the most well known methods of cryptoanalysis is the frequency analysis .",
    "it is quite simple and consists of carrying out a histogram , which presents the ascii characters frequency , giving tips about their frequency pattern for the cryptoanalysis .",
    "the frequency analysis is carried out and displayed in figure  [ book_histogram ] .",
    "it illustrates the histogram of the considered book , comparing the plaintext ( figure  [ book_histogram ] ( a ) ) with the ciphertext ( figure  [ book_histogram ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "notice that , the distribution is almost constant in the ciphertext , like a white noise , which illustrates a good performance for the crypto .",
    "figures  [ book_histogram ] ( b ) and ( c ) present the book s histogram encrypted with two slightly different passwords:``123456 '' and  123457. the two histograms have different plots , illustrating the way the cryptography result depends on the password .",
    "+ ( a ) +   + ( b ) +   + ( c )     ( a ) + ( b ) ( c )    the shannon s entropy is another approach to estimates how unintelligible the ciphertext is .",
    "for a eight bit codification the text entropy is @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the relative frequency of the @xmath139-th ascii character .",

    "the entropy achieved by the cryptography is the same as the theoretical prediction for the system .",
    "this result shows that the ciphertext has a very low level of redundancy or predictability .    in figure  [ book_correlation ] auto - correlation matrices",

    "images are also appropriate to cryptoanalysis , as , they have strong global and local patterns and redundancy .",
    "the experiment is to compare three images : the original one , the cipher - image and white noise image .",
    "the frequency analysis has been performed and compared it to 2d fourier power spectrum of the images ( see figure  [ image ] ) .",
    "notice that while the original image histogram has a lot of information concerning the image and both the cipher image and noise histograms are similar .",
    "this fact shows how unintelligible the encrypted image is . unlike the spectrum of the original image",
    ", the spectrum of the noise and the cipher - image does not present any frequency information , which demonstrates that the information can not be achieved in the cipher - image .",
    "performance is the most important obstacle that prevents practical use of chaos based cryptography algorithms .",
    "in fact , they need float point and numerous calculations , which make the chaos cryptography programs much slower than the traditional ones . to make the proposed algorithm feasible ,",
    "we have improved its performance using parallel computation , which is in current use nowadays via the increase of multiple cores in the computer processor or with the use of graphical cards with multiple gpus ( graphical processing unit ) .",
    "the nature of our algorithm allows an intuitive parallelization .",
    "consider a message of size @xmath143 and a machine with @xmath144 processors .",

    "the computer performance of the cryptography algorithm is an important item to make it feasible for real applications .",
    "the algorithm has been implemented in java and also in c ( fast version ) .",
    "the choice of java was made due to its portability and capability to run on multiple operational systems and computer hardware ( also small devices such as mobile phones ) .",
    "two versions of the algorithm have been implemented : the full proposed method as described in section  [ algorithm ] and its parallel version described above . in the parallel version ,",
    "the chaotic operation mode has been adapted to make the algorithm easy to be parallelized .",
    "this version is weaker than the original version , but it is faster and also highly parallelized .",
    "there is also a performance comparison of this implementation with the popular aes cryptography method  @xcite shown in figure  [ performance_graphs ] .",
    "figure  [ performance_graphs]a shows the plot of the time consumption versus the size of the file encrypted for the sequential strong version .",
    "the machine used was a pentium 4 - 3.40 ghz , with 3 gb of memory and which runs gentoo linux distribution and a intel quadcore q8200 with 4 gb of memory and which runs debian linux 5.0 distribution .",
    "the algorithm has an average of rate of approximately 1.5 mb / min .",
    "note that the program was implemented in java and can achieve a performance of 3 or 4 times faster if it is built using the c language .",
    "although , this performance is very slow , it can be considered usable for high security purpose tasks .    to improve the performance of the algorithm , a simpler ( but still strong ) ,",
    "fast and parallel version has been developed ( subsection  [ fast ] ) .",
    "the fast parallel version was implemented in c and , to explore mass computer parallelism , the gpu ( graphics processing unit ) architecture was adopted ( 8800 gt graphical card ) and the cuda ( www.nvidia.com ) , a gpu programming tool for c , was used .",
    "figure  [ performance_graphs]b presents the performance of the program compared with the aes . both programs run on the same computer ( described previously ) .",
    "the performance of the chaos based algorithm , which is approximately ( approximate 2.5 mb / s in a nvidia geforce 8800gt and approximate 4.3",
    "mb / s in a nvidia gtx 285 ) is close to the aes ( approximate 8.3 mb / s in a intel pentium 4 3.4 ghz and approximate 18 mb / s in a intel quadcore q8200 ) .",
    "the great performance of the fast and parallel implementation allows immediate use of the chaos cryptography algorithm in real life applications , which has an advantage of being more secure then the traditional cryptography approach .",
    "in this paper , a new cryptograph algorithm based on the lorenz s attractor and a novel method to carry out the operation mode with chaos ( chaotic operation mode ) were proposed . the proposed algorithm in combination with the chaotic operation mode achieves a strong cipher .",
    "the novel method has been implemented in java ( sequential strong version ) and also in cuda ( parallel fast version ) and experiments present the performance of cryptography and as well as the time of the algorithm has been presented and discussed .",
    "the performance of the method and the comparison with the aes algorithms demonstrate that the method is suitable and prepared for real life applications .",
    "the analysis of the algorithm and of the results , we notice that the algorithm is strong and perhaps very difficult to break into .",
    "however , it is very difficult to determine in fact , how hard t is to break into a cipher . besides the set of experiments conducted and presented , a web version of the algorithm has been implemented .",
    "we would like to invite crypto - analysts to try to break into the proposed cipher , and help us to determine the reliability of the method and of course , to help develop of new methods .",
