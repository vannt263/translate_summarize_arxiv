    "preconditioned inverse iteration evolved in recent years into a very popular method for the solution of the large matrix eigenvalue problems that arise from the discretization of linear selfadjoint elliptic partial differential equations , in particular in form of the locally optimal ( block-)preconditioned conjugate gradient method @xcite .",
    "the analysis of such methods essentially started with the work of dyakonov and orekhov  @xcite from the early 1980 s . in a series of groundbreaking papers ,",
    "neymeyr @xcite and knyazev and neymeyr @xcite analyzed these methods in great detail and determined the exact convergence rate of their basic variant .",
    "the resulting estimates are short and elegant , but their proof is by no means simple and requires a long , complicated , and tedious analysis .",
    "their generalization to the infinite dimensional case is anything but obvious and necessitates additional considerations  @xcite , in particular in the presence of an essential spectrum as in the example of the electronic schrdinger equation , a basic equation of quantum physics and chemistry .",
    "therefore we adapt in this little note the original , comparatively simple and short proof of dyakonov and orekhov @xcite to this general situation and derive , in the language of quantum mechanics , a variant for the calculation of the ground state energy , the minimum eigenvalue , and an associated eigenfunction .",
    "the price to be paid is that the initial approximation of this eigenfunction , from which the iterative process starts , must already possess a rayleigh quotient below the rest of the spectrum and that the derived error bounds are surely not best possible .",
    "they show , however , qualitatively the right behavior , that is , they depend like the best possible bounds for the matrix case only on the minimum eigenvalue and its distance to the rest of the spectrum and on a constant that controls the accuracy of the approximate solutions of the equation that links the iterates . our presentation is completely based on the weak form of the eigenvalue problem and refers to it only via the assigned bilinear forms .",
    "let @xmath0 be a hilbert space that is equipped with the inner product @xmath1 inducing the energy norm @xmath2 , under which it is complete , and a further inner product @xmath3 that induces the weaker norm @xmath4 .",
    "let the infimum of the rayleigh quotient @xmath5 be an isolated eigenvalue @xmath6 of finite multiplicity , which means in particular that the norm @xmath4 of an element @xmath7 can be estimated by its energy norm @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the corresponding eigenspace , the finite dimensional space of all @xmath7 for which @xmath9 or equivalently @xmath10 holds . our primary aim is the calculation of this eigenvalue , in quantum mechanics the ground state energy of the system under consideration , and to a lesser degree also of an eigenvector for this eigenvalue .",
    "as @xmath11 for all @xmath12 and as @xmath13 , the orthogonal complement @xmath14 of @xmath8 with respect to the inner product @xmath3 is at the same time the @xmath15-orthogonal complement of this eigenspace .",
    "let @xmath16 be the infimum of the rayleigh quotient on @xmath17 , itself a point in the spectrum . since @xmath18 is an isolated eigenvalue , @xmath19 . in most cases , @xmath16 will also be an isolated eigenvalue , even in the presence of an essential spectrum as in the example of the electronic schrdinger equation , but neither this nor any other additional assumption on the structure of the spectrum will enter into our argumentation .    given an element @xmath7  with norm @xmath20 and rayleigh quotient @xmath21 , in inverse iteration in its original , exact version at first the solution @xmath22 of the equation @xmath23 is determined , which exists by the lax - milgram or the riesz representation theorem and is unique .",
    "the current @xmath24 is then replaced by @xmath25 . since @xmath26",
    ", @xmath27 the new element @xmath25 is thus different from zero so that @xmath28 is well defined and the process can be repeated with the normed version of @xmath25 .",
    "the in this way iteratively generated sequence of rayleigh quotients decreases then monotonously to the eigenvalue @xmath18 and the iterates @xmath24 converge to an eigenvector for this eigenvalue .",
    "this process can hardly be realized when @xmath0 is infinite dimensional or of high finite dimension . in the modification considered in this note , the solution @xmath29 of equation ( [ eq2.4 ] ) is therefore replaced by an approximation @xmath30 for which an error estimate @xmath31 holds , where @xmath32 is a fixed constant that controls the accuracy . by ( [ eq2.5 ] ) and ( [ eq2.6 ] ) @xmath33 so that also @xmath34 and the whole process can proceed with the new iterate @xmath35 we do not make any assumption on the origin of @xmath30 .",
    "it can , for example , be the element of best approximation of @xmath29 in an appropriately chosen finite dimensional subspace of  @xmath0 , an iteratively calculated approximation of this element , or anything else .",
    "we will analyze in the next section the convergence properties of this general form of approximate inverse iteration along the lines given by dyakonov and orekhov .",
    "starting point of our analysis is as described an element @xmath7 of norm @xmath20 with rayleigh quotient @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 is the unique solution of equation ( [ eq2.4 ] ) , @xmath30  an approximation of this @xmath29 satisfying ( [ eq2.6 ] ) , and @xmath36 the normed version ( [ eq2.8 ] ) of @xmath37 . for abbreviation , we set @xmath38 and @xmath39 . moreover , we need the @xmath15-orthogonal projection @xmath40 of the hilbert space @xmath0 onto the eigenspace @xmath8 for the eigenvalue @xmath18 , which is at the same time the orthogonal projection of @xmath0 to @xmath8 with respect to the other inner product @xmath3 , and the with respect to both inner products orthogonal projection @xmath41 of @xmath0 onto the orthogonal complement ( [ eq2.3 ] ) of @xmath8 .      for @xmath43 ,",
    "let @xmath44 be the solution of the equation @xmath45 the element @xmath46 is then the solution of the equation ( [ eq2.4 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath47 as @xmath48 and @xmath49 are in @xmath17 and @xmath50 is orthogonal with respect to both inner products , @xmath51 therefore @xmath52 . as @xmath53 ,",
    "this yields @xmath54 as @xmath55 and @xmath48 are orthogonal to each other and @xmath20 , @xmath56 from which the estimate ( [ eq3.1 ] ) finally follows .      as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and because @xmath29 is a solution of equation ( [ eq2.4 ] ) , @xmath62 estimating the denominator with help of the assumption ( [ eq2.6 ] ) on the accuracy of @xmath30 from below and the nominator using @xmath20 from above , one obtains the estimate @xmath63 the right hand side becomes , as a function of the norm @xmath64 , minimal if @xmath65 and attains then the value on the right hand side of ( [ eq3.2 ] ) .      the function @xmath70 is monotonously increasing . if one inserts the estimate ( [ eq3.1 ] ) into the estimate ( [ eq3.2 ] ) , one obtains therefore the lower bound @xmath71 for the difference @xmath72 of the two rayleigh quotients . if @xmath73 , the representation @xmath74 of @xmath75 thus yields the estimate ( [ eq3.3 ] ) . the function @xmath67 possesses the derivative @xmath76 and is therefore strictly increasing on the interval under consideration .",
    "if @xmath77 and @xmath24 is therefore an eigenvector for the eigenvalue  @xmath18 , @xmath78 and thus also @xmath79 . the iteration comes then to a halt , it is @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and ( [ eq3.3 ] ) trivially holds .",
    "[ lm3.4 ] if already @xmath87 , the distance of the normed version @xmath36 of the new vector @xmath37 and the given normed @xmath24 satisfies an estimate @xmath88 with a constant depending only on @xmath89 and the ratio @xmath90    because @xmath24 has the norm @xmath20 , the energy norm of @xmath91 can be written as @xmath92 the triangle inequality leads therefore to the estimate @xmath93 or , because of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , to @xmath97 estimating the norm of @xmath30 by ( [ eq3.5 ] ) in terms of @xmath98 , the proposition follows .",
    "if one starts therefore with a normed initial approximation @xmath99 in @xmath0 with rayleigh quotient @xmath100 and generates in the manner described a sequence of normed  @xmath101 , the rayleigh quotients @xmath102 decrease strictly to the minimum eigenvalue @xmath18 or become stationary there and the estimate @xmath103 holds . as @xmath104 , @xmath105 so that the rayleigh quotients converge because of @xmath106 rapidly to their limit .",
    "when @xmath107 goes to infinity , the error reduction factors @xmath108 fall to @xmath109 a value less surprisingly worse than the optimal limit value @xmath110 that knyazev and neymeyr @xcite obtain for the matrix case . for sufficiently large @xmath107 , when the norms of the assigned @xmath111 are already sufficiently small , by lemma  [ lm3.4",
    "] @xmath112 holds with some constant @xmath113 that depends only on @xmath89 and the ratio @xmath90 . in view of the error estimate ( [ eq3.8 ] ) for the rayleigh quotients ,",
    "the @xmath101 thus form a cauchy sequence in the hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "they converge therefore to a limit @xmath114 of norm @xmath115 .",
    "our final theorem shows that the distance of an arbitrary normed @xmath24 with rayleigh quotient less than @xmath16 to its best approximation by an element in the eigenspace @xmath8 can be bounded in terms of the distance of its rayleigh quotient to the eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "let again @xmath38 for abbreviation .",
    "the proof is based on the relation @xmath117 using @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and moreover that @xmath120 one obtains from this relation the lower estimate @xmath121 for @xmath55 . since @xmath122 , this proves the estimate ( [ eq3.12 ] ) .",
