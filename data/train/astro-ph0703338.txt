    "the density - morphology relation @xcite , indicating an increasing elliptical and s0 population fraction with increasing density , has been known to exist over six orders of magnitude in galaxy density @xcite .",
    "it is only recently that large surveys have shown just how smoothly the galaxy properties change with galaxy density .",
    "for example @xcite find that gas deficiency gradually decreases out to two abell radii from the cluster center and @xcite and @xcite find that the star formation rate depends on local galaxy density .",
    "these results have led to the concept that galaxies may already be affected by their environment well before they fall into the dense cluster core ( _ pre - processing _ ) .    while many processes have been suggested to affect galaxies in the cluster environment such as ram - pressure stripping @xcite , starvation @xcite , harassment @xcite and tidal distortions due to the cluster potential and galaxy - galaxy interactions @xcite , it is still an open question what would affect the galaxies in the lower density outskirts of the clusters .",
    "recently @xcite studied one such case , ngc  4522 , which is at a large projected distance from the center of virgo , yet appears to be undergoing ram - pressure stripping due to bulk motions of the icm , as the m49 subcluster is merging with virgo proper .    in our new vla hi survey of the virgo cluster , we find candidates that appear to be feeling the cluster influence for the first time in the outskirts of the cluster . a number of galaxies located at intermediate distances from m87 reveal long gas tails , all pointing roughly away from the cluster center . here",
    "we test our assumption that these tail galaxies are recent arrivals in the cluster and review possible causes of their gas tails , i.e. how galaxies can be modified before they enter the dense cluster core .",
    "viva , vlaimaging of virgo galaxies in atomic gas , is a new vla hi survey of spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "the goal of the survey is to study details of different environmental effects .",
    "the virgo cluster is ideal for this study not only due to its nearness but also because it is dynamically young @xcite and very likely to contain various mechanisms at work .",
    "we have sampled @xmath150 galaxies throughout the cluster from near the dense core to the outskirts .",
    "the selected galaxies are located at projected distances of 0.3 - 3.3 mpc from the cluster center assuming a distance of 16  mpc to virgo @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath2 - 4.3 virial radii @xcite .",
    "the new survey was done with the vla in the c - short array and additional 10 fields ( 13 galaxies ) previously observed in c array were also included in the database .",
    "the typical spatial and spectral resolutions are 15@xmath3 and 10 km  s@xmath4 , respectively , which are a factor of 3 and 4 better than the previous vla hi survey of virgo spirals @xcite .",
    "the rms of the data is typically 0.4 mjy , yielding an hi column density sensitivity of @xmath5 @xmath6 in 3@xmath7 .",
    "the data have been calibrated and continuum subtracted with the astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the data from the nrao archive have been processed in the same way as the new survey data . to maximize the sensitivity",
    ", we applied a weighting scheme intermediate between uniform and natural but somewhat closer to a natural weighting scheme ( robust=1 , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "these tail galaxies have the following properties in common in the hi morphology : 1 ) the hi is extended well beyond the optical disk only on one side ; 2 ) the tails differ from tidal bridges , i.e. there is no optical counterpart at the tip of the tail down to @xmath15 mag  arcsec@xmath16 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images for extended features like the tails ; 3 ) the projected length of the tail is larger than the half of the symmetric part in hi ( @xmath17 ; see table 1 ) .    besides the similarities in gas morphology , the tails are also pointing roughly away from m87 as shown with arrows in plate 1 .",
    "these hi tail galaxies are located at intermediate distances of @xmath0 mpc from m87 in projection .",
    "all but ngc  4654 are found to the west of m87 , where the x - ray emission appears to be more elongated .",

    "the tail is clearly detected out to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 kpc ) , although there is a hint of faint gas even further to the sw in the direction of m49 , which itself is the center of a subcluster of galaxies ( plate 1 ) .",

    "the tail galaxies are located at intermediate distances from the cluster center at a projected distance of 0.6 - 1  mpc from m87 .",
    "the length and the width of the tails vary , but the tails are all pointing roughly away from the cluster center ( m87 ) , suggesting that a single global mechanism such as the cluster potential or ram - pressure due to the icm might be responsible for these hi tails .",
    "the cluster potential however , is not enough to affect galaxies significantly at those distances .",
    "the tidal acceleration due to the cluster potential ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitional constant , @xmath36 is the cluster mass within a radius @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the size of the galaxy ) is typically @xmath12  ( km  s@xmath4)@xmath39  kpc@xmath4 while the gravitational acceleration of the galaxy ( @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the galaxy s rotational velocity ) is always larger than the cluster potential by 3 orders of magnitude , with a typical value of @xmath42  ( km  s@xmath4)@xmath39  kpc@xmath4 .    alternatively galaxies can be gas stripped by ram - pressure when @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the icm density , @xmath45 is the galaxy s velocity @xmath46 the icm , and @xmath47 is the ism surface density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also voller 2001 ) . in figure  2",
    "we compare the estimated ram - pressure strength with the restoring force per unit area in the disk of each galaxy . rather than using the observed radial velocities , we use the simulations of @xcite to estimate the range of relative velocities a galaxy can have at a given projected distance from the cluster center ( 1250 to 1900  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the error bar in the ram - pressure indicates this range .",
    "the main uncertainty in the restoring force is the surface density of the gas at the time of stripping .",
    "we considered two extremes , the mean hi surface density in the tail , and the peak value measured in the tail .",
    "figure  2 shows that ram - pressure could exceed the restoring force for 5 out of 7 galaxies .    as seen in plate 1 ,",
    "ngc  4330 , ngc  4424 and ngc  4302 ( and its neigbour ngc  4298 ) clearly show that their hi disk is truncated to well within the stellar disk indicating that these three galaxies must have been affected by a gas - gas interaction .",
    "the systemic velocity of ngc  4330 and ngc  4302 is close to the cluster mean , indicating that they move mostly in the plane of the sky .",
    "this combined with the fact that their hi tails point away from the cluster center , suggests these galaxies are falling into the cluster along highly radial orbits .",
    "ngc  4424 , whose systemic velocity is highly blueshifted with respect to the cluster mean , could be falling in from the back .",
    "another possibility is that it has passed close to m49 and has been stripped by the icm of that subcluster .",
    "its tail points directly toward the subcluster . in this scenario",
    "the ngc  4424 tail would be more comparable to another tail in virgo recently found by @xcite , which appears to be gas stripped from ngc  4388 by the hot icm gas in the subgroup of m86 .",
    "similarly a passage close to m49 could have caused the gravitational disturbance of ngc  4424 , as m86 might have gravitationally disturbed ngc  4388 .    at the other extreme , the two galaxies for which our simple estimate of ram - pressure appears too low to have an effect",
    ", still show signs of gas - gas interaction . both galaxies ,",
    "ngc  4396 and ngc  4654 , have hi compressed on one side , while the hi tail at the opposite side does not seem to have an optical counterpart . in deeper optical images ,",
    "ngc  4654 reveals more stellar light beyond the hi disk to the nw (   3.2 ) .",
    "in fact @xcite concludes that the hi morphology and kinematics of ngc  4654 can best be explained by the combined effect of ram - pressure stripping and a tidal disturbance by its companion , ngc  4639 .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  4396 looks optically undisturbed .",
    "several explanations are possible , either the galaxy is affected by viscous turbulent stripping instead of the simple momentum transfer , or the icm pressure is enhanced due to bulk motions or local clumping of the gas , as it is likely in ngc  4522 ( kenney et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "additionally , the kinematics of the tails also support an icm - ism interaction for most cases . for all galaxies except ngc  4294 and possibly ngc  4330",
    ", the velocity gradient in the hi tails is toward the cluster mean ( fig . [ fig - tailxv ] ) as it is expected if the hi gas has been stripped by the cluster gas .    we have seen for ngc  4654 that the tidal interaction with a nearby companion could have made the galaxy more vulnerable to ram - pressure stripping .",
    "we may well ask whether tidal interactions with neighbors could help explain the existence of the other tails .",
    "@xcite shows that if galaxies fall in as groups , the effect of the cluster potential gets greatly enhanced . in table 1",
    "we list the nearest companion for each of the galaxies .",
    "almost all have neighbors that are close in projection ( @xmath48100  kpc ) and in velocity ( @xmath48100  km  s@xmath4 ) . in a dense cluster environment being close in projection",
    "does not necessarily imply physical association , on the other hand the cumulative effect of many distant encounters can also loosen the outer parts ( harassment ) .",
    "it is thus not unlikely that gravity plays some role , yet morphologically all the systems show some evidence for gas - gas interactions as well .",
    "the only exception is the ngc  4299/4294 pair , although a parallel orientation of two tidal tails is rarely seen in interacting systems , and the tails have no stellar counterparts down to the sdss limit",
    ". in analogy with the @xcite result tidal interactions may make it more easy to ram - pressure strip galaxies by bringing material to the outer disk @xcite .    to conclude , while previous hi imaging showed that highly hi deficient galaxies in the center of virgo have very small hi disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are now providing hi images of galaxies that are beyond the strongly hi deficient zone ( @xmath49mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig .  3 in solanes et al .",
    "our images show how galaxies just outside the virial radius may begin to lose their gas . in this region ( 0.6@xmath501  mpc from m87 ) ,",
    "seven of the 16 galaxies imaged by us ( out of 27 spiral galaxies in the vcc catalog with m@xmath5113.75 , binggeli , sandage & tammann 1985 ) show hi tails .",
    "thus at least 26% of the large spiral galaxies in this region of virgo seem to be recent arrivals being stripped of gas .",
    "interestingly , since it only affects the loosely bound gas in the outer parts of the galaxies , the simple momentum transfer ram - pressure picture still works for most of these galaxies , though viscous turbulent stripping , which can remove the gas more efficiently from edge - on encounters @xmath46 the icm @xcite , could affect some galaxies ( e.g. ngc  4302 ) .",
    "it seems then that galaxy pre - processing occurs through mild gas - gas and/or tidal interactions before the galaxies enter the dense part of the cluster .",
    "once they are within a virial radius gas gets removed within a gigayear through momentum transfer ram - pressure stripping of the more higly radially infalling galaxies and possibly viscous turbulent stripping of galaxies on more circular orbits .",
