    ".    however , it is worth pointing out that the requirement for opposite - side electrons leads to low efficiency for small opening angles , and thereby helps suppress one of the potential @xmath11-decay backgrounds , mller scattering ( see sec .",

    "although the dozen conversion electrons per hour emitted from the 1  pci @xmath30bi deposit in the center of the @xmath11-decay source is sufficient for day - to - day monitoring of detector performance , a stronger source was required temporarily for accurate energy resolution studies .",

    "low - momentum particles will create helical tracks of relatively small radius and low pitch . as the diameter of the helix approaches the @xmath17- and @xmath18-resolution of the tpc , the quality of the reconstruction diminishes .",
    "similarly , if the @xmath19-separation of adjacent cycles of the helix is less than the @xmath19-resolution of the tpc , the helix will not be resolved , and only a single , wide swath of ionization will be reconstructed .    although some sensitivity clearly remains for energies as low as the 57  kev @xmath30bi auger electron  @xcite , for this analysis a 250  kev energy threshold was imposed .",
    "the tpc does not reach optimum efficiency until somewhat higher energies , but in place of still higher energy cuts , which would sacrifice a significant amount of good data , a model of the detector response was determined and used in subsequent analyses .",
    "also included in the model is the high - energy response which is limited as well , because the pitch and radius of the track tend to increase with higher energies . at some point , the track becomes too straight for the fitter to determine reliable helix parameters .",

    "such a function would not be generally applicable , however , because its dependence on the energy derivatives can not be extracted from a single test spectrum .",
    "for this reason , it is useful to separate the detector effects into two classes  intrinsic and instrumental , and deal with the former by monte carlo .",
    "the intrinsic effects include scattering and energy loss of electrons within the @xmath11 source , and backscattering of electrons from the tpc walls .",
