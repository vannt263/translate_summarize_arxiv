    "the infrastructure , applications and protocols of the system of communicating computers and networks are constantly evolving .",
    "the traffic , which is an essence of the communication , presently is a voluminous data generated on minute - by - minute basis within multi - layered structure by different applications and according to different protocols . as a consequence , there are two general approaches in analysis of the traffic and in modeling of its healthy behavior . in the first approach , the traffic analysis considers the protocols , applications , traffic matrix and routing matrix estimates , independence of ingress and egress points and much more .",
    "the second approach treats the infrastructure between the points from which the traffic is obtained as a `` black box '' @xcite .",
    "measuring interactions between logically and architecturally equivalent substructures of the system is a natural extension of the `` black box '' approach .",
    "certain amount of work in this direction has already been done .",
    "studies on statistical traffic flow properties revealed the `` congested '' , `` fluid '' and `` transitional '' regimes of the flow at a large scale @xcite .",
    "the observed collective behavior suggests the existence of the large - scale network - wide correlations between the network subparts .",
    "indeed , the @xcite work showed the large - scale cross - correlations between different connections of the renater scientific network .",
    "moreover , the analysis of correlations across all simultaneous network - wide traffic has been used in network distributed attacks detection @xcite .",
    "the distributions and stability of established interactions statistics represent the characteristic features of the system and may be exploited in healthy network traffic profile creation , which is an essential part of network anomaly detection .",
    "as it is successfully demonstrated in @xcite , all tested traffic anomalies change the distribution of the traffic features .    among numerous types of traffic monitoring variables , time series of traffic counts",
    "are free of applications `` semantics '' and thus more preferable for `` black box '' analysis .",
    "to extract the meaningful information about underlying interactions contained in time series , the empirical correlation matrix is a usual tool at hand .",
    "in addition , there are various classes of statistical tools , such as principal component analysis , singular value decomposition , and factor analysis , which in turn strongly rely on the validity of the correlation matrix and obtain the meaningful part of the time series .",
    "thus , it is important to understand quantitatively the effect of noise , i.e. to separate the noisy , random interactions from meaningful ones .",
    "in addition , it is crucial to consider the finiteness of the time series in the determination of the empirical correlation , since the finite length of time series available to estimate cross correlations introduces `` measurement noise '' @xcite .",
    "statistically , it is also advisable to develop null - hypothesis tests in order to check the degree of statistical validity of the results obtained against cases of purely random interactions .",
    "the methodology of random matrix theory ( rmt ) developed for studying the complex energy levels of heavy nuclei and is given a detailed account in @xcite .",
    "for our purposes this methodology comes in as a series of statistical tests run on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of `` system matrix '' , which in our case is traffic time series cross - correlation matrix @xmath0 ( and is hamiltonian matrix in case of nuclei and other rmt systems @xcite ) .    in our study , we propose to investigate the network traffic as a complex system with a certain degree of mutual interactions of its constituents , i.e. single - link traffic time series , using the rmt approach .",
    "we concentrate on the large scale correlations between the time series generated by simple network manage protocol ( snmp ) traffic counters at every router - router and router - vlan subnet connection of university of louisville backbone routers system .",
    "the contributions of this study are as follows :    * we propose the application constraints free methodology of network - wide traffic time series interactions analysis .",
    "even though in this particular study , we know in advance that vlans represent separate broadcast domains , vlan - router incoming traffic is a traffic intended for other vlans and vlan - router outgoing traffic is a routed traffic from other vlans .",
    "nevertheless , this information is irrelevant for our analysis and acquired only at the interpretation of the analysis results . * using the rmt",
    ", we are able to separate the random interactions from system specific interactions .",
    "the vast majority of traffic time series interact in random fashion . the time stable random interactions signify the healthy , and free of congestion traffic .",
    "the proposed analysis of eigenvector distribution allows to verify the time series content of uncongested traffic . *",
    "the time stable non - random interactions provide us with information about large - scale system - specific interactions . *",
    "finally , the temporal changes in random and non - random interactions can be detected and allocated with eigenvalues and eigenvectors statistics of interactions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii presents the survey of related work .",
    "we describe the rmt methodology in section iii .",
    "section iv contains the explanation of the data analyzed . in section",
    "v we test the eigenvalue distribution of inter - vlan traffic time series cross - correlation matrix c against the rmt predictions . in section",
    "vi we analyze the content of inter - vlan traffic interactions by mean of eigenvalues and eigenvectors deviated from rmt .",
    "section vii discusses the characteristic traffic interactions parameters of the system such as time stability of the deviating eigenvalues and eigenvectors , inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) of eigenvalues spectra , localization points in ipr plot , overlap matrices of the deviating eigenvectors . with series of different experiments , we demonstrate how traffic interactions anomalies can be detected and allocated in time and space using various visualization techniques on eigenvalues and eigenvectors statistics in section viii .",
    "we present our conclusions and prospective research steps in section ix .",
    "few works investigate the interactions of traffic time series regardless of underlying architecture of the traffic system . as it was stated in introduction , the study of @xcite showed the large - scale cross - correlations between different connections of the french scientific network renater with 26 interconnected routers and 650 connections links .",
    "the random interactions between traffic time series of complex traffic system without the routing protocol information were established by krbalek and seba in @xcite for transportation system in cuernavaca ( mexico ) .    the urgent need for a network - wide , scalable approach to the problem of healthy network traffic profile creation",
    "is expressed in works of @xcite .",
    "there are several studies with the promising results , which demonstrate that the traffic anomalous events cause the temporal changes in statistical properties of traffic features .",
    "lakhina , crovella and diot presented the characterization of the network - wide anomalies of the traffic flows .",
    "the authors studied three different types of traffic flows and fused the information from flow measurements taken throughout the entire network .",
    "they obtained and classified a different set of anomalies for different traffic types using the subspace method @xcite .",
    "the same group of researchers extended their work in @xcite . under the new assumption that any network anomaly induces the changes in distributional aspects of packet header fields",
    ", they detected and identified large set of anomalies using the entropy measurement tool .",
    "hidden markov model has been proposed to model the distribution of network - wide traffic in @xcite .",
    "the observation window is used to distinguish denial of service ( dos ) flooding attack mixed with the normal background traffic .",
    "roughan et al . combined the entire network routing and traffic data to detect the ip forwarding anomalies @xcite .",
    "huang et al . ,",
    "@xcite used the distributed version of the principal component analysis ( pca ) method for centralized network - wide volume anomaly detection .",
    "a key ingredient of their framework is an analytical method based on stochastic matrix perturbation theory that balances between the accuracy of the approximate network anomaly detection and the amount of data communication over the network .",
    "the authors of @xcite found the high temporal correlation ( frequently > 0.99 ) between flow counts on quiescent ports ( tcp / ip ports which are not in regular use ) at the one of the known pre - attack , so called _ reconnaissance _ , anomalous behavior , vertical scan .",
    "the rmt was employed in the financial studies of stock correlations @xcite , communication theory of wireless systems @xcite , array signal processing @xcite , bioinformatics studies of protein folding @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any work , except for @xcite , where rmt techniques were applied to the internet traffic system .",
    "we adopt the methodology used in works on financial time series correlations ( see @xcite and references therein ) and later in @xcite , which discusses cross - correlations in internet traffic . in particular , we quantify correlations between @xmath2 traffic counts time series of @xmath3 time points , by calculating the traffic rate change of every time series @xmath4 @xmath5 , over a time scale @xmath6,@xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the traffic rate of time series @xmath9 .",
    "this measure is independent from the volume of the traffic exchange and allows capturing the subtle changes in the traffic rate @xcite .",
    "the normalized traffic rate change is    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the standard deviation of @xmath12 .",
    "the equal - time cross - correlation matrix @xmath0 can be computed as follows@xmath13 the properties of the traffic interactions matrix @xmath0 have to be compared with those of a random cross - correlation matrix @xcite . in matrix notation , the interaction matrix @xmath0 can be expressed as@xmath14 where @xmath15 is @xmath16 matrix with elements @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the transpose of @xmath15 . just as was done in @xcite , we consider a random correlation matrix @xmath21 where @xmath22 is @xmath16 matrix containing @xmath2 time series of @xmath3 random elements @xmath23 with zero mean and unit variance , which are mutually uncorrelated as a null hypothesis .",
    "statistical properties of the random matrices @xmath24 have been known for years in physics literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown analytically @xcite that , under the restriction of @xmath25 @xmath26 and providing that @xmath27@xmath28 is fixed , the probability density function @xmath29 of eigenvalues @xmath30 of the random matrix @xmath24 is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath34 respectively and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33are given analytically by    @xmath36    random matrices display _ universal _ functional forms for eigenvalues correlations which depend on the general symmetries of the matrix only .",
    "first step to test the data for such a universal properties is to find a transformation called `` unfolding '' , which maps the eigenvalues @xmath1 to new variables , `` unfolded eigenvalues '' @xmath37 whose distribution is uniform @xcite .",
    "unfolding ensures that the distances between eigenvalues are expressed in units of _ local _ mean eigenvalues spacing @xcite , and thus facilitates the comparison with analytical results .",
    "we define the cumulative distribution function of eigenvalues , which counts the number of eigenvalues in the interval @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 denotes the probability density of eigenvalues and @xmath2 is the total number of eigenvalues .",
    "the function @xmath41 can be decomposed into an average and a fluctuating part , @xmath42 since @xmath43 on average , @xmath44 is the averaged eigenvalues density .",
    "the dimensionless , unfolded eigenvalues are then given by @xmath45    three known universal properties of goe matrices ( matrices whose elements are distributed according to a gaussian probability measure ) are : ( i ) the distribution of nearest - neighbor eigenvalues spacing @xmath46 @xmath47 ( ii ) the distribution of next - nearest - neighbor eigenvalues spacing , which is according to the theorem due to @xcite is identical to the distribution of nearest - neighbor spacing of gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) ,    @xmath48    and finally ( iii ) the `` number variance '' statistics @xmath49 , defined as the variance of the number of unfolded eigenvalues in the intervals of length @xmath50 , around each @xmath51 @xcite.@xmath52^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { \\xi},\\label{eq14}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the number of the unfolded eigenvalues in the interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the number variance is expressed as follows    @xmath55    where @xmath56 for the goe case is given by @xcite    @xmath57    and @xmath58 just as was stressed in @xcite the overall time of observation is crucial for explaining the empirical cross - correlation coefficients . on one hand ,",
    "the longer we observe the traffic the more information about the correlations we obtain and less `` noise '' we introduce . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlations are not stationary , i.e. they can change with time . to differentiate the `` random '' contribution to empirical correlation coefficients from `` genuine '' contribution , the eigenvalues statistics of @xmath0 is contrasted with the eigenvalues statistics of a correlation matrix taken from the so called `` chiral '' gaussian orthogonal ensemble @xcite .",
    "such an ensemble is one of the ensembles of rmt @xcite , briefly discussed in appendix a. a _ random _ cross - correlation matrix , which is a matrix filled with uncorrelated gaussian random numbers , is supposed to represent transient uncorrelated in time network activity , that is , a completely noisy environment . in case the cross - correlation matrix @xmath0 obeys the same eigenstatistical properties as the rmt - matrix , the network traffic is equilibrated and deemed universal in a sense that every single connection interacts with the rest in a completely chaotic manner .",
    "it also means a complete absence of congestions and anomalies .",
    "meantime , any stable in time deviations from the _ universal _ predictions of rmt signify system - specific , nonrandom properties of the system , providing the clues about the nature of the underlying interactions .",
    "that allows us to establish the profile of system - specific correlations .",
    "in this paper , we study the averaged traffic count data collected from all router - router and router - vlan subnet connections of the university of louisville backbone routers system .",
    "the system consists of nine interconnected multi - gigabit backbone routers , over @xmath59 ethernet segments and over @xmath60 vlan subnets .",
    "we collected the traffic count data for @xmath61 months , for the period from september _ @xmath62 , @xmath63 _ to december _ @xmath64 , @xmath63 _ from @xmath65 routers , since two routers are reserved for server farms .",
    "the overall data amounted to approximately @xmath66 gb .    the traffic count data is provided by multi router traffic grapher ( mrtg ) tool that reads the snmp traffic counters .",
    "mrtg log file never grows in size due to the data consolidation algorithm : it contains records of average incoming , outgoing , max and min transfer rate in bytes per second with time intervals @xmath60 seconds , _",
    "@xmath67 _ minutes , @xmath68 day and @xmath68 month .",
    "we extracted @xmath60 seconds interval data for seven days .",
    "then , we separated the incoming and outgoing traffic counts time series and considered them as independent . for @xmath69 connections we formed @xmath70 records of @xmath71 time series with @xmath60 seconds interval .",
    "we pursued the changes in the traffic rate , thus , we excluded from consideration the connections , where channel is open but the traffic is not established or there is just constant rate and equal low amount test traffic .",
    "another reason for excluding the `` empty '' traffic time series is that they make the time series cross - correlation matrix unnecessary sparse .",
    "the exclusion does not influence the analysis and results .",
    "after the exclusions the number of the traffic time series became @xmath72 .    to calculate the traffic rate change @xmath73 we used the logarithm of the ratio of two successive counts .",
    "as it is stated earlier , @xmath74-transformation makes the ratio independent from the traffic volume and allows capturing the subtle changes in the traffic rate .",
    "we added 1 byte to all data points , to avoid manipulations with @xmath75 , in cases where traffic count is equal to zero bytes .",
    "this measure did not affect the changes in the traffic rate .",
    "we constructed inter - vlan traffic cross - correlation matrix @xmath0 with number of time series @xmath72 and number of observations per series @xmath70 , ( @xmath76 ) so that , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "our first goal is to compare the eigenvalue distribution @xmath79 of @xmath0 with @xmath29 @xcite . to compute eigenvalues of @xmath0 we used standard _",
    "matlab _ function .",
    "the empirical probability distribution @xmath79 is then given by the corresponding histogram .",
    "we display the resulting distribution @xmath79 in figure 1 and compare it to the probability distribution @xmath29 taken from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) calculated for the same value of traffic time series parameters ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the solid curve demonstrates @xmath29 of eq.([eq6 ] ) .",
    "the largest eigenvalue shown in inset has the value @xmath80 .",
    "we zoom in the deviations from the rmt predictions on the inset to figure 1 .",
    "empirical probability distribution function @xmath79 for the inter - vlan traffic cross - correlations matrix @xmath0 ( histogram ) . ]",
    "we note the presence of `` bulk '' ( rmt - like ) eigenvalues which fall within the bounds [ @xmath81@xmath32 ] for @xmath29 , and presence of the eigenvalues which lie outside of the `` bulk '' , representing deviations from the rmt predictions .",
    "in particular , largest eigenvalue @xmath80 for seven days period is approximately four times larger than the rmt upper bound @xmath32 .",
    "the histogram for well - defined bulk agrees with @xmath29 suggesting that the cross - correlations of matrix @xmath0 are mostly random .",
    "we observe that inter - vlan traffic time series interact mostly in a random fashion .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement of empirical probability distribution @xmath79 of the bulk with @xmath29 is not sufficient to claim that the bulk of eigenvalue spectrum is random .",
    "therefore , further rmt tests are needed @xcite .    to do that",
    ", we obtained the unfolded eigenvalues @xmath51 by following the phenomenological procedure referred to as gaussian broadening @xcite , ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the empirical cumulative distribution function of eigenvalues @xmath41 agrees well with the @xmath83 ( see figure 2 ) , where @xmath51 obtained with gaussian broadening procedure with the broadening parameter @xmath84 .    the empirical cumulative distribution of @xmath1 and unfolded eigenvalues @xmath85 . ]",
    "the first independent rmt test is the comparison of the distribution of the nearest - neighbor unfolded eigenvalue spacing @xmath86 , where @xmath87 with @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the empirical probability distribution of nearest - neighbor unfolded eigenvalues spacing @xmath86 and @xmath46 are presented in figure 3 .",
    "the gaussian decay of @xmath46 for large @xmath88 suggests that @xmath46 `` probes '' scales only of the order of one eigenvalue spacing .",
    "the solid line represents .",
    "nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath86 of unfolded eigenvalues @xmath51 of cross - correlation matrix @xmath0 . ]",
    "the agreement between empirical probability distribution @xmath86 and the distribution of nearest - neighbor eigenvalues spacing of the goe matrices @xmath46 testifies that the positions of two adjacent empirical unfolded eigenvalues at the distance @xmath88 are correlated just as the eigenvalues of the goe matrices .",
    "next , we took on the distribution @xmath89 of next - nearest - neighbor spacings @xmath90 between the unfolded eigenvalues .",
    "according to @xcite this distribution should fit to the distribution of nearest - neighbor spacing of the gse .",
    "we demonstrate this correspondence in figure 4 .",
    "the solid line shows @xmath91 .",
    "next - nearest - neighbor eigenvalue spacing distribution @xmath92 ]    finally , the long - range two - point eigenvalue correlations were tested .",
    "it is known @xcite , that if eigenvalues are uncorrelated we expect the number variance to scale with @xmath50 , @xmath93 . meanwhile ,",
    "when the unfolded eigenvalues of @xmath0 are correlated , @xmath49 approaches constant value , revealing `` spectral rigidity '' @xcite . in figure 5",
    ", we contrasted poissonian number variance with the one we observed , and came to the conclusion that eigenvalues belonging to the `` bulk '' clearly exhibit universal rmt properties .",
    "the broadening parameter @xmath84 was used in gaussian broadening procedure to unfold the eigenvalues @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the case of uncorrelated eigenvalues .",
    "number variance @xmath94 calculated from the unfolded eigenvalues @xmath51 of @xmath0 . ]    these findings show that the system of inter - vlan traffic has a _ universal _ part of eigenvalues spectral correlations , shared by broad class of systems , including chaotic and disordered systems , nuclei , atoms and molecules .",
    "thus it can be concluded , that the bulk eigenvalue statistics of the inter - vlan traffic cross - correlation matrix @xmath0 are consistent with those of real symmetric random matrix @xmath24 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) @xcite .",
    "meantime , the deviations from the rmt contain the information about the system - specific correlations .",
    "the next section is entirely devoted to the analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors deviating from the rmt , which signifies the meaningful inter - vlan traffic interactions .",
    "we overview the points of interest in eigenvectors of inter - vlan traffic cross - correlation matrix @xmath0 , which are determined according to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is @xmath97-th eigenvalue .",
    "particularly important characteristics of eigenvectors , proven to be useful in physics of disordered conductors is the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in such systems ,",
    "the ipr being a function of an eigenstate ( eigenvector ) allows to judge and clarify whether the corresponding eigenstate , and therefore electron is extended or localized .      for our purposes , it is sufficient to know that ipr quantifies the reciprocal of the number of significant components of the eigenvector . for the eigenvector",
    "@xmath98 it is defined as@xmath99^{4},\\label{eq18}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 , @xmath101 are components of the eigenvector @xmath98 . in particular , the vector with one significant component has @xmath102 , while vector with identical components @xmath103 has @xmath104 .",
    "inverse participation ratio as a function of eigenvalue @xmath30 . ]",
    "consequently , the inverse of ipr gives us a number of significant participants of the eigenvector . in figure 6",
    "we plot the ipr of cross - correlation matrix @xmath0 as a function of eigenvalue @xmath30 .",
    "the control plot is ipr of eigenvectors of random cross - correlation matrix @xmath24 of eq .",
    "as we can see , eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , what is within the rmt boundaries , have ipr close to @xmath107 .",
    "this means that almost all components of eigenvectors in the bulk interact in a random fashion .",
    "the number of significant components of eigenvectors deviating from the rmt is typically twenty times smaller than the one of the eigenvectors within the rmt boundaries , around twenty .",
    "for instance , ipr of eigenvector @xmath108 , which corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath109 in figure 6 , is @xmath110 , i.e. twenty time series are significantly contribute to @xmath108 .",
    "another observation which we derive from figure 6 is that the number of eigenvectors significant participants is considerably smaller at both edges of the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "these findings resemble the results of @xcite , where the eigenvectors with a few participating components were referred to as _ localized _ vectors .",
    "the theory of _ localization _ is explained in the context of random band matrices , where elements independently drawn from different probability distributions @xcite .",
    "these matrices despite their randomness , still contain probabilistic information .",
    "the _ localization _ in inter - vlan traffic is explained as follows .",
    "the separated broadcast domains , i.e. vlans forward traffic from one to another only through the router , reducing the routing for broadcast containment .",
    "although the optimal vlan deployment is to keep as much traffic as possible from traversing through the router , the bottleneck at the large number of vlans is unavoidable .",
    "another target of interest is the distribution of the components @xmath111 of eigenvector @xmath98 of the interactions matrix @xmath0 . to calculate vectors @xmath112 we used the _ matlab _ routine again and",
    "obtained components distribution @xmath113 of the eigenvectors components .",
    "then , we contrasted it with the rmt predictions for the eigenvector distribution @xmath114 of the random correlation matrix @xmath24 . according to @xcite @xmath114",
    "has a gaussian distribution with mean zero and unit variance , i.e.@xmath115 the weights of randomly interacting traffic counts time series , which are represented by the eigenvectors components has to be distributed normally .",
    "the results are presented in figure 7 .",
    "one can see ( from figures 7a and 7b ) that @xmath113 for two @xmath98 taken from the bulk is in accord with @xmath114 .",
    "the distribution @xmath113 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath1 , which exceeds the rmt upper bound ( @xmath116 ) , is shown in figure 7c .",

    "]      the distribution of @xmath118 , the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath121 , deviates significantly from the gaussian ( as follows from figure 7d ) .",
    "while gaussian kurtosis has the value 3 , the kurtosis of @xmath122 comes out to @xmath123 . the smaller number of significant components of the eigenvector also influences the difference between gaussian distribution and empirical distribution of eigenvector components .",
    "more than half of @xmath118components have the same sign , thus slightly shifting the @xmath113 to one side .",
    "this result suggests the existence of the common vlan traffic intended for inter - vlan communication that affects all of the significant participants of the eigenvector @xmath118with the same bias .",
    "we know that the number of significant components of @xmath118 is twenty two , since ipr of @xmath118is @xmath124 .",
    "hence , the largest eigenvector content reveals 22 traffic time series , which are affected by the same event .",
    "we obtain the time series , which affects 22 traffic time series by the following procedure .",
    "first of all , we calculate projection @xmath125 of the time series @xmath73 on the eigenvector @xmath118,@xmath126 next , we compare @xmath125 with @xmath73 , by finding the correlation coefficient @xmath127 .",
    "the fiber distributed data interface ( fddi)-vlan internet switch at one of the routers demonstrates the largest correlation coefficient of @xmath128 ( see figure 8) .",

    "( b ) time series defined by the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue within rmt bounds shows no linear dependence on @xmath129    the eigenvector @xmath118 has the following content : seven most significant participants are seven fddi - vlan switches at the seven routers .",
    "the presence of fddi - vlan switch provide us with information about vlan membership definition .",
    "fddi is layer 2 protocol , which means that at least one of two layer 2 membership is used , port group or / and mac address membership .",
    "the next group of significant participants comprises of vlan traffic intended for routing and already routed traffic from different vlans .",
    "the final group of significant participants constitutes open switches , which pick up any `` leaking '' traffic on the router .",
    "usually , the `` leaking '' traffic is the network management traffic , a very low level traffic which spikes when queried by the management systems .",
    "if every deviating eigenvalue notifies a particular sub - model of non - random interactions of the network , then every corresponding eigenvector presents the number of significant dimensions of sub - model .",
    "thus , we can think of every deviating eigenvector as a representative network - wide `` snapshot '' of interactions within the certain dimensions .",
    "the analysis of the significant participants of the deviating eigenvectors revealed three types of inter - vlan traffic time series groupings .",
    "one group contains time series , which are interlinked on the router .",
    "we recognize them as , router1-vlan_1000 traffic , router1-firewall traffic and vlan_1000-router1 traffic .",
    "the time series , which are listed as router1-vlan_2000 , router2-vlan_2000 , router3-vlan_2000 , etc . , are reserved for the same service vlan on every router and comprise another group .",
    "the content of these groups suggests the vlans implementation , it is a mixture of infrastructural approach , where functional groups ( departments , schools , etc . )",
    "are considered , and service approach , where vlan provides a particular service ( network management , firewall , etc . ) .",

    "in this appendix , we provide a short ( and non - rigorous ) explanation of main concepts and glossary of terms used in the rmt studies .",
    "the rmt approaches , which originated in nuclear and condensed matter physics and later became common in many branches of mathematical physics @xcite , have recently penetrated into econophysics , finance @xcite and network traffic analysis @xcite .    for the statistical description of complex physical systems , such as , for example , atomic nucleus or acoustical reverberant structure",
    ", the rmt serves as guiding light when one is interested in the degree of mutual interaction of the constituents . as it turns out",
    ", the uncorrelated energy levels or acoustic eigenfrequencies would produce qualitatively different result from those obeying rmt - like correlations @xcite .",
    "therefore , real ( experimentally measured ) spectra can help to decide on the nature of interactions in the underlying system . to be specific ,",
    "ideally , symmetric system is expected to exhibit spectral properties drastically different from the properties of generic one , and if the spectral properties are those of rmt systems , other ideas of rmt can be brought to the researcher aid .    to describe `` awareness '' of the structural constituents about each other , scientists in different fields use similar constructs .",
    "physicists use hamiltonian matrix , engineers stiffness matrix , finance and network analysts the equal - time cross - correlation matrix .",
    "although the physical meaning of mentioned operators can be different , the eigenvalues / eigenvectors analysis seems to be a universally accepted tool .",
    "the eigenvalues have direct connection to spectrum of physical systems , while eigenvectors can be used for the description of excitation / signal / information propagation inside the system . in physics ,",
    "the rmt approaches come about whenever the system of interest demonstrates certain qualitative features in their spectral behavior .",
    "for example , if one looks at nearest neighbor spacing distribution of eigenvalues and instead of poisson law@xmath176 discovers `` wigner surmise''@xmath177 one concludes ( upon running several additional statistical tests ) that apparatus of rmt can be used for the system at hand , and system matrix can be replaced by a matrix with random entries . for mathematical convenience , these entries are given gaussian weight .",
    "the only other ingredient of this rather succinct phenomenological model is recognizing the physical situation .",
    "for example , systems with and without magnetic field and/or central symmetry are described by different matrix ensembles ( that is the set of matrices ) with elements distributed within distribution corresponding to the same @xmath178@xmath179 where the constant @xmath180 sets the length of the resulting eigenvalues spectrum .",
    "the very fact that rmt can be helpful in statistical description of the broad range of systems suggests that these systems are analyzed in a certain special _ universal _",
    "regime , in which physical or other laws are undermined by equilibrated and ergodic evolution . in most physical applications ,",
    "a hamiltonian matrix is rather sparse , indicating lack of interaction between different subparts of the corresponding object .",
    "however , if the universal regime is inferred from the above mentioned statistical tests , it is very beneficial to replace this single matrix with the ensemble of random matrices .",
    "then , one can proceed with statistical analysis using matrix ensemble for calculation of statistical averages more relevant for the physical problem at hand than the statistics of eigenvalues .",
    "the latter can be mean or variance of the response to external or internal excitation ."
