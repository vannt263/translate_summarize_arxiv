    "beamforming is an ubiquitous task in adaptive filtering and array signal processing problems , and has been found widespread applications in radar , sonar and wireless communications . among the existing techniques ,",
    "the most promising one is the optimal linearly constrained minimum variance ( lcmv ) beamformer @xcite due to its simplicity and effectiveness .",
    "the lcmv beamformer aims to suppress interference at the array output while improving the reception of the desired signal .",
    "the constraint corresponds to prior knowledge of the array response of the desired user @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the direction of arrival ( doa ) of the desired signal and @xmath2 is the number of sensor elements in the array .",
    "the optimal lcmv beamformer requires the computation of the inverse of the covariance matrix @xmath3\\in\\mathbb c^{m\\times m}$ ] with @xmath4 being the received vector , and results in a heavy computational load .",
    "many adaptive filtering algorithms have been reported to realize the beamformer design efficiently .",
    "the well - known adaptive algorithms include stochastic gradient ( sg ) , recursive least squares ( rls ) , affine projection ( ap ) , and conjugate gradient ( cg ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the sg algorithm is simple to implement but suffers from a slow convergence rate and the misadjustment .",
    "the rls algorithm enjoys fast convergence but is more complex to implement and may become unstable due to the divergence problem and numerical problems @xcite .",
    "the ap algorithm requires the inversion of a matrix whose dimension is given by the projection order , which results in a heavy computational load of the ap algorithm if chosen as a large number . besides , the convergence of the ap algorithm is often much slower than the rls .",
    "the cg algorithm has a good tradeoff between performance and complexity since it has a faster convergence rate than the sg and ap algorithms , and requires a lower computational cost when compared with the rls algorithm .",
    "many adaptive cg algorithms have been reported in @xcite-@xcite , and the references therein .",
    "modified cg versions based on the lcmv criterion can be found in @xcite , whereas for other subspace - based algorithms the reader is referred to @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a more economic adaptive algorithm based on the cg method for the lcmv beamformer design .",
    "the proposed algorithm utilizes the set - membership ( sm ) technique @xcite , @xcite to enforce the constraints and to reduce the computational complexity significantly without performance degradation .",
    "the sm specifies a bound on the magnitude of the array output and performs data - selective updates to estimate the filter parameters .",
    "it involves two steps : 1 ) information evaluation and 2 ) parameter update .",
    "if step 2 ) does not occur frequently , and step 1 ) does not require much complexity , the overall complexity can be saved substantially .",
    "sm algorithms based on the sg and rls methods have been reported in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "here , we use the sm technique in the cg algorithm that was reported in @xcite , and develop a new adaptive algorithm , which is termed sm - cg .",
    "specifically , we define a new lcmv optimization problem related to a constraint on the bound of the array output , and perform the filter optimization to calculate the solution .",
    "a parameter dependent time - varying bound is employed to measure the quality of the filter parameters that could satisfy the constraints and to improve the tracking performance in dynamic scenarios .",
    "the parameters are only updated if the bounded constraint can not be satisfied . for the update ,",
    "we define a new cg - based vector @xmath5 to create a relation with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , namely , @xmath8 .",
    "the proposed algorithm calculates @xmath9 via one iteration per update to obtain filter parameters without the matrix inverse .",
    "the updated parameters are encompassed in a parameter space , in which each member is consistent with the bounded constraint and the constraint on the array response based on the optimization problem .",
    "compared with the existing algorithms , the proposed algorithm exhibits an enhanced convergence and tracking performance with relatively low computational complexity .",
    "simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed sm - cg algorithm .",
    "in this section , we introduce a new constrained optimization strategy that combines the sm technique with the lcmv design and utilizes the cg - based adaptive filtering algorithm .      in the proposed scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , the received vector @xmath31 is processed at time instant @xmath32 by the lcmv filter controlled by the adaptive cg algorithm to generate the output @xmath33 . for the existing cg algorithms @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "it is necessary to update @xmath34 for each time instant @xmath32 with many iterations to obtain a good performance . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "the sm technique is embedded to specify a time - varying bound @xmath35 on the amplitude of @xmath33 .",
    "the update only performs if the bounded constraint @xmath36 can not be satisfied . for each update ,",
    "some valid estimates of @xmath37 satisfy the bound .",
    "thus , the solution to the proposed scheme is a set in the parameter space .",
    "the time - varying bound @xmath35 is a unique coefficient for the proposed scheme to check if the update is carried out or not . it is better if @xmath35 could reflect the characteristics of the environment since it benefits the tracking of the proposed algorithm .",
    "we introduce a parameter dependent bound ( pdb ) that is similar to the work in @xcite and involves the evolution of @xmath37 obtained from the proposed algorithm .",
    "the time - varying bound is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a forgetting factor that should be set to guarantee a proper time - averaged estimate of the evolutions of @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is a tuning coefficient that impacts the update rate and convergence , and @xmath43 is an estimate of the noise power , which is assumed to be known at the receiver .",
    "the term @xmath44 is the variance of the inner product of the weight vector with the noise that provides information on the evolution of @xmath40 .",
    "the time - varying bound provides a smoother evolution of the weight vector trajectory and thus avoids too high or low values of the squared norm of @xmath45 .",
    "the proposed sm - cg scheme utilizes the time - varying bound to create a relation between the estimated parameters and the environment . according to @xmath35 ,",
    "we define @xmath46 to be the set containing all the estimates of @xmath47 for which the associated array output at time instant",
    "@xmath32 is consistent with the bound , which is given by @xmath48 .",
    "the set @xmath49 is referred to as the _ constraint set _ , and its boundaries are hyperplanes .",
    "then , we define the exact _ feasibility set _ @xmath50 to be the intersection of the constraint sets over the instants @xmath51 , which is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the transmitted data of the desired user and @xmath54 is the set including all possible data pairs @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 should encompass all the solutions that satisfy the bounded constraint until @xmath57 . in practice",
    ", @xmath54 can not be traversed all over .",
    "therefore , we define a more practical set ( _ membership set _ ) @xmath58 instead . the membership set is a limiting set of the feasibility set .",
    "they are equal if the data pairs traverse @xmath54 completely .",
    "we derive a new adaptive algorithm based on the sm - cg scheme .",
    "it begins with an lcmv optimization problem that incorporates the constraint on the bound of the array output : @xmath59=\\boldsymbol w^h\\boldsymbol r\\boldsymbol w\\\\ & \\textrm{subject~to}~~\\boldsymbol w^h\\boldsymbol a(\\theta_0)=\\gamma~\\textrm{and}~{|y(i)|}^2=\\delta^2(i ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 determines a set of solutions of @xmath45 within the constraint set @xmath60 with respect to each time instant .",
    "the constrained optimization problem can be transformed into an unconstrained one by the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 selects the real part of the quantity , @xmath63 plays the role of the forgetting factor and lagrange multiplier with respect to the bounded constraint and is calculated only if the bounded constraint can not be satisfied .",
    "the scalar @xmath64 is another lagrange multiplier to ensure the constraint on the steering vector of the desired user .    using the assumption , computing the gradient of @xmath47 with respect to and equating it to a null vector",
    ", we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 can be regarded as an alternative form to estimate the covariance matrix @xmath6 . to calculate @xmath47 efficiently ,",
    "we adopt the cg - based adaptive algorithm due to its attractive tradeoff between performance and complexity .",
    "specifically , we define a cg - based vector @xmath67 and use an iterative way to calculate it .",
    "the resulting solution can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is viewed as an intermediate weight vector for enforcing the constraints and avoiding the matrix inverse . in the following ,",
    "we describe a simple cg procedure with only one iteration per update to calculate @xmath69 for computing @xmath37 .",
    "the cg - based vector is expressed by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the direction vector and @xmath72 is the corresponding coefficient .    the direction vector @xmath71 is obtained by a linear combination of the previous direction vector and the negative gradient vector @xmath73 of @xmath74 @xcite , which is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is chosen to provide conjugacy @xcite for the direction vectors .    in order to derive the coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath76 , we consider a recursive form of @xmath77 @xmath78    from @xcite , the coefficient @xmath72 should satisfy the convergence bound @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "according to this bound , premultiplying with @xmath80 and making a rearrangement , we have @xmath81    the relations in are satisfied if @xmath72 is @xmath82 where @xmath83 .    for @xmath76 , since @xmath84 , it follows that @xmath85    the coefficient @xmath63 is important to obtain the filter parameters .",
    "the sm technique provides an adaptive strategy to obtain it following the changes of the scenarios . substituting and into the bounded constraint in and performing some algebraic manipulations ,",
    "we obtain @xmath86 where + @xmath87 ; + @xmath88 ; + @xmath89 ; + @xmath90 + @xmath91 + @xmath92 + @xmath93 + @xmath94 .",
    "the proposed sm - cg algorithm is summarized in table [ tab : cg - sm ] , where the initialization is given to ensure the constraint on the steering vector of the desired user and to start the update . from table [",
    "tab : cg - sm ] , the coefficient @xmath63 is calculated only if the bounded constraint can not be satisfied , so as the update procedure . the data - selective updates save the computational cost significantly .",
    "compared with most existing cg - based algorithms @xcite , the estimation of @xmath69 in the proposed algorithm only runs one iteration per update , which further reduces the complexity .",
    "all the estimates @xmath47 ensuring the bounded constraint until time instant @xmath32 are in the feasibility set @xmath50 .",
    ".the proposed sm - cg algorithm [ cols= \" < \" , ]     regarding the complexity , the algorithms with the sm technique require much less computational cost than their counterparts without the sm technique due to the data selective updates .",
    "since the calculations of the array output @xmath33 and the time - varying bound @xmath35 are the same for the sm - type algorithms , we check their procedures during the updates to compare the complexity .",
    "the proposed algorithm needs around @xmath95 additions and @xmath96 multiplications for the operation , where @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) is the update rate .",
    "these computational requirements are greater than those of the sg - based algorithm @xcite , @xcite ( @xmath99 for additions and @xmath100 for multiplications ) but much less than the rls - based algorithm @xcite , @xcite ( @xmath101 for additions and @xmath102 for multiplications ) , and the ap - based algorithm @xcite ( @xmath103 for additions and multiplications ) with @xmath104 being the size of the signal matrix . in the following part",
    ", we will see that the proposed algorithm spends less updates than the existing algorithms but has a fast convergence and shows an excellent tracking performance .",
    "we evaluate the output signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) performance of the proposed and existing algorithms for the lcmv beamformer . specifically , we compare the proposed algorithm with the sg and rls algorithms with / without the sm technique @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the ap algorithm with the sm technique ( sm - ap ) @xcite .",

    "note that @xmath63 should be a small positive value close to but less than @xmath114 in accordance with the setting of the forgetting factor . in simulations , we limit its range @xmath115 . in fig . [",

    "the algorithms with the sm technique show faster convergence rates than the standard algorithms .",
    "the proposed algorithm has a convergence comparable to that of the sm - rls algorithm and the steady - state performance has a sinr level close to that of the mvdr solution .",
    "it only requires @xmath116 updates ( @xmath117 updates for @xmath118 snapshots ) for the filter design , which is lower than those of the existing algorithms and thus reduces the complexity significantly .",
