    "it is now a well established fact that there exists a large number of substellar objects ( see e.g. the recent review article by oppenheimer et al .",
    "this increases the need for a better understanding of stellar properties at the lower end of the main sequence .",
    "nearby low - mass stellar systems are particularly important for this purpose , because their orbital motion allows dynamical mass determinations .",
    "+ here we will consider the nearby triple system ( other designations : lhs 68 , wds 22385 - 1519 ) .",
    "using speckle interferometry , leinert et al.(@xcite ) and also mccarthy et al.(@xcite ) discovered a companion ( henceforth  b ) located about 04 away from the main component  a. following observations proved the possibility to cover the whole orbit of this binary system within a few years by speckle - interferometric observations . based on 16 data points ,",
    "leinert et al.(@xcite , hereafter l90 ) presented a first determination of orbital parameters and masses .",
    "they derived the combined mass of the system to be @xmath1 .",
    "this was inconsistent with values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 obtained from empirical mass - luminosity relations and stellar interior models ( see l90 and references therein ) . + in the meantime an additional spectroscopic companion ( hereafter called  a ) to  a has been detected ( delfosse et al.@xcite ) .",
    "this is a plausible reason for the mentioned mass excess in , but  given the fact that only @xmath4 now had to be distributed among three stars  raises the question for a substellar component in the system .",
    "+ to improve on the mass determination of the components of we have taken 20 more speckle - interferometric observations and one additional hst determination of relative position .",
    "these show the orbit of the wide pair : b with respect to aa .",
    "we present an overview of the observations and the data reduction process in sect.[obs ] .",
    "the results are given in sect.[results ] , discussed in sect.[discussion ] and are summarized in sect.[summary ] .",
    "a list of the new observations and their results is given in table[speckle - results ] .",
    "the observations numbered 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 used one - dimensional speckle - interferometry .",
    "details of observational techniques and data reduction for this method are described in leinert & haas(@xcite ) .",

    "most of the uncertainty in system mass is from the parallax error .",
    "further improvements in determining this parameter will improve the accuracy of system mass considerably beyond the present @xmath5 .",
    "+ we also want to get a first estimate of the components masses in order to judge the probability for a substellar object in the system .",
    "this can not be done empirically from our data , because there are no published radial velocities for .",
    "instead we use the mass - luminosity relation given by henry & mccarthy ( @xcite ) as    @xmath6    for absolute k magnitudes @xmath7 . +",
    "this approach is only valid if there is no large shift between the spectral energy distributions of the components . to check this we consider the observations taken at other wavelengths . at @xmath8",
    "the flux ratio is comparable to that in the k - band and also to the flux ratios in other nir filters given by l90 ( table3 therein ) .",
    "this supports the conclusion of l90 that both ( visual ) components nearly have the same spectral type and effective temperature . at @xmath9 l90 have measured a higher flux ratio of @xmath10 , but this wavelength lies at the edge of a strong tio absorption feature ( l90 , fig.8 therein ) , so an extrapolation of flux ratios into the visible is not straightforward .",
    "furthermore henry et al.(@xcite ) have observed with the f583w filter of the hst .",
    "the resultant flux ratio in v is @xmath11 and thus again close to the values in the near infrared .",
    "the fact that the flux ratio @xmath12 is nearly constant over a large range of wavelengths indicates that all _ three _ components of the system have similar effective temperatures and thus similar masses .",
    "this idea is further supported by the combined spectrum of ( l90 , fig.8 therein ) that shows the deep molecular absorptions of an m5.5 star .",
    "+ the apparent magnitude of the system is @xmath13 ( leggett@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "combined with the distance given above the absolute system magnitude is @xmath14 .",
    "the k - band flux ratios given in table[speckle - results ] result in a mean value of @xmath15 .",
    "we take the components of the spectroscopic pair  aa to be equally bright .",
    "because we have only given qualitative arguments for this assumption , we use an error reflecting this uncertainty : @xmath16 .",
    "this yields the components absolute k magnitudes :    @xmath17    the resulting masses from eq.[mass - k ] then are :    @xmath18    the given uncertainties originate from the error of the k magnitudes ( eq.[k - mag ] ) and the error of the mass - luminosity relation itself ( eq.[mass - k ] ) .",
    "the sum of these masses is @xmath19 and is thus within the uncertainties consistent with the dynamical system mass @xmath20 derived above .",
    "from a new determination of the visual orbit we have given an improved determination of the system mass in . with simplifying assumptions we have given estimates for the components masses using the mass - luminosity relation by henry & mccarthy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sum of the components masses estimated in this way is consistent with the dynamically obtained system mass .",
    "we conclude that there is no substellar object in the triple system despite the fact that the total system mass is only @xmath21 .",
    "we thank rainer khler very much for providing his software package ",
    "speckle  for the reduction of 2d speckle - interferometric data .",
    "mark mccaughrean has contributed the procedure to calibrate pixel scale and detector orientation with the trapezium cluster which largely improved the relative astrometry .",
