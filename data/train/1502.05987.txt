    "a possibility to dramatically reduce the velocity of ultrashort light pulses in various optical materials @xcite has drawn a great deal of attention , since the observation of slow @xcite and completely halted light @xcite in experiments . however , the controlled storage of this ultrashort light pulse has been a challenge , which hinders their use in broadband optical signal processing , such as ultrafast coding , decoding and multiplexing .",
    "different settings were proposed to realized the slow light , such as electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , simulated brillouin @xcite and raman @xcite scattering , coherent population oscillations @xcite , dispersion engineering in photonic - crystal waveguides @xcite , and others . among these techniques ,",
    "bragg - grating ( bg ) structures , which induce very strong dispersion in a vicinity of the photonic bandgap @xcite , are used too , for the generation the slow light due to its tunability and cascadability in practical applications .",
    "the relation between the delay and bandwidth of pulses was previously experimentally demonstrated in a linear resonant systems @xcite . to support the slow propagation of non - spreading pulses in the bg ,",
    "the kerr nonlinearity may be used , as it is not subject to the limitation of the trade - off between the pulse delay and bandwidth , which is inherent in the linear settings @xcite . standing and moving robust light pulses ( bg solitons )",
    ", whose velocity may be orders of magnitude smaller than the velocity of light in the host material , were studied in detail theoretically @xcite .",
    "producing quiescent pulses by collisions of counterpropagating bgsolitons @xcite was predicted too .    in experiments ,",
    "bg solitons , with the velocity corresponding to @xmath0 of the speed of light in the uniform medium , were first produced in ref .",
    "subsequently , a number of experiments @xcite were carried out to investigate slow - light effects in bg structures . in particular , high intensity of the pulse leads to a change of the local refractive index via the kerr nonlinearity , which helps to enhance the retardation of pulses propagating in the bg structure .",
    "recently , large femtosecond kerr nonlinearity was experimentally demonstrated in cholesteric liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "its large kerr coefficient would considerably reduce the high intensity .",
    "the lowest experimentally demonstrated velocity of solitons in bgs is @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "however , there remain challenging problems impeding the use of the slow light pulses in bgs .",
    "first , the creation of very slow or standing optical modes in bg structures has not yet been reported in experiments .",
    "second , to the best of our knowledge , no work has demonstrated , as yet , controllable trapping and storage of single and multiple pulses at different positions in bgs , a reason being that it is difficult to create suitable input pulses for this purpose , using uniform bgs .",
    "indeed , as the optical fields inside the bg include forward- and backward - traveling waves , generating such very slow or quiescent pulses requires to couple forward and backward waves with nearly equal powers into the bg waveguide , doing which for the backward wave being obviously difficult .",
    "recently , we have proposed a specially tailored structure , built of a linearly chirped bg segment linked , through a local defect , to a uniform grating @xcite .",
    "this setting demonstrates a possibility to create very slow or standing stable pulses , the advantage being that the pulse coupled into the uniform grating may be manipulated by means of the chirped segment .",
    "this scheme makes it possible to prepare the right mix of forward- and backward - traveling fields . using it , the creation of bg solitons with extremely small and zero velocities",
    "was predicted , offering an essential improvement of previously published results @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim to develop the above - mentioned setting by introducing a periodic set of defects into the uniform grating , to achieve controllable trapping and storage of stable single and multiple pulses at different positions in the bg . in section",
    "ii , we present the necessary model , which is based on nonlinear coupled - mode equations ( cmes ) for the bg . in section iii , the operation of the system is demonstrated by means of cme simulations . the paper is concluded by section iv .",
    "the purpose of introducing a chirped bg before the uniform grating with a periodic array of defects is to provide a suitable setting for the generation of slow pulses , which can be subsequently trapped in the main section of the system .",
    "first , the setting without the defect lattice is defined by means of the spatially modulated profile of the local refractive index @xcite : @xmath3 $ ] for ( @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 $ ] for ( @xmath6 ) . here",

    "the nonlinear cme system is an accurate model for the propagation of optical pulses in bgs with the kerr nonlinearity and inhomogeneity of the refractive index @xcite : @xmath14where @xmath15 is time , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are amplitudes of the forward - traveling and backward - traveling waves , respectively , @xmath18 is the group velocity in the material of which the bg is fabricated , and @xmath19 is the nonlinearity coefficient , with @xmath20 being the carrier frequency and @xmath21 the kerr coefficient .",
    "the strength of the coupling between forward and backward waves is @xmath22 , while @xmath23 , which represents the local wavenumber detuning , is    ( z)= _ 0 - 2cz/_0 , & for @xmath4 , + _ 0 - 2cl_c/_0 , & for @xmath6 , [ deltafun ]    where @xmath24 is the detuning at the left end of chirped segment .",

    "we denote the chirped segment of length @xmath9 as chirped - bg ( the chirped bragg grating ) , and the uniform one as uniform - bg ( the uniform bragg grating ) , the length of which is @xmath25 .",
    "the setting implies that the local bg period decreases with @xmath7 in the chirped - bg , hence the nominal bragg wavelength is gradually shifted to smaller values for pulses running through the chirped grating . in other words , the wavelength of the input pulse , originally taken near the blue edge of the bandgap , drifts into the depth of the bandgap in the course of the propagation of the pulse fu2013 . as a consequence",
    ", the power of the forward - propagating wave is gradually converted into the backward wave , helping to introduce the balance between the powers of the two waves , which is necessary for the creation of a very slow bg soliton in the uniform - bg christodoulides1989,wabnitz , sipe .",
    "the soliton s velocity is determined by the remaining imbalance between the powers : @xmath26@xmath27 by introducing a defect at the junction between the chirped - bg and uniform - bg segments , one can create a standing soliton stably trapped by the defect @xcite . here",
    ", we introduce an array of defects in the uniform - bg , as multiple positions at which the stable trapping should be possible .",

    "the further increase of the intensity to @xmath68 gw@xmath63@xmath64 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](e , f ) , leads to the trapping of a stable soliton in the sixth potential well .",

    "its velocity is proportional to the momentum , @xmath90 , see eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) @xcite .",

    "finally , an elementary mechanical analysis demonstrates that the total distance passed by the soliton under the action of the constant braking force is @xmath99 , which explains the quadratic fit provided by eq .",
    "( [ ni ] ) .",
    "the soliton relaxing to the eventually trapped stationary state loses a part of its power through emission of linear waves ( radiation ) .",

[ fig3](b ) . a trend of @xmath102 to decrease with the increase of @xmath59 is explained by the fact that the pulse with larger power passes a larger number of defects , hence it is subject to stronger radiation losses .",
    "this curve also shows a weak oscillatory behavior with the increase of @xmath59 , ratio @xmath103 staying nearly constant in narrow intervals of @xmath59 .",
