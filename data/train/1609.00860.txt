    "there are different ways to make this theory uv complete .",
    "for instance , a number of sm extensions with new vector - like fermions were constructed for this purpose @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested to extend the @xmath40 by three right - handed neutrinos in order to generate neutrino masses .",
    "one last example was recently offered in @xcite by the `` lepton - specific '' representation of a generic two higgs doublet model in which the scalar sector contains the sm higgs , an additional doublet and the dark @xmath1 .",
    "the lagrangian given in ( [ e1 ] ) leads to the following couplings of the new vector and scalar to fermions : @xmath41 with the definitions @xmath42    in our analysis we choose to work with the set of parameters @xmath43 , by assuming @xmath44 which , from the relation ( [ gsgr ] ) , leave us with : @xmath45 in the next section we will preferably consider specific choice of @xmath46 since in the literature bounds and predictions are often presented for the space @xmath47 .",
    "we will also mention this combination in sec .",
    "one of main goals of the model presented in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) was to explain the proton size discrepancy @xcite .",
    "it was first noticed by the authors of @xcite that the @xmath48 decay , with @xmath49 being a set of states seen only as missing energy , can give very strong constraints on the parameters of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was assumed that only an invisible vector state gives new contribution to this process .",
    "we first try to establish parameter space of @xmath47 which is allowed by the proton charge radius and the leptonic kaon decay , including the contributions of both vector and scalar dark bosons as missing mass .",
    "the procedure described above can be summarised as :    * _ proton charge radius _ + the measurement of the lamb shift in muonic and atomic hydrogen ( @xcite ) has indicated a difference for the proton radius square , @xmath50 , which can be abbreviated to ( for details see @xcite ) : @xmath51 as discussed in @xcite , this discrepancy can be properly approached by the model of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) due to the mixing with the photon . moreover , since the dark higgs couples to muons only , the mass @xmath52 will remain free to adjust additional limits . here",

    "( [ gsgr ] ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath55 bohr radius , @xmath56 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath58 one can obtain the 2@xmath59 favourable region for the parameter @xmath36 , using the proton radius discrepancy given in eq .",
    "( [ pcr ] ) : @xmath60 * _ muonic kaon decay @xmath48 _ + in the context of @xmath2 and @xmath1 bremsstrahlung from @xmath61 , the result of analysis in ref .",

    "the grey colour denotes the region excluded at the @xmath67 c.l . by the bound on @xmath68 , while the pink one denotes the region allowed by the proton size anomaly up to @xmath69 .",
    "we have checked if there is any region which can satisfy both conditions . for a large set of the @xmath46 points we could not find any positive solution .    in this section",
    "we would like to illustrate how the muonic kaon decay itself is very restrictive .",
    "once the dark higgs is muon - specific , and we are mainly interested in the regime of small masses ( bellow @xmath70 ) , we have to relax our first assumption and assume that the gauge boson @xmath2 decays to electron - positron pair @xmath71 .",
    "however , such @xmath72 interaction creates additional effects in a number of processes .",
    "the discrepancy between experimental results and the sm prediction for @xmath18 persists as an intriguing low energy puzzle in particle physics , currently being @xmath73 @xcite .    the model of eq .",

    "( [ pcr - reg ] ) there is no dependence on @xmath52 .",
    "we can clearly see this feature through writing the complete expression below ( see @xcite and @xcite ) : @xmath76   \\nonumber\\\\                & \\equiv & \\kappa^2 f(\\lambda , m_v , m_\\phi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the full expression for the one - loop integrals @xmath77 can be found in @xcite .",

    "the first conclusion of our analysis is that the dark photon must decay to an electron - positron pair .",
    "this , however , does not mean that @xmath48 bound is not important anymore , since the scalar @xmath1 still takes a role as a missing mass .",
    "the relation ( [ gsgr ] ) accompanied by @xmath44 , will again produce the excluded region for @xmath79 , even being dependent on @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , given the richness of kaon phenomenology , the new requirement applied on the additional channels involving @xmath2 can produce even stronger bounds on the parameter space :    * @xmath80 + the branching ratio for this process is given in @xcite : @xmath81 + the authors of @xcite considered contributions of @xmath2 via kinetic mixing with a radiated sm photon , as in refs .",
    "they also made a comparison between @xmath82 and the qed background @xcite , having found that a new light vector boson , if it decays before leaving the detector , might produce bumps in the electron - positron invariant mass spectrum .",

    "the bound from the @xmath48 can not be applied .",
    "the @xmath48 constraint should be replaced by the existing upper bound @xcite : @xmath94 the above expression can be useful in the region @xmath95 and as we will find out in the section [ discuss ] , if @xmath52 is close to @xmath92 this constraint is equally powerful as one coming from @xmath48 ( [ pangcond ] ) . since the dark higgs interacts with muons only ,",
    "its decay to @xmath96 is allowed now and @xmath97 . using the narrow - width approximation",
    ", we obtain : @xmath98      within the sm , the @xmath87 pair in the process @xmath99 originates from the virtual photon or z emission in the decay @xmath100 .",
    "analogously to the previous case with @xmath101 , we can consider the upper bound to the ratio of this process by assuming that one can safely use the narrow - width approximation : @xmath102    the differential decay rate for @xmath99 is given by : @xmath103 where we have assigned the momenta @xmath104 .",

    "we point out that the same analysis could be done for @xmath119 , but this is not as restrictive as the constraint ( [ tau ] ) , due to the smaller phase - space .",
    "the standard model contribution to @xmath120 has been recently improved up to the tenth order , corresponding to @xmath121 @xcite , facing the experimental value @xmath122 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the author argues that the one - loop correction to this quantity must be reinterpreted as an effective shift of the fine - structure constant , which would not exceed 15 ppb ( see eq.(6 ) of @xcite ) , leading to the following constraint : @xmath123 the above relation will be considered along with all the bounds presented in the previous subsections .",
    "there are many experimental searches for the dark sector ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "we mention here only the most recent bounds .",
    "the na48/2 collaboration @xcite has searched for bound in @xmath124 decay and obtained that @xmath125 at @xmath126 c.l . for the mass of the vector gauge boson in the range @xmath127 mev .",
    "the kloe-2 collaboration determined the bound on the mass of dark photon and photon - dark photon mixing parameter from the study of dark photon contribution in the @xmath128 decay , by measuring the cross sections @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "they found that @xmath131 has to be smaller then @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the babar collaboration obtained the very restrictive bounds on the dark @xmath133 boson ( corresponds to @xmath2 in our case ) @xcite from the cross section for the @xmath134 process relying on the model described in @xcite .",
    "a basic feature of this model is the absence of the @xmath133 coupling to the first lepton generation .",
    "the babar search is based on 514 fb@xmath135 of data collected at the pep - ii @xmath87 storage ring , predominantly taken at the @xmath136 resonance and their result is applicable also on the models in which the gauge bosons are coupled exclusively to right - handed muons .",
    "they obtained a strong bound on the coupling and the mass of @xmath133 in the region @xmath137 gev @xmath138 gev .",
    "since our model contains both dark bosons , dark higgs and dark gauge boson , we also expect that the inclusion of the dark higgs contribution in @xmath139 might only slightly modify the phenomenology of this channel .",
    "thus , we combine the results of na48/2 , kloe-2 and babar analysis on our plots , which we present in the next section .    .",
    "the colored regions are excluded by the processes denoted on the respective areas .",

    "the eq.([lambda ] ) translates this assertion to @xmath151 , a condition that can necessarily exclude the central value of the proton radius discrepancy .",
    "we can verify this , for instance , in fig.[fig : ps ] . in ( a ) ,",

    "<S> first we assume that both the dark gauge boson , @xmath2 , and the dark higgs , @xmath1 , can not be directly detected and assume that they both are present in the explanation of the proton size anomaly and kaon leptonic decays . </S>",
    "<S> we find a tension between the upper bounds on the decay width of the kaon leptonic decay and the proton size band for a specific range of relevant parameters . secondly , we loose this prior restriction and since we are mainly interested in the low mass region , we continue to treat the dark higgs as the muon - specific scalar , contributing to the missing mass and work in the scenario where @xmath2 must decay to @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the model will be further constrained by the babar additional observables : the uncertainty in @xmath25 , for @xmath26 mev , the upper bound for @xmath7 and by the electron anomalous magnetic moment @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> when the dark higgs mass is in the range @xmath27 , we derive bounds from the experimental upper bound on @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis described above can be considered complementary to the recent babar result @xcite on the search for a new neutral vector boson in the process @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> their result has placed very strong limits on the coupling constant of @xmath2 , indicating that the presence of a massive vector state can be excluded in the range @xmath30 gev .    </S>",
