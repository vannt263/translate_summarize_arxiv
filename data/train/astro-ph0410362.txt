    "the stars , hd  208440 and hd  209339a , were observed by @xmath7 for program b030 . as the two brightest among 5 target stars , they offered better spectra with higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios .",

    "in addition to the f  i line at 954  , the @xmath7 spectra included other lines of use for our analysis .",
    "the weaker f  i line at 951  , though not detected , provided a check on the column density derived from @xmath4954 .",
    "the @xmath19 2@xmath200 , 3@xmath200 , and 4@xmath200 lyman bands of h@xmath1 between 1042 and 1083   were used to infer the h@xmath1 column density ; this column density allowed us to remove the h@xmath1 absorption in the vicinity of 954  .",
    "the lines cl  i @xmath211088,1097 and cl  ii @xmath41071 yielded the total amount of cl along the line of sight .",
    "since the cl  i line at 1088   is partially blended with the @xmath22 0@xmath200 band of co , we had to determine the co column density as well .",
    "this was accomplished by a simulataneous fit to the @xmath22 0@xmath200 and @xmath23 0@xmath200 bands seen in @xmath7 spectra and to @xmath24 bands in stis spectra . finally , the ( relatively ) weak n  i line at 1160   provided the nitrogen column density .",
    "we also utilized archival spectra of the two stars from @xmath18/stis observations .",
    "for hd  208440 , the available spectrum ( dataset o5lh0b ) was taken through the @xmath25 slit at @xmath26 , while the hd  209339a data ( from o5c06 m ) were secured with the highest resolution slit ( @xmath27 ) that provided @xmath28 .",
    "pixels , not subpixels , were adopted for the spectrum of hd  209339a , thereby giving us a higher s / n ratio and a spectral resolution like that for hd  208440 .",
    "these stis spectra were needed for our analysis of the weak o  i line at 1355  , as well as the strong cl  i line at 1347   and the @xmath24 bands of co.",
    "since the ultraviolet measurements lacked the necessary spectral resolution to discern individual velocity components , the basis for the component structure was high - resolution ( @xmath29 ) ground - based measurements ( pan et al .",
    "2004a ) . in particular , we adopted the structure from ch @xmath44300 for our synthesis of the h@xmath1 bands . for the atomic species , we used the velocity components showing absorption from k  i @xmath47699 and the structure seen in ca  ii  k ( 3933  ) for these components . in particular , the @xmath30-values , which essentially are a measure of the turbulent broadening for these species , and relative column densities of the ca  ii lines formed the basis for synthesizing the atomic spectra .",
    "the ca  ii structure was adopted for our syntheses of all atomic profiles because the species analyzed here are likely to be distributed more widely along the line of sight than is k  i. like ca  ii , o  i , n  i , and f  i are the dominant ion in neutral diffuse clouds while cl  i probably represents an intermediate situation .",
    "inclusion of the additional components seen in the ca  ii  k spectrum did not improve the fits .",
    "the features of interest in the @xmath7 spectra covered most of the spectral passband . for the determination of the h@xmath1 column density from the lyman bands , we used three of the four overlapping segments lif-1a , sic-1a , and sic-2b .",
    "the spectra from lif-2b were included in the analysis only when the results were not significantly different .",
    "the f  i lines were covered by segments sic-2a and sic-1b , and the n  i line at 1160    was present in segments lif-2a and lif-1b .",
    "we co - added data from different segments to improve the s / n ratio ; no evidence for degradation of spectra was noticed over the short wavelength ranges of interest to us . for h@xmath1 , uncertainties were inferred from the range of results for individual segments . for the atomic lines ,",
    "the uncertainties were based on uncertainties associated with equivalent widths and were determined from line width and rms dispersion about the continuum level .",
    "our fits were performed with the code ismod , which uses simple rms - minimizing steps in parameter space to reach a desired level of acceptable fit , usually down to 10@xmath31 in parameter relative values .",
    "our modeling of h@xmath1 was based on a line list maintained by s. r. mccandliss .",
    "the normalized continuum was determined by a linear fit of the highest spectral regions for a given segment .",
    "the column density of h@xmath1 is not especially sensitive to the cloud structure for our sight lines because it is derived from damping wings of the @xmath32 = 0 and @xmath32 = 1 lines , the two levels containing most of the h@xmath1 column density .",
    "we made sure that the h@xmath1 model does not go below the observed flux , i.e. , we avoided creating `` emission '' residuals .",
    "in contrast , the stellar flux tends to dip below the fitted h@xmath1 profile owing to the presence of stellar absorption lines that were not synthesized .",
    "these lines , however , are exponentially extinguished by h@xmath1 absorption so that for regions of very low residual intensity , the fitted h@xmath1 profile and the data tend to agree extremely well @xmath20 see figure  1 . in spectral regions with relatively weak attenuation by h@xmath1 , we eliminated the undulations from stellar absorption lines by rectifying the continuum over a short interval up to 1   away from interstellar lines of interest with low - order polynomials .",
    "we used the fact that h@xmath1 and ch track each other well ( federman 1982 ; danks , federman , & lambert 1984 ) in synthesizing the lyman bands .",
    "there are 4 and 2 ch components toward hd  208440 and hd  209339a , respectively .",
    "the relative velocities and fractions were held fixed in our syntheses , but we modified the @xmath30-values of the components to take into account the different masses of h@xmath1 and ch .",
    "this can only be accomplished once the kinetic temperature ( @xmath33 ) is known ; thus @xmath30-values were fitted along with the rotational excitation temperature from the relative populations of the @xmath32 @xmath34 1 and 0 levels of h@xmath1 , @xmath35 .",
    "such a procedure is based on the usual assumption that @xmath35 is a fair representation of @xmath33 .",
    "the final @xmath30-value for h@xmath1 is a composite of the thermal width and the turbulent width , the latter produces most of the broadening in ch . in all , the free fit parameters are total column density , @xmath36(h@xmath1 ) , radial velocity of h@xmath1 , and six rotational excitation temperatures relative to the ground level , @xmath37 .",
    "the results of the syntheses for the component structures and for the column densities appear in tables 1 and 2 , respectively . for completeness ,",
    "the @xmath30-value derived for h@xmath1 and turbulent velocity , @xmath38 , inferred from @xmath30(h@xmath1 ) and @xmath35 are also listed in table 1 . since the sound speed for gas at 80 k that is mostly atomic is @xmath39 1.2 km s@xmath40 , the turbulent motions appear to be essentially sonic .",
    "[ further discussion of the results on h@xmath1 and co will be presented elsewhere ( pan et al .",
    "2004b , in preparation ) . ]",
    "the next step in our analysis was extracting the column density of f  i from the line at 954  .",
    "( the line at 951  , which is affected by the presence of h@xmath1 absorption to a lesser degree , is too weak for detection in many sight lines , including the ones studied here . ) upon application of the h@xmath1 results in tables 1 and 2 to the h@xmath1 lines in the vicinity of 954  , we saw excess absorption which we attribute to f  i. the model for the h@xmath1 lines was divided into the spectrum , revealing the presence of @xmath4954 more clearly .",
    "the f  i absorption was fitted to our template for the atomic lines from measurements on k  i and ca  ii .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the steps yielding an estimate of @xmath36(f  i ) for the gas toward hd  208440 and hd  209339a .",
    "since both sight lines have @xmath36(h@xmath1 ) of about @xmath41 @xmath3 , a limiting column density of @xmath2 @xmath3 , when h@xmath1 absorption becomes black and f  i @xmath4954 can no longer be detected , can be inferred from our spectra .",
    "it should be emphasized that the h@xmath1 model is very robust thanks to its dominance over almost the entire _ fuse _ spectral range , and that around the f i line , the continuum is formed by gently varying slopes from the wings of the @xmath32 = 0 and @xmath32 = 1 lines of h@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the actual curvature of the continuum on both sides of the 954   line is also very robust .",
    "in fact , we use the h@xmath1 template to rectify the continuum , instead of applying an arbitrary polynomial within the iraf / splot task .",
    "this assures a much better match with the actual data .",
    "the only variables still affecting the placement of the h@xmath1 model are the position on the wavelength scale and the alignment of the continuum level .",
    "we found that we needed to raise the continuum level of the h@xmath1 template by 5% in order to avoid generating `` emission '' regions .",
    "this fact reflects the uncertainty involved with the original rectification over the _ fuse _ segment . because we divided by the h@xmath1 profile ,",
    "large noise spikes are generated whenever the residual intensity is very near zero , much larger , in fact , than the noise appropriate to the precise location of the f i line .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath42 , therefore , were inferred from regions beyond the h@xmath1 lines .",
    "some excessive noise is apparent next to the f i line in hd  208440 , where the cores of the h@xmath1 lines seem to be narrower than their templates .",
    "this could be caused by extra noise in this spectrum , perhaps because hd  208440 has lower flux levels than those of hd  209339a .",
    "indeed , the _ fuse _ exposure time was longer toward hd  208440 , but not by a sufficiently large factor to fully compensate for the lower flux levels .    despite the noisy conditions after division by h@xmath1 line cores , there is good signal for the 954   line in both stars , with @xmath42 @xmath43 15 m .",
    "the line is present in the individual segments sic-2a and sic-1b prior to their co - addition .",
    "therefore , there is no doubt that the detection is real , since it is independent of the segment being used , of pixel position , and of the line of sight being probed .",
    "the only issue that has to be settled is whether the observed lines might be stellar in origin , rather than being interstellar .",
    "these lines are indeed interstellar , because their radial velocity agrees very well ( within 2 km s@xmath40 ) with that of the h@xmath1 lines , and because their width is as narrow as the other interstellar lines , while stellar lines are appreciably wider .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in figure 2 , the fit of the interstellar cloud structure to the observed widths is very good .",
    "as noted above , an important ingredient of our analysis is knowledge of the total chlorine column density , @xmath36(cl  i ) @xmath44 @xmath36(cl  ii ) . for cl",
    "i , the line at 1097   is rather weak , while @xmath41347 is quite strong .",
    "the line at 1088   is intermediate in strength and therefore apparently very useful , but it is blended with a co band . by synthesizing the co bands in our @xmath7 and stis spectra with the component structure from ch , we were able to incorporate @xmath41088 into our determination for @xmath36(cl  i ) .",
    "the synthesis of the co bands was done in two parts : fitting the observations of the @xmath24 and @xmath23 bands and then including the stronger @xmath22 band in the model for co absorption .",
    "our values for @xmath36(co ) are @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath3 for the clouds toward hd  208440 and hd  209339a .",
    "the resulting column densities for the chlorine ions and the other atoms are listed in table 3 .",
    "these column densities are based on fits with 7 velocity components toward both stars .",
    "only the velocity zero point was allowed to vary in the syntheses of atomic profiles ; the residuals from these fits are indistinguishable from the fluctuations in the continuum on either side of the profile .",
    "the atomic spectra appear in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "the column densities in table 3 were used for the elemental abundance ratios displayed in table 4 , which includes ratios for the gas toward @xmath9 sco and for the solar system for comparison . for @xmath9 sco , values of @xmath42",
    "were obtained from the literature ( snow & york 1981 for f  i ; bohlin et al .",
    "1983 for cl  ii and cl  i @xmath41097 ; meyer , cardelli , & sofia 1997 for n  i ; meyer , jura , & cardelli 1998 for o  i ) and were converted into column densities through a curve - of - growth analysis with a @xmath30-value of 2.5 km s@xmath40 for the main k  i component ( welty & hobbs 2001 ) . the adopted @xmath30-value is consistent with the value inferred for dominant ions in the main cloud toward @xmath47 oph ( savage , cardelli , & sofia 1992 ) . for the solar system ratios",
    ", we used the results quoted by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) for n , f , and cl and the newly revised solar o abundance ( allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2001 ) .",
    "since n  i , o  i , and f  i represent the dominant ion in relatively dense , neutral diffuse clouds probed by our observations and cl  i and cl  ii essentially all the cl , we do not include the ion stage in what follows .",
    "we first consider the f / cl and n / o ratios , which are measures of unusual atomic abundances .",
    "the three interstellar values for f / cl in diffuse clouds are indistinguishable from the meteoritic value ( 0.16 ) at the 1-@xmath48 level .",
    "this is not surprising since both halogens are expected to have similar solid - state chemical behaviors .",
    "the interstellar values for n / o are also consistent with the ratio of 0.17 found in the solar photosphere , as well as the value ( @xmath49 ) obtained from interstellar surveys on n ( meyer et al .",
    "1997 ) and o ( cartledge , meyer , & lauroesch 2001 ) with a common set of @xmath50-values .",
    "moreover , a relatively accurate column density for atomic hydrogen ( diplas & savage 1994 ) allows us to derive the elemental o abundance , @xmath36(o)/[@xmath36(h",
    "i)@xmath442@xmath36(h@xmath1 ) ] , toward hd  208440 ; the result is @xmath51 compared to the average interstellar value of @xmath52 ( cartledge et al .",
    "2001 ) . a recent independent analysis for this star ( cartledge et al . 2004 ) yielded @xmath53 .",
    "since the lines of sight toward hd  208440 and hd  209339a have similar o and h@xmath1 column densities and similar amounts of reddening ( 0.34 vs. 0.37 ) , we infer that these sight lines do not have enhanced depletion of o onto grains .",
    "as seen in table 4 , the interstellar results for f / o are compatible with each other , but their weighted mean of @xmath54 is about half the solar system ratio .",
    "the bottom panels in fig .",
    "2 illustrate this fact by revealing how a column density for f  i based on the solar system abundance for f is not consistent with the data for @xmath4954 .",
    "this suggests that the sight lines have somewhat more f ( and cl ) depletion compared with the depletion levels for o ( and n ) . the most recent compilation of solar system abundances ( lodders 2003 ) lists meteoritic results for f and cl that are 0.02 dex ( 5% ) lower than the values adopted here ( though within the uncertainties for both determinations )",
    ". such a small difference does not affect our conclusions .",
    "when the levels of depletion for li and k ( e.g. , knauth et al . 2003 ) , two other elements forming relatively volatile compounds , are added to our results for n , o , f , and cl , a trend with condensation temperature ( @xmath55 ) emerges .",
    "[ the comparison is based on the condensation temperatures quoted by lodders ( 2003 ) . ]",
    "relative to solar system abundances , n and o ( @xmath55 @xmath13 150 k ) are depleted by a factor of about 30% , f and cl ( @xmath55 @xmath13 800 k ) by a factor of 45% , and li and k ( @xmath55 @xmath34 1000 to 1100 k ) by a factor of 85% .",
    "there is no clear indication of enhanced f abundances resulting from the @xmath0 process in sn  ii , although the cep ob2 association experienced core - collapse supernovae in the past ( patel et al . 1995 ; 1998 ) .",
    "our sample of two sight lines thus may be too limited to discern the presence of a localized event .",
    "additional f measurements are planned , expanding the sample so that about half the association will be probed .",
    "observations of interstellar absorption from other elements having a @xmath0-process component , such as li and b ( woosley et al .",
    "1990 ) , may aid this quest .",
    "the particular enhancements from the @xmath0 process involve the isotopes @xmath56li and @xmath57b .",
    "the complex component structure seen toward the stars in cep ob2 ( pan et al .",
    "2004a ) essentially rules out a discriminating search based on the very weak li  i doublet at 6708   and on measurements of the @xmath57b/@xmath58b ratio .",
    "data on the elemental abundance of b relative to the f abundance appear to offer the best chance to seek evidence for the @xmath0 process in interstellar clouds . in their model of galactic chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "timmes , woosley , & weaver ( 1995 ) suggest that @xmath0-process synthesis of @xmath57b and f may be the controlling influence on the abundance of these light nuclides .",
    "the computed production rates depend primarily on the abundances of @xmath59c for @xmath57b and @xmath6ne for f. these abundances in the pre - supernova s c- and ne - shells , respectively , are reliably predicted .",
    "hence , the b / f ratio from the @xmath0 process is predictable .",
    "the calculations show that the b / f ratio is increased by a factor of about 30 when @xmath0-process contributions are included , yielding a ratio like the solar system s for sn  ii from stars with solar metallicity . since the @xmath57b/@xmath58b ratio is about 4 in diffuse interstellar clouds ( federman et al . 1996 ; lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) , such a large enhancement for @xmath57b from the @xmath0 process should be easily identifiable in regions affected by sn  ii .",
    "we presented the first interstellar fluorine measurements with @xmath7 and described the methodology to extract the f column density .",
    "the strongest f  i line at 954   is blended with lines from h@xmath1 ; a prescription for extracting information on f  i from the blend was given . in the process",

    "while our goal to find a clear signature for the @xmath0 process from f measurements was not achieved in these first observations , we offered suggestions for furthering the search .",
