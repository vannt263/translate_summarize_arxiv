    "the origin of ray bursts is still unknown and is currently the subject of a `` great debate '' in the astronomical community .",
    "do the bursts have a galactic origin ( @xcite ) or are they cosmological ( @xcite ) ? and what is their distance scale ?    in this letter ,",
    "i do not attempt to answer the first question , but rather , i show that _ if _ one assumes that ray bursts are cosmological in origin , one can begin to answer the second question and place a constraint on the distance scale to the bursts .",
    "this is because cosmological bursts are expected to trace the large  scale structure of luminous matter in the universe ( @xcite , hereafter , lq ) .",
    "the constraint comes from comparing the _ expected _ clustering pattern of bursts on the sky  which will depend on their distance scale because of projection effects  with that _ actually observed_. the observed angular distribution is in fact quite isotropic ( @xcite ) ; hence , only a lower limit to the distance scale can be placed because a sufficiently large distance will always lead to a sufficiently isotropic distribution on the sky .",
    "hartmann and blumenthal ( 1989 ) first used the absence of a significant angular correlation function in a small sample of ray bursts to put a lower limit of @xmath5  mpc on the distance scale to the bursts . to be the hubble constant in units of 100 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 . ]",
    "this lower limit was subsequently improved to @xmath7  mpc ( @xcite ) using the larger batse 1b catalog ( @xcite ) .    here",
    "i use a powerful new likelihood method , which i had previously developed to analyze repeating of ray bursts in the batse 1b and 2b catalogs ( @xcite ) , to compare the observed counts  in  cells distribution in the new batse 3b catalog ( @xcite ) with that expected for bursts at cosmological distances .",
    "i describe this method and calculate the expected counts  in  cells distribution in   2.1 , using the angular correlation function computed in   2.2 .",
    "i present my results on the burst distance scale in   3 , and discuss some implications of this work in ",
    "this work was presented in preliminary form elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be a large number of circular cells , each centered on a random position on the sky .",
    "each cell is of fixed solid ",
    "angle size @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the angular radius of the cell .",
    "i set the number of cells to be such that any part of the sky is covered , on average , by one cell ; hence , @xmath11 . let @xmath12 to be the number of these cells having @xmath13 ray bursts in them , out of the @xmath14 in the batse 3b catalog , where @xmath15 .",
    "then i define the observed counts  in  cells distribution , @xmath16 which is the probability that a randomly chosen cell of size @xmath17 has @xmath13 bursts in it .",
    "the counts  in  cells distribution contains information about clustering of ray bursts on scales comparable to the angular size @xmath10 of the cell .",
    "i now define @xmath18 to be the counts  in  cells distribution that is expected if ray bursts are cosmological in origin and trace the large  scale structure of luminous matter in the universe .",
    "this expected distribution depends on only one unknown parameter , the effective distance @xmath19 to ray bursts ( which i define below ) , because the angular clustering pattern of bursts on the sky will depend by projection on this distance .",
    "the _ likelihood _ @xmath20 measures how likely it is that the observed counts  in  cells distribution @xmath21 is drawn from the expected distribution @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath18 depends on the unknown effective distance @xmath19 to ray bursts , the likelihood is really a measure of how likely a given value of @xmath19 is .",
    "it is given by the multinomial expression @xmath22 combining equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and noting that the factorial term is parameter independent , i obtain @xmath23    the expected counts  in  cells distribution @xmath18 is most easily computed using the generating function @xmath24 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and writing it in terms of the means , over the cell size , of the irreducible @xmath13point angular correlation functions @xmath25",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) : @xmath26 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the density @xmath27 is the mean number of bursts in a cell . indeed , the poisson distribution , @xmath28 , is obtained ( by comparing powers of @xmath29 ) when all correlations @xmath25 are zero ( uniform distribution ) and only the first term in the sum in equation ( 4 ) is included .",
    "now for cosmological ray bursts , the clustering is expected to be weak ( lq ) and can be adequately described by one number , @xmath30 , the mean of the two  point angular correlation function @xmath31 over the cell : @xmath32 then only the first two terms in the sum in equation ( 4 ) contribute to the generating function , and the counts  in  cells distribution is a convolution of two terms : @xmath33 , where the first is a poisson uncorrelated background of single bursts of density @xmath34 , and the second a uniform smattering of correlated pairs , with density @xmath35 , in which @xmath36    once the angular correlation function is known , @xmath30 can be computed from equation ( 5 ) , and the expected counts  in  cells distribution @xmath18 can be found from equation ( 6 ) .",
    "the likelihood @xmath20 can then be computed from equation ( 3 ) , and it is a function of the unknown effective distance @xmath19 through the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath19 .      for simplicity ,",
    "i assume that @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and that the large  scale structure clustering pattern is constant in comoving coordinates .",
    "the results ( cf .   3 ) are , in fact , insensitive to these assumptions because of the small redshifts that are involved",
    ".    the limber equation ( @xcite ) , which relates the angular correlation function @xmath31 to the spatial one , can be recast ( @xcite ; lq ) in terms of the dimensionless power spectrum @xmath39 : @xmath40 ^ 2}\\ ; .\\ ] ]    here the selection function @xmath41 is the probability that a source at comoving distance @xmath42 produces a burst that is in the batse catalog , i.e. , a burst with apparent flux greater than the limiting flux of the batse survey . the selection function is a convolution of a source function , representing the luminosity function and the spatial density of the sources , with an observer function , representing the efficiency with which batse detects bursts of a given flux .",
    "now the cumulative @xmath43 distribution of ray bursts seen by batse begins to roll over from a @xmath44 power law for bursts fainter than @xmath45 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since this is many times above threshold , it suggests that batse sees most of the source distribution and that this distribution is not spatially homogeneous . to the extent",
    "that this is the case , the observer function is unity for nearly all the burst sources , irrespective of brightness , so that batse sees nearly all of the burst sources .",
    "the selection function @xmath41 , then , depends only on the luminosity function and the mean space density of the sources .",
    "i define @xmath19 as the distance beyond which @xmath41 drops appreciably ; thus , @xmath19 is the _ effective distance _ to the `` edge '' of the source distribution in the batse catalog .",
    "one could approximate the selection function to be unity out to a comoving distance @xmath19 , and zero beyond , but evolution of the luminosity function and/or the mean space density of the sources will change the form of @xmath41 from @xmath46 ; more generally , i define the effective distance @xmath19 as @xmath47 ( lq ) .",
    "thus , @xmath19 is not the distance to the very dimmest burst in the batse catalog , but rather the typical distance to most of the dim bursts in the sample .    equation ( 7 ) then becomes , upon rescaling @xmath48 , @xmath49 so that the angular correlation function satisfies the well  known scaling relation ( @xcite ) @xmath50 as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "i take the power spectrum that characterizes the large ",
    "scale clustering of ray burst sources to be the same as that determined from a redshift survey of radio galaxies ( @xcite ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "this power spectrum is characteristic of moderately rich environments , and is intermediate between that of ordinary galaxies and clusters ( lq ) . because the exact bias factor relating the clustering of ray burst sources to that of luminous matter is unknown , such an intermediate _ ansatz _ is reasonable . in any case",
    ", the resultant distance limit depends only weakly on the bias factor ( roughly as the square root ) .    substituting equation ( 9 ) into equation ( 8) , one obtains the expected intrinsic angular correlation function @xmath31 of ray bursts as a function of their effective depth @xmath19 .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath31 ( _ dashed lines _ ) for @xmath19 of 500 , 1000 , and 2000 @xmath53  mpc .",
    "note the scaling of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "now the observed angular correlation function , @xmath54 , is smeared at small angular scales because of finite positional errors .",
    "each burst in the batse catalog is assigned a positional uncertainty @xmath55 corresponding to a @xmath56 confidence that the true burst position is within an angle @xmath55 to the position listed in the catalog .",
    "defining @xmath57 , the smearing function can be approximated as a gaussian of the angular separation @xmath58 between the true and observed positions of the burst : @xmath59 .",
    "if all burst positions are smeared by the same amount , @xmath60 , the observed angular correlation function is a convolution of the intrinsic correlation function with the smearing function and the modified bessel function @xmath61 ( @xcite ) : @xmath62    figure 1 shows @xmath54 ( _ solid lines _ ) for @xmath19 of 500 , 1000 , and 2000 @xmath53  mpc , with smearing of burst positions of @xmath63 , the median value in the batse 3b catalog . note the smearing of the correlation function on scales smaller than @xmath55 , along with the aliasing of some small  scale power to angular scales comparable to the positional smearing .",
    "it is this smeared correlation function that i use in equation ( 5 ) when calculating @xmath30 and the expected counts  in  cells distribution @xmath18 , in calculating the likelihood @xmath64 as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "the cell size @xmath10 is chosen in order to maximize the sensitivity of detection , or signal  to  noise ratio , given the strength of the signal expected . the signal @xmath65 is given by the total number of correlated pairs in the cells ( cf . above eq . [ 6 ] ) : @xmath66 .",
    "the noise @xmath13 is the square root of the total number of pairs ( @xcite ; lq ) : @xmath67 . for a sample of 1122 bursts ( corresponding to the total number of bursts in the batse 3b catalog ) with positional smearing of @xmath63 , the signal  to ",
    "noise ratio is maximized when cells of @xmath68 are used .",
    "figure 2 shows the likelihood of the batse 3b catalog data as a function of the effective comoving distance @xmath19 , calculated using cells of size @xmath68 .",
    "the likelihood is normalized to that expected for an isotropic distribution on the sky . at large values of @xmath19 ( the maximum value allowed is @xmath69 mpc , the size of the horizon in a closed universe )",
    ", the likelihood goes to unity , because by projection a sufficiently large distance will always lead to an isotropic distribution on the sky .",
    "note also that there is no value of @xmath19 for which the likelihood is greater than 1 ; thus , the maximum likelihood value for @xmath19 is @xmath70 , and the 3b data are consistent with isotropy .",
    "the solid line in figure 2 shows the likelihood for a positional smearing of @xmath63 , corresponding to the median value in the 3b catalog . to illustrate the dependence of these results on positional errors ,",
    "i also show ( _ dashed line _ ) the results for a larger positional smearing value quoted in the 3b catalog .",
    "their best  fit model gives a median positional error of @xmath71 .",
    "] of @xmath72 ( with cells of size @xmath73 to maximize the signal  to  noise ratio ) .",
    "small values of the effective comoving distance to ray bursts are unlikely , according to figure 2 ; i find , at the 95% confidence level , that for the 3b median positional error of @xmath63 , @xmath19 must be greater than @xmath0 mpc , corresponding to a redshift @xmath1 .",
    "if the positional errors are larger than quoted and are better characterized by @xmath72 , these results are only slightly weakened ; at the 95% confidence level , @xmath19 must be greater than @xmath74 mpc , corresponding to a redshift @xmath75 .",
    "these limits are not sensitive to earlier assumptions (   2.2 ) on cosmology and clustering evolution , since these only become important at higher redshifts .",
    "they are also conservative limits , in that a constant median value for the positional errors was used rather than the entire distribution of errors .",
    "this is because the bright bursts , which ostensibly are nearer to us , are more clustered ( by the scaling property of the correlation function , eq . [ 8 ] ) and are responsible for the bulk of the expected signal , but , in fact , have smaller errors than the median value .",
    "the faint bursts , which are far away , are hardly clustered to begin with ( even before smearing ) , but have errors larger than the median value .",
    "hence , the expected clustering pattern has been smeared more by using a constant median value ( this permits a simpler calculation and allows eq . [ 10 ] to be used ) than by smearing using the entire distribution of errors .",
    "therefore , the counts  in  cells statistic has been weakened somewhat , and thus the quoted lower limits are , in fact , conservative .",
    "if ray bursts are cosmological and trace the large  scale structure of luminous matter in the universe , and their positional errors are as quoted in the 3b catalog , then the lack of any angular clustering in the data implies that the observed distance to the `` edge '' of the burst distribution must be farther than @xmath0 mpc .",
    "since there are 1122 bursts in the catalog , an effective limit on the _ nearest _ burst to us can be placed by convoluting the likelihood as a function of @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "2 ) with the nearest neighbor distribution of 1122 bursts inside a sphere of radius @xmath19 .",
    "i find that the nearest burst must be farther than @xmath2 mpc at the 95% confidence level , and farther than @xmath76 mpc at the 99.9% level . at this level of confidence , then , none of the bursts that have been observed by batse are in nearby galaxies . a signature from the coma cluster or the `` great wall '' ( @xmath77 mpc ) is not likely to be seen in the data at present , since only a few bursts could have originated from these distances .",
    "indeed , a search for such a signature ( @xcite ) found no compelling evidence for anisotropy in supergalactic coordinates .",
    "the median distance to the nearest burst is @xmath3 mpc .",
    "since the brightest burst in the 3b catalog has a fluence of @xmath78 in rays , this implies that the total energy released in rays during a burst event is of order @xmath4 ergs .",
    "as the number of observed ray bursts keeps increasing , the distance limit will improve .",
    "in fact , lq showed that , with 3000 burst locations , the clustering of bursts might just be detectable and would provide compelling evidence for a cosmological origin .",
    "if it is not detected , the redshift to the `` edge '' of the bursts would be put at @xmath79 or beyond .",
    "i would like to acknowledge useful discussions with carlo graziani , don lamb , cole miller , and bob nichol .",
