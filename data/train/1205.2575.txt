    "electromagnetic reactions which induce excited states of the nucleon are important tools to study hadron structure , and define an intense activity at modern accelerator facilities , namely at mami , mit / bates and jefferson lab .",
    "an enormous progress in these experimental studies has been achieved in the recent years , leading to very accurate sets of data on @xmath6 excitation reactions , for several @xmath7 resonances at low and high @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 )  @xcite .",
    "this wealth of new experimental data establishes new challenges for the theoretical models and calculations , since , in the impossibility of solving exact qcd in the momentum transfer regime of @xmath10 gev@xmath11 , reliable effective and phenomenological approaches are unavoidable .    in this context , we developed a covariant constituent quark model for the baryons within the spectator framework  @xcite for a quark - diquark system  @xcite . because the construction of the electromagnetic current is based upon the vector meson dominance mechanism , it was possible to apply the model also to the lattice qcd regime in a domain of unphysical large pion masses  @xcite .",
    "the model is constrained by the physical data for the nucleon and @xmath0 data  @xcite as well as the @xmath0 lattice qcd data  @xcite .",
    "the evidence of the predictive power of the model comes from its results obtained without further parameter tuning , for the form factors of the reactions @xmath12 @xcite as well as the reaction @xmath6 where @xmath7 can be first radial excitation of the nucleon @xmath13 , and the negative parity partner of the nucleon @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the extension of the model to the strangeness sector was successful in the description of the baryon octet  @xcite and baryon decuplet form factors  @xcite .",
    "all parameters in the model have a straightforward interpretation : they give , for instance , the momentum scales that determine the extension of the particle , and the coupling of the photon with the constituent quark .",
    "importantly , the information extracted from the electromagnetic excitation reactions is also relevant for the interpretation of production processes induced by strong probes .",
    "of particular interest is the study of @xmath15 collisions in elementary nucleon - nucleon reactions and in the nuclear medium  @xcite . in this sector , the hades experiments of heavy - ion collisions in the 1 - 2 gev range play a unique role in accessing nuclear medium modifications at intermediate and high energies  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the near future , the fair facility will expand these experiments further to a higher energy regime  @xcite .",
    "in both cases , independently of the energy domain under scrutiny , the di - lepton channel , the first of which is the low mass di - electron channel , is one of the interesting production channels from heavy - ion collisions expected to signal in - medium behavior .",
    "it is crucial , for the interpretation of both present and planned di - lepton production data from heavy - ion experiments at intermediate energies , to have a reliable baseline made of experimental reference from nucleon - nucleon scattering ",
    "one of the objectives of the hades experiments .",
    "nonetheless , one also needs an extension of the knowledge gained from the experimental studies on elementary electromagnetic transitions , to the timelike region ( @xmath16 ) since the description of the @xmath5 reaction involves baryon electromagnetic transition form factors in that kinematic regime  @xcite .",
    "natural requirements of this extension is that it is well constrained , appears to be robust when tested by its predictions , and allows a direct physical interpretation of the parameters involved .",
    "therefore , in this work we extend our form factor calculations for the @xmath0 reaction to the timelike region and calculate the partial width decays @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we follow the procedure of the standard simulation packages that treat the low mass di - electron production data as a dalitz decay following a resonance excitation  @xcite .",
    "we note , in particular , that according to ref .",
    "@xcite the fraction of di - lepton events compared to the hadronic channels depends significantly on the resonance mass @xmath19 , and on the details of the dependence on @xmath1 of the transition form factors , two features that call for studies as the one we describe here , where such sensitivities are investigated .",
    "we start with the valence quark model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "that model has two important ingredients : the contributions from the quark core , and a contribution of the pion cloud dressing . in the quark core component ,",
    "the @xmath4 system has a quark - diquark effective structure with an s - wave orbital state and small d - wave admixtures  @xcite .",
    "we take here only the dominant s - state contribution which is largely responsible for the magnetic dipole transition form factor @xmath20 , because d - wave states give only small contributions to the @xmath4 wave function ( @xmath21 ) @xcite . since the electric and coulomb quadrupole form factors are determined by the d - state admixture coefficients  @xcite , in the s - state approximation those two sub - leading form factors become identically zero .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation because they are indeed small when compared with @xmath20 @xcite . to the quark core contributions it is necessary to add contributions from the pion cloud , in order to describe the reaction in the physical regime for small momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of our model is that it describes the @xmath0 reaction in the physical and lattice qcd regimes .",
    "the extension of the model to the timelike region presented here is done directly by extrapolating the valence quark model  @xcite , fixed in the spacelike region , to the kinematic conditions of the timelike region .",
    "this means that an arbitrary mass @xmath19 of the @xmath4 is taken to replace its physical mass value .",
    "we also need to generalize the photon - quark current to the timelike region , while keeping its vector meson dominance parametrization  @xcite .",
    "this is done by adding a finite width to the vector meson pole of the current . as for the pion cloud contributions , we study two different extensions to the timelike region .",
    "although similar in the spacelike regime  @xcite , they have very different behaviors in the timelike region . from the obtained results we conclude that the model which includes the @xmath22pt constraints is favored .",
    "this work is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ secformalism ] we introduce the formalism that relates the @xmath4 dalitz decay with the @xmath0 electromagnetic form factors ; in sec .",
    "[ secsqm ] the spectator quark model is introduced and the explicit expressions for the form factors are presented ; in sec .",

    "[ secconclusions ] we summarize and draw our conclusions .",
    "in the simulations of @xmath15 reactions one has to take into account the intermediate excitations of the nucleon , and the @xmath4 ( spin and isospin 3/2 ) resonance is the first relevant one  @xcite .",
    "for that purpose we calculated the contribution of the @xmath4(1232 ) state to the cross section , for an arbitrary resonance mass @xmath19 which can differ from the resonance pole ( defining the mass @xmath24 ) .",
    "the most usual ansatz is the relativistic breit - wigner distribution  @xcite , given by g_(w)= a , [ eqg ] where @xmath25 is the total width , dependent of @xmath19 , and @xmath26 is a normalization factor determined by the condition @xmath27 .",

    "the variable @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 .",
    "the case @xmath45 corresponds to the real photon limit .",
    "the @xmath38 function can be written  @xcite as _ ^n ( q ; w)= y_- |g_t(q^2;w)|^2 , + [ eqgammat ] where @xmath46 is the nucleon mass , @xmath47 the fine - structure constant , and y_= ( w m)^2- q^2 .",
    "the function @xmath48 depends on the @xmath0 transition form factors : @xmath20 ( magnetic dipole ) , @xmath49 ( electric quadrupole ) and @xmath50 ( coulomb quadrupole )  @xcite , and is given by |g_t(q^2 ; w)|^2 & = & |g_m^(q^2;w)|^2 + 3 | g_e^(q^2;w ) |^2 + & & + | g_c^(q^2;w)|^2 .",

    "model 2 , in contrast , gives moderated contributions only ( larger than in the spacelike region but with the same magnitude ) and is therefore a much more reasonable model .",
    "to better compare the two models we have to analyze the real and imaginary parts of @xmath20 separately .    since the valence quark contributions are common to both models , we start by looking to the bare term @xmath62 .",

    "all these contributions to @xmath62 are balanced , and therefore reduced , in the final result , by the pion contributions @xmath63 to be discussed next .",

    "there is no such contribution from the pion cloud and the values for real and imaginary parts are more moderate .",
    "note that the strong peak for @xmath192 gev at @xmath199 gev@xmath11 , for model 1 is a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eqgd2 ] ) , and differs from model 2 by an order of magnitude .",
    "we look now to the imaginary part of @xmath63 .",

    "( [ eqgammar ] ) ] , but in model 2 it is different from zero , although small , ( this is a consequence of the approximation considered in function @xmath159 discussed previously ) .",
    "the second observation is that the significant difference between models 1 and 2 is the sign of the imaginary part of @xmath63 : model 1 gives positive contributions , while model 2 gives negative contributions .",

    "we come to understand the large difference between the two models shown in fig .",
    "[ figgm2 ] .",
    "the figure provides a strong indication that model 1 is not a reasonable model : the results from this model are strongly dominated by the pole @xmath203 gev@xmath11 which induce extremely large ( and probably unphysical ) contributions for increasingly large @xmath19 values . on the other hand , model 2 contains the input from @xmath22pt , and has therefore a more solid basis .",
    "the results are very sensitive to this input and clearly exclude model 1 .    from the previous discussion we favor the results from model 2 .",
    "the final results ( bare quark core plus pion cloud ) for both the real and imaginary part of the form factor @xmath20 are presented in fig .",
    "[ figgmmod2 ] .",
    "one realizes that the real part dominates over the imaginary part for @xmath204 gev@xmath11 .",
    "we can say that the dominant contributions to the imaginary part are the poles from @xmath63 ( induced by @xmath159 ) around @xmath205 gev@xmath11 , and the @xmath99-terms in the quark current from the bare contribution .",
    "the effect of those poles is particularly evident in the curve for @xmath192 gev .",
    "the main and general conclusion from figs .",
    "[ figgmb ] , [ figgmpi ] and [ figgmmod2 ] is that the final structure for @xmath20 emerges from a combination of effects , namely from the vmd model poles and also the pion cloud effects .",
    "the two processes interfere crucially and determine the structure of the final amplitude .",
    "later , we will discuss the applicability of the model for @xmath206 gev , the effect of the remaining poles , and the impact in the observables in consideration .",
    "we emphasize that any extension of the @xmath4 form factors to the timelike region has to rely on models and can not be directly estimated from experimental data only .",
    "it is then important to compare our model with models with a similar content , such as the two - component quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite , also defined in the timelike region . in this last model the contribution from the coupling to the quark core ( valence contribution ) is 0.3% near @xmath87 ( 99.7% of pion cloud ) , while in our model one has 55.9% ( 44.1% of pion cloud ) .",
    "this significant difference between the contributions of the quark core is due to a different , and somewhat arbitrary , classification of the two effects . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the term from the pion cloud is also classified as an effective part of the vmd mechanism , since it is proportional to the function @xmath159 for the @xmath99 propagator .",
    "therefore , in that model the vmd mechanism / pion cloud term is the only relevant effect  @xcite . in our formalism",
    ", the coupling with the quarks is calibrated directly by a vmd parametrization and although it gives the dominant contribution , it is not the only one to affect the results .",
    "our model has the advantage of having been tested successfully by the lattice qcd simulations ( in a regime where the pion cloud is small ) , and of agreeing with the ebac data analysis for the bare quark core contributions to the pion photoproduction data  @xcite .",
    "these tests suggest that our estimation of the quark core structure is under control , since the model is largely constrained in a variety of kinematic domains .",
    "another important point is that our model allows a direct physical interpretation of the parameters involved , in terms of the range of the baryon wave functions .",

    "this procedure adds a new parameter to the model .",
    "we started by verifying that a large width @xmath230 ( for instance @xmath231 gev ) will affect the results for @xmath232 gev , while a very small width will induce significant oscillations in the functions @xmath233 and @xmath234 ( enhancement of @xmath235 near the poles ) . by taking @xmath236 the results obtained for @xmath237 gev are almost unchanged , and the results for @xmath238 gev are also smooth functions of @xmath19 . with this choice the smooth dependence on @xmath19 of the functions @xmath233 and @xmath234 , obtained with model 2",
    "is maintained for higher @xmath19 values .",
    "we stress , nevertheless , that the application of our model to large @xmath19 values is to be viewed only as an extreme test to its limits .",
    "in this work we have presented a covariant approach to describe the the dalitz decays @xmath17 , @xmath40 , and we have calculated the @xmath4 mass distribution function @xmath208 within that approach . our framework can be used to simulate the @xmath239 reaction at moderate beam kinetic energies ( @xmath240 gev ) .",

    "we start with a model tested previously in spacelike physical and lattice qcd simulation data @xcite , and generalize it to the timelike regime . in this formalism",
    "the electromagnetic interaction can be decomposed into two mechanisms : the direct photon coupling with the quarks and the interaction with the pion cloud .",
    "for the first mechanism we extended the quark current and wave functions , obtained for @xmath241 , to the region @xmath242 without additional changes , except for a non - zero width of the effective vector mesons included in the vmd parametrization of our quark electromagnetic current .",
    "for the pion cloud contribution we probed two different parametrizations : a naive generalization of our spacelike model and a more elaborated model based on @xmath22pt .",
    "although the two models behave very similarly in the spacelike region , they differ substantially in the timelike region .",
    "the results of the models for the form factor @xmath20 , as a function of @xmath43 and @xmath19 , are used to calculate the partial widths @xmath36 , @xmath243 and the partial mass distributions functions @xmath233 , @xmath234 .",
    "a first important conclusion of this work is that the @xmath1 dependence of the form factor has an impact in the final results , and has therefore to be under control : the results for the @xmath4 mass distribution functions , where the form factor is taken with its full @xmath1 dependence , can differ by a factor of 4 from the results obtained with the constant form factor model .",
    "we verified also that the results are sensitive to the analytical extension of the pion cloud parametrization to the timelike region .",
    "model 1 ( naive model ) generates unreasonably large contributions for moderate squared momentum @xmath1 , for larger values of @xmath19 , as consequence of a spurious ( not physically motivated ) pole @xmath244 in the pion cloud contribution .",
    "model 2 is motivated by @xmath22pt and includes the function @xmath159 for the @xmath99 propagator with a non - algebraic pole near @xmath179 gev@xmath11 originated by pion loop corrections .",
    "this model gives smooth contributions to the partial @xmath4 mass distribution functions @xmath233 and @xmath234 that vary slowly with @xmath19 for large @xmath19 .",
    "a second important conclusion is then that our calculations support the need to have under control the effect of the pion cloud contributions .",
    "our framework is suitable for this because its bare quark core component is constrained by experimental data and lattice qcd simulation data .",
    "in addition , the fact that the pion cloud content of model 2 is consistent with @xmath22pt makes model 2 reliable , at least in its domain of validity .",
    "the results of model 2 give moderated contributions for @xmath245 ( since it has no spurious pole at @xmath198 ) , which are determined by the combined effect of two important features : the pion cloud term structure near @xmath246 gev@xmath11 , and the quark core contributions from the @xmath145pole included in the vmd structure of the quark current , near @xmath247 gev@xmath11 .",
    "we may say that while spacelike data does not constrain models sufficiently well enough , timelike data for @xmath248 for different values of @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ figdgamma ] ) are important and necessary to select between models in a decisive way . in the @xmath4 case discussed in this work",
    "this is specially true for the pion cloud effects .",
    "but the timelike data can also be useful to calibrate the widths and high mass poles of the vmd parametrization of the current needed in valence quark component , particularly for resonances heavier that the @xmath184 .    for high values of @xmath19",
    "the assumption that the @xmath184 resonance is the only state playing a role in the reactions becomes questionable . in the regime @xmath249 gev other resonances can be relevant , as the spin 1/2 resonances @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "once those states are calibrated for the @xmath250 gev@xmath11 region , one can extend the models from refs .",
    "@xcite to the timelike region too .",
    "it is also expected that the spin 3/2 channels as the @xmath225 state are important for large @xmath19 .",

    "future applications of our formalism can include the study of the @xmath251 reaction where the final nucleon has an arbitrary mass @xmath19 , also in the timelike region . since the quark current was already defined in the timelike region and we have already a model for the nucleon system @xcite , no additional ingredients are necessary .",
