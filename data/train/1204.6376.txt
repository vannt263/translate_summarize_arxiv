    "there are two major local minima in the landscape , nodes 10 and 18 .",
    "node 10 is the bound state which is the minimum in the most populated energy basin .",
    "its attraction basin is colored in light blue .",
    "nodes 11 ( population @xmath167 ) and 5 ( population @xmath168 ) are two encounter complexes in that basin . in these states ,",
    "the ligand is in or close to the binding site and conformations in this state have a small twist but large opening angles .",
    "the other local minimum is node 18 , a misbound state , where the ligand interacts with the protein outside the binding site and close to the hinge region of two domains of the protein .",
    "state 18 , together with state 4 , 8 , 9 , and 20 , forms a misbound basin marked in red . in these states",
    ", the ligand interacts with the protein from a distance to the binding site .",
    "state 8 and 9 exhibit similar structural properties with a negative twisting angle and a fixed distance to the binding site ( about @xmath169 ) , while state 4 , 18 , and 20 exhibit similar but a different type of structures .",
    "node 19 and 14 are two index-@xmath27 saddles connecting the two basins associated with local minima .",
    "they are metastable intermediate states between misbound and bound states .",
    "but in these saddles ligand interacts with the protein in different ways . in state 19 ( population @xmath170 ) , the ligand is interacting with the protein from one twisting direction ( positive ) and the protein is quite closed . in a contrast , in state 14 ( population @xmath171 ) the ligand is approaching the protein from the opposite twisting direction ( negative ) and the protein is still quite open ( see si ) .",
    "these two saddles actually play different roles in reactive pathways which will be discussed below .",
    "node 2 is an index-@xmath59 saddle , which is essentially a high energy misbound state .",
    "note that high index saddles are unstable with respect to different thresholding values . in the following",
    "we shall focus on index-@xmath27 saddles .    for a quantitative analysis on the roles of index-@xmath27 saddles , we conduct two kinds of transition path analysis using transition path theory ( @xcite or see si ) .",
    "first , we study reactive currents from the misbound state 18 to the bound state 10 .",
    "this analysis shows that a majority of flux passes through the saddle 19 .",
    "therefore once the ligand and protein fall in the misbound state 18 , the major pathway to escape and enter the bound state is via saddle 19 .",
    "the other analysis , as was also did in @xcite , studies transition paths from the eleven solvated states marked from 43 to 53 to the bound state 10 .",
    "in particular , we investigate reactive currents from each of the solvated states to the bounded state , respectively .",
    "the results are summarized as follows .",
    "a large part of these details has been ignored in @xcite , since they only examined @xmath172 transition pathways , ignoring the others .    1 .",
    "solvated state 52 lies in the basin of bound state 10 , whence misbound state 18 has little influence on its pathway .",
    "2 .   solvated state 53 only passes through index-@xmath27 critical node 19 to enter the bound state 10 , which is heavily influenced by the misbound state 18 .",
    "3 .   solvated states @xmath173 lie in the basin of index-1 critical node 14 and enter the bound state 10 directly or via 14 .",
    "they are not much influenced by the misbound state 18 .",
    "other solvated states are in the basin of index-2 critical node 2 .",
    "transition path analysis further shows that misbound state 18 has a stronger influence on them than those in the basin of 14 . in particular state 50",
    "is mostly influenced with near @xmath174 of transition currents trapped by the misbound state 18 .    in summary",
    ", the misbound state 18 affects some of the pathways from solvated states to the bound state .",
    "index-1 critical node 14 is a state where ligand starts to interact with protein to enter the encounter complex 11 .",
    "if we can design some mutations to disrupt the stability of this state or even encounter complexes , we may be able to make the binding much more difficult .",
    "finally we note that the critical node analysis here does not rely on the markov model assumption and can thus be applied to the analysis of transition networks in molecular dynamics beyond its markovian time scale .",
    "we have introduced a notion of critical points for network which can be used to reduce a complex network to a coarse - grained representation while preserving structural properties associated with functional gradient flows .",
    "examples have shown that the information obtained this way is of great value in capturing global structure and dynamics of the network , such as diffusive or reactive pathways . moreover",
    ", the critical point analysis leads to a hierarchical decomposition which may enable us to perform multiscale analysis of complex networks .",
    "these perspectives will be systematically pursued in the future .",
    "an interesting question is the stability of these objects against noise . to answer this question",
    ", one has to clarify the source of noise .",
    "there are two types of noise one should consider in landscape analysis of networks ",
    "one associated with the energy function @xmath5 and the other associated with the network structure .",
    "the former can be dealt with traditional persistent homology denoising , where critical nodes with shallow basins can be merged with their saddles .",

    "<S> landscape _ when we study a function on the node set . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of landscape has been crucial in physics and chemistry in describing complex systems , such as energy landscape @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of such a concept into complex networks may equip us with a concise description of global structures of networks and help explain certain dynamics such as information diffusion and transition pathways . </S>",
    "<S> many complex networks in real world carry flows of information , products , power , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , which are driven by local gradients of a scalar or energy @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> precisely , consider an undirected graph @xmath0 with a function defined on the node set @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the question we will attempt to address is : _ given a function on its nodes , how can we endow the network with a landscape , so that one can distinguish critical nodes such as the local minima , local maxima , and saddles _ ?    </S>",
    "<S> there are several studies in the literature which may lead to critical nodes for graphs by carrying morse theory to discrete settings . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , none of them gives a satisfied answer to the question . in computational geometry </S>",
    "<S> one may embed the graph into a 2d - surface and then apply morse theory for 2-manifolds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a surface embedding is not natural for general graphs in biological and social networks . </S>",
    "<S> another candidate is discrete morse theory @xcite , which studies functions defined on all faces of cell complexes and is therefore hard to use in the graph setting above . </S>",
    "<S> a related subject is the extension of the poincare - hopf theorem to the graph setting , e.g. in @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a purely combinatorial approach which starts from a discrete gradient flow induced by the function on graph nodes . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach does not need a surface embedding , and turns out to be closely related to persistent homology in computational topology @xcite and discrete morse theory @xcite without studying functions on high dimensional cells . </S>",

    "<S> this allows us to define critical nodes or saddles . roughly speaking , critical nodes </S>",
    "<S> are associated with minimum energy paths between node pairs : index-@xmath2 critical nodes are simply local minima ; index-@xmath3 critical nodes are the highest energy transition nodes of minimal energy paths connecting index-@xmath4 critical nodes .    </S>",
    "<S> such a critical node analysis , as we show by examples in social networks and biological networks , leads to a concise representation of networks while preserving some important structural properties . in short </S>",
    "<S> , the local minima or maxima together with their attraction basins can be interpreted as communities or groups in networks ; saddle points act as transition states between different critical points of lower indices . in particular , in social networks index-1 saddles act as hubs in connecting communities ; in biomolecular dynamics , index-1 saddles play roles as intermediate or transition states connecting misfolded and native states . in the latter , </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis does not rely on commonly used markov state model , whence can be applied to much more general data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this approach leads to a hierarchical classification of nodes in the network and a global visualization of networks adaptive to the landscape of given energy function .    in algorithmic aspect , critical nodes in this paper </S>",
    "<S> can be computed at a polynomial time cost with an algorithm based on computational topology by monitoring topological changes over energy evel sets , and in nondegenerate case an almost linear algorithm exists which is scalable for the analysis of large scale networks . </S>"
