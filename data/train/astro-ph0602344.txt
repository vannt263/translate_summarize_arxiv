    "the spm allows the @xmath99 of neighboring galaxies to also influence test particles .",
    "the addition of @xmath99 from neighboring galaxies , which is not radial in general , in a dense environment is unaccounted in mond . therefore , because of the differing environmental densities , the spm expects mond to apply to @xmath6 elliptical galaxies and to fail for bright elliptical galaxies .",

    "therefore , the objection to a newtonian flat , finite universe is overcome .    at larger distance ( say @xmath227  mpc ) the @xmath228 and @xmath229 terms approach an average per unit distance because the total number of encounters with sources and sinks per unit distance becomes nearly constant .",
    "therefore , if the volumes considered are greater than the spacing between several clusters , the mass distribution of the universe appears homogeneous and the hubble law is recovered for cosmological scale distance .",

    "a speculative example of a possible physical mechanism is galactic wind @xcite .",
    "the shells of outward flowing , shocked gas around the galactic center @xcite@xcite and the presents of heavy - element ions in the intracluster medium suggests the emission of the ubiquitous , corporeal wind media is from the center of spiral galaxies .",
    "if all stars emit matter in addition to radiation , newton s spherical property and , hence , the inverse square law may be applied to the effect of the wind .",
