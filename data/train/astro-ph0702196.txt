    "a very commonly assumed model for pulsar spin - down posits that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pulse frequency , @xmath6 is the frequency derivative , @xmath7 is a constant and @xmath8 is the braking index .",
    "the braking index is then given by @xmath9 the braking index provides insight into the physics that drives pulsar spin - down .",
    "typically , it is assumed that magnetic dipole radiation underlies pulsar evolution , resulting in @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , other processes could , in principle , cause the pulsar to radiate and would result in different values for @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "for example , a pulsar spun down entirely by the loss of relativistic particles would have @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a pulsar losing energy via gravitational radiation or quadrupole magnetic radiation would spin down with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "braking indices have proven difficult to measure . to date , only six have been reported even though more than 1600 pulsars are known . evidently , the pulsar properties necessary for a measurement of @xmath8 are rare ; the pulsar must : spin down quickly ; experience few , small , and relatively infrequent glitches ; and be relatively uncontaminated by timing noise , a low - frequency stochastic process superposed on the deterministic spin - down of the pulsar .",
    "the youngest pulsars , of which the crab pulsar is the most famous example , uniquely possess these three qualities .",
    "the reason then for the paucity of measured values of @xmath8 is a direct consequence of the relative rarity of very young pulsars , i.e. those with characteristic ages on the order of 1kyr , where characteristic age is defined as @xmath13    of the six pulsars with measured @xmath8 , five were obtained via phase - coherent timing .",
    "all five of these pulsars : psrs  j1846@xmath00258 , b0531 + 21 ( the crab pulsar , @xmath14 ) , b1509@xmath058 , j1119@xmath06127 ( @xmath15 ) , and b0540@xmath069 , have characteristic ages less than 2kyr @xcite .",
    "the sixth measurement , that of the vela pulsar ( @xmath16 ) , could not be obtained with phase - coherent timing due to large glitches @xcite . timing noise and large glitches begin to seriously contaminate measurements of @xmath8 when pulsars have characteristic ages @xmath17kyr @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we present braking index measurements for each of these pulsars obtained via phase - coherent timing .",
    "the most accurate method of extracting pulsar timing parameters is phase - coherent timing , that is , accounting for every turn of the pulsar .",
    "pulse times of arrival ( toas ) are measured and fitted to a taylor expansion of pulse phase , @xmath18 at time @xmath19 given by @xmath20 where subscript 0 denotes a parameter at the reference epoch , @xmath21 .",
    "toas and initial spin parameters are input to pulse timing software ( e.g. tempo ) and refined spin parameters and timing residuals are output .    the existence of timing noise and glitches in young pulsars is well known to contaminate the measurement of deterministic spin parameters .",
    "though powerful , a fully phase - coherent timing solution can be sensitive to these contaminants .",
    "in such cases , a partially coherent method may be employed . in this case , local phase - coherent measurements of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and possibly @xmath22 are made . though the effects of timing noise can not be eliminated , the noise component is more readily identified and separated from the deterministic component of the spin - down , as shown in section  [ sec:1509 ] .",
    "in addition , glitches can be easier to identify with this method , as will be shown in section  [ sec:0540 ] of this paper .",
    "in this paper we describe observations of three young pulsars psrs  j1846@xmath00258 , b1509@xmath058 , and b0540@xmath069 taken with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) .",

    "the pca operates in the 2 - 60kev energy range , has an effective area of @xmath236500@xmath24 and has a 1 degree field of view .",
    "while rxte  has no imaging capability , it has excellent time resolution of @xmath25@xmath26s @xcite .",
    "this makes rxte  ideal for observing young , rapidly rotating pulsars .",
    "observations of psr  b1509@xmath058 were taken in + `` goodxenonwithpropane '' mode , while observations of the other two sources were taken in `` goodxenon '' mode .",
    "both modes record the photon arrival time with @xmath27s - resolution and photon energy with 256-channel resolution .",
    "the number of pcus active during an observation varies , but is typically three . for psrs  b1509@xmath058 and j1846@xmath00258 , which have relatively hard spectra ,",
    "all three xenon layers and photons with energies ranging from 2 - 60kev were used , while for the softer spectrum source , psr  b0540@xmath069 , only the top xenon layer and photons with energies ranging from 2 - 18kev were used .",

    "data were reduced using standard fits tools as well as in - house software developed for analyzing rxte  data for pulsar timing .",
    "data from different pcus were merged and binned at ( 1/1024)s resolution .",

    "another suggestion is that a fall - back disk formed from supernova material modulates the spin - down of young pulsars , providing a propeller torque in addition to the torque from magnetic dipole radiation .",

    "specifically , the pulsar has a faster rate of spin down when it is observed in the radio waveband than when it goes undetected .",
    "this implies a connection between the radio emission mechanism and the spin - down torque .",
    "the interpretation presented by the authors is that the radio emission mechanism is only active when sufficient plasma is present in the magnetosphere , and that this plasma exerts a torque on the pulsar , spinning it down faster than in the absence of plasma .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then all observable pulsars should have @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the solution to the @xmath75 problem is related to the angle between the spin and magnetic axes , @xmath79 , as well as to currents in the magnetosphere .",
    "melatos postulates that the magnetosphere can be considered to be split into two sections , an inner and outer magnetosphere .",
    "the division occurs at the ` vacuum ' radius , the location where particles are no longer confined to field lines .",
    "the inner magnetosphere will then corotate with the neutron star and can be considered part of the radius of the rotating dipole .",
