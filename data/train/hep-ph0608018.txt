    "the meson light - cone distribution amplitude ( da ) plays an essential role in describing exclusive hadronic reactions  @xcite .",
    "while the leading - twist das provide major contribution to those processes , higher - twist das are suppressed by the inverse of the momentum transfer @xmath12 , so that higher - twist das are less significant in studying high - energy exclusive processes .",
    "because of this fact , not many investigations on higher - twist das were performed  @xcite , compared to the leading - twist ones",
    ". however , higher - twist das should be still important , since they give crucial information on the soft part of exclusive hadron reactions , in particular , in the smaller @xmath12 region .",
    "moreover , it describes the transverse motion of quarks inside the meson  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we aim at investigating the two - particle twist-3 pion and kaon das within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model ( @xmath13qm ) from the instanton vacuum , taking into account su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects .",
    "the instanton model of the qcd vacuum provides a good framework to study the structure of light mesons , since spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is well realized in the instanton vacuum via the quark zero mode  .",
    "this instanton vacuum model was later extended by introducing the current - quark masses  @xcite .",
    "it was assumed in the model that the large @xmath14 expansion is the reasonable one and the results were obtained in the leading order in this expansion . in the present approach , we employ the modified effective chiral action with flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects derived from the instanton vacuum  .",
    "the model has been applied to describe the leading - twist meson das  @xcite .",
    "one of the two - particle twist-3 pion das was already studied within the nonlocal @xmath13qm in the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "there are two independent particle - two twist-3 distribution amplitudes defined as : @xmath15 where the subscript @xmath16 denotes either the pion ( @xmath17 ) or the kaon ( @xmath18 ) with on - mass - shell momentum @xmath19 in the light - cone frame . @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand for the longitudinal momentum fraction and the light - like vector satisfying @xmath22 , respectively . the spatial separation between the quarks inside the meson is represented by @xmath23 . in the present work ,",
    "we drop the wilson line by considering the light - cone gauge , @xmath24 . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the corresponding current quark masses with given flavors @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as for the present case ,",

    "( [ das ] ) and ( [ dat ] ) , we start from the low - energy effective qcd partition function derived from the instanton vacuum in euclidean space as follows  @xcite : @xmath34 ,     \\label{effectiveaction }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the fields for the quark and pseudoscalar meson .",

    "the background pseudoscalar meson field @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 @xmath40 is the well - known su(3 ) gell - mann matrices .",
    "now we are in a position to construct the quark propagator in the instanton ensemble .",
    "there have been several approaches for this purpose  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we make use of the prescription suggested by pobylitsa  @xcite and musakhanov  @xcite .",
    "we attempt to discuss it briefly in order .",
    "first , diakonov _ et al .",
    "_ introduced the quark propagator under the instanton effects by taking into account the following assumption  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 stand for the single instanton field and the quark zero mode , respectively .",
    "however , this assumption loses information on higher quark loops although it turns out that it works very well from phenomenological point of view . on the contrary ,",
    "pobylitsa expand the quark propagator @xmath44 straightforwardly by virtue of the large @xmath14 limit  @xcite .",
    "thus , all non - planar diagrams are removed from the expansion .",
    "one then obtains an integral equation as follows : @xmath45^{-1 }   + ( i\\to\\bar{i})\\right ] ,   \\label{full }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 indicates the instanton coordinate for the instanton and antiinstanton . by solving eq .",

    "although the form factor @xmath56 can be derived from the fourier transform of the quark zero mode , we will use the following simple parameterization for it : @xmath57 ^{2n }   \\left [ \\sqrt{1+\\frac{m_{f}^{2}}{d^{2}}}-\\frac{m_{f}}{d}\\right ] .",
