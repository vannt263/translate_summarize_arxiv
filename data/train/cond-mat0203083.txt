    "muffin - tin orbitals ( mtos ) have been used for a long time in _ ab initio , e.g. _ density - functional ( df ) , calculations of the electronic structure of condensed matter . over the years , several mto - based methods have been developed .",
    "the ultimate aim is to find a generally applicable electronic - structure method which is _ intelligible , fast , _ and _ accurate .",
    "_    in order to be _",
    "intelligible , _ an electronic - structure method must employ a _ minimal _ and _ flexible _ basis of _ short - ranged _ orbitals . as an example , the method should be able to describe the valence band and the lower part of the conduction band in @xmath0-bonded materials using merely four short - ranged @xmath2- and @xmath3-orbitals per atom and , for insulating phases , using merely occupied orbitals such as bond orbitals .",
    "another example is materials with strong electronic correlations . for such materials",
    ", one must first construct a small , but realistic hilbert space of many - electron wave functions , and this requires an accurate and flexible single - particle basis of atom - centered short - ranged orbitals .",
    "a small basis of short - ranged orbitals is a prerequisite for a method to be intelligible and _ fast , _ but it may be a hindrance for its _ accuracy , _  because the orbitals of a smaller basis tend to be more complicated than those of a larger basis .",
    "most other density - functional methods , such as plane - wave pseudopotential , lapw , paw , and lcao methods , aim at _ simulation , _ and are therefore primarily _ accurate _ and _ robust .",
    "_ but they are neither fast nor intelligible in the above - mentioned sense , because they employ basis sets with of order hundred functions per atom . with such methods , _ understanding",
    "_ can therefore only be attempted _",
    "after _ the calculation , by means of projections onto _ e.g. _ wannier functions in case of insulators , _  _ charge densities , electron - localization functions ( elfs ) , partial waves , a.s.o ..    the so - called 3rd - generation mto method ( andersen _ et al _ 1994 , andersen _ et al _ 1998 , andersen _ et al _ 2000 , tank and arcangeli 2000 , andersen and saha - dasgupta 2000 ) should come close to what we have been aiming for . in the present paper",
    "we shall explain what 3rd - generation mtos are and what they achieve .",
    "emphasis will be on the so - called _ downfolding _ and _ energy - mesh _ features which enable mto bases to be small , flexible , and accurate , as we shall demonstrate by exposing them to the above - mentioned @xmath0-test . from the result ,",
    "the idea emerges , that for _ band insulators , _ an mto basis can be designed _ a priori _ to span the hilbert space of the _ occupied _ states only .",
    "that is , there is one , and only one , such mto per electron . to get this count right",
    ", one may associate each orbital with a nominal electron ( or pair ) , and leave it to the method to _ shape _ the orbitals in such a way that the basis set becomes complete for the occupied states .",
    "this can be done because mtos are _ selective in energy , _ in the sense that the mtos of order n ( nmtos ) are shaped in such a way that the nmto basis set solves schrdinger s equation _ exactly _ for n+1 single - particle energies , which in the present case must be chosen in such a way that they span the valence band .",
    "this ability to generate wannier functions directly in real space , should be useful for _ ab initio _ molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "nmtos may also prove useful for designing many - electron wave functions , which describe correlated electron systems in a realistic way .",
    "the description of spin and orbital ordering is a trivial example . also for the conduction bands of _ metals , _ wannier - like",
    ", low - energy mtos can be designed _ a priori .",
    "_ this has been demonstrated in several cases ( mller _ et al _ 1998 , sarma and saha - dasgupta 2000 , korotin 2000 , valenti _ et al _ 2001 , dasgupta _ et al _ 2002 ) , most recently for the hole - doped cuprate high - temperature superconductors , where the material - dependent trend of the hopping integrals and their correlation with the maximum @xmath4 was discovered ( pavarini _ et al _ 2001 , dasgupta _ et al _ ) .    for a description of how we expand the charge density locally in such a way",
    "that poisson s equation can be solved and the total energy and forces can be evaluated fast and accurately , we refer to previous ( andersen _ et al _ 2000 , tank and arcangeli 2000 ) and coming publications ( arcangeli and andersen , savrasov and andersen ) .",
    "this part of the 3rd - generation computer code is still under construction .",
    "the 3rd - generation mto formalism is the multiple - scattering  or kkr ( korringa 1947 , kohn and rostoker 1954) formalism for finding the solutions , @xmath5 of schrdinger s equation for an electron in a muffin - tin potential , @xmath6 with the following three extensions :    1 . :",
    "the kkr formalism is proved to hold , not only for superpositions of spherically - symmetric , non - overlapping potential wells , @xmath7 but also to leading order in the potential-_overlap _ ( andersen _ et al _ 1992 ) . here , and in the following , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the sites which we label by @xmath10 the potential , @xmath11 is taken to vanish outside a radius , @xmath12 which should not exceed 1.6 times the radius of touching spheres . _",
    "@xmath13 for any pair of sites , @xmath14 and @xmath15    2 . : exact _ screening _ transformations of the spherical waves , @xmath16 are introduced in order to reduce the spatial range and the energy dependence @xmath17 of the wave - equation solutions , @xmath18 ( andersen and jepsen 1984 , andersen _ et al _ 1992 , zeller _",
    "et al _ 1995 ) . here , and in the following , @xmath19 labels the spherical- ( or cubic- ) harmonic s character .",
    "energy-_in_dependent mto basis sets are derived which span the solutions @xmath20 with energies @xmath21 of schrdinger s equation to within errors proportional to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a chosen _ energy mesh _ with n+1 points ( andersen _",
    "et al _ 2000 , andersen and saha - dasgupta 2000 ) .",
    "such an energy - independent set of nth - order mtos is called an nmto set . by virtue of the variational principle ,",
    "the errors of the energies @xmath24 will be proportional to @xmath25    at the top of figure 1 we show the lda energy bands @xmath26 of si in the diamond structure , calculated with the basis set of si - centered @xmath2- , @xmath3- , and @xmath27-mtos , _",
    "i.e. _ with 9 orbitals / atom , for the 3-point energy mesh @xmath28 indicated on the right - hand side .",
    "these bands have mev - accuracy for the mt - potential , which in the present case was the standard all - electron df - lda atomic - spheres potential . since three energy points were used , the mtos are of order @xmath29=2 , that is , they are quadratic mtos , so - called qmtos .",
    "the qmto , @xmath30 pointing along [ 111 ] from one si to its nearest neighbor , is shown in the ( 211)-plane by the first contour plot .",
    "this orbital is localized and smooth , with a few  orthogonality wiggles  at the nearest neighbor .",
    "the remaining three contour plots show major constituents of this @xmath31-qmto : the @xmath31-kinked partial wave ( kpw ) , @xmath32 at the central site and at the three energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 in figure 2 we show this @xmath35-qmto , together with the @xmath31-kpw at the three energies , along the line connecting the two nearest neighbors and proceeding into the back - bond .    in general , the members ( labelled by @xmath36 of the nmto basis set for the energy mesh @xmath37 are superpositions , @xmath38of the kinked partial waves , @xmath39 at the @xmath40 points ( labelled by @xmath41 of the energy mesh . in the present case ,",
    "the @xmath42-summation is over the nine @xmath2- , @xmath3- , and @xmath27-kpws , and the @xmath43-summation is over all si sites . due to the localized nature of the kpws illustrated in the figures ,",
    "the latter summation is limited to the neighbors .",
    "the @xmath44-values for which we have mtos in the basis set , we label _ active _ @xmath45 or low . expression ( [ lagrange ] ) is the energy - quantized form of lagrange interpolation,@xmath46of a function of energy , @xmath47 by an @xmath29th - degree polynomial , @xmath48 the @xmath29th - degree polynomial , @xmath49 is substituted by a matrix with elements , @xmath50 the function of energy , @xmath51 by a hilbert space with axes , @xmath52 and the interpolating polynomial , @xmath53 by a hilbert space with axes , @xmath54    as illustrated in figures 1 and 2 , a kinked partial wave is basically a partial wave with a tail joined continuously to it with a _ kink _ at a central , so - called hard sphere of radius @xmath55 .",
    "this kink is seen most clearly for the lowest energy , @xmath56 as usual , the partial wave is @xmath57 where the function of energy is the regular solution of the radial schrdinger equation , @xmath58 ^{\\prime \\prime } = % \\left [ \\varepsilon -v_{r}\\left ( r\\right ) -l\\left ( l+1\\right ) /r^{2}\\right ] r\\varphi _ { rl}\\left ( \\varepsilon , r\\right ) ,   \\label{radschr}\\]]for the potential - well @xmath59 the tail of the kinked partial wave is a so - called _ screened spherical wave _ , @xmath60 which is essentially the solution with energy @xmath61 of the wave equation in the interstitial between the hard spheres , @xmath62 with the boundary condition that , independent of the energy , @xmath18 go to @xmath63 at the central hard sphere , and to _ zero _ ( with a kink ) at all other hard spheres .",
    "it is this latter _ confinement , _ easily recognized in the plots , particularly at the highest energy @xmath64 which makes the screened spherical waves , the kpws , and the mtos localized when the energy is not too high . at the same time , it makes the kpw have pure @xmath42-character merely at its central sphere , because outside , it is influenced by the hard spheres centered at the neighbors .",
    "the default value of the hard - sphere radii , @xmath65 is 90 per cent of the appropriate covalent , atomic , or ionic radius .",
    "the kinked partial wave thus has a kink , not only at its own , but also at the neighboring hard spheres , inside which it essentially vanishes .",
    "essentially because the above - mentioned boundary condition only applies to the active components of the spherical - harmonics expansions of the screened spherical wave on the hard spheres . for the remaining components , in the present case the si @xmath66- and higher components , as well as all components on empty ( e ) spheres ,",
    "the screened spherical wave equals the corresponding partial - wave solution of schrdinger s equation throughout the mt - sphere .",
    "the small bump seen in figure 1 in the lowest kpw contour along the [ 111]-direction is mainly caused by the @xmath66-character on the nearest neighbor , and so is the finite amplitude seen in figure 2 inside the nearest hard sphere .",
    "the radial schrdinger ( dirac ) equations ( [ radschr ] ) are integrated numerically from @xmath67 to @xmath68 this yields the radial functions , @xmath69 and their phase shifts , @xmath70 each of which are obtained by matching the logarithmic derivative of @xmath71 at @xmath72 to that of@xmath73the radial integration must be performed for each potential well and for each @xmath74 increasing until all further phase shifts vanish due to dominance of the centrifugal term in ( [ radschr ] ) .",
    "the screened spherical waves are specified by a hermitian structure matrix , whose element @xmath75 is essentially the radial logarithmic derivative of the @xmath76-component in the spherical - harmonics expansion at the hard sphere at site @xmath77 of the screened spherical wave @xmath78 what is known analytically , is the element@xmath79of the _ bare _ kkr structure matrix , which specifies how the spherical wave , @xmath80 at site @xmath14 is expanded around another site , @xmath81 in regular spherical waves , @xmath82 here @xmath83 and the on - site terms of the bare structure matrix are defined to vanish .",
    "screening of the structure matrix,@xmath84 _ { rl , r^{\\prime } l^{\\prime } } \\equiv \\left [ b^{0}\\left ( \\varepsilon \\right ) ^{-1}\\right ] _ { rl , r^{\\prime } l^{\\prime } } + \\kappa ^{-1}\\tan \\alpha _ { rl}\\left ( \\varepsilon \\right ) \\delta _ { rr^{\\prime } } \\delta _ { ll^{\\prime } } , \\]]requires inversion of the matrix @xmath85 this can be done by fixing @xmath14 and limiting @xmath77 to the 10 - 50 nearest sites .",
    "@xmath86 are the hard - sphere phase shifts for the active channels,@xmath87and , for the remaining channels , @xmath88 are the proper phase shifts , @xmath89 the latter channels , which will not have kpws and mtos associated with them , are said to be _ downfolded .",
    "_ with appropriate division into active and downfolded channels , the screened structure matrix will have short spatial range and no poles in the energy - range of the occupied states .",
    "a kinked partial wave is defined as:@xmath90 y_{l}\\left ( \\hat{r}_{r}\\right ) + \\psi _ { rl}\\left ( \\varepsilon , { \\bf r}% \\right ) ,   \\label{kpw}\\]]where @xmath91 is the radial solution for the central well from 0 to @xmath92 and @xmath93is the phase - shifted wave ( [ phizero ] ) proceeding smoothly _ inwards _ from @xmath2 to the central @xmath94-sphere , where it is matched with a kink to the screened spherical wave @xmath95 the kinks of the kpw set are then given by the kink matrix,@xmath96where @xmath97 is the phase shift with respect to the hard - sphere medium,@xmath98the rows and columns of the kink matrix run merely over active channels . in the fomalism",
    "above , we have for simplicity used the notation of scattering theory , which is analytical for @xmath99 and for @xmath100 _ screened _ scattering theory with the normalization ( [ k ] ) is however analytical in a region of interest _ around _",
    "@xmath101    finally , the lagrange matrix which gives the mto set ( [ lagrange ] ) in terms of the kpw set ( [ kpw ] ) , is given solely in terms of the values of the green matrix , @xmath102 , on the energy mesh @xmath103 the hamiltonian and overlap matrices in the mto representation are given in terms of the same values of the green matrix , plus the values of its first energy derivative , @xmath104",
    "in the valence and lowest conduction bands of si , there are only @xmath2- and @xmath3- , but no @xmath27-electrons .",
    "to describe these bands , we should therefore be able to use a basis with only si @xmath2- and @xmath3-mtos , that is , with only 4 orbitals per atom .",
    "we thus let the si @xmath2- and @xmath3-partial waves remain active , while the si @xmath27-waves are now included among the passive ones , _",
    "i.e. _ those folded down into the tails of the screened - spherical waves in ( [ kpw ] ) .",
    "the results for the bands and the @xmath31-qmto are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "these bands are indistinguishable from those obtained with the si @xmath105-set , on the scale of the figure , although between the energies of the mesh , the former bands do lie slightly above the latter . however , by making the mesh denser ( increasing @xmath106 the accuracy can be increased arbitrarily .",
    "the kpw of the @xmath107-set is seen to have @xmath27-character on the nearest si neighbor , and the qmto and the kpw , particularly the one at the highest energy , are seen to be somewhat less localized than those for the @xmath108-set .",
    "it is even possible to construct an arbitrarily accurate mto - basis which spans merely the _ occupied _ orbitals , that is , which spans the valence band with a basis of merely 2 orbitals per atom .",
    "for tetrahedrally coordinated covalent semiconductors like si , it is customary to take the valence - band orbitals as the bond - orbitals , which are the bonding linear combinations of directed @xmath0-hybrids of orthonormal orbitals .",
    "it is , however , far simpler and more general , _",
    "e.g. _ not limited to elemental semiconductors and tetrahedral structures , to take the valence - band orbitals as the @xmath2- and @xmath3-mtos on _ every second _ si atom , all partial waves on the nearest neighbors being downfolded .",
    "this corresponds to a si@xmath109si@xmath110 _ ionic _ picture .",
    "this qmto - set turns out to describe merely the valence band , and to do so surprisingly well considering the fact that the two silicons are treated differently , so that the degeneracy along the xw - line is , in fact , slightly broken .",
    "the error between the energy points is proportional to @xmath111 \\left [ \\varepsilon _ { i}\\left ( { \\bf k}\\right ) -\\epsilon _ { 1}\\right ] % \\left [ \\varepsilon _ { i}\\left ( { \\bf k}\\right ) -\\epsilon _ { 2}\\right ] , $ ] exactly as for the basis with 4 orbitals per atom shown in figure 3 , because we use qmtos in both cases , but the prefactors are larger for the smaller basis : as the number of active channels decreases , the kpws attain longer range and stronger energy dependence .",
    "however , by making the energy mesh finer , the errors of the mto set can be made arbitrarily small . in the bottom line of figure 5",
    ", we show the result of such a valence - band - only calculation with @xmath112 for ge , together with the @xmath31 cubic mto ( cmto ) centered on the ge atom to the right .",
    "the accuracy of the valence band is superb , and the mto is seen to spill over onto the nearest - neighbor atom(s ) which were chosen not to have orbitals associated with them .",
    "since this basis is _ complete _ for the _ occupied _ states , we may compute the density - functional ground - state properties in _ real space _ by taking traces , provided that we first lwdin orthonormalize the basis in real space .",
    "the sum of the one - electron energies is then computed as the trace of the hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e. _ as the sum of the energies of the orthonormal orbitals , and the charge density is computed as the sum of the squares of these orbitals .",
    "this is a method where the amount of computation increases merely linearly with the size of the system , a so - called _ order-_@xmath113",
    "_  method .",
    "_ here , @xmath113 refers to the number of atoms in the system and not to the order @xmath29 of the mtos .",
    "this nmto method , which generates the complete basis for the occupied states _ a priori , _ should be superior to current order-@xmath113 methods , which either use inaccurate empirical tight - binding models or project onto the occupied states during the course of a large - basis - set calculation .    in order to demonstrate in further detail that our method works , we consider si in the diamond structure for which the valence - band wannier functions can be taken as _ bond orbitals . _",
    "first , we orthonormalize our symmetry - breaking si@xmath109 si @xmath114 qmto set . the resulting si @xmath2 and",
    "si @xmath115 orbitals are shown in the ( 110)-plane in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "these orthogonalized orbitals are seen to remain fairly localized .",
    "then , we transform to the four congruent @xmath0-hybrids centered nominally on every second si atom . as figure 8 shows ,",
    "such an @xmath0-hybrid is , in fact , the bond orbital .",
    "hence , folding all partial waves of the atoms chosen not to carry orbitals , into the tail of the @xmath0-directed orbital on one of the other si atoms , has made that orbital look like a bond orbital .",
    "the reason why the figure does not show exact symmetry between the two sites is caused by our use of an energy mesh with only 3 points in the valence band .",
    "making the energy mesh finer will generate the exact symmetry .",
    "now , sn is metal because the bonding and antibonding bands overlap .",
    "this should , however , not prevent our method from working for the occupied states only , because nmtos are _ energy selective .",
    "_ since the orbitals will be shaped in such a way that the basis set solves schrdinger s equation exactly for the energies on the mesh , we may merely have to choose several energy points in the region of band overlap _ below _ the fermi level and , of course , _ no _ energy points above@xmath116 remember that our ionic prescription does not make use of the fact that the wannier functions for the valence and conductions bands are respectively bonding and antibonding .    since the ionic si si@xmath117 set gives the occupied states in diamond - structured si with arbitrary accuracy , the same procedure with the @xmath118-orbitals placed exclusively on the anion , and the @xmath27-orbitals on the cation , will of course work for any iv - iv , iii - v , ii - vi , and i - vii semiconductor and insulator .",
    "cubr , for instance , would be thought of as an ionic compound cu@xmath119br@xmath120 with the closed - shell configuration cu@xmath121 br@xmath122 and the basis should therefore have the @xmath27-mtos on the cu atoms and the @xmath2 and @xmath3-mtos on the br atoms .",
    "this is illustrated in the upper line of figure 5 .",
    "being a single - site prescription , this works for cubr in _ any _ structure .",
    "what we have seen is thus , that the mto basis can be designed _ a priori _ to span the hilbert space of the occupied states only .",
    "that is , there is one , and only one , such mto per electron .",
    "to specify such a set , one would , in order to get the electron - count right , put the orbitals where the electrons are though to be , and leave it to the method to _ shape _ the tails of these orbitals in such a way that the basis solves schrdinger s equation exactly for occupied states of the given static mean - field ( _ e.g. _ lda ) potential .",
    "basis sets , _ which automatically span the occupied and no further states of any _ band insulator , _ could make density - functional molecular - dynamics calculations highly efficient for such systems .",
    "how could one imagine to treat a chemical reaction like : 2@xmath123 with mto bases of occupied states only ?",
    "for water , it is natural to use the ionic description h@xmath124o@xmath125 according to which the orbital configuration is o @xmath126 _ i.e. _ one would put the @xmath3 orbitals on oxygen and fold down all partial waves centered on the hydrogens . in principle , one might stick to this configuration throughout the reaction , because it keeps the electron - count right .",
    "however , the oxygen - centered orbitals would eventually look strange and have long range , because they would have to separate off pieces of wave functions sitting on the hydrogens .",
    "such oxygen orbitals might be more time - consuming to generate . at some stage in the reaction",
    ", it might therefore be appropriate to switch to configurations such as h@xmath127 h@xmath128 or h h@xmath129 for the hydrogen molecule ; this is analogous to our treatment of the occupied states in tetrahedrally coordinated si . for o@xmath130 with the _ open - shell _ molecular configuration @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 we might use an ionic configuration like : o @xmath134 o @xmath135 with @xmath136 referring to the _ local _ @xmath136-direction of the molecule .",
    "this example immediately leads to a treatment of _",
    "open-_shell systems by means of spin and possibly orbital polarizations .",
    "we have seen that the 3rd - generation mto method offers the possibility of designing single - electron bases of atom - centered localized orbitals , which span the wave functions in a given energy region of a given mean - field potential .",
    "these orbitals can even be _ symmetry - breaking _ , as in the case of diamond , si , ge , and sn , without the generating mean field having to be so .",
    "these orbitals thus seem to have great potential in the design of _ many - electron wave functions _ which describe _ correlated electron _ systems in a _ realistic _ way .",
    "we have solved the long - standing problem of deriving energy - independent , short - ranged orbitals from scattering theory ( hubbard 1967 ) .",
    "the present formalism contains exactly the right physics and chemistry, we feel",
    ". this should give the computational method great speed and accuracy , and make it a vehicle for discovery and understanding .",
