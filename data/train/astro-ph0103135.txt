    "the optical and ultraviolet emission from middle - aged supernova remnants ( snrs ) arises mainly in shock excited gas .",
    "the shocks are driven by the supernova blastwave into surrounding interstellar clouds .",
    "several lines from a range of ionization states are seen in the spectra of these shocks .",
    "the line strengths can be used to obtain properties such as the shock velocity , the pre - shock density and the elemental abundances ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a standard method of interpreting snr spectra is to compare observed line fluxes with shock model predictions , and thereby derive the shock properties .",
    "@xcite pointed out that radiative transfer in resonance lines ( permitted lines to the ground state ) was a potential problem in comparing observations with model calculations .",
    "their models showed that the optical depths of resonance lines are of order unity in the flow direction and much higher along the line of sight when the shock is viewed edge - on .",
    "they found that models which correctly predicted the observed intensities of intercombination lines in an _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) spectrum of a filament in the cygnus loop snr severely underpredicted the observed resonance line intensities .",
    "they ascribed this discrepancy to resonance line scattering in the filament .",
    "the same discrepancy between observed and predicted strengths of resonance lines , relative to non - resonance lines was found in other studies of snr shocks as well ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "resonance line scattering effects were directly observed by @xcite . in images of a large field in the cygnus loop taken with the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "( uit ) , they found that the c  iv  @xmath01549 emission was significantly reduced near sharp optical filaments , which are the locations where the shock is viewed close to edge - on ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it has been known for some time that the observed fluxes of resonance lines have to be corrected for optical depth effects when analyzing snr shock spectra .",
    "the approach towards this problem has been , for the most part , to obtain shock velocities and pre - shock densities based on non - resonance lines and then to calculate the effects of resonance line scattering by comparing the observed fluxes with the fluxes predicted by a `` best - fit '' model .",
    "that is , the resonance line strengths themselves were not used in the analysis . in one study of filaments in vela and in the cygnus loop ,",
    "@xcite calculated line optical depths from column densities predicted by shock models .",
    "having assumed a thin sheet geometry viewed edge - on , and single scattering , they found attenuation factors for several resonance lines .",
    "these values , as they point out , are extreme because of the assumed geometry .",
    "@xcite further state that quantitative interpretation of the resonance line strengths is extremely difficult because they depend on details of the geometry as well as the shock properties .",
    "resonance line scattering also affects the ratio between the line strengths of the components of a resonance doublet such as o  vi  @xmath11032,1038 .",
    "if the emission is optically thin , then the observed ratio , @xmath2/@xmath3 should be 0.5 .",
    "for higher optical depth , the ratio will increase and in the optically thick case , will be equal to 1.0 .",
    "the o  vi doublet was partly resolved in a _",
    "hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ ( hut ) spectrum of a non - radiative filament in the cygnus loop ( @xcite ) . the observed ratio @xmath2/@xmath3 was 0.6 , indicating an optical depth of about 1 for the 1032    line , and a reduction of the total o  vi flux by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "the use of this method depends on having sufficient spectral resolution to resolve the doublet components .",
    "furthermore , it has long been known from numerical models that the emission from snr shocks is highly stratified .",
    "the o  vi emission does not trace lower ionization species such as n  v and c  iv .",
    "therefore the o  vi  @xmath11032,1038 optical depth can not be used to derive the optical depths of lines such as n  v  @xmath01240 and c  iv  @xmath01549 .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a method using a monte carlo transfer code to calculate the effect of resonance line scattering in snr shocks .",
    "the effort has been motivated in part by the spatially resolved ultraviolet spectra of snrs that can be obtained by new instruments such as the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "an example of such spectra are those of a non - radiative shock in the cygnus loop obtained with stis .",
    "( this is the same filament observed by @xcite , referred to above . )",
    "one spectrum , taken with the spatial axis of the spectrograph slit placed perpendicular to the shock front , shows the ionization stratification of the post - shock gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other spectra have been taken with the slit placed parallel to the shock front at different positions , providing a map of the c  iv and n  v emission in the post - shock flow .",
    "these two lines are the only strong lines seen in the stis spectra . in order to interpret the data ,",
    "it is necessary to treat resonance line scattering more accurately than has so far been done .",
    "we base the shock model on a well studied non - radiative shock in the north east region of the cygnus loop .",
    "the shock is assumed to have a rippled , thin sheet geometry as seen in a wfpc2 h@xmath4 image ( @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the gas in the post shock flow are specified using shock model predictions ( sbrl ) .",
    "the shock model is calculated in one dimension and applied at every point on the rippled surface to generate the three dimensional density distribution . in  2 we describe the monte carlo code and then details of the model filament .",
    "the results from the scattering calculations are presented in  3 .",
    "finally , in  4 we discuss the implications of our work , and we suggest ways in which the method can be used in future studies of snr shocks .",
    "the monte carlo code we use for our simulations is based on the one described by @xcite and has been modified to run on a three dimensional cartesian grid ( @xcite ) .",
    "the code tracks energy packets as they are scattered within a density grid . for a total luminosity @xmath5 of the grid ,",
    "n energy packets are tracked over a time interval @xmath6 ; so each packet has an energy , e@xmath7  =  @xmath8/n .",
    "hereafter , we refer to an energy packet as a `` photon '' .",
    "the emissivity of a given line and the number density of the species that emits the line are provided as functions of position .",
    "the code calculates the surface brightness as seen from a specified viewing direction .",
    "the code does not treat radiative transfer within the line , instead it considers all photons to be emitted and resonantly scattered at a single wavelength .",
    "this approximation is valid for moderate optical depths where photons are not scattered out of the doppler core of the line .",
    "the code includes forced first scattering ( @xcite ) and a `` peeling off '' procedure ( @xcite ) which allows us to construct model images of three dimensional structures from any specified viewing angle very efficiently .",
    "we use the non - radiative shock in the northeast limb of the cygnus loop studied most recently by @xcite and sbrl as the physical basis for our model .",
    "the h@xmath4 emission from a non - radiative shock is due to collisional excitation of neutrals in a narrow zone ( @xmath9  cm ) behind the shock front .",
    "therefore , the wfpc2 h@xmath4 image presented by @xcite shows us the morphology of the shock front .",
    "the essential morphological features of the shock front can be captured by modeling the rippled sheet geometry with a simple superposition of sine waves .",
    "we obtained the equation for the shock front geometry by trial and error , visually comparing with the wfpc2 h@xmath4 image . with lengths in code units ( @xmath10  cm ) , the equation used is : @xmath11 thus , the shock front lies approximately in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "the physical dimensions of the grid used for the calculations are @xmath13  cm along each of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 axes and @xmath16  cm along the @xmath17 axis ( the direction of the shock flow ) .",
    "the grid has @xmath18 points , so the structure of the post - shock gas ( @xmath17 direction ) is resolved at a scale of @xmath19  cm .",
    "( at a distance of 440  pc to the cygnus loop , this corresponds to 003 . )",
    "the lines we are primarily interested in are c  iv  @xmath01549 and n  v  @xmath01240 , both of which are strong resonance lines detected in the stis spectrum presented by sbrl . we specify the emissivities of these lines and the number density of c@xmath20 and n@xmath21 based on the fiducial model for the non - radiative shock presented by sbrl .",
    "the shock has a velocity of 180  km  s@xmath22 and the pre - shock hydrogen number density is 2  @xmath23 .",
    "the carbon and nitrogen abundances are 8.40 and 7.90 on a logarithmic scale where the hydrogen abundance is 12.00 .",
    "the shock model is truncated at a swept up hydrogen column of @xmath24  @xmath25 .",
    "the shock model predictions are combined with the sine wave sheet to produce three dimensional maps of the line emissivities and number densities of the relevant ionic species .",
    "the opacities are derived from average cross sections for thermally broadened profiles . the post - shock gas temperature for a 180  km  s@xmath22 shock is about @xmath26  k , assuming that electrons , protons and ions are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "using this temperature , and oscillator strengths of 0.191 and 0.156 for c  iv  @xmath01549 and n  v  @xmath01240 , respectively ( @xcite ) , the cross sections are @xmath27  @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xmath28 ( note : @xmath30  cm ) .",
    "the approximation made in the simulations that photons are scattered at a single frequency is valid for moderate line optical depths . for n",
    "v and c  iv , scattering outside the doppler core becomes important at optical depths of about 10,000 .",
    "we now estimate the line optical depths , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the cross - section ( given above ) , @xmath33 is the ion density and @xmath34 is the path length through the emitting region . for the filament",
    "viewed edge on , @xmath35  cm .",
    "the shock models predict that the maximum density of c@xmath20 is 0.0017  @xmath23 and of n@xmath36 is 0.0006  @xmath23 in the post - shock flow . for these maximum densities , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that the typical optical depths through the filament will be smaller than these values , since the average ion densities are much lower .",
    "scattering out of the doppler core of the lines is not important at these optical depths .",
    "furthermore , the optical depths perpendicular to the sheet are much smaller .",
    "we find from the shock model that @xmath39  @xmath25 and @xmath40  @xmath25 perpendicular to the shock front .",
    "these column densities correspond to optical depths @xmath41 for both lines .",
    "photons can escape quite easily from the sheet in the perpendicular direction , making scattering in the wings even less of an issue .",
    "velocity gradients along the line of sight through the emitting gas can also lead to scattering in frequency . in our model filament , the shock is moving perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the velocity spread due to the rippled geometry is of order the thermal velocity width  there are no velocity gradients that would make escape of line photons in the wings significant . in summary , we have constructed a model filament where the assumption of scattering at a single wavelength is valid .",
    "the model neglects extinction by dust . to see",
    "if this is justified , we estimate the dust opacity along the line of sight through the filament .",
    "we assume a standard ism dust to gas ratio in the filament because the non - radiative shock has not yet had time to destroy grains .",
    "equation 7 - 23 of @xcite gives the relationship between the projected area of dust grains per h atom , whence we obtain @xmath42 .",
    "the post shock hydrogen density , @xmath43  @xmath23 is predicted by the shock model . the path length through the filament , @xmath44  cm , as above .",
    "@xmath45 is the extinction efficiency factor which is about 2 in the far - ultraviolet ( figure 7.1 of @xcite ) . for these values",
    "we obtain @xmath46 for a line of sight through the filament .",
    "even if a line photon were to traverse the length of the filament several times , the dust opacity is so low that extinction by grains within the filament can indeed be neglected .",
    "in figure  [ figmodim ] we present model images of the shock as seen in h@xmath4 , c  iv  @xmath01549 and n  v  @xmath01240 emission .",
    "each model has been constructed with @xmath47 photons emitted towards the observer ( see appendix in @xcite for details of the photon weighting scheme ) .",
    "the models are calculated for a viewing angle of @xmath48=90 , @xmath49=20  in standard polar coordinates ( i.e.  tangential to the shock front and 20  from the @xmath14-axis ) . in these images",
    "the value at each point is the number of photons detected along that line of sight .",
    "the h@xmath4 model assumes uniform emission over a very narrow zone ( @xmath19  cm ) behind the shock front and , since it is not a resonance line , includes no scattering .",
    "the h@xmath4 model image ( figure  [ figmodim]a ) shows the morphology of the shock front . the c  iv  @xmath01549 image shown in figure",
    "[ figmodim]b is what would be observed if there was no scattering .",
    "figure  [ figmodim]c is the c  iv image with scattering taken into account",
    ". figures  [ figmodim]d and [ figmodim]e show the same for n  v  @xmath01240 .",
    "we use the terminology `` thin '' and `` thick '' for the two images shown for each line .",
    "the thin image is produced by running the code , while assuming no scattering .",
    "this gives a map of the intrinsic emission from the filament .",
    "the thick image includes scattering and is a map of the observed emission .",
    "( note that the term thick is used for convenience and is not a statement about the optical depth of the filament .",
    "the line optical depth along any given line of sight through the filament can be low even in the thick image . ) the results that we present in this section apply only to the model filament described in  2 , and only for the specific input photon number and viewing geometry given above .",
    "each pair of thin and thick images have been scaled logarithmically between the same minimum and maximum values so they can be visually compared .",
    "( all the whitespace outside of the filament have values identically equal to zero . )",
    "an inspection of the thick and thin images for each line shows that scattering decreases the intensity significantly along the bright edges of the shock structure .",
    "the images also show that the n  v emission is more extended than the c  iv emission all along the front as expected from shock models ( e.g.  figure  5 of sbrl ) .",
    "note that because the n  v emission is so extended , a small segment ( at the trailing edge on the right ) has been truncated in the models .",
    "less than 2% of the total photons are lost because of the truncation and our results are not compromised .    for the selected viewing angle ,",
    "the model filament is @xmath50  cm long ( parallel to the shock front ) and @xmath51  cm wide ( crest to trough ) .",
    "the total intensity of the c  iv and n  v thick images are @xmath52  photons and @xmath53  photons , respectively .",
    "the ratio i@xmath54/i@xmath55 is the factor by which the observed intensity of a line has to be multiplied to correct for resonance scattering .",
    "i@xmath54 is 10@xmath56 for both c  iv and n  v , so the correction factors for emission from the entire filament are 2.1 and 1.8 , respectively .",
    "note that if the sheet were viewed from above ( or below ) rather than edge - on , then i@xmath55 would be greater than i@xmath54 for both lines .",
    "this is because the scattered flux preferentially escapes in the vertical , optically thin direction .",
    "the c  iv and n  v emission from the filament has small scale structure due to the geometry of the shock front and the stratification of the post - shock gas .",
    "therefore , we expect the correction factors to depend both on position and on the size of the region included .",
    "we first consider regions of the filament that are @xmath51  cm along its length and that span its width .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig50unit ] shows these regions overlaid on the h@xmath4 model image .",
    "the middle panel shows plots of the c  iv intensities of each region , and the bottom panel shows plots of the n  v intensities of each region .",
    "the intrinsic ( thin ) and observed ( thick ) intensities are shown for both lines . the position index ( along the @xmath14-axes )",
    "corresponds to the region number as labeled in the h@xmath4 image .",
    "the intrinsic intensity of both lines is fairly constant for regions 3 through 10 . in each of these regions ,",
    "the c  iv intensity is about @xmath57  photons and the n  v intensity is about @xmath58  photons .",
    "the observed intensities , which take into account resonant scattering , are significantly lower .",
    "the c  iv correction factor is higher than the n  v correction factor for every region .",
    "the correction factors in regions 3 through 10 range between 1.8 and 3.2 for c  iv and between 1.6 and 2.5 for n  v. for both the lines , resonance scattering has its maximum effect ( i.e. , the correction factor is highest ) in region 6 , where the filament is the narrowest .",
    "we now consider narrow regions lying parallel to the shock . in the top panel of figure  [ figparl ]",
    "the n  v thick image is shown overlaid with these regions .",
    "each region is 100 pixels ( @xmath24  cm ) along the length of the filament and 6 pixels ( @xmath59  cm ) wide . the regions are numbered , and these numbers are used along the @xmath14-axis in the plots .",
    "the middle panel shows plots of the c  iv intensities of each region and the bottom panel shows plots of the n  v intensities .",
    "the intrinsic ( thin ) and observed ( thick ) intensities are shown in each case .",
    "of the five selected regions , four are along bright shock tangencies ; the exception is region 2 , where the emission is more diffuse .",
    "this region has the lowest correction factors for both c  iv and n  v. the ratio of i@xmath54 to i@xmath55 for each line is 1.4 in region 2 .",
    "region 4 lies along the narrowest and brightest part of the filament .",
    "as expected , the correction factors are highest for this region .",
    "the correction factor is 3.6 for c  iv and 2.9 for n  v. the n  v emission from regions 3 and 5 are very similar - @xmath60 and @xmath61 observed photons , respectively and correction factors of 2.0 and 2.1 .",
    "the c  iv emission from these regions are quite different .",
    "there are @xmath62 observed photons from region 3 and @xmath63 observed photons from region 5 ; the correction factors are 2.8 and 2.0 for regions 3 and 5 , respectively .",
    "the intensities and correction factors presented so far are for regions of different sizes with no regard to spatial variations within a region .",
    "we now consider the spatial structure of the emission across the filament . in the top panel of figure  [ figslits ] ,",
    "the h@xmath4 model is shown , overlaid with three boxes representing spectrograph slits .",
    "each box is 3 pixels ( @xmath64  cm ) wide and 45 pixels long .",
    "the left panels are plots of c  iv intensities and the right panels are plots of n  v intensities .",
    "thin and thick intensities have been plotted as functions of position along the slit .",
    "the bright tangencies seen in the h@xmath4 image have corresponding peaks in the intrinsic ( thin ) c  iv and n  v intensities .",
    "the leading and trailing edges of the filament structure are clearly seen for all the slits .",
    "additionally , for slit @xmath65 , there is a peak at @xmath66 . as expected from the shock model used (  2",
    "; see also figure  [ figmodim ] ) , the emission peaks are more pronounced and narrower in c  iv than in n  v. the effect of resonance scattering is to level these peaks and produce more uniform emission along the slit .",
    "this is evident from the plots in figure  [ figslits ] . for both lines and all three positions ,",
    "the variation in the thick intensity across the slit is less than a factor of 2 ( excluding the ends where the intensity is dropping off to zero ) .",
    "in contrast , the maximum thin intensities along the slit are factors of between 3 and 7 higher than the minimum ( again excluding the ends ) .",
    "the correction factors for c  iv and n  v depend upon location within the slit .",
    "they also depend upon the number of spatial points that are binned together . summing up all the emission in the slit , the correction factors are as follows : ( a ) 1.9 for c  iv ; 1.7 for n  v , ( b ) 2.3 for c  iv ; 1.9 for n  v , and ( c ) 2.4 for c  iv ; 2.0 for n  v. the correction factors do not differ by much among the three slit positions .",
    "also , as in the regions considered earlier , the c  iv correction factor is higher than the n  v correction factor in each case . in figure",
    "[ figrats ] , the correction factors are plotted as functions of position along the slit for each of the three slit positions .",
    "( although the information here is available in the plots of figure  [ figslits ] , we present it separately for clarity . ) the correction factors for c  iv and n  v are most different from each other at the bright edges of the filament . when the edge is more or less straight , the correction factors are the highest .",
    "for instance , at @xmath67 in slit @xmath68 and at @xmath69 in slit @xmath70 , the c  iv correction factor is @xmath71 , and the n  v correction factor is @xmath72 .",
    "the correction factors are lower , and the contrast between c  iv and n  v is smaller on curved edges ( @xmath73 in @xmath68 , @xmath74 in @xmath65 , and @xmath75 in @xmath70 ) .",
    "the c  iv and n  v line fluxes are important diagnostics of shock properties . in a non - radiative shock ,",
    "the post - shock gas is in the process of reaching the highest ionization state it can , and so the c  iv to n  v flux ratio is very sensitive to both the shock velocity and the column swept up by the shock . for instance , in the shock model that we have used for this paper ( @xmath76 = 180  km  s@xmath22 ; n@xmath77 = 2  @xmath23 ) , the c  iv to n  v flux is 2:1 when the swept up column is @xmath78  @xmath25 and is 1:1 when the swept up column is @xmath79  @xmath25 .",
    "( the c  iv and n  v fluxes are also linearly dependent on the carbon and nitrogen abundances , respectively . ) the results of the radiative transfer simulation ( presented in  3 above ) have shown that resonance scattering decreases the c  iv and n  v fluxes significantly . the correction factors for these lines , which we have defined as the ratio of intrinsic to observed flux , depend upon the location and the size of the region being observed .",
    "these correction factors vary between about 1.5 and 6 for the cases we have considered .",
    "we can apply our current results to the hut spectrum of the filament presented by @xcite ( this is the same filament on which we have based our model ) . the spectrum was obtained through an aperture 94  @xmath80  116 , which corresponds to a linear size about that of the model filament . therefore the correction factors for emission from the entire filament , 2.1 for c  iv and 1.8 for n  v (  3 ) , are applicable to the respective line strengths measured in the hut spectrum . since the detailed morphology of the filament was unknown , @xcite underestimated the c  iv and n  v optical depth and did not correct for resonance line scattering .",
    "it is not our purpose here to re - analyze the hut data .",
    "it is , in any case , not possible to do so based on just two correction factors since there are several resonance lines in the spectrum .",
    "furthermore most of the results in @xcite were based on flux ratios rather than fluxes , and would not change drastically .",
    "our aim is to underscore the point that high spatial resolution data have made it worthwhile , and even necessary , to calculate the effect of resonance line scattering accurately .",
    "even though we have considered radiative transfer models for only one set of parameters and a single shock geometry , we can infer some general results for non - radiative shocks .",
    "for instance , when regions large enough to average over the shock structure are considered , the c  iv correction factor is larger than the n  v correction factor , but it is less than twice as large .",
    "also , the correction factors for both lines are highest at places where the filament is narrowest .",
    "the contrast between c  iv and n  v correction factors is a maximum at the filament edges .",
    "we expect these results to hold for sheet - like shock geometries for a range of shock conditions where the extent of the c  iv and n  v zones are comparable to those in the models presented here . in order to interpret spatially resolved spectra where different regions of a single filament are sampled , a model using just one set of input parameters is insufficient . even for a fixed shock geometry ( say , using h@xmath4 imaging as in the case of the cygnus loop filament )",
    ", the influence of resonance scattering on line fluxes would depend on the post - shock structure , and a grid of models for a range of shock parameters would need to be calculated .    we have been able to specify the geometry of the non - radiative filament in a straightforward way , since the shock front is smooth .",
    "in contrast , most of the bright optical filaments in snrs are associated with radiative shocks ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) and have complex morphologies .",
    "these shocks are subjected to thermal instabilities and the material in the post - shock flow is often knotty and fragmented .",
    "the monte carlo radiative transfer models can be applied to these shocks only if the density structure of the emitting gas is prescribed .",
    "the physically correct way to do this would be to calculate hydrodynamical simulations of the shock interaction .",
    "a realistic simulation would need to be done in at least two dimensions to capture the instabilities , and it would have to include cooling , which plays an essential role in the shock dynamics .",
    "we thank the referee for a careful reading of the paper and constructive comments .",
