    "it is widely believed that the universe in its very early stages went through a rapid exponential expansion @xcite . at the beginning of this inflation epoch , scales inside the hubble radius expanded , exponentially , as well @xcite . at a later time , due to large - scale cosmological perturbations with a scale - invariant spectrum , they reentered the hubble radius .",
    "this scenario on the inflation era @xcite disfavors exotic relics such as primordial magnetic monopoles @xcite , which otherwise would alter the present universe . also , it was assumed that the exponential expansion could eliminate the particle horizon and therefore helps in solving the horizon problem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the inflation scenario gives a solid explanation for flatness and homogeneity of our universe and evolves quantum fluctuations in classical curvature perturbation , as well @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that during the inflation era the perturbations started out with a small amplitude and gradually grown .",
    "this leads to a structure formation and thus even would explain the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "while detailed mechanism responsible for inflation is not well known yet , a number of predictions have been confirmed by observations @xcite and the hypothetical field inflaton @xcite is thought as a likely candidate .    according to the cosmological equations suggested by the non - relativistic renormalizable gravity @xcite , the early universe gets features that may give an alternative to the inflation . the resulting theory , known as horava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity would be able to avoid the big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "quantum corrections to gravity are conjectured to replace this singularity with an exponentially expanding de sitter phase @xcite .",
    "recently , the hl gravity is assumed to introduce possible modifications in the standard general relativity ( gr ) gravity , especially in strong gravitational regimes @xcite .",
    "this is accompanied by modifications in the gravity itself making it responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "therefore , one of the natural implications of hl gravity is on the very early universe .",
    "furthermore , various modified theories of gravity , which are successfully able to unify different inflationary approaches with the late - time universe acceleration and recent cosmological observations , can be implemented @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the early - time inflation of the frw universe might take place as a power - law accelerating evolution or similar to de sitter expansion @xcite .",
    "the earlier shall have a future singularity called sudden or big rip .",
    "when taking into consideration covariant gravity with a scalar field by an extra higher derivative term , which preserves the ultraviolet behavior of the graviton propagator , the future singularity can be cured and the einstein frame - action @xcite , where @xmath0 , with constant @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be modified , accordingly .",
    "furthermore , the presence of @xmath3-term in the consistent modified gravity removes the future singularity @xcite .",
    "the emergence of finite - time future singularities has been studied in ref .",
    "it was found that such singularities can be cured by adding a higher - order spatial derivative term .",
    "recently , the general formulas for the inflationary power spectra of scalar and tensor are driven in the presence of a scalar field @xcite .    based hl gravity without an additional scalar degree - of - freedom , a simple scenario for the scale - invariant quantum - fluctuations was proposed @xcite in order to impose inflation . for this simple scenario ,",
    "the detailed balance conditions were not necessary but the inflation scenario itself may be still or no longer needed , for instance , serious horizon problems remain unsolved , such as monopole and domain walls .",
    "they still require inflation with slow - roll conditions .    in hl gravity without the projectability condition ,",
    "the inflation regime was studied @xcite .",
    "but , opposite to the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , the linear scalar perturbations equations of the flrw universe are derived for a single scalar field .",
    "a master equation of the perturbations has been specified for a particular gauge . the power spectrum and spectrum index of the comoving curvature perturbations have been determined .",
    "it was noticed that the perturbations remain scale - invariance , and the hl gravity without the projectability condition is consistent with all current cosmological observations .",
    "this another solid support for adding scalar field(s ) .    in framework of nonrelativistic hl gravity with the projectability condition and an arbitrary coupling constant ( @xmath4 ) , the inflation was studied @xcite . accordingly , the flrw universe without specifying the gauge is necessarily flat . but by adding a single scalar field , it was noticed that both metric and scalar field become strongly coupled and almost identically oscillating in sub - horizon regions . in super - horizon regions ,",
    "the comoving curvature perturbation remains constant although the flrw perturbations become adiabatic .",
    "furthermore , the perturbations in the slow - roll parameters , for instance , both scalar and tensor are found scale - invariant .",
    "concrete tuning the coupling coefficients makes the spectrum index of the tensor perturbation identical as the ones deduced from gr .",
    "but the ratio of scalar to tensor spectra can be similar to that from gr and seems to depend on the spatial higher - order derivative terms .",
    "following this line , we apply two models for the cosmic inflation and hl gravity .",
    "it intends to find out consistency with the recent cosmological observations and the possible distinguishability from gr gravity .",
    "we shall compare between the various corrections proposed to reduce the independently coupling constants of the hl gravity theory . in section [ sec",

    "the modified friedmann equations due to hl gravity are studied under non - detailed , section [ sec : hlgndb ] , and detailed balance conditions , section [ sec : hlgdb ] and that without the projectability condition , section [ sec : wtproj ] .",
    "the cosmic inflation models are implemented in section [ sec : cim ] .",

    "starting from the dynamical variables , the lapse and shift vectors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and canonical gravity , the full space - time metric reads ds^2 = - n^2 dt^2 + g_ij(dx^i + n^i dt)(dx^j + n^j dt ) , where the indices are raised and lowered using the spatial metric @xmath7 . to explain quantum critical phenomena in condensed matter , lifshitz proposed a scalar field theory @xcite",
    "this has inspired horava to propose a quantum gravity theory with an anisotropic scaling in ultraviolet ( uv ) @xcite .",

    "the quantum gravity scaling at short distances exhibits a strong anisotropy between space and time @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dynamical critical exponent given in ultraviolet , and @xmath10 is a constant performing the scaling . as anisotropic scaling apparently implies a preferred time coordinate , @xmath11-dimensional lorentzian metric can not be the only fundamental structure on lorentzian ( pseudo - riemannian ) manifold . in order to single out spatial ( temporal )",
    "coordinates in a differentiable manifold , it was assumed that codimension foliation as a basic structure on this manifold is resorted @xcite .",
    "the foliation structure in turn fulfils local galilean invariance but also implies impossible full - diffeomorphism invariance in gr .",
    "this is recovered in some limits of the critical exponent @xmath9 .",
    "thus , gr is considered as an emerging in an infrared fixed point @xcite . to summarize ,",
    "hl gravity is a projectable approach minimizing the number of independent couplings in potential and adopting an extra principle to build the potential , i.e. detailed balance condition .",
    "the detailed balance condition is a technical treatment to further reduce the coupling constants , which would limit the prediction powers of the hl gravity theory .",
    "furthermore , it was argued that the detailed balance hl gravity has to be broken in order to enable the theory to be compatible with the available observations @xcite .",
    "a possible connection between detailed balance conditions and the entropic origin of gravity was discussed in ref .",
    "therefore , in constructing the potential , the detailed balance hl gravity can be implemented instead of effective field theory .",
    "the non - detailed balance condition was also proposed @xcite in order to reduce the number of independently coupling constants @xcite .",
    "these are likely when general covariance is abandoned @xcite .",
    "this condition assumes that the gravitational potential can be obtained from a superpotential defined on the three - spatial hypersurfaces @xmath12 , the newtonian limit would not exist @xcite , and a scalar field in uv could not be stable @xcite .",
    "the projectability condition , which is usually taken into consideration with the balance conditions , assumes that the lapse function in the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) decompositions is only time dependent .",
    "recently , hl gravity without the projectability condition has been introduced @xcite .    in hl gravity ,",
    "the general structure of the scalar field action is given by a consistent imposing of the corresponding symmetries @xcite .",

    "[ infl_ener ] motivation of introducing such scalar field was shortly detailed in introduction .",

    "<S> we study friedmann inflation in general horava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity with detailed and non - detailed but also without the projectability conditions . accordingly </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the modifications in the friedmann equations due to single scalar field potentials describing power - law and minimal - supersymmetrically extended inflation . by implementing four types of the equations - of - state charactering the cosmic background geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the tensorial and spectral density fluctuations and their ratio on the inflation field is determined . </S>",
    "<S> the latter characterizes the time evolution of the inflation field relative to the hubble parameter . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the ratio of tensorial - to - spectral density fluctuations is calculated in dependence on the spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting slow - roll parameters apparently differ from the ones deduced from the standard general relativity ( friedmann gravity ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that the tensorial - to - spectral density fluctuations continuously decrease when moving from non - detailed hl gravity , to friedmann gravity , to hl gravity without the projectibility , and to detailed hl gravity . </S>",
    "<S> this regular patter is valid for three types of cosmic equations - of - state and different inflation potential models . </S>",
    "<S> the results fit well with the recent planck observations . </S>"
