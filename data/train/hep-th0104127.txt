    "the vacuum fluctuations of the fields are one of the most remarkable predictions of the relativistic quantum theory of nature .",
    "the study of the physical consequences of the quantum vacuum on classical bodies began with the discovery of casimir @xcite . in the last 50 years",
    "the zero point energy has become a challenging subject of investigation for scientists of many branches of physics .",
    "generalized casimir forces were studied for all kind of mathematically solvable geometries , for static and moving boundaries , for hard and penetrable classical backgrounds .",
    "casimir energies were studied in the context of the bag models for hadrons , in cosmology and in the background of strong fields ( gravitational , for instance @xcite .",
    "the most complete and updated review of the applications of the casimir effect is still @xcite ) .",
    "recently some authors published works dealing with the possibility of using the casimir plates as a device to extract energy from the vacuum @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the silence of the `` orthodox '' part of the community expresses the deep scepticism on such developments .",
    "however the policy of ignoring publications does not contribute to the progress of science .",
    "discussion is always positive as long as it remains on the track of scientific argumentation .",
    "we also point out that a rigorous quantum field theoretical analysis of the ideas lying at the basis of the proposed machines is still lacking .",
    "this subject gives the opportunity to investigate the thermodynamics of the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum .",
    "more exactly we would like to address the question : does any thermodynamics in the vacuum exist ? the problem was already touched in @xcite , however always in connection with finite temperature fields .",
    "furthermore a generalization of the laws of thermodynamics has been explored in classical and quantum black hole physics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are only interested in quantum states with no real particles and set in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "the question weather the casimir effect could be used for purposes useful for the mankind is an old one and it attracts many adepts to the study of this area of physics . the author has been frequently asked from students weather the virtual particles of the vacuum stand as an infinite reservoir of energy at our disposal ( a short discussion about this can be found in section 1.3 of @xcite and in the references therein ) . with this paper",
    "we intend to cast some light into the topic and remove some superstitions .",
    "for instance it seems necessary to clarify the up to now not deeply investigated interplay between casimir energy and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this law is a classical one and a counterpart valid for the sea of vacuum fluctuations in flat spacetime is by now not known .    in the next section",
    "the possibility of treating the vacuum as a relativistic quantum gas with finite thermodynamic variables is discussed . in section",
    "iii the first and the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy for the casimir energy are investigated . in section",
    "iv a concrete cyclic machine projected to mine the vacuum is analyzed . in the last section the results are briefly summarized and discussed .",
    "quantum field theory ( qft ) predicts the existence of a constant which adds to the energy of each system of particles . in fact , the complete hamiltonian of a system reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the one particle energies and @xmath3 is the number of particles in the quantum state @xmath4 present in the system .",
    "the sign of the hamiltonian depends on the statistics , it is positive for bosonic fields and negative for fermionic fields .",
    "the contribution @xmath5 which is independent of the occupation number , is the so called vacuum energy or zero point energy .",
    "the momentum operator of the field suffers as well the presence of a divergent vacuum contribution which is independent of the number of real particles present in the system .",
    "in fact the canonical momentum operator and @xmath6 @xmath7\\ ] ] reads in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the fock space @xmath10 which in the discrete formulation , after applying the usual commutation relations , becomes @xmath11 since the vacuum momenta are isotropically distributed in all directions of empty space , the total momentum results to be zero .",
    "however the total vacuum pressure does not vanish so trivially .",
    "contribution ( 2 ) has undergone a number of different interpretations : for many it represents a mere mathematical protuberance to the hamiltonian due to the imperfect formulation of the theory and with no physical meaning . for others the second addendum in the parenthesis in ( 1 )",
    "has the same dignity as the first addendum and it must have precise physical consequences . the discovery of the casimir effect and its recent experimental verifications",
    "@xcite seems to let no doubts nowadays on the reality of the _ renormalized _ vacuum energy , i.e. small differences in the zero point energy ( 2 ) are indeed physically real quantities .",
    "however some mystery about the nature of the whole contribution @xmath12 remains .",
    "if this contribution has to be considered as unphysical on the other hand it can not be neglected in the calculations .",
    "furthermore it is unclear how the difference between two unphysical quantities and @xmath13 inside and outside a casimir cavity ] could be a physical one !",
    "the trick is hidden in the well known procedure of renormalization .",
    "still the subtraction of the poles of a function possesses a mathematical and not a genuine physical motivation .",
    "if we examine equation ( 1 ) we see that the addenda between the parenthesis are dimensionless numbers indicating the number of quanta of the field .",
    "however , while the first addendum depends on the quantum index @xmath4 , the second addendum does not .",
    "so if we have three particles in the state @xmath14 each with energy @xmath15 formula ( 1 ) tells us we have also a _ half _",
    "particle in that state with energy @xmath15 . in each eigenstate of the hamiltonian we have a half particle which is present even if the number of `` integer '' particles in the fock space is zero .",
    "this gas of `` half particles '' is the quantum vacuum . unlike the gas of fock particles which obeys the statistics ( bose - einstein or fermi - dirac ) of the field at finite temperature",
    ", the gas of half particles does not have a frequency and temperature dependent distribution function .",
    "the distribution function is merely @xmath16 . in the fock state",
    "@xmath17 only this entity , or virtual gas , fills the minkowski space . in order to give a meaning to this statement",
    "let us investigate whether in each finite volume of empty space there exist a finite vacuum energy",
    ". for simplicity let us take a slab of empty space of size @xmath18x@xmath18x@xmath19 , with @xmath20 in the vacuum of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions on the surface of the slab .",
    "no material boundary delimits this volume , what we are assuming here is that the electromagnetic waves propagate continuously all through space . the total energy present in the volume @xmath21x@xmath18x@xmath19",
    "is given by @xmath22 we regularize this expression with the help of zeta - functional techniques @xcite , i.e. we introduce a complex power @xmath23 @xmath24 for @xmath25 this expression converges .",
    "the analytic continuation to @xmath26 can be performed as follows .",
    "we introduce polar coordinates @xmath27 in the @xmath28-plane . because of the presence of the regularization parameter",
    ", the integration over @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be performed . with the use of the riemann zeta function @xmath31",
    "we obtain @xmath32 for @xmath26 , with @xmath33 , the energy turns out to be @xmath34 which it is just half of the casimir energy between to perfectly conducting plates .",
    "this means that to each finite volume of empty minkowski space it can be associated a finite vacuum energy density .",
    "this quantity exists even if no material object is put into the vacuum to perturb it .",
    "the derivative of ( 9 ) with respect to @xmath19 yields a pressure @xmath35 which is a quantity intrinsic of the unbounded volume @xmath36 as well .",
    "we find then ourselves in the situation of having two non - vanishing fundamental thermodynamic variables associated to each finite region of empty space .",
    "however these variables depend on the parameter @xmath19 , which makes them ambiguous .",
    "furthermore energy density and pressure change with the geometry of the considered volume .",
    "for this reason no general equation of state binding @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be written .",
    "we try here to extend the principles and the equations of the classical theory of heat to the renormalized energy of the fluctuating quantum fields .",
    "we start with the second law of thermodynamics . in the formulation of thomson ( lord kelvin @xcite )",
    ", the second law of thermodynamics prevents from extracting energy from a single bath of heat at a certain temperature .",
    "this would not violate conservation of energy , however , it would decrease the total entropy of the system .",
    "such a transformation is , to our knowledge , forbidden by nature . to extract energy we need at least two baths of heat which are at two different temperatures .",
    "then , energy can be taken from the hotter bath releasing a part of it to the bath at lower temperature .",
    "no matter how sophisticated the mining machine is , the ratio of the net gained energy over the total extracted energy can not be larger than the carnot coefficient @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the temperatures of the hot and of the cold bath respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath43 expresses the efficiency of a thermal machine @xcite .",
    "it also fixes mathematically the statement of the second law of thermodynamics . in a bath at temperature @xmath44 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath45 is an exact differential ( see for instance @xcite ) . ]",
    "we would like to investigate if an analogous of formula ( 11 ) exists for the zero point fluctuations .",
    "it happens that to energy ( 9 ) , as well as to the casimir energy inside two perfectly conducting plates , it can be associated a finite effective temperature .",
    "in fact the energy density @xmath46 can be given by the integral @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath49 is the so called _ effective temperature _ of the vacuum .",
    "the r.h.s of ( 12 ) is an integration over the frequencies of a thermal bath of photons having temperature @xmath50 .",
    "this means that under certain circumstances the renormalized vacuum formally coincides with a photon gas having a planckian spectrum and a finite temperature .",
    "the exact value of @xmath50 for the periodic slab reads .",
    "we have taken here one of the two positive solutions .",
    "the result which follows in a few lines is independent of the solution chosen ] @xmath51 and for the volume inside the conducting plates @xmath52 they are both imaginary .",
    "however , if one only considers the moduli of the energies on both sides of ( 12 ) , one finds the real temperatures @xmath53 @xmath54 now we want to find the carnot coefficient @xmath55 for a machine working between two casimir cavities with sizes @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "we will adopt formula ( 11 ) understanding @xmath41 and @xmath42 as effective temperatures .",
    "let us first consider the case of the perfectly conducting plates and let us take up the real temperatures given by ( 16 ) for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . inserting them in to ( 11 )",
    "we find the simple result @xmath61 using the imaginary temperatures given by ( 14 ) the factors @xmath62 simplify and we obtain the same result .",
    "furthermore , we calculated @xmath55 for the case of periodic boundary conditions and we obtained again result ( 17 ) .",
    "the coefficient ( 17 ) has to some extent a universal meaning , it does not depend on the boundary conditions , it only depends on the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "we would also like to note that an analogous coefficient must exist and could be calculated in black hole physics , where an effective temperature is associated to the mass of an evaporating singularity .",
    "we would like to make a further remark : eq.(11 ) does not depend on the kind of statistics of the considered field . for massless bose and fermi fields",
    "the energy density is @xmath63 and equation ( 11 ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy density of the hotter thermal bath and @xmath66 the energy density of the cooler one . by means of ( 18 )",
    "the carnot efficiency in vacuum can be calculated without the use of the effective temperature , by simply inserting the casimir energy density of the chosen configuration .",
    "let us find the coefficient in the case of unpenetrable spherical shells .",
    "the renormalized casimir energy for a perfectly conducting hollow sphere with radius @xmath67 is the well known @xcite @xmath68 the corresponding energy density reads @xmath69 inserting in ( 18 ) the energy density ( 20 ) taken for two shells of radii @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath72 , we find @xmath73 which is again result ( 17 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath55 seems then to be independent on the geometry of the system .",
    "equation ( 17 ) establishes a connection between quantum fluctuations of the fields and the second law of thermodynamics , giving the efficiency of a carnot machine in vacuum .",
    "the coefficient @xmath55 tell us that if @xmath57 ( i.e. the size of the `` cold '' cavity ) reaches infinity , a hundred per cent of the available energy can be transformed in to work for human purposes .",
    "however , this means 100 per cent of the renormalized energy @xmath65 confined in the small cavity and not of the huge energy @xmath74 outside it .",
    "now some authors suggested that a machine working between two reservoirs at different casimir energy densities should be able to extract an unlimited quantity of energy from the vacuum . in the next section",
    "we will analyze this possibility in detail .",
    "an important consequence of the second law of thermodynamics is that , for every transformation , the variation in entropy @xmath75 is always positive or zero .",
    "this drives the whole universe toward a state of maximum entropy determining the time direction of the events . as clausius pointed out @xcite , the universe marches toward its thermal death : a global state in which the total entropy has reached its maximum . in this universe",
    "no thermodynamic transformation can take place . in the definition given by clausius , the variation in entropy for an isothermal transformation",
    "is calculated by : @xmath76 boltzmann @xcite gives a more elegant definition , involving purely probabilistic considerations for the entropy of a system which is in the state @xmath23 : @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the number of particles of the system and @xmath79 is the probability for the state @xmath23 .",
    "it can be shown that definition ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) are equivalent . , where @xmath80 is the sum - over - states : @xmath81 $ ] , the quantities @xmath82 being the energy eigenvalues for all the different steady state solutions @xmath83 of which the system is capable . for a proof of the validity of equations ( 11 ) , ( 22 ) and of eq.(24 ) in quantum statistical mechanics ,",
    "see sections 129 , 130 and 131 of @xcite ] the author of the present paper finds of interest to investigate the variation in entropy for transformations in vacuum involving casimir cavities .",
    "we find ourself immediately in the difficulty of defining the quantity @xmath84 .",
    "in fact we do not have any heat exchange in casimir like situations .",
    "it is a very remarkable property that the walls of a casimir cavity do not transmit energy between the two regions of space which are at two different energy densities .",
    "given this peculiarity , it seems necessary to redefine the fundamental equation of the first principle of thermodynamics , which in classical physics reads : @xmath85 this states that in each system a variation of heat @xmath84 is partially transformed into work @xmath86 , while a part of it is used to change the internal energy of the system @xmath87 .",
    "when dealing with the quantum vacuum , the internal energy can always be defined by means of the renormalized ( casimir ) energy and eventually by means of the effective temperature .",
    "a work @xmath88 can always be defined when the size of the cavity is changed , therefore , we can always define `` adiabatic '' transformations , as transformations for which @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we now ask ourselves whether an energy variation can take place when the size of the cavity remains fixed .",
    "this is indeed the case when the boundary conditions are changed .",
    "a change in the physical properties of the walls of the cavity results in a change of the casimir ( internal ) energy and , if the cavity is free to expand or contract this change will also produce work .",
    "it corresponds to a heat exchange @xmath84 in classical physics .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics may then be rewritten as : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the energy expended to the vary the boundary conditions and @xmath93 is the variation in the renormalized vacuum energy inside the cavity .",
    "if we vary the boundary conditions of a cavity while keeping its size unchanged , all the energy @xmath92 is turned into casimir energy and no work is performed .",
    "we have then an isochoric transformation : @xmath94 if otherwise we compensate the variation of the boundary conditions with a change in the volume of the cavity , so that the casimir energy remains unchanged , we have an `` isothermal '' transformation : @xmath95    in full analogy with the classical theory , the law of entropy may be rewritten as follows : @xmath96 where @xmath97 indicates a kind of modified or casimir entropy .",
    "we want to study the sign of @xmath98 .",
    "we will not accomplish rigorous calculations here , we only propose an approach to the study of @xmath99 .",
    "let us first consider the spherical geometry . for dimensional reasons , a conducting spherical shell with radius @xmath67 , in the electromagnetic vacuum , has an effective temperature of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a number .",
    "let us suppose to have a spherical shell with radius @xmath70 and with a boundary condition ( a hardness ) @xmath102 on its surface which is close to the perfect reflectivity . inside the sphere",
    "we have a finite and positive casimir energy to whom it can be associated an effective temperature of the form ( 29 ) . and @xmath102 may even not exist ] we now let the shell expand under the effect of the repulsive casimir force until it reaches the radius @xmath71 . during this process",
    "a work is done .",
    "at a same time we change the boundary conditions toward a higher hardness @xmath103 , so that the two effects compensate each other and the renormalized energy and effective temperature remain unchanged . in passing form the boundary condition @xmath102 to the boundary condition @xmath103 an energy @xmath104",
    "must be expended , in fact more frequencies are trapped inside the shell and the casimir mechanism , generating positive energy is enhanced .",
    "the change in entropy is given by @xmath105 being @xmath106 and @xmath107 , this quantity is clearly positive .",
    "+ in the case of two parallel plates embedded in the vacuum , we calculate the entropy variation for the following transformation : we let two highly reflective boundaries initially at a distance @xmath56 move one toward another under the effect of the attractive casimir force and we compensate the change in casimir energy by a reduction of the hardness of the boundaries ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the effective temperature remains unchanged and we have an entropy variation @xmath109 this quantity is positive , since the work we must do to diminish the reflectivity of the plates is positive .",
    "if we let the parallel plates or the spherical shell freely move under the effect of the vacuum forces , without any change in the boundary conditions , we have an adiabatic transformation ( @xmath110 ) and the entropy variation is @xmath111 .",
    "we have then introduced in ( 28 ) a sort of entropy , which applies to quantum problems where the boundary conditions play a relevant role .",
    "we found ( at least in the above considered class of examples ) that in vacuum this quantity never decreases .",
    "the principal idea in an energy extraction cycle which adopts the casimir effect is to let the casimir force do a work and take the energy released in this process .",
    "for instance we can let the casimir plates freely `` fall '' one toward another from a distance @xmath56 to a distance @xmath57 .",
    "the plates may `` impact '' at the distance @xmath57 , where the repulsive intermolecular forces become overwhelming and the kinetic energy could be transformed into electrostatic energy to be stored in a capacitor .",
    "the stored energy is very small . to restart the process again one must bring the two plates apart .",
    "this costs an amount of work which is @xmath112 , where @xmath113 represents the casimir energy of two perfectly conducting plates kept at a distance @xmath114 .",
    "this amount of work exactly compensates the gained energy .",
    "we will now being assuming that this compensation is not due to any fundamental law of nature , but rather to a lack of our extraction device . we shall therefore consider a more complex extraction cycle , like , for instance , that proposed in @xcite . in that paper , `` adiabatic '' and `` non adiabatic '' transformations",
    "are used to form a closed cycle which looks very similar to a carnot cycle when displayed in a diagram having the plates separation on the abscissa and the casimir pressure on the ordinate .",
    "the machine proposed in @xcite uses the electromagnetic vacuum and two parallel plates whose dielectric ( reflectivity ) properties vary periodically , enhancing or diminishing the casimir force .",
    "the change in the dielectric properties of the medium is accomplished by illuminating the medium with suitable radiation .",
    "the flow of radiation through the boundaries made of semi conducting material ionizes the atoms of the medium , causing an increase in the number of free electrons and in the conductivity properties of the boundaries .",
    "we are not interested here in the details of optics , therefore this description is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "we will analyze a simplified version of the machine proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is displayed in fig .",
    "2 . at phase",
    "a two highly transparent thin boundaries are kept at a large distance from each other , so that the casimir force / energy is negligible . at a certain time ( picture b ) two suitable lamps are turned on before the two boundaries .",
    "this increases the conductivity of the medium and the modes of the vacuum will be scattered by the boundaries .",
    "previously the boundaries were almost totally penetrable and no scattering took place . the scattering of the modes inside the cavity causes the creation of stationary waves and the change of the energy spectrum which activates the casimir mechanism ; this represents a non - adiabatic transformation .",
    "the plates will attract and the vacuum will be doing work moving the two boundaries and bringing them closer , this motion represents an adiabatic transformation . in the phase",
    "c the motion is stopped at an arbitrary distance @xmath57 . in order to drastically reduce the casimir attraction , the lamps are turned off ( picture d ) .",
    "the boundaries become again almost fully transparent and they can be taken away from each other with a negligible amount of external work . when the plates are sufficiently distant the lamps are turned on again and a new cycle may start . this is an intriguing apparatus in which the reduction of the casimir potential by turning off the lamps at the stage d of the cycle seems to happen at absolutely no cost of energy . during the whole cycle ,",
    "the only energy that must be yielded to the system from outside is that necessary to ionize the atoms of the medium in order to increase the reflectivity of the boundaries .",
    "however , when the lamps are turned on at the beginning of the cycle ( stage b ) , the casimir potential is reduced since we create a negative energy density inside the plates , this should not cost us energy , on the contrary energy should be released , since the system tends toward the state of lowest potential .",
    "now , is hard to imagine how , by emitting photons , we can collect energy from the vacuum ! on the other hand when turning off the lamps ( stage d ) some external work is done , because the casimir potential is increased ( remember that the sign of the potential is negative ) , however one could hardly imagine to yield energy to the environment by stopping emitting photons in it ! to get rid of this paradox let us analyze the entire cycle again , this time neglecting all forces and energy changes which have nothing to do with the casimir effect and which certainly obey conservation laws . at stage a , when the transparent boundaries are kept at a large distance , a weak casimir force will tend to bring the potential to the lowest state , i.e. to increase the modulus of the casimir energy .",
    "this includes a weak force which will tend to ionize the atoms of the medium in order to render the boundary more reflective .",
    "no lamp is turned on .",
    "as the boundaries begin to move one toward another , the casimir force gets larger and a larger number of atoms is ionized .",
    "the decrease in potential energy is compensated by an increase in kinetic energy of the plates . as the boundaries reach the minimum distance and the kinetic energy",
    "is stored for human purposes , the potential energy reaches its minimum , the casimir force reaches its maximum and a large part of the atoms of the boundaries is kept ionized .",
    "now if we wish to restore the initial conditions and restart the cycle again we must first render the material of the boundaries transparent , to do so we have to perform work against the forces of the vacuum which tend to keep the electrons free and the material highly reflective .",
    "this is the crucial point .",
    "the work we must do to recombine the electrons with the atoms is of course larger when the distance of the plates is small and it is presumably equal to the total energy released by the vacuum during the compression phase .",
    "one may object that the vacuum releases energy in ionizing the atoms just like it releases kinetic energy in bringing the plates closer .",
    "this is indeed true .",
    "we could markedly distinguish between 1 .",
    "the energy released from the vacuum in bringing two dielectrics closer and 2 . the energy released from the vacuum to render two close dielectric boundaries highly reflective .",
    "however the humans who want to restore the initial conditions will have to do the opposite jobs as well : they will have to 1 .",
    "recombine the free electrons against the forces of vacuum , 2 .",
    "take the two weakly reflective boundaries away one from another against the forces of vacuum .",
    "the two contributions may smoothly overlap during the transformation , but the final result is the same : the energy budget is zero at the end of the cycle .",
    "the introduction of other variables in the system , like the electrostatic forces of the atoms which tend to keep the electrons bounded , or the photons of the lamp which help in the ionization , does not alter this conclusion : no energy is extracted cyclically by means of a machine mixing `` adiabatic '' and `` non - adiabatic '' casimir transformations .",
    "investigating the thermodynamic properties of the ground state fluctuations of the quantum fields a number of interesting features appear .",
    "we have studied the possibility of associating finite thermodynamic quantities like energy density and pressure , to a finite region of empty space ; this is possible by renormalization , but the thermodynamic variables depend on the geometry of the chosen region .",
    "we have also discussed the first and the second principle of thermodynamics in connection with casimir energies .",
    "we found an expression for the thermal efficiency of a machine working between two cavities confining the electromagnetic vacuum at different energy densities .",
    "we also faced the problem of entropy in vacuum physics .",
    "we defined a modified version of the entropy @xmath99 , which depends on the boundary conditions introduced in a system .",
    "we reached a result which suggests that for plane and spherical geometries the variation in @xmath99 is always positive .",
    "we note that this result is not in contradiction with nernst theorem .",
    "the latter in fact applies to the classical concept of entropy .",
    "the quantity @xmath99 not only takes into account boundary condition effects , but it picks up the effective temperatures of the bounded regions instead of the value t=0 which classical physics trivially attributes to the vacuum . the effective temperature may be then regarded to as a kind of _ renormalized temperature _ , which allows to construct a thermodynamic theory of the vacuum fluctuations . and no energy escapes the event horizon .",
    "however , when quantum effects are taken into account a finite temperature must be assigned to the black hole , which radiates particles thermally . ]    in the last section we have critically examined the possibility of extracting energy from the zero point fluctuations , reviewing the device proposed in @xcite and showing that a closed cycle with a net positive energy budget can not be realized .",
    "a casimir machine transforms into work only a small and finite quantity of energy , namely the casimir energy involved with the geometry the cavity .",
    "once this quantity is consumed , there is no way to restore the initial conditions of the cavity by varying some physical parameters without spending out all the gained energy .",
    "the hypothesis that the vacuum contribution @xmath74 , predicted by quantum field theory , is an infinite heat reservoir from which we can take unlimited energy for our purposes does not find confirmation in the present paper .",
    "we are only able to manipulate renormalized energies , which the vacuum makes us available",
    ". it may be nonetheless possible to rescue the concept of the renormalized vacuum as a kind of quantum relativistic gas pervading empty space , in this case the principles of thermodynamics seem to be still valid , when some opportune modifications are included . accepting this picture",
    "many questions still remain open , the author hopes to return on them in a future paper .",
    "i would like to thank the italian foundation onaosi for support during this research .",
