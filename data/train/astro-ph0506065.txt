    "clusters of galaxies , the largest virialized systems known , are key tracers of the matter distribution in the universe .",
    "clusters are composed of the hot , diffuse intracluster medium ( icm ) , luminous galaxies ( stars ) , and a dominant mass component in the form of the unseen dark matter .",
    "the mass ratio of hot gas to dark matter in clusters ( the gas fraction ) is believed to be a fair estimate of the universal baryon fraction ( white et al .",
    "however , non - gravitational processes associated with cluster formation , such as radiative gas cooling or pre - heating , would break the self - similarities in cluster properties and hence cause the gas fraction to acquire some mass dependence ( kravtsov et al .",
    "2005 ; bialek et al .",
    "weak gravitational lensing on background galaxies probes directly the projected cluster mass distribution ( bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) . the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz )",
    "effect on the cosmic microwave background spectrum , on the other hand , measures the projected thermal electron pressure ( birkinshaw 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , a combination of weak - lensing and sz measurements will allow us to measure directly the cluster gas fractions when the icm temperature is available ( myers et al .",
    "1997 ; holder , carlstrom , & evrard 2000 ) . both blind sz surveys , such as that to be done with amiba ( ho et al .",
    "2004 ) , and gravitational weak lensing surveys , such as the cfht legacy survey , aim to detect massive clusters of @xmath2 to study the formation of structure through the abundance and properties of the detected clusters",
    ". a comparison of the two types of survey should reveal much about the different structures of hot gas and dark matter in clusters of different mass .",
    "here we investigate this possibility using @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the lensing convergence @xmath3 is essentially the surface mass density projected on the sky , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the surface mass density of a halo acting as gravitational lens of redshift @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the lensing critical surface mass density as a function of lens redshift @xmath6 and source redshift @xmath8 specified for a given background cosmology ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "the sz effect is described by the compton @xmath1 parameter defined as a line - of - sight integral of the temperature - weighted thermal electron density ( birkinshaw 1999 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron number density , @xmath11 the gas temperature , @xmath12 the electron mass , @xmath13 the thomson cross section , @xmath14 the surface gas mass density , and @xmath15 the hydrogen abundance .",
    "note that we have assumed isothermality in the second equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : y ] ) .",
    "the presence of temperature gradients in the icm still remains controversial ( see piffaretti et al . 2005 and references therein ) . in the paper",
    ", we assume the icm is isothermal as a zeroth - order approximation ; we found a temperature variation within the virial radius by a factor two at most from our sample of massive halos ( see  4 ) .    in general ,",
    "the lensing @xmath3 and the compton @xmath1 reconstructed from noisy observations are smoothed by a certain window function in the map making process . in interferometric observations , the synthesized beam ( or psf )",
    "is well approximated by a gaussian window . in weak lensing surveys ,",
    "gaussian smoothing is often adopted to find clusters as local maxima in the reconstructed convergence map ( e.g. , miyazaki et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we hence express the convergence field smoothed with a gaussian window @xmath16 as @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is related to fwhm of the gaussian window @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , we define the gaussian smoothed compton @xmath1 parameter , @xmath21 .",
    "we then compare the reconstructed @xmath22 and @xmath23 values at a certain point @xmath24.taking the ratio of smoothed @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the _ local _ gas fraction defined with the gaussian smoothed surface mass densities . in order to extract information on the cluster gas fraction from weak lensing and sz observations , we thus need additional information on the icm temperature @xmath11 , the cluster redshift @xmath6 , and the redshift distribution of background galaxies .",
    "such information can be in principle available from x - ray observations and photometric redshift measurements of background galaxies .",
    "we can define a _",
    "estimator for the cluster gas fraction based on weak - lensing and sz observation as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the weight for the @xmath30th pixel @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , the global gas fraction of a halo can be estimated from @xmath3 and @xmath1 maps as @xmath32 if one assumes the isothermality of the icm .",
    "the case with @xmath33 corresponds to a commonly used definition of the gas fraction , @xmath34 , as the ratio of the mean surface mass densities .",
    "however , the mean convergence @xmath35 is ill constrained from weak - lensing observations : weak lensing @xmath3 reconstructions based solely on image distortions suffer from the mass sheet degeneracy ( schneider & seitz 1995 ) unless additional information such as the magnification bias is taken into account ( broadhurst , taylor & peacock 1995 ; broadhurst et al .",
    "on the other hand , interferometric observations are insensitive to the dc signal , and hence do not constrain the total flux in the field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "bolometers also suffer from a high level of contamination by atmospheric and other environmental signals , and hence rely on the differencing scheme to extract the sky signals .",
    "we therefore consider an alternative weight @xmath36 that weights high density regions more strongly than @xmath33 .",
    "then we have the gas fraction estimator of the form : @xmath37 suppose that @xmath3 and @xmath1 satisfy a linear bias relation @xmath38",
    ". then errors in the compton parameter of the form @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ) lead to errors in the two estimators of @xmath41 of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the difference between these errors @xmath44/ { \\langle}\\kappa^2{\\rangle}\\right)\\ge 0 $ ] , with equality only if variance in @xmath3 vanishes .",
    "thus the @xmath45 estimator is always better than the @xmath46 estimator .",
    "similarly , an error on the convergence of the form @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 leads to @xmath49/ { \\langle}\\kappa^2{\\rangle}\\right)\\ge 0 $ ] , again showing that the cross - correlation based estimator @xmath45 is more robust than @xmath46 .    in practical observations , noise contributions to the estimator ( [ eq : eta ] ) must be taken into account .",
    "since the noise properties between the @xmath3 and @xmath1 maps will not be correlated , the required correction is in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cor ] ) , where we replace @xmath50 by @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the noise variance in the smoothed convergence field , @xmath22 (  3.3 ) .",
    "we use cosmological simulation data by lin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to demonstrate what useful information we can extract from the cross correlation between weak - lensing and sz surveys .",
    "specifically , we simulate the forthcoming amiba experiment as an illustration of such combined surveys .      to make sky maps with realistic sz and weak lensing signals , we use results from preheating cosmological simulations of a @xmath53cdm model @xmath54 in a @xmath55mpc co - moving box generated with an n - body / hydrodynamics code gadget ( springel et al . 2001 ) , which reproduce the observed cluster @xmath56-@xmath57 and @xmath58-@xmath57 relations at @xmath59 ( lin et al .",
    "we construct a total of @xmath60 sz sky maps , each @xmath61 in size and containing @xmath62 pixels , by projecting the electron pressure through the randomly displaced and oriented simulation boxes , separated by @xmath55 mpc , along a viewing cone out to the redshift of @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , 29 @xmath3-maps are constructed by projecting the distance - weighted mass overdensity @xmath64 out to a source plane at a fixed redshift , @xmath65 .      as an amiba specification",
    ", we adopt a close - packed hexagonal configuration of @xmath66 m dishes on a single platform .",
    "amiba operates at @xmath67 ghz , and this array configuration yields a synthesized beam of @xmath68 ( @xmath69mpc at @xmath70 ) , which is optimized to detect high-@xmath71 clusters ( zhang et al .",
    "the primary beam has an fov of @xmath72 .",
    "we assume the following telescope system : bandwidth @xmath73 ghz , system temperature @xmath74 k , system efficiency of @xmath75 , and dual polarizations .",
    "amiba will operate as a drift scan interferometer to remove ground contamination to high order ( pen et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang et al . 2002 ; park et al .",
    "we approximate the resulting synthesized beam in the amiba map by a gaussian with @xmath76 , and we convolve the simulated compton @xmath1 maps with this gaussian beam to generate a set of _ noise - free _ amiba @xmath23-maps .",
    "the expected rms noise over a sky area of @xmath77 with a total integration time of @xmath78 is ( pearson et al . 2003 ) , @xmath79      we assume a weak lensing survey with a mean galaxy number density of @xmath80 arcmin@xmath81 , an rms amplitude of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of @xmath82 , and a mean galaxy redshift of @xmath83 , which are close to typical values for a ground based optical imaging survey with a magnitude limit of @xmath84 mag in a sub - arcsecond seeing condition ( e.g. , hamana , takada , & yoshida 2004 ) .",
    "the rms noise in a gaussian - smoothed convergence field , @xmath85 , is given as @xmath86 ( e.g. , van waerbeke 2000 ) .",
    "we choose the same smoothing scale of @xmath76 as for the amiba sz survey and convolve the @xmath3 maps from @xmath0-body simulations ( see  3.1 ) with the gaussian beam to produce a set of _ noise - free _ @xmath22 maps .",
    "note that the adopted value of @xmath19 is close to the optimal smoothing scale of @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) for an efficient survey of massive halos with @xmath89 found by hamana et al .",
    "( 2004 ) based on cosmological @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "[ fig : buttfly_mock ]",
    "we carried out a statistical analysis on the simulated weak lensing @xmath22 and sz compton @xmath23 maps of @xmath90 for the amiba experiment .",
    "figure 1 shows the cross correlation between the noise - free @xmath22 and @xmath23 sky maps of the entire @xmath91 as a 2d scatter plot histogram .",
    "the scatter plot is presented in units of rms dispersions @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the smoothed noise - free fields @xmath94 and @xmath21 , respectively ; @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "halo peaks with @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 at @xmath67 ghz ) are indicated in fig .  1 according to their redshifts",
    ". these thresholds effectively select massive halos with @xmath100 ( see fig .  2 of umetsu et al .",
    "2004 ) ; @xmath101 is the mass enclosed by @xmath102 with the critical density of the universe @xmath103 .",
    "figure 1 clearly exhibits different capabilities of sz and weak - lensing in cluster detections : weak lensing depends strongly on @xmath6 through @xmath7 , while the surface brightness of sz effect is independent of @xmath6 . in particular , gravitational lensing is less efficient for high-@xmath71 lensing halos due to pure geometrical effects . as a consequence ,",
    "high-@xmath71 halos tend to appear in low-@xmath3 and high-@xmath1 regions .",
    "another important feature in fig .",
    "1 is a number of butterfly - wing - shaped structures extending from the origin to points corresponding to the halo peaks .",
    "each blade of a butterfly wing corresponds to an individual cluster .",
    "hereafter , we call the @xmath104 cross - correlation diagram the _ butterfly diagram_. for illustrative purposes , we show in fig",
    ".  2 a butterfly diagram from the noise - free result for the most massive halo , which has @xmath105 at @xmath106 . the sz signal for this halo is more extended than the weak lensing signal in this cluster region .",
    "furthermore , we can see a clear disparity between the shapes of the contours in the @xmath3 and @xmath1 maps .",
    "the butterfly diagram of a single cluster shows a wing that contains rich information on the relative distributions of dark matter and hot gas .",
    "the tip of a butterfly wing shows the surface mass densities of both dark matter and hot gas in the cluster core , and the bulk of the wing reveals the degree to which the hot gas traces dark matter .",
    "the wing width serves as an indicator of the difference between projected distributions of dark matter and hot gas .",
    "most halos shown in fig",
    ".  1 have significant wing widths .",
    "these widths arise because the baryon distribution is closer to axisymmetric than the dark matter distribution due to collisional relaxation of the baryons .",
    "the local slope @xmath107 of a wing in conjunction with the cluster redshift and temperature can be an indicator of the local gas fraction @xmath108 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : y2k ] ] ) .",
    "note that the estimator @xmath109 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cor ] ) can be interpreted as a global slope of a wing in the least - square sense .",
    "we use the halo sample with @xmath110 and @xmath98 derived from our noise - free sky maps of @xmath91 to compare the halo - based cumulative gas fractions @xmath111 with their projected estimates @xmath112 from cross correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 ; @xmath113 with @xmath114 being the angular diameter distance to redshift @xmath71 .",
    "we make this comparison inside @xmath115 , and calculate for each halo a gas fraction using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) and ( [ eq : cor ] ) within an aperture of projected radius @xmath116 .",
    "we assume cluster isothermality and take the emission - weighted mean temperature @xmath117 inside @xmath115 as the observable x - ray temperature .",
    "the weight @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) is set to zero if @xmath119 or @xmath120 to exclude low - signal regions where cross correlation measurements are of low significance due to projection effects and/or observational noise .",
    "further , we remove those halos whose centers are located outside the inner @xmath121 region of a @xmath122 sky map , in order to avoid systematics in the gas fraction estimates due to the boundaries .",
    "the effective survey area is thus about @xmath123 figure  3 shows the distribution of the ratio @xmath124 obtained from the noise - free maps as a function of @xmath125 for three redshift subsamples : ( a ) @xmath126 ( where we find 8 halos ) ; ( b ) @xmath127 ( 16 halos ) ; and ( c ) @xmath128 ( 13 halos ) .",
    "the sample means and their standard errors of @xmath129 are ( a ) @xmath130 , ( b ) @xmath131 , and ( c ) @xmath132 .",
    "note that the quoted errors represent the intrinsic scatter of the estimator @xmath133 from the noise - free signal maps . on the whole ,",
    "the estimator @xmath134 for the gas fraction is close to unbiased , but there is a slight ( @xmath135 ) over - estimation bias of @xmath136 in @xmath137 .",
    "we found that most halos with overestimated values of @xmath136 are associated with mergers .",
    "the shock heating of gas in mergers boosts the temperature in the region between the merging halos .",
    "however , we ascribe the lower temperature @xmath117 to this gas , based on the emission - weighted temperature of the entire halo , and so overestimate the value of @xmath136 for the system as a whole .",
    "this overestimate of @xmath136 appears to be smaller at higher @xmath71 because such halos have smaller angular sizes and so suffer larger beam smearing effects .",
    "if the 5 interacting / merger systems in subsample  ( b ) are rejected , then the sample mean @xmath138 , showing that the bias is eliminated .",
    "such a debias should be possible based on x - ray observations of the survey field . on the other hand , the projection effect in @xmath3 due to intervening matter ( metzler et al .",
    "2001 ) also affects cluster @xmath136 estimates made using weak lensing data .",
    "this is more severe for higher-@xmath71 clusters due to their lower geometrical lensing efficiency and smaller angular sizes .",
    "if an intervening mass concentration is projected onto a cluster , then the gas fraction of that cluster could be under - estimated .",
    "furthermore , the gradients in 3d cluster gas - fraction and temperature profiles ( ettori et al .",
    "2004 ) can also induce a systematic bias in projected @xmath133 estimates , especially for spatially - resolved low-@xmath71 clusters .",
    "intrinsic gradients in @xmath11 and @xmath136 are manifest as a curvature of the wing in a butterfly diagram , and they can not be distinguished unless detailed information is available on the temperature distribution in the icm .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "( 3 ) are based on 50 realizations of monte - carlo simulated noise maps which are linearly added to the gaussian smoothed signal maps of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . following van waerbeke ( 2000 ) ,",
    "a correlated noise map of @xmath22 is generated for each realization using the noise auto - correlation function specified by the smoothing scale @xmath19 and the observational noise rms @xmath139 ( eq .  [ [ eq : knoise ] ] ) .",
    "a similar correlated noise map for @xmath23 uses the noise rms @xmath140 ( eq .  [ [ eq : ynoise ] ] ) . for a fixed halo mass ,",
    "the random error in @xmath133 is smaller for lower-@xmath71 halos with larger angular scales , @xmath141 , over which pixel noise is averaged , but systematic errors will be dominant for these clusters .",
    "by simulating the amiba experiment , we have shown that the butterfly diagram that emerges from a comparison of the sz and weak - lensing signals contains rich information on the distribution of the cluster gas fraction within an individual cluster and between different clusters (  4 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation based estimator @xmath142 should be used for a robust estimate of the cluster gas fraction .",
    "overall , this estimator is close to unbiased , but some halos show intrinsic scatter that exceeds the observational errors (  3 ) due to various sources of systematics (  4 ) .",
    "the bias for the the intermediate-@xmath71 subsample of halos can be eliminated by removing interacting / merger systems .",
    "careful selection of clusters should minimize systematic uncertainties in @xmath136 .",
    "detailed information regarding the temperature distribution in clusters , derived from x - ray observations , improves the calibration of the gas fraction estimator , and yields valuable information on the thermodynamic history of the icm ."
