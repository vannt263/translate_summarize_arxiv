    "for example , iso - structural laomnas is an afm semiconductor@xcite , and laonias shows superconductivity below 3 k@xcite . in the case of _ _",
    "tm__@xmath2co , lncoaso was reported to be an itinerant ferromagnet with the curie temperature _ t@xmath6 _ between 60 and 80 k for la and sm , respectively@xcite . among them ,",
    "the compound lafeaso , which is a parent compound of well - known iron - based superconductors , exhibits a spin - density wave antiferromagnetic transition at about 150 k@xcite . when fe is partially replaced by co atoms , the afm order from fe ions is suppressed and then superconductivity emerges , and the compound exhibits a good metallic behavior down to superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature@xcite .",
    "similar results have also been reported for co - doped cefeaso@xcite , prfeaso@xcite , ndfeaso@xcite and smfeaso@xcite systems .",
    "thus , magnetism is closely related to superconductivity in these iron - based high - temperature superconductors .    on the other hand ,",
    "the _ _ ln__coaso compounds ( also referred to as co-1111 system ) with the same space group as zrcusias exhibit rich magnetic properties at low temperature .",

    "ln__coaso ( _ _ ln__@xmath2nd , sm , and gd)@xcite undergoes multiple magnetic phase transitions as the temperature decreases .",
    "furthermore , the afm order due to the magnetic sublattice of _ ln _ ions at very low temperature can be also observed in those compounds , almost irrelevant to the doping at _ tm _ or _ pn _ sites .",
    "for example , in the case of smcoaso@xcite , a ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition occurs around _",
    "t@xmath6 _ of 75 k , followed by a fm - afm transition from the magnetic coupling between the coas layers around 45 k , and finally another afm order from sm ion forms at 5.6 k recently reported by other groups@xcite .",
    "indeed , several groups@xcite have suggested that the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interaction may play a role in the fm - afm transition .",
    "it is ascribed to the interaction between the localized magnetic moments of lanthanide 4f electrons and the ferromagnetic ordered magnetic moments of cobalt 3d itinerant electrons .",

    "meanwhile , the resistivity value gradually increases with the fe doping levels , which can be attributed to the less itinerant nature of fe 3d electron than that of co. the magnetic susceptibility for the laco@xmath0fe@xmath1aso under _ h _ @xmath2 1 koe in zero field cooled ( zfc ) configuration was plotted in fig .",

    "<S> the magnetic phase diagram has been mapped out via the measurements of electronic resistivity , magnetization and specific heat in the cobalt - based layered _ _ ln__co@xmath0fe@xmath1aso ( _ _ ln__@xmath2la , sm ) compounds . the ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition at @xmath363 k for lacoaso is rapidly suppressed upon fe doping , and ultimately disappears around @xmath4 @xmath2 0.3 in the laco@xmath0fe@xmath1aso system . </S>",
