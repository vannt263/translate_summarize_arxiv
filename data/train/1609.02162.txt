    "since their discovery , cuprate superconductors have been extensively studied by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , with many important insights . yet some issues remain unresolved , and the technique is still capable of providing fresh information on the local electronic physics in the cuprates . recently ,",
    "charge and spin stripe order has emerged as one of the crucial ingredients of the cuprate phenomenology@xcite , and nmr in these ordered phases has once more come into focus . in the yttrium-123 ( ybco ) family ,",
    "copper nmr has provided direct evidence of a commensurate charge stripe ordering at high magnetic fields@xcite , while lanthanum nmr in the 214 family ( la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 - lsco , la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 - lbco la@xmath3eu@xmath4sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 - lesco and similar ) detects the influence of stripe - related fluctuations@xcite . however ,",
    "charge stripes in the 214 family have never been directly studied by in - plane copper nmr / nqr , due to an effect known as wipeout .",
    "it has been known for a long time that in stripe - ordered lanthanum cuprates such as lbco and lesco the copper nmr signal diminishes  is wiped out  in the charge - ordered phase@xcite .",
    "the fraction of wiped - out nuclei has been phenomenologically related to the charge stripe order parameter@xcite , but without access to the disappeared signal the true nature of wipeout is difficult to ascertain and alternative explanations have been put forward@xcite .",
    "also , a marked difference between wipeout fractions in powder and single crystals is observed@xcite , as well as differences between cu and o nmr and nqr@xcite .",
    "copper wipeout is also seen in ni - codoped cuprates@xcite and la - based cuprates at doping close to the insulator - superconductor boundary@xcite , indicating a more general relationship with spin , rather than charge fluctuations@xcite .",
    "yet important insight into the stripes would be gained from cu nmr / nqr if the signal could be detected , since copper nuclei have a quadrupolar moment and the signals are thus sensitive to charge effects",
    ". a direct comparison to e.g. cu nmr in ybco could be made , highlighting the differences and similarities of charge stripes in these representative cuprates .",
    "our purpose in this work is twofold : to present an experimental methodology which enables the detection of the previously unseen cu nuclei  establishing beyond doubt that wipeout is caused by spin fluctuations  and to apply the methodology to provide insight into the ordered phase of the archetypal striped 214-family cuprate lbco .",
    "we show that the nqr spectra and relaxation times of the previously unobserved cu nuclei in lbco are indeed highly sensitive to the charge order , enabling us to draw conclusions about the structure and dynamics of the stripes and compare them to other cuprates .",
    "furthermore , the experimental modifications we employed for studying the quickly relaxing cu nqr signals here can be useful in a wide range of systems previously unavailable for nmr due to strong wipeout .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we expound the experimental methodology used in detecting the wiped - out cu signal , in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of cu nqr on lbco , including spectra and relaxation times in dependence on temperature ; in sec .",
    "iv we investigate the effect of external magnetic fields on the spin fluctuations causing wipeout ; in sec . v we discuss the results and we summarize in sec . vi .",
    "in order to detect the quickly - relaxing wiped - out nuclei in an nmr / nqr experiment , it is crucial to employ analogue signal processing electronics with recovery times as short as possible .",
    "a typical nmr / nqr experiment uses a sample coil which is part of a resonant lc circuit , a high - power radio - frequency ( rf ) amplifier to supply the pulses which move the spin system out of equilibrium , and a low - noise signal preamplifier as the first active signal processing stage .",
    "pulse powers are usually tens of watts , and the signal to be detected is many orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "hence the primary concern is isolating the sensitive preamplifier from the pulses , and if the signal decays quickly , the preamplifier must be able to operate a very short time after being overloaded by the pulse itself . in this work we employed miteq rf preamplifiers with overload recovery times as short as 1  @xmath5s , setting the lower limit for signal relaxation times .",
    "the second important issue is ringing of the lc resonant circuit after the pulses , which often completely obscures the signal for tens of @xmath5s .",
    "ringing can be suppressed in a number of ways , with several active damping schemes envisaged previously@xcite .",
    "however , most of them do not operate quickly enough for our purposes , the only possibility thus being passive damping i.e. spoiling the q - factor of the resonant circuit .",
    "yet as the q - factor decreases , so does the sensitivity of the circuit , implying that a price in signal intensity must be paid for measurements at short times . in our work",
    "this is not very problematic , since @xmath6cu is a sensitive nmr nucleus with high natural abundance and plenty of signal intensity .",
    "also , the employed pulse sequence and phasing of the pulses can play an important role in suppressing the ringing .",
    "we employ a conventional hahn spin echo sequence with double anti - ringing phase cycling , further decreasing the ringing problem .",
    "finally , the spectrometer must be capable of fast measurements after pulses  we use a commercial tecmag apollo nmr / nqr spectrometer with dead time below 1  @xmath5s .",
    "all the described experimental considerations enable us to perform a reliable nmr / nqr spin echo measurement with echo times as short as 2  @xmath5s , almost an order of magnitude faster than typical experiments .",
    "with state - of - the - art technology it would be difficult to improve on these times , and the only further possibility for detection of nuclei with spin - spin relaxation faster than 1  @xmath5s we are aware of is high - power continuous wave nmr@xcite .",
    "fortunately , it appears that in studying cuprates this is not necessary .",
    "apart from the above - described modifications , we performed a rather standard nqr experiment with a single crystal sample of lbco-1/8 extensively used and characterized in previous work@xcite .",
    "the measurements were made in a variable - temperature inset of a 12  t oxford superconducting magnet , with the sample mounted on a sapphire holder to minimize heating from currents induced in the ( conductive ) sample by the rf pulses used in nmr / nqr .",
    "spin - lattice relaxation times were measured using a saturation recovery sequence with hahn echo detection .",
    "the basic information to be obtained from an nqr experiment is the shape of spectral lines .",
    "the nqr spectrum of lbco above the charge - ordering temperature @xmath7 is well - known@xcite , and our results correspond exactly to previously published spectra ( fig .",
    "[ spektri ] topmost spectrum ) . since",
    "214 cuprates are doped by ions close to their copper oxide planes , two distinct lines are always observed in copper nqr spectra .",
    "the high - frequency signal  called the b line  is from cu nuclei close to the dopand ions ( in our case ba ) , while the low - frequency a line is from all other cu nuclei .",
    "two sets of a and b lines are observed for two cu isotopes , @xmath6cu and @xmath8cu .",
    "a fortunate circumstance makes lbco particularly suited for investigating the effects of charge order on the cu nqr spectrum ",
    "the b line is well separated from the a line ( in contradistinction to other 214 cuprates such as lsco and lesco ) .",
    "this eliminates the need for complicated spectral deconvolution , simplifying the analysis considerably .",

    "this should be expected for an incommensurate charge ordering , and is also observed e.g. in ybco at high temperatures@xcite . within our experimental uncertainty , we see no commensurate order ( which would result in line splitting , rather than broadening@xcite ) .",
    "the a line broadens as well , but its analysis is unreliable due to the overlap of @xmath6cu and @xmath8cu lines and their greater width . also , in the charge - ordered phase the a line shape appears to deviate from simple gaussian ( appropriate at 60  k ) , indicating that a nontrivial spectral redistribution takes place .",
    "this is not surprising , considering the intrinsic charge disorder of 214 cuprates@xcite and that the a line signal originates from cu sites at different distances from the ba impurities .",
    "we note that the structural transition at @xmath10  k and the associated phase separation can not be the cause of the observed line broadening , since it is known from neutron@xcite and x - ray@xcite studies that the low - temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) phase completely replaces the low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) phase within 2  k of the transition .",

    "we note that the spin - lattice relaxation curves were fitted to a pure exponential function @xmath23 appropriate for spin-3/2 nqr , without introducing an exponential stretching exponent .",

    "our investigation of cu nqr / nmr in the charge - stripe phase of lbco-1/8 resolves several disputed issues and enables a direct comparison to other cuprates such as ybco .",
    "first , we demonstrate that the wipeout effect can be eliminated if the experiment is performed with echo times short enough .",
    "we therefore establish directly that the wipeout is solely due to spin fluctuations , with no direct relation to the charge order which is static on the nqr timescale .",
    "enhanced spin fluctuations generally appear simultaneously with charge stripes in the cuprates@xcite , and their effect on cu @xmath14 is about an order of magnitude stronger in lbco than in ybco@xcite .",
    "this is in line with the increased propensity of 214 cuprates to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) fluctuations seen at all temperatures@xcite in nmr .",
    "however , the magnetic fluctuations in lbco are dynamically decoupled from charge order ( at least in the temperature range here investigated ) ",
    "charge stripe order is static on the nqr scale@xcite , leading to symmetric line broadening , while magnetic fluctuations cause relaxation rate enhancement .",
    "the possibility of a charge fluctuation - related @xmath19 mechanism is eliminated through the measurement of relaxation rates for the two cu isotopes : for a mechanism coupling to the quadrupolar moment of the nuclei , the ratio of relaxation times should be @xmath42 , while the experimental ratio is @xmath43 . yet",
    "equal relaxation times are consistent with a standard bloembergen - purcell - pound ( bpp ) magnetic mechanism with a characteristic spin fluctuation timescale @xmath44 , leading to@xcite @xmath45 where @xmath28 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus , @xmath46 the resonance frequency , and the simple form is valid when @xmath47 . since @xmath48 in nqr , the bpp formula yields a relaxation time ratio @xmath49 .",
    "we thus conclude that charge stripes are effectively pinned as soon as they appear , while the spins in the stripes remain slowly fluctuating . the glass - like slowing down of the magnetic fluctuations has been extensively investigated with la nmr , and here we see that their effect is @xmath50 times stronger at the cu sites . from the @xmath19 data we can estimate the temperature dependence of the relaxation time @xmath44 using the bpp formula above : @xmath51 , fig .",

    "the points are consistent with a vogel - fulcher - tammann law@xcite used in the physics of glassy systems , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a characteristic energy scale , and @xmath54 the effective freezing temperature where @xmath44 diverges .",
    "a fit of relation ( [ vft ] ) to the data in fig .",
    "[ t1 ] gives @xmath55  k and @xmath56  k ( a pure activational dependence would have @xmath57 ) ; while the value of @xmath54 should be taken with caution due to the limited range of the fit , it is consistent with the temperatures where cu spin freezing is observed@xcite in lsco and lesco using @xmath5sr , with the temperature range where @xmath58la spin - lattice relaxation rates start to decrease@xcite , and with the temperature where 2d superconductivity is formed through a berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless transition@xcite .",
    "the spin - order temperature @xmath59  k detected using neutron scattering@xcite is somewhat higher than the freezing scale @xmath54 most probably due to the different timescales probed by neutrons and nqr .",
    "@xmath60 shows qualitatively that a glassy description of the magnetic dynamics is appropriate .",
    "this is relevant to many cuprate systems , where similar slowing down without long - range magnetic order occurs at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "the question of spin - echo decay is also one to be discussed in light of our results .",
    "namely , the crossover from a gaussian decay in the high - temperature phase to exponential below @xmath7 we see here has been reported for other 214 cuprates@xcite and ybco@xcite , but with somewhat incomplete explanations .",
    "it is known that the gaussian decay in cuprates is generally caused by a strong cu - cu transferred coupling@xcite , and an unlike - spin coupling has been invoked to explain the crossover to exponential relaxation@xcite .",
    "yet such an explanation requires the existence of a significant fraction of wiped - out , quickly relaxing nuclei which cause the exponential echo decay of the observable nuclei . in our case of cu nqr",
    "this is ruled out , since within experimental uncertainty we detect all nuclei ( at least above @xmath16  k ) , and know that the relaxation times are more or less homogeneous .",
    "a similar situation occurs in ybco in the charge - ordered phase@xcite .",
    "hence the origin of exponential decay must be different : it is beyond this work to provide a quantitative theory , but we can attempt a qualitative explanation as follows . the spin - spin decay curve will have a gaussian shape if the transferred coupling between cu nuclei is essentially static , i.e. when mutual spin flips are rare@xcite .",
    "this happens in cu nmr with the magnetic field perpendicular to the cuo@xmath61 planes , and in nqr at elevated temperatures . yet",
    "if spin flips can not be neglected , the spin - spin relaxation curve will change . in the limit where spin - flip processes dominate",
    ", it becomes pure exponential .",
    "an _ in - plane _ magnetic field makes spin flips important and causes an exponential relaxation@xcite ; it therefore seems plausible that strong in - plane electron spin fluctuations have a similar effect .",
    "the relaxation thus becomes exponential when the spin fluctuations associated with charge stripe order occur below @xmath7 .",
    "importantly , all cu nuclei feel the same influence , in agreement with both ybco and our lbco results .",
    "we note that a redfield - like @xmath19 related echo decay@xcite can not be operative in lbco except perhaps below 40  k , since at higher temperatures the @xmath19 values are still too long to cause a @xmath14 as short as @xmath41  @xmath5s .",
    "the effects of external magnetic field are also consistent with recent results on @xmath58la , but again much more pronounced@xcite .",
    "the high nqr frequency of cu enables us to study low fields , revealing the characteristic fluctuation suppression scale of @xmath62  t for in - plane fields . in the relevant temperature range",
    "the cu spins in lbco belong to the 2d xy universality class@xcite , implying that an external field suppresses afm fluctuations by creating a preferred direction in the planes@xcite .",
    "our results are not directly comparable to @xmath58la nmr ( where only data above 5  t and at 24  k are available ) , but the same tendency is observed there .",
    "importantly , the in - plane field effectively decreases the spin - spin relaxation rate and thus modifies wipeout , in agreement with cu nqr wipeout measurements on lesco-1/8 crystals@xcite .",
    "all these observations are a consequence of the same suppression effect , and our cu measurements here show that it is still present at fields as low as @xmath62  t in the charge - ordered phase above the spin - ordering temperature @xmath12  k.    we see no significant differences between a and b sites in either relaxations or static nqr lineshapes , demonstrating ( i ) that the magnetic fluctuations are insensitive to barium impurities and ( ii ) that charge stripes are not pinned to the ba local fields .",
    "the latter conclusion agrees with scattering studies , which show that stripes are pinned to orthorhombic twin boundaries@xcite in lsco . yet in contrast to scattering methods , the cu nqr lineshape provides a microscopic measure of the amplitude of the charge modulation . the relative linewidth change of the cu b line in lbco at 40  k is @xmath63 , and can be extrapolated to @xmath64 at 0  k ( assuming that the linewidth follows the x - ray charge order parameter in the entire temperature range ) .",
    "this is about 2 times larger than the charge - stripe induced cu nmr line splitting@xcite in ybco-0.108  the values are probably even closer at doping 1/8 where the splitting in ybco is expected to be the largest@xcite , but a direct comparison to ybco-1/8 is not available due to the complicated cu nmr spectra .",
    "furthermore , the cu linewidth change in lbco is similar to the @xmath65o quadrupolar line broadening / shift in ybco-1/8 [ ] and lesco [ ] .",
    "this indicates that the amplitude of charge modulation in the cuprates is universal , i.e. does not significantly depend on the material family .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by resonant soft x - ray diffractionpuniversalx .",
    "in contrast , the accompanying magnetic fluctuations are strongly family - dependent , suggesting that charge order is an intrinsic feature of the cuo@xmath61 planes around 1/8 doping , with the strength of associated spin fluctuations determined by the underlying afm tendencies of the family .",
    "to conclude , we present the first cu nqr / nmr investigation of charge - stripe ordered lbco-1/8 which eliminates the wipeout effect , thus enabling insight into the microscopic physics of charge stripes and associated magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we find that the charge stripes are static on the nmr scale @xmath66  @xmath5s as soon as they appear , and that the charge modulation amplitude can be reliably determined from cu nqr linewidth .",
    "a comparison to results on other cuprates indicates that the relative amplitude is universal in the cuprates .",
    "strong spin fluctuations accompany the charge order , and evidence for glassy spin dynamics / spin freezing is obtained from cu nuclear spin relaxation measurements , corroborating previous @xmath58la nmr studies .",
    "the magnetic fluctuations also cause the apparent cu signal wipeout by making the relaxation times significantly shorter than the typical nmr measurement times .",
    "our fast spin echo experiment provides a way to detect the quickly - relaxing nuclei and avoid wipeout , and could thus be relevant for measuring previously unseen nmr / nqr signals in a wide class of materials where strong spin fluctuations appear ."
