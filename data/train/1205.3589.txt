    "the parametrization of coupled beam motion has been studied intensively over the past decades .",
    "nevertheless , there is still no representation of general coupled motion that would be as complete and as widely accepted as the 1d courant - snyder theory .",
    "but is it really so , that the courant - snyder theory is , essentially , the theory which is applicable only to the 1d linear motion ?",
    "our answer is that the one - dimensionality of motion is not the main source of the elegance of the courant - snyder approach .",
    "it is the property of the beam matrix to be proportional to the matrix which is simultaneously symmetric positive definite and symplectic .",
    "because this property is independent from the phase space dimensions and is the characteristic property of the particle beams with equal eigenemittances , the purpose of this paper is to show that the 1d courant - snyder theory can be considered as a natural partial case of the multidimensional theory of coupled particle beams with equal eigenemittances .",
    "it is also possible to say ( in the opposite way ) , that in this paper we extend the 1d courant - snyder formalism to the multidimensional theory of beams with equal eigenemittances . due to space limitation",
    ", we consider only the most basic theoretical questions and the more detailed study will be presented in a separate publication .",
    "let us consider a collection of points in @xmath0-dimensional phase space ( a particle beam ) and let , for each particle ,    @xmath1    be a vector of canonical coordinates and momenta .",
    "then , as usual , the beam ( covariance ) matrix is defined as    @xmath2    where the brackets @xmath3 denote an average over a distribution of the particles in the beam and @xmath4 submatrices of the @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 satisfy    @xmath7    one says that the beam is uncoupled if all four submatrices of the matrix @xmath6 are diagonal matrices . by definition ,",
    "the matrix @xmath6 is symmetric positive semidefinite and in the following we will restrict our considerations to the situation when this matrix is nondegenerated and therefore positive definite . for simplification of notations and without loss of generality",
    ", we will also assume that the beam has vanishing first - order moments , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the independent variable ( time or path length along design orbit ) and let @xmath10 be the linear transfer matrix which propagates particle coordinates from the state @xmath11 to the state @xmath12 , i.e let    @xmath13    then the beam matrix @xmath6 evolves between these two states according to the rule    @xmath14    if the matrix @xmath15 is symplectic and satisfies the relations    @xmath16    where    @xmath17    is the @xmath18 symplectic unit matrix and @xmath19 is the @xmath20 identity matrix , then the transport equation ( [ intr_5 ] ) can be transformed into the following equivalent form    @xmath21    from this form of the equation ( [ intr_5 ] ) we see that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath22 are invariants , because ( [ vectz_7 ] ) is a similarity transformation .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 is nondegenerated and is similar to the skew symmetric matrix @xmath23    @xmath24    which means that its spectrum is of the form    @xmath25    where all @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the imaginary unit .",
    "the quantities @xmath28 are called eigenemittances and are generalizations of the usual 1d rms emittances    @xmath29    to the fully coupled case  @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the set of all eigenemittances @xmath30 and the set of all projected emittances @xmath31 of a given beam matrix @xmath6 coincide if and only if the beam is uncoupled .",
    "the other approach to the concept of eigenemittances is the way pointed out by williamson s theorem ( see , for example , references in  @xcite ) .",
    "this theorem tells us that one can diagonalize any positive definite symmetric matrix @xmath6 by congruence using a symplectic matrix @xmath32    @xmath33    and that the diagonal matrix @xmath34 has the very simple form    @xmath35    where the diagonal elements @xmath28 are the moduli of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath22 .",
    "the matrix @xmath32 in ( [ a2_1 ] ) is not unique , but the diagonal entries of the williamson s normal form @xmath34 ( eigenemittances ) are unique up to a reordering .",
    "let us assume that the beam matrix @xmath6 has all eigenemittances equal to each other and equal to the value @xmath36 . then , according to the williamson s theorem , there exists a symplectic matrix @xmath32 such that    @xmath37    the matrix @xmath38 in ( [ matr_s2 ] ) is independent from any particular choice of the diagonalizing matrix @xmath32 in ( [ a2_1 ] ) and is simultaneously symmetric positive definite and symplectic .",
    "we will call it the twiss matrix and will parametrize it as follows    @xmath39    where the @xmath20 submatrices @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the natural matrix generalizations of the corresponding 1d scalar twiss parameters .",
    "due to symplecticity of the matrix @xmath38 the matrix twiss parameters satisfy the relations    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    because the matrix @xmath38 is positive definite , both its submatrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 are also positive definite and , therefore , nondegenerated . from this",
    "it follows that not all relations ( [ betas_4])-([betas_7 ] ) are independent . for example",
    ", the relations ( [ betas_5 ] ) or the relations ( [ betas_7 ] ) can be omitted .",
    "the inverse of the twiss matrix @xmath38 is given by the formula    @xmath48    and , therefore , the natural multidimensional analogy of the positive definite 1d courant - snyder invariant    @xmath49    can be written as follows    @xmath50    in general , the eigenemittances of the matrix @xmath6 have to be found as solution of the eigenvalue problem for the matrix @xmath22 .",
    "but if one wants only to know if all of them are equal to each other or not , then the solution of the eigenvalue problem is not necessary .",
    "it can be done by simple matrix multiplication as explained in the following proposition .",
    "the beam matrix @xmath6 has all eigenemittances equal to each other and equal to the value @xmath36 if and only if the equality    @xmath51    holds , i.e. if and only if the matrix @xmath52 is a negative scalar matrix .",
    "due to nonuniques of the diagonalizing matrix @xmath32 in the williamson s theorem the relation ( [ matr_s2 ] ) can be considered as a multi - valued function which maps any particular matrix @xmath6 ( and/or @xmath38 ) into some subset of symplectic matrices .",
    "let us select some single - valued branch of this function which associates one , and only one , output to any particular input .",
    "we will call any such branch as @xmath32-algorithm and the examples of the @xmath32-algorithms will be given below .",
    "so , let us fix some particular @xmath32-algorithm and let us substitute the representation ( [ matr_s2 ] ) into the equation ( [ intr_5 ] ) . then ,",
    "after some straightforward manipulations , we obtain                        although the motion in the normalized variables ( [ tp_7 ] ) is not , in general , uncoupled motion , but from the point of view of the theory of beams with equal eigenemittances no additional simplifications are required , because        let us turn now our attention to the concept of phase advances , which does not have an unique choice even in the 1d case ( see , for example , discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "the phase advances are the quantities which should be associated with the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath61 .",
    "this matrix is orthosymplectic and can be partitioned into the form                if the beam transport in ( [ intr_5 ] ) is periodic ( i.e. if @xmath69 and , therefore , @xmath70 ) , then the equality ( [ tp_4 ] ) tells us that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath66 are the same as the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "it means that for the periodic beam transport the phase advances are uniquely defined independently from any particular choice of the @xmath32-algorithm .",
    "it is a very pleasant property , but it seems that it is the only property of the phase advances which does not depend from the choice of the @xmath32-algorithm . let us , for illustration , consider three 1d @xmath32-algorithms defined by the requirement for the matrix @xmath32 in ( [ matr_s2 ] ) to be in one of the following special forms        note that here @xmath73 is the original courant - snyder choice and @xmath74 is symmetric ( and symplectic ) positive definite square root of the matrix @xmath75 . in all these cases",
    "the matrix @xmath76 in ( [ tp_4 ] ) is given by                one sees that while @xmath82 stays constant in the drift spaces , @xmath83 and @xmath84 change ; while @xmath83 changes monotonously , @xmath82 and @xmath84 can be locally increasing and decreasing ; and etc . besides that , let us note that the multiplication of any matrix @xmath85 from the left by a constant rotation matrix does not change the corresponding phase advance .",
    "for example , for an arbitrary constant angle @xmath86 the @xmath32-algorithm associated with the matrix      will produce the same phase advance as in the original courant - snyder case , but , in general , the triangular form of the transition to the normalized variables ( [ tp_6 ] ) , which is also important for 1d theory , will be lost .",
    "so , it seems that the correct way to extend the courant - snyder choice of the 1d phase advance to the multidimensional case without losing what else important comes through the direct generalization of the 1d @xmath32-algorithm defined by the matrix @xmath73 to many dimensions .        where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are , respectively , a symmetric and an invertible @xmath20 matrix .",
    "note that any lower block triangular symplectic matrix can be represented in this form with the proper choice of the matrices @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this proposition tells us that though not only @xmath6 matrices with equal eigenemittances can be diagonalized by the matrix ( [ a2_3 ] ) , the consistent theory of diagonalization by the lower block triangular symplectic matrices can be created only for the beams with equal eigenemittances .",
    "substituting representation ( [ a2_3 ] ) into relation ( [ matr_s2 ] ) we obtain the following equations for the determination of the matrices @xmath90 and @xmath89 as functions of the given matrix twiss parameters @xmath46 , @xmath41 and @xmath47          the general solution of the equation ( [ tp_1_1 ] ) can be written as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is any particular solution of this equation and @xmath97 is an arbitrary @xmath20 orthogonal matrix .",
    "when some solution of the equation ( [ tp_1_1 ] ) is chosen , then the matrix @xmath89 is uniquely defined from the equation ( [ tp_1_2 ] ) and is symmetric , and the equation ( [ tp_1_3 ] ) is satisfied automatically due to relation ( [ betas_4 ] ) .",
    "thus the only remaining uncertainty in the choice of the @xmath32-algorithm lies in the nonuniques of the solution of equation ( [ tp_1_1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this uncertainty can not be resolved simply by the requirement to recover the courant - snyder choice in the limit of multidimensional uncoupled beams .",
    "for example , both , @xmath90 taken as unique cholesky factor of the matrix @xmath46 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 denotes an unique positive definite symmetric square root of the matrix @xmath46 , will satisfy this requirement .",
    "but if we will take into account that the courant - snyder matrix @xmath73 has positive diagonal elements and will reformulate this property in the form that @xmath100 diagonal submatrices of the matrix @xmath73 are symmetric positive definite matrices ,",
    "then the choice for @xmath90 becomes unique .",
    "one takes @xmath101 and obtains for the matrix @xmath32 the final ( and familiar from 1d theory ) form"
