    "massive stars play a key role in the evolution of the universe .",
    "they are the principal source of heavy elements and uv radiation . through a combination of winds , massive outflows , expanding hii regions , and supernova explosions they provide an important source of mixing and turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies .",
    "turbulence in combination with differential rotation drives galactic dynamos .",
    "galactic magnetic fields are generated , interacting with supernova shock fronts that accelerate cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic rays , uv radiation , and dissipation of turbulence are the principal sources of heating in the ism , whereas heavy elements found in dust , molecules , and in atomic / ionic form ultimately are responsible for its cooling .",
    "massive stars thus profoundly affect the star- and planet - formation process ( bally , moeckel & throop 2005 ) as well as the physical , chemical , and morphological structure of galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 , 2005 ) .    in spite of the dominant role that massive stars play in shaping galactic structure and evolution , our understanding of their formation and early evolution is still sketchy .",
    "there are many reasons .",
    "high dust extinction makes it difficult to observe high - mass stars during critical early formation phases .",
    "they are rare .",
    "they evolve quickly and important evolutionary phases are short - lived .",
    "the theoretical problem is extremely complex .",
    "finally , massive stars are seldomly ( if at all ) formed in isolation ; the proximity of other high - mass stars compounds the complex influence of the forming star on its local environment via gravitational interactions , powerful outflows and winds , ionizing radiation , and supernovae .    the low number statistics of young or forming high - mass stars is only partially offset by their higher luminosities , which allow us to study them at greater distances than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "however , insufficient spatial resolution is an issue  an entire ob - star cluster is often contained in a single observing pixel ( e.g. , henning & stecklum 2002 ) .",
    "star formation typically starts with a collapsing gas condensation ( core ) inside a larger subunit ( clump ) of a molecular cloud ( cf .",
    "williams , blitz & mckee 2000 ) .",
    "a protostar forms that increases its mass by accretion ( accumulation ) of neighboring gas , while at the same time some mass loss occurs through a bipolar outflow and/or a collimated jet .",
    "let us define some of the terminology adopted here .",
    "one of the most misused terms in papers dealing with star formation is protostar , which is considered the holy grail ( wynn - williams 1982 ) of ir astronomy . here , we reserve the term protostar or protostellar object for a gaseous object in hydrostatic equilibrium ( gas pressure forces balance the gas self - gravity ) , which has not yet begun hydrogen burning but which will , given time , burn hydrogen . at",
    "the point hydrogen burning commences , we shall speak of a zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) star ; as long as hydrogen burning occurs in the center , we shall speak of a main - sequence star .",
    "note that the size scale of a protostar is at most a few tens of solar radii .",
    "we use the terms massive star and high - mass star interchangeably to denote an ob star sufficiently massive to produce a type ii supernova ( @xmath08 for solar abundances ) . with these definitions in mind ,",
    "the term high - mass protostar denotes a @xmath18m@xmath2 hydrostatic object that has not yet begun hydrogen burning .",
    "as we shall see in the following , such objects exist only briefly during a transitory stage between `` accreting intermediate - mass protostar '' and `` accreting high - mass star . '' because it will be impossible to distinguish observationally when an accreting object begins burning hydrogen , we suggest that the terms massive protostar and high - mass protostar generally be avoided .    in * table  1 * , we give a crude classification of massive stars in terms of logarithmic mass intervals and the corresponding main sequence spectral types .",
