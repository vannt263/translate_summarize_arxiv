    "x - ray novae ( xn ) , also called soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , are binary x - ray sources that show outburst behavior @xcite . the prevailing theory for their transient behavior is based on the disk instability model ( dim ) first proposed to explain dwarf novae outbursts ( see the extensive review by @xcite ) . applying this model to xn",
    "requires significant modifications due to x - ray irradiation from the central disk and the disruption of the inner disk , presumably by an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , in quiescence .",
    "the dim with these modifications is shown to be quite successful in modeling transient outbursts similar to the canonical xn a0620@xmath100 @xcite . however , it is also clear that some sources undergo outbursts that are very difficult to reconcile with the dim . in this paper",
    "we consider one such source , xtej1118 + 480 , and develop an alternative model for the outburst based on modulated mass transfer into the outer disk , rather than a sudden increase in viscosity in a pre - existing disk as in the dim .",
    "we derive a general prescription for calculating x - ray outburst light curves based on a diffusion propagation model in the disk .",
    "we begin with the same basic diffusion equations as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bp81 ) but we derive an analytical solution rather than solving the equations numerically .",
    "we derive a green s function from the first outburst and develop a deconvolution technique to calculate the mass input rate as a function of time for the second outburst .",
    "this allows us to derive the time evolution of the mass of the disk for the second outburst .",
    "based on the global oscillation model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter to00 ) we expect the qpo to correlate inversely with the disk mass .",
    "this provides us with at least one observational test for the model .",
    "it is possible that this model may be applicable to outbursts observed in other sources as well .",
    "@xcite point out similarities among five xne : groj0422 + 32 , xtej1118 + 480 , x1354 - 644 , groj1719 - 24 , and gs2023 + 338 .",
    "all five have had at least one outburst in which the source remains in the low - hard state through the entire episode . in three instances a @xmath2",
    "hz qpo drifting persistently upward in frequency is seen .",
    "these sources may be good candidates for future tests of this model ; however , in this paper we limit ourselves to xtej1118 + 480 as an example .",
    "in section  [ sec - source ] we review the properties of the source , particularly the features of the 2000 outburst which are difficult to account for in the dim . in section  [ sec - diff ]",
    "we describe the main features of the diffusion model . in section  [ sec - solve ]",
    "we solve for the green s funtion for the specific case where @xmath3 and in the general case . in section  [ sec - inverse ] we derive the deconvolution procedure to get the accretion rate into the disk and the time evolution of the disk mass during the outburst .",
    "we apply the full procedure to the data on xtej1118 + 480 in section  [ sec - data ] . in section  [ sec - observe ]",
    "we show that this model can explain the time evolution of the low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) seen during most of the outburst .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec - discussion ] with a discussion of the successes and limitations of this model .",
    "xtej1118 + 480 is a black hole ( bh ) transient that was observed from radio to hard x - rays during 2000 january to august .",
    "optical observations after the source returned to quiescence confirmed the black hole nature of the compact object by measuring a mass function of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this is among the highest mass functions measured for any transient .",
    "in addition , the combination of the small distance to the source ( @xmath5 kpc ; @xcite ) and the high galactic latitude ( @xmath6 ) results in this source having the lowest reddening of any xn .",
    "the x - ray light curve of the source is peculiar , with an unusual _ double _ outburst ( see figure  [ fig - data ] ) .",
    "the first outburst appears to have a fast rise followed by an exponential decay ( fred morphology ) , but the second outburst is irregular with multiple maxima .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was essentially constant as an absorbed power law with photon spectral index of 1.73 @xcite , typical of the low / hard state of black holes .",
    "a radio counterpart at 5 ghz has been detected during outburst , although jets were not directly resolved with merlin to a limit of @xmath7 ( @xmath8/kpc ) au @xcite .",
    "an earlier paper @xcite reported detailed evolution of the 0.1 hz qpo , using x - ray data from the usa experiment and _ rxte_. the qpo frequency increased monotonically from 0.07 to 0.15 hz over @xmath9 months , failing to correlate with the x - ray luminosity which rises and falls over the same interval . in this paper , we explore using the disk mass rather than usual quantities ( such as luminosity or spectral parameters ) to correlate with the drifting qpo frequency . the low ( @xmath0 hz ) frequency suggests an origin at a large radius in the disk because dynamical timescales scale roughly with the kepler frequency .",
    "one theory that could explain such a low - frequency qpo is the global oscillation model of to00 .",
    "their model describes a large - scale coherent oscillation in the outer disk , linking qpo issues to those of overall disk structure .",
    "the model leads to a bh mass estimate for xtej1118 + 480 of @xmath10 based on the @xmath0 hz qpo frequency , in agreement with recent optical data @xcite which suggest a bh mass range of 6.07.7 @xmath11 .",
    "( we note that there is a typographical error in equation ( 14 ) of to00 which should have @xmath12 instead of @xmath13 . )",
    "the same qpo was seen in euv and optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the double outburst profile of this source is difficult to account for in the standard dim .",
    "if an outburst is triggered by a sudden increase in disk viscosity and leads to the fred - type outburst in 2000 january , how can another outburst , with five times the fluence , occur so shortly afterwards ?",
    "what mechanism turns off the first outburst ? and , why does the second outburst have such an irregular shape ? if the instability is triggered at some maximum value of the disk mass , and the amount of mass consumed in the first outburst was replenished in @xmath14 days , then the mass consumed in the second outburst should be replenished at about 0.5 years .",
    "thus , the dim models would have predicted that another outburst should have occurred by now .",
    "our alternative model is that the outbursts were fueled by sporadic mass transfer from the companion rather than from a large amount of mass stored in the disk during quiescence .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the current paper to develop the dynamics of the mass transfer which accounts for this behavior .",
    "it is instructive to look at the energetics of the outburst .",
    "the luminosity of the long outburst was about @xmath15 erg / s ( for a distance of 1.8 kpc ) which is only @xmath16 ( for an assumed black hole mass of @xmath17 ) , whereas the canonical dim outbursts approach the eddington limit at their peak .",
    "mass transfer modulation models for xn outbursts have previously been considered as viable alternatives to the dim . as",
    "the xtej1118 + 480 outbursts are not easily reconciled with the standard dim , it seems reasonable to develop a different model for this source .",
    "for example , @xcite has suggested that the long outburst of xtej1118 + 480 is a superoutburst of the type seen in the su uma class of cataclysmic variables @xcite , based on striking similarities in the x - ray and optical lightcurves and the appearance of superhumps . to account for some of the unusual aspects of xtej1118 + 480 , here",
    "we investigate an alternative model where the outburst is driven by mass transfer from the companion and the diffusive propagation of material in the disk .",
    "we now derive the main equation describing diffusive propagation of matter in the disk . using the angular momentum balance [ e.g. @xcite , see also @xcite hereafter ( to99 ) , eq .",
    "4 ] @xmath18 and the continuity equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass accretion in the disk and mass accretion input over the disk at the given radius @xmath22 and at the given time @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the @xmath25component of a viscous stress tensor @xmath26 . we can get a relation between @xmath24 and the surface density @xmath27 using equation ( 5 ) in to99 with an assumption that the rotational frequency is equal to the keplerian one , @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a half - thickness of a disk , @xmath31 is the gravitational constant , @xmath32 is the mass of the central object , @xmath33 is a viscosity , @xmath34 is the density , @xmath35 is a kinematic viscosity in the disk and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the turbulent scale and velocity in the disk respectively .",
    "we also use the relation @xmath38 .",

    "it is worth noting that the derivation presented here and bp81 is general , using only the mass and angular momentum conservations and an assumption of kepler rotational velocity in the disk .",
    "it does not invoke specific assumptions regarding the structure of the disk .",
    "the viscosity value , @xmath43 implemented for calculation of @xmath24 in equation ( 3 ) are averaged over the vertical size of the disk .",
    "the product of @xmath44 is in fact an integral of the density , @xmath34 , over the @xmath45coordinate , yielding a surface density @xmath40 .",
    "in our calculation we will assume that the mass accretion input ( presumably from the companion ) occurs at the outer boundary of the disk at @xmath46 , namely @xmath47 thus , @xmath48 is the mass input rate as a function of time at the outer edge of the disk . using equations ( 2 ) and ( 6 ) we derive the differential equation for the disk mass @xmath49 : @xmath50 where mass accretion @xmath51 at the inner disk boundary can be calculated using equation ( 4 ) .",

    "an important consequence of the previous derivation is that the fred outburst shape is a natural consequence of the diffusion model .",
    "the exponential decay is due to diffusion in a bounded medium , while the fast rise is due to the fact that the probe ( x - ray emission from the inner edge of the disk ) is located at a distance from the source ( accreting material added to the outer edge of the disk ) .",

    "this result is a consistency check of the convolution model for the second outburst .",
    "in fact , for any input function @xmath48 whose support is much larger than that of the green s function @xmath101 , the shape of the convolution ( eq . [ 63 ] ) begins with the integral of @xmath101 multiplied by the initial value of @xmath48 .",
    "this property of the convolution is a useful tool to distinguish the convolution model of the outburst from other possible models .",

    "despite the fact that the computed evolution of the disk mass looks very similar to the evolution of the x - ray luminosity , the two curves are not identical . the disk mass evolution is obtained from the light curve by the transformation which is effectively a shift transformation .",
    "while figure  [ fig - m ] is not yet a complete model of the qpo evolution , we argue that it represents a very substantial advance over what was previously available . to date",
    "there has been no model which successfully explains the evolution of this low - frequency qpo .",

    "it fails completely to correlate with x - ray luminosity in the sense that @xmath204 rises and falls while qpo rises monotonically .",
    "the function @xmath211 , while not perfect , moves the turnover earlier than that seen for @xmath204 and hence closer to that observed in the qpo frequency history .",
    "we believe that this result , combined with a physical model for the qpo evolution represents a significant improvement in our understanding of the observed qpo .",
    "note that our model included several simplifying assumptions which when corrected may account for the remaining differences .",
    "we may now reconsider the global oscillation model ( to00 , ) in which a monotonic dependence of @xmath212 on the qpo frequency @xmath213 is derived , giving @xmath214 ( see eqs .",
    "[ 4 , 7 ] there ) .",
    "the observed dependence is flatter than the predicted one ; that discrepancy could be a result of our assumption of constant conversion efficiency @xmath215 of the mass accretion rate ( in fact , the surface density ) at the inner disk edge into x - ray luminosity .",
    "it is possible that the inner radius of the disk changes along with the outer disk radius , causing the variation of @xmath215 .    the global oscillation is a vertical displacement of a large portion of the disk .",
    "the exact mechanism whereby this modulates x - ray ( as well as optical and euv ) emission to produce a qpo remains unclear .",
    "one possibility is that the modulation is geometrical in nature , _",
    "e.g _ from varying obscuration of the hot inner portions of the disk .",
    "this would require the system to be at a fairly high inclination , as found by @xcite for this source .",
    "in addition , for this idea be viable the corona would have to be somewhat limited in extent .",
    "thus if the relevant disk oscillations were at @xmath216 ( where @xmath217 is the schwarzschild radius ) and the corona were confined to less than @xmath218 the geometrical model could work .",
    "other scenarios could include having the disk brightness respond in some way to the global oscillation .",
    "the best - fit parameter @xmath219 d in the green s function from equation ( 62 ) ( see fig .  [ fig - green ] ) allows us to derive the kinematic viscosity value because @xmath220 from equation ( 49 ) .",
    "thus the kinematic viscosity is @xmath221 @xmath222 s@xmath223 since @xmath224 cm ( from eq . [",
    "10 ] in to00 for @xmath225 and using @xmath226 and the orbital period 4.1 hours ) .",
    "this estimate leads to @xmath227 cm if we assume that @xmath37 is of order of a thermal velocity at the outer edge of the disk , i.e. @xmath228 cm s@xmath223 .",
    "here we have presented a detailed mathematical analysis of the diffusion propagation model for x - ray outbursts .",
    "we investigated the intrinsic properties of the disk density evolution equation ( 5 ) in a general case .",
    "we have analyzed the diffusion models determined by the disk kinematic viscosity dependence on the radius .",
    "we have demonstrated that the green s ( response ) function is characterized by the fast rising and exponential decay parts ( fred shape ) and that it is an intrinsic property for a wide class of diffusion models .",
    "similar results were obtained by sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) for photon diffusion models .",
    "particularly , the light curve of the instant turn - on of a photon source placed in the center of a spherical cloud ( or the center disk plane ) has a typical fred type shape ( figs . 1 - 2 there ) .",
    "the success in fitting the diffusion model to the observed light curve is very promising .",
    "we have examined the case where the viscosity is a power law function of position in the disk .",
    "we note that a dependence of viscosity on surface density is also possible , but this will make the problem nonlinear ( see lyubarskii & shakura 1987 and lyubarskii 1997 for details ) .",
    "we showed in  [ sec - inverse ] that the steepest descent method can be employed to solve the inverse problem ( a deconvolution ) and extract the input mass accretion function @xmath48 using the observed x - ray luminosity evolution .",
    "such a deconvolution is possible because the inner mass accretion rate and the x - ray rate production are related to each other and the timescale for viscous diffusion is short enough compared to the timescale of the outburst . using the derived @xmath48 as the source term and @xmath204 as a measure of the mass lost from the disk into the black hole",
    ", we derived the mass of the disk as a function of time .",
    "this appears to inversely correlate with the observed qpo frequency as would be expected from the global disk oscillation model , but the correlation is not perfect .",
    "there are several factors that have been ignored for simplicity in this initial treatment which could modify the derived disk mass as a function of time : ( 1 ) a changing efficiency of the conversion of mass to @xmath204 at the inner edge of the disk , ( 2 ) an effective viscous time ( @xmath100 ) which varies with time , and ( 3 ) an additional sink for disk matter such as a jet .",
    "we realize that the model is imperfect but we think that the initial application is encouraging and that further study and application to other sources is warranted .",
    "we conclude by summarizing the main results of the diffusion model .",
    "( 1 ) the asymptotic form ( eq . [ 62 ] ) is characterized by the exponential rise when the escape time is less than the diffusion timescale from the location of mass injection .",
    "the same asymptotic form would be seen for a semi - infinite medium and thus is determined by the escape boundary condition ( in our case at @xmath74 ) and the location of the mass source .",
    "this asymptotic form is insensitive to the size of the medium .",
    "the second asymptotic form is characterized by an exponential decay with the viscous timescale @xmath100 which is a signature of the bounded medium ( in our case , a disk ) rather than any specific model of the diffusion .",
    "( 2 ) the `` fred '' shape of the first outburst of xte j1118 + 480 is in good agreement with the diffusion green s function form ( eq . [ 62 ] ) , for which only one free parameter @xmath100 is important .",
    "the variation of the viscosity index @xmath91 leads to a change of @xmath100 but the `` fred '' shape remains .",
    "this particular result is very important because it is closely related to the intrinsic property of the diffusion green s function .",
    "( 3 ) the value of the parameter @xmath100 has a physically plausible value for the viscous timescale of the disk and ultimately can be applied to the calculation of the disk turbulent scale using certain assumptions regarding the disk size and the turbulent velocity ( 4 ) .",
    "the rise of the second outburst follows the form expected for a step function input , the integral of the green s function .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the shape of this rise is precisely the integral of the green s function derived from the first outburst .",
    "( 5 ) the derived mass varies approximately inversely with the qpo frequency .",
    "( 6 ) similar x - ray luminosity and qpo evolution would be expected in other sources with similar behavior , and in fact is seen in x1354@xmath1644 and groj1719@xmath124 ( brocksopp et al .",
    "2000 ) . in our model ,",
    "the rising qpo frequency is a signature of the accretion disk mass decreasing as it disappears into the black hole .",
    "if qpo frequency varies inversely with disk mass throughout the outburst there is a possibility that early detection  before the mass reaches its maximum  might find the qpo when its frequency is still decreasing .",
    "both the relatively low brightness in the earliest stages of outbursts and the difficulties of prompt response would appear to have selected against detection of this effect to date .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the many helpful comments of an anonymous referee .",
    "basic research in x - ray astronomy at the naval research laboratory is supported by the office of naval research .",
    "this work was performed while rmb held a national research council research associateship award at nrl .",
