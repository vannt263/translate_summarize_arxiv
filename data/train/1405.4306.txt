    "since their discovery@xcite , iron - based superconductors have been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research in order to better understand their physical properties and , more importantly , the origin of superconductivity .",
    "aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( ae - alkali earth ) is one of the most studied structural families in part because it allows for the study of ae , fe , and as site substitutions.@xcite among various members , ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 has the highest bulk @xmath9 of @xmath10 38 k@xcite and doping is done in the ba - layers with the least perturbation to the feas layers , which are believed to be essential for superconductivity .",
    "interestingly , in this series , the superconducting dome extends to , and includes , the end member , kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 with @xmath11 3.5 k.@xcite    learning about the fermi surface ( fs ) is important for understanding of the mechanism of superconductivity.@xcite based on the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies of ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2,@xcite one or two lifshitz transitions@xcite are expected between @xmath12 and @xmath5= 1 .",
    "one lifshitz transition is associated with the disappearance of the electron pockets around the zone corner ( @xmath7 point)@xcite and second lifshitz transition is associated with the transformation of the ellipsoid - like hole pockets at the @xmath7 point into small off-@xmath7 centered hole fs pocket lobes@xcite . both ref . and ref . report a lifshitz transition , albeit at different k - concentrations .",
    "claims the disappearance of the electron pocket at @xmath7 point . ref .",
    "states that the shallow electron pocket is still present at @xmath7 point for @xmath5 = 0.7 and is expected to cross the fermi energy upon further k - substitution in the rigid band approximation .",
    "claims the emergence of four small off-@xmath7-centered lobes with some , within error bars , intensity due to electron pocket at the @xmath7 point .",
    "these results seem contradictory and inconclusive .",
    "interestingly , an anomaly in the pressure derivatives and deviation from the @xmath13 , known as bnc scaling,@xcite were observed at @xmath6 0.7 by pressure dependent magnetization and specific heat measurements.@xcite moreover , an electronic topological ( lifshitz ) transition was predicted at @xmath6 0.9 for ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 by the band structure calculations.@xcite and a change in the superconducting gap symmetry was observed at @xmath14 by thermal conductivity and penetration depth measurements.@xcite    thermoelectric power ( tep ) can be very sensitive to the changes in the fs because , grossly speaking , tep depends , in part , on the derivative of the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "hence , tep measurements can be a good tool for probing the potential changes in the fs topology of ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "tep was measured on polycrystalline samples of hole - doped ( ba , k)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite and it was concluded that @xmath15(300 k ) as a function of k - concentration has a complex behavior and may manifest features consistent with the existence of strong spin fluctuations in heavy - doped k - samples . although transport measurements on polycrystalline samples are useful , most of the time the anisotropic dependencies of the properties are averaged and subtle changes can be smeared and missed .",
    "therefore , we performed tep measurements on single crystals of ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( 0.44 @xmath3 1 ) with @xmath16 on a denser set of k - concentrations on the over - doped side of the phase diagram .",
    "we observe features at @xmath6 0.55 and @xmath6 0.8 - 0.9 that are consistent with the lifshitz transitions that have been associated with the shift of the electron pockets at the @xmath7 point above the fermi level and the transformation of the hole pockets near the @xmath7 point into `` four blades '' as observed by arpes measurements@xcite .",
    "( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals were grown following the procedure outlined in detail in ref .",
    ". an @xmath17 0.55 batch of ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals was grown using fe and as rich melt with an initial elemental composition of ba : k : fe : as = @xmath18:3@xmath5:4:5 . a k- and as - rich melt was used to grow heavily k - doped ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath19 = 0.65 , 0.80 , 0.82 , 0.92 , and 1 ) batches of single crystals with initial elemental compositions of ba : k : fe : as = @xmath20:5:2:6 ( @xmath20 = 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 ) . the elements were loaded into an alumina crucible , and then sealed in a tantalum tube by arc welding .",
    "different soaking temperatures of @xmath21 = 920 , 1000 , and 1050 @xmath22c were used to grow heavily k - doped ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals .",
    "the soaking temperature of @xmath21 = 920 @xmath22c works well for growing ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath19 = 0.92 and 1 ) single crystals .",
    "however , it was found that higher soaking temperatures of @xmath21 = 1000 and 1050 @xmath22c and the temperature window 900 @xmath22c @xmath23 1050 @xmath22c are useful to grow high quality crystals with a sharp superconducting transition for the samples with @xmath19 = 0.65 and 0.80 .    from the earliest growth of ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals@xcite",
    ", it was been appreciated that the degree of k - substitution can vary within the batch or even within the different layers of the same crystal . indeed in this study ,",
    "the single crystals picked from the same batch had different @xmath9 values .",
    "that is why the concentrations of potassium for the specific samples used in this paper were inferred by matching the @xmath9 values obtained from the offset criterion , shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ c - all ] , in the thermoelectric power ( tep ) measurements to that in the published phase diagram @xcite . defining the k - concentration this way poses a difficulty in determining the error bars in the k - concentration .",
    "however , based on the sharpness of @xmath9 , we expect the error bars associated with the value of @xmath5 determined this way to be smaller than 0.05 .",
    "the concentrations of k as determined by this @xmath9 criterion were also checked by measuring the @xmath24-lattice parameters of the same samples that where used for the tep measurements .",
    "after the sample was dismounted from the tep measurement set - up , the ends containing silver paste were carefully cut off and the tiny sample ( @xmath8 1 - 2 mm long and @xmath8 0.1 mm wide ) was placed in the center of the zero - background powder x - ray diffraction holder .",
    "the sample was then oriented manually to give the best reflection conditions at 2@xmath25 corresponding to ( 002 ) set of planes .",
    "after that , the x - ray diffraction pattern , containing five to seven sets of ( 00@xmath26 ) planes in the 10@xmath22 @xmath27 110@xmath22 range , were collected on the single crystal at room temperature using rigaku miniflex powder diffractometer ( cu @xmath28 radiation ) .",
    "the @xmath24-lattice parameters were refined by the lebail method using rietica software .",
    "@xcite the lattice parameters as a function of the k - concentrations ( determined using @xmath9 criterion shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ c - all ] ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ c - all ] .",
    "we also plotted the data from refs .",
    "[ ] ( squares ) and [ ] ( triangles ) for comparison .",
    "the agreement between our data and the literature is quite good .",
    "thermoelectric power measurements were performed using a _",
    "dc _ , alternating heating ( two heaters and two thermometers ) technique @xcite by utilizing quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms@xmath29 ) to provide the temperature environment between 2 and 300 k. the samples were cleaved to get the surface of the samples as clean from the residual flux as possible .",
    "the samples were then cut and mounted directly on the surface of the sd package of the cernox thermometers using du - pont 4929n silver paste to ensure thermal and electrical contact .",
    "the silver paste was allowed to cure at room temperature and 1 atm of air for about 24 h in a desiccator @xcite .",
    "the samples were mounted so that the thermal gradient was applied in the @xmath30-plane .",
    "it should be noted that a small feature at @xmath8 100 k in the data sets for all of the samples measured , independent of @xmath5-value , is probably associated with switching between two temperature ranges of the cernox thermometer calibration curves .",
    "two data points markedly different from the neighboring data points due to this artifact in this temperature region were removed .",
    "thermoelectric power @xmath15 and @xmath31 data as a function of temperature for two single crystals of kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ kfe2as2 ] .",
    "the data for these two samples are very similar except in the @xmath31 for the first sample a difference of @xmath8 6@xmath32 is observed between 5 k ( above the @xmath33 4 k ) and @xmath8 20 k. it is worth pointing out that @xmath31 @xmath10 const above @xmath9 signifying fermi - liquid - like behavior , which is consistent with the resistivity and thermal expansion measurements@xcite .    given that the debye temperature for kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 is rather low , @xmath34 = 177 k,@xcite the origin of the peak at @xmath35 60 k seems unlikely to be due to phonon drag ( expected at 0.1 - 0.3 @xmath34@xcite ) but rather is probably of an electronic nature .",
    "for kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 , a broad feature above 100 k has also been observed in the resistivity measurements , especially in the resistivity measured along the @xmath24-direction,@xcite and thermal expansion measurements@xcite .",
    "the origin of this feature might be associated with a coherence - incoherence crossover due to the scattering of the conduction electrons@xcite . whether the 60 k feature in the tep is associated with this crossover or not is currently unclear .",
    "figures [ svst](a ) and ( b ) show temperature - dependent , in - plane thermoelectric power data @xmath15 of ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( 0.44 @xmath3 1 ) single crystals on linear and semi - log scales respectively . the superconducting state for all of the samples measured can be seen as a drop to zero value in the tep data . above @xmath8 100",
    "k , as the concentration of k increases , the value of the broad maximum in the tep is decreasing in a roughly monotonic way and the position of the maximum at @xmath8 125 k for @xmath6 0.44 moves to slightly higher temperatures of @xmath8 130 k for @xmath36 0.82 .",
    "after @xmath6 0.82 , for the next two potassium concentrations ( @xmath60.9 ) , the maximum collapses into a broad plateau followed by a maximum at @xmath8 60 k for pure kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "the behavior of the tep as the concentration of k is increased is more complex below @xmath8 100 k. the change in the tep with increasing @xmath5 can be better seen on a semi - log plot given in fig . [ svst](b ) . as k - concentration",
    "is increased , the value of @xmath15 decreases until @xmath36 0.55 , where the value of @xmath15 dips and is the smallest , below @xmath8 75 k , of all the samples measured . as the k - concentration",
    "is further increased , the low - temperature @xmath15 values increase again .",
    "it should be noted that the values of the tep that we obtained by our measurements on single crystals are larger for heavy k - doped samples ( @xmath37 0.8 ) than those reported for the polycrystalline samples@xcite .",
    "the difference increases as the k - concentration is increased , most likely reflecting the anisotropies in the scattering that are associated with the 2d character of most of the fermi surfaces of the kfe@xmath2as@xmath2@xcite as opposed to the significantly 3d character of the fermi surfaces of the optimally - doped ba@xmath38k@xmath39fe@xmath2as@xmath2@xcite .",
    "indeed , the anisotropies of upper critical field @xmath40 and the normal state resistivity are also the largest for kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "clear features in @xmath4 vs @xmath5 can often be associated with the lifshitz transitions@xcite and indeed were observed in the tep measured on ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals @xcite . to investigate the possibility of a lifshitz transition in ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals , the data for @xmath15 is plotted as a function of k - concentration at constant temperatures in fig .",
    "here we used 40 k as the lowest temperature which is above @xmath9 for all @xmath5-values studied .",
    "notably a minimum is clearly observable at @xmath36 0.55 for the two lowest temperature cuts . as the temperature",
    "is increased above 75 k , this feature becomes less pronounced and ultimately disappears .",
    "this is consistent with arpes measurements that pointed out @xmath41 0.6 as a concentration where the electron fs pockets at the center of @xmath7 point disappear.@xcite a multi - carrier model of the tep could possibly explain such a change in the @xmath42 data .",
    "however , it seems that computation of the scattering parameters and the tep based on realistic band structure calculations that would also incorporate chemical substitution is beyond the capability of the present theory , especially for the correlated materials .",
    "another , more subtle , feature , a slope change , is seen at @xmath36 0.8 .",
    "the weakness of this feature in the @xmath4 vs @xmath5 at @xmath36 0.8 - 0.9 implies that there is no sharp change in the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the fermi surface of ( ba , k)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 is complicated . the theory of the lifshitz transition as observed by the tep measurements ( refs . and ) despite being extended to include the impurity effect ( the dirty case ) and be valid at @xmath43 0 , is still only developed for the two generic types of lifshitz transitions ( void - formation and neck disruption ) in a single band metal .",
    "the tep depends not only on the derivative of the density of states at the fermi level ( the topology of the fermi surface ) , but also on a type of charge carries , their mobilities and the type of scattering that they undergo , which change with temperature as well .",
    "all of this is hard to take into account when evaluating the functional dependence of the tep near particular lifshitz transition , especially in the multi band material .",
    "perhaps that is why there is no general theory for the lifshitz transitions in multiband materials , such as ( ba , k)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , and no prediction on how strong or weak the feature in the tep associated with lifshitz transition should be .",
    "not surprisingly , depending on the specific details of changes in the fs , the feature associated with the lifshitz transition seen in the tep measurements will be different",
    ". this might be especially pertinent for ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , where at @xmath36 0.8 - 0.9 , hole pockets at the zone corner simultaneously transform into `` four lobes''@xcite .    to visualize the change in @xmath15 at @xmath36 0.8 - 0.9 more clearly , we can look at more than just isothermal @xmath42 cuts ; we can create a broader overview by interpolating or extrapolating our @xmath44 data and create a 2d contour plot,@xcite fig .",
    "[ contoura ] , where @xmath15 is a function of temperature and k - concentration . the @xmath45 phase diagram and the dotted lines indicating the concentrations of the measured samples",
    "were also added to the plot .",
    "it is notable that the red - yellow hight @xmath15 region evolves into a green region in @xmath44 at roughly @xmath36 0.8 - 0.9 , and indicates , as we discussed above , that the broad maximum in @xmath46 evolves into a plateau .",
    "the tep data above @xmath47 can be analysed in a yet another way : for example , for high-@xmath9 cuprates@xcite , the scaling of the @xmath46 data based on the linear fit of the high temperature tep data was done . in order to scale the @xmath46 data in a manner similar to high-@xmath9 cuprates , we performed a linear fit , @xmath15 = @xmath48 - @xmath49 , to the @xmath15 vs @xmath21 data over the temperature range 250 k @xmath50 300 k. figure [ soslope ] shows @xmath48 and @xmath51 as a function of k - concentration .",
    "the evolutions of @xmath48 and the slope @xmath51 with the increase of k content are similar and rather monotonic .",
    "however , two breaks in the slope at @xmath36 0.6 and @xmath36 0.9 can be seen and are at similar @xmath5-values discussed above .",
    "the scaling of the data to the high - temperature slope , @xmath51 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] .",
    "it worth noting that below @xmath8 250 k , the data are split into two manifolds at @xmath36 0.8 - 0.9 , again emphasizing some change in the tep associated with this doping level .",
    "this split into two manifolds further supports the conclusion that @xmath6 0.8 - 0.9 is a critical concentration range .",
    "we think that these observations indicate a change in the fermi surface topology and are consistent with or related to the bnc scaling deviation@xcite that was observed in the specific heat measurements , prediction of the lifshitz transition by the band structure calculations@xcite , arpes measurements@xcite and with the change in the superconducting gap symmetry as observed by thermal conductivity and penetration depth@xcite measurements .",
    "we measured thermoelectric power on ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals in the over - doped side of the @xmath52 phase diagram , 0.44 @xmath3 1 .",
    "we observe a minimum in the @xmath4 vs @xmath5 at @xmath6 0.55 that can be associated with the change in the topology of the fermi surface , significant changes in the electronic structure , correlations , and/or scattering .",
    "this feature is clearly observable below @xmath8 75 k and a higher temperature smears it out .",
    "also , @xmath15 shows a change in the @xmath6 0.8 - 0.9 range , where a broad maximum in @xmath46 evolves into a plateau , seen better in the contour plot of @xmath44 as an evolution of the red - yellow high @xmath15 region into a green region .",
    "in addition , the scaled thermoelectric power data are separated into two manifolds at high temperature at @xmath36 0.8 - 0.9 range as well .",
    "the features seen in the tep measurement are consistent with the lifshitz transitions observed by arpes measurements,@xmath53 , the lifshitz transition at @xmath36 0.55 may be associated with the shift of the electron pockets at the @xmath7 point above the fermi level@xcite and the lifshitz transition at @xmath36 0.8 - 0.9 may be associated with the transformation of the hole pockets near the @xmath7 point into `` four blades''@xcite or other significant changes of the electronic structure or correlations might occur .",
