    "there are infinitely many lattices in the group @xmath5 @xmath6 , of orientation - preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space ( equivalently kleinian groups of finite co - volume ) which can be generated by two elements of finite orders @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , all but finitely many @xmath7 dehn surgeries on any of the infinitely many hyperbolic two - bridge links will have fundamental groups which are such uniform ( co - compact ) lattices @xcite .",
    "two infinite families of such groups are shown below in figure 1 .    in @xcite , we showed that , up to conjugacy , only finitely many of these lattices can be arithmetic . in @xcite",
    ", we identified the 20 such non - uniform lattices of which 15 were _ generalised triangle groups _ ; that is , groups with a presentation of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a word involving both @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) and @xmath12 .    in this paper",
    "we prove that , up to conjugacy , there are exactly @xmath0 arithmetic lattices in @xmath5 which can be generated by two elements of finite orders @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath13 . among these groups there",
    "are , curiously , no generalised triangle groups .",
    "two of the groups are non - uniform ( and are discussed in @xcite ) and the others are identified as fundamental groups of orbifolds obtained by dehn surgeries on 2-bridge knots and links . as such they appear in @xcite and our results establish a conjecture in that paper on the degree of the singular set of such orbifolds .    as a basic reference to the deep relationships between arithmetic and hyperbolic geometry we refer to @xcite .",
    "we note here a few connections . in @xmath14 ,",
    "takeuchi @xcite identified all 82 arithmetic lattices generated by two elements of finite order ( equivalently arithmetic fuchsian triangle groups ) , and , all arithmetic fuchsian groups with two generators have been identified ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the connections between arithmetic surfaces , number theory and theoretical physics can be found in work of sarnak and co - authors eg .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite . in",
    "@xcite vinberg gave criteria for coxeter groups in @xmath15 to be arithmetic .",
    "such groups do not exist in the co - compact case for dimension @xmath16 , @xcite .",
    "it has now been established that there are finitely many conjugacy classes of maximal arithmetic coxeter groups in all dimensions .",
    "there are two proofs see @xcite and @xcite ( previously established in two - dimensions in @xcite ) .    returning to dimension 3 ,",
    "the orientation - preserving subgroups of coxeter groups for tetrahedra , some of which are generated by two elements of finite order , which are arithmetic , are identified in @xcite ( see @xcite for related results ) .",
    "reid @xcite identified the figure eight knot complement as the only arithmetic knot complement .",
    "the four orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds with fundamental group generated by a pair of parabolic elements which are arithmetic are two bridge knot and link complements @xcite .",
    "the 14 finite co - volume kleinian groups with two generators , one of finite order , one parabolic , which are arithmetic are described in @xcite .",
    "an algorithmic approach to deciding if an orbifold obtained by @xmath7 surgery on a two bridge link ( or knot ) has arithmetic fundamental groups was given in @xcite .",
    "arithmetic hyperbolic torus bundles are discussed in @xcite and generalised triangle groups which are kleinian in @xcite .",
    "various extremal groups have been identified as two - generator arithmetic ; for instance the minimal volume non - compact hyperbolic 3manifold and orbifold @xcite .",
    "the week s manifold is arithmetic , two - generator and conjecturally the minimal volume orientable hyperbolc 3-manifold @xcite .",
    "the prime candidate for the minimal volume orientable hyperbolic 3-orbifold is also arithmetic and generated by two elements of finite order @xcite .    before precisely stating our main result",
    "let us say a few words about its proof and why we have the restriction @xmath17 . in our work identifying the two - generator non - uniform lattices in @xcite ,",
    "a key observation was that the non - compactness hypothesis provided _ a priori _ knowledge that the underlying fields were quadratic imaginary and the groups we were looking for were commensurable with bianchi groups . in this paper a major part of the work is to identify the underlying fields . for this",
    "we make use of some important results of stark @xcite and odlyzko @xcite , as well as results concerning the discriminants of number fields of small degree such as those of diaz y diaz and olivier @xcite . using these bounds and some results from the geometry of numbers and various discreteness criteria",
    ", we bound the degree of the fields in question and then , in turn , bound the possible parameters for an arithmetic kleinian group - once we have fixed the orders of the generators , the space of all discrete groups up to conjugacy is parameterised by a one complex - dimensional space .    finally to identify all the groups we use a computer search to examine all algebraic integers in the field satisfying the given bounds and additional arithmetic restrictions on the real embeddings",
    "this procedure gives us a relatively short list of candidate discrete groups which are now known to be subgroups of arithmetic kleinian groups @xcite .",
    "we then use various ideas , discussed in the body of the text , to decide if these groups are in fact arithmetic - at issue here is the finiteness of the co - volume .",
    "thus we are able identify ( up to conjugacy ) all the arithmetic kleinian groups @xmath18 generated by an element @xmath19 of order @xmath2 and @xmath20 of order @xmath3 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 at least @xmath21 .",
    "our results here also give the cases @xmath22 , @xmath23 by the known result that a @xmath24-arithmetic hyperbolic lattice contains a @xmath25-arithmetic hyperbolic lattice with index at most two .",
    "at present the remaining cases @xmath26 and @xmath27 seem computationally infeasible , unless @xmath3 is large enough - although we have made some recent progress using the work of @xcite on the most difficult case @xmath22 and @xmath28 . as the reader will come to realise , the main problem here is finding effective bounds on the degree of the associated number fields .",
    "1 .   @xmath32 , + there are precisely @xmath33 groups enumerated below in table 1 .",
    "( see comments following the table ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath34 , + there is precisely one group obtained by ( 8,0 ) surgery on the knot 5/3 . 3 .",
    "@xmath35 , + there is precisely one group obtained by ( 10,0 ) surgery on each component of the link 13/5 .",
    "@xmath36 , + there are precisely two groups obtained by ( 12,0 ) surgery on the knot 5/3 and on each component of 8/3",
    ".        let @xmath39 denote the arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold whose underlying space is the 3-sphere and whose singular set is the 2 bridge knot or link with slope @xmath37 and has degree @xmath40 . then @xmath41          in two dimensions , there are in fact 32 arithmetic triangle groups with two generators of orders at least @xmath21 on takeuchi s list @xcite . in three dimensions for each @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath42 )",
    "there are infinitely many co - compact generalised triangle groups with a presentation of the form @xmath43 for certain words @xmath44 in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "some of these are discussed in @xcite .",
    "apparently as soon as @xmath45 none of these groups can be arithmetic .",
    "* remark . * in eliminating certain candidates because they are not of co - finite volume - and which are guaranteed discrete by our arithmetic criteria - we ran into a number of interesting examples where our computational package jsnap had difficulty .",
    "this was largely to do with accumulation of roundoff error .",
    "in exploring these groups ( looking for regions of discontinuity ) we made use of the packagelim \" developed by c. mcmullen to draw the limit sets of kleinian groups .",
    "the limit set of one such group is illustrated below . after seeing these pictures",
    "we were encouraged to modify our code to run on a different platform with higher precision to get an infinite volume fundamental region .",
    "however it is clear that in these sorts of cases ( with parameters algebraic integers of low degree ) that working with a version of snap ( the precise arithmetic version of snappea developed by o. goodman et al , @xcite ) would be the correct way forward .",
    "we are currently developing this program which will surely be necessary in extending our results beyond the cases @xmath17 .",
    "* every element @xmath20 of finite order in @xmath49 has a nontrivial fixed point set in @xmath53 which projects to an edge in the singular set of @xmath54 .",
    "elements in the same conjugacy class project to the same edge .",
    "next @xmath50-@xmath51 dehn surgery on a two - bridge knot or link has at most two components in its singular set ( one if it is a knot ) .",
    "let us denote the two primitive generators of order @xmath2 and @xmath3 arising from this surgery as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , so @xmath55 .",
    "suppose @xmath49 has a presentation of the form @xmath56 there are at most two conjugacy classes of torsion in @xmath49 .",
    "thus @xmath57 and any other element of finite order are conjugates of elements of @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "thus , possibly increasing @xmath60 or @xmath61 and the complexity of @xmath44 , we see that we can find a presentation of the form ( [ gtp ] ) with @xmath62 and @xmath63 conjugates of @xmath19 and @xmath20 and so @xmath64 .",
    "suppose that @xmath63 is not a conjugate of @xmath62 .",
    "then as @xmath44 must also be conjugate into @xmath58 or @xmath59 , the relation @xmath65 is a direct consequence of the relators @xmath66 and so @xmath67 which is not possible for a co - finite volume lattice .",
    "thus @xmath63 is a conjugate of @xmath62 and @xmath68 .",
    "this quickly implies that the abelianisation of @xmath49 is a subgroup of @xmath69 as @xmath44 reduces to a power of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , if @xmath49 has a presentation as at ( [ gtp ] ) we have deduced that @xmath49 abelianises to a cyclic group @xmath70 with @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "further , we can not be dealing with a knot surgery as @xmath62 not conjugate to @xmath44 implies two components to the singular set .",
    "next , every two bridge link has a presentation on a pair of meridians of the form @xmath73 for @xmath44 a word determined by the schubert normal form @xcite .",
    "dehn surgery is equivalent to adding the relators @xmath74 which then gives @xmath75 as the abelianisation .",
