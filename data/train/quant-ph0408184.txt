    "when two electrically neutral , conducting plates are placed parallel to each other , our understanding from classical electrodynamics tells us that nothing should happen to these plates .",
    "the plates are assumed to be that made of perfect conductors for simplicity . in 1948 ,",
    "h. b. g. casimir and d. polder faced a similar problem in studying forces between polarizable neutral molecules in colloidal solutions .",
    "colloidal solutions are viscous materials , such as paint , that contain micron - sized particles in a liquid matrix . it had been thought that forces between such polarizable , neutral molecules were governed by the van der waals interaction . the van der waals interaction is also referred to as the `` lennard - jones interaction . ''",
    "it is a long range electrostatic interaction that acts to attract two nearby polarizable molecules .",
    "casimir and polder found to their surprise that there existed an attractive force which could not be ascribed to the van der waals theory .",
    "their experimental result could not be correctly explained unless the retardation effect was included in van der waals theory .",
    "this retarded van der waals interaction or lienard - wiechert dipole - dipole interaction is now known as the casimir - polder interaction @xcite .",
    "casimir , following this first work , elaborated on the casimir - polder interaction in predicting the existence of an attractive force between two electrically neutral , parallel plates of perfect conductors separated by a small gap @xcite .",
    "this alternative derivation of the casimir force is in terms of the difference between the zero - point energy in vacuum and the zero - point energy in the presence of boundaries .",
    "this force has been confirmed by experiments @xcite and the phenomenon is what is now known as the `` casimir effect . ''",
    "the force responsible for the attraction of two uncharged conducting plates is accordingly termed the `` casimir force . ''",
    "it was shown later that the casimir force could be both attractive or repulsive depending on the geometry and the material property of the conductors @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect is regarded as macroscopic manifestation of the retarded van der waals interaction between uncharged polarizable molecules ( or atoms ) .",
    "microscopically , the casimir effect is due to interactions between induced multipole moments , where the dipole term is the most dominant contributor if it is non - vanishing .",
    "therefore , the dipole interaction is exclusively referred to , unless otherwise explicitly stated , throughout this investigation .",
    "the induced dipole moments can be qualitatively explained by the concept of `` vacuum polarization '' in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the idea is that a photon , whether real or virtual , has a charged particle content .",
    "namely , the internal loop , illustrated in figure [ cap : vacuum - polarization ] , can be @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 or @xmath4 pairs , etc .",
    "its correctness have been born out from the precision measurements of lamb shift @xcite and photoproduction @xcite experiments over a vast range of energies .",
    "for the almost zero energy photons considered in the casimir effect , these pairs last for a time interval @xmath5 consistent with that given by the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy imbalance and @xmath8 is the planck constant .",
    "these virtual charged particles can induce the requisite polarizability on the boundary of the dielectric ( or conducting ) plates which explained the casimir effect .",
    "however , the dipole strength is left as a free parameter in the calculations because it can not be readily calculated @xcite .",
    "its value can be determined from experiments .",
    "once this idea is taken for granted , one can then move forward to calculate the effective , temperature averaged , energy due to the dipole - dipole interactions with the time retardation effect folded in . the energy between the dielectric ( or conducting ) media is obtained from the allowed modes of electromagnetic waves determined by the maxwell equations together with the boundary conditions .",
    "the casimir force is then obtained by taking the negative gradient of the energy in space .",
    "this approach , as opposed to full atomistic treatment of the dielectrics ( or conductors ) , is justified as long as the most significant photon wavelengths determining the interaction are large when compared with the spacing of the lattice points in the media .",
    "the effect of all the multiple dipole scattering by atoms in the dielectric ( or conducting ) media simply enforces the macroscopic reflection laws of electromagnetic waves .",
    "for instance , in the case of the two parallel plates , the most significant wavelengths are those of the order of the plate gap distance .",
    "when this wavelength is large compared with the interatomic distances , the macroscopic electromagnetic theory can be used with impunity .",
    "the geometric configuration can introduce significant complications , which is the subject matter this study is going to address .    in order to handle the dipole - dipole interaction hamiltonian in this case",
    ", the classical electromagnetic fields have to be quantized into the photon representation first .",
    "the photon with non - zero occupation number have energies in units of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the planck constant divided by @xmath11 and @xmath12 the angular frequency .",
    "the lowest energy state of the electromagnetic fields has energy @xmath13 they are called the vacuum or the zero point energy state , and they play a major role in the casimir effect . throughout this investigation ,",
    "the terminology `` photon '' is used to represent the entity with energy @xmath14 or the entity with energy @xmath15 unless explicitly stated otherwise . with this in mind , the quantized field energy is written as    @xmath16\\hbar c\\theta_{k'}\\nonumber \\\\   & \\times\\sum_{n_{1}=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n_{2}=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n_{3}=0}^{\\infty}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left[k'_{i}\\left(n_{i},l_{i}\\right)\\right]^{2}},\\label{eq : stationary - state - energy - bounded}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the speed of light in empty space , @xmath18 is the degree of freedom in polarization , @xmath19 is the wave number , @xmath20 is the wave mode number and @xmath21 the boundary length .",
    "the subscript @xmath22 of @xmath23 denotes the bounded space . for electromagnetic waves , the degree of freedom in polarization ,",
    "@xmath24 similarly , in free space , the field energy is quantized in the form @xmath25\\hbar c\\theta_{k'}}{f_{1}\\left(l_{1}\\right)f_{2}\\left(l_{2}\\right)f_{3}\\left(l_{3}\\right)}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\nonumber \\\\   & \\times\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left[k'_{i}\\left(n_{i},l_{i}\\right)\\right]^{2}}dk'_{1}dk'_{2}dk'_{3},\\label{eq : stationary - state - energy - unbounded}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath26 of @xmath27 denotes free ( unbounded ) space and the functional @xmath28 in the denominator is equal to @xmath29 for a given @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the zeroes of the function representing the transversal component of the electric field .",
    "the corresponding zero point energy for bounded ( or unbounded ) space is obtained by setting @xmath32 in equations ( [ eq : stationary - state - energy - bounded ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary - state - energy - unbounded ] ) , respectively .",
    "in principle , the atomistic approach utilizing the casimir - polder interaction @xcite explains the casimir effect observed in any system .",
    "unfortunately , the pairwise summation of the intermolecular forces for systems containing large number of atoms can become very complicated . h. b. g. casimir , realizing the linear relationship between the field and the polarization , devised an easier approach to the calculation of casimir effect for large systems such as two perfectly conducting parallel plates @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect have been also explained by schwinger utilizing his original invention , `` source theory '' @xcite .    in this investigation , we do not follow casimir s energy method , nor do we take the route of schwinger s source theory .",
    "instead , we adopt the vacuum pressure approach introduced by milonni , cook and goggin @xcite , which is a simple elaboration on casimir s original calculation technique utilizing the boundary conditions .",
    "we choose to consider the vacuum pressure approach over both casimir s energy method and schwinger s source theory not because it is a superior technique , but simply because it is the easiest one for the physical arrangements considered in this investigation .",
    "the three physical arrangements for the boundary configurations considered in this investigation are : ( 1 ) the plate - hemisphere , ( 2 ) the hemisphere - hemisphere and ( 3 ) a sphere formed by brining two hemispheres together . because the geometric configurations of items ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are special versions of the more general , plate - hemisphere configuration , the basic reflection dynamics needed for the plate - hemisphere case is worked out first .",
    "the results can then be applied to the hemisphere - hemisphere and the sphere configurations later .",
    "the vacuum - fields are subject to the appropriate boundary conditions . for boundaries made of perfect conductors ,",
    "the transverse components of the electric field are zero at the surface . for this simplification ,",
    "the skin depth of penetration is considered to be zero .",
    "the plate - hemisphere under consideration is shown in figure [ cap : cross - sectional - view - plate - and - hemisphere ] .",
    "the solutions to the vacuum - fields are that of the cartesian version of the free maxwell field vector potential differential equation @xmath33 where the coulomb gauge @xmath34 and the absence of the source @xmath35 for scalar potential @xmath36 have been imposed , @xmath37 the electric and the magnetic field component of the vacuum - field are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the free field vector potential .",
    "the vanishing of the transversal component of the electric field at the perfect conductor surface implies that the solution for @xmath41 is in the form of @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the wavelength and @xmath44 is the path length between the boundaries .",
    "the wavelength is restricted by the condition @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two immediate reflection points in the hemisphere cavity of figure [ cap : cross - sectional - view - plate - and - hemisphere ] . in order to compute the modes allowed inside the hemisphere resonator , a detailed knowledge of the reflections occurring in the hemisphere cavity",

    "for the hemispheres made of ordinary conducting materials , there would result a series of reflections in one hemisphere cavity due to those radiations entering the cavity from nearby hemisphere . for simplicity ,",
    "the ordinary conducting material referred to here is that of perfect conductors without boyer s hypothetical material property requirement .",
    "furthermore , only the radiation emanating normally with respect to its surface is considered .",
    "the idea is to illustrate that the `` normally emanated radiation '' from one hemisphere results in elaboration of the effects of `` obliquely emanated radiation '' on another hemisphere cavity . here",
    "the obliquely emanated radiation means those radiation emanating from a surface not along the local normal of the surface .    when two such hemispheres are brought together to form a sphere ,",
    "there would exist some radiation trapped in the sphere of which the radiation energy flow lines are not spherically symmetric with respect to the sphere center . to see how a mere change in configuration invokes such non - spherically symmetric energy flow ,",

    "for clarity , only one `` normally emanated radiation '' energy flow line from the left hemisphere is shown .",
    "when one brings together the two hemispheres just in time before that quantum of energy escapes the hemisphere cavity to the right , the trapped energy quantum would continuously go through series of complex reflections in the cavity obeying the reflection law .",
    "but how fast or how slow one brings in two hemispheres is irrelevant in invoking such non - spherically symmetric energy flow because the gap @xmath363 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "therefore , there would always be a stream of energy quanta crossing the hemisphere opening with @xmath364 as shown in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - universe - config - demo ] .",
    "in other words , there is always a time interval @xmath5 within which the hemispheres are separated by an amount @xmath363 before closure .",
    "the quanta of vacuum - field radiation energy created within that time interval @xmath5 would always be satisfying the condition @xmath365 and this results in reflections at oblique angle of incidence with respect to the local normal of the walls of inner sphere cavity .",
    "only when the two hemispheres are finally closed , would then @xmath366 and the radiation energy produced in the sphere after that moment would be spherically symmetric and the reflections would be normal to the surface . however , those trapped quantum of energy that were produced prior to the closure of the two hemispheres would always be reflecting from the inner sphere surface at oblique angles of incidence .    unlike boyer s ideal laboratory , realistic laboratories have boundaries made of ordinary material as illustrated in figure [ cap : reallab ] .",
    "one must then take into account , when calculating the casimir force , the vacuum - field radiation pressure contributions from the involved conductors , as well as those contributions from the boundaries such as laboratory walls , etc .",
    "we will examine the physics of placing two hemispheres inside the laboratory .",
    "for simplicity , the boundaries of the laboratory as shown in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - reallab ] are assumed to be simple cubical . normally , the dimension of conductors considered in casimir force experiment is in the ranges of microns .",
    "when this is compared with the size of the laboratory boundaries such as the walls , the walls of the laboratory can be treated as a set of infinite parallel plates and the vacuum - fields inside the the laboratory can be treated as simple plane waves with impunity .",
    "the presence of laboratory boundaries induce reflection of energy flow similar to that between the two parallel plate arrangement . when the two hemisphere arrangement shown in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - universe - hemi - to - sphere ] is placed in such a laboratory , the result is to elaborate the radiation pressure contributions from obliquely incident radiations on external surfaces of the two hemispheres .",
    "if the two hemispheres are made of conducting material satisfying boyer s material property , the vacuum - field radiation impinging on hemisphere surfaces at oblique angles of incidence would cause heating of the hemispheres .",
    "it means that boyer s hemispheres placed in a realistic laboratory would continue to rise in temperature as a function of time .",
    "however , this does not happen with ordinary conductors .",
    "if the two hemispheres are made of ordinary perfect conducting materials , the reflections of radiation at oblique angles of incidence from the laboratory boundaries would elaborate on the radiation pressure acting on the external surfaces of two hemispheres at oblique angles of incidence . because boyer s sphere only radiates in the normal direction to its surface , or only responds to impinging radiation at normal incidence with respect to the sphere surface , the extra vacuum - field radiation pressures considered here , i.e. , the ones involving oblique angles of incidence , are missing in his casimir force calculation for the sphere .",

    "@xmath417 is from equation ( [ eq : points - on - plate - r - final - na ] ) of appendix c3 and @xmath418 is defined in equation ( [ eq : n - max - hemisphere - na ] ) of appendix c2 .      because only the specification of boundary is needed in casimir s vacuum - field approach as opposed to the use of a polarizability parameter in casimir - polder interaction picture , the casimir force is sometimes regarded as a configurational force . on the other hand",
    ", the casimir effect can be thought of as a macroscopic manifestation of the retarded van der waals interaction . and",
    "the casimir force can be equivalently approximated by a summation of the constituent molecular forces employing casimir - polder interaction .",
    "this practice inherently relies on the material properties of the involved conductors through the use of polarizability parameters .",
    "in this respect , the casimir force can be regarded as a material dependent force .",
    "boyer s material property is such that the atoms in his conducting sphere are arranged in such manner to respond only to the impinging radiation at local normal angle of incidence to the sphere surface , and they also radiate only along the direction of local normal to its surface .",
    "when the casimir force is calculated for a sphere made of boyer s fictitious material , the force is repulsive .",
    "also , in boyer s original work , the laboratory boundary did not exist . when boyer s sphere is placed in a realistic laboratory ,",
    "the net casimir force acting on his sphere becomes attractive because the majority of the radiation from the laboratory boundaries acts to apply inward pressure on the external surface of sphere when the angle of incidence is oblique with respect to the local normal .",
    "if the sphere is made of ordinary perfect conductors , the impinging radiation at oblique angles of incidence would be reflected . in such cases",
    "the total radiation pressure applied to the external local - sphere - surface is twice the pressure exerted by the incident wave , which is the force found in equation ( [ eq : sphere - ambient - force - average - total ] ) of the previous section .",
    "however , boyer s sphere can not radiate along the direction that is not normal to the local - sphere - surface . therefore , the total pressure applied to boyer s sphere is half of the force given in equation ( [ eq : sphere - ambient - force - average - total ] ) of the previous section .",
    "this peculiar incapability of emission of a boyer s sphere would lead to the absorption of the energy and would cause a rise in the temperature for the sphere . nonetheless , the extra pressure due to the waves of oblique angle of incidence is large enough to change the casimir force for boyer s sphere from being repulsive to attractive .",
    "the presence of the laboratory boundaries only act to enhance the attractive aspect of the casimir force on a sphere .",
    "the fact that boyer s sphere can not irradiate along the direction that is not normal to the local - sphere - surface , whereas ordinary perfect conductors irradiate in all directions , implies that his sphere is made of extraordinarily hypothetical material , and this may be the reason why the repulsive casimir force have not been experimentally observed to date .    in conclusion , ( 1 )",
    "the casimir force is both boundary and material property dependent .",
    "the particular shape of the conductor , e.g. sphere , only introduces the preferred direction for radiation .",
    "for example , radiations in direction normal to the local surface has bigger magnitude than those radiating in other directions .",
    "this preference for the direction of radiation is intrinsically connected to the preferred directions for the lattice vibrations . and",
    ", the characteristic of lattice vibrations is intrinsically connected to the property of material .",
    "( 2 ) boyer s sphere is made of extraordinary conducting material , which is why his casimir force is repulsive .",
    "( 3 ) when the radiation pressures of all angles of incidence are included in the casimir force calculation , the force is attractive for charge - neutral sphere made of ordinary perfect conductor . and , lastly , ( 4 ) the casimir force problem involving any non - planar geometric boundary configurations can always be reduced to a series of which the individual terms in the series are that of the parallel plates problem .",
    "because each terms in the series are that of parallel plates problem , the summation over these individual terms result in an attractive casimir force .    [ [ suggestions - on - the - detection - of - repulsive - casimir - force - for - a - sphere ] ] suggestions on the detection of repulsive casimir force for a sphere ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the first step in detecting the repulsive casimir force for a spherical configuration is to find a conducting material that most closely resembles the boyer s material to construct two hemispheres . it has been discussed previously that even boyer s sphere can produce attractive casimir force when the radiation pressures due to oblique incidence waves are included in the calculation .",
    "therefore , the geometry of the laboratory boundaries have to be chosen to deflect away as much as possible the oblique incident wave as illustrated in figure [ cap : casimir - effect - test - lab ] .",
    "once these conditions are met , the experiment can be conducted in the region labeled `` apparatus region '' to observe boyer s repulsive force .",
    "the phenomenon of sonoluminescense remains a poorly understood subject to date @xcite .",
    "when a small air bubble of radius @xmath419 is injected into water and subjected to a strong acoustic field of @xmath420 under pressure roughly @xmath421 the bubble emits an intense flash of light in the optical range , with total energy of roughly @xmath422 this emission of light occurs at minimum bubble radius of roughly @xmath423 the flash duration has been determined to be on the order of @xmath424 @xcite .",
    "it is to be emphasized that small amounts of noble gases are necessary in the bubble for sonoluminescense .",
    "the bubble in sonoluminescense experiment can be thought of as a deformed sphere under strong acoustic pressure .",
    "the dynamical casimir effect arises due to the deformation of the shape ; therefore , introducing a modification to @xmath425 from that of the original bubble shape . here",
    "@xmath426 is the path length for the reflecting wave in the original bubble shape . in general @xmath427 from the relations found in this work for the reflection points @xmath428 and @xmath429 together with the dynamical casimir force expression of equation ( [ eq : dynamical - force - l - dot - only-3d - na ] )",
    ", the amount of initial radiation energy converted into heat energy during the deformation process can be found .",
    "the bubble deformation process shown in figure [ cap : sonoluminescense ] is a three dimensional heat generation problem .",
    "current investigation seeks to determine if the temperature can be raised sufficiently to cause deuterium - tritium ( d - t ) fusion to occur , which could provide an alternative approach to achieve energy generation by this d - t reaction ( threshold @xmath430 ) @xcite .",
    "its theoretical treatment is similar to that discussed on the * 1d * problem shown in figure [ cap : casimir - plates - outlook ] .",
    "if one can create a laboratory as shown in figure [ cap : casimir - effect - test - lab ] , and place in the laboratory hemispheres made of boyer s material , then the hemisphere - hemisphere system will execute an oscillatory motion .",
    "when two such hemispheres are separated , the allowed wave modes in the hemisphere - hemisphere confinement would no longer follow boyer s spherical bessel function restriction .",
    "instead it will be strictly constrained by the functional relation of @xmath431 where @xmath432 and @xmath433 are two neighboring reflection points .",
    "only when the two hemispheres are closed , would the allowed wave modes obey boyer s spherical bessel function restriction .    assuming that hemispheres are made of boyer s material and the laboratory environment",
    "is that shown in figure [ cap : casimir - effect - test - lab ] , the two closed hemispheres would be repulsing because boyer s casimir force is repulsive .",
    "once the two hemispheres are separated , the allowed wave modes are governed by the internal reflections at oblique angle of incidence . since the hemispheres made of boyer s material",
    "are `` infinitely unresponsive '' to oblique incidence waves , all these temporary non - spherical symmetric waves would be absorbed by the boyer s hemispheres and the hemispheres would heat up .",
    "the two hemispheres would then attract each other and the oscillation cycle repeats .",
    "such a mechanical system may have application .",
