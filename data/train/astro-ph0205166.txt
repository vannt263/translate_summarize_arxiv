    "the main task of observational cosmology is to identify which of the idealized models , that theoretical cosmologists construct , relates to the universe we live in .",
    "one may think that since we can not perform experiments and study , in a laboratory sense , the universe as a whole , this is a futile task .",
    "nature however has been graceful , and through the detailed and exhaustive analysis of the detected electromagnetic radiation emitted from the different photon - generating processes , we can do wonders !    among the many important tasks of observational cosmology is the determination of the total mass - energy density of the universe , the rate of its expansion , its age , the amount of ordinary and exotic matter that it contains , as well as to quantify in a objective and bias free manner the large - scale distribution of matter , as traced by galaxies , clusters of galaxies and agn s for example",
    ".    however , these tasks are not easy to fulfil .",
    "subjective ( instrumentation , available funds , technological limitations etc ) as well as objective ( observational biases , limitations due to our position in space - time , etc ) difficulties exist .",
    "furthermore , we do not know whether the universe accessible to our observations is representative of the whole universe",
    ". a positive answer to this question is essential in order to meaningfully compare observations with theory . under the assumption",
    "that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic ( in a statistical sense ) , well separated regions can be viewed as independent realizations of the same formation process . therefore many of such regions constitute an ensemble and thus we can employ statistical techniques in our study .    in the classical big - bang cosmological framework the universe indeed is considered homogeneous and isotropic on the large - scales .",
    "the most general metric satisfying this assumption , the so - called _ cosmological principle _",
    ", is the robertson - walker metric ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite ) : @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the expansion factor , @xmath9 is a constant , related to curvature of space and ( @xmath10 ) are spherical - polar coordinates . the main observational evidence that supports the choice of this model is :    * the observed expansion of the universe .",
    "edwin hubble found that the redshifts of galaxies are proportional to their apparent magnitudes and assuming that they are equally luminous then their redshifts are proportional to their distances : @xmath11 .",
    "* the existence of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , interpreted as the relic radiation from the hot initial phase of the universe . * the observed light element abundances that this theory correctly predicts .",
    "however , the observed matter distribution in the universe is very inhomogeneous on small - scales .",
    "so , what evidence do we have supporting the validity of the cosmological principle ?",
    "firstly , the _ hubble s law _ is directly obtained if one assumes a homogeneous expansion of the universe , ie .",
    ", if a length @xmath12 is expanded by a factor @xmath8 , then after some time we have @xmath13 .",
    "differentiating we obtain the hubble law : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , at the present time ( @xmath16 ) , is the hubble constant .",
    "secondly , observations of distant extragalactic radio sources have shown that they are distributed across the sky in a uniform way . other supporting evidence",
    "is provided from the decreasing - with scale - correlations of extragalactic objects and the directional independence of the correlation function .",
    "however , the most remarkable confirmation that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic and also that it evolved from a hot dense past , was the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation and its high degree of isotropy across the sky .",
    "this radiation has been interpreted as the relic radiation from the time that matter decoupled from radiation , which has been freely travelling ever since .",
    "the high degree of isotropy of the cmb is direct evidence that the universe was highly isotropic at the epoch of decoupling ( @xmath17 ) to one part in @xmath18 on scales from arc - minutes to @xmath19 , once we subtract a local dipole anisotropy , attributed to our peculiar motion with respect to the rest - frame defined by the cmb .      out of the many parameters which are essential for accurately determining the global dynamics and the formation history of the universe ; three clearly stand out : the hubble constant,@xmath20 , which tells us the expansion rate of the universe , the matter density parameter , @xmath21 , which tells us how much matter , being baryonic or exotic , the universe contains and the cosmological constant , @xmath22 , which tells us whether the universe is filled with an extra repulsive force . the way in which these parameters affect the cosmological evolution , are determined by the gravitational field equations and the assumed equation of state .",
    "below , i will sketch the basic framework of standard cosmology , in order to derive the interrelations of these parameters and how they relate to the global dynamics of the universe .      within the context of a homogeneous and isotropic universe we can derive the cosmological evolution equations using either einstein s field equations or newtonian gravity .",
    "the latter is possible exactly because of the cosmological principle , ie .",
    ", we can consider any volume element , as small as necessary for newtonian gravity to apply , as being representative of the universe as a whole .",
    "we will derive the evolution equations for the newtonian case , using however as an active mass density : @xmath23 which is given within the framework of general relativity for a homogeneous and isotropic fluid with density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 .",
    "in this case we can derive the evolution equations using the mass continuity equation and newton s equation of the motion of a small sphere .",
    "we have from the homogeneity assumption that @xmath26 , from isotropy that @xmath27 and then from @xmath28 we obtain : @xmath29 \\frac{\\dot{r}}{r } = 0\\ ] ] rearranging ( [ eq : contin ] ) and using newton s equation of motion , @xmath30 , we have : @xmath31   = 0\\ ] ] and integrating we obtain a newtonian analogue of cosmological evolution equation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the constant of integration , which is closely related to the newtonian energy .",
    "we can see this if we rearrange ( [ eq : foundam ] ) as : @xmath34 . within the relativistic formulation ,",
    "the constant is in effect related to the curvature of space ; @xmath35 and the basic equation of cosmological evolution , the _",
    "friedmann equation _",
    ", is written : @xmath36 where the cosmological constant ( @xmath22 ) term was introduced by einstein ( rather _ ad hoc _ ) in order to obtain his preferred static solution .",
    "given an equation of state , @xmath37 , we can solve for @xmath24 and then ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath8 .",
    "if we recall newton s equation of motion , @xmath30 , and we use the active density ( [ eq : activ ] ) and ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) , we derive the second important dynamical equation of cosmological evolution . the correct relativistic form of this equation",
    "is : @xmath38      the question arises of which is the appropriate equation of state for the expanding universe .",
    "the universe expands adiabatically ) .",
    "] , since the symmetry imposed by the cosmological principle implies that there is no net heat flow through any surface .",
    "therefore as it expands , it cools ( [ eq : cools ] ) and since it started with a very hot phase , it will be dominated , at different epochs , by different species of particles having distinct equations of state .",
    "relativistic particles will dominate the hot phase while non - relativistic the later cooler phases .",
    "we can specify a unique equation of state @xmath39 for all epochs by parameterizing it according to : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the velocity dispersion of the fluid elements . if the dominant contribution to the density comes from relativistic particles , which have @xmath42 ( when @xmath43 , with @xmath44 ) , then @xmath45 . if the dominant contribution comes from non - relativistic matter ( when @xmath46 with @xmath47 ) then there is negligible pressure and the dust approximation is excellent ( @xmath48 ) .    therefore inserting ( [ eq : state ] ) into the mass continuity equation , ( [ eq : contin ] ) , we obtain : @xmath49 armed with ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) one can now solve the friedmann equation to get the time evolution of @xmath8 , determine the age of the universe , etc , in the different cosmological models .",
    "the early universe , where very high densities and temperatures dominate , can be treated by using fluid thermodynamics . at very high temperatures ,",
    "radiation and matter are in thermal equilibrium , coupled via thomson scattering with the photons dominating over the nucleons ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "therefore the primordial fluid can be treated as radiation - dominated with @xmath51 and from ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath52 therefore the temperature of the universe drops linearly with the expansion scale factor . furthermore , it is evident from ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) , that the radiation density drops faster than the mass density and since we know from measurements that the universe is matter dominated today , then at some epoch in the past , say at a redshift @xmath53 , we had @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath55 ( the subscript @xmath56 denotes the present epoch ) and using the measured values of @xmath57 we have that : @xmath58 therefore the thermal history of the universe can be divided in two main eras : a _ radiation dominated era _ ( @xmath59 ) and a _ matter dominated era _",
    "( @xmath60 ) . in the radiation dominated era ,",
    "in which we can neglect the curvature and @xmath22 terms in friedmann s equation ( see next section ) , we have : @xmath61 by differentiating this relation with respect to time and using ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) we have : @xmath62 using @xmath63 we finally obtain the important relation between cosmic time and the temperature of the universe in the radiation dominated era : @xmath64 from which it is evident that the universe at early times was hot enough for nucleosynthesis to occur , as it had been supposed originally by gamow .",
    "the era of nucleosynthesis takes place around @xmath65 k.      although the dynamics during the _ radiation dominated era _ are unaffected by ordinary matter , the electrons act as a scattering medium of the radiation and thus the universe at this epoch is _ opaque_. as the universe cools , @xmath66 , electrons bind electrostatically with protons to form neutral hydrogen . using _",
    "saha s ionization _ equation one finds that the temperature at which the number of free electrons drops significantly is @xmath67 k.    therefore when the universe cools at this temperature , the scattering medium disappears and the radiation freely escapes without being absorbed or scattered which means that the universe becomes transparent .",
    "this epoch is called the _ recombination _ epoch .",
    "the existence of the relics of this radiation was predicted by gamow and his collaborators in the 1940s .",
    "it was subsequently discovered by penzias & wilson in 1965 , while the whole spectrum of this radiation was traced to unprecedented accuracy by the cobe satellite observations .",
    "the cmb possesses a perfect _ black - body _ spectrum with a mean temperature of @xmath68 k and it is extremely isotropic except for a dipole , which is however a local kinematical effect ( due to our motion with respect to the cosmic rest frame defined by the cmb ) . from what",
    "redshift does the cmb radiation originate ? from ( [ eq : cools ] ) we have that : @xmath69 with @xmath67 k and @xmath70 we get that @xmath71 from ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) we have that in the matter dominated era @xmath72 and thus @xmath73 corresponds to a time : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the present age of the universe .",
    "therefore by studying the microwave background sky we have direct information from the universe when it was as young as @xmath76 .",
    "due to our motion with respect to the isotropic cmb radiation we observe a dipole in the distribution of the radiation temperature .",
    "although this has the appearance of a _ doppler _ effect , in reality four different effects add up to produce this dipole seen by an observer moving with a velocity @xmath77 .",
    "these four effects are :    * a doppler effect that increases the frequency of photons , and thus the observed energy , seen in the direction of motion by a doppler factor @xmath78 * the interval of frequencies increases by the same factor in the direction of motion , and therefore since @xmath79 , the above two effects cancel out .",
    "* the moving observer selects in the direction of motion relatively more photons by a factor @xmath80 * the solid angle in the direction of motion is smaller by a factor @xmath81 due to abberation .",
    "the net effect is that the moving observer sees an intensity of cmb radiation @xmath82 . due to the adiabatic expansion of the universe , ( @xmath83 ) , the shape of the planck spectrum : @xmath84^{-1}\\ ] ]",
    "should be preserved , which then necessarily implies that @xmath85 and thus : @xmath86 cobe observed a cmb dipole amplitude of @xmath87 mk ( which corresponds to a fluctuation @xmath88 ) .",
    "the corresponding velocity of earth is : @xmath89 towards the galactic coordinates @xmath90 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this motion is due to the vectorial sum of the motion of the earth around the sun , of the sun within the galaxy , of the galaxy within the local group and of the peculiar motion of the local group , due to the gravitational effects of large - scale density fluctuations .",
    "the motion of the earth with respect to the lg centroid is : @xmath91 towards @xmath92 and thus we find the velocity of the lg centroid with respect to the cmb : @xmath93 towards @xmath94    the local group velocity was originally thought as the result of the attraction of the local supercluster ( virgo ) .",
    "however , there is a residual velocity of @xmath95 km / sec that must be due to gravitational forces acting on the lg from distances greater than the local supercluster s centre - of - mass ( @xmath96 km / sec ) .",
    "many earlier studies pointed towards the _ ` great attractor ' _ , a mass concentration of @xmath97 @xmath98 located at a distance of 42 @xmath99 mpc and at low galactic latitudes , as being the sole cause of a relatively local coherent motion , in which the local group partakes ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "later studies , indicated that another very massive and more distant ( @xmath100 @xmath99 mpc ) attractor could play a significant role in shaping the local dynamics ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it seems that the coherence scale of the velocity field could extend to even larger distances than what originally thought ( cf .",
    "@xcite , however for a different view see @xcite ) .      based on ( [ eq : ein1 ] )",
    "we can define some very important parameters like the _ critical density _",
    ", which is the density necessary to obtain a flat universe ( @xmath101 ) : @xmath102 and the _ cosmological density parameter _",
    "@xmath103 , which is a unit - less measure of the density of the universe : @xmath104 furthermore , the constant of proportionality in hubble s law , the _ hubble constant _ , is : @xmath105 note that the necessity of parametrizing with @xmath106 was due to earlier discordant determinations of @xmath20 .",
    "today most studies converge to a value of @xmath107 ( see section 2.4 ) .",
    "a convenient representation of these interrelations can be produced by re - writing friedmann s equation , in the matter dominated era ( using [ eq : rho1 ] ) , as following : @xmath108 were the contribution to the total density parameter from the curvature and @xmath22 terms is : @xmath109 note that @xmath110 is called _",

    "note that we can have a flat universe ( @xmath113 ) while having @xmath114 ( as suggested by many different observations ) .      using ( [ eq : new_fre ] ) , evaluated at the present epoch",
    ", we have @xmath115 and from @xmath116 we obtain the age of the universe : @xmath117 for example , in an _ einstein - de sitter _ universe ( @xmath118 ) we have : @xmath119 while for a @xmath120 model we obtain : @xmath121\\ ] ] we therefore see that if @xmath122 we have that the age of the universe is larger than what is predicted in an einstein - de sitter universe .      due to the recent exciting observational indications for a positive cosmological constant and the important consequences that this has to our understanding of the cosmos , we will briefly present this model .    originally , the cosmological @xmath22-parameter was introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ by einstein in his field equations in order to get a static solution ( @xmath124 ) . from ( [ eq : ein2 ] ) he derived @xmath125 and inserting this into ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) he obtained , in a matter dominated ( @xmath126 ) universe : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the critical value of @xmath22 for which @xmath124 .",
    "however , it was found that his solution was unstable and that small perturbations of the value of @xmath128 would change drastically the behaviour of @xmath129 . from ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) we see that if @xmath130 , then @xmath131 is always nonnegative for @xmath132 , and thus the universe expands for ever , while if @xmath133 then the universe can expand and then recontract again ( as in the @xmath134 , @xmath101 case ) .",
    "the recent snia observations ( see section 3.2 ) and the cmb power - spectrum results ( see section 3.1 ) have shown that the _ standard _ cosmological paradigm should be considered that of a flat , @xmath135 , @xmath136 model .",
    "thus we will consider such a model in the following discussion .",
    "evaluating ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) at the present epoch , changing successively variables : @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 and then integrating , we obtain : @xmath140\\ ] ] and @xmath141    it is interesting to note that in this model there is an epoch which corresponds to a value of @xmath142 , where the expansion slows down and remains in a quasi - stationary phase for some time , expanding with @xmath143 thereafter ( see fig.1 ) . at the quasi - stationary epoch ,",
    "called the inflection point , we have @xmath144 and thus from ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) by differentiation we have : @xmath145 now from ( [ eq : lam0 ] ) and ( [ eq : infl ] ) we have that the age of the universe at the inflection point is : @xmath146 the hubble function at @xmath147 is : @xmath148 so if @xmath149 we must have @xmath150 .",
    "this is an important result because it indicates that introducing an @xmath151-term , and if we live at a time that fulfils the condition @xmath152 , we can increase the age of the universe to comfortably fit the globular cluster ages while keeping the value of @xmath153 and also a flat ( @xmath113 ) space geometry . from ( [ eq : tinfl ] ) and ( [ eq : lam ] ) and for the preferred values @xmath154 and @xmath155 we indeed obtain @xmath156 ( see also fig.1 ) , which implies that we live in the accelerated phase of the universe .",
    "note that in order for the present time ( @xmath75 ) to be in the accelerated phase of the expansion we must have : @xmath157 .      due to the recent interest in the @xmath158 , @xmath159 universes , it is important to investigate the dynamical effects that this term may have in the evolution of the universe and thus also in the structure formation processes ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "we realize these effects by inspecting the magnitudes of the two terms in the right hand side of ( [ eq : ein1 ] ) .",
    "we have the density term : @xmath160 and from ( [ eq : totomega ] ) we have @xmath161 by equating the above two terms we can find the redshift at which they have equal contributions to the dynamics of the universe .",
    "evidently this happens only in the very recent past : @xmath162 observations suggest that @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and therefore we have @xmath165 , which implies that the present dynamics of the universe are dominated by the @xmath22-term , although for the largest part of the history of the universe the determining factor in shaping its dynamical evolution is the matter content .",
    "similar results are found for the @xmath9-term in @xmath101 models . in this case",
    "we have from ( [ eq : attr ] ) that @xmath166 and thus the redshift at which the density and curvature terms have equal impact in the global dynamics , is : @xmath167 we see that as @xmath168 increases the density term grows faster than the curvature term which is important only very recently .",
    "a similar line of argument shows that also in the radiation dominated era the @xmath22 and @xmath9 terms do not affect the dynamics of the universe .      from ( [ eq : new_fre ] ) and eliminating the curvature term , using @xmath170 , we obtain the time evolution of the density parameter @xmath21 : @xmath171\\ ] ] and using ( [ eq : crden ] ) and ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) we have : @xmath172}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that whatever the value of @xmath21 , at large @xmath168 we always have @xmath173 .",
    "the task of determining and quantifying the 3-dimensional distribution of extragalactic objects , is not a trivial .",
    "limitations are imposed on us by our position in space - time , and also the fact that we are located in the plane of a dusty spiral galaxy , which means that the light - absorbing interstellar dust will cause the magnitudes and sizes of galaxies to decrease , especially if we observe towards the galactic plane .    generally in order to be able to quantify the geometry and topology of the large - scale structure of the universe and to discriminate between the competing scenarios of structure formation",
    ", two at least issues should be addressed :    * ( a ) * the quantification , in an objective manner , of the observed structure on large scales . for this",
    "we need to observe the positions and redshifts of galaxies tracing large - volumes , large enough to be considered a fair sample of the universe . if not we can be influenced by local",
    "_ anomalies _ ( like a local attractor or a local underdense region ) and thus the interpretation of our results could lead us to erroneous conclusions .",
    "today there are large samples available , complete to some apparent magnitude limit which are deep enough for volume - limited samples to be extracted from them ( for example the pscz , ors , las campanas , apm , ssrs , 2df , sdss catalogues ) .    * ( b ) * the application of well defined and easily applicable statistics , which are able to distinguish between the different theoretical scenarios of structure formation and to compare between these scenarios and the observed topology and geometry of the large - scale structure of the universe .    of historical interest are the first attempts to quantify the distribution of galaxies by bok and mowbray ( in the mid 1930s ) .",
    "they compared the variance of galaxy counts @xmath174 with that expected from a poisson distribution ( ie , compared @xmath175 with @xmath176^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath177 is the number of fields ) and concluded that @xmath178 an indication that _",
    "galaxies cluster_. more sophisticated statistics appear in the mid-50 s when the large lick galaxy counting project started giving its first results ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . through the years",
    "a wide variety of statistical techniques have been developed in order to study the geometry and topology of the distribution of matter on large - scales ( for reviews see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies are the basic units of the distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "they are conglomerations of stars , dust and gas having typical sizes of a few kpc . only recently ,",
    "in the 1920s , was it realized that the fuzzy nebulae , that we now know to be galaxies , were not part of the milky - way .",
    "there appear to be many different types of galaxies , having different shapes , amounts of gas and dust , as well as star - forming regions .",
    "many attempts have been made to produce a reliable classification scheme that bears relation to physical quantities .",
    "galaxies come into three main categories : ellipticals , spirals and irregulars , in which the basic difference , as their names imply , is their apparent shape .",
    "however , further subdivision is essential in order to classify reliably the large variety of galaxies .    the first attempt to classify galaxies was that of hubble in 1926 .",
    "his principal morphological classification was provided by the `` tuning - fork '' diagram , in which the position of a galaxy was determined by the size of its nucleus and on the spiral arm tilt . for historical reasons",
    ", galaxies at the left of the diagram are called `` early types '' while at the right `` late types '' .",
    "although this diagram was produced on the basis of appearance there seem to be a link between morphology and galaxy evolution since the integrated colours and spectral types monotonically increase from left to right ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fraction of the different galaxy types is : @xmath179 ellipticals ( e ) , @xmath180 sos , @xmath181 spirals ( s ) and @xmath182 irregulars ( irr ) .",
    "the spiral galaxies consist of three components : disk , bulge and halo .",
    "the disk is very thin ( a few hundred pc thick ) .",
    "the surface brightness of stars in a typical disk falls exponentially with radius : @xmath183}\\ ] ] where @xmath184 is the scale - length of the disk ( typically @xmath185 kpc ) .",
    "the spiral structure is thought to be the result of rotating density waves which produce shocks in the gas - rich disk which leads to star formation .",
    "the elliptical galaxies however , are ellipsoidal systems with an old population of stars and very little gas .",
    "they have a _ de vaucouleurs _ luminosity distribution : @xmath186}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 is the _ effective _ radius enclosing half of the total light .",
    "therefore @xmath188 falls off more slowly than @xmath189 for @xmath190 and more rapidly for @xmath191 ( this formula also fits the bulges of sos and spirals ) .",
    "the mass of elliptical galaxies can vary widely ; from dwarfs with @xmath192 @xmath98 to supergiants with @xmath193 @xmath98      galaxy clusters occupy a special position in the hierarchy of cosmic structures in many respects .",
    "being the largest bound structures in the universe , they contain hundreds of galaxies , large amounts of dark matter ( dm ) and hot x - ray emitting gas , and thus can be detected at large redshifts .",
    "therefore , they appear to be ideal tools for studying large - scale structure , testing theories of structure formation and extracting invaluable cosmological information ( see recent reviews @xcite , @xcite ) groups of galaxies are typically systems that contain @xmath194 galaxies ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "there are several classification schemes for clusters .",
    "a simple and clear - cut one is between _ regular _ and _ irregular _ clusters .    *",
    "* regulars : * they have smooth and symmetric structure , with high central density ( @xmath195/mpc@xmath196 ) , a small fraction of spiral galaxies ( @xmath197 ) , high velocity dispersion ( @xmath198 km / sec ) and high x - ray luminosity . the high velocity dispersion as well as the smooth structure",
    "is considered to be evidence that these clusters are in virial equilibrium ( relaxed ) .",
    "about @xmath199 of all clusters are regulars . *",
    "* irregulars : * they have lumpy structure with evident substructures , lower velocity dispersion and lower x - ray luminosity . the fraction of spirals is higher than that in regular clusters ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "another distinct class of clusters is those having a central very bright galaxy ( bcg or cd s ) .",
    "the bcg galaxies are giant ellipticals , some with multiple nuclei ( cd s ) and masses @xmath201 .",
    "there are different views regarding their formation history ; one advocates that they form by  galactic cannibalism \" where dynamical friction causes cluster galaxies to spiral towards the cluster core and then strong tidal effects take place ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , the other advocates that they form at _ special _ locations , which are the kernels around which clusters will eventually form by anisotropic accretion of matter ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) . furthermore :    * there is a well defined relationship between galaxy density and fraction of hubble types .",
    "the fraction of e s and so s increases smoothly with increasing galaxy - density ( @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether the above relation is a direct result of the galaxy formation processes , or an evolutionary effect .",
    "* clusters are highly flattened systems even more than elliptical galaxies .",
    "this fact is not due to rotation ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , and therefore it either reflects the initial conditions of their formation and/or the tidal effects acting between proto - clusters .",
    "in fact , the high peaks of an initial gaussian density field , the possible sites of cluster formation , are non - spherical ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster mean projected ellipticity is @xmath202 and there is evidence that clusters are more prolate - like ( cf .",
    "* neighbouring clusters tend to point to each other up to distances of @xmath203 @xmath99 mpc ( cf .",
    "dynamically young ( irregular ) clusters show a tendency to be more aligned with their neighbours and are preferentially found in high - density environments ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    for large - scale clustering , dynamical and cosmographical studies ,",
    "it is extremely important to compile large , whole - sky catalogues of groups and clusters .",
    "one of the first and extensively studied such catalogue is the abell / aco catalogue @xcite , which was based on an eyeball selection procedure from sky survey plates .",
    "this all - sky sample contains 4073 rich clusters , nominally complete to a redshift @xmath204 .",
    "its obvious limitations , due to the eyeball selection procedure , were superseded by the objectively selected apm clusters ( @xcite ) which were based on the apm galaxy catalogue containing @xmath205 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "this cluster catalogue covers latitudes @xmath206 and contains 950 clusters , typically poorer than the abell / aco one s .",
    "furthermore , with the rosat whole - sky x - ray survey it was possible to construct x - ray selected cluster catalogues ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which suffer less from projection effects , which can produce _ phantom _ clusters . for example",
    "the reflex x - ray cluster sample contains @xmath207 clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "superclusters are aggregates of clusters , groups and galaxies .",
    "they are the largest , isolated , but dynamically un - relaxed due to their size , objects in the large scale distribution of matter and thus they are ideal probes of the initial conditions that gave rise to them .",
    "this fact is because typical peculiar velocities of clusters are @xmath208 km / sec and therefore in a hubble time ( @xmath209 ) they can move no more than @xmath21010 @xmath99 mpc , which is substantially smaller than the scale of a typical supercluster .",
    "superclusters can be identified in 3-d catalogues of clusters but also in 2-d projections of galaxy distributions .",
    "regions of high density in clusters can be identified also on the apm galaxy map .",
    "the large scale clustering pattern of galaxies is expected to be characterized by a filamentary and sheet - like distribution ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed many authors have been finding that the vast majority of the superclusters are flattened with a predominance of filament - like shapes ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the 2-dimensional projection of a filamentary supercluster containing 5 apm clusters .",

    ". however larger structures , with a length @xmath212 mpc , may exist ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "detailed studies have shown that elongated bridges ( @xmath213 @xmath99 mpc ) of galaxies have been found to connect rich clusters .",
    "since wide - angle three - dimensional surveys became available , the filamentary distribution of galaxies has been a constantly observed feature .",
    "even the original cfa survey ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) showed networks of filaments mostly connecting rich clusters of galaxies and large voids ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , a fact which has been confirmed by all the recent surveys ( ssrs , ors , pscz etc ) .",
    "voids are regions of density well below the average value . in all deep radial - velocity surveys ,",
    "the velocity distribution shows striking empty regions were no ( or very few ) galaxies exist .",
    "it is an extremely difficult task to identify voids in 2-d projections of galaxy distributions since the projection will tend to smooth - out any such structure .",
    "an extremely interesting question , relevant to theories of structure formation , is whether the voids are empty of luminous matter or empty of all matter .",
    "one of the most important parameters in determining the fate of the universe as a whole , is the present day expansion rate of the universe , which is encapsulated in the value of the hubble constant @xmath20 .",
    "its value sets the age of the universe and specifies the value of the critical density @xmath214 , and through this route the geometry of the universe .    from the hubble law ( [ eq : hub ] )",
    "it is evident that in order to determine its value we need to determine the expansion velocity ( redshift ) as well as the distance of extragalactic objects , but within a redshift such that space - curvature effects do not affect distances ( [ eq : lumd ] ) .",
    "a further concern is that local gravitational effects produce _ peculiar _ velocities , that are superimposed on the general expansion .",
    "this can easily be seen in the toy model of ( [ eq : hub ] ) , if we allow @xmath215 .",
    "then @xmath216 with the factor on the right being the peculiar velocity .",
    "since the observer as well as the extragalactic object , of which the distance we want to measure , have peculiar velocities then the above equation becomes : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the velocity of the observer and @xmath219 is the unit vector along the line - of - sight to the extragalactic object .",
    "it is then obvious that in order to measure @xmath20 , the local velocity field should be measured and the extragalactic distances corrected accordingly .",
    "it is easily seen that if both observer and galaxy take part in a coherent bulk flow , having the same amplitude at the observer and galaxy positions , then the right - hand part of ( [ eq : hub1 ] ) vanishes . in general",
    "however , one needs good knowledge of the velocity field in order to correct distances adequately .",
    "our only means of obtaining information and therefore knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the universe ( on all different scales ) are through the electromagnetic radiation that we receive .",
    "therefore it is of primary importance to define a system of measuring luminosities taking also into account that the universe expands and that light loses energy through a variety of processes .    if we assume that light propagates with no loss of energy , then the apparent luminosity of a source @xmath220 , is related to its absolute luminosity @xmath221 , by : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the distance to the source .",
    "we can see the extreme importance of determining the pair ( @xmath224 ) , since such knowledge would provide the distance of the source , @xmath223 .",
    "due to historical mostly reasons we use a logarithmic brightness system by which an object with a magnitude of 1 is 100 times brighter than an object with a magnitude 6 .",
    "we have : @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the apparent magnitude and @xmath177 the absolute one .",
    "therefore , using ( [ eq:1 ] ) we have : @xmath227 where @xmath228 are constants which depend on the filter used and @xmath229 is that value for which @xmath230 at a distance of 10 parsecs ( see section 2.3 ) from the earth , and thus @xmath231 . in extragalactic astronomy , instead of @xmath232 , we use @xmath233 and therefore ( [ eq:2 ] ) becomes : @xmath234    the above definitions are somewhat @xmath235 , since in the real world we do not observe the total apparent magnitude , but that corresponding to the particular range of spectral frequencies , that our detector is sensitive to , and those allowed to pass through earth s atmosphere . if we detect @xmath236 over a range of frequencies @xmath237 , then the observed apparent magnitude is @xmath238 .",
    "however , neither the atmosphere nor the detectors have a sharp @xmath239 limit and therefore it is better to model these effects by a sensitivity mask @xmath240 , and the observed apparent magnitude is then : @xmath241   + c\\ ] ] if @xmath242 then the apparent ( or absolute ) magnitude of a source is called the @xmath243 magnitude .    how do the above definitions change by taking into account the fact that the universe expands ? to answer this we need a metric of space - time , which in our case is the _ robertson - walker _ metric . since light travels along null - geodesics , a fundamental concept of distance",
    "can be defined by the corresponding light - travel time , which is called _",
    "proper distance_. if a light signal is emitted at a galaxy @xmath244 from the coordinate position @xmath245 at time @xmath16 and received by an observer at @xmath246 at @xmath247 , then these events are connected only by the light signal and since all observers must measure the same speed of light , it defines a very fundamental concept of distance .",
    "obviously , it depends on the curvature of space , and since @xmath248 we have from ( [ eq : rwm ] ) : @xmath249 in the expanding universe framework , the expressions ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) change , to : @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the _",
    "luminosity distance_. it is obvious that the distance measure of an extragalactic object depends on the underlying cosmology . a proper derivation of the luminosity distance ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) provides the following expression : @xmath252\\ ] ] where @xmath103 contains all the contributions ( mass , energy density , curvature ) .",
    "another important distance definition is that of the angular - diameter .",
    "it is based on the fact that a length @xmath220 , subtends a smaller angle , @xmath253 , the further away it is ( @xmath254 ) and it is given from : relation to : @xmath255 note that this notion of distance is used to derive the cmb power spectrum predictions of the different cosmological models ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "many effects , related either to our position in space ( being on the plane of a dust - rich spiral galaxy ) , to natural limitations ( introduced for example by the expansion of the universe ) or to detector related issues , introduce systematic biases that affect our ability to measure accurately distances .",
    "below , i list a few of the most important such effects .",
    "since bolometric magnitudes are not possible to measure , but rather magnitudes over a particular wavelength range , it is important to correct these magnitudes for the effect of the expansion of the universe .",
    "these considerations result in modifying the distance modulus by a factor , the so - called @xmath256correction factor : @xmath257 this factor arises from the fact that when we measure the magnitude of sources at large distances and at a particular frequency , say @xmath258 , we receive light emitted from a different part of the spectrum , @xmath259",
    ". it could well be that in this latter part of the spectrum the extragalactic object is particularly fainter or brighter than in the nominal one , @xmath258 .",
    "furthermore , a combination of different factors ; evolution , intervening absorption processes or detector sensitivity for example , result in energy losses as a function of wavelength , which can be expressed by a mask @xmath260 ( [ eq : fv ] ) .",
    "knowing @xmath260 one can estimate the @xmath261-factor by integrating the spectrum at the source rest frame .",
    "for example , such calculations have shown that a typical value for spiral galaxies at @xmath262 is @xmath263 ( in general @xmath264 ) .",
    "due to the nature of astronomical observation there is a minimum flux density above which we select extragalactic objects .",
    "as we look deeper in the universe we tend to pick up a relatively larger fraction of intrinsically bright objects ( ie .",
    ", only the brighter end of the luminosity function is sampled ) .",
    "this bias arises when determining distances from apparent magnitude limited samples .",
    "if the individual absolute magnitudes @xmath265 of a sample of extragalactic objects have a gaussian distribution around @xmath266 with dispersion @xmath267 , then this bias , for the case where the distribution of extragalactic objects is considered homogeneous , is given by : @xmath268 how does this bias affect the determination of extragalactic distances ?",
    "the inferred distances of extragalactic objects are typically smaller than their true distances . from ( [ eq : mm0 ] ) we have that : @xmath269    we illustrate this bias in fig.4 ; as the distance increases , @xmath270 becomes brighter and therefore the brighter end of the luminosity function is sampled . for a larger @xmath271 ( deeper sample ) the value of @xmath270 increases ( less luminous )",
    "so we have a smaller @xmath272 .",
    "conversely , for a given @xmath271 and @xmath266 , the bias increases with distance .",
    "note that we have considered a fairly straight - forward case , ie .",
    "that of a sample with a unique @xmath266 value . in real samples of extragalactic objects",
    "we have a range of such values and therefore this bias is not easily seen .",
    "a related bias that also affects extragalactic distance determinations is the fact that there are larger numbers of objects at larger distances and therefore within a given range of estimated distances , more will be scattered by errors from larger to smaller distances than from smaller to larger ones .",
    "interstellar gas and dust absorbs the background light with dust scattering more efficiently the blue light , and thus the background light appears artificially reddened . from simple geometrical considerations it is easy to show that the flux @xmath236 of an extragalactic source , transversing a galactic layer of thickness @xmath273 , at an angle @xmath184 from the equatorial plane , suffers losses @xmath274 and therefore : @xmath275 where the constant of proportionality @xmath276 is the absorption coefficient at the spectral frequency @xmath239",

    "we see from ( [ eq : corrected ] ) and ( [ eq : mm0 ] ) that @xmath284}\\ ] ] ie .",
    ", the distance of an extragalactic source at a given absolute magnitude can be significantly overestimated at low galactic latitudes if this effect is not taken into account .",
    "note however that the cosec@xmath285 model is oversimplified since the distribution of gas and dust in the galaxy is rather patchy .",
    "as we look back in time we see a distribution of extragalactic objects ( normal galaxies , agn s , clusters ) in different evolutionary stages",
    ". it may well be that their luminosity and/or mean number density is a function of cosmic time , a fact that will affect distance determinations based on local calibrations of the relevant scaling - relations .",
    "since galaxies are extended objects with no sharp outer boundaries , their photometric measures will depend also on the size of the telescope aperture since at different distances different fraction of a galaxy will fit in the aperture .",
    "this is a distance ",
    "dependent effect , since diameters scale like @xmath286 , and therefore it may affect the distance estimate .      in order to develop the distance ladder from local to distant cosmic objects , one starts from the local distance scale ( for a detailed account see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the primary method used to estimate the distances to nearby stars is that of _ trigonometric parallax_. as the earth orbits the sun , we view the universe from different points of the orbit throughout the year .",
    "this difference is maximum every 6 months when the earth is on the opposite side of its orbit around the sun .",
    "this kinematic method provides the basic unit of distance , the _ parsec _ , used by astronomers .",
    "it is defined as the distance at which a star would have a trigonometric parallax of 1@xmath287 ( parsec =",

    "sec_ond ) : @xmath288 note that this method is effective out to @xmath289 parsecs and that the nearest star to us ( @xmath290-centauri ) is at a distance of 0.75 parsecs .    among the many distance indicators , used to determine distances within our galaxy , a particularly interesting one is the _",
    "main sequence fitting _ method .",
    "this takes advantage of the fact that stars in globular clusters are at a common distance and that there is a unique correlation between spectral stellar type and absolute luminosity ( the _ h - r _ diagram ) . therefore by measuring the distance , via a kinematic method , to one relatively near globular cluster , one sets the zero - point of this method and then by observing the apparent magnitude - spectral type distribution of other globular clusters , one can determine their distance .",
    "the next step is based on _ cepheid variable stars_. this method has been traditionally used within our galaxy and in the nearby large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , but with the _ hubble space telescope _ it has been successfully used out to @xmath291 mpc ( cf .",
    "a strong and tight relationship exists between the intrinsic luminosity of these stars and their period of variation ( pulsation ) which results in a period - luminosity relation : @xmath292 once this relation has been calibrated , it provides the absolute luminosity of the distant cepheid stars and via ( [ eq : mm0 ] ) , the distance of their host galaxy .",
    "although this relation has a scatter , in the @xmath293band , of only @xmath294 , systematic effects may exist .",
    "for example , a serious concern is whether there is any environmental dependence of the relation .",
    "it has been suggested that a different metalicity of the host galaxy may significantly affect the zero - point of the relation and thus the determined distance .",
    "these effects can be taken into account and this method has proved to be fundamental in the recent determinations of @xmath20 , because it provides the link between the primary galactic indicators and the _ local _ extragalactic ones , which then provide the calibration for other secondary indicators operating in much larger distances ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in developing the distance scale , we now need effective indicators that can be used to very large distances .",
    "other scaling relations have been found between a distance dependent ( ex .",
    "brightness , diameter ) and a distance independent ( ex . rotational velocity , stellar velocity dispersion ) quantity .",
    "it is evident that from such relations one can extract distance information .",
    "the main assumption in such a use of these scaling relations is that they are not environment - dependent ( which has been shown to be a valid assumption ) .",
    "such a relation for spiral galaxies is the _ tully - fisher relation _",
    "@xcite , which relates the rotational velocity of a spiral to its total infrared luminosity : @xmath295 or its total blue luminosity : @xmath296 with @xmath297 .",
    "it has a reasonable theoretical justification : rotational velocities in spirals are related to mass according to @xmath298 assuming that all spirals have the same surface brightness @xmath299 , then @xmath300 if the mass to light ratio is constant then @xmath301    for ellipticals a similar relation holds , the _ faber - jackson _ relation @xcite , which relates the absolute luminosity of the galaxy with the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath302 ) or a variant , the so - called _ @xmath303 relation _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which relates the diameter @xmath304 of an elliptical ( defined as that within which the mean surface brightness is 20.75 _ mag arc sec@xmath305 _ in b ) to the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath267 : @xmath306 with @xmath307 .",
    "the typical accuracy of these distance estimations is @xmath180 and the usual assumption is that they do not evolve with redshift over the scales used , and that systematic effects can be corrected for .",
    "however , there are some indications for an evolution of the @xmath308-band _ tully - fisher _ relation in the interval studied @xmath309 @xcite .",
    "another very important distance indicator , which can be used to large distances , is the _ supernova snia brightness at maximum_. it is thought that the maximum luminosity of such supernovae ( explosion of white dwarfs in binary systems which become gravitationally unstable - reaching the chandrasekhar limit - due to the accretion of matter from the secondary - see @xcite ) is a universal constant and since the intrinsic luminosity of a snia is high , they can be seen out to cosmological distances . furthermore , a correlation was found between the supernova luminosity and the brightness decay time , which provides a further parameter that reduces the scatter in luminosity to @xmath310 mags . using this distance indicator one can construct the hubble diagram to very large - distances and thus determine the deceleration of the universe by mapping the region of the hubble diagram that deviates from linearity .",
    "this has been recently achieved by two independent groups , the _",
    "supernova cosmology project - scp _ @xcite and the _ high - z supernova search team - hzt _",
    "@xcite , which have found that the derived hubble diagram is that expected from a accelerating expansion , which can be provided by a non - zero cosmological constant ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "although i do not plan to present all the secondary distance indicators , one that is potentially very important and susceptible to small uncertainties and systematics , is the _ surface brightness fluctuation _ method .",
    "this method is based on the fact that the discreteness of stars within galaxies depends on distance .",
    "this methods has an accuracy of @xmath182 in distance .",
    "clusters of galaxies are filled with hot and transparent gas which can be fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with @xmath311 ( covering a range of 2 @xmath210 8 kev ) .",
    "the physics of the hot intercluster gas provides the means of measuring directly the distance of clusters , without need of intermediate steps .",
    "this method is based on the so called _ sunyaev - zeldovich effect _ which is the distortion of the original cmb spectrum , by the compton scattering to higher energies of the cmb photons from the hot electrons of the plasma ( for recent reviews see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this distortion decreases the brightness of the cmb spectrum at the longer wavelength range while it increases the photon energies in the shorter wavelength range . lets assume a cluster of radius @xmath129 at a distance @xmath80 , subtending an angular separation @xmath253 on the sky .",
    "the change of the cmb brightness temperature is proportional to the line integral of electron number density through the cluster : @xmath312 then from isothermality we get @xmath313 .",
    "furthermore the luminosity of the bremsstrahlung radiation together with the assumption of isothermality , gives : @xmath314 from ( [ eq : x1 ] ) , the observed x - ray flux ( @xmath315 ) and @xmath316 we have : @xmath317 and solving for @xmath80 we get : @xmath318 therefore measuring @xmath319 , @xmath253 , @xmath320 we obtain an absolute determination of the cluster distance .",
    "the temperature , @xmath320 , can be measured either from the shape of the x - ray continuum or from line emission ( especially of iron ) .",
    "note however , that we have assumed sphericity , isothermality and a smooth distribution of @xmath321 .",
    "most clusters are flattened ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and show significant substructure apparent in the optical and x - ray images .",
    "in such clusters the above procedure may provide highly uncertain and biased distance estimates ( cf .",
    "a recent study of @xmath322 clusters has shown that once cooling flows are taken into account , isothermal profiles fit well @xmath323 of the clusters ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the immense effort that has been put towards the goal of determining @xmath20 , with an accuracy of a few % , has recently come to fruition with different methods providing consistent ( within @xmath324 ) values . in table 1 , i present a list of some of the most recent determinations of @xmath20 .",
    "note that there are 3 different measurements based on snia , giving different values of @xmath20 .",
    "although many of the snia they use are common , the difference is most probably attributable to the different local calibrations that they employ .",
    "thus , the differences in their derived @xmath20 s should reflect the _ systematic _ uncertainty introduced by the different local calibrations and it is indeed comparable to the systematic uncertainty that the individual studies have estimated .",
    "the method in the last row of table 1 is based on _ gravitational lensing _ ( cf .",
    "the basic principle behind this method is that there is a difference in the light travel time along two distinct rays from a source , which has been gravitationally lensed by some intervening mass .",
    "the relative time delay ( @xmath325 ) , between two images of the source , can be measured if the source is variable .",
    "then it can be shown that the hubble constant is just : @xmath326 where @xmath327 is the image separation and @xmath33 is a constant that depends on the lens model .",
    "although , this method has well understood physical principles , still the details of the lensing model provide quite large uncertainties in the derived @xmath20 .",
    "a crude @xmath174-weighted average of the different @xmath20-determinations in table 1 gives : @xmath328 where the uncertainty reflects that of the weighted mean ( the individual uncertainties have not been taken into account ) .",
    "however , there seems to be some clustering around two preferred values ( @xmath329 and @xmath330 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) and thus the above averaging provides biased results .",
    "more appropriate is to quote the median value and the 95% confidence limits : @xmath331 the anisotropic errors reflect the non - gaussian nature of the distribution of the derived @xmath20-values .",
    "note that the largest part of the individual uncertainties , presented in table 1 , of all methods except the last two , are _ systematic _ because they rely on local calibrators ( like the distance to the lmc ) , which then implies that a systematic offset of the local zero - point will `` perpetuate '' to the secondary indicators although internally they may be self - consistent .",
    "a further source of systematic errors is the peculiar velocity model , used to correct the derived distances , which can easily introduce @xmath332 shifts in the derived @xmath20 values @xcite @xcite .",
    ".some recent determinations of the hubble constant , based on different methods . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the rate of growth of perturbations is different in universes with different matter content .",
    "for example , the perturbation growth in a @xmath333 universe is proportional to the scale factor , ie .",
    ", @xmath334 , while in the extreme case of an empty universe ( @xmath335 ) ; @xmath336 constant .",
    "from ( [ eq : omeg_z ] ) we see that @xmath114 universes will behave dynamically as an @xmath337 universe at large enough redshift , and at some redshift @xmath338 curvature dominates and perturbations stop evolving and freeze , allowing clusters to relax up to the present epoch much more than in an @xmath333 model , in which clusters are still forming .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig.15 where we plot the evolution of the perturbation growth factor , defined as : @xmath339 for a @xmath340 universe , @xmath341 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and thus for the eds model @xmath342 . for @xmath343 models",
    "there is a redshift dependence of @xmath344 , but in the present epoch it is indistinguishable from the corresponding value of the open ( @xmath345 ) model @xcite .",
    "it is evident that an @xmath346 universe behaves as an @xmath333 model up to a lower redshift than the corresponding open model , while at redshifts @xmath347 it behaves like an open model , which implies that clusters should be dynamically older in such a model than in the eds",
    ".    therefore one should be able to put constraints on @xmath103 from the evolution of various indicators of cluster formation , especially in the range where the dynamical evolution between the models differs maximally ( vertical dashed lines in fig.15 ) .",
    "ideally , one would like to study the evolution of the cluster mass function but since light is what we observe ( temperature as well - due to the hot icm x - ray emission ) , various related indicators are usually studied ( luminosity function , temperature function , morphology etc ) , but then one has to pass through the machinery provided by the press - schechter formalism @xcite , which gives the mass function of collapsed halos at any epoch as a function of the cosmological parameters that enter through the assumed power spectrum of perturbations .",
    "based mostly on einstein and rosat surveys , many studies have found an evolving x - ray luminosity function , ie . , less @xmath348 clusters than expected for a no - evolving luminosity function , ie . , a negative evolution ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such a behaviour is expected in models with @xmath349 however , see @xcite for a different view .",
    "estimates of the temperature of the x - ray emitting icm gas can be reliably estimated from the iron line - emission .",
    "then the cluster temperature can be either transformed to a mass ( assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermality ) and thus derive a mass function to compare with the press - schechter predictions ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) pointing to @xmath350 , or use the evolution of the temperature distribution function . again different studies find either no evolution ( cf .",

    "@xcite one obtains @xmath357 , and then by using ( [ eq : x1 ] ) : @xmath358 where @xmath359 is the gas mass fraction . then one finds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath360 where @xmath361 is given by ( [ eq : new_fre ] ) and @xmath362 is the ratio of the average density within the virialized cluster ( @xmath363 ) and the critical density at redshift @xmath168 , which also depends on the cosmological model .",

    "most studies ( see references in @xcite ) have found _ no _ evolution of the relation while a recent study of a deep ( @xmath367 ) rosat cluster survey @xcite found : @xmath368 however , there are many physical mechanisms that affect this relation ( eg . gas cooling , supernova feedback etc ) and in ways which are not fully understood ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as we have already discussed , in an open or a flat with vacuum - energy contribution universe it is expected that clusters should appear more relaxed with weak or no indications of substructure . instead ,",
    "in a critical density model , such systems continue to form even today and should appear to be dynamically active ( cf .",

    "the criteria are based on the fact that gas is collisional while galaxies are not and therefore during the merger of two clumps , containing galaxies and gas , we expect : ( _ 1 _ ) a difference in the spatial positions of the highest peak in the galaxy and gas distribution , ( _ 2 _ ) due to compression , the x - ray emitting gas to be elongated perpendicularly to the merging direction , and ( _ 3 _ ) temperature gradients to develop due to the compression and subsequent shock heating of the gas .",
    "the first two indicators are expected to decay within @xmath369 gyr after the merger , while the last may survive for a considerably longer period ( see for example fig.16 ) .",
    "for such a study to be fruitful , a large number of clusters , ideally covering the redshift range @xmath370 , must be imaged in both the optical and x - ray band .",
    "however , a rather cruder but still useful test of cluster morphological evolution could be used .",
    "for example , cluster ellipticity is a relatively well defined quantity ; although systematic effects due to projections in the optical or the strong central concentration of the x - ray emitting gas ( since @xmath371 ) , should be taken into account ( cf .",
    "an early study , using the lick map @xcite , had found that cluster ellipticity decreases with redshift , however due to possible systematic effects involved in the construction of the data , they did not attach any weight to this discovery .",
    "recently , two studies using optical and/or x - ray data @xcite @xcite ( see also @xcite ) found that indeed the cluster ellipticity decreases with redshift in the recent past , @xmath372 ( see fig.17 ) this was interpreted by @xcite as an indication of a low-@xmath21 universe because in such a universe one expects that merging and anisotropic accretion of matter along filaments will have stopped long ago .",
    "thus the clusters should be relatively isolated and gravitational relaxation will tend to isotropize the clusters reducing their ellipticity , more so in the recent times .    if this is the case then one should expect an evolution of the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas as well as the x - ray cluster luminosity which should follow the same trend as the cluster ellipticity , decreasing at recent times , since the violent merging events , at relatively higher redshifts , will compress and shock heat the diffuse icm gas @xcite .",
    "such evidence was presented in @xcite using a compilation of measured icm temperatures and luminosities in two volume limited x - ray cluster samples ( based on the xbac and bcs samples ) . also",
    ", one could naively expect an evolution of the cluster velocity dispersion , increasing at lower redshifts , since virialization will tend to increase the cluster ` thermal ' velocity dispersion . in @xcite",
    "no evolution was found between a local sample ( @xmath373 ) and a distant one @xmath374 .",
    "however , unrelaxed clusters can also show up as having a high velocity dispersion due to either possible large peculiar velocities of the different sub - clumps @xcite or due to the possible sub - clump virialized nature .",
    "therefore , a better physical understanding of the merging history of clusters is necessary in order to be able to utilize the velocity dispersion measure as an evolution criterion .",
    "other related studies , using the morphological characteristics of the large - scale structures , have been used to place cosmological constraints .",
    "for example , the shapes of superclusters and voids , using the iras - pscz redshift survey and the abell / aco cluster distribution show a clear preference for a @xmath22-cdm model over a @xmath333 model @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite but see @xcite .",
    "i have attempted to present the basic ideas behind many ( but not all ) of the current methods used to estimate various cosmological parameters , especially the hubble constant ( @xmath20 ) , the curvature of the universe ( @xmath103 ) and its matter content ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "to do so i reviewed some basics of the standard , robertson - walker , cosmology in order to highlight the interrelations of the cosmological parameters and the way they affect the global dynamics of the universe .",
    "the results of a variety of different analyses , based on a multitude of data , point towards a _ concordance _ model , which is a flat , @xmath375 , with an inflationary spectral index @xmath6 , @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 gyr s .",
    "nevertheless there are conceptual problems and open issues that may or may not prove to be daunting .",
    "for example , the @xmath154 , @xmath379 model seems to have problems generating the correct power on galactic scales .",
    "detailed numerical simulations of @xcite show that this model has much more power on small scales to be reconciled with observations ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , there is the fine tuning problem .",
    "why does the energy density of the vacuum have a value like : @xmath380 , implying that it dominates the universe just now ! an easy way out would be to invoke _ anthropic _ arguments @xcite , but it is too feeble a justification , especially since the different contributions to @xmath22 at the early phase transitions are 50 - 100 orders of magnitude larger than what is observed .",
    "one would have to invoke a fine - tuning in order for the different contributions to cancel out , but yet not completely ! however , theoretical models are being developed in an attempt to alleviate such problems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , some by allowing @xmath22 to be a function of time ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "i would like to thank spiros cotsakis and lefteris papandonopulos for organizing this wonderful school and for their hospitality in the island of pythagoras .",
    "i would also like to thank the students of the school for their interest , their stimulating discussions and their ... dancing abilities .",
    "many thanks to ed chapin that had the patience to go through the text and correct my `` greekisms '' .",

    "<S> the following review is based on lectures given in the 1@xmath0 samos cosmology summer school . </S>",
    "<S> it presents an attempt to discuss various issues of current interest in observational cosmology , the selection of which as well as the emphasis given , reflects my own preference and biases . after presenting some cosmological basics , for which i was aided by excellent text - books , </S>",
    "<S> i emphasize on attempts to determine some of the important cosmological parameters ; the hubble constant , the curvature and total mass content of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of these very recent studies is that the _ concordance _ model , that fits the majority of observations , is that with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 and spectral index of primordial fluctuations , the inflationary value @xmath6 . </S>",
