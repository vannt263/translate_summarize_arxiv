    "the equivalent widths ( ) of absorption lines , observed in the spectrum of astronomical sources can be seen as compressed , but highly informative , representation of the whole spectrum .",
    "for example , the  of the absorption lines observed in galaxies spectra reveals insights about their stellar populations , like the ages and metallicities of the stars which dominates the light of the host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . regarding the spectrum of a star ,",
    "it is possible to make use of the  of absorption lines to determine directly the fundamental atmospheric parameters such as : surface gravity ( @xmath2 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) and the chemical abundances of many elements ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , the price to be paid when using the powerful informations contained in the  is the long time needed to make a reliable measurement of this observables .",
    "commonly , the  are measured using interactive routines like _ splot _ provided by the iraf team or with independent codes like liner @xcite .",
    "both softwares are  hand operated \" , which means the user need to look for the line limits and continuum points in the spectrum .",
    "the next step , is to mark them  manually \" .",
    "this procedure is very time - consuming and introduce many uncertainties which are propagated to a posterior analyses of the quantities involving the  measurements .    with the growing of spectral surveys ( e.g. sloan digital sky survey ) , it becomes necessary to accelerate and automate some process such as the analysis of stellar populations of galaxies , as well as the determination of fundamental atmospheric parameters of individual stars . in order to help in such task we present in this paper a new automatic code : _ pacce : perl algorithm to compute continuum and equivalent widths_. this software , written in perl ,",
    "can be used to compute the  of absorption lines as well as to determine continuum points , being very helpful to perform stellar population synthesis following , for example the method developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",

    "the idea behind is to reproduce the  manual \" procedure used to measure the  of absorption lines in a spectrum , as well as to measure mean continuum fluxes in defined regions and compute the continuum value at line center .",
    "in addition , using the same inputs , it does exactly reproduce the measured values being  user \" independent ( e.g. the uncertainties introduced by the user in  hand operated \" procedures are removed ) , and thus allowing for a better comparison between  measured by different users .",

    "in addition , we call the attention to the fact that perl is installed as default in any linux flavor and  can easily be converted to run under microsoft windows system ( without plots ) .            in general , absorption feature indices",
    "are composed by measurements of relative flux in a central wavelength interval corresponding to the absorption feature considered ( line limits @xmath4 and @xmath5 in fig .   [ ew ] ) and two continuum sidebands passband regions ( spectrum ranges - dots - in the boxes of fig .   [ ew ] ) . such sidebands provide a reference level ( pseudo - continuum , solid line fig .

    "computes the pseudo - continuum , @xmath6 , in three ways : ( i ) a linear regression is computed using all the continuum points in the passband regions and a straight line ( y = ax+b ) is computed using the regression coefficients ; ( ii ) a straight line is drawn connecting the mid - points of the flanking passband continuum regions ; ( iii ) as a cubic spline .",
    "the form in which the pseudo - continuum is adjusted is chosen by the user ( see sec .  [ run ] ) .     and @xmath5 .",

    "[ ew ] one can write the area a@xmath11 as : @xmath12 and , thus , the a@xmath13 is the absorbed flux between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , the area below the pseudo - continuum between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is : @xmath14 thus , the  of the absorption line between @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be written as : @xmath15 for more details see for example @xcite .    in",

    "for this purpose we follow @xcite , assuming that the ratio between c and a@xmath7 are similar to the normalized ratio between these quantities ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of linear pseudo - continuum adjustment we estimate the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) as being the ratio between the square root of the variance and the mean flux of the points in the bandpass interval ( i.e. boxes in fig   [ ew ] ) . in the case of a pseudo - continuum defined with a cubic spline the s /",
    "n is calculate in the same way as in the linear adjustment , but using points in a region free from emission / absorption lines defined by the user ( see sec .",

    "the @xmath17 point are calculated following the equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the flux of each @xmath20 in the defined interval and n is the number of points considered .",
    "the errors are estimated as being the square root of the variance .",
    "the continuum at the line center is taken as being the pseudo - continuum flux where @xmath21 .",
    "to run the user needs a ascii , one dimensional , spectrum and a ascii input table containing the line definitions .",
    "the ascii spectrum is easily created using the _ wspectext _ iraf task .",
    "an example of a input table is shown in tab .",
    "note that the continuum points used to determine the line pseudo - continuum can be defined into three different ways ( linear , mid - point or spline ) .",
    "the fact that such input table is very easy to be edited / created , makes  also an interactive tool , allowing for fast changes and tests in  and @xmath17 measurements .    besides the calculations ,  outputs some auxiliary files ( fig .",
    "[ fluxog ] ) .",
