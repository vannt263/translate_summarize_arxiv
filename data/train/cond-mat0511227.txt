    "soon after high - t@xmath3 superconductivity was discovered  @xcite in hole - doped la@xmath4(ba , sr)@xmath5cuo@xmath1 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath7 materials , it was found  @xcite that electron - doped nd@xmath4ce@xmath5cuo@xmath1 also superconducts .",
    "all these substances contain cuo@xmath0 planes separated by block layers containing rare - earth ions , and , moreover , the parent compounds are insulating and exhibit quasi two - dimensional antiferromagnetism",
    ". the generic phase diagrams of electron- and hole - doped cuprates , however , are somewhat different and are not totally symmetric with respect to hole or electron doping .",
    "this is not unexpected since there are quite significant structural differences . in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ,",
    "the copper is six - fold coordinated with oxygens whereas in nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , the apical oxygens are missing . to gain insight into the mechanism(s ) of high - t@xmath3 superconductivity ,",
    "investigations on the origin of similarities and differences between hole- and electron - doped materials are very important .    in a simplistic ionic picture",
    "the valencies of the cu and the o are the same in the insulating state of the parent compounds la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the former substance becomes metallic upon hole doping and it is assumed that the doped hole goes to the planar oxygen sites . on the other hand , in nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , the metallic state is achieved by electron doping and the doped electrons are assumed to reside on the copper sites .",
    "electronic structure calculations  @xcite in the framework of the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave method within the local density approximation have shown very similar band structures for nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "details of the influence of electron or hole doping in these materials , however , can not be obtained from band structure calculations except in the approximation of rigid bands . in contrast , cluster calculations are ideally suited for investigations of how the local electronic structure is influenced by doping . using two different methods of simulating doping , we have previously shown  @xcite",
    "that simulations of hole doping in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 provide insight into the changes in the population of various orbitals on the copper and oxygen atoms .",
    "both methods yielded on the whole the same results and the changes calculated for the electric field gradient ( efg ) at the copper agreed with experiments .",
    "parts of this work deal with an adaptation of these methods to the case of the electron - doped cuprate nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "a large body of data obtained by nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) gives detailed information on the changes of the efg values in all high t@xmath3 superconductors .",
    "several nmr experiments were performed in the electron - doped nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1  compound  @xcite , the pr@xmath8lace@xmath5cuo@xmath9 material  @xcite , the infinite layer compound  @xcite sr@xmath8la@xmath5cuo@xmath0 , and its parent compound  @xcite srcuo@xmath0 .",
    "the first surprising feature of these results is a relatively low @xmath10cu nqr frequency ( @xmath11 ) measured in the undoped parent compound compared to the hole doped compounds . in the undoped parent compounds the quadrupolar frequency has been measured to be 14  mhz for the the nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1  compound and 7.4 mhz in the infinite layer .",
    "this is less by more than a factor of two than in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1  ( 33.0 mhz ( ref .  ) ) and yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath12  ( 31.5 mhz ( ref .  ) ) compounds .",
    "the second striking feature of all these experiments is the extreme sensitivity of @xmath11 on the doping level .",
    "@xmath11 is @xmath13 2 mhz for nd@xmath14ce@xmath15cuo@xmath1 ( ref .  ) , @xmath13 0.5 mhz in pr@xmath16lace@xmath17cuo@xmath9 ( ref .  ) and finally @xmath13 3 mhz in sr@xmath18la@xmath19cuo@xmath0 ( ref .  ) .",
    "this strong doping dependence of the field gradient in the electron - doped compounds has been explained by a simplistic ionic model .",
    "it was shown to be due to fully occupied 3d@xmath20 orbitals which give no contribution to the field gradient if all 3d orbitals are occupied .    in the present work we report on cluster calculations of the local electronic structure in nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and its changes upon electron doping .",
    "the results are compared to those for hole - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the contributions to the efg are studied in detail and it is explained why the efg values in nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 are much smaller than in the hole - doped substances .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : clustermodel ] we present the details of the technique of the cluster calculations . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] the results for the electronic structure including the charge distribution , the efg and their comparison to nmr experiments are given .",
    "especially , in sec .",
    "[ sec : orbital ] , results for the chemical shieldings at the copper sites in undoped nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 are presented and are compared to results obtained from nmr experiments . the results for the spin density distribution and the calculation of magnetic hyperfine couplings are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin ] .",
    "[ sec : summary ] contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "the idea of the cluster method is to solve the many - body schrdinger equation for a portion of the crystal which we call the cluster .",
    "a cluster is a careful selection of a contiguous group of ions within a solid .",
    "the specific choice of the atoms that make up a cluster is such that it allows predominantly localized properties of a target atom and its vicinity to be calculated .",
    "a property is called _ local _ if it can be determined by the electronic structure of a few neighboring atoms in the crystal .",
    "electric field gradients ( efg ) and hyperfine fields are such local properties and have been successfully calculated by the cluster method ( see for example refs .",
    "a cluster consists of three regions .",
    "the target atom and at least its nearest neighboring atoms form the center of the cluster and the corresponding electrons are treated most accurately using first - principles all - electron methods .",
    "this core region is embedded in a large cloud of a few thousand point charges at the respective lattice sites imitating the madelung potential .",
    "point charges at the border of the core region are replaced by basis - free pseudopotentials to improve the boundary conditions for the electrons in the cluster core .",
    "these pseudopotentials make up the so - called screening region",
    ".    it would be desirable to have clusters that contain as many atoms as possible in the core region but there are two computational limitations to the cluster size : the available computer resources and the convergence of the self - consistent field procedure .",
    "however , these limits have been pushed further since our first use of the cluster technique ( see ref .  ) which now allows the computation of larger clusters and hence improve the bulk - to - surface ratio .",
    ".compilation of the clusters used for nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1  and some of their defining properties : number of atoms simulated by a full basis set ( @xmath21 ) , number of electrons ( @xmath22 ) and number of basis functions ( @xmath23 ) .

    "spin - polarized ab - initio calculations have been performed to determine the local electronic structure of nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 using clusters comprising 5 , 9 , and 13 copper atoms in the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "electron doping has been simulated by two different approaches which both yield the same results .",
    "the local charge distribution has been discussed in detail in terms of the partial mulliken populations of the individual atomic orbitals .",
    "the changes in the partial populations of the relevant aos ( 3d@xmath20 , 3d@xmath24 , and @xmath25 ) that occur upon doping are relatively small but significant . both @xmath26(3d@xmath20 ) and @xmath26(@xmath25 ) slightly increase and @xmath26(3d@xmath24 ) is significantly less than 2 .",
    "electric field gradients depend sensitively on the non - spherical local charge distribution .",
    "the individual contributions to the efg have been discussed in detail and the resulting value for the nuclear quadrupole frequency is in good agreement with the experiments . the comparatively small value and the changes upon doping have been explained by the differences in the occupation numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are close to the partial mulliken populations @xmath26 .",
    "the local electronic structure of nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 has been compared to that of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "hole doping in the latter material mainly decreases the population @xmath26(3d@xmath20 ) and @xmath26(@xmath25 ) but there is also a slight decrease of @xmath26(3d@xmath24 ) and @xmath29 of the apical oxygen .",
    "the different values in the efg at the copper sites observed in the various cuprates can be understood by the difference in the partial mulliken population @xmath26(3d@xmath24)@xmath30(3d@xmath20 ) .",
    "the calculated spin density distribution in nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is not much different from that determined for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and yba@xmath0cuo@xmath31 .",
    "the analysis of the magnetic hyperfine couplings , which is based on the dependence of the contact and dipolar spin densities also yields values which are of similar magnitudes to those in hole doped materials .",
