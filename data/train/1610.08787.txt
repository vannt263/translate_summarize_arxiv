    "partition density - functional theory ( pdft ) @xcite is a reformulation of dft in which the total ground - state energy and density of a molecular system ( molecules , clusters ) are found indirectly , but in principle _ exactly _ , via self - consistent calculations on isolated fragments .",
    "in addition to sharing many of the appealing features of density - based embedding methods @xcite , pdft can be used to formulate chemical - reactivity theory ( crt ) without the inconsistencies of previous formulations @xcite , and it can be used to circumvent some of the limitations of approximate exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "for example , it was recently shown how a very simple approximation in pdft can fix almost entirely the delocalization and static - correlation errors of approximate dft calculations on stretched molecules @xcite .    at present , pdft has been applied only to diatomic molecules @xcite ( h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , he@xmath6 , be@xmath6 , lih , li@xmath6 ) , and model chains of hydrogen atoms containing non interacting electrons @xcite . we apply it here for the first time to a molecular cluster .",
    "our goals are : ( 1 ) to demonstrate convergence of the pdft equations for a 2-fragment molecular cluster when a popular hybrid exchange - correlation functional and gaussian basis set are used ; ( 2 ) to demonstrate convergence of the pdft equations as the ground - state symmetry group of the water dimer changes with the separation between the monomers ; and ( 3 ) to illustrate some of the chemical interpretations that can be drawn from a pdft calculation .",
    "pdft has much in common with related density - based embedding methods , such as subsystem - dft @xcite .",
    "however , there is an important difference . in standard subsystem - dft",
    "each fragment has its own embedding potential independent of the other fragments while in pdft all fragments share a global partition potential . at first glance",
    ", the subsystem - dft picture may seem more intuitive because it is surprising that the same potential could correctly deform both fragments so that they add to yield the supermolecular density .",
    "it turns out that it is not only possible for a single global potential to acomplish this task , but it forces the solution to be unique .",
    "while exact subsystem - dft calculations which can reproduce ks - dft calculations via fragment calculations are possible and have been done @xcite , the resulting potentials and fragment densities depend either on the choice of frozen density , or on the initial guess in the case that freeze - thaw cycles are used . in this work , the fragment densities and the partition potential are unique @xcite . in the work of huang and carter @xcite , uniqueness is imposed as an explicit constraint . for fragments with integer numbers of electrons , as here , their method is equivalent to pdft .",
    "however , the calculations of ref.@xcite were performed using a plane - wave basis and it is of interest to examine convergence with gaussian basis sets .",
    "the water dimer is of course an extremely well - studied system@xcite .",
    "it is the building unit for larger water clusters and the archetypal example of a hydrogen bond , which could be characterized as a medium - strength intermolecular interaction .",
    "hydrogen bonds in water lead to a large number of unusual macroscopic properties@xcite ( when compared to molecules of similar structure or mass@xcite ) that have profound implications for the regulation of the temperature on earth , the ability of life to thrive under frozen and extreme environments and , more generally , life as we know it @xcite .",
    "currently there are two ways of understanding the stabilization in hydrogen bonds of the general y@xmath7h  x type , with x and y being electronegative atoms ( oxygens in the case of the water dimer ) . in the traditional description of electrostatic interaction between partial charges , illustrated at the top panel of figure",

    "we are also interested in how the fragment densities deform from the isolated monomer densities .",
    "we denote @xmath26 the energy of the isolated water monomer , which allows us to define the _ preparation energy _ of the acceptor unit as the energy needed to take it from the geometry and charge distribution of the isolated water monomer to the acceptor geometry and charge distribution in the dimer , @xmath27 = e_a[n_a]-e_a^0   \\label{eq : eprep}\\ ] ] with a similar definition for the donor .",
    "thus , the total preparation energy for the water dimer is their sum @xmath28=e_{{\\rm prep},a}[n_a]+e_{{\\rm prep},d}[n_b ]   \\label{eq : tpe}\\ ] ] as is usual , the binding energy of the dimer is calculated as the difference between the energy of the dimer and the energy of the isolated monomers : @xmath29 the partition potential , @xmath30 , is common to both the acceptor and donor units and emerges as the lagrange multiplier ensuring that the sum of the fragment densities matches the total density of the interacting dimer .",
    "the partition potential can be related to functional derivatives of @xmath31 ; however , because its exact form is not known , iterative methods for optimizing @xmath32 have been developed.@xcite these involve writing @xmath32 as linear combinations of basis functions and directly optimizing the coefficients so that the the sum of fragment densities matches a precalcuated supermolecular density , @xmath33 when projected onto the basis functions of @xmath32 .",
    "the optimization of the coefficients in the expansion for the partition potential can proceed via two algorithms . in the simpler of the two algorithms ,",
    "each coefficient representing the partition potential is updated using the equation    @xmath34    where the @xmath15 index runs over the partition potential basis functions , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the basis function coefficients obtained by projecting the fragment density , @xmath38 and the target supermolecular density , @xmath33 , onto the partition potential basis set .",
    "@xmath39 is a small positive constant which controls convergence .",
    "typically , @xmath39 may be chosen to be around @xmath40 , but depending on the system or geometry certain values of @xmath39 will not converge . however , we found faster and more robust convergence by using the sum of fragment density responses , @xmath41 , projected onto the partition potential basis . by inverting this matrix",
    "we obtain a first order estimate of how to change the partition potential coefficients in order to zero the difference between the sum of fragment densities and the target density .",
    "@xmath42    the partition potential was expanded in terms of two different types of basis sets : 5 cartesian gaussian functions centered at each atom , and dunning s aug  cc  pvtz basis set .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ f : vpbasiscompare ] that expanding the partition potential over the aug  cc ",
    "pvtz basis set allows the fragment densities to better match the total density .",
    "therefore , this basis set is used for the rest of the calculations in this work .",
    "all calculations were carried out using our pdft implementation in the nwchem package.@xcite    we separately optimized the water dimer in @xmath4 and @xmath1 symmetries ( figure [ f : cs_water_dimer ] ) using second - order perturbation theory ( mp2 ) and the b3lyp functional in conjunction with the aug - cc - pvtz basis set .",
    "as expected , negligible differences in the geometries were obtained with the two methods .",
    "thus , in what follows , we use the mp2 geometries .",
    "a number of rigid and relaxed scans of the separation distance between the monomers were carried out using b3lyp . in order to construct the effective potentials of equation [ eq : ep ] , the b3lyp exchange correlation functional",

    "@xmath43 is slightly smaller than @xmath44 .",
    "this means that the proton donor in the hydrogen bond reorganizes its charge density to a larger extent , due to the intermolecular interaction . from the orbital perspective , this makes perfect sense as this unit has to accommodate the electron charge being donated to the @xmath45 orbital .",
    ".energies ( a.u . ) for pdft ( b3lyp / aug  cc  pvtz ) calculations on the @xmath4 and @xmath1 equilibrium geometries of the water dimer ( figure [ f : cs_water_dimer ] ) .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the same conclusions are drawn from calculations employing lda or hartree fock exchange . however , lda overestimates @xmath49 by 2.4 kcal / mol , while hf underestimates it by 3.1 kcal / mol with respect to the experimental value ( 5.4 @xmath50 0.7 kcal / mol@xcite ) .",
    "thus , in what follows we use b3lyp for all calculations .",
    "the total preparation energy is small ( @xmath51 a.u . ) . for diatomic molecules , the character of the bond seems to be related to the magnitude of the preparation energy : nafziger and coworkers @xcite reported preparation energies for he@xmath6 ( van der waals bond ) , lih ionic fragments ( ionic bond ) , lih neutral fragments ( ionic bond ) , and h@xmath6 ( covalent bond ) of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 a.u .",
    "respectively at the equilibrium distances . our results for the water dimer at the same level of theory ( @xmath56 a.u .",
    ") nicely falls in the intermediate region between a long range van der waals bond and an ionic bond .",
    "this intermediate nature of the hydrogen bond in water clusters is well documented .",
    "@xcite    it can be argued that in general , in interacting systems , when the fragments retain their identities to high degrees ( weak interactions ) , preparation energies should be smaller than in systems where the units are significantly changed from their isolated forms ( medium to strong interactions ) . since the preparation energy is able to describe the relative strengths of bonding , a pdft calculation gives insight into the nature of the interaction .",
    "next , we focus on the changes in preparation and partition energies as a function of the intermolecular distance",
    ". relaxation along the @xmath4 path leads the system to change its symmetry to @xmath1 at short distances as shown in figure [ f : scans ] .",
    "the @xmath1 dimer contains doubly hydrogen bonded water molecules ( both molecules act as simultaneous acceptor / donor of hydrogen bonds ) , while @xmath0 has a single hydrogen bond .",
    "this is a well known fact , pointed out among others by burnham and xantheas@xcite who reported that the @xmath57 transition occurs around @xmath58  .",
    "while @xmath49 remains continous through this transition , @xmath59 and @xmath60 have a discontinuity",
    ". however , symmetry  constrained scans of the separation distance avoid the symmetry crossing and allow us to analyze the changes in preparation and partition energies within fixed symmetries ( figure [ f : scans ] ) .",
    "intra - fragment nuclear re - arrangement would introduce a small positive change in the preparation energy , because the fragment energy would be slightly further from the ground state of the isolated system .",
    "it would also have a slightly larger negative effect on the partition energy for a small net lowering of the total energy .",
    "however , these small effects are ignored due to the fixed intrafragment geometry .",
    "the preparation energy is always positive and decays rapidly with separation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the preparation energy of the monomers in the @xmath1 isomer is significantly smaller than in the @xmath4 case ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this indicates that the work involved in deforming the monomers in the @xmath1 isomer with a double hydrogen bond is smaller than the work needed to deform the isolated monomers in the @xmath4 isomer with a single hydrogen bond .",
    "this lines up with the orbital picture because as can be seen in figure [ f : cs_water_dimer ] , all orbitals involved have the correct symmetries and energies , but for the @xmath1 case , the @xmath62 overlap is significantly smaller .",
    "in addition , for the @xmath1 case , the orbitals involved in one hydrogen bond may interfere in a non  constructive way with the orbitals in the second hydrogen bond , resulting in a smaller change in fragment density . the smaller preparation energy ( smaller change in fragment density ) for the @xmath1 isomer is also reflected in the smaller changes in the magnitudes of the dipole moments of the monomers ( in fact , the changes in the @xmath9 , @xmath8 monomers cancel out such that the total dipole moment remains unchanged ) as compared to the monomers in the @xmath4 dimer , depicted in figure [ f : dm_cs_c2h ] .",

    "figure [ f : vp_plots ] visualizes @xmath30 for the @xmath4-equilibrium geometry in three different ways : a 3d surface , a 2d contour plot on the plane defined by the donor molecule that also contains the oxygen atom in the acceptor unit , and a one - dimensional cut along the bonding @xmath64axis .",
    "positive ( red ) regions of the potential are associated with charge deficiency while negative ( blue ) regions of the potential are associated with excess charge .",
    "if the monomers are separated by very long distances , the entire surface is green ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "what is observed in the 3d surfaces is that , in agreement with the orbital view of hydrogen bonding ( figure [ f : cs_water_dimer ] ) , charge is transferred from @xmath9 to @xmath8 .",
    "the 2d contour plot ( aug  cc  pvtz expansion of @xmath30 ) implies that the largest deficiency in charge appears to be at the oxygen atom in the acceptor molecule , precisely at the position of the lone pair .",
    "it is also shown in figure [ f : dens_plots ] that the most gain in charge in the donor molecule occurs in the region of the @xmath45 orbital .",
    "the bonding region is conveniently described by the one - dimensional plot along the bonding @xmath64axis : as in the cases of the diatomic molecules mentioned above , @xcite the partition potential is somewhat diminished in the bonding region , decreasing in the o1@xmath66h5 direction , which we associate with the electron flux due to the @xmath67 charge transfer .",
