    "<S> here we demonstrate experimentally that photoconductivity in a model organic optoelectronic device can be controlled by the selective excitation of molecular vibrations . using an ultrafast infrared laser source to create a coherent superposition of vibrational motions in a pentacene / c60 photoresistor </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that excitation of certain modes in the @xmath0{cm^{-1}}$ ] region leads to photocurrent enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> excited vibrations affect predominantly trapped carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the effect depends on the nature of the vibration and its mode - specific character can be well described by the vibrational modulation of intermolecular electronic couplings . </S>",
    "<S> vibrational control thus presents a new tool for studying electron - phonon coupling and charge dynamics in ( bio)molecular materials . </S>",
    "<S> + * submitted * : nov . </S>",
    "<S> 11 , 2014 + * revised * : feb . 3 , 2015    the soft character of organic materials strongly influences their electronic functionality . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in these systems charge hopping and electronic delocalization are determined by the overlap of the molecular orbitals and , therefore , is highly sensitive to minor changes in molecular geometry . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the electronic properties of organic materials are largely determined by the interplay between the electronic and nuclear dynamics of the molecules , referred to as vibronic coupling phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> a growing number of interdisciplinary studies show that vibronic effects lie at the heart of a diverse class of effects in physics , chemistry and biology - from non - linear behavior of molecular junctions @xcite to photophysics of vision @xcite and even olfactory reception . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite vibrational motions have been postulated to regulate the interaction between different molecular electronic states by modulating inter- and intra - molecular couplings , by donating or accepting extra energy quanta @xcite , and by suppressing @xcite or promoting @xcite quantum interference phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> vibronic effects were also shown to be fundamentally important for the conductivity of organic materials . </S>",
    "<S> vibrational motions influence intermolecular electron tunneling probabilities @xcite and govern a variety of non - equilibrium phenomena such as local heating @xcite , switching @xcite , hysteresis , and electronic decoherence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this makes vibrational excitation a promising tool for spectroscopy of molecular junctions @xcite , tracking charge transfer processes in organic- and bio - electronic systems , and , more generally , for the development of electronic devices . for example , remarkable opportunities for organic electronics would arise from the possibility to control charge transport , and , thus , affect device performance by coherently driving nuclear motions along a pre - selected reaction coordinate trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite many encouraging theoretical predictions @xcite the experimental realization of vibrationally controlled electronics is still elusive due to the complexity of selective control of nuclear motions in an actual electronic junction .    until now </S>",
    "<S> , vibration - associated charge dynamics in organic electronic devices have been only controlled with approaches that do not include mode selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the density and the equilibrium population of vibrational states have been varied via chemical synthesis of molecules with different bond structures @xcite and via thermal population of low - frequency vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , in principle , it should be possible to access particular non - equilibrium nuclear or vibronic states by using instrumentation of optical time - resolved techniques , like visible pump - probe @xcite , time - resolved stimulated / impulsive raman @xcite , or transient ir absorption @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for inorganic perovskite materials @xcite and molecular mott insulators @xcite it has been reported that selective ir excitation can lead to strong modulation of the electronic properties by inducing a lattice phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> sophisticated all - optical two - dimensional ( 2d ) photon echo techniques are even capable of guiding a molecular system through a desired quantum superposition of vibronic / vibrational states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although such spectroscopic methods provide a comprehensive approach for probing and controlling molecular motions and have been applied to model systems such as molecular thin films or solutions , they have not yet been employed to control functional electronic ( nano)devices .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we combine device characterization and ultrafast - spectroscopy methods to experimentally demonstrate that the performance of an organic optoelectronic system can be controlled by selectively exciting vibrational modes of the molecules involved in charge transport . as model system we use pentacene / c60 bi - layer photoresistors . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental approach is based on the interferometric extension of the pump - push photocurrent ( ppp ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in a ppp experiment , an optoelectronic device is illuminated by a sequence of laser pulses interacting with the active material in the device . </S>",
    "<S> the result of these interactions is detected by observing the variations in the current flow through the device as a function of time delay @xmath1 between the pump and push pulses and their spectra . </S>",
    "<S> thus , ppp combines the sensitivity and device relevance of electronic methods with the excitation selectivity and ultrafast time resolution of optical methods . since its introduction @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> ppp has been applied and discussed in the context of photovoltaics @xcite , nanoelectronics , spectroscopy @xcite , microscopy @xcite , and molecular junction research @xcite . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we extend the ppp method , using the recent progress in ultrafast interferometry @xcite that allows for a precise control over the time / frequency - domain structure of the ir optical pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a sequence of ultrafast mid - ir laser pulses to create a coherent superposition of molecular vibrational motions inside the active layer of a device and correlate this excitation with the device performance .     </S>",

    "<S> the active layer of the device consists of polycrystalline pentacene ( @xmath4{nm}$ ] ) and fullerene c60 ( @xmath5{nm}$ ] ) films ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] a ) ) , thermally evaporated on top of 3- , 5- or @xmath6{\\upmu m}$ ] spaced electrodes arranged in a comb - like geometry on a sio@xmath7 substrate ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we chose this geometry rather than a sandwich - like structure , typical for photodiodes or solar cells , to improve the access of mid - ir pump - pulses to the active layer . adding the c60 layer was critical to enhance the photocarrier generation in the film . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    figure [ fig1 ] d ) compares the absorption spectra of pentacene and c60 in the ir vibrational fingerprint region and in the region of the optical electronic transitions . </S>",
    "<S> c60 shows several distinct vibrational modes at @xmath8{cm^{-1}}$ ] , @xmath9{cm^{-1}}$ ] , and @xmath10{cm^{-1}}$ ] and has a comparably low optical density in the visible . </S>",
    "<S> pentacene has a rich spectrum of vibrational lines in the ir and also shows strong excitonic absorption features at frequencies above @xmath11{cm^{-1}}$ ] ( @xmath12{nm}$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to density functional theory calculations , the strong ir peaks at 1300 and @xmath13{cm^{-1}}$ ] are mostly associated with @xmath14 stretching vibrations along the short axis of pentacene , while the weaker high - frequency vibrations correspond to atomic motions mostly aligned with the long axis of the molecule ( see si ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the dark i - v curves of the devices are symmetric and roughly linear , indicating good hole injection from the gold electrodes to the pentacene layer ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> upon exposure to visible light , the current flow through the devices strongly increases ( @xmath15 times under @xmath6{mw / cm^2}$ ] illumination ) . </S>",
    "<S> devices without a c60 layer demonstrated only negligible photoconductivity , which indicates that singlet ( and triplet ) @xcite excitons generated after pentacene excitation are dissociating at the pentacene / c60 interface and that the charge generation proceeds through the interfacial charge transfer states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to the large electron injection barrier at the pentacene / au interface , the dark current is mostly provided by holes , while under illumination both holes and electrons contribute to the photocurrent . unlike in a typical solar cell , both electrodes are placed below the pentacene films . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , electrons and holes have to pass through the pentacene , which is known to lead to extremely long ( up to seconds ) extraction times of electrons residing in low - lying trap states in pentacene . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this notion is confirmed by the dependence of the photocurrent on the light - modulation frequency ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> cole - cole analysis of this dependence shows a typical time constant @xmath16{ms}$ ] , which we interpret as the lifetime of long - lived electronic charge carriers .        </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] a ) shows the layout of the experiment , designed to observe the effect of molecular vibrations on the charge transport through the device . </S>",
    "<S> the setup combines a @xmath17{khz}$ ] visible - infrared ultrafast spectrometer and a lock - in current probe station wired to the device under @xmath18{v}$ ] external bias . </S>",
    "<S> first , a visible ( @xmath19{cm^{-1}}$ ] ; @xmath20{nm}$ ] ; @xmath21{ev}$ ] ) pump pulse illuminates the device . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption of the pump light in pentacene leads to the build - up of excitons and charge carriers in the active layer . </S>",
    "<S> the generated carriers produce a sequence of @xmath17{ms}$]-spaced current pulses in the measurement circuit with an average photocurrent @xmath22{na}$ ] , detected by the lock - in amplifier at @xmath17{khz}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that at such low current densities a charge - induced phase transition @xcite can be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> the device is irradiated with a push pulse at certain delay times @xmath1 before or after the pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the push pulse can promote @xmath23 of the molecules to the excited vibrational state and can also excite low - frequency charge - associated ir electronic transitions . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the effect of ir light on the charge separation and transport was detected via the variation of device photocurrent @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] c ) presents a typical ppp transient , measured with a single - pulse push ( one interferometer arm blocked ) at @xmath25{cm^{-1}}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> when the pump was blocked we observed no signal due to the push only . at negative delay time @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> when the push pulse arrives before the pump , we already observe a substantial increase of the current due to ir excitation ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we associate this response with the excitation of long - lived photocarriers that were generated by the preceding pump pulse that arrives @xmath27{ms}$ ] earlier . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is in line with the long collection times of trapped carriers observed for electrons in pentacene . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at delay time @xmath28 , the ppp response promptly increases as the concentration of charges in the cell rises due to the arrival of the new pump pulse and the ir push influences their dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid rise is followed by a @xmath29{ps}$ ] decay component that we assign to the geminate recombination of newly generated charge pairs , which are likely to form electrostatically bound charge - transfer excitons . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in a broadband experiment using a single - pulse push , it is not possible to distinguish the effects of low - frequency electronic excitations from the vibronic phenomena associated with the interference between the molecular vibrational motions and charge dynamics . to separate and address these phenomena individually , </S>",
    "<S> we performed push - frequency resolved measurements by exploiting the ultrafast interferometry approach . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using a mach - zehnder scheme ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] a ) ) , the push beam is split into two pulses displaced in time by an interferometric delay @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the formation of a 1/@xmath30 periodic modulation in the total push spectrum ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) which allows for selective excitation of different coherent superpositions of modes within the bandwidth of the ir light . in a typical experiment , for a certain pump - push delay </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 , the signal @xmath31 is detected as a function of interferometric delay @xmath30 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained interferogram is fourier - transformed along the @xmath30 axis to yield the action spectrum of the push effect .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] e ) shows a typical frequency - resolved ppp response of a pentacene / c60 device at negative and positive pump - push delay times @xmath1 , and with no pump ( dark ) . at both delays the response consists of a number of narrow peaks on top of a broad featureless response , roughly following the ir source spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we associate the broad feature with intraband electronic and polaronic absorption , which typically spreads between 1000 and @xmath32{cm^{-1}}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the intraband excitation brings the associated charge carriers to a higher - lying delocalized state , thereby enhancing their mobility , decreasing their recombination , and thus increasing the current output . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the narrow features in the ppp signal match well with the absorption peaks of the vibrational modes of pentacene and c60 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore these features in the frequency - resolved ppp response are assigned to the excitation of molecular vibrations that modulate the electronic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the broad electronic response dominates the ppp signal when the push arrives after the pump , while the vibrational features have similar amplitudes ( within the experimental accuracy ) at positive and negative @xmath1 delays . </S>",
    "<S> this observation indicates that the ir electronic excitation substantially promotes charge separation at the pentacene / c60 interface , soon after exciton generation . at the same time , the effect of vibrational excitation is present for long - lived trapped charge carriers and , therefore , does not influence charge separation , but only carrier de - trapping dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    </S>",
    "<S> we now focus on the analysis of the vibrational features only . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of broadband electronic ir excitation on charge dynamics in organic semiconductors has been investigated previously @xcite , and is outside the scope of this paper . to study the effect of vibrational excitation for a broader set of vibrational modes , we use a wide push spectral window of @xmath33{cm^{-1}}$ ] and long @xmath30-scanning to obtain high frequency resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we also applied time - domain filtering ( see si ) to suppress broad features due to electronic excitation and non - linear field - induced tunneling currents .     </S>",
    "<S> experimental evaluation of vibrational control effect : ( a ) the vibrational part of the ppp response , measured at negative delay time ( @xmath34{ps}$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the signal amplitude is normalized to the spectral density of the ir push source . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is obtained using two ppp spectra , each covering a different but overlapping wavenumber range ; these are scaled to match the amplitude of the @xmath9{cm^{-1}}$ ] mode that is present in both spectra . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the absorption spectrum of the pentacene / c60 layer is presented in red . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the influence of different vibrations on device photocurrent , estimated by normalizing the amplitude of the ppp signal to the absorbed ir intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the change of photocurrent absolute value corresponds to a flat @xmath35{j / cm^2}$ ] per @xmath36 spectral density of exciting ir light , fully absorbed by the vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars are calculated from standard deviations for measurements on different devices ; the number of measurements was 10 for @xmath37{cm^{-1}}$ ] modes and 4 for all other modes . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] a ) presents the vibration - associated ppp spectrum covering most of the ir fingerprint frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the ppp response was normalized to the spectral density of the push pulse to allow for a direct comparison of the different vibrational lines . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is the result of several measurements with different push frequencies spliced together to match the amplitude of the effect for the @xmath9{cm^{-1}}$ ] feature , which was present in all measurements . in the @xmath33{cm^{-1}}$ ] region , we observe twelve ppp peaks at frequencies that match well the ir - active vibrational modes of pentacene and c60 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that , while the vibrations of charged pentacene may differ from those of the neutral molecules @xcite , these differences should not be observed in the ppp data . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the shift in frequency for most individual modes is small @xcite and , for most modes , below our frequency resolution ( @xmath38{cm^{-1}}$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is also supported by dft calculations , see suppl . </S>",
    "<S> information , tables s1 and s2 . secondly , the minor shifts of the vibrational levels lead to a highly efficient vibrational energy transfer @xcite between neutral and charged molecules , which allows the vibrational excitation of neutral pentacene to be delivered to the charge trapping sites . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , according to miller - abrahams formalism , when a carrier hops from a radical to a neutral state all vibrational modes coupled to these electronic states contribute to the transfer rate . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite therefore , it is not surprising that the lattice vibrations , i.e. those of the neutral pentacene , are observed in the detrapping dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the amplitude of the ppp response does not follow the intensity of the ir absorption . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the band at @xmath13{cm^{-1}}$ ] possesses a much stronger ir absorption than the @xmath39{cm^{-1}}$ ] vibration , but shows a weaker ppp response . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows that the observed ppp response can not be explained by the equilibration of vibrational energy between modes and average heating of the device active layer , thus illustrating the mode - selective character of the ppp response . </S>",
    "<S> this example illustrates that different atomic motions couple differently to the charge dynamics of the system . to exclude that the non - scaling of the ppp response with ir absorption is merely an effect of a different orientation of the vibration dipoles with respect to the exciting ir light </S>",
    "<S> , we also performed angle - dependent ir absorption measurements . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements showed that the modes exhibiting very different ppp effect , e.g. at @xmath13{cm^{-1}}$ ] and @xmath39{cm^{-1}}$ ] , have similar dipole orientations ( see si ) , which rules out orientation effects .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] b ) compares the effect of vibrational excitation on the device photoconductivity for different vibrational modes , obtained by normalizing the ppp response to the number of photons absorbed by the vibrational mode . in accordance with figure 3a , </S>",
    "<S> the 1300 and @xmath13{cm^{-1}}$ ] modes show the weakest coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the higher - frequency vibrations of pentacene show a 5 - 8 times higher effect on the photoconductivity . for two of the fullerene vibrations </S>",
    "<S> the effect is similar to that of the high - frequency vibrational modes of pentacene .    </S>",
    "<S> these results can be rationalized in the framework of the phonon - assisted miller - abrahams ( ma ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite according to this model , carrier hopping from a trapping state to higher - energy ( more conducting ) states takes place via absorption of a phonon with energy @xmath40 to compensate for the energy difference between initial and final electronic states ; the hopping rate @xmath41 is defined by the electron - vibrational coupling constant ( @xmath42 ) and the occupation number ( @xmath43 ) of the absorbed phonon , i.e. @xmath44 in thermal equilibrium , the occupation number of a high - energy molecular vibration is very small : @xmath45 for a comprehensive description of the ppp response the interaction with the ir photons should be included into the ma model . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the conceptual level the effect can be understood by assuming that an ir excitation creates a non - equilibrium population of the molecular vibrational manifold ; therefore , an increase in the hopping probability is expected . </S>",
    "<S> the mode - selective character of the ppp response is therefore defined by the electron - vibration coupling constants .        to achieve mechanistic insight into the observed phenomena we performed a theoretical analysis of the coupling between the different molecular vibrations and the charge carriers ( holes ) in pentacene . in molecular systems </S>",
    "<S> these couplings can be divided into two types , i.e. local ( holstein - type ) and non - local ( peierls - type ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the holstein electron - phonon interaction originates from the modulation of the site energies by the vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> only totally symmetric molecular vibration modes can contribute to this interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for centrosymmetric molecules like pentacene , the symmetric modes are not ir - active and will not absorb ir photons , so that we can rule out holstein electron - phonon coupling effects in the ppp response . </S>",
    "<S> the peierls - type electron - phonon couplings are associated with the dependence of the transfer integrals on the distances between adjacent molecules and their relative orientations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for this type of coupling , there are no symmetry restrictions .    </S>",
