    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is usually invoked to solve the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) . because such models are so theoretically compelling , many believe that susy must be found in nature , and much work has gone into elucidating various aspects of such theories .    in susy theories each ordinary fermion and gauge boson has a superpartner , respectively of spin 0 and spin @xmath4 .",
    "these models contain a large number of unknown parameters .",
    "many of these parameters can be complex , so that , in general , susy theories predict large cp - violating effects due to the presence of susy particles .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to begin a systematic high - energy exploration of cp violation in susy couplings .",
    "that is , throughout this paper we assume that the cp - conserving parameters are known , but that those which violate cp remain to be measured .",
    "of course , most measurements will not probe single cp - violating susy phases .",
    "however , if one makes many measurements , then the combined effect will be to measure or constrain all susy phases .",
    "the low - energy cp - violating properties of the couplings of superparticles have been explored .",
    "for example , constraints due to electric dipole moments ( edms ) have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "contributions to meson mixing have also been investigated  @xcite , and the effect of susy theories on cp violation in the @xmath5-meson system has been examined  @xcite .",
    "the edm experiments are particularly constraining and have led to the so - called susy cp problem  if sfermion masses are of order the weak scale and complex susy parameters have phases of order unity , calculations of edms generically yield values in excess of the experimental limits .",
    "furthermore , the experimental limits are expected to be improved substantially over the next few years , which will lead to further constraints on the susy parameter space  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of edms are highly model - dependent , and there are several scenarios in which the problem is ameliorated  @xcite .",
    "for example , one simple way to avoid the susy cp problem is to assume that sfermion masses are of order the weak scale , but that all relevant cp - odd phases are highly suppressed .",
    "another is to adopt the opposite stance , taking the phases to be of order unity , but sfermion masses to be very large ( of order several tev ) .",
    "scenarios have also been studied in which only the first- and second - generation sfermions are very heavy , but the third - generation sfermions are near the electroweak scale . in other cases ,",
    "authors have made assumptions concerning universality or alignment of various soft - susy - breaking terms .",
    "finally , in principle there could be substantial cancellations between different diagrams , leading to a reduction in the edms .",
    "assuming that susy particles are found , it will be necessary to measure the cp - violating properties of their couplings in order to get a complete picture of the physical susy model .",
    "several studies have already been performed , showing how high - energy observables could be used to measure or constrain various susy phases  @xcite . in the present work we consider cp - odd asymmetries related to a particular decay mode of the heavier top squark in susy .",
    "the observables that we consider are sensitive primarily to parameters associated with the third - generation squarks .",
    "edms can in principle constrain quantities associated with the third generation . ( for example , the two - loop bar - zee - type diagrams considered in ref .",
    "@xcite can directly constrain the cp - violating parameters related to the third generation squarks . )",
    "we will assume that the susy parameters that we use , as well as those not directly involved in our calculation ( i.e. , those corresponding to the first two generations ) , are such that the various edm constraints are not violated .",
    "our point of view is that our observables may be used to provide an _ independent _ measurement of relevant cp - odd susy parameters .",
    "such measurements would be complementary to the constraints coming from low - energy observables such as edms or meson mixing .",
    "if indeed the edm constraints end up predicting particular values for the parameters we consider , then a high - energy measurement should verify such predictions .    in susy theories",
    ", there are two higgs doublets . as a result , there are three neutral higgs bosons  two scalars and one pseudoscalar . if cp is violated , when one evolves from the gauge basis to the mass basis , these neutral particles can mix , so that the couplings of the physical higgs bosons are generally mixtures of scalar and pseudoscalar . recently ,",
    "it was shown that this mixing could be probed in the process @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the measurement of such a mixing would be one signal of cp violation in susy theories .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite note that this signal could also be seen in @xmath7 if the @xmath8 is too light to decay to @xmath9 . as such , this method , and ours described below , are applicable to high - energy colliders such as the large hadron collider or next linear collider .",
    "susy theories also contain two scalar superpartners of the top quark , one for each @xmath10-quark helicity , called @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these two `` stops '' can mix , resulting in two mass eigenstates @xmath13 and @xmath14 whose masses can be very different . here",
    "we adopt the standard notation @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we examine the decay process @xmath16 .",
    "this comes about principally through the exchange of an intermediate @xmath17 boson or any of the higgs bosons .",
    "the measurement of cp violation in this process will therefore probe the cp phases in the stop couplings , as well as scalar - pseudoscalar mixing in the higgs sector .",
    "there are a variety of cp - violating asymmetries in this process , some of which depend on strong ( cp - conserving ) phases .",
    "however , since the @xmath1 s are leptons , they can not emit gluons , and the process @xmath18 does not have qcd - induced strong phases ( any gluons exchanged between the two stops only serve to renormalize the stop couplings ) . in order to generate strong phases",
    ", we therefore include the widths of the mediating particles .    in order to calculate the rate and the various cp - violating asymmetries for @xmath18",
    ", various susy parameters must be specified : the masses and couplings of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the masses , mixings and widths of the higgs bosons . however , these parameters are not all independent  they can be computed from the underlying susy parameters . to be specific , there are 7 fundamental susy parameters which strongly affect this decay process ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] for an explicit list ) .",
    "however , since the aim here is to measure cp violation , we are mainly interested in the underlying cp - violating susy parameters .",
    "we note that all cp - violating asymmetries in @xmath21 depend only on the stop couplings , the mixings of the higgses , and their widths .",
    "these quantities in turn depend on several cp - violating ( i.e. , complex ) parameters in the underlying theory  the various trilinear couplings , the gaugino masses and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , by specifying the phases of the various complex parameters , one can predict all cp - violating effects in @xmath21 ( recall that we have assumed that all cp - conserving quantities are known ) . we shall assume throughout that @xmath22",
    "is real and positive .",
    "this may be arranged by rephasing the various complex parameters  @xcite . with this phase convention ,",
    "the asymmetries in @xmath18 have a strong dependence on @xmath2 ( the phase of the trilinear coupling @xmath3 ) and only a much weaker dependence on the other phases .",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] for a more detailed discussion of this point . )",
    "thus , the measurement of cp - violating effects in @xmath23 will allow us to measure / constrain @xmath2 .    a computer program ",
    "`` cpsuperh ''  has been written by others to generate the physical susy parameters ( including the masses , mixings and widths of the higgs bosons , the masses of the stops and the couplings of the higgs bosons to the ( s)fermions ) from the underlying susy parameters  @xcite .",
    "thus , with this program in hand , it is necessary only to specify the values of the fundamental susy parameters .",
    "we use cpsuperh extensively in our numerical work below and have adopted their notation for the coupling constants .    in sec .",

    "the various cp - violating signals are examined in sec .",
    "[ sec : asymmetries ] .",
    "we show that there are two cp asymmetries which can be large in some regions of susy parameter space .",
    "these involve the measurement of one or both of the @xmath1 spins . in sec .",

    ". the measurement of these asymmetries will provide information about the susy cp phases .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendix contains additional information about the various cp asymmetries .",
    "we now present the details of the @xmath21 calculation .",
    "there are box - diagram contributions to this process , but they are expected to be small . thus , this decay is mediated principally by the @xmath17 boson and by any of the three neutral higgs bosons .",
    "that is , we have @xmath25 followed by @xmath26 . in the following",
    "we always take the @xmath27-@xmath28 invariant mass to be above the @xmath17 pole , and so we assume that only neutral higgs - exchange diagrams are important . while interferences between the higgs diagrams and the off - shell @xmath17 could in principle give contributions to the cp asymmetries we consider , these contributions are expected to be small , unless the lightest higgs boson has a mass very close to that of the @xmath17 . to simplify our discussion",
    ", we ignore any contributions from the @xmath17 .. if @xmath17 contributions end up being required , they could be incorporated in a straightforward manner . ]    as mentioned in the introduction , the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs particles in susy can mix if cp is violated , leading to three physical neutral higgs bosons that do not have well - defined cp transformation properties . in general , the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing need not be small . the squarks also mix , and in general the up - type squark mass - squared matrix is @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is usually assumed that the up - type squarks are block - diagonalized by the same unitary transformations that diagonalize the up - type quarks . in this case , one obtains a simplified form for the mixing matrix : one only needs to diagonalize a set of @xmath30 matrices .",
    "we adopt this simplifying assumption for the stops and consider only the mixing between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the cpsuperh program calculates the masses and mixings of both the stops and the higgs bosons .",
    "the couplings between the stops and higgs bosons may be described by the following lagrangian : _ h = v _ i , j , k g_h_i_j^*_k h_i",
    "_ j^ * _ k  , where @xmath33 is related to the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath34 , and where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "expressions for the matrices @xmath40 may be found in appendix b of ref .  @xcite . in the cp - invariant limit ,",
    "the couplings involving scalar higgs bosons are real and those involving the pseudoscalar higgs are purely imaginary",
    ". if cp is broken , these couplings are in general complex .",
    "we also require the couplings between the tau leptons and the various higgs bosons .",
    "the relevant piece of the lagrangian is @xmath44 where @xmath35 .",
    "the constant @xmath45 and the scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , are real . at tree - level",

    "that cp is conserved , a given higgs boson @xmath48 has either a scalar or a pseudoscalar coupling , but not both .",
    "the final ingredient in our calculation is the higgs - boson propagator . in the decay @xmath18",
    ", we allow one or more of the higgs bosons to go on - shell .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold .",
    "first , this will dramatically increase the rate , giving a possibility that experimentalists will in fact be able to measure the asymmetries that we construct .",
    "second , as noted above , the strong phases in this process are obtained mathematically by including the widths , i.e.  absorptive pieces in the propagator .",
    "these absorptive parts have a much larger effect near resonance .",
    "there is one complication here .",
    "it is true that cpsuperh computes all the physical properties of the higgs bosons .",
    "in particular , the width of the @xmath48 boson is found by calculating the 1-loop contributions of the light particles ( taken here to be principally @xmath49 and @xmath1 ) , and applying cutkowsky rules .",
    "however , in our calculation the `` off - diagonal widths '' come into play .",
    "that is , this 1-loop diagram can also be used to relate a @xmath48 boson to a @xmath50 boson , and the absorptive parts of such diagrams can be important for those cp asymmetries in our decay process which rely on strong phases .",

    "fig : cl_res ] and calculate the appropriate ratios .",
    "a comparison of the area under the dashed curve ( @xmath181 ) to that under the solid curve ( @xmath169 ) indicates that the cp asymmetry will be relatively large in this case .",

    "it turns out that the difference in the strengths of these resonances is due primarily to differences in the higgs - stop - stop couplings . 2 .",
    "in this example the two heaviest higgs resonances have a relatively significant overlap , allowing for some amount of interference between the resonances .",

    "the increase in the single - spin asymmetry is not difficult to understand : the numerator in eq .",

    "in such a scenario it might be experimentally preferable when measuring the triple - product asymmetry to restrict the integration over @xmath103 to smaller regions or to weight the region near the middle resonance with a relative negative sign ( to avoid the cancellation ) .",
