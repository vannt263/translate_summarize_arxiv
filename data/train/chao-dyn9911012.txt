    "traditionally , ocean forecasting is carried out integrating forward in time the equations of motion .",
    "this approach usually requires the derivation of the dynamical laws controlling the ocean processes as well as the detailed knowledge of the initial conditions .",
    "unfortunately , this level of knowledge or the computer power needed for the numerical simulation of the ocean is not always accessible . in these cases , an alternative approach to forecast ocean evolution",
    "consists in extracting dynamical information directly from the empirical data without imposing an explicit dynamical model .",
    "the extracted information about the past of the system is then used to predict its future evolution .",
    "the classical techniques in this type of approach consist on modeling the dynamics as a random process , using nondeterministic and linear laws of motion @xcite .",
    "however , new techniques that explicitly take into account the nonlinear nature of the time evolution are demonstrating a high predictive power .",
    "proposals based on genetic algorithms are beginning to appear in different contexts @xcite",
    ". briefly stated , genetic algorithms are methods to solve optimization problems in which the optimal solution is searched through steps inspired in the darwinian processes of natural selection and survival of the fittest @xcite . in the forecasting context ,",
    "the optimization problem to be solved is to find the empirical model best describing observed past data . the empirical model so obtained",
    "may then be used to forecast the future , and may reveal functional relationships underlying the data .",
    "recently , @xcite has already shown the robustness of genetic algorithms to forecast the behavior of one - variable chaotic dynamical systems .",
    "the aim of our letter is to extend the work of @xcite to spatially extended dynamical systems , thus permitting application to real oceanographic data .",
    "more explicitly , we focus on using genetic - algorithm methods to predict the space - time variability of the sea surface temperature ( sst ) of the alboran sea . the reasons for this particular election arise from the circulation structure of this basin , the westernmost of the mediterranean sea , characterized by a wavelike front with two anticyclonic gyres generated by the inflow of atlantic waters into the mediterranean throught the strait of gibraltar @xcite .",
    "this circulation pattern has a strong signature in the sst field , which provides the chance to observe its space - time variability from satellite imagery .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : section ii presents the technique ; section iii briefly describes the characteristics of the satellite data employed in this study .",
    "the results obtained from the application of the method are shown in section iv , and section v concludes the work .",
    "the methods of @xcite are adequate to forecast the time evolution of one or a small set of variables .",
    "two - dimensional sst fields obtained by satellite imagery are too large data sets for this technique to work directly .",
    "a method to encode the time series of satellite images into a smaller set of numbers is thus required .",
    "this can be accomplished by using the empirical orthogonal function ( eof ) technique @xcite .",
    "briefly , eof analysis decomposes the space - time distributed satellite data into modes ranked by their temporal variance . as a result , a set of spatial modes and",
    "associated temporal amplitude functions are obtained .",
    "the spatial modes provide information of the spatial structures while the amplitude functions describe their dynamics .",
    "the complete state of the system ( i.e. , the original sequence of satellite images ) can be well approximated by simple linear combination of the most relevant spatial modes multiplied by their corresponding amplitude functions @xcite .",
    "the problem of forecasting the dynamics of a two - dimensional field has thus been reduced to predicting the amplitude functions , a small set of time - series , corresponding to the most relevant eofs .",
    "the works of @xcite , @xcite , and many others have established the methodology for nonlinear modeling of chaotic time series . explicitly , takens theorem @xcite establishes that given a deterministic time series @xmath0 there exists a smooth map @xmath1 satisfying :    @xmath2\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is called the embedding dimension obtained from a state - space reconstruction of the time series @xcite .",
    "our aim is to obtain with a genetic algorithm the functions @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ uno ] ) that best represents the amplitude function associated to each one of the most representative eofs , and then use them to predict the future state of the system .",
    "the algorithm proceeds as follows ( for details see @xcite ) : first , for the @xmath5-amplitude function , @xmath6 , a set of candidate equations ( the population ) for @xmath4 is randomly generated .",
    "these equations ( individuals ) are of the form of eq .",
    "( [ uno ] ) and their right hand sides are stored in the computer as sets of character strings that contain random sequences of the variable at previous times ( @xmath7 ) , the four basic arithmetic symbols ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) , and real - number constants . a criterion that measures",
    "how well the equation strings perform on a training set of the data is its fitness to the data , defined as the sum of the squared differences between data and forecast from the equation string . the strongest individuals ( equation strings with best fits )",
    "are then selected to exchange parts of the character strings between them ( reproduction and crossover ) while the individuals less fitted to the data are discarded .",
    "finally , a small percentage of the equation strings most basic elements , single operators and variables , are mutated at random .",
    "the process is repeated a large number of times to improve the fitness of the evolving population .",
    "more details of the algorithm are given in the appendix .    in order to minimize the effects of the stochastic components introduced into the amplitude functions by the measurement and environmental noise , and by neglecting the eofs of small variance in the reconstruction processes , a noise - reduction method based on singular spectral analysis ( ssa ) or data adaptive approach @xcite , to be described below ,",
    "is first applied to the noisest amplitude functions .",
    "in the present study we have considered a series of 68 monthly averaged sst images of the alboran sea , ranging from march-1993 to october-1998 .",
    "each monthly image is based on the daily maximum images using the average for every single pixel s position .",
    "the monthly composition normally consits of approximately 160 avhrr passes .",
    "several tests ensure that sst values are derived only for cloudfree water surfaces .",
    "all pixels flagged as cloud are excluded from all further processing .",
    "the data set is an avhrr mcsst product from dlr .",
    "figure  1a , b , c and d show the mean , 1st , 2nd and 3rd spatial modes respectively obtained from the eof analysis , while the solid lines in figure 2 represent the temporal amplitude functions associated with each spatial mode .",
    "basically , the 1st eof mode captures the variability associated with the seasonal changes in the surface temperature of atlantic and mediterranean waters .",
    "the 2nd spatial mode appears to be associated with variability in the intensity of the two gyres .",
    "finally , the 3rd mode essentially describes the spatial variability related to the almeria - oran front .",
    "these three modes account for @xmath12 of the total variance of the data .",
    "a complex eof decomposition of satellite altimetry data in the same area was performed by @xcite .",
    "the amplitude functions of the 2nd and 3rd eofs show a time dependence much more complex than the simple seasonal variation displayed by the 1st one .",
    "this could be an indication either of complex deterministic evolution or of contamination from random noise . to disentangle both components ,",
    "the signals were filtered using the ssa method : the filtered time series obtained from the amplitude functions of the 2nd and 3rd eofs ( red dashed lines in figs .",
    "2b and c ) were built considering the first eight and five ssa eigenvalues ( that account for @xmath13 and @xmath14 of each amplitude variance ) in the respective original time series .",
    "the criterion to identify this amount of deterministic variability in each signal was based on a nonlinear prediction approach @xcite .",
    "essentially , the signal to be filtered is rebuilt using only a certain number of eigenvalues obtained from the ssa decomposition .",
    "then , the genetic algorithm is employed to find the equation that best fits the data in one part of the dataset , the training set , ranging from march-1993 to june-1998 .",
    "the predictability skill of the solution equation is then validated with data ranging from july-1998 to october-1998 , the validation set , previously unknown for the algorithm .",
    "if the forecast performance of the solution equation is high in the validation set ( more than @xmath15 of agreement between data and forecast ) the rebuilt signal is considered to be mainly deterministic .",
    "a new time series is then rebuilt from the original one considering a larger number of eigenvalues and the previous process is repeated .",
    "the procedure is stopped when the inclusion of new eigenvalues deteriorates the forecasting skills , since then it can be argued that the variability represented by the new eigenvalues has a strong noisy component .",
    "the final filtered signal is thus rebuilt with the maximum number of eigenvalues that provide a good forecast skill in the validation set .",
    "the resulting empirical equations obtained from the iteration of the genetic algorithm for the three temporal amplitude functions are written in the appendix .",
    "figures  2a , b and c show the results of applying the solution equations .",
    "the blue dash - dotted line shows the results of applying the solution equation in the training set : all the points in the line are one - month - ahead predictions , i.e. they are obtained from the equations in the appendix and the observed values of the ( filtered ) temporal amplitude at @xmath3 previous months .",
    "blue circles are the one - month - ahead predicted values in the validation set , i.e. , the time interval for which measurements were used in the filtering process but not in the final genetic forecasting .    in order to discriminate if the excellent agreement between data and predictions in the validation set comes from artificial dependencies in the data introduced by the filtering procedure or from an intrinsic dynamical behavior well captured by the evolutionary algorithm , the solution equations are tested in a 3rd set of data called the forecasting set ( from november-1998 to january-1999 ) that has not been used in the filtering process .",
    "the crosses are one - month - ahead forecasts in this set of data .",
    "the agreement in all cases is excellent , thus indicating that the genetic algorithm has been able to capture the main time variability of each eof .",
    "it is remarkable that this has been achieved without the use of any explicit knowledge of the ocean dynamics , and using data just from the upper layer of the sea .",
    "it remains , to close the procedure , to obtain the total forecasted sst spatial field .",
    "this is accomplished by adding the three eofs multiplied by their predicted amplitudes .",
    "this has been carried out for the forecasting set .",
    "figures  3a and b show the monthly averaged sst field for november-1998 and the corresponding one - month - ahead forecast .",
    "the result correctly reproduces the main sst structure of the gyres in particular and the alboran sea in general .",
    "the technique slightly overestimates the sst of the two gyres .",
    "since the agreement with the filtered time - series was rather good , this discrepancy should correspond to the part of the observation that has been identified as stochastic by the algorithm .",
    "the results obtained for december-1998 are shown in figures  3c and d. in this case , the forecasted field still keeps a slight signature of the two gyres , a feature that is not found in the real data , although the presence of warm atlantic waters in the gyre areas is well reproduced .",
    "finally , figures  3e and f describe the results obtained for january-1999 .",
    "the real as well as the forecasted fields show a general cooling of the basin with the disappearance of the alboran gyres .",
    "we have proposed a new technique that allows prediction of ocean features using satellite imagery .",
    "we first compute the dominant spatial eof modes from a time series of satellite data , and next we forecast their time evolution using genetic algorithms .",
    "the technique has been applied to the one - month - ahead prediction of the sst field of the alboran sea , and has demonstrated a good performance .",
    "we expect the method to perform well in any other situations in which ocean structures are sufficiently permanent for the eof method to provide large data compression , and in which the dominant eofs contain a strong deterministic - evolution component as compared to the stochastic one .",
    "the method can be applied to any field observable from satellite ( sst , dynamic height , surface ocean colour ) , and the information obtained could be useful for operational needs such as fisheries , naval operations and even for assimilation into numerical models .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath3 are @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the 1st , 2nd and 3rd eof respectively and the maximum number of symbols allowed for each tentative equation is 20 .",
    "each generation consists of a population of 120 randomly generated equations .",
    "after @xmath18 generations we obtain for the 1st , 2nd and 3rd amplitude functions the following expressions :                                  vzquez - cuervo , j. , j. font , and j. j. martinez - benjamin , observations on the circulation in the alboran sea using ers1 altimetry and sea surface temperature data , _ j. phys .",
