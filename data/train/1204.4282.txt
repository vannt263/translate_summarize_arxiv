    "free and projective objects have not played anywhere near as important a rle in analysis as in algebra , nevertheless there has been some work done on these objects , mainly with the results that one would expect . for example , the existence of free and projective banach spaces is virtually folklore but is uninteresting as both are of the form @xmath9 for an arbitrary index set @xmath10 .",
    "the existence of free vector lattices over an arbitrary number of generators is also long established and holds no real surprises , see @xcite or @xcite for details . in this note",
    "we investigate free and projective banach lattices .",
    "some of our results are rather surprising and although we are able to answer many questions we are forced to leave several unanswered .",
    "it is almost obvious that , if it exists , then the free banach lattice over @xmath11 generators must be the completion of the free vector lattice over @xmath11 generators for some lattice norm . that the required norm actually exists is easily proved , but describing it in concrete and readily identifiable terms is not so easy",
    "indeed , except in the case @xmath12 , it is not a classical banach lattice norm at all .",
    "in fact it is only in the case that @xmath11 is finite that the free banach lattice over @xmath11 generators is even isomorphic to an am - space .",
    " 2 is primarily devoted to establishing notation whilst  3 recapitulates the existing theory of free vector lattices .",
    "we then prove the existence of free banach lattices in  4 and give a representation on a compact hausdorff space in  5 .",
    "we establish some of the basic properties of free banach lattices in  6 .",
    "the finitely generated free banach lattices are by far the easiest ones to understand , and we investigate their structure in  7 . in  8 we give some characterizations of free banach lattices over , respectively , one , a finite number or a countable number of generators , amongst all free banach lattices .",
    "preparatory to looking at projective banach lattices , in  9 we investigate when disjoint families in quotient banach lattices @xmath13 can be lifted to disjoint families in @xmath1 , giving a positive result for countable families and a negative result for larger ones .",
    "we prove the connection between free and projective banach lattices in  10 and in  11 find some classes of banach lattices that are , or are not , projective . finally , ",
    "12 contains some open problems .",
    "let us emphasize at this point that this paper is set in the category of banach lattices and linear lattice homomorphisms .",

    "this is a homogenous measure space and each order interval in @xmath18 has the property that the least cardinality of a dense subset is precisely @xmath11 , see @xcite  26 for details . in particular",

    "can the construction of a free banach lattice be generalized to give a free banach lattice over a metric space ? here",
    "a metric space @xmath142 embeds in a `` free '' banach lattice in some sense and any isometry of the generators into a banach lattice extends to a lattice homomorphism with some restriction on the norm .",
    "see @xcite for the banach space case .    we have seen in corollary [ ellinftyindual ] that @xmath574 contains a disjoint family of cardinality @xmath11 which contrasts strongly with the fact that disjoint families in @xmath209 itself can only be at most countably infinite .      at present",
    "we have no feel at all for what kinds of banach lattice are likely to be projective .",
    "clearly , there are a lot of `` small '' ones , where small means either separable or having a topological order unit .",
    "a major and obvious question to pose is :                  it is not difficult to lift a lattice homomorphism @xmath1068 to a lattice homomorphism @xmath1069 by lifting the images of the topological order units first .",
    "the problem seems to be the norm condition on @xmath1070 .",
    "it is clear that the fremlin tensor product , see @xcite , of two projective banach lattices need not be projective in general .",
    "example [ freemaxproj ] shows that this can not be true for the product of @xmath1004 and @xmath211 when @xmath11 is uncountable .",
    "there seems no good structural reason to expect a positive result to the next question , but a counterexample has eluded us so far .",
    "the building blocks that we can use in theorem [ ellonesum ] to build new projectives include finite dimensional spaces , @xmath211 for @xmath11 either finite or countably infinite and certain @xmath607-spaces .",
    "any of these , and the space that is produced by that theorem , will be separable and hence will have a topological order unit . some ( possibly rather rash ) conjectures that we might make are :                  the whole of this paper has been written in an isometric setting .",
    "all of our results may be reproved in an isomorphic setting , where we replace an ( almost ) isometric condition on operators with mere norm boundedness .",
    "it is not difficult to see that there will automatically be uniform bounds to the norms of operators and that isometrically free ( resp .",
    "projective ) banach lattices will be isomorphically free ( resp .",
    "projective ) .",
    "isomorphically free banach lattices will certainly be isomorphic to isometrically free banach lattices . at present",
    "it does not seem worth recording such a theory , unless there is negative answer to the following question ."
