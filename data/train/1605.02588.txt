    "vertex - distinguishing edge colorings of graphs is a wide studied field in chromatic graph theory . generally speaking ,",
    "it consists in an edge coloring of a graph ( not necessarily proper ) that leads to a vertex labeling where every pair of vertices of the graph are distinguished by their labels ( also called _ codes _ ) .",
    "for instance , a _ set irregular edge coloring _",
    "@xcite is an edge coloring of a graph where each vertex @xmath1 is assigned the set of colors of the edges incident to @xmath1 . in the literature , many other variants were considered where the codes are defined by the multisets of the colors incident to @xmath1  @xcite , the sums  @xcite , the products , or differences  @xcite .",
    "the case where the edge coloring is proper was also considered by burris and schelp  @xcite .",
    "more recently , several other variants of this problem were defined , in which the codes are produced from a vertex coloring . in the literature , they are refereed to as _ identifying colorings_. more precisely , from a vertex coloring of a graph , the code of a vertex is defined as the set of colors of its extended neighborhood",
    ". instances of the identifying coloring problem where any pair of distinct ( resp .",
    "adjacent ) vertices must have different codes were introduced in  @xcite ( resp .",
    "@xcite ) . if few results are known about this problem , its interest is growing as it is a natural generalization of the famous identifying code problem  @xcite .    in the current paper ,",
    "our objective is to generalize both set irregular and identifying coloring problems . for that purpose",
    ", we define a new vertex - distinguishing edge coloring problem where every edges is assigned a subset of colors . given a simple graph @xmath2 , a @xmath3-_coloring _ of @xmath2 is a function @xmath4 where every edge is labeled using a non - empty subset of @xmath5 . for any @xmath3-coloring @xmath6 of @xmath2 , we define , for every vertex @xmath7 , the set @xmath8 as follows : @xmath9 if the context is clear , we will simply write @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "a @xmath3-coloring @xmath6 is _ union vertex - distinguishing _ if , for all distinct @xmath12 in @xmath13 , @xmath14 . for a given graph @xmath2 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the smallest integer @xmath3 such that there exists a union vertex - distinguishing coloring of @xmath2 . figure  [ fig : intro ] illustrates such a coloring , where small labels correspond to the @xmath6 function , and the biggest ones denote the codes .",
    "example of a union vertex - distinguishing coloring ]    in most of the existing variants , only one color is allocated to each edge or vertex .",
    "note however that this idea of a coloring function that maps to subsets of integers was also considered by hegde in 2009 . in  @xcite ,",
    "hedge defined an edge - distinguishing vertex coloring where vertices are colored with sets of positive integers .",
    "the codes are defined on edges and equal the symmetric difference of the sets of the vertices incident to them .    as already mentioned , the union vertex - distinguishing problem generalizes existing problems related to vertex - distinguishing colorings .",
    "for instance , the set irregular edge coloring problem can be seen as an instance of the union vertex - distinguishing problem where only singletons are allowed on the edges .",
    "moreover , any identifying coloring @xmath6 of a graph @xmath2 induces a valid union vertex - distinguishing coloring .",
    "indeed , it suffices to color each edge of @xmath2 with the set of its incident colors in @xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ fig : intro2 ] illustrates this transformation . as a consequence , each edge of @xmath2 is colored with a set of size at most @xmath16 .    ]",
    "thus if @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) denotes the minimum number of colors of a set irregular ( resp . identifying ) edge coloring of a graph @xmath2 , the following inequality holds : @xmath19    if a graph @xmath2 has a connected component isomorphic to @xmath20 or at least two single vertices , there is no union vertex - distinguishing coloring of @xmath2 . hence we restrict ourselves in this paper to graphs with connected components of size at least @xmath0 . as for the identifying coloring problem  @xcite ,",
    "a lower bound is straightforwardly available for @xmath15 :    [ prop : lowerbound ] every graph @xmath21 where no connected component is isomorphic to a single vertex or an edge admits a union vertex - distinguishing coloring and satisfies @xmath22    since @xmath2 admits no connected component isomorphic to a single vertex or an edge , there always exists a union vertex - distinguishing coloring of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , for every pair of vertices @xmath23 , the sets of edges incident to @xmath24 and @xmath25 are distinct .",
    "thus if , one assign different colors to each edge , all the pairs of vertices are incident to distinct subsets of colors .",
    "in addition , since @xmath26 admits @xmath27 non empty subsets , a union vertex - distinguishing @xmath3-coloring must satisfy @xmath28 . indeed ,",
    "otherwise two vertices must receive identical non empty subsets of colors .",
    "a graph @xmath2 is _ optimally colored _",
    "if @xmath29 . we will show that every graph can be colored using @xmath30 or @xmath31 or @xmath32 colors .",
    "this result is somehow surprising since in almost all the known variants of identifying coloring , there exist graphs for which the gap between the lower bound and the minimum number of colors needed to identify all the vertices is arbitrarily large ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we can easily prove that there exist classes of graphs on which the optimal value can be obtained in any case ( e.g. trees , paths , large enough cycles , complete binary trees ... ) . in the case of complete graphs ,",
    "the lower bound provided by proposition  [ prop : lowerbound ] is not always tight . indeed , consider the complete graph @xmath33 of order @xmath34 for any integer @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath36 , then there exist two distinct vertices @xmath7 and @xmath1 such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the only way to produce these codes is to color all the edges incident to @xmath7 with the singleton @xmath39 , and all the edges incident to @xmath1 with @xmath40 . hence the edge",
    "@xmath41 would receive two different colors , a contradiction .",
    "harary proved in  @xcite that @xmath42 . putting together this result with ( [ eq : comp ] )",
    ", it ensures that we have @xmath43 .",
    "we were not able to find any graph for which @xmath32 colors are needed .",
    "determining if there exist , or not , graphs that can reach this last value is an interesting question .",
    "vizing theorem ensures that the minimum number of colors of a coloring of any graph of maximum degree @xmath44 is either @xmath44 ( which is the immediate lower bound ) or @xmath45 .",
    "our result is similar since all the union vertex - distinguishing number is either the optimal value or the optimal value plus one or the optimal value plus two .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : general ] , we prove our main result that ensures that for every graph @xmath2 that admits a union vertex - distinguishing coloring , the value of @xmath15 is between @xmath30 and @xmath32 . in section  [ sec : particularclasses ] , we prove that the lower bound is reached for paths , complete binary trees , and cycles of length @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
