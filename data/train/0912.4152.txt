    "we finally remark that whenever we speak about contributions of some order to an observable this has to be understood as an expansion @xmath37 and constructed by comparison to coefficients of @xmath38 .",
    "we now come to the main point of how to perform a gauge - fixed nspt computation , in the case at hand in landau gauge . a key issue of the standard ( in other words , non - perturbative )",
    "langevin equation for lgt is the non - necessity of fixing a gauge . in short : the drift term in langevin equation is equal to the lattice equations of motion ( put equal zero there ) . as a consequence ,",
    "longitudinal degrees of freedom undergo an unbounded diffusion , but the group manifold is compact and hence no divergence shows up .",
    "such a situation is no longer true in nspt .",
    "this is quite obvious in the algebra : the diffusion of the longitudinal component of the @xmath39 fields is unbounded and hence their norms diverge in stochastic time .",
    "we stress that gauge - invariant quantities are in principle not affected by these divergences , but this is no advantage : since norms are diverging one runs eventually into trouble by lack of accuracy .",
    "we also remark that this is true regardless of the choice of either expansion ( [ eq : expansion_of_a ] ) or ( [ eq : expansion_of_u ] ) : perturbation theory implies decompactification in any case .",
    "a solution comes along the lines suggested in  @xcite : _ fixing _ ( to some precision ) _ the gauge is going to fix the problem _ and this goes under the name of stochastic gauge fixing .",
    "we adhere here to the recipe of  @xcite .",
    "the langevin evolution steps are interwoven with gauge transformations @xmath40 the main requirement for @xmath41 is quite obvious : gauge transformations should be expanded in the coupling as well and the leading order should not affect the background vacuum around which the solution to langevin equation is expanded ( the trivial vacuum , in the case at hand ) . a convenient solution comes with the choice @xmath42    in general the action of the left / right lattice derivative @xmath43 on a function @xmath44 defined on site @xmath4 is given by @xmath45 the action of the left lattice derivative on the vector potential defined on midpoints of the links is defined as @xmath46 the resulting divergence is mapped to site @xmath4 .",
    "we will come back to this choice : the iteration of this gauge transformation would drive the field configuration to the landau gauge .    with respect to stochastic gauge fixing",
    ", it suffices here to point out that one step of ( [ eq : gtrafo ] ) using ( [ eq : localstep ] ) interwoven with the langevin step ( [ eq : iteration ] ) is enough to keep fluctuations under control provided that @xmath47 is chosen of order @xmath48 .",
    "the rationale for this is the essence of stochastic gauge fixing : any new drift term in the langevin equation which amounts to a local gauge transformation does not affect the asymptotic distribution of gauge invariant quantities , while it can provide a restoring force in the non - gauge - invariant sector .",
    "the differential ( finite difference , actually ) operator present in ( [ eq : localstep ] ) makes it clear that zero modes are completely unaffected up to this point .",
    "their divergences are still present .",
    "we take the simplest prescription of subtracting zero modes at every order .",
    "one can actually do more than this and perform a gauge - fixed nspt computation in the case of covariant gauges .",
    "the interested reader is referred to  @xcite .",
    "the key issue is that one can rewrite the functional integral in the faddeev - popov formalism , which merely results in a different form of the gauge action ( an effective action , one would say ) . without entering into details , in this context",
    "it is worth making two points .",
    "first , there is no need for the introduction of ghost fields : one simply faces an extra contribution to the action in the form @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the faddeev - popov operator we will be concerned with in the following .",
    "second , for the landau gauge the procedure is of little help , since the other extra piece in the action is the gauge fixing action @xmath51 , with @xmath52 being the covariant gauge parameter , which is zero in this case .",
    "the failure of the general covariant gauge nspt procedure has anyway a counterpart : as a limit case @xmath53 of covariant gauges , the landau gauge @xmath54 is related to an extremum of the norm of the field , and there is a well - known iterative procedure to reach such an extremum .",
    "the basic step is ( [ eq : localstep ] ) , _ i.e. _ the gauge transformation that we also use for stochastic gauge fixing .",
    "the iteration stops when , for all orders @xmath55 , the summed - up quadratic violations of ( [ eq : landaucond ] ) vanish within double precision ( @xmath56 is the lattice volume ) , @xmath57 = 0 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : condition}\\ ] ] iterating ( [ eq : gtrafo ] ) with ( [ eq : localstep ] ) is actually not very efficient , since it suffers from critical slowing down due to the low modes , which becomes more and more severe as the lattice size increases .",
    "an effective solution to this problem is also well - known and goes through fourier acceleration as introduced in @xmath58  @xcite . in nspt",
    "one makes use of the expanded variant of the gauge transformation @xmath59(p)\\right ] \\right\\ }     \\label{eq : fourieracc}\\ ] ] in order to achieve the minimal landau gauge .",
    "@xmath60 denotes the fourier transformation from discrete @xmath4 to momentum @xmath61 space and @xmath62 its inverse .",
    "the gauge transformation ( [ eq : fourieracc ] ) applied locally is actually not local in the sense of ( [ eq : localstep ] ) .",
    "the driving force , the divergence of the gauge potential , is non - locally smeared with a low - pass filter that attenuates the higher fourier components of @xmath63 by a factor @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 is a non - zero eigenvalue of the free field lattice laplacian , and its maximal value on a periodic lattice in all directions is @xmath66 .",
    "while we notice that the volume - independent optimal parameter @xmath47 for the case of periodic boundary conditions in all directions is found for this perturbative landau gauge fixing to be @xmath67 , we also point out that fourier acceleration also works if one takes the plain lattice momenta ( which in the following we will reference as @xmath68 ) instead of @xmath69 .",
    "this is a good point to pin down some notations for lattice momenta . in the following",
