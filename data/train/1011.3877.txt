    "in 1790 , william herschel found `` a most singular phaenomenon ! a star of about the 8th magnitude , with a faint luminous atmosphere , of a circular form , and of about 3  in diameter . ''",
    "this object , now known to us as ngc  1514 , with its central star inseparable from a `` shining fluid '' , convinced him that not all the nebulae he studied could be resolved into clusters of stars as he had thought @xcite",
    ". thus began over 200 years of study of ngc  1514 , though it is still classified as the round or elliptical planetary nebula that herschel saw .",
    "in modern terms , ngc  1514 is a moderately high excitation planetary nebula ( pn ) in taurus ( @xmath0 = 04@xmath1 09@xmath2 16990 , @xmath3 = + 30 46 3344 , j2000 ) .",
    "the optically visible central source ( cspn ) of ngc  1514 is unusual in that its spectral type is too late ( a0 ) to produce the observed nebula . @xcite and @xcite developed the notion of a binary central source , and concluded that an @xmath4 a0iii giant and a sub - luminous , dwarf o star would reproduce the observed uv spectrum .",
    "by contrast , @xcite concluded through the use of higher spectral resolution spectrophotometry that the visible star is a horizontal branch a star .",
    "this star is slightly cooler and has a much lower absolute magnitude than an a0iii giant .",
    "he finds that the cspn is better represented by an @xmath5 a star of @xmath6  k , and an sdo star with a temperature of 100,000  k and @xmath7 .",
    "later , @xcite built on earlier iue observations by @xcite to show that the cspn could be represented by an early a star of @xmath8  k along with a @xmath9 60,000  k subdwarf ; he also found that the cspn s ultraviolet flux varied by more than a factor of two on timescales of a year to a decade .",
    "ngc  1514 itself is typically catalogued as a round or slightly elliptical nebula , with an amorphous appearance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite describes the nebula as having an inner shell ( or main body ) with a diameter of @xmath10 , and an outer , homogeneous , spherical layer of @xmath11 .",
    "he interprets condensations within the inner part of the nebula as a toroid with the axis of symmetry at a position angle of 35 .",
    "@xcite classify it as a double shell pn , 132 and 183  in diameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : guide ] illustrates the optical appearance and uses their nomenclature ( which we adopt ) to highlight the various features .",
    "image of ngc  1514 .",
    "( fits data kindly supplied by r. corradi.)[fig : guide ] ]    @xcite describe ngc  1514 as a `` lumpy nebula composed of numerous small bubbles '' based on their deep [ ] image .",
    "they interpret the bubbles at the edge of the inner shell to be sweeping up outer shell ( `` halo '' ) material which is providing pressure confinement .",
    "they confirm a somewhat filamentary structure in the outer shell that had been reported earlier by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , ngc  1514 does not have an observable halo of the type needed for the timescale correlation method for determining the distance that is the focus of their paper .",
    "perhaps the spatiokinematic study by @xcite is the most in - depth look at the formation and structure of ngc  1514 .",
    "they used an imaging fabry - prot spectrometer to produce velocity - resolved maps of the 5007   [ ] line . from modeling the double- and triple - component line profiles seen in these maps",
    ", they deduced that ngc  1514 is a generally ellipsoidal shell nebula , but that it also has two `` blobs '' or bubbles of material emanating from the center .",
    "the southeast bubble is slightly blue - shifted , and the northwest blob is red - shifted , thus defining a `` polar '' axis .",
    "the bubbles themselves are uncollimated in that there are large velocity dispersions across each of the bubbles ; this is in contrast to other highly collimated , bipolar flows seen in many other pne .",
    "finally , they model the overall velocity structure of the nebula and derive peak expansion velocity of 23  km  s@xmath12 near the center , falling off with radial distance as expected from projection effects along the line of sight .",
    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , @xcite ) is a nasa mid - class explorer mission that is surveying the entire sky at wavelengths of 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 ( w1 through w4 , respectively ) .",
    "the point source sensitivity ( defined as a 5@xmath13 detection with eight repeat exposures per source ) is currently estimated to be 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 , and 6  mjy in these passbands , respectively .",
    "wise surveys the sky in 47 wide strips with a significant overlap between each strip that yields the eight or more coverages ( depending on ecliptic latitude ) .",
    "ngc  1514 was thus observed twelve independent times on 2010 feb 18 - 19 ut for a total of 106 seconds of integration time in each of the four bands ; ngc  1514 was easily detected in all four bands .",
    "the data presented here were processed with the `` first - pass '' version of the wise pipeline that utilized preliminary reduction algorithms and calibrations derived from early survey data .",
    "the twelve individual fields have been corrected for detector artifacts , optical distortions , and latent images .",
    "they were then combined into `` ops coadds '' with pixel outlier rejection to suppress cosmic rays and transient noise events , and have been resampled from the native plate scales of 2.75 ( w1 , w2 , and w3 ) and 5.5 ( w4 ) arcsec pixel@xmath12 to the wise image atlas scale of 1.375 arcsec pixel@xmath12 .",
    "the photometry has been calibrated using wise measurements of blue ( stellar ) calibrators ; calibration using red ( ulirg ) calibrators currently differs by several percent , so that the absolute fluxes are currently uncertain by @xmath1410% .",
    "( see @xcite for further discussion . )",
    "no color corrections have been applied to the photometry reported here . for our purposes , the correction terms for stellar spectra and blackbody continua and for all sources in the w4 band",
    "are essentially zero . in w3",
    ", the corrections do not exceed 15% until objects are cooler than @xmath15 160 k. for w2 , the equivalent temperature is @xmath15 250 k , and for w1 , @xmath15 400 k.    the w4 data were also reprocessed using the deconvolution capabilities of awaic , a coaddition and deconvolution package developed for wise , but which can be used with generic astronomical data sets @xcite .",
    "the deconvolution algorithm `` hires '' is based on the maximum correlation method , which was developed to enhance the scientific return from the iras survey .",
    "w4 data covering a 24  arcminute field was passed through just three iterations of hires , enough so that the model image has an apparent spatial resolution equivalent to the native w3 resolution .",
    "the resulting image , denoted as w4@xmath16 , is used only in morphological discussions ; all flux measurements are based on the w4 ops coadd image .",
    "inspection of even the raw , unprocessed wise images immediately revealed an unexpected structure in ngc  1514 . a pair of bright axisymmetric rings that surround the visible nebula are plainly apparent ( coadded data are shown in figure  [ fig : wise]a )",
    "; in fact , they dominate the emission at w4 , giving the red appearance to the rings in the figure .",
    "such a structure is not suggested in any of the visible wavelength images available to us ; e.g.  the dposs data presented in figure  [ fig : wise ] , the h@xmath0 image in figure [ fig : guide ] , the published figures of @xcite , @xcite , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and private communication ) , or the deep , very narrow - band image by d.  goldman .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     at wavelengths shorter than 4.6 @xmath17 , the cspn has a higher flux than the whole of the nebula .",
    "but at wavelengths longer than 4.6 @xmath17 , the nebula s flux density rises dramatically .",
    "a 180 k blackbody curve has been drawn into the figure to guide the eye , but it is clear that multiple temperature components are required to completely fit the data . a more detailed thermal model is not warranted given the few data points , but it is the case that the bulk of the emission comes from material that is quite cool , @xmath18 200 k , and some perhaps as low as 30 k to account for the far - infrared fluxes .    ]",
    "there is a moderately bright , dusty background present in the region near ngc  1514 ; @xcite ( as implemented by the ned extinction calculator ) predict an @xmath19 of 2.252 magnitudes in this direction ( @xmath20  =  165.53 , @xmath21  =  -15.29 ) .",
    "it appears that the pn is superimposed on top of one of the brighter ridges of this background ; we estimate a 12  brightness of 0.34 mjy  sr@xmath12 at the pn above the darkest areas of the image .",
    "( the zero point is not yet calibrated , so we can not know the absolute brightness . ) a 3@xmath223  w3 field is shown in figure  [ fig : cirrus ] .",
    "the equivalent w4 field shows all the same structures visible at w3 , while a comparison field taken 45  farther off the galactic plane ( @xmath20  =  165.53 , @xmath21  =  -60.29 ) , where the predicted @xmath19 is only 0.076 , shows no such background structure .",
    "we are therefore confident that this background structure is real .",
    "the extended emission outside a 5 arcminute diameter circle around ngc 1514 is dominated by this striated background , and we see no obvious correlation between these structures and the nebula , either in position or symmetry .",
    "the pn is simply superimposed onto one of the denser portions of this region .",
    "this conclusion calls into question some of the results found by @xcite and @xcite where they reported structures with degree angular scales that were linked with ngc  1514 in the iras data at 12 .",
    "the emission @xcite  see in their figure  1c matches that of our figure  [ fig : cirrus ] , but the much poorer spatial resolution of iras has smeared the background variations into the ring - like structure those authors report .",
    "indeed , if we bin the wise data down to two arcminute pixels , the appearance is similar enough to suppose that there is a link .",
    "however , the factor - of-60 higher resolution wise data show that the background nebulosity is not correlated with the pn in any simple way .",
    "3 degree field in the vicinity of ngc  1514 shows the striated background visible in the w3 band .",
    "the ridge upon which the pn is projected has a brightness of about 0.34 mjy  sr@xmath12 above the darkest area of the region ( which may not be zero flux ) .",
    "the pn itself is at the center .",
    "the white circles mask areas with known image defects : detector latents and optical reflections , both caused by very bright stars .",
    "the equivalent w4 image , except for the factor - of - two lower spatial resolution , has all the same structures that are visible here.[fig : cirrus ] ]      the spitzer space telescope observed ngc  1514 only once as part of a wavelength calibration program for the irs instrument .",
    "accordingly , the exposures are very short , ranging from 15 seconds in the low - resolution data to 60 seconds in the high resolution data , so that the overall signal - to - noise ratio is small .",
    "in addition , the pointings between the four different spectrometer modules do not overlap , so that only on the central source do they all sample the same region .",
    "these data are publicly available and were accessed through the spitzer data archive .",
    "low resolution spectra were extracted for the central position by using the most central of the pointings while using the most off - center pointings to subtract the background spectrum .",
    "this spectrum is presented in figure  [ fig : spitzerlo ] .",
    "several facts are immediately apparent : 1 ) the short wavelength end of the irs spectrum is dominated by emission from the 9800 k photosphere ; 2 ) the long wavelength end is dominated by 100  k thermal emission from circumstellar material ; 3 ) forbidden atomic lines from the nebula are quite strong even in just the line of sight to the cspn ; and 4 ) there is a complete lack of the pah emission bands .",
    "although pah emission is usually dominant in nebulae , many pne are known to have no pah band emission and are instead dominated by h@xmath23 line emission ; ngc  1514 appears to be a member of this class . since the wise w3 band encompasses all the pah emission bands from 7.6 to 13.5  , the spitzer data suggests that all the structure seen in w3 arises from the same material that produces the optical nebula , along with thermal emission from dust that is distributed throughout .     and 15.56 [ ]",
    "will contribute to the w3 flux , but the 25.89 [ ] line will contribute little to the w4 flux since the response is falling off rapidly .",
    "no significant pah emission is seen.[fig : spitzerlo],scaledwidth=49.0% ]     line does the distribution vary from the profile ; it is concentrated in the central 1-arcminute - diameter region.[fig : spect],scaledwidth=49.0% ]     line does the distribution vary from the profile ; it is concentrated in the central 1-arcminute - diameter region.[fig : spect],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    only six emission lines are unambiguously detected at either spectral resolution : the 25.89   [ ] line is quite strong ; the 10.51   [ ] , 15.56   [ ] , and 36.01   [ ] lines are fainter , but still well detected ; and the 18.71   and 33.48   [ ] lines are very faint , but definitely present .",
    "the presence of these lines , in particular that of [ ] , indicates a high excitation nebula ( central source of order 100,000 k ) , though not as high as some because of the lack of the [ ] line at 24.32  .",
    "nine spatial positions along the pn s polar axis were sampled at high spectral resolution with the short - high module , and seven positions were obtained along the equatorial plane with the long - high module ( figure  [ fig : spect ] ) .",
    "we note that , with the exception of the [ ] line , all the lines vary in intensity as a function of position in the same manner as the broadband w3 flux ; the w3 intensity profile matches the envelope of the line peaks surprisingly well .",
    "this implies that at least the sulphur ( doubly and triply ionized ) and neon are well mixed with the dust throughout the inner shell .",
    "the oxygen , on the other hand , ( at least the triply ionized species ) is concentrated in the inner 30  radius of the nebula , and is almost entirely absent outside that .",
    "the outer two positions taken with long - high module ( 75 arcsec from center ) are the only two positions that would be dominated by flux from the rings . in both positions ,",
    "the lines strengths ( 25.89 , 33.48 , and 36.01 ) are much less than for the more central positions . given that the nearest wise band , w4 , shows that the rings are brighter than the inner shell at long wavelengths , this suggests that lines are responsible for little of the ring emission ; the rings must be almost entirely thermal emission .    because no pair of emission lines from the same species was observed at the same spatial position",
    ", we can only make crude estimates of line ratios .",
    "one of the better indicators of electron density is the [ ] 18.7/33.5  line ratio . if we make the assumption that the underlying nebular brightness is roughly constant 50  from the cspn , then the ratio is a very low 0.33 ( @xmath24 w  m@xmath25 vs. @xmath26 w  m@xmath25 ) . even if our uniformity assumption is off by more than a factor of two either direction ,",
    "the inferred electron density is still well under @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "this agrees with the estimate by @xcite who derived a value of 290 @xmath28 for the inner shell and 140 @xmath28 for the outer shell based on h@xmath29 line strengths .",
    "given that the central source of ngc  1514 is a binary system , the presence of these rings , while perhaps surprising in their form , is not entirely unexpected .",
    "binarity and bipolar structures in pne go hand - in - hand ( e.g.  the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the new infrared data , and particularly the discovery of the rings , allow us to refine our understanding of ngc  1514 .",
    "the distance to ngc  1514 is quite uncertain . from the hipparcos catalog of parallaxes",
    ", one can derive a distance of @xmath30 pc , while the statistical methods summarized by @xcite can yield distances up to 1300 pc .",
    "our wise results do not shed a great deal of new light on the distance , but we can use our more confident estimate of @xmath31 to help set plausible limits on the range of possibilities .    in deriving the distance modulus to the nebula , the absolute magnitude of the cspn has a larger uncertainty by far than the dereddened apparent visual magnitude . if the brighter component of the cspn is taken to be an a0iii giant as determined by @xcite with an absolute magnitude of @xmath32 @xcite , then the inferred distance is @xmath33  pc . if , instead , the cspn is a horizontal branch a star as found by @xcite with an absolute magnitude @xmath34 @xcite , then the distance is @xmath35  pc .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that distances @xmath36  pc such as those found by the h@xmath29-to - radio ratio @xcite or diameter - to - radio flux relationships @xcite are overestimates .",
    "the hipparcos distance ( at @xmath37 ) is broadly consistent with our lower luminosity estimate , thus we consider a distance of 200300  pc quite plausible .      for purposes of extracting geometric information ,",
    "the rings can be modeled as two parallel , unresolved rings ( figure [ fig : ringfit ] ) with a deprojected separation of 41 ( 0.05 pc , if we assume @xmath38  pc ) , the southeast of which is 173 in diameter while the northwest is 177 in diameter ( roughly 0.2 pc ) .",
    "the rings are tilted 59 from pole - on and rotated to a position angle of 131 .",
    "a formal least squares fit using a downhill simplex method was attempted , but the irregularities in the ring brightness and the complexity of the interior shell morphology prevented a believable solution from being found .",
    "the values quoted are estimated from `` by eye '' fits , but numerous trials showed noticeable errors in the diameter and separations at the @xmath39 level , in pa at @xmath40 , and in tilt at @xmath41 .",
    "higher spatial resolution imaging than can be provided by wise will be required to refine these estimates .",
    "image has been subtracted to remove the inner shell from the w3 image ( left panel ) ; this image was then rotated clockwise 131  so the polar axis is vertical .",
    "the ring model ( center ) was then subtracted to reveal the residuals ( right ) .",
    "while not a perfect fit due to the over - simplicity of the model , the general orientation and aspect ratios seem to be correct.[fig : ringfit ] ]    by subtracting the ring models from the integrated flux measurements , we estimate the percentage contribution of the rings to the total nebular flux .",
    "the rings contribute @xmath42  10% at w1 and w2 , @xmath15  15% at w3 , and @xmath9  30% at w4 .",
    "the increasing fraction is consistent with the redder color of the rings noted in section [ sec : redness ] and suggests a ring color temperature of @xmath43  k.    this ring model fit can then be overlayed on all the images in order to see how the various features visible at differing wavelengths compare ( figure [ fig : rings ] ) . starting with the middle row",
    ", the fit falls well on the rings seen at all four wise wavelengths ( w1 is very similar to w2 and has been omitted ) . at visible wavelengths ,",
    "the ring fit falls entirely within the faint outer shell , but no evidence can be seen for the rings themselves at these wavelengths . in the far - infrared , the nebula is not well resolved , but it appears that it is elongated roughly along the equatorial plane of the model , suggesting that there is an extensive , dusty disk lying in the plane .",
    "this disk can not be very dense given that the extinction to the central source is not large , and there are no color gradients across the nebula .    at 1.4 ghz in the nvss survey ,",
    "the nebula is resolved into two spots corresponding to the visible bubbles .",
    "@xcite report a total flux of 60  mjy at 30  ghz for ngc  1514 .",
    "they note that this pn shows no sign of a high - frequency excess such as that attributed to emission from spinning dust @xcite .",
    "the radio emission from ngc  1514 is therefore purely free - free ; this again suggests that the bubbles contain a significant quantity of ionized gas while the rings do not .",
    "@xcite present a physical model of ngc  1514 in their section 4 that agrees very well with our observations .",
    "the overall ellipsoidal shape of the pn is still apparent in the infrared .",
    "the presence of the rings confirms the axisymmetric structure they assume .",
    "we refine the estimate of the position angle of the polar axis from 135  to 131 , and we establish a tilt angle of 31  out of the plane of the sky , agreeing with them that the southeast part of the nebula is the side that opens toward us . while they could not determine the relative angles between the bubble axis and the shell axis , we can confirm that they are coincident ( see , for example , figure  [ fig : rings ] ) .",
    "this general configuration now seems quite secure .",
    "the formation of the rings themselves is still uncertain . at the simplest level ,",
    "the rings are part of the dust that is associated with the photon - dominated region ( pdr ) that is , in turn , wrapped around the ionized zone .",
    "but , lacking specific kinematic information on the rings ( recall that @xcite concentrated on the inner shell , and where their sample points might have contained the rings , the rings are not detected ) , we can only compare ngc  1514 to other objects that have similar morphologies .",
    "two such objects are hen  2 - 104 and mycn  18 , although in both of these cases the structures are seen at visible wavelengths .",
    "the core of hen  2 - 104 bears the most striking resemblance to ngc  1514 , though hen  2 - 104 itself is a symbiotic star rather than a pn and it shows multiple sets of rings .",
    "@xcite , and updates by @xcite , develop spatiokinematic models to explain the rings and accompanying structures .",
    "they invoke the model proposed by @xcite that uses interacting winds from the central binary source to explain the multiple rings and overall collimated structure .",
    "such a model could partially explain ngc  1514 if we assume that the rings we observe represent a particularly large mass loss event and are thus merely the brightest ones in the system , and that other rings and a more extensive structure may be detectable if greater sensitivity were available to us ( and it were not washed out by the dusty background emission ) .",
    "however , the focusing mechanism of the winds can not be so efficient as to prevent the formation of the relatively uniform outer shell seen at visible wavelengths .",
    "the formation of mycn  18 may follow similar lines .",
    "it has a very well defined hourglass shape with numerous pairs of parallel rings , though the overall structure is much more focused than either hen  2 - 104 or ngc  1514 .",
    "@xcite propose a mechanism related to that of @xcite , except that the rings are formed by a more collimated outflow jet interacting with a round circumstellar envelope .",
    "this could again fit ngc  1514 if we assume that there was one event that was far stronger than any other , and any other events are simply too faint for wise to detect .",
    "this still leaves the question of why the rings are visible only in the infrared .",
    "our interpretation is that , based in the spectral index of the ring emission discussed earlier , the rings are still present but are just too faint in comparison with the more uniformly distributed line emission in the outer shell .",
    "the rings are simply washed out at visible wavelengths .",
    "the discovery of axisymmetric rings in ngc  1514 completes our perception of it as a planetary nebula formed from an aging binary star system .",
    "no longer can ngc  1514 be considered a simple planetary nebula `` of a circular form '' as herschel perceived it . while the morphology is very complex , with numerous bubbles contained within the inner shell and rings contained within the outer shell , it joins the family of hourglass - shaped nebulae .    it is likely that more such unexpected structures will be found in pne as the wise survey data becomes widely available .",
    "as new hourglass objects are found , the formation models can be put to more rigorous tests , and we will gain a deeper understanding of how these mysterious and beautiful objects have come to exist .",
    "we thank our anonymous referee for the very thorough review of this manuscript and the suggestions which improved our discussion .",
    "we are grateful to romano corradi for his generous provision of the fits files for the and h@xmath0 images of ngc  1514 , and to roc cutri and frank masci for explanations of the wise processing pipeline .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a pair of infrared , axisymmetric rings in the planetary nebula ngc  1514 during the course of the wise all - sky mid - infrared survey . </S>",
    "<S> similar structures are seen at visible wavelengths in objects such as the `` engraved hourglass nebula '' ( mycn  18 ) and the `` southern crab nebula '' ( hen  2 - 104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in ngc  1514 we see only a single pair of rings and they are easily observed only in the mid - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> these rings are roughly 0.2 pc in diameter , are separated by 0.05 pc , and are dominated by dust emission with a characteristic temperature of 160 k. we compare the morphology and color of the rings to the other nebular structures seen at visible , far - infrared , and radio wavelengths , and close with a discussion of a physical model and formation scenario for ngc  1514 . </S>"
