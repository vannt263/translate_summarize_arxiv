    "if it is indeed a be system , the estimated orbital period @xmath113 can vary between @xmath20 and @xmath114 days .",
    "the observed duration of the source outburst allows us to put further constraints on the value of the binary period . assuming that we observed a single outburst from the source and that it corresponds to one orbital cycle , we obtain @xmath115 days .",
    "note , however , that if the source went through the giant ( class ii ) outburst lasting for several orbits ( stella , white & rosner 1986 ) or a sequence of shorter outbursts during august - october 2004 , the orbital period of the system could be much shorter than 60 days .",
    "another possibility is that cxou j073709.1 + 653544 is a transient low - mass binary system .",
    "the transient behavior and high luminosity of the source are somewhat similar to that of the galactic bursting x - ray pulsar gro j1744 - 28 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1996 ) , that reached a luminosity of @xmath116 ergs s@xmath4 during the peak of its outburst ( giles et al .",
    "1996 ; sazonov , sunyaev & lund 1997 ) . in the low - mass system scenario , the transient outbursts of the source could be explained by sudden increase of accretion from the disk reservoir ( sunyaev & shakura 1977 ) or as a result of the viscous - thermal instability of the quiescent accretion disk .",
    "the discovery of x - ray pulsations in cxou j073709.1 + 653544 is yet another demonstration that deep monitoring observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have a great potential in revealing populations of both persistent and transient pulsating x - ray sources in nearby galaxies .",
    "future observations of cxou j073709.1 + 653544 , if it reappears , could possibly give deeper insight into the behavior of this and other similar x - ray pulsar systems .",
    "the complete coverage of the source outbursts with more frequent sampling would allow to estimate the orbital parameters of the system and help to determine its nature .",

    "<S> the rate of decrease of the pulsation period of the source ( @xmath7 s s@xmath4 ) is one of the fastest observed among accreting pulsars . </S>",

    "<S> the x - ray luminosity of cxou j073709.1 + 653544 is high enough to account for the observed spin - up rate , assuming that the x - ray source is powered by disk accretion onto highly magnetized neutron star . </S>",
