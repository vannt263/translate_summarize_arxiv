    "a fascinating and relatively common problem in solid - state physics is the motion of electrons in a lattice structure where localized spins are present , possibly in an organised form .",
    "the scattering of the electrons by the spins represents a complex physics problem for the theoretical investigator , especially when ( like it seems to happen for the high-@xmath4 cuprate superconductors ) the spin and charge degrees of freedom are attached to the same particles  a situation which we do not consider . in a simplified picture",
    "we assume first of all that the spins are localised and interacting , but that the mobile electrons do not interact with each other ( or interact weakly and give rise to independent quasiparticles ) and are separate entities from the electrons that produce the magnetic ions . in this case",
    "the individual electrons ( or quasiparticles ) experience the localized spins as an effective local magnetic flux ( mller - hartmann and dagotto , 1996 ) .",
    "this flux produces a berry ( or peierls ) phase in the hopping terms of the electrons hamiltonian . in this paper",
    "we shall study a situation with a locally staggered flux , created by plaquettes of ordered spins , where the _ global _ flux is zero .",
    "this case is realized , for instance , in a kagome lattice ( ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa , 2000 ) , a two dimensional ( 2d ) lattice consisting of triangles and hexagons of the same interatomic distance and that can be viewed as a triangular bravais lattice with a three - point atomic basis forming an equilateral triangle of size half that of the triangular lattice parameter s . in fig.1 we remind the reader of the kagome lattice structure .",
    "this type of lattice may have experimental relevance in the planes of pyrochlore compounds ( ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa , 2000 , ramirez , 1994 , harris and zinkin , 1996 ) and the transport properties we describe may be appropriate for such materials .",
    "ferromagnetic pyrochlore crystals of the type r@xmath5mo@xmath5o@xmath6 ( r = nd , sm or gd ) have revealed interesting transport properties like an anomalous hall effect increasing as the temperature @xmath7 is lowered , ( taguchi and tokura , 1999 ) a feature that seems to be connected with the geometrical frustration of pyrochlore lattices that is partly embodied by the kagome lattice itself , viewed now as the ( 1,1,1 ) cross - section of the 3d pyrochlore s lattice .",
    "motivated by the transport properties of pyrochlore compounds , as well as by those of the manganite ones , we study in this paper some quantum transport properties of the kagome lattice with a canted localised spin texture in which independent electrons can move .",
    "the behavior of the berry phase as a function of the spin canting for the model at hand , and its consequences in terms of the macroscopic transport properties of the model are studied in this paper .",
    "we discuss in detail the energy spectrum as it depends strongly on the canting of the localized spins .",
    "in particular , the nodes in the spectrum and the opening of energy gaps are investigated , including their consequences for the transport properties .",
    "moreover , we evaluate explicitely the longitudinal conductivity @xmath3 and the hall conductivity @xmath2 as a function of the canting angle @xmath0 or flux @xmath1 .",
    "our results for the transport properties are then compared with those of another famous model of this class , where a staggered magnetic field is applied to electrons within a honeycomb lattice ( haldane , 1988 ) .",
    "the latter has very similar spectral properties as the model , first proposed by ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa , ( 2000 ) defined on the kagome lattice and studied here in greater detail . the model on the honeycomb lattice",
    "was proposed by haldane as the condensed - matter ( solid - state ) equivalent of the quantum hall effect , in that a quantization of the hall @xmath2 conductivity can be achieved by varying the local flux per plaquette @xmath1 , but without the need to introduce an external , homogeneous magnetic field . in the case of the kagome lattice model at hand , the same result will be shown to be attained through the introduction of a localised spin texture .",
    "our results confirm and complete the work by ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa for the hall @xmath2 conductivity , with explicit calculations in terms of expansions around the gap s nodes shown in detail , and moreover the quantized values of the longitudinal @xmath3 conductivity are obtained indicating the existence of some sort of metal - insulator transition as the canting angle moves away from some special values .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the tight - binding model of ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa for localized spins is described .",
    "the relationship between the localized spin s wavefunction and the berry phase of the hopping elctron is discussed in section 2.1 , and the application to the kagome lattice ( section 2.2 ) is presented . in section 2.3 the tigh - binding model for the honeycomb lattice with a staggered magnetic field",
    "is also presented and compared to the model on the kagome lattice .",
    "transport properties are then studied in section 3 by making explicit use of kubo s formula and an expansion of the energy spectrum near the nodes next to the fermi energy , and the results obtained are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we consider the electronic hopping between nearest neighbours on a kagome lattice as described by the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom are coupled to a set of localized spin-@xmath8 degrees of freedom on the same lattice via a local hund coupling @xmath9 . in this work @xmath10 , but generalization to the physically and theoretically interesting case of larger @xmath8 is possible . when @xmath9 is strong enough the spin of the hopping electron",
    "is forced to allign parallel to the localised spin @xmath11 at each site and through double - exchange mechanism ( zener , 1951 , anderson and hasegawa , 1955 , de gennes , 1960 ) the tight - binding hopping parameter @xmath12 between two neighbouring sites @xmath13 becomes proportional to the projection of the localised - spin wave function at site @xmath14 onto that at site @xmath15 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian representing the hopping is then @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the bare hopping parameter and @xmath19 the spin wave function for a spin-@xmath20 quantized along the direction defined by the unit vector @xmath21 .",
    "this spinor wave function clearly satisfies ( with @xmath22 the vector of pauli matrices ) @xmath23 and is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an undetermined overall gauge degree of freedom .",
    "the effective hopping parameter is then @xmath26 and since @xmath27 , with @xmath28 or @xmath29 being the angle between the two localized spins directions of quantization so that @xmath30 , we see that we can put @xmath31 where the berry phase @xmath32 is obtained ( ignoring the gauge parameters ) through @xmath33 and can be evaluated , e.g. , by means of @xmath34 to see what the phase @xmath32 is , geometrically , we introduce the unit vector @xmath35 and evaluate the triple product @xmath36 which shows that @xmath37 this expression is a special case of the formula giving the solid angle @xmath38 between three unit vectors @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 ( as can be verified by taking , e.g. , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; @xmath38 can also be seen as the area of the portion of unit sphere enclosed by the maximum circles passing through the unit vectors tips ) . in the last formula , of course , @xmath46 and therefore @xmath47 .",
    "we remark that this formula for three spins is completely analogous to that for the chirality gauge field in the formulation of lee and nagaosa ( 1992 ) for the chiral spin liquid theory of high - temperature superconductivity ( wen , wilczek and zee , 1989 ) . in this formulation the instantaneous gauge field flux through the triangular plaquette made up by the three spins",
    "is @xmath48 . back to our two - spins hopping problem",
    ", we then conclude that @xmath49 , or @xmath50 ( the factor @xmath20 being probably due to our specially chosen localised spin value , which leads to the conjecture that for a generic spin-@xmath8 situation the berry phase would be @xmath51 ) .",
    "since the solid angle @xmath52 is also the unit sphere s surface area between the tips of the three vectors @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath35 , the phase @xmath55 can also be seen as the flux of a magnetic monopole s field of modulus @xmath56 with the monopole placed in the sphere s center , or , alternatively , as the flux of the related gauge field @xmath57 through the triangle bearing on the segment @xmath58 of a triangular kagome lattice s unit cell ( ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa , 2000 ) . in this way , the berry phase @xmath32 acquires some physical meaning too .",
    "we now consider this tight - binding model on the kagome lattice with a fixed localised - spin configuration ( or spin texture ) as suggested by ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa ( 2000 ) , in which the unit vectors @xmath53 at each site of a triangular unit cell are tilted outwards at a fixed angle @xmath0 over the unit vector @xmath35 orthogonal to the lattice plane .",
    "this means ( labelling the spins clockwise a , b and c in the unit cell ) @xmath59 the flux generated by the spins in every triangular unit is set equal to @xmath1 with the condition @xmath60 with @xmath61 ( mod @xmath62 ) and thus @xmath63 this is equivalent to the expression proposed by ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa ( preprint of ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa ( 2000 ) ) @xmath64 . the graph for this expression of @xmath65 is shown in fig.2 for convenience .     as a function of the tilting angle @xmath0 of the localized spins.,width=415 ]    as pointed out by ohgushi , murakami and nagaosa ( 2000 ) , the flux per triangular unit cell @xmath1 is cancelled out for the chosen spin texture by the flux @xmath66 generated by each of the remaining hexagonal hopping plaquettes on the kagome lattice .",
    "there are indeed twice as many triangular units as hexagonal plaquettes , so that the overall gauge field flux through the lattice is zero .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the analogous tight - binding model in a staggered magnetic field as was proposed by haldane ( 1988 ) to mimick the quantized hall effect in a condensed - matter situation . in the present model ,",
    "the chosen spin - texture , with all localised spins tilted by the same angle @xmath0 in each unit cell , is presumably the one corresponding to the mean - field solution for some magnetic spin - spin heisenberg hamiltonian which should be added to our tight - binding hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ tbh ] ) , to give a total hamiltonian of the type @xmath67 the role of the spin fluctuations around this ordered spin texture , @xmath68 , as well as the effects of different spin textures , ( e.g. afm ones ) could serve as an interesting further research problem for future studies .      the kagome lattice is made up of triangular and hexagonal plaquettes and can be seen as a triangular lattice with a 3-point basis where every triangular unit cell contains three sites , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( fig 1 ) .",
    "the displacement vectors between these sites are @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with @xmath75 .",
    "the effective hopping parameter of ( [ tbh ] ) can be written as @xmath76 and since @xmath77 is fixed for the chosen spin texture , @xmath29 being the angle between the n.n .",
    "pair of localized spins , we can choose the convention where @xmath78 .",
    "then , in momentum space , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the ( suitably symmetrized ) matrix @xmath82 the three eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are @xmath83 with @xmath84\\ ] ] and @xmath85 the three bands touch in six points only for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , while for @xmath1 different from these values there is a gap between the bands , as shown in fig .",

    "the problem of calculating transport coefficients with this @xmath91 matrix is not exactly solvable , so we reduce this matrix to a @xmath92 one by expanding @xmath81 around the nodes .",
    "this can be done with a unitary transformation which allows us to neglect the terms related to the lower band ; in fact this band is far from the other two and gives no relevant contribution to the green function present in the kubo formula . to find this unitary transformation we consider the hamiltonian evaluated at a node @xmath93 .",

    "<S> the relationship between the canting angle of the spin texture @xmath0 and the berry phase field flux per triangular plaquette @xmath1 is derived explicitly and we emphasize the similarities between this model and haldane s honeycomb lattice version of the quantum hall effect ( haldane , 1988 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantization of the transverse ( hall ) conductivity @xmath2 is derived explicitly from the kubo formula and a direct calculation of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath3 shows the existence of a metal - insulator transition as a function of the canting angle @xmath0 ( or flux density @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this transition might be linked to that observable in the manganite compounds or in the pyrochlore ones , as the spin ordering changes from ferromagnetic to canted . </S>"
