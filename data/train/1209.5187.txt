    "the identification of a deterministic linear operator from the operator s response to a probing signal is an important problem in many fields of engineering .",
    "concrete examples include system identification in control theory and practice , the measurement of dispersive communication channels , and radar imaging .",
    "it is natural to ask under which conditions ( on the operator ) identification is possible , in principle , and how one would go about choosing the probing signal and extracting the operator from the corresponding output signal .",
    "this paper addresses these questions by considering the ( large ) class of linear operators that can be represented as a continuous weighted superposition of time - frequency shift operators , i.e. , the operator s response to the signal @xmath2 can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the spreading function associated with the operator . the representation theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "14.3.5 ) states that the action of a large class of continuous ( and hence bounded ) linear operators can be represented as in . in the communications literature operators with input - output relation as in are referred to as linear time - varying ( ltv ) channels / systems and @xmath4 is the delay - doppler spreading function @xcite .    for the special case of linear time - invariant ( lti ) systems , we have @xmath5 , so that reduces to the standard convolution relation @xmath6 the question of identifiability of lti systems is readily answered by noting that the system s response to the dirac delta function is given by the impulse response @xmath7 , which by fully characterizes the system s input - output relation .",
    "lti systems are therefore always identifiable , provided that the probing signal can have infinite bandwidth and we can observe the output signal over an infinite duration .    for ltv systems the situation is fundamentally different . specifically , kailath s landmark paper @xcite shows that an ltv system with spreading function compactly supported on a rectangle of area @xmath8 is identifiable if and only if @xmath9",
    ". this condition can be very restrictive .",
    "measurements of underwater acoustic communication channels , such as those reported in @xcite for example , show that the support area of the spreading function can be larger than @xmath10 . the measurements in @xcite exhibit , however , an interesting structural property : the nonzero components of the spreading function are scattered across the @xmath11-plane and the sum of the corresponding support areas , henceforth called `` overall support area '' , is smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "a similar situation arises in radar astronomy @xcite .",
    "bello @xcite shows that kailath s identifiability result continues to hold for arbitrarily fragmented spreading function support regions as long as the corresponding overall support area is smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "kozek and pfander @xcite and pfander and walnut @xcite found elegant functional - analytical identifiability proofs for setups that are more general than those originally considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the results in @xcite require the support region of @xmath4 to be known prior to identification , a condition that is very restrictive and often impossible to realize in practice .",
    "in the case of underwater acoustic communication channels , e.g. , the support area of @xmath4 depends critically on surface motion , water depth , and motion of transmitter and receiver . for wireless channels , knowing the spreading function s support region would amount to knowing the delays and doppler shifts induced by the scatterers in the propagation medium .",
    "[ [ contributions ] ] contributions + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we show that an operator with input - output relation is identifiable , without prior knowledge of the operator s spreading function support region and without limitations on its total extent , if and only if the spreading function s total support area satisfies @xmath0 .",
    "what is more , this factor - of - two penalty  relative to the case where the support region is known prior to identification @xcite  can be eliminated if one asks for identifiability of _ _ almost all _ _ operators only .",
    "this result is surprising as it says that ( for almost all operators ) there is no price to be paid for not knowing the spreading function s support region in advance .",
    "our findings have strong conceptual parallels to the theory of spectrum - blind sampling of sparse multi - band signals @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we present algorithms which , in the noiseless case , provably recover all operators with @xmath0 , and almost all operators with @xmath1 , without requiring prior knowledge of the spreading function s support region ; not even its area @xmath8 has to be known .",
    "specifically , we formulate the recovery problem as a continuous multiple measurement vector ( mmv ) problem @xcite .",
    "we then show that this problem can be reduced to a finite mmv problem @xcite .",
    "the reduction approach we present is of independent interest as it unifies a number of reduction approaches available in the literature and presents a simplified treatment .    in the case of wireless channels or radar systems ,",
    "the spreading function s support region is sparse and typically contained in a rectangle of area @xmath10 . in the spirit of compressed sensing , where sparse objects are reconstructed by taking fewer measurements than mandated by their `` bandwidth '' ,",
    "we show that in this case sparsity ( in the spreading function s support region ) can be exploited to identify the system while undersampling the response to the probing signal . in the case of channel identification",
    "this allows for a reduction of the identification time , and in radar systems it leads to increased resolution .",

    "the signal recovery problem in @xcite is a standard _ single measurement _ recovery problem @xcite .",
    "as we start from a continuous - time formulation we find that , depending on the resolution induced by the discretization through time / band - limitation , the resulting recovery problem can be an mmv problem .",
