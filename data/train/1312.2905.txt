    "surface partial differential equations or partial differential equations ( pdes ) on manifolds arise in a wide variety of applications in materials science , fluid dynamics and biology , @xcite .",
    "often the surface on which the pde holds is unknown and has to be found as part of the solution process .",
    "thus complex applications involving surfaces and interfaces frequently require the formulation and approximation of equations on unknown stationary and moving surfaces and are not only coupled to equations for the surface but also to equations holding in the bulk .",
    "a number of computational approaches have been developed in recent years , see @xcite .",
    "they are often designed in the context of solving the surface equations in a more complex application .",
    "in particular we mention:-    _ surface finite elements on triangulated surfaces _ : this approach was pioneered in @xcite for computing solutions to the poisson equation using piece - wise linear elements on triangulated surfaces .",
    "this was extended to nonlinear and fourth order surface parabolic equations in @xcite .",
    "using an appropriate weak formulation and the transport property of finite element basis functions an evolving surface finite element method was devised in @xcite in order to treat conservation laws on moving surfaces .",
    "the key idea is to use the leibniz ( or transport ) formula for the time derivative of integrals over moving surfaces in order to derive weak and variational formulations .",
    "further numerical analysis of surface finite element methods may be found in @xcite .",
    "_ bulk finite element or finite difference meshes for the approximation of implicit surface formulations _ : [ en : eulerian ] the idea here is to use implicit surface formulations .",
    "the starting point is to use a level set function @xmath21 to define a degenerate partial differential equation whose solution solves the surface equation on all level sets of @xmath21 .",
    "such methods are formulated in @xcite .",
    "approaches to obtaining a non - degenerate level set equation may be found in @xcite .",
    "_ bulk finite element or finite difference meshes on narrow bands _ : [ en : narrowband ] a natural disadvantage of the approach [ en : eulerian ] is the fact that formulation is in the ambient space rather than just on the surface .",
    "this leads to solving pdes in one space dimension higher than the hypersurface .",
    "narrow band methods confine the use of bulk finite elements to a narrow band around the surface and the region of integration is the narrow band . in particular",
    "the level set approach in @xcite is confined to an @xmath7-narrow band .",
    "another direction is to solve the bulk pde in a narrow band of width @xmath22 , say .",
    "the solution of this problem converges to the solution of the surface pde .",
    "this is the basis of the finite difference method in @xcite .    _",
    "bulk finite element methods and phase field diffuse interfaces _ : this approach is motivated by the diffuse interfaces that arise in phase field approximations of interface problems , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "bulk finite element meshes and sharp interface weak forms _ [ en : sharpinterface ] if one takes the width of the narrow band to be zero in the approach of @xcite one obtains the appealing method of @xcite for equations on stationary surfaces .",
    "the authors prove that for piece - wise linear elements one obtains second order convergence in the @xmath8 norm .",
    "there is an issue about the dimension of the resulting linear algebraic equations and their conditioning .",
    "this is addressed in @xcite . for other developments we refer to @xcite which concerns an adaptive version and @xcite which concerns the surface",
    "meshes induced by the bulk mesh on level sets.this approach has been extended recently to a novel eulerian space - time formulation using space - time bulk finite element meshes , @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the methods described above is the avoidance of _ charts _ both in the problem formulation and the numerical methods .",
    "for example , the surface finite element method is based simply on triangulated surfaces and requires the geometry solely through the knowledge of the vertices of the triangulation whereas methods based on implicit surfaces require only the level set function @xmath21 which encodes all the necessary geometry .",
    "another feature of some of these methods is the use of unfitted bulk meshes .",
    "here we use the terminology _ unfitted finite element methods _",
    "( sometimes called cut cell methods ) when the underlying meshes that form the computational domain are not fitted to the domain in which the pde holds . the motivation for using finite element spaces on meshes not fitting to",
    "the domain came from the desire to solve free or moving boundary problems .",
    "such methods were introduced in @xcite for elliptic equations in curved domains .",
    "see also @xcite . in this",
    "setting we are concerned with bulk meshes independent of the surface .",
    "the new unfitted finite element methods for surface elliptic equations proposed in this paper are variants of the bulk finite element approaches using a sharp interface or a narrow band .",
    "the new scheme for advection diffusion on an evolving surface is a hybrid of these . in the following we sketch the main ideas of these methods describing the details in  [ sif]-[hybridmoving ] .",
    "given an interpolation @xmath5 of @xmath6 , we use a bulk finite element space @xmath23 of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a set of elements which intersect @xmath5 and @xmath26 , see  [ sif ] .",
    "the discrete scheme approximating the model elliptic equation is:- find @xmath27 such that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an extension of @xmath30 .",
    "the method is related to the following method of olshanskii et .",

    "however , while @xmath35 has a natural basis , this does not seem to be the case for @xmath33 .",
    "we use the bulk finite element space @xmath36 on the triangulation @xmath37 @xmath38 here @xmath39 consists of those triangles intersecting a narrow band domain @xmath40 defined by the @xmath41 level sets of an interpolated level set function @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the discrete scheme approximating the model elliptic equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) is:- find @xmath44 such that @xmath45    this is similar to the method in @xcite except that _ nbm _ uses the full instead of projected gradients thus avoiding the resulting degeneracy . as a result",
    "we are able to prove an optimal @xmath46-error bound which was not obtained for the method in @xcite .",
    "it is also the case that the normal derivative of the discrete solution converges to zero .",
