    "galaxy formation is one of the most fundamental problems in astrophysics . to understand how galaxies form , we need to unravel how stars form from the primordial gas and how the first stars interact with their surrounding environments .",
    "as there are no heavy elements in the early universe , the thermodynamic behaviour of the gas is essentially controlled by h@xmath6 cooling , and the first population iii stars are expected to be very massive and hot ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their effective temperatures are around 10@xmath7 k , so they emit very hard ionizing radiation with photon energies exceeding 4 ryd ( 54.4 ev ) .",
    "these first stars are thus very effective in ionizing hydrogen and helium ( twice ) , and strong he ii emission lines are expected to be present in the spectra of primeval galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "emission lines of high - ionization ions of heavy elements should be present as well .    while much progress has been made in finding large populations of galaxies at high ( @xmath8 ) redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , truly young galaxies in the process of forming remain elusive in the distant universe .",
    "the spectra of those far - away galaxies generally indicate the presence of a substantial amount of heavy elements , implying previous star formation and metal enrichment .    instead of focussing on high - redshift galaxies",
    ", another approach is to study the properties of the massive stellar populations and their interaction with the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) in a class of nearby metal - deficient dwarf galaxies called blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies , some of which are thought to be undergoing their first episode of star formation @xcite .",
    "these galaxies have a heavy element mass fraction @xmath9 in the range 1/50  1/3 @xmath10 @xcite , assuming a solar oxygen abundance 12 + log ( o / h)@xmath11 = 8.91 .",
    "thus , their massive stellar populations have properties intermediate between those of massive stars in solar - metallicity galaxies such as the milky way and those of the first stars .",
    "bcds constitute then excellent nearby laboratories for studying high - ionization emission and the hardness of the ionizing radiation in a very metal - deficient environment .",
    "the hardness of the ionizing radiation in bcds has long been known to increase with decreasing metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is supported by the fact that the strong nebular emission line he ii @xmath04686 is often seen in the spectra of bcds , with a flux which increases with decreasing metallicity of the ionized gas @xcite . besides he ii emission , high - ionization emission lines of heavy elements ions are also seen in the spectra of some bcds . @xcite and",
    "@xcite first detected the high - ionization emission line [ fe v ] @xmath04227 in the bcds tol 1214277 and sbs 0335052 .",
    "the presence of this line , just as that of the he ii @xmath04686 line , requires ionizing radiation with photon energies in excess of 4 ryd .",
    "more impressively , @xcite discovered [ fe vi ]  [ fe vii ] emission in sbs 0335052 implying that this bcd contains intense radiation with photon energies above @xmath4 7 ryd ( @xmath4 100 ev ) , i.e. in the range of soft x - rays .",
    "note that the ionization potential of fe@xmath12 is 5.5 ryd and that of fe@xmath13 is 7.3 ryd .",
    "later , @xcite discovered [ ne v ] @xmath03346 , 3426 emission lines in the spectrum of tol 1214277 .",
    "the existence of these lines requires the presence of hard radiation with photon energies above 7.1 ryd .",
    "such hard ionizing radiation is confirmed by the detection of [ ne iv ] ( the ionization potential of ne@xmath14 is 4.7 ryd ) and [ fe vi ]  [ fe vii ] emission in a new spectrum of tol 1214277 @xcite .",
    "while the presence of hard radiation is well established in some bcds , the origin of this radiation is much less clear , in spite of several attempts to account for it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several mechanisms for producing hard ionizing radiation have been proposed , such as massive main - sequence stars @xcite , wolf - rayet stars @xcite , primordial zero - metallicity stars @xcite , high - mass x - ray binaries @xcite and fast radiative shocks @xcite .",
    "however , no mechanism has emerged clearly as the leading candidate , mainly because of the lack of a large data base to confront the models with observations . despite the importance of understanding the high - ionization phenomenon to interpret the spectra of primordial star - forming galaxies when these are discovered in the future , very few observations of high - ionization emission lines in metal - deficient bcds exist .",
    "the he ii @xmath04686 emission line has been detected in only a few dozens bcds , and [ ne v ] and [ fe v ]  [ fe vii ] emission has been seen in only two bcds @xcite .",
    "this scarcity of data is partly due to the faintness of these high - ionization lines ( less than 5% of the flux of h@xmath15 in the case of he ii @xmath04686 , and less than 2% of h@xmath15 in the case of the [ ne v ] @xmath03346 , 3426 emission lines ) and their detection requires a 4 m - class telescope or larger . to increase the number of known bcds with high - ionization emission lines , and construct a reasonably large sample with which to study statistical trends of high - ionization emission with metallicity and other parameters ,",
    "we have embarked in a program to obtain high signal - to - noise spectra in the blue wavelength region of a selected sample of bcds with the 6.5 m mmt . to augment our sample ,",
    "we have also carried out a systematic search of the data release 3 ( dr3 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite for emission line galaxies with detected he ii @xmath04686 and [ fe v ] @xmath04227 emission lines . finally , for our statistical studies",
    ", we have also included several more bcds with detected he ii @xmath04686 emission and three bcds with detected [ fe v ] @xmath04227 emission from the sample which @xcite used to determine the primordial helium abundance .",
    "we describe the new observational data in section [ observ ] , and how we derive element abundances in section [ abund ] .",
    "we describe in section [ sample ] our sample of galaxies with high - ionization emission lines assembled from present and previous spectroscopic work .",
    "we use that sample for statistical studies of the high - ionization emission in section [ high ] .",
    "we discuss possible mechanisms for the hard radiation in section [ nature ] .",
    "we explore how the compactness of the star - forming region may play a role in high - ionization emission in section [ compact ] , and summarize our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "we have obtained new high signal - to - noise ratio spectrophotometric observations for 26 h ii regions in 18 bcds and for one supergiant h ii region in the spiral galaxy m101 with the 6.5-meter mmt on the nights of 2004 february 19  20 and 2005 february 4 . in selecting the observational sample ,",
    "we have been guided by several considerations .",
    "first , we wish the equivalent width of the h@xmath15 emission line in the h ii regions to span a reasonably large range .",
    "since ew(h@xmath15 ) is an indicator of the age of the most recent burst of star formation in the bcd , this ensures that our bcd sample spans a large burst age range , and gives us some handle on the time scale of the high - ionization emission phenomenon .",
    "second , since the study of how high - ionization emission depends on metallicity is one of our main scientific objectives , we have chosen h ii regions with metallicities spanning the entire metallicity range of bcds , from @xmath4 @xmath10/50 to @xmath4 @xmath10/3 .",
    "third , we have been careful to include bcds with and without wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars since we want to study whether high - ionization emission is correlated or not with the presence of wr stars .",
    "fourth , we have included objects known from previous spectroscopic work ( our 4 m or sdss spectra ) to have high - ionization emission , he ii @xmath04686 or [ fe v ] @xmath04227 lines , to check if the presence of these lines necessarily implies that higher ionization lines are present .",
    "finally , we also include bcds with different morphologies .",
    "star formation in bcds appears to occur in two different modes : a relatively quiescent `` passive '' mode without super - star cluster ( ssc ) formation , with a low star formation rate ( sfr ) in a diffuse star - forming region , and a considerably more `` active '' mode with ssc formation , a high sfr in a very compact star - forming region .",
    "this will allow us to check whether the presence of high - ionization emission is related to the compactness of the h ii region .",
    "the 18 bcds and the h ii region in the spiral galaxy m101 observed with the mmt are listed in table [ tab1 ] in order of increasing right ascension , along with some of their general properties such as coordinates , apparent magnitudes , redshifts and absolute magnitudes .",
    "in addition , we have also included in table [ tab1 ] bcds previously observed with other telescopes which show in their spectra the high - ionization [ fe v ] @xmath04227 emission line .",
    "three bcds were observed by @xcite with the kitt peak 4 m telescope and five others were selected from the dr3 of the sdss @xcite .",
    "all observations were made with the blue channel of the mmt spectrograph .",
    "we used a 2@xmath16@xmath17300@xmath16 slit and a 800 grooves / mm grating in first order .",
    "the above instrumental set - up gave a spatial scale along the slit of 06 pixel@xmath2 , a scale perpendicular to the slit of 0.75  pixel@xmath2 , a spectral range of 32005200  and a spectral resolution of @xmath4 3  ( fwhm ) .",
    "the seeing was in the range 1@xmath182@xmath18 .",
    "total exposure times varied between 10 and 105 minutes .",
    "each exposure was broken up into 27 subexposures , not exceeding 15 minutes , to allow for removal of cosmic rays .",
    "three kitt peak irs spectroscopic standard stars , g191b2b , feige 34 and hz 44 were observed at the beginning , middle and end of each night for flux calibration .",
    "spectra of he  ar comparison arcs were obtained before and after each observation to calibrate the wavelength scale .",
    "the log of the observations is given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were bias subtracted and flat - field corrected using iraf .",
    "we then use the iraf software routines identify , reidentify , fitcoord , transform to perform wavelength calibration and correct for distortion and tilt for each frame .",
    "night sky subtraction was performed using the routine background .",
    "the level of night sky emission was determined from the closest regions to the galaxy that are free of galaxian stellar and nebular line emission , as well as of emission from foreground and background sources .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were then extracted from each two - dimensional frame using the apall routine . before extraction , distinct two - dimensional spectra of the same h ii region",
    "were carefully aligned using the spatial locations of the brightest part in each spectrum , so that spectra were extracted at the same positions in all subexposures .",
    "for all objects , we extracted the brightest part of the bcd , using a 6@xmath172  extraction aperture . in the case of five bcds ,",
    "mrk 71 , i zw 18 , mrk 35 , mrk 178 and mrk 59 , spectra of 2  3 different h ii regions in the same galaxy were extracted .",
    "all extracted spectra from the same object were then co - added .",
    "we have summed the individual spectra from each subexposure after manual removal of the cosmic rays hits .",
    "the spectra obtained from each subexposure were also checked for cosmic rays hits at the location of strong emission lines , but none was found .",
    "particular attention was paid to the derivation of the sensitivity curve .",
    "it was obtained by fitting with a high - order polynomial the observed spectral energy distribution of the bright hot white dwarf standard stars g191b2b , feige 34 and hz 44 . because the spectra of these stars have only a small number of a relatively weak absorption features , their spectral energy distributions are known with very good accuracy @xcite . moreover",
    ", the response function of the ccd detector is smooth , so we could derive a sensitivity curve with a precision better than 1% over the whole optical range .",
    "we show in figure [ fig1 ] the spectrum with labeled emission lines of one of the most interesting bcds in our sample , sbs 0335052e .",
    "this bcd with a metallicity of only @xmath4 2.5% that of the sun @xcite , is one of the most metal - deficient star - forming galaxies known in the local universe .",
    "it has a sfr of @xmath4 0.4 @xmath5 yr@xmath2 and most of the star formation occurs in six sscs within a region of @xmath4 500 pc in size @xcite .",
    "several high - ionization emission lines are seen in its spectrum .",
    "in addition to the [ fe v ] @xmath04227 emission line already discussed by @xcite and @xcite , we report here the discovery of the [ ne iv ] @xmath04725 and [ ne v ] @xmath03346 , 3426 emission lines .",
    "this makes sbs 0335052e only the second bcd known to have [ ne iv ] and [ ne v ] emission , after tol 1214277 @xcite .",
    "this discovery confirms and strengthens the finding by @xcite who discovered [ fe vi ]  [ fe vii ] emission in sbs 0335052e and concluded that ionizing radiation above @xmath4 7 ryd must be intense in this galaxy .",
    "we note that , except for a very few papers from our group ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the 32003700   spectral region has not been explored extensively before for bcds .",
    "not only does this spectral region contain the high - ionization [ ne v ] lines discussed before , it also includes the balmer jump , he i recombination lines , and in the case of sbs 0335052e which has a higher redshift , the he ii @xmath03203 line .",
    "the spectra for the other 26 h ii regions observed with the mmt are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",

    "the mmt observations show conclusively that the ionized gas in the c component of i zw 18 does contain heavy elements , just as its main component .",
    "we also point out the detection of the bowen fluorescent o iii @xmath03092 emission line @xcite in the spectrum of the highest - redshift bcd in the sample , j 0519 + 0007 ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this is the first such detection in the spectra of a low - metallicity bcd .",

    "they were measured using the iraf splot routine .",
    "the line flux errors listed include statistical errors derived with splot from non - flux calibrated spectra , in addition to errors introduced in the standard star absolute flux calibration .",
    "since the differences between the response curves derived for the three standard stars are not greater than 1% , we set the errors in flux calibration to 1% of the line fluxes .",
    "the line flux errors will be later propagated into the calculation of abundance errors .",

    "thus , the hardness of the ionizing radiation with photon energy above 4 ryd does not appear to depend on starburst age .",
    "there are however two features to notice in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] which constrain the nature of the source of ionizing radiation .",
    "first , in very young bursts with ew(h@xmath15 ) @xmath1 300  corresponding to a starburst age of @xmath4 3  4 myr , there is a clear absence of strong he ii emission .",
    "such ages correspond to lifetimes of very massive stars , with masses @xmath4 100 @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that the ionizing radiation responsible for he ii @xmath04686 emission probably does not come from massive stars in their main - sequence phase , but rather in their post - main - sequence phase .",
    "second , strong he ii @xmath04686 emission is detected in many starbursts with ew(h@xmath15 ) @xmath4 50 ",
    "300 , corresponding to starburst ages in the range @xmath4 3 - 10 myr .",
    "such ages correspond to lifetimes of main sequence stars in the mass range from from 50 to 15 @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it appears that , not only the most massive evolved stars are responsible for the hard ionizing radiation , but also less massive stars and/or their descendants and remnants .",
    "next , we explore other possible sources of hard ionizing radiation in low - metallicity bcds .",
    "if present photoinization models of main - sequence stars can not account for the intensity of nebular he ii @xmath04686 emission , models for post - main sequence wolf - rayet stars also fail .",
    "@xcite has synthesized the nebular and wolf - rayet he ii @xmath04686 emission in young starbursts . for heavy element mass fractions @xmath10/5",

    "it is found that more than 90% of its 0.5  10 kev ( or 1  25 ) flux comes from a point - source with a luminosity of 3.5 @xmath17 10@xmath42 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "if that point source is composed of a single object , then its luminosity would place it in the range of the so - called ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the high x - ray luminosities of these sources may be due to a metallicity effect .",
    "the x - ray heating of the gas as it falls toward a compact object depends strongly on the atomic number z , since the photoelectric cross - section varies as z@xmath26 .",
    "thus in low - metallicity systems , the x - ray heating is less , resulting in a larger accretion rate and x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is also plausible that a lower gaseous metallicity may also result in higher mass accreting black holes , first by allowing the formation of more massive progenitor stars because of reduced cooling , and second by helping the formation of a more massive compact object from a normal progenitor ob star .",
    "a lower metallicity results in the reduction of the mass - loss rate in the radiatively driven winds , leading to a more massive stellar core , which may then collapse into a more massive black hole .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the point source in sbs 0335052e is well fitted by a moderately soft power law @xcite , typical of x - ray emission from hmxbs .",
    "the observed [ ne v ] @xmath03426/[ne iii ] @xmath03868 flux ratio in sbs 0335052e is @xmath4 2.7 times smaller than that in tol1214277 ( table 7 ) , so that the x - ray luminosity of the ulx observed in it @xcite , can in principle account for the [ ne v ] emission .",
    "however , based on the very scarce x - ray data on low - metallicity bcds , there does not appear to be a one - to - one correlation between the presence of a ulx and [ ne v ] emission .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) of the bcds i zw 18 with a metallicity of about 2% that of the sun , and mrk 59 with a metallicity of about 12% that of the sun , although a x - ray point - source has been detected in i zw 18 @xcite , and two in mrk 59 ( thuan et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , with x - ray luminosities comparable to the one in sbs 0335052e @xcite .",
    "this lack of correlation appears to rule out hmxbs as mainly responsible for the high - ionization [ ne v ] @xmath03426 emission .",
    "@xcite have suggested that fast radiative shocks in giant h ii regions can produce relatively strong he ii emission under certain conditions .",
    "hydrodynamical models by @xcite have indeed shown that fast shocks are an efficient means to generate a strong local uv photon field in the ism of a galaxy .",
    "the total optical and uv emission from the shock and the precursor region scales as the mechanical energy flux through the shock .",
    "the h@xmath15 luminosity generated in the shock region which measures the number of recombinations that occur in the ionized gas column behind the shock provides a convenient way for estimating the total mechanical energy dissipation rate through the shock structure . with shock velocities of @xmath4 400  500 km s@xmath2 ,",
    "examination of the @xcite models shows that if the h@xmath15 luminosity generated in the shock region is several percent of the h@xmath15 luminosity produced by massive stars , such shocks can be responsible for the observed fluxes of both the he ii @xmath04686and [ ne v ] @xmath03346 , 3426  emission lines for all four bcds with [ ne v ] @xmath03346 , 3426 emission , the spectra of which are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) , hs 0837 + 4717 and mrk 209 ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) and tol 1214277 ( fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the broad component fluxes are @xmath4 1%  2% of the narrow component fluxes .",
    "the full widths at half maximum fwhm @xmath1 15   of the broad components correspond to gas velocities in expanding shells of @xmath1 900/2 km s@xmath2 = 450 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the [ ne v ] emission and the broad components in the 4 bcds appear to be related to the evolution of the most massive stars .",

    "100 @xmath5 star .",
    "thus , on the basis of a meager sample of four objects , [ ne v ] @xmath03426 emission does appear to be accompanied by fast gas velocities of @xmath4 450 km s@xmath2 , in the range of velocities expected to be produced by fast shocks .",
    "however , the reverse is not true : the presence of broad components is not necessarily accompanied by high - ionization emission . for example",
    ", broad wings of the strong emission lines are also seen in the spectra of ii zw 40 , mrk 71 and mrk 59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . however , their spectra which have a comparable signal - to - noise ratio , do not show [ ne v ] @xmath03426 emission .",
    "metallicity probably plays a role here .",
    "the latter three galaxies with broad wings of the strong emission lines but without [ ne v ] emission are all more metal - rich ( their 12 + log o / h are respectively 8.1 , 7.9 and 8.0 ) than the four bcds with broad wings and [ ne v ] emission ( their 12 + log o / h are respectively 7.3 , 7.6 , 7.8 and 7.5 ) . it is probable that in higher - metallicity bcds , for a given shock velocity , the shock - heated ionized gas cools more efficiently and hence the high - ionization postshock region is narrower , so that the fraction of highly ionized ions is lower than that in lower - metallicity bcds . unfortunately , we can not check this metallicity dependence directly with hydrodynamical calculations as @xcite computed only models with solar metallicity .    in summary , existing models of massive main - sequence stars and of post - main - sequence wolf - rayet stars are unable to account for the hard radiation responsible for he ii @xmath04686 emission , let alone for the considerably harder radiation responsible for [ ne v ] @xmath03426 emission .",
    "hmxbs may play a role although the scarce x - ray data on high - ionization bcds show that there is not a one - to - one relationship between x - ray and [ ne v ] @xmath03426 emission .",
    "fast radiative shocks with velocities @xmath4 450 km s@xmath2 associated with the evolution of massive ( @xmath44 @xmath4 50 ",
    "100 @xmath5 ) stars appear to be the best candidate in town .",
    "the presence of such fast motions is supported by the broad components observed in the line profiles of the strong emission lines .",
    "fast radiative shocks are also able to account for the general trend of more intense high - ionization emission at lower metallicities , since the high - ionization postshock region should become wider with decreasing heavy element abundances and less cooling .",
    "we discuss in this section how the compactness of the star - forming regions in bcds may play an important role in the high - ionization phenomenon .",
    "one striking common feature which links the bcds with detected [ ne v ] @xmath03426 emission in fig .",

    "a pixel corresponds to a spatial extent of 50 pc at the distance of 103 mpc of the bcd .",

    "if this luminosity comes from a single object , then the brightness of the ssc in tol 1214277 would be more than 5 times brighter than the brightest ssc in sbs 0335052e @xcite .",
    "however , because tol 1214277 is nearly 2 times more distant than sbs 0335052e , the linear resolution is poor and we can not exclude the possibility that the star - forming region is composed of several sscs .",

    "both these linear sizes and luminosities put the star clusters in mrk 209 in the category of sscs .",

    "the compactness of the star - forming region thus appears to play a key role in the production of high - ionization radiation with photon energy above 7.1 ryd .",
    "based on the detailed study of two of the most metal - deficient bcds known , i zw 18 and sbs 0335052e , star formation in bcds appears to occur in two quite different modes : sbs 0335052e makes stars in an `` active '' mode characterized by ssc formation , a high star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath4 0.4 @xmath5 yr@xmath2 @xcite , a compact size , hot dust , and significant amounts of h@xmath53 , while i zw 18 is characterized by a more quiescent `` passive '' mode with an absence of sscs , a low sfr [ some 8 times less than in sbs 0335052e , @xcite ] , a larger size with cooler dust and no significant amount of h@xmath53 . for the purpose of our discussion , we will call `` active '' bcds those with sscs , and `` passive '' bcds those without . clearly , metallicity is not the distinguishing factor between sbs 0335052e and i zw 18 since both bcds have similar heavy element abundance .",
    "theoretical models @xcite suggest that the difference between the two modes can be understood through a difference in size and density of the star - forming regions .",
    "the active mode occurs in regions which are compact ( with radius @xmath35 50 pc ) and dense ( with gas number density @xmath1 500 @xmath3 ) as in sbs 0335052e . on the other hand ,",
    "the passive mode occurs in regions that are diffuse ( with radius @xmath1 100 pc ) and less dense ( with gas number density @xmath35 100 @xmath3 ) as in i zw 18 .    our preferred mechanism for the source of hard ionizing radiation , fast radiative shocks , would work best in dense environments with electron number densities of several hundreds per @xmath3 , similar to those in `` active '' low - metallicity bcds with ssc formation .",
    "the luminosities in emission lines scale as the square of the electron number density .",
    "therefore , shocks moving through a dense ism can radiate more and produce high [ ne v ] emission - line luminosities . the electron number densities @xmath25(s ii ) are indeed high in at least three bcds with [ ne v ] emission : @xmath25(s ii ) = 390 @xmath3 for sbs 0335052 @xcite , 400 @xmath3 for tol 1214277 @xcite and 300  400 @xmath3 for hs 0837 + 4717 @xcite . as for mrk 209 where [ ne v ] emission is tentatively detected ,",
    "its electron number density is lower , @xmath25(s ii ) @xmath35 100 @xmath3 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission - line luminosities of postshock regions in the low - density ism of `` passive '' bcds without ssc formation are expected to be considerably lower , and any [ ne v ] emission would go undetected .    however , if the presence of fast shocks and dense stellar clusters is a necessary condition for [ ne v ] emission , it is not a sufficient condition .",
    "[ ne v ] emission is absent in higher - metallicity bcds , such as ii zw 40 , mrk 59 and mrk 71 , despite the presence of compact stellar clusters ( as examination of archival _ hst _ images shows ) , and of broad components of the strong emission lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a low - metallicity ism is also needed .",
    "thus , the presence of [ ne v ] emission requires the following three conditions to be fulfilled simultaneously : 1 ) a low gaseous metallicity ; 2 ) the presence of fast shocks and 3 ) a dense ism and compact stellar clusters .",
    "it thus appears that the very high - ionization radiation with photon energy greater than 7.1 ryd is associated with very dense star - forming regions . to check for the compactness of the [ ne v ] @xmath03426 emission , we have plotted in fig .",

    "these distributions are similar to those obtained by @xcite .",
    "in particular , we confirm the excess of he ii @xmath04686 emission in the shell at an angular distance of 55 to the northwest of ssc 1 [ see fig .",
    "10 of @xcite ] .",
    "this excess emission at a location where there is no visible star cluster supports the hypothesis that he ii emission in sbs 0335052e is due mainly to radiative shocks .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] that the spatial distribution of [ ne v ] @xmath03426 emission is more compact than those of other high - ionization ions .",
    "thus , although the maxima of both [ ne v ] @xmath03426 and he ii @xmath04686 emissions are between sscs 1,2 and sscs 4,5 [ the ssc notation of @xcite is used ] , the spatial distribution of the [ ne v ] emission is not as extended as that of the he ii emission .",
    "this observation has two consequences .",
    "first , it supports our previous conclusion that very hard ionizing radiation is associated with the active mode of star formation in bcds with very compact star - forming regions .",
    "second , it implies that the source of very hard radiation ( with photon energy @xmath1 7 ryd ) responsible for the [ ne v ] emission is distinct spatially from the source of moderate ionizing radiation ( with photon energy between 4 and 7 ryd ) responsible for the he ii and [ fe v ] emission ( fig . [ fig10]a ) .",
    "comparison of the high - ionization emission of two of the most - metal deficient bcds known in the local universe , i zw 18 and sbs 0335052e , supports that contention . despite very similar strengths of the he ii @xmath04686 emission line relative to h@xmath15 in the two bcds , strong [ ne v ] @xmath03346,3426 emission is seen only in sbs 0335052e but not in i zw 18 .",
    "their nearly equal metallicities suggest once again that metallicity is not the only factor which controls the amount of hard ionizing radiation relative to moderate ionizing radiation .",
    "[ fig10]b also shows that he ii @xmath04686 emission does not follow [ o iii ] @xmath05007 emission . while the latter is strongest at the location of ssc 1 , the former is offset in the direction of sscs 4 and 5 .",
    "this feature has been noted before by @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the extended he ii @xmath04686 emission is due mainly to the ionizing radiation from radiative shocks , in contrast to the [ o iii ] @xmath05007 emission which originates mainly from the ionizing radiation of main - sequence stars .",

    "we have thus assembled 15 bcds with [ fe v ] @xmath04227 emission and 465 bcds with he ii @xmath04686 emission .",
    "studies of statistical trends in the resulting sample yield the following main results :    \\1 ) there is a general tendency for higher he ii , [ fe v ] and [ ne v ] emission at lower metallicities",
    ". the hardness of the radiation as measured by the flux ratios of emission lines for different ions of the same element also increases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "however the scatter is large indicating that metallicity is not the only parameter which controls the hardness of the ionizing radiation .",
    "\\2 ) the hardness of the ionizing radiation with photon energy greater than 4 ryd does not depend on the burst age as measured by the equivalent width of h@xmath15 , ew(h@xmath15 ) .",
    "there is a clear absence of he ii emission in very young 3  4 myr starbursts with ew(h@xmath15 ) @xmath1 300  , implying that the source of ionization is not massive stars in their main - sequence phase , but in their post - main - sequence phase .",
    "strong he ii emission is seen in starbursts with ew(h@xmath15 ) @xmath4 50  300  , suggesting that less massive stars and their descendants also contribute radiation to ionize helium .",
    "present photoionization models of main - sequence and of wolf - rayet stars can not account for the observed he ii emission .",
    "\\3 ) the x - ray luminosity in luminous high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) observed in a few very metal - deficient bcds can account for their [ ne v ] emission .",
    "however , the scarce x - ray data does not show a one - to - one correlation between the presence of a hmxb and [ ne v ] emission , so that hmxbs are probably ruled out as the main source of hard ionizing radiation with energy above 7.1 ryd .",
    "\\4 ) the most likely source of [ ne v ] emission is probably fast radiative shocks moving with velocities @xmath4 450 km s@xmath2 through a dense ism with electron number densities of several hundreds @xmath3 .",
    "these shocks are probably produced via the evolution of massive stars with masses of @xmath4 50 ",
    "100 @xmath5 , formed in very compact and dense super - star clusters ( sscs ) .",
    "these fast radiative shocks are evidenced by broad components in the line profiles of the strong emission lines .",
    "however the presence of compact sscs and broad components is not necessarily accompanied by high - ionization emission .",
    "metallicity appears to play an important role .",
    "[ ne v ] emission is detected only in low - metallicity galaxies with 12 + log o / h @xmath35 7.8 . in higher - metallicity galaxies with higher",
    "metallicity the postshock regions are cooled more efficiently .",
    "therefore , their high - ionization regions are smaller and their emission lower .",
    "\\5 ) the spatial distribution of [ ne v ] emission is more compact than that of he ii emission , suggesting spatially distinct sources of ionizing radiation for the two . while [ ne v ] emission requires hard radiation produced by fast radiative shocks moving through a dense interstellar medium , and probably associated with the evolution of the most massive stars , softer ionizing radiation , likely associated with the evolution of less massive stars and/or radiative shocks moving through a lower density ism ,",
