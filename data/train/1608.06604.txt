    "our result immediately implies the same universal bound ( though without the sharp constant ) since @xmath14 contains large portions of a ball whose radius already implies the desired bound on the volume .",

    "the following consequence of the main result is a further instance of the connection between the laplacian eigenfunction and the torsion function .",
    "there exists a universal constant @xmath0 such that for every bounded , simply connected @xmath1 for which the first laplacian eigenfunction assumes a global maximum in @xmath5 @xmath68    generically , and perhaps for all convex domains , the constant is remarkably close to 1 .",
    "we illustrate this with an example that was essentially picked at random : let the boundary of @xmath14 be given by ( see fig .",
    "2 ) @xmath69        the maxima of torsion function and eigenfunction are marked in the picture : they are at a distance of roughly @xmath70 from each other and we have @xmath71 we emphasize that this example was essentially picked at random and one really seems to get comparable results for most domains . the best upper bound we found through extensive numerical simulations is @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "the boundary of the corresponding domain is given by @xmath73 the domain is rather delicate : the laplacian eigenfunction can not localize in any of the two balls and is forced to be fairly central while the torsion function can localize to a stronger extent .",
    "indeed , their maxima are at distance @xmath74 .",
    "this shows that the close proximity of these two maxima that was observed in @xcite is not always the case ( and likely a result of the presence of an axis of symmetry and convexity of the domains considered in @xcite ) .",
