    "the noisiness of a quantum channel is closely related to its ability to transfer information , and is reflected in the values of the various channel capacities .",
    "much work has been done on understanding the capacities , for example @xcite provides a recent survey .",
    "these capacities are sometimes difficult to analyze directly , for example the holevo capacity is computed using multiple output states . accordingly other more mathematically tractable quantities have been used to measure the amount of noise introduced by the channel .",
    "one example is the minimal output renyi entropy @xcite of a channel @xmath5 , defined for @xmath6 : @xmath7 at @xmath8 this yields the minimal output von neumann entropy , which has a close connection to the classical capacity of the channel @xcite .",
    "the entropies for @xmath9 also provide useful properties of the channel , and in some cases are easier to analyze and compute .",
    "the famous additivity conjecture concerns the regularized version of this quantity , which is defined as @xmath10 ( the existence of the limit is an easy consequence of the sub - additivity bound @xmath11 ) .",
    "while the inequality @xmath12 is always true , it was an open question for several years whether equality holds .",
    "it is now known that equality does not hold in general @xcite , so this raises the interesting question of determining @xmath13 . except for those channels where additivity does hold ,",
    "the value of this regularized quantity is unknown . for channels with non - additive holevo capacity the classical capacity",
    "is also defined by such a regularized quantity , so it is an important problem to find new ways to calculate these regularized limits . in a sense",
    "we follow a strategy opposite to the random channel methods used to disprove the additivity conjecture ; our high - dimensional channels are products of fixed channels , and thus are constructed explicitly .    in the hopes of finding some new insights into these regularized channel properties we consider a related quantity which also measures the noisiness of the channel , namely the average output renyi entropy .",
    "this measures the entropy of the channel output for typical input states , rather than the smallest value which is used to compute the minimal output entropy . for a finite - dimensional channel",
    "this is defined for all @xmath6 by @xmath14 where the expectation is computed using the uniform probability measure on the set of input pure states .",
    "we also consider the related quantity @xmath15 note that by jensen s inequality @xmath16 these quantities can be computed ( at least numerically ) for any given channel . in operational terms",
    ", they describe the long - run average output renyi entropy of the channel for a sequence of random pure input states . loosely speaking , they measure the average noisiness of an output state from the channel .    as with the minimal renyi entropy",
    ", we also consider the regularized versions of these quantities .",
    "however unlike the minimal renyi entropy , the existence of these regularized limits is not obvious , so we define them conservatively using the @xmath17 : @xmath18 we conjecture that the two quantities in are equal , however we do not yet have a proof of this for a general channel . for the specific channels we look at in more detail the quantity @xmath19",
    "is given by the expression above with @xmath17 replaced by @xmath20 .",
    "but from the closed expression for @xmath21 presented below there is a possibility for more complex limiting behavior .",
    "for one special class of channels we can compute a simple formula for @xmath21 for integer values of @xmath22 .",
    "these are a subset of the entanglement breaking ( e - b ) channels @xcite , which can be written in the form @xmath23  for some states @xmath24 and with @xmath25 a povm  meeting the additional condition @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    "this includes all the e - b channels . for higher @xmath22 a particular class of e - b channels that fulfill the condition",
    "are the qc channels as defined by holevo @xcite , where @xmath28 are pure states formed by an orthonormal basis . for unital e - b channels which satisfy the condition on the @xmath29 we can prove even more , namely that @xmath30=@xmath21 = @xmath31 .",
