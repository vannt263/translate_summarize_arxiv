    "in this paper , we suggest one plausible explanation for the peculiar dust cloud of ( 596 ) scheila .",
    "\\(596 ) scheila is a large asteroid ( 113120 km in diameter ) orbiting the sun in the outer region of the main belt with the orbital period of 5.01 years @xcite .",
    "the orbital elements of the object are typical for the outer main - belt , that is , the semi - major axis , the eccentricity and the inclination are 2.93au , 0.164 , and 14.7 . an unexpected dust cloud of ( 596 ) scheila was discovered on 2010 december 11.4 with the 0.68-m f/1.8 schmidt telescope @xcite .",
    "the observation with the same instruments on 2010 december 3.4 showed a diffuseness at magnitude 13.2 , about 1.3 mag brighter than that of the observation in the previous month @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the dust particles ranging from 0.11   to 100   were ejected impulsively on 2010 december 3.5 @xmath21.0 through the synchrone analysis of extended dust structure appeared after 2011 february .",
    "it is therefore likely that @xcite observed ( 596 ) scheila immediately after the dust emission .",
    "the total mass of the ejecta was estimated to be ( 0.26 ) @xmath3 10@xmath4 kg , depending on the assumed particle size and the mass density @xcite .",
    "to date , gas emission has never been detected @xcite . accordingly , it is natural to think that the comet - like activity was triggered by an impact .",
    "the impactor diameter was estimated to be 2050 m @xcite .",
    "similar evidence for asteroid ",
    "asteroid impact was reported in another object .",
    "the dust cloud of p/2010 a2 ( linear ) was discovered on 2010 january 6 , showing not only a comet - like extended dust cloud but also a mysterious x - shaped debris pattern @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the dust ejecta was created by the impact of a small objects in 2009 february or march ( about 10 months before the discovery ) , although it can not be ruled out that the asteroid s rotational spin - up resulted in a mass loss that formed a comet - like debris tail @xcite .",
    "the morphology of ( 596 ) scheila s dust cloud was also mysterious , in that it consisted of three prominent structures .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( a ) shows the image taken on 2010 december 12 at ishigakijima astronomical observatory with 1-m telescope and a 3ch ( the g , rc , and ic - bands ) simultaneously imaging system . in the image , three components appear : the northern tail , southern tail , and westward tail @xcite .",
    "similar structures were found in @xcite . to date",
    ", no studies have addressed the physical implication of the mysterious morphologies of impact - triggered dust clouds . in this paper",
    ", we attempted to reconstruct the observed morphology of ( 596 ) scheila s triple dust tails on the basis of the impact hypothesis . the image taken on 2010 december 12 at ishigakijima astronomical observatory",
    "was compared to the model which considers the laboratory measurement of high velocity impact and dust dynamics , and derive the best - fit parameters .",
    "as a beginning we would like to clarify difference in shape between normal comets and ( 596 ) scheila .",
    "the morphology of ( 596 ) scheila can not be explained by the sublimation of ice .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the results of model simulations on 2010 december 12 performed under the assumption of comet - like dust ejection .",
    "we applied continuous dust - ejection models using the parameters of 238p / read as an analog of a main - belt comet that was activated by the sublimation of ice @xcite ( figure  [ fig1 ] ( b ) ) , and those of 22p / kopff as an analog of a jupiter - family comet @xcite ( figure  [ fig1 ] ( c ) ) . in these models , it is assumed that dust particles are ejected in cone - shape jets that are radially symmetric with respect to the sun - object axis with a half - opening angle of 45   ( 238p / read ) and 60   ( 22p / kopff ) .",
    "we considered continuous dust emission from two months prior to the observation on 2010 december 12 . in these model images ,",
    "the dust cloud smoothly extended in an almost anti - solar direction .",
    "there is only one dust tail in these images . the observed image differs from these simulation images in that it consisted of multiple tails .",
    "secondly , we show simple impulsive emission models in figure  [ fig1 ] ( d)(i ) . in these models",
    ", we assumed the isotropic dust emission of 1   and 10-particles with different velocities ejected on 2010 december 3 .",
    "we adopted the ejection day based on the previous studies ; the dust emission should have occurred on 2010 december 3.5@xmath21.0 @xcite but before 2010 december 3.4 @xcite .",
    "it may seem at a first glance that there should be dust particles ejected with high terminal velocity ( @xmath5 m / s or higher ) because the rim diameters of models with the terminal velocity of @xmath6 100 m / s look smaller than that of the observed image .",
    "in addition , small grains ( @xmath71 ) should exist because the dust cloud was deflected toward the anti - solar direction by solar radiation pressure . for comparison , assuming the mass density of 1670 kg / m@xmath8 ( equivalent to the mass density of the tagish lake meteorite @xcite ) , the escape velocity from ( 596 ) scheila is 55 m / s .",
    "the estimated terminal velocity is two times faster than the escape velocity .    to reconstruct the observed morphology of the ( 596 ) scheila dust cloud , we considered a new dust emission model , described below .",
    "we assumed that the dust particles were ejected in two different forms from an impact point , i.e. , a conical impact ejecta curtain and a downrange plume , which are commonly observed in oblique impact experiments .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows an example of the laboratory oblique impact experiment .",
    "it was conducted with a two - stage light gas gun at the institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) , japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) .",
    "a 3.2-mm steel sphere was accelerated with the gun in a sabot @xcite to 4.521 km / s , which is typical impact velocity in outer main - belt @xcite .",
    "soon after the impact , the dust particles were ejected as the luminous downrange plume with high speed in the horizontal direction with respect to the local surface .",
    "later , the conical ejecta curtain was grown .",
    "we simplified these forms , as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] ( e ) .",
    "the conical impact ejecta curtain is symmetrical with respect to a vector normal to the asteroid surface ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) with a half - opening angle of @xmath11 .",
    "dust particles are assumed to be ejected between @xmath11-@xmath12 and @xmath11+@xmath12 ( see the shadowed area in figure  [ fig2 ] ( e ) ) .",
    "we modeled the downrange plume as a stretched cone with a central axis ranging from ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) to ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the dust particles ejected with the ejection velocity of @xmath17 would decelerate by the asteroid s gravity and reach the terminal velocity @xmath18 .",
    "we applied the power law function of the ejection velocity of dust particles :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the reference ejection velocity ( m / s ) of the particles radius @xmath21=1@xmath310@xmath22 ( m ) , @xmath23 is the power index of size dependence of the ejection velocity , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mass and radius of ( 596 ) scheila .",
    "we considered the energy conservation for the terminal velocity @xmath18 in the second equation of eq .",
    "an power - law size distribution with index @xmath26 was used .",
    "the number of dust particles within a size range of @xmath21 and @xmath21+@xmath27 is given by :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the maximum and minimum particle sizes , respectively , and @xmath31 represents the reference dust production rate .",
    "we fixed @xmath30=0.1   and @xmath26=-3.5 ( discuss later ) , because particles much smaller than the wavelength are inefficient scatterers in the optical wavelength .",
    "the size distribution exponent was also fixed to @xmath26=-3.5 @xcite .",
    "the maximum size @xmath29 can be derived when the size - dependent velocity @xmath17 becomes equal to the escape velocity from ( 596 ) scheila .",
    "the trajectories of the particles were computed from the terminal velocity and the ratio of the force exerted by the solar radiation pressure and the solar gravity ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath32=@xmath33 , where @xmath34 = 5.7@xmath310@xmath35 kg m@xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the radiation pressure coefficient averaged over the solar spectrum @xcite .",
    "we assumed @xmath37=1 .",
    "@xmath38 denotes the mass density of dust particles .",
    "we supposed that the mass densities of the dust particles was 1670 kg / m@xmath8 .",
    "the model images were reconstructed using the monte carlo approach for the parameters above @xcite .",
    "we calculated the positions of dust particles at a given time by solving the keplerian equation .",
    "we considered the impulsive dust emission on 2010 december 3 as stated above .",
    "the free parameters of our model are listed in table 1 .",
    "multiple simulations are carried out using various parameter sets , and the resulting model images are then visually compared to the data to find plausible model parameters . as the result , we obtained the best - fit values .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows some example results for the conical ejecta curtain .",
    "first , we noticed that the southern tail and westward tail ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) could be reproduced by a conical ejecta curtain given a half - opening angle of  50  .",
    "our observations were consistent with the case in which the central axis at ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) of the downrange was ( 90 , -15 ) in the j2000 coordinate system . similarly , we examined the dependence of the downrange plume ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) on the central axis .",
    "we notice the integral along the great circle joining from ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) = ( 150 , + 40 ) to ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) = ( 180 , + 50 ) matches the observed image .",
    "as @xmath11 increased , the opening angle of the ejecta became broader ; as @xmath20 increased , the dust cloud extended more widely .",
    "accordingly , these two variables , @xmath11 and @xmath20 , were well determined by comparison to the observed images .",
    "we estimated @xmath11=15   ( the downrange plume ) , @xmath11=50   and @xmath41=10  ( the conical curtain ) .",
    "we derived @xmath20 = 190",
    "m / s ( the downrange plume ) and @xmath20 = 80 m / s ( the conical curtain ) , suggesting that the maximum speed was 340 m / s ( the downrange plume ) and 140 m / s ( the conical curtain ) for 0.1-   particles .",
    "as @xmath23 decreases , the near - nuclear dust cloud becomes brighter .",
    "the images we captured were consistent with the simulation images for a value of @xmath42 . by combining the conical ejecta curtain and the downrange plume models",
    ", we obtained the best - fit image ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "note that we succeeded in the reproduction of the triple tails by single impact model based on the idea that is commonly observed in oblique impact experiments .    as we mentioned above we fixed two variables : @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "if there are a large amount of small particles in the dust cloud , it should look bluer by rayleigh scattering . as we noticed in @xcite",
    ", no significant difference appears in the morphology observed in three different optical channels .",
    "the observational evidence implies that the diffuse cloud consisted of dust particles large enough to scatter optical light ( i.e. , 2@xmath43 @xmath44 1 , where @xmath45 denotes the optical wavelength ) . the size distribution exponent q=-3.5 was applied because it is the typical to impact fragment @xcite .",
    "we performed the fitting with @xmath26=-4 and @xmath26=-3 , but could not obtain the plausible result .",
    "therefore , the initial assumptions of @xmath26 = -3.5 and @xmath30=0.1   seems to be reasonable .    in the laboratory experiments , the central axis of the conical curtain is usually perpendicular to the local surface .",
    "the downrange plume appears along the trajectory axis of the impactor .",
    "therefore , we can derive the impactor s trajectory if the impact angle with respect to the local surface is known .",
    "the most probable impact angle on arbitrary planetary body is 45@xcite .",
    "if an impact angle of 45   is assumed , it is likely that a small asteroid collided with ( 596 ) scheila from the direction of ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) = ( 60  , -40  ) .",
    "this result suggests that the impactor collided with ( 596 ) scheila from behind .",
    "the angle between the central axis of the conical curtain and that of the downrange plume in the best - fit model is 85 , which is potential value based on the impact experiments ( figure 2(b ) in this paper and figure 19 of @xcite ) .",
    "the derived half - opening angle of 50   is consistent with the results obtained for the rocky ejecta with velocity from hundreds to thousands m / s through the laboratory measurement @xcite .",
    "the power index of size dependence of the ejecta velocity ( @xmath42 ) is smaller than that of comets ( i.e. @xmath46 , typical of hydrodynamical gas drag ) but within the range of the laboratory impact experiments @xcite .",
    "our model predicts that up to 140   particles could escape from ( 596 ) scheila .",
    "in fact , 100   particles were found in the observed images after 2011 february @xcite .",
    "the velocity of dust particles depends on the tensile strength of the surface materials when the impact process is dominated by the material strength rather than gravity .",
    "the maximum ejecta velocity for solid and porous targets measured in the laboratory exceeds 10@xmath3 @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the tensile strength and @xmath49 is the target density ( in figure 18 of @xcite and references therein ) , i.e. , @xmath50 . since the maximum ejecta velocity is 140 m / s for the conical ejecta",
    ", @xmath51 @xmath52 0.3 mpa .",
    "our result on the ejecta velocity suggest that the surface on ( 596 ) scheila was covered by materials with low tensile strength .",
    "so far we have outlined a plausible explanation for the peculiar dust cloud of ( 596 ) scheila .",
    "we constructed a model of the morphology based on experiments of high velocity impacts .",
    "the values of the parameters were free and obtained from fitting the observed image on 2011 december 12 .",
    "we found that the morphologies on 2011 december 17 and 19 @xcite were also reproduced with the same model parameters . in summary",
    ", we find that :    1 .",
    "the morphology of ( 596 ) scheila can be reproduced by an impact - driven ejecta plume consisting of an impact cone and downrange plume .",
    "the maximum ejection velocity of the dust particles exceeded 100 m / s .",
    "3 .   assuming that an impact angle of 45 , the impactor collided with ( 596 ) scheila from the direction of ( 60 , -40 ) in j2000 coordinates .",
