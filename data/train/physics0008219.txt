    "in this paper we develop a simple quantitative method to describe flows with a free surface which can undergo large distortions .",
    "our method is capable of handling flows whose velocity profile may become far from parabolic  even including separation and regions of reverse flow .",
    "we are concerned with the case when the fluid layer is thin . for low reynolds number flows the lubrication approximation can be used with great success ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for high reynolds number flows without separation an inviscid approximation and the shallow water equations @xcite",
    "are widely used . for",
    "moderate reynolds numbers where these limiting approximations are invalid it is important to take both inertial and viscous effects into account in a consistent way , and yet one would like to keep the model simple enough to be tractable . in this paper",
    "we show that integral methods , like the ones developed by von karman , can handle a class of such problems successfully . to be concrete we develop the method in the context of two physical examples : the _ circular hydraulic jump _ and the _ flow down an inclined plane_. both geometries support jump- or kink - like solutions with abrupt changes in the surface shape and internal velocity profiles .",
    "analytical solutions for such flows are extremely difficult to obtain , and simple approximate theories that capture the phenomena are invaluable .",
    "the two flows are studied in separate sections , and an introduction is provided in the beginning of secs .  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "2 we develop the theory for the circular hydraulic jump .",
    "we first study the boundary layer approximation to the full navier - stokes equations , and reduce it to a simple set of equations by averaging over the thickness .",
    "stationary solutions are obtained by solving a two - point boundary value problem for a system of only two ordinary differential equations .",
    "the solution is compared to previous experiments , showing good agreement .",
    "taking advantage of the simplicity of the reduced equations , it is possible to obtain analytic approximations for the stationary solution .",
    "two `` outer '' solutions connected by an `` inner '' transition region are studied separately and we obtain a relationship analogous to the shock condition in the classical shock theory , but within our viscous model .",
    "the flow down an inclined plane is then studied in sec .",
    "we use the same strategy as in sec .  2 to derive a simple model for the two - dimensional flow .",
    "one family of solutions found in this model is kink - like traveling wave solutions that occur , e.g. , when the flow rate is suddenly changed .",
    "their velocity profiles along the inclined plane are found to stay close to parabolic even when a variable profile is assumed .",
    "there is another family of solutions with a sudden change in the surface that would correspond to the circular hydraulic jump in case of the radial geometry .",
    "these solutions can be interpreted as the stationary hydraulic jump , created behind a sluice gate in a river , even though turbulence is not included in the model .",
    "the flow downstream of the jump approaches a simple stationary flow , but the flow upstream is an expanding flow with a linear growth in thickness .",
    "the velocity profile departs considerably from parabolic near the jump .",
    "it is not easy to analyze the stability of the solutions with jumps obtained in secs .  2 and 3 , even in the linear geometry . instead , in sec",
    ", we include time - dependence in the models and study the dispersion relation for the stationary flow with constant thickness .",
    "a well - established concept in the inviscid theory is to classify flows as super- and subcritical when the thickness is small and large , respectively .",
    "they do not have obvious counterparts , however , when viscosity is included . by looking carefully at the dispersion relation in the long and medium wave regime",
    ", we can classify the stationary flows into these two categories in our viscous model .",
    "the model shows spurious divergencies in the short wavelength region which we do not know how to overcome at present .",
    "this makes the model unsuited for direct time - dependent simulations .",
    "a short paper describing some of the main results has appeared earlier @xcite .",
    "when a jet of fluid hits a flat horizontal surface , the fluid spreads out radially in a thin , rapidly flowing layer . at a certain distance from the jet a sudden thickening of the flow takes place , which is called the circular hydraulic jump .",
    "this is commonly seen , e.g. , in the kitchen sink , but it is also important as a coating flow and in jet - cooling of a heated surface @xcite . in these practical flows with typically high reynolds numbers , disturbances often make the jump non - stationary and distorted . in controlled laboratory experiments corresponding to a more moderate reynolds number , an apparently stationary ,",
    "radially - symmetric flow can be achieved .",
    "such experiments was carried out by c.  ellegaard _ et al . _ and",
    "the results have been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we thank them for providing us with data and pictures . a schematic view and a video image of the circular jump",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ expsetup ] .    in these experiments",
    "the hydraulic jump is formed on a flat disc with a circular rim .",
    "the rim height @xmath0 can be varied , and is an important control parameter .",
    "since the rim is located far from the impinging jet with the diameter of the disc around 36 cm , it does not affect the jump except that it changes the height of the fluid layer @xmath1 exterior to the jump .",
    "the jump still forms even when @xmath2 , but a larger @xmath0 makes @xmath1 larger and , therefore , the jump stronger .",
    "typically , @xmath1 exceeds @xmath0 by 1 - 2 mm .",
    "the surface profiles for varying @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ series4 ] .",
    "an interesting transition in the flow structure has been observed @xcite as @xmath0 is varied . for @xmath2 ,",
    "it was noticed before @xcite that the jump contains an eddy on the bottom , called a _ separation bubble _ , whose inner edge is located very close to the position of the abrupt change on the surface , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ type1 - 2](a ) .",
    "such a hydraulic jump is referred to as a _ type i _ jump . while @xmath0 remains small , this jump is stable , but as @xmath0 is increased further , a _ wave - breaking _ transition occurs @xcite which results in a new state of the flow . in this _ type ii _ state , the flow has an additional eddy , called a _ roller _ or a _ surfing wave _ , just under the surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ type1 - 2](b ) . is increased even further , the jump `` closes '' as seen in fig .",
    "[ series4 ] . ]",
    "this state resembles a broken wave in the ocean , but is still apparently laminar . on reducing @xmath0 , the type i pattern reappears , and there is almost no hysteresis associated with this transition .",
    "the transition from type i to ii often leads also to breaking of the radial symmetry .",
    "an intriguing set of polygonal jumps @xcite are created rather than the circular one . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the type i flow which already poses considerable difficulties .",
    "we hope to be able to generalize our approach in the future to be able to handle the transition to the type ii flow .",
    "considering how simple and common the circular hydraulic jump appears to be , it is surprising that a satisfactory systematic theory does not exist .",
    "the approach considered as `` the standard '' for the study of hydraulic jumps is to combine the inviscid shallow water equation with rayleigh s shocks @xcite . in the beginning of",
    "the century lord rayleigh treated @xcite a discontinuity in a one - dimensional linear flow geometry .",
    "such a structure is usually called a _",
    "river bore _ if it is moving and a _ hydraulic jump _ if it is stationary and is created due to , e.g. , variations in the river bed .",
    "his approach was based upon the analogy between the shallow water theory and gas theory @xcite .",
    "he assumed that , across such a shock , the mass and momentum flux are conserved but not the energy flux .    in a coordinate system moving with the shock , the flow velocity @xmath3 and height @xmath4 upstream of the jump as well as @xmath5 and @xmath6 downstream of the jump",
    "are taken to be positive constant values .",
    "then , conservation of mass flux @xmath7 across the jump is given by @xmath8 conservation of momentum flux is @xmath9 these shock conditions lead to the relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the _ upstream froude number _ , @xmath12 the _ downstream froude number _ , and @xmath13 is called the critical height .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath14 is always between @xmath4 and @xmath6 , and that @xmath15 if @xmath16 , and @xmath17 if @xmath18 . in other words",
    "the jump connects a _ supercritical flow _ with @xmath19 on the shallower side ( @xmath20 ) to a _ subcritical flow _ with @xmath21 on the deeper side ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "since the froude number measures the ratio of the fluid velocity @xmath23 and the velocity of linear surface waves @xmath24 , it means that , in the moving frame , the flow moves more rapidly than the surface waves on the shallower side , but moves slower on the deeper side  in a precise analogy with the gas theory @xcite .",
    "further , it is found that the upstream @xmath4 must be supercritical by considering the change in the energy flux across the jump @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the energy flux .",
    "since the energy must be dissipated through the jump , i.e.  @xmath27 , rather than generated , it is required that @xmath28 .",
    "the origin of the dissipation is usually attributed to the turbulent motions at the discontinuity and surface waves carrying energy away from it .",
    "it is possible to apply this theory , combined with an assumption of the potential flow , for describing the circular hydraulic jump .",
    "however , it leads to incorrect estimates @xcite of the radius of the jump @xmath29 .",
    "most notably , @xmath29 is predicted to be sensitive to the radius of the impinging jet which should be greatly influenced by radius and height of the inlet nozzle where liquid comes out . in experiments",
    "@xcite such a strong tendency was not observed .",
    "instead , it has been found that @xmath29 scales with the flow rate @xmath7 with a certain power , and it supports a model in which viscosity plays an important role .",
    "watson @xcite constructed a model of the flow consisting of the inviscid and viscid regimes , and solved the viscid part assuming a similarity profile . by connecting to the specified external height @xmath1 via a rayleigh shock",
    ", he obtained a prediction for the radius of the jump which compares favorably with the measurement @xcite , as we explain in sec .  2.5 . in his model",
    "the viscous layer starts from the stagnation point at @xmath30 on the plate and quickly reaches the surface at a small @xmath31 .",
    "there is a fairly long stretch from this @xmath31 to @xmath29 in which the flow is fully viscous .",
    "thus , one could neglect the inviscid region and assume a fully viscid flow everywhere in order to derive a simpler model .",
    "this assumption was made by kurihara @xcite and tani @xcite who started from the boundary layer equations developed by prandtl @xcite .",
    "they took an average of the equations over the thickness , assuming also a similarity velocity profile .",
    "it resulted in a single ordinary differential equation for the stationary jump .",
    "this theory was elaborated in @xcite who realized that the flow outside the jump would naturally lead to a singularity at a large @xmath31 . by identifying this singularity with the outflow over the rim of the plate ,",
    "the flow outside the jump could be uniquely specified . by introducing a rayleigh shock ,",
    "the jump radius and its parameter dependence was calculated and compared to measurements .",
    "the model predicted the observed @xmath29 reasonably well , as we review in secs .",
    "2.22.5 .    obviously , treating the jump as a discontinuity provides us with no information on the internal structure of the jump region such as the type i to ii transition of the flow patterns .",
    "it also seems inconsistent to assume a rayleigh shock when viscous loss occurs in the whole domain .",
    "why do we assume an extra energy loss at the `` jump '' where the flow is stationary and apparently laminar ?",
    "it seems possible to attribute the energy dissipation entirely to laminar viscous forces , and to construct a viscous theory which produces a smooth but kink - like surface shape without the need for a discontinuity .",
    "nevertheless , such a description must overcome a difficulty arising from the goldstein - type singularity @xcite of the boundary layer equations in the vicinity of separation points .",
    "this singularity is thought to be an artificial one created by truncation of higher derivatives from the navier - stokes equations .",
    "it also arises in the `` usual '' boundary layer situation where a high reynolds number flow passes a body , e.g. , a wing .",
    "in such cases inviscid - viscid interaction is taken into account in order to resolve the singularity in a technique called the inverse method @xcite .",
    "in our situation , however , there is no inviscid flow outside the layer . in secs .",
    "2.62.7 we propose a way to resolve the trouble in the following manner .",
    "we first include an additional degree of freedom in the velocity profile to make it non - self - similar , just like in the karman - pohlhausen method @xcite for the usual boundary layer theory .",
    "to describe the evolution , in @xmath31 , of this free parameter , we couple the layer thickness to the pressure by assuming hydrostatic pressure .",
    "this serves as an alternative to the inverse method in the absence of a potential external flow .",
    "the resulting model for a stationary solution is two coupled ordinary differential equations , and reproduces the type i flow with a separation bubble  the one shown in fig .",
    "[ type1 - 2](a ) .",
    "comparison with the experiment is made in sec .",
    "it is possible to approximate analytically the stationary solution found in the model . in sec .",
    "2.8 the analysis is presented separately for the regions before and after the jump",
    "( i.e.  two `` outer '' solutions ) and the `` inner '' solution inside the jump region . an interesting observation on the inner solution is that a formal parameter @xmath32 can be introduced so that rayleigh s shock condition is recovered in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "we write down the complete model to describe the circular hydraulic jump under the assumption that the flow is laminar and radially symmetric without any angular velocity component .",
    "we take the radial and vertical coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and denote the velocity components by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the governing equations are the continuity equation @xmath38 and the navier - stokes equations : @xmath39 where subscripts denote partial differentiations such as @xmath40 .",
    "for the boundary conditions we impose no - slip on the bottom : @xmath41 the dynamic boundary conditions on the free surface @xmath42 are @xmath43 \\right|_{\\tilde{z}=\\tilde{h } }       = \\sigma \\tilde{k } \\\\",

    "we also need to satisfy the kinematic boundary condition on the free surface : @xmath46 we are mostly interested in stationary solutions in this section .",
    "when the flow is stationary , we may integrate ( [ dimincompr ] ) over @xmath35 from 0 to @xmath47 , and use ( [ kinematicbcdim ] ) to obtain @xmath48 this quantity , the total mass flux @xmath7 or the mass flux per angle @xmath49 , is a constant , given as a parameter in the experiment .      since it is a formidable task to treat the full model as it stands , some simplifications need to be made . as explained in sec .  1 , the reynolds number for the flow of the circular hydraulic jump is too large to justify the lubrication approximation , but is not large enough to use the inviscid approximation .",
    "fortunately , the flow is `` thin , '' i.e.  runs predominantly horizontally along the plate .",
    "truncation of the full model by the boundary layer approximation is quite natural in such a situation , and has indeed been used in previous literature @xcite . in the boundary layer approximation pressure ,",
    "viscous , and inertial terms in ( [ dimns ] ) are all assumed to be of the same order , but there are only a few dominant terms in each group .",
    "for instance , a viscous term @xmath50 is assumed to be negligible compared to @xmath51 .",
    "the dominant terms in the first equation in ( [ dimns ] ) are determined in the usual manner : @xmath52 ( if time - dependent ) , inertia terms @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the pressure term @xmath55 , and the dominant viscous term @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , from the second equation in ( [ dimns ] ) we assume the dominant balance between @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here , unlike the usual boundary layer theory , we have taken into account the effect of gravity .",
    "this will couple the surface height @xmath58 to the pressure , and will later turn out to be crucial for removing the singularities of the boundary layer approximation .",
    "if we denote the characteristic radius and height by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , then the second dominant balance requires the characteristic pressure to be @xmath61 .",

    "also , the predicted scaling can be experimentally tested by , for instance , measuring the dependence of the jump radius by changing the parameters such as @xmath49 . in @xcite evidence of the scaling and validity of the underlying assumption was given .",

    "this is supplemented by the dimensionless continuity equation : @xmath91 and mass flux condition : @xmath92 the boundary conditions have been reduced to : @xmath93 in addition to these conditions , boundary conditions in the radial direction also need to be specified .",
    "we do not elaborate on them , however , since the in- and outlet conditions arise naturally without the need for prescription when we obtain a simplified system .",
    "the boundary layer equations ( [ rescblrad])([rescbc ] ) form a closed system and can be solved numerically , but pose a difficulty when separated regions exist .",
    "suppose that there is a separation point at @xmath94 and @xmath95 on a flat plate where the skin friction @xmath96 vanishes .",
    "in its vicinity one finds @xcite that generic solutions of ( [ rescblrad ] ) develop singularities of the goldstein - type @xmath97 , @xmath98 . on the other hand , experiments @xcite show separation and reversed flow just behind a jump , so it is necessary to overcome this difficulty , which is well - known in the `` usual '' boundary layers around a body immersed in a high reynolds number external flow .",
    "no such singularities are observed in numerics of the full navier - stokes equations in that case , and thus the trouble is thought to be due to truncation of the terms involving higher derivatives in @xmath31 , i.e.  the terms in ( [ nondimns ] ) of the order @xmath80 and higher .",
    "an attempt to include those terms leads to intractable equations , so the inverse method @xcite is often used . in this method the feedback from the boundary layer into the external potential flow is taken into account , and the coupled system is iteratively solved to remove the singularity .",
    "without such an external flow present for the circular hydraulic jump , higuera @xcite has still obtained the velocity and height profiles from the boundary layer equations .",
    "his method , called marginal separation , is to force the boundary layer equations through the point of separation by choosing a special non - divergent velocity profile at the point .",
    "the physical reasoning for the choice of such a particular profile is rather unclear . since our aim is also to obtain a simple tractable model , we have chosen a different approach .      rather than solving the partial differential equation ( [ rescblrad ] ) itself , we shall be content with satisfying only the mass and momentum conservation laws , derived from averaging ( [ rescblrad ] ) over the transverse @xmath99-direction . to do this",
    "we make an ansatz for the radial velocity profile @xmath100 .",
    "one might expect that the singularities at separation points do not contribute to the averages and do not cause any harm .",

    ", the velocity @xmath23 should be large for small @xmath31 , and decrease smoothly as @xmath31 increases .",

    "therefore , one must still connect solutions in the interior and the exterior by means of , e.g. , a rayleigh shock across which mass and momentum flux are conserved .",
    "when this is carried out , one finds that the shock occurs very close to @xmath124 in the dimensionless coordinates , implying that the radius of the jump in the dimensional coordinates scales roughly as @xmath59 in ( [ nondimrescaling ] ) , i.e. : @xmath125 this scaling relation ( [ jumpscale ] ) was compared to experiments @xcite by changing @xmath49 for several different @xmath126 .",
    "the radius of the jump indeed scaled with the mass flux @xmath49 , but the exponent observed in the experiment was about 3/4 rather than 5/8 suggested by ( [ jumpscale ] ) . to explain the discrepancy , @xmath29 was calculated more accurately @xcite .",
    "it was first proven that there is no solution for @xmath119 to the kurihara - tani equation that extends to @xmath127 .",

    ", one may always find the solution of ( [ tanieqv ] ) diverging at the end of the plate of a given radius @xmath128 . by following the solution to smaller @xmath31 , the solution before the jump and the position of the shock are uniquely determined assuming a connection via a rayleigh shock .",
    "the shock location constructed in this way showed a good agreement @xcite with the experiment .",
    "an ansatz more flexible than ( [ similarityprofile ] ) must be used for resolving the flow pattern in the vicinity of the jump .",
    "we shall allow the function @xmath113 in ( [ similarityprofile ] ) to depend also on @xmath31 .",
    "the simplest modification we can make is to assume @xmath130 so that the velocity profile is characterized by a single `` shape parameter '' @xmath131 . the approach follows the ideas developed by von karman and pohlhausen @xcite for the usual boundary layer flow around a body .",

    "we now come back to the stationary equilibrium flow , and study the dispersion relation in the short wave range . since the derivation of the averaged equations relies on the assumption of predominantly horizontal flow ,",
    "it is not our aim to accurately resolve wave components when @xmath444 is large .",
    "we only hope that the short waves decay so that they do not interfere with meaningful dynamics when we simulate the time - dependent model .",
    "unfortunately , the one - parameter model performs poorly in this respect compared to the similarity model .",
    "the dispersion relation of the similarity model ( [ exactdisp1 ] ) can be approximated in the large @xmath444 limit as @xmath489 thus , short waves in ( [ shkadovmod ] ) are damped out if @xmath490 .",
    "if we neglect the surface tension and set @xmath346 , the dispersion relation for large @xmath444 is @xmath491 where @xmath492 is the velocity of the corresponding wave given by @xmath493 since @xmath494 from ( [ velshortwave1 ] ) , the branch @xmath448 is always stable , as can be seen from ( [ shortwave0 ] ) . on the other hand , since @xmath495 , the condition for the stability of the branch @xmath450 is @xmath496 , which is equivalent to @xmath497 for a large @xmath184 the equilibrium state is no longer stable , but this is reasonable in the absence of surface tension .",
    "now , we turn into the dispersion relation of the one - parameter model ( [ expldisp ] ) . for large @xmath444",
    ", it behaves as @xmath498 and as @xmath499 in either case one of the branches has an unstable component as @xmath500 , irrespective of @xmath184 or @xmath284 .",
    "we have been unable to find a natural modification to the one - parameter model which prevents this unphysical behavior .",
    "its cause may well be that the evolution of short waves is not well represented by the boundary layer approximation we started with .",
    "in fact , in the boundary layer equations ( [ bleqinpl ] ) the higher order derivatives of @xmath303 that are thought to be crucial for stability of the high-@xmath444 modes are neglected . in this view",
    "the similarity model ( [ shkadovmod ] ) provides surprisingly reasonable behaviour for large @xmath444 , even starting from ( [ bleqinpl ] ) .",
    "in this article we have presented a simple but fairly quantitative method of reducing flows with strongly deformed free surfaces to a manageable system of equations . by assuming a `` flexible '' velocity profile whose shape parameter is another dependent variable , flows with an internal eddy can be described . in the radial geometry",
    "our results compare well with experiments and we have obtained analytic expressions for the circular hydraulic jump .    we have also studied the flow down an inclined plane .",
    "the reduced equations possess not only the traveling wave solutions ( heteroclinic orbits ) studied previously but also stationary jump solutions .",
    "we have found that the stationary solutions show a stronger change in the velocity profile than the traveling waves .    finally , we have classified different parts of the flows into super- and subcritical by studying the dispersion relation around the equilibrium flow .",
    "this classification is standard for inviscid shallow water flow and in shock theory , but is is not obvious in the context of viscous flow .",
    "indeed , for sufficiently long waves the averaged equations show that supercritical flow is not possible .",
    "however , waves with intermediate lengths can make the flow essentially supercritical .",
    "the only but serious defect of our reduced model which we have been unable to overcome is its short wavelength behavior .",
    "as it stands now , some artificial dissipation term to stabilize the short waves is necessary before time - dependent simulations are attempted . to our dismay a more natural treatment of this problem",
    "has so far eluded us .",
