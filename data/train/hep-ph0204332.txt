    "the vector and axial coupling constants , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in z - decays have been measured at lep @xcite . in @xcite , various additional types of interactions have been performed and a way to measure these contributions in the process @xmath9 was described .",

    "it was emphasised that the collider limits were not competitive with low energy tests of lorentz violation for bounding the scale of space - time noncommutativity . furthermore",
    ", the renormalizability and the unitarity of nc theories have been studied in the series of works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the explicit expressions for the branching ratios of @xmath0 and @xmath10 in the framework of the ncsm .",

    "the flavor conserving @xmath0 , @xmath3 , decays appear in the tree level in the sm . when the non - commutative effects are switched on there exists a new contribution which is proportional to the a function of the noncommutative parameter @xmath21 .",
    "our starting point is the effective action @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) denotes the moyal - weyl star product ( see eq .",

    "finally , the additional vertex to the @xmath0 decay to the second order in @xmath21 can be obtained as @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) incoming ( ougoing ) four momentum of z boson with polarization vector @xmath43 ( anti - lepton ) .",
    "notice that the part of the vertex proportional with @xmath44 would be the whole contribution in the case that the nc effects enter into the expressions as an exponential factor @xmath45 , which is consistent in approximate phenomenology ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "now we present the br of the process @xmath0 including the non commutative effects at the least order in @xmath21 , in the z boson rest frame : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total decay width of z boson , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",

    "however , it is cancelled by the part , coming from the vertex linear in @xmath21 .    at this stage",

    "this dependence becomes extremely small , @xmath94 , for @xmath95 decay ( see fig .",
