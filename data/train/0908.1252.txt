    "under the assumption of the adiabaticity of the nuclear motion ( the shape variations are slower than the single - particle motion ) , a collective hamiltonian can be defined as the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of deformation @xcite:@xmath0 in this paper we consider only the deformation of the nucleus neglecting thus the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "the set @xmath1 specifies a set of deformation parameters of the nuclear surface .",
    "they constitute the dynamical variables of the motion .",
    "the functions @xmath2 represent the so - called mass parameters or the tensor of inertia , and @xmath3 is the potential energy of deformation .",
    "both of these functions depend on the deformation of the nucleus .",
    "these two quantities are especially important in the study of the dynamic of the nucleus such as the nuclear fission ( lifetime estimates ) @xcite and the collective levels of the nucleus @xcite.usually , the quantity @xmath4 can be evaluated in the framework of the constrained hartree - fock theory or by the phenomenological shell correction method .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath2 are often approximated by the cranking formula @xcite or in the self consistent approaches by other models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the present work focuses mainly on the drawbacks of the numerical aspect of the calculation of the mass parameters on the basis of the cranking formula .",
    "in particular , it is well known that cranking procedure is somewhat delicate and in some cases can even lead to singular unphysical values for the mass parameters .",
    "one of the goals of the present work is precisely to discuss this point and to propose a correction to this formula .",
    "first and foremost , to our point of view , it seems that the main mistake is the presence in the formula of the derivatives of the gap parameter and the fermi level .",
    "therefore , the main part of this work will be devoted to the looking for the arguments ( or proofs ) which could justify the removing of these terms . on the basis of theoretical as well as numerical approaches , this survey will also be very useful to demonstrate the relative importance of the different terms entering into the calculations and also to show how the shell effects affect precisely the mass parameters .",
    "we realize that we criticize an old and well established formula , but it is only `` the bad '' part of the formula which is called into question , not the formula itself .",
    "this `` bad part '' is the main source of the problems of the formula .",

    "are also taken into account in the hamiltonian.since in the hamiltonian the kinetic energy operator does not depend on the deformation and since the deformed average potential is the most important term compared to the spin - orbit and coulomb interactions , the derivative of the single - particle hamiltonian ( appearing in the above cranking formula ) will be approximated by the one of the average potential as in ref.@xcite:@xmath45 @xmath46 denotes the deformed wood - saxon potential . in our work ,",

    "starting from the single - particle spectrum the gap parameters @xmath53 and the fermi level @xmath11 are solved from the bcs equations ( [ bcs1 ] ) and ( [ bcs2 ] ) as soon as the single - particle spectrum @xmath51 is known.@xmath58@xmath59 of course , the deformation dependence of the eigenenergies @xmath60 involves the ones of @xmath53 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , this dependence is not obtained `` straightforwardly '' from the single particle model itself , that is , from the shrodinger equation ( [ schrodinger2 ] ) , but from the bcs equations ( [ bcs1 ] ) and ( [ bcs2 ] ) . from this point of view",
    ", these two quantities ( i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath11 ) must not be linked to the deformation as the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of @xmath16 do.nevertheless , usually they are considered `` explicitly '' deformation dependent through the expression of their derivatives obtained by the so - called lowest - order expansion @xcite , @xcite:@xmath61 with @xmath62 in the following the expression `` the derivatives '' which will be used many times in the text means simply the both derivatives given by eq .",

    "( [ rnu ] ) that it is the derivatives of @xmath53 and @xmath11 which cause the problem . in this respect ,",
    "the formulae ( [ difflamda ] ) and ( [ diffdelta ] ) are subject to a major drawback due to the fact that their common denominator can vanish .",

    "( [ ab ] ) ) and therefore vanishes with it and because on the other hand @xmath75 is defined as a `` random '' sum of postive and negative values ( see again eq . ( [ ab ] ) ) depending on whether the terms are below or above the fermi level . in the literature , this problem has been reported many times @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , but no solution has been proposed .",

    "other studies @xcite neglect the derivatives without any justification .",
    "even if in some cases the derivatives introduce small differences , in others , this is not true at all .",
    "in fact , it is easy to realize that these terms involve serious and insoluble problems . therefore , after intensive numerical calculations , we have led to ask ourselves if their presence could be called into question .",
    "if so , their removal should be justified .",
    "consequently , the problem amounts to find good arguments for that .",
    "this constitutes the first step of this work . without further ado ,",

    "to overcome `` the paradox '' of the previous section , we need to start from an ansatz or assertion which justify the removal of the derivatives of @xmath11 and @xmath53 .  before that , we want to recall some important points .",
    "first , the derivatives of @xmath11 and @xmath53 come from the derivatives of the probabilities in the formula ( [ massparametersbcs1 ] ) .",

    "we have to write @xmath83 instead @xmath84 because the changes of @xmath11 and @xmath53 are determined from the knowledge of the spectrum \\{@xmath81 } which depends itself on the deformation of the nucleus.thus from our `` principle '' the `` virtual change of the probability '' , i.e. @xmath85 , is due to only one level , namely `` the corresponding '' level @xmath81.2 ) it is well known from the bcs  theory that the quantities @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath11 , @xmath53 , are related to each other self - consistently so that the change of @xmath85 would depend on its own change trough @xmath11 and @xmath53 .",

    "this constitutes an illogical consequence . to overcome this problem , we state the following intuitive assertion which avoid such a problem and hence the `` initial '' problem of the derivatives of @xmath11 and @xmath53 . :",
    "`` between two infinitely close ' ' virtual `` deformations @xmath77 and @xmath91 , the quantities @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath11 and @xmath53 must verify the simple ( but not so obvious ) following conditions'':@xmath92 in such a way that eq .",

    "( [ massparametersbcs3 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ massparameters4 ] ) is the absence of the derivatives @xmath103 and @xmath39 in the second version of the formula .",

    "in the present section we will try to prove that the modified or `` corrected '' cranking formula for the mass parameters is consistent with `` reasonable '' results . in this respect ,",
    "we have first looked for a `` critical '' case where there is no bcs solution apart from the trivial solution ( @xmath65 ) and applied then the both formulae .",

    "indeed , first , the diagonal matrix elements are always by far more important than the other because in the integrand the derivative of the potential are multiplied by a squared wave function,@xmath150 whereas for the non - diagonal matrix elements , i.e. , for@xmath151 the two radial wave functions are not always in phase , their product @xmath152 has not a definite sign , the contributions to the integral will have tendency to cancel each other , or at least to lead to a small values.it is clair that the more important coefficients @xmath104 ( diagonal and non diagonal ) are those which are the closest to the fermi level .",

    "for closed levels ( @xmath155 @xmath156 ) , the radial wave functions are often in `` opposite '' phase ( like two `` consecutives '' wave functions of the one dimensional infinite square well ) so that the contribution to the integral will be necessarily very small .",
    "this explains why the diagonal part is dominant.before closing this paragraph , we would like to add an important remark concerning the shell effects .",
    "the latter are of course due to quantum mechanics .",
    "they involve sudden variations in the mass parameters with the number of particles .",
    "they appear when a few states contribute essentially to the mass parameters .",
    "in fact , for the mass parameters , we have a very limited number of diagonal matrix elements which contribute essentially to the mass parameters opposed to an admixture of a large number of small non - diagonal matrix elements .",

    "we have found numerically that when there is not bcs solution the diagonal term ( without derivatives ) is practically equal to zero ( @xmath157 ) so that the mass parameters reduce only to the non - diagonal part of the formula . in this case",
    "the mass parameters are very small . because the values and the fluctuations of the mass parameters are mostly due to the diagonal contribution , our numerical study will concern exclusively this term . in the following ,",
    "once more , we will concentrate obviously on the version of the formula without derivatives .",
    "the `` simple '' diagonal part can be cast under the following form:@xmath158 with,@xmath159 as mentioned before , only few ( about two up to five at all ) energy levels contribute really to the final value of the mass parameters .",
    "indeed , this function is peaked at @xmath11 and due to the power of the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ coeffdiago ] ) decreases very rapidly so that only few levels give important coefficients . for a valid bcs solution ,",
    "a relative weak value of @xmath53 gives significant coefficient @xmath160.for example , we give in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( bottom and top ) the coefficients @xmath160 ( black stars ) and the square of the matrix elements @xmath161 ( black squares ) for the neutron contributions of the same two isotopes as before and the same deformation .",
    "first of course , we especially can check that these coefficients are important near the fermi level ( @xmath144 and @xmath162level ) .",
    "we have thus computed the four major neutron contributions of the energy levels and we have found @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively for @xmath142 and @xmath138 cases . these contributions are not only due to the strongest values of the coefficients @xmath160 but also to the `` corresponding '' matrix elements ( see eq .",
    "( [ diagonalpart])).we also can see very clearly the shell structure of the squared matrix elements which is the same for these two cases ( because the deformation and hence the spectrum are the same in the both cases ) .    ) by the square of the diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath165 ) ( see rel .",
    "( [ diagonalpart ] ) ) ; the arrow indicate the levels which contribute the most to the mass parameters ; for example in the nucleus @xmath107 ( bottom ) we have @xmath166 neutrons .",
    "each level supports two neutrons ; the las filled level is thus the @xmath144 .",
    "therefore the fermi energy is situated between the @xmath144 and the @xmath167 level ; in the vicinity of this energy we see the important values of the coefficients which are represented by stars ; this is essentially due to a crossing level near the fermi energy ( see text ) ; the black squares indicate the values of the corresponding squared matrix elements ; coefficients as well as matrix elements follows their proper shell structure ; thus the mass parameters are governed by a `` dual '' shell structure ( see text ) ; ( top ) analog results for the second isotope @xmath168 with @xmath138 neutrons ; in the latter case , of course , the fermi level will lie between the @xmath162 and the @xmath169 level ; for this case the coefficients are less important.,width=529 ]    an other remark is that the maxima of the matrix elements are situated at the levels n@xmath170 which correspond to the nucleon numbers @xmath171 which are magic or nearly magic , but these numbers are obtained for a weak deformed shape of the nucleus , whereas in the binding energy they match the spherical shape",
    ". moreover these maxima are immediately preceded or followed by small values .",
    "thus the shell structure of the matrix elements appears less regular than the one of the energy levels .",
    "as we can see , the shell structure is `` contained '' not only in the level density but also in the matrix elements .",
    "thus the mass parameters are characterized by a complex `` dual '' shell structure.at last , as a special case , we must point out the very strong values of the coefficients ( i.e. , the stars ) in fig [ fig3]-bottom involving very large the mass parameters at @xmath111 .",
    "this very exceptional situation arises in the so called one crossing levels ( see ref.(@xcite ) and ( @xcite ) ) near the fermi energy .",
    "this will be analyzed in the next subsection .      in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have plotted the energy levels for different values of the deformation parameter @xmath77 ( @xmath172 being fixed to @xmath68 ) .",
    "the bcs fermi level is indicated by a star .",
    "this level is situated in the middle of a gap constituted by the last filled and the first unfilled levels .",
    "as @xmath77 increases , these two levels approach little by little each other . from the first @xmath173 and up to the fourth deformation @xmath174 , the fermi level lies always in the middle of a gap corresponding to the neutrons magic number @xmath142 .     at differents deformation",
    "; for small deformations due to the spherical symmetry there is a high degeneracy ; for this reason it seems that ther are less levels at @xmath149 and approximately for the nearest deformations .",
    "the fermi level is indicated by a star ; due to the neutron magic number @xmath175 it is situated in the center of an important energy gap ( between the @xmath144 and the @xmath167 level ) ; note that the gap reduces gradually as @xmath77 increases from the spherical shape ; for the four first levels there is no bcs solution and the mass parameters are small ; for @xmath111 , we obtain a crossing level which contributes strongly to the mass parameters through the diagonal part ; compare these comments with the results of fig([fig1]-bottom).,width=529 ]    in these locations , the level density is so small with respect to the pairing strength so that it ( i.e. , the level density ) is not able to insure a valid ( non - trivial ) bcs solution . in these four cases",
    "we have thus @xmath176 @xmath118 and hence no valid bcs solution .",
    "therefore , due to the weakness of @xmath53 , the diagonal term of ( [ massparametersbcs3 ] ) does not contribute at all to the mass parameters .",
    "in these situations , the mass parameters are very small ( @xmath177 @xmath178 in our case ) .",
    "however , for the deformation @xmath111 , the two levels become very close to the fermi level .",
    "it occurs in the immediate vicinity of the fermi level a crossing levels .",
    "this happens inside a gap and gives rise to two very strong coefficients .",
    "moreover , the corresponding values of the squared matrix elements are also important , giving practically all the contribution to the mass parameters .",
    "this phenomenon is characteristic of a phase transition ( compare with [ fig1]-bottom ) .",
    "the remaining cases ( @xmath77 beyond @xmath179 ) can be considered as `` normal cases '' .",
    "they correspond to values about @xmath180 .",
    "we have focused our discussion around the mass parameter @xmath124 , but similar studies will lead to analog general conclusions ( seen above ) for the two other mass parameters @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "however , we will make further useful remarks . for the quadrupole deformation @xmath183 , we write the detailed form for the three mass parameters ( naturally , once more without the derivatives):@xmath184 with @xmath104 given by eq .",
    "( [ coeff2]).it is easy to compare these three quantities .",
    "first it is to be noted that they have the same coefficient so that the only difference will come from the matrix elements .",
    "the latter have not a definite sign in such a way that the third mass parameters will be the result of the sum of positive as well as negative terms .",
    "it will be thus necessary smaller than the two first mass parameters for which we have only positive contributions .",
    "moreover , it is found numerically that @xmath124 is generally larger than @xmath185 this can also be easily explained by the fact that the single - particle potential is generally more sensitive to the @xmath77 degree of freedom than the @xmath172 s one , especially for the region the barium isotopes . in other words for the quadrupole deformations and a woods - saxon potential we have ,",
    "@xmath186 although the present work is devoted exclusively to the mass parameters , we would like to add an important remark concerning the moments of inertia . indeed , these quantities can also be evaluated with the help of the cranking approximation including pairing correlations.([momentinertia]):@xmath187 because the latter looks like to the one of the mass parameter ( of course without the derivatives ) , it is tempting to conclude that the behaviour of these two quantities will in principle be the same .",
    "however , it is well known that unlike the mass parameters , the behaviour of the moments of inertia is always found as a smooth function of particle - number .",
    "it depends mainly on the deformation of the nucleus .",
    "this means that contrarily to the mass parameters , there are no shell effects in the moments of inertia . from our previous study",
    ", it is easy to interpret this difference .",
    "first , this is due partly to the lower power of the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ momentinertia ] ) but the main reason is that there is no diagonal contribution ( @xmath99 ) to this sum because the `` coefficient '' vanishes when @xmath99 .",
    "remembering that the shells effects come almost exclusively from the diagonal part of the total contribution , we can conclude here that they will be necessary quasi absent in the moments of inertia .",
    "we have also solved numerically the generalized bohr hamiltonian with the help of the numerical fortran code of  ref .",
    "the six inertial functions have been calculated of course via the two versions of the cranking formula and the potential energy of deformation with the strutinsky method .",
    "the two types of calculation are compared to the experimental levels .",
    "for this task we chose two barium isotopes .",
    "this choice is justified by the fact that the magic nuclei @xmath188 undergoes the phase transition near the spherical shape whereas for the other ( non magic ) nuclei @xmath189 there is not the case .",
    "the formula without derivatives is called as the `` new '' formula whereas the other is called the `` old '' formula .",
    "the experimental low lying collective levels are denoted by `` exp '' . from the figure it is clear that for the phase transition @xmath190 the both formulae give very different results .",
    "the advantage of the new version of the formula is clear because the old version gives a completely absurd result . in the other case",
    "the difference is much more less important but the theoretical `` new '' and `` old '' formulae do not give identical spectra .",
    "the cranking formula of the mass parameters is widely used in the study of the dynamics of the nucleus . however , its applications are not free from ambiguities and contradictions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to convince that these problems are inherent to a spurious presence of the so - called derivatives in the formula .",
    "therefore , by means of a simple `` proved assertion '' based on a number of pertinent arguments ( see text ) , it is simply recommended to remove these derivatives .",
    "it turns out that the cranking formula without derivatives is no more subject to the cited problems and becomes simpler to interpret .",
    "let us re - examine some advantages :    \\i ) the `` new '' formula reduces in a naturally way to that of the unpaired system when @xmath65 whereas the old version leads to an inextricable paradox .",
    "\\ii ) the problem of the unphysical large values of the mass ( singularity ) and thereby unphysical collective spectra disappears .",
    "\\iii ) the shell effects are physically no more `` masked '' or `` perturbed '' by the derivatives .",
    "\\iv ) the formula becomes more transparent and a number a features have been highlighted in this paper .",
    "for example , the shell effects are not only connected to the level density as it is usually claimed , but also to the matrix elements which have also their proper shell structure .",
    "thus , the shell effects appear to be governed by a `` dual '' shell structure . therefore",
    ", examining the mass parameters only through the level density , as it is usually done , is surely insufficient to explain the results .",
    "we hope that this work will help the reader to a better understanding of the mass parameters  and will encourage further investigations in this direction .",
    "the cranking formula for the mass parameters is given by eq .",
    "( [ massparameters ] ) . if we want to apply the cranking formula in the framework of the independent - particle model , we assume that the excited states are simply one particle - one hole excitations .",
    "we proceed to the following replacements :    @xmath191  and  @xmath192  where  @xmath193 is the ground state or the core of the independent - particle model . in this expression , @xmath194 is the `` real '' vacuum and @xmath195 is the creation operator of a real particle in the state @xmath196.in the second quantization formalism , we can write:@xmath197we choose @xmath198 as the eigenfunctions of the single particle hamiltonian @xmath199 .",
    "the @xmath200 are then the associated eigenenergies.the matrix element entering in the cranking formula reads then:@xmath201 @xmath202it is clear that the only non - vanishing matrix elements imply that : @xmath203 and @xmath204.@xmath205 @xmath206 for @xmath207 and @xmath208 . with @xmath209.assuming that in the independent - particle model the energy of the nucleus amounts simply to the one of its nucleons we will have @xmath210 @xmath18 , therefore the cranking formula becomes:@xmath211",
