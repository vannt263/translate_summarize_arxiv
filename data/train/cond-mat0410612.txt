    "the sand piles and flux hills in superconductors demonstrate many features typical for the self - organized critical state .",
    "several different models were suggested to illustrate and study dynamical systems with extended spatial degrees of freedom and many metastable states .",
    "these systems evolve into a _ self - organized _ critical state without a detailed specification of the initial conditions , i.e. , the critical state is an attractor of their dynamics which is robust with respect to variations of parameters and the presence of quenched randomness .",
    "we consider now a specific subclass of _ extremal _ processes demonstrating the self - organized criticality . in extremal models at each step only the sites satisfying a certain extremal criterion are involved into the system dynamics . in particular , the problem of low - temperature flux creep in superconductors can be mapped to the robin hood type extremal model@xcite .",

    "he takes nothing to himself so that overall amount of goods on the market is conserved .",
    "the market reaches a critical state after some transition time .",
    "many physical systems with a dynamical variable matching a certain conservation relation can be treated in the framework of the robin hood model . in particular , the low - temperature flux creep , motion of dislocations through a random array of point obstacles , domain walls in ferromagnets , grain boundaries in polycrystals , _ etc _ , can be mapped to this type of extremal processes@xcite .",
    "we will use the robin hood type model to treat the self - criticality of the low - temperature flux creep in superconductors in detail .      if the temperature is very low than vortices in sites with even slightly different current density have strongly different probability of depinning .",
    "therefore , the depinning of vortices will happen first in the place with the highest current density .",
    "the model suggested by zaitsev @xcite simulates a part of a superconductor with @xmath49 sites using the closed boundary conditions .",
    "numbers @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) describe the values of the current density @xmath22 along the @xmath52-axis ( the current flows along the @xmath53-axis ) .",
    "at each simulation step a site number @xmath54 with the maximal current density @xmath55 is found ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_02 ] ) .",
    "this current density is reduced by @xmath56 chosen from a uniform distribution @xmath57 @xmath58 it is worth mentioning that zaitsev s model conserves the total current @xmath59 which means that the average value of the critical current density @xmath60 is also conserved .",
    "the system approaches the critical state starting from any initial state with a given value of @xmath60 . in this critical state",
    "almost all sites have current densities less than a certain value @xmath24 .",
    "each site of the system maps an area in a superconductor containing a large amount of vortices but depinning is referred to a single vortex .",
    "motion of this vortex leads to a rearrangement of a cluster of correlated vortices and changes the local current density by some value which is determined by the uniform distribution @xmath57 .",
    "the distribution of the values of @xmath56 which will be referred below as @xmath56-distribution , defines the number of vortices participating in an avalanche starting from a depinning of a single vortex , or , to be more precise , it is related to the number of vortices leaving a given site as a result of an avalanche . at sufficiently low temperature",
    "this vortex rearrangement is a very fast process comparing to the thermally activated depinning .",
    "therefore , all the details concerning these avalanches , including microscopic vortex dynamics , are  hidden \" in @xmath56-distribution .",
    "the fact that the flux creep dynamics conserves the total current @xmath61 leads to a high level of correlation between the sites . in the extremal models the extremal sites",
    "are located according to some problem - specific criterion and they provoke changes of the neighbor sites , again , according to rules specific for a given model .",
    "we will call these sites _ ignition _ sites .",

    "a system in a critical state is characterized by a critical value of the dynamical parameter . in particular , for the flux creep model this parameter is @xmath24 which is the least value of @xmath22 in the ignition sites .",
