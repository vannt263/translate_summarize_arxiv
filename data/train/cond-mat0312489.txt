    "as is well known , financial time series present a strongly inhomogeneous time behavior .",
    "this is specially true when one considers either the volatility or the activity , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of transactions per unit of time . indeed if we look at the variance of the return in a time window of , say , one day , we will observe periods of relative constant and regular behavior followed by other periods of strong variation of the price . in the same way there are days with few transactions and others where the number of trades is considerably larger .",
    "this great variability in the volatility or in the activity is generally referred to as volatility clustering or intermittency of volatility and activity . in this work",
    "we refer to both quantities",
    ". we will thus perform measures on the activity and use two volatility models : ( i ) arch models @xcite and ( ii ) stochastic volatility ( sv ) models  @xcite , where the relationship between volatility and activity is set by the usual assumption of proportionality between them @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the time interval or distance between two consecutive transactions @xmath0 is a random variable described by a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath1 which in many cases presents an asymptotic power law of the form@xcite @xmath2 however @xmath1 does not tell anything about the independence of consecutive @xmath0 s .",
    "we note that if consecutive @xmath0 s are independent a power law tail in @xmath1 can explain an inhomogeneous behavior in the number of events per unit of time , where a possible measure of this inhomogeneity is the distribution of the number of trades in a fixed period of time @xmath3 . as feller proved many years ago @xcite ,",
    "if the time interval @xmath0 between some particular events , which we will call markers , in a time series is distributed according to a given density @xmath1 and the independence condition @xmath4 for @xmath5 holds , then the probability distribution to observe a fixed number of these markers @xmath6 in a given time interval , @xmath7 , follows a scaling law of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is some positive exponent and @xmath10 is a positive and integrable function . with the help of a recently developed technique for the analysis of time series called diffusion entropy ( de ) @xcite",
    ", we will see that the scaling observed in the distribution of the number of transactions in a time interval does not correspond to feller s analytical prescription obtained with the density @xmath1 estimated from data .",
    "we are thus forced to make the additional hypothesis that consecutive @xmath0 s are not independent .",
    "we will also assume that this correlation is due to the presence of peaks ( or clusters ) in the mean activity followed by periods of relative calm .",
    "therefore the @xmath11 s are positively correlated because during a peak of activity they are shorter than the mean value while away from a peak they are greater than the mean .",
    "indeed , in such a case @xmath12 which implies a positive correlation : @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the random time distance between two consecutive peaks and denote by @xmath15 its probability density function .",
    "similarly to the distribution of the distance between two consecutive transactions @xmath1 , we will also assume that @xmath15 obeys an asymptotic power law : @xmath16 in this scheme the results of the de technique can be described directly in terms of the time distance and the magnitude of the peaks of activity , the latter described by a pdf @xmath17 .",
    "we will see , like in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the distribution of the size of the cluster given by @xmath17 does not play an important role , because the time distance distribution @xmath15 is characterized by a more anomalous exponent than @xmath17 .",
    "consequently we will interpret the results of de as a consequence of a non - poissonian distribution of the distance between peaks of activity .",
    "there are in the literature several approaches that try to explain the autocorrelation of activity and volatility .",
    "one recent model @xcite is based on the hypothesis that the intermittency of activity is caused by a subordination to a random walk , like in the case of the so called on - off intermittency @xcite .",
    "as clearly described in @xcite , this procedure should give for the distribution of distances between clusters a scaling law of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a cutoff function ensuring the existence of the first moment of @xmath15 and @xmath20 is the time scale at which this cutoff takes place .",
    "one simple choice for @xmath19 is given by the exponential @xmath21 which allows that @xmath15 presents an asymptotic poissonian behavior .",
    "as we have already mentioned , other possible approaches to the problem of activity correlation are provided by arch models or sv models .",
    "we will show that both , arch and sv , models lead to a correlation in the volatility which more likely resembles to a power law tail exponent observed in a variety of financial markets .",
    "we will also show that a particular arch model , the tarch model presented in @xcite , and the sv model presented in @xcite both result in the same scaling law than that observed with the de technique . finally , and due to the absence of intra - day disturbances in the time series obtained by arch and sv models , we are also able to evaluate numerically the waiting time distribution @xmath15 of the distance between peaks and this distribution is compatible with the empirical evidence given by a power - law behavior for a ( long ) transient period followed by a poissonian ( exponential ) behavior .",
    "we incidentally note that this asymptotic exponential behavior indicates that very far clusters do not influence each other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a brief review on the de technique and a simple analytical proof that the de results are determined by the most anomalous power law tail between @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "after that we show the results obtained by means of the de technique on tick by tick data of a foreign exchange ( fx ) market .",
    "we also perform a filtering procedure on data in order to prove that the observed scaling is due to the anomaly in the waiting time pdf @xmath15 and not in the cluster size pdf @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we briefly describe the arch and the sv models and the results of the de and the waiting time distribution on the time series constructed using these models .",
    "the diffusion entropy technique is basically an algorithm designed to detect memory in time series @xcite .",
    "de is specially suitable for intermittent signals , _",
    "i.e. , _ for time series where bursts of activity are separated by periods of quiescent and regular behavior .",
    "the technique has been designed to study the time distribution of some markers ( or events ) along the time series and thus discover whether these events satisfy the independence condition @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) where @xmath22 is the time interval between the marker labeled @xmath23 and the next one @xmath24 @xcite . as marker",
    "we use here a very simple definition : _ each trade in the time series is a marker_. in order to apply the de technique we need to construct a new series @xmath25 which is a function of a coarse grained time @xmath26 ( in our case @xmath27 s ) and where @xmath25 is precisely the number of transactions that occurred in the previous second .",
    "we next define a new random process through the following moving counting on @xmath25 @xmath28 note that @xmath29 is precisely the number of markers ( _ i.e. , _ trades ) in an interval of length @xmath3 starting at position @xmath30 .",
    "if we vary the value of @xmath30 along the interval @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is the total length of the sequence , we can obtain the probability density function , @xmath7 , of this random process .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for the zero - mean process @xmath33 and assuming that @xmath25 is a renewal process , then @xmath7 obeys the scaling law given by eq .",
    "( [ scalinglaw ] ) .",
    "hence , the entropy of this random process reads @xcite @xmath34 { \\rm d}y = a + \\delta \\ln(t ) .",

    "the fit gives @xmath37 .",
    "as is shown in @xcite if condition @xmath38 holds then there exists a relation between the scaling exponent @xmath9 and the exponent @xmath39 of the power law tail of the time distribution of markers ( in our case , trades ) @xmath1 ( see eq .",

    "( [ powerlaw ] ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath47 .",
    "we also assume that the intensity of a given peak , @xmath48 , defined as the total number of transactions in the peak , has a distribution given by a pdf @xmath17 . in the context of earthquakes @xmath17",
    "is generally referred to as the pareto law of the size of the earthquake clusters , since asymptotically @xmath49 as in the usual pareto distribution @xcite .",
    "we will now present a proof that the de technique perceives the most anomalous ( _ i.e. _ , the smallest ) of the two exponents @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath52 be the joint pdf for the waiting time @xmath14 between clusters and their intensity @xmath53 .",
    "we denote by @xmath54 its fourier - laplace transform .",
    "observe that in terms of @xmath55 the laplace transform of the waiting time distribution @xmath56 and the fourier transform of the size distribution @xmath57 are given by @xmath58 we assume that the time duration of a peak is negligible with respect to the mean time distance between peaks @xcite .",
    "in such a case we can use the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) formalism to calculate the probability density function , @xmath7 , that the number of trades at time @xmath3 is given by @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in terms of the joint distribution @xmath55 the fourier - laplace transform of @xmath7 is given by @xcite @xmath59    we can easily see that as @xmath60 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath61 ) @xmath62/s\\sim\\langle\\tau_c\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath63 is the mean waiting time . hence @xmath64 note that , as @xmath60 we have ( see eq .",

    "we recall that the de technique measures the scaling in a  moving reference frame \" where the average activity is zero , @xmath75 for all @xmath76 . in order to obtain the pdf for @xmath77 in such reference frame we perform in eq .",
    "( [ rhoapprox ] ) the following substitution @xmath78 and after applying the diffusive limit @xmath79 we get , to the lowest order , @xmath80 substituting eq .",
    "( [ 2ndapprox ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 1stapprox ] ) finally yields @xmath81 this equation shows that the smallest exponent between @xmath82 and @xmath83 determines the asymptotic scaling of @xmath7 according to the exponent @xmath84 therefore , the scaling perceived by de is determined by the most anomalous exponent of the scaling between the size of the clusters of activity and the distribution of their time distances .",
    "note that the case @xmath85 agrees with that of eq .",
    "( [ giacomoeq ] ) .",
    "we also observe that we have proven this fundamental result for the most general case in which there is no assumption on the possible correlation , or independence , among intensities and waiting times .",
    "having this in mind , we return to the problem of understanding the scaling exponent @xmath86 appearing in the us dollar - deutsche mark futures market . to what effect is due this scaling ?",
    "in other words , is the exponent @xmath9 determined by the time distance between clusters or by their size ? in order to solve this question we impose a cutoff in the size of the peaks of activity by eliminating those transactions whose time distance from the previous one is below certain threshold @xmath44 ( note that this actually reduces cluster sizes because the number of transactions counted is now smaller ) .",
    "if after this cutoff procedure the scaling remains invariant then @xmath9 would be determined by the time distances and not by the size of the clusters . in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] the de results are shown for different values of the time - threshold @xmath44 ranging from @xmath87 to @xmath88 s. we see there that the slope is practically unchanged which confirms the assumption that the exponent @xmath86 is solely determined by the anomaly in the time distances between the clusters and not by any anomaly of their size .",
    "at the end of the last section , we have indirectly shown that the anomalous scaling @xmath86 observed in data is not caused by fat tails in the peak intensity distribution @xmath17 but by the anomalous scaling in the waiting time distribution between peaks . another more direct way to prove this would have been to single out the peaks on real data and look for their time distribution .",
    "unfortunately it is very difficult , on real data , to define a peak of activity and compute the waiting time distribution between them .",
    "this is because there are peaks of activity that appear at fixed times ( we will call these  deterministic peaks \" ) at the daily opening and closing sessions , at the opening during the day of other markets and even weekly at the opening of each monday @xcite .",
    "these deterministic peaks do not contribute to the increase of entropy .",
    "however , they do affect any estimation of the waiting time distribution making it very difficult to get a reliable estimate of it . a possible way out from this situation would be to generate an artificial time series simulating the real market evolution . in this artificial series , the activity would be replaced by volatility following the accepted correspondence between them  @xcite and we would check there all the scaling phenomena reported up till now .",
    "results of the de analysis for us dollar - deutsche mark futures with @xmath89 ( solid circles ) , the tarch model ( empty circles ) , the sv model ( diamonds ) , and finally for the on - off intermittency model as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqbouchaud ] ) ( crosses).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we will follow this procedure and choose two well accepted models for reconstructing market activity without deterministic peaks : ( i ) the tarch model @xcite , and ( ii ) the stochastic volatility model presented in @xcite .",
    "we will see that both models give the same results than those of the de technique .",
    "we finally discuss the prescription given in eq.([eqbouchaud ] ) based on multi - agent models to see whether it agrees with our results or not .",
    "this particular arch model , called tarch by its authors @xcite , is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the volatility , @xmath92 is the one day return calculated at time @xmath3 , @xmath93 is the heavyside step function and @xmath94 is gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the other parameters , estimated from daily data of the dow jones industrial index from 1988 to 2000 and obtained in @xcite , are : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 @xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ tarch ] ) we generate a time series for @xmath91 .",
    "we then perform the de analysis on this series ( with a time step of 1 day ) by supposing that the number of trades in the i - th day is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( empty circles ) compared with the results on real data for @xmath89 ( solid circles ) .",
    "we clearly see that the tarch model predicts for @xmath100 a scaling exponent @xmath86 which agrees with actual data . for @xmath3",
    "greater than a poissonian time @xmath101 days the model yields @xmath42 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the change in the slope of real data is likely due to the lack of statistics .",
    "moreover , we do not have enough data points to determine whether the change of slope takes place at the same time scale than in the tarch model .",
    "nevertheless , arch - type models ( similar results were obtained with @xmath102 in eq.([tarch ] ) ) seem to take into account the correct structure of the intermittency of financial series .     waiting time distribution for the distance between clusters @xmath14 ( in logarithmic scale ) for the tarch model ( solid circles ) and the sv model ( empty circles ) .",
    "a distinct asymptotic behavior is clearly present : a power law tail with exponent @xmath103 and an exponential decay.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    from the series generated using eq .",
    "( [ tarch ] ) we can also evaluate the waiting time distribution between peaks because now we do not have deterministic peaks and other periodic effects that were present in actual data .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and as we see there that for @xmath104 a good fit is provided by the following power law : @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for @xmath108 a clear exponential ( poisson ) behavior",
    "is present .",
    "this result has a simple physical explanation : if there is a first cluster at time @xmath3 the probability to observe another one just after the first is high while very distant clusters are practically independent which explains the asymptotic poisson observed behavior in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "there exists another way of modelling volatility clustering .",
    "the so - called stochastic volatility models @xcite are an alternative choice to arch models and they are considered to be the most natural extension to the classic geometric brownian motion for the price dynamics in continuous - time finance .",
    "let us start with the zero - mean return @xmath109 ( i.e. , the log - price without drift ) and whose dynamics is given by the following stochastic differential equation @xmath110 where this equation has to be understood in the it sense and @xmath111 is the volatility and @xmath112 is the wiener process , _ i.e. _ , @xmath113 is gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation function given by @xmath114 all sv models assume that the volatility @xmath111 is itself a random process .",
    "there are several ways to describe the dynamics of the volatility @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest models , which still contains almost all the basic ingredients prescribed by real markets , is given by the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process  @xcite @xmath115 one key property of this model is that it exhibits a stationary solution thanks to the existing reverting force quantified by @xmath116 to a certain average @xmath117 , the so - called  normal level of volatility \" .",
    "the stationary solution is a gaussian distribution and the resulting distribution for the return has fat tails @xcite .",
    "in addition , stylized facts such as the negative skewness and the leverage correlation @xcite require that the changes of the volatility be negatively correlated with the random source of return changes .",
    "in other words , the driving noises appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ xeq ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) are anti correlated , that is : @xmath118 where @xmath119 . for the ou sv as given in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) the characteristic exponential time decay of leverage correlation is given by @xmath120 which is typically of the order of few trading days ( see below ) .",
    "although the ou model has some disagreements with observations  @xcite , it is complex enough to catch all the statistical properties that we are studying here .",
    "we therefore simulate the sv model with the parameters estimated from daily data of the dow jones index from 1900 to 1999 .",
    "thus , the reverting force is equal to @xmath121 , the noise amplitude is @xmath122 , the normal level of volatility reads @xmath123 and the correlation coefficient is @xmath124  @xcite .",
    "the results of the de analysis are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( diamonds ) while the waiting time distribution between clusters is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( empty circles ) . in this case , and analogously to the tarch model , we also observe a power law behavior followed by an exponential decay .",
    "the only difference is the value of the poissonian time @xmath125 which for this model is near to 40 days while for the tarch model is approximately 100 days .",
    "we have checked numerically that this difference is due to the fact that the parameters defining each model are estimated from the dow jones index _ over a different period of time _",
    ", much larger for the sv model than for tarch model . in any case",
    ", we can not discard any of these approaches on the basis of the empirical results .      the intermittent model of the activity",
    "is also predicted and studied by several multi - agent or minority game models @xcite .",
    "these models can be connected to on - off intermittency and they generally imply that the persistency of activity is subordinated to a random walk which indicates that the waiting time distribution has the form given in eq.([eqbouchaud ] ) .",
    "as suggested in @xcite we also obtain the so - called variogram of the data , although the results denote that , if a @xmath126 tail is present like in eq.([eqbouchaud ] ) , causing a @xmath127 behavior in the variogram , the tail lasts less than 5 days probably because the fx market is more liquid than the ones considered in @xcite . furthermore the de analysis performed on a series generated according to eq .",
    "( [ eqbouchaud ] ) also leads to a transient followed by the exponent @xmath42 of the asymptotic behavior whereas , as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the transient never exhibits the exponent @xmath86 beyond 1 day but presents a constantly increasing exponent which is most of the time greater than 1 .",
    "we have performed the de analysis on the activity of the tick by tick time series us dollar - deutsche mark futures from 1993 to 1997 .",
    "the results clearly show the presence of an anomalous scaling , for the probability distribution of the activity @xmath7 , near the exponent @xmath86 .",
    "we have also implemented the same analysis on the volatility obtained with the tarch model and with the ou stochastic volatility model .",
    "we find in both cases an excellent agreement between the scaling measured either on the actual data and on the constructed series .",
    "we compare the results with the scheme of the subordination of the volatility to a random walk leading to eq .",
    "( [ eqbouchaud ] ) observing that a power law exponent @xmath128 for the tail of the distribution of the distances between peaks @xmath15 of volatility is more plausible .",
    "we believe that the main reason why the tarch and the sv models give better results is that in on - off intermittency models the occurrence of a peak can be considered as subordinated to a random walk but the weak restoring force ( which has to be included in the model in order to describe mean reversion ) not only causes the final stationarity and the poisson tail of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] but also affects the process of regression to equilibrium modifying in a fundamental way ( from @xmath129 to @xmath130 ) the transient behavior of @xmath15 .",
