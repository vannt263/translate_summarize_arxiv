    "the coalescence of two compact objects due to the emission of gravitational radiation is a possible origin of cosmological gamma ray bursts of the short variety ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , lasting a few tenths of a second @xcite .",
    "previous multidimensional studies have shown that the outcome of such a merger is in all likelihood a dense torus surrounding a supramassive neutron star , likely to collapse to a black hole on a short timescale , or a black hole , if one was already present in the system ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this class of systems has been studied observationally since the 1970s , when the hulse  taylor system was discovered @xcite , and the recent detection of psr j0737 - 3039 @xcite , the tightest binary yet in this class , has only heightened interest in these events .",
    "the final instants before the actual merger will produce a powerful burst of gravitational waves , and the merger waveform itself is expected to reveal details about the equation of state of matter at high densities ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the merger process is intrinsically a three  dimensional event , with no particular symmetry which can be exploited to reduce the complexity of the problem , and must be addressed numerically .",
    "no such calculation is currently evolved for more than a few tens of milliseconds , because of computational limitations .",
    "information about the state of the system after the violent , dynamical merger is essentially over can be obtained , but the final state of the system , on a timescale comparable to the duration of a short grb , can not be addressed .",
    "the steady state structure and composition of post  merger accretion disks has been the focus of several recent studies @xcite , which have included an increasing amount of microphysical detail .",
    "however , the dynamics of the problem have never been followed for an extended amount of time , although progress is being made in this direction @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite , we studied the dynamical evolution of the accretion structures formed after a black hole  neutron star merger under a set of simplifying assumptions .",
    "initial conditions were taken directly from the late stages of the coalescence , modeled in three dimensions using a simple equation of state @xcite .",
    "the disk was then mapped onto two dimensions assuming azimuthal symmetry , and its evolution was followed for 0.2 seconds , comparable to the duration of a short grb .",
    "the equation of state was simple ( ideal gas with adiabatic index @xmath0 ) , and we assumed that all the energy dissipated by viscosity ( modeled with the full expression of the stress tensor , using an @xmath1prescription for the magnitude of the viscosity ) was radiated away .    in this _",
    "we present for the first time dynamical calculations of post  merger accretion disks in two dimensions , @xmath2 , that : ( 1 ) use a realistic and self  consistent equation of state for the fluid in the disk ; ( 2 ) consider the cooling of the disk through neutrino emission , using appropriate rates ; ( 3 ) account for the effects of neutrino opacities and the corresponding optical depths through a simplified treatment and ( 4 ) last for a minimum of 0.4 seconds , comparable to the duration of a short grb .",
    "after the initial merger phase of the binary is completed , a few tenths of a solar mass can be left in orbit around the central black hole ( which has a mass @xmath3  35  @xmath4 ) , in a small disk a few hundred kilometers across .",
    "the densities are high , with @xmath5 , and the corresponding temperatures are @xmath6 . under these conditions",
    ", nuclei are entirely photodisintegrated , and the fluid consists of free electrons , protons , nucleons , plus a small number of positrons .",
    "the nucleons make up a non  relativistic ideal gas , while electrons are degenerate and highly relativistic .",
    "photons are completely trapped due to the extremely high optical depth , and are hence advected with the flow .",
    "the composition of the fluid is determined self  consistently assuming : ( 1 ) charge neutrality and ( 2 ) complete @xmath7equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this allows us to determine the electron fraction @xmath8 and the electron degeneracy parameter ( through the chemical potential ) locally , and to follow it throughout the dynamical evolution .",
    "this is important since the composition directly affects the neutrino emission rates ( see below ) .",
    "the equation of state is then given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the constant corresponding to a fully degenerate , relativistic electron gas , @xmath11 is the number of baryons per electron , and @xmath12 is the pressure due to the presence of neutrinos in the optically thick regions of the disk ( see below ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "the electrons are not fully degenerate , since @xmath13 is in the range 24 ( @xmath14 is the electron chemical potential ) .",
    "however , this represents a small error in the equation of state , since gas pressure dominates the overall balance , contributing about 90% of the total pressure , followed by electron degeneracy pressure at around 5% .",
    "neutrinos are emitted abundantly in the disk , due to the high temperatures and densities .",
    "we take into account all of the following processes : ( 1 ) nucleon  nucleon bremmsstrahlung ; ( 2 ) @xmath15 pair annihilation ; ( 3 ) electron and positron captures onto free nucleons and ( 4 ) plasmon decay . in practice ,",
    "the global cooling rate is completely dominated by @xmath15 captures , and is hence well approximated by @xcite : @xmath16^{9 } \\ , t_{11}^{9 } \\ , \\mbox{erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-3}$}\\label{qcap2}\\ ] ] in the regime where electrons are degenerate .",
    "this expression has been used directly to compute the cooling within the disk . the error in doing so , as opposed to a full integration over the phase space , is limited to about a factor of 2 ( in the inner regions , where the cooling is most intense ) , as compared with rates extrapolated from the work of @xcite .",
    "the emitted neutrinos are not entirely free to leave the system , since scattering off free nucleons is important .",
    "the optical depth for neutrinos can be estimated as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a typical disk scale height , and @xmath19 is the mean free path between scatterings .",
    "the cross section depends on the mean neutrino energy as @xmath20 @xcite , and @xmath21  mev ( @xmath22  g  @xmath23 ) , using the fact that neutrinos are being produced by reactions involving degenerate electrons ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this amounts to a surface of last scattering for neutrinos , or `` neutrino  surface '' at @xmath24 g  @xmath23 . our simple treatment of this fact consists of suppressing the local cooling rate by a factor @xmath25 , and adding a pressure term @xmath26 $ ] to the equation of state .",
    "this simple alteration is crucial in determining the energy output of the disk .",
    "we note that no modification in the composition was computed owing to this fact . in reality",
    ", the opaqueness of the material will lead to an increase in the electron fraction @xmath8 , by up to a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "the optical depth will thus rise by a factor @xmath27 , making the optically thick region in the disk larger and the overall luminosity slightly lower .",
    "any energy release in neutrinos will thus be spread over a longer period , making our estimates concerning time scales fall on the conservative side ( see below , section  [ transitions ] ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution is followed for at least 0.4 seconds in the central newtonian potential produced by the black hole , @xmath28 , using a two dimensional smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code in azimuthal symmetry @xcite .",
    "accretion is modeled by placing an absorbing boundary at the schwarszchild radius @xmath29 , and the mass of the black hole is updated continuously .",
    "there is no external agent feeding the disk with matter , and no boundary conditions need to be specified ( other than for accretion ) .",
    "the equations of motion and the energy equation contain all the terms for a physical viscosity derived from the stress tensor @xcite , and we use an @xmath1prescription for the coefficient of viscosity , with @xmath30 .",
    "the dissipated energy is injected back into the disk as thermal energy , and may leave the system depending on the local cooling rate ( see above ) .",
    "if the disk is assumed to be optically thin everywhere , and the effects discussed above are ignored , the neutrino luminosity is a smooth , monotonically decreasing function of time , similar to what we obtained in previous work ( we have confirmed this in trial runs with the present input physics ) .",
    "accounting for a variable optical depth leads to behavior that is markedly different , as can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ] , where @xmath31 is shown for three values of the viscosity parameter @xmath1 . for a high viscosity , @xmath32 ,",
    "the accretion timescale is so short ( 40  ms ) , that most of the material is accreted onto the black hole and has no time to radiate away its internal energy reservoir of @xmath33  erg .",
    "the disk becomes entirely optically thin at around 30  ms , and this explains the rebrightening that is observed .",
    "the luminosity subsequently exhibits a power law decay , as in the trial runs with no optical depth effects , with @xmath34 .    for lower viscosities ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "the behavior is qualitatively different at early times , and is a consequence of the longer accretion timescales : 0.4  s and 1  s respectively ( we note here that all our estimates of @xmath36 are based on the actual accretion rate , i.e. @xmath37 ) .",
    "quite simply the material in the disk is allowed to remain in the vicinity of the black hole without being accreted , at high temperatures and densities ( since the transport of angular momentum is so inefficient ) , and radiate away essentially all of its internal energy through the emission of neutrinos .",
    "once this occurs , on a cooling timescale given by @xmath38 , a break occurs ( at @xmath39  ms for @xmath35 respectively ) and the luminosity drops again as @xmath40 . at this stage",
    "the energy output comes directly from viscous dissipation within the disk . the break time is determined by how much energy the disk holds initially , @xmath41 , and by the rate at which it is lost , @xmath31 , which is itself fixed by the densities and temperatures found within it .",
    "the limitation on the cooling rate imposed by high optical depths is essential , and allows the energy loss to be spread over an extended period of time .",
    "for the three calculations shown here , the total energy release in neutrinos , up to 0.4  s , is @xmath42  erg)@xmath43 , for @xmath44 , respectively . assuming that this energy is converted to @xmath15 with a one per cent efficiency in the regions along the rotation axis through @xmath45 annihilation , approximately 10@xmath46  erg could be released and made available for the production of a relativistic fireball .",
    "a detailed calculation of this is left as future work .",
    "the other important mechanism by which a grb might be powered is mhd energy extraction , either through the blandford ",
    "znajek mechanism @xcite , or through a magnetically dominated jet .",
    "since our code does not explicitly account for the presence of magnetic fields , we make a simple , rough estimate of the magnetic field strength by assuming that its energy density , @xmath47 , is in equiparition with the internal energy density , @xmath48 ( this is clearly an upper limit ) . within the disk",
    ", the field will be most intense where the density is highest .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the maximum density in the disk as a function of time , for the same calculations as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the inferred magnetic field is @xmath49  g. it is again evident that the high  viscosity case is markedly different from the other two , showing a significant prompt decrease in @xmath50 .",
    "the transition to complete transparency to neutrinos occurs at around 40  ms .",
    "the balance between cooling , which produces vertical compression ( and hence a rise in central density ) , and accretion , which slowly reduces the mass of the disk , produces a break in the curves for @xmath51 at @xmath52  s respectively . the total estimated energy release through the blandford ",
    "znajek mechanism is @xmath53  erg)@xmath54 , for @xmath55 ( up to 0.4  s ) , @xmath56 ( up to 0.4  s ) , @xmath57 ( up to 1.2  s ) , respectively .",
    "in addition to the temporal variations in total luminosity , there is a spatial transition within the disk , when the optical depth is around unity . for the calculations with @xmath58",
    ", there is always ( up to the end of the run ) an opaque region in the center of the disk .",
    "the density @xmath59 and entropy per baryon @xmath60 along the equatorial plane ( @xmath61 ) , as well as density contours in the @xmath62 plane , are plotted in figure  [ fig3 ] , 0.2  s after the beginning of the calculation with @xmath56 .",
    "we also show for comparison the equatorial density profile of the disk in a calculation that did not take into account the effects of optical depths ( dashed line in figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "there is a clear break at @xmath63  cm , where @xmath64 .",
    "as the optical depth increases and the cooling is suppressed , the pressure rises , inhibiting the thinning of the disk and the increase in density in the inner regions .",
    "this break is essentially a stationary feature , due to the relatively long accretion time scales , as long as the optically thick region is present .",
    "we believe this transition is significant , as geometrically thick accretion flows around rotating black holes , with @xmath65 , are believed to be more favorable for the production of energetic outflows than thin flows , where @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of accretion disks resulting from dynamical three dimensional binary coalescence calculations , where a neutron star is tidally disrupted before being swallowed by its black hole companion , is studied numerically .",
    "angular momentum transport and the associated energy dissipation are modeled using an @xmath1 prescription . by assuming azimuthal symmetry we are able to follow the time dependence of the disk structure for a fraction of a second , a time comparable with the duration of short grbs . during this time , the rate of mass supply to the central black hole is of the order of a fraction of a solar mass per second ; i.e. much greater than the eddington rate . although the gas photon opacities are large , the disk becomes sufficiently dense and hot to cool via neutrino emission .",
    "there is in principle no difficulty in dissipating the disk internal energy , but the problem is in allowing these neutrinos to escape from the thomson thick inflowing gas .    at sufficiently low accretion rates , @xmath67 , we find that the energy released by viscous dissipation is almost completely radiated away on a timescale given by @xmath68  s. in contrast , for a higher mass supply , @xmath69 , energy advection remains important until the entire disk becomes optically thin , at @xmath70\\sim 30 $ ] ms .",
    "the restriction on the cooling rate imposed by high optical depths is key because it allows the energy loss to be spread over an extended period of time ( i.e. @xmath71 or @xmath70 $ ] ) during which the neutrino luminosity stays roughly constant . in principle",
    ", neutrinos could give rise to a relativistic pair dominated wind if they converted into @xmath72 pairs in a region of low baryon density .",
    "this gives a characteristic timescale for energy extraction , and may be essential for determining the duration of neutrino - driven , short grbs .    an alternative way to tap the torus energy is via magnetic fields threading the disk : the energy liberated by accretion",
    "is converted efficiently into magnetic form and emitted as a magnetically dominated outflow .",
    "the launching of a jet probably requires the existence of a poloidal magnetic field of magnitude @xmath73 over a scale of radius @xmath74 , where @xmath73 is smaller than the field strength @xmath75 associated with the dynamo - driven magnetic disk viscosity @xcite .",
    "this results directly from estimating the accretion and jet luminosities as @xmath76 , and @xmath77 respectively , which gives @xmath78 . assuming the scaling @xmath79 , derived by @xcite , one obtains @xmath80 . in order to achieve @xmath81 , @xcite argue that a number @xmath82 of neighboring annuli in the disk need to provide a locally generated net poloidal field in the same direction .",
    "they notice that since the local dynamos vary on timescales of @xmath83 , the timescale for establishing a change in the magnetic field in the disk should be of the order @xmath84 . in our case @xmath85 , which gives @xmath86 ms .",
    "this corresponds to the typical variability timescale of short duration grbs @xcite .",
    "two further physical effects , noted previously in a more general context , are relevant for the present study .",
    "first , the mechanism by which a jet is launched is not scale ",
    "free @xcite , and thus the poloidal field must be established in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "second , in these same regions , the inflow speed caused by angular momentum loss to the outflow is increased , up to a factor @xmath82 over the value expected from magnetic viscosity alone @xcite .",
    "thus the poloidal flux generated by the dynamo can be effectively trapped .",
    "this probably implies that once the dynamo process generates a global poloidal field , it is able to maintain it during the lifetime of the thick portion of the disk , @xmath70 $ ] . for the typical parameters studied here , this timescale could be of the order of seconds when the rate of mass supply is low ( i.e. @xmath87 ) .",
    "there is thus no problem in principle in accounting for sporadic large - amplitude variability on timescales as short as one millisecond , even in the most long - lived short grbs .",
