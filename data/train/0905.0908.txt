    "( 2 ) in the numerical simulation of the collapsar launching relativistic outflow , people found highly variable energy deposition in the polar regions in a timescale as short as @xmath12 ms @xcite .",

    "a plausible scenario is the _ photosphere - internal shock model _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "if the electrons are accelerated by gradual magnetic energy dissipation rather than by internal shocks , it is called the _ photosphere - gradual magnetic dissipation model _ @xcite .",
    "there is an increasing interest in these two kinds of models since : ( 1 ) in the spectrum analysis people did find evidences for a thermal emission component in dozens of bright grbs @xcite .",

    "( 4 ) the grb efficiency can be much higher than that of the internal shock model ( see * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) .",
    "in this section we test these four models with the current fermi grb data .",
    "it is somewhat surprisingly to see that none of these models have been ruled out .        in this model ,",
    "the outflow is baryonic and the thermal emission during the initial acceleration of the outflow is ignorable .",

    "the convenience @xmath30 has been adopted in cgs units except for some specific notations .",
    "the ssc radiation will peak at @xmath31 taking into account the energy loss of the electrons via inverse compton scattering on prompt soft gamma - rays , the cooling lorentz factor can be roughly estimated as @xmath32 in reality @xmath33 is always larger than 1 .",
    "the derived @xmath34 just means that the electrons have lost almost all their energies and are sub - relativistic .",
    "prompt high energy photons above the cut - off frequency @xmath35 will produce pairs by interacting with softer photons and will not escape from the fireball .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we have @xmath36    the ssc radiation spectra can be approximated by @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath27 ) .",

    "what conditions can shock acceleration generate a particle distribution with @xmath66 , with a significant fraction of the outflow energy deposited in the nonthermal particles ?",
    "there could be two ways .",

    ", the fraction of shock energy given to each electron / positron will be much smaller than that in the case of a pair - free outflow and a @xmath66 is achievable @xcite .",
    "the other way is to assume that the particle heating is continuous . in the internal shock scenario",
    ", this could happen if an outflow shell consists of many sub - shells and the weak interaction between these sub - shells may be able to produce multiple shocks that can accelerate electrons continually with a very small @xmath67 .",
    "since both @xmath68 and @xmath33 are @xmath69 , the eic spectrum should be @xmath70 in the mev - tev energy range and there is no gev excess for @xmath48 , consistent with the fermi data .",

    "that s why people concentrate on the internal shocks with a magnetization @xmath79 @xcite .    for the magnetized internal shocks with @xmath80 ,",
    "no significant high energy emission is expected since : ( a ) the ssc emission of the internal shocks is weak .",
    "therefore there is no distinct gev excess in the spectrum .",
    "( b ) the synchrotron - radiation spectrum may be very soft , which renders the detection of gev photons from grbs more difficult .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "for an isotropic diffusion and a relativistic shock , the electron energy distribution index can be estimated by @xcite @xmath81 however , in the presence of a large scale coherent magnetic field , the diffusion is highly anisotropic rather than isotropic @xcite .",

    "+   +    [ tab : stat ]    as summarized in tab.[tab : stat ] , for the magnetized internal shock model , a high linear polarization level should be typical , while for two other models a moderate / high linear polarization degree is still possible but much less frequent .",
    "so the statistical analysis of the grb polarimetry results may be able to distinguish the magnetized internal shock model from the others ( see aslo * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the photosphere - internal shock model the polarization degree",
    "is expected to be strongly frequency - dependent .",
    "such a remarkable behavior , if detected , labels its physical origin .",
    "indeed there were some claims of the detection of high linear polarization degree in the soft @xmath49ray emission of grb 021206 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* however see rutledge & fox 2004 ) , grb 930131 , grb 960924 @xcite , grb 041219a @xcite , and grb 061122 @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with each other as the errors are very large .",
    "the situation is inconclusive and additional data is needed to test these results .",
    "measuring polarization is of growing interest in high energy astronomy .",
    "new technologies are being invented , and several polarimeter projects are proposed , such as , in the gamma - ray band , there are the advanced compton telescope mission @xcite , poet @xcite and others ( see * ? ? ? * for a summary ) .",
    "so in the next decade reliable polarimetry of grbs in gamma - ray band may be realized and we can impose tight constraint on the models . at present ,",
    "the most reliable polarimetry is in uv / optical band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the optical polarimetry of the prompt emission and the reverse shock emission require a quick response of the telescope to the grb alert .",
    "this is very challenging .",
    "mundell et al . ( 2007 ) reported the optical polarization of the afterglow , at 203 sec after the initial burst of @xmath49rays from grb 060418 , using a ring polarimeter on the robotic liverpool telescope .",
    "their robust ( @xmath185 confidence level ) upper limit on the percentage of polarization , less than @xmath186 , coincides with the fireball deceleration time at the onset of the afterglow .",
    "such a null detection is , however , not a surprise because for this particular burst the reverse shock emission is too weak to outshine the unpolarized forward shock emission @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the robotic liverpool telescope performed the polarimetry measurement of the reverse shock emission of grb 090102 ( kobayashi 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , it is straightforward to show that the reverse shock of grb 090102 is magnetized .",
    "consequently the optical flash is expected to be highly polarized .",
    "if confirmed in the ongoing data analysis , the magnetized outflow model for some grbs will be favored .",
    "the site of the prompt @xmath49ray emission may be an ideal place accelerating protons to ultra - high energy @xcite .",
    "these energetic protons can produce high - energy neutrinos via photomeson interaction , mainly through @xmath187-resonance @xcite .",
    "the resulting neutrinos have a typical energy @xmath188^{-1}$ ] .",
    "significant detections are expected if grbs are the main source of ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the proton spectrum is not significantly softer than @xmath189 .",
    "the current fermi observations do not provide an observational evidence for such a flat particle spectrum .",
    "below we discuss the detection prospect of pev neutrinos implicated by the non - detection of high energy emission from most grbs . in the magnetized outflow model ,",
    "the acceleration of a significant part of protons to energies @xmath190 ev is highly questionable because of the resulting soft proton spectrum . in the photosphere - internal shock model , @xmath191",
    "is needed @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of accelerating protons to very high energy depends on the mechanism of the particle heating .",
    "for example , in the case of multiple internal shocks , each pair of internal shocks are expected to be very weak since @xmath192^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath193 is the lorentz factor representing the strength of the shock ( @xmath194 for newtonian shocks ) .",
    "so the acceleration of the protons to ultra - high energy is less efficient than the standard internal shocks .",
    "this is particularly the case if the acceleration is mainly via second - order fermi process , in which the acceleration of particles depends on the shock velocity sensitively .    even in the standard internal shock model , the generation of @xmath195 ev protons and",
    "the production of pev - eev neutrinos may be not as promising as that claimed in most literature adopting a proton spectrum @xmath196 .",
    "such a flat spectrum is predicted for _ newtonian _ shocks and has been confirmed by the supernova remnant observations .",
    "but the typical mev spectrum @xmath50 @xcite of grbs suggests @xmath197 , supposing the accelerated protons and electrons have the same spectrum .",
    "the non - detection of @xmath0 mev photon emission from most grbs implies soft electron ( possibly ) and proton spectra .",
    "given a proton spectrum @xmath198 that is predicted in the relativistic shock acceleration model ( the first - order fermi mechanism ) , the kinetic energy of the ejecta needs to be @xmath199 times of the @xmath49ray radiation energy if grbs are indeed the main source of the observed @xmath200 ev cosmic rays ( see * ? ? ? * and the reference therein ) . in other words",
    ", the grb efficiency should be as low as @xmath201 .",
    "if correct , the number of protons at @xmath202 ev will be quite a few times what assumed in @xcite .",
    "correspondingly the pev neutrino flux will be higher .",
    "however , the current afterglow modeling usually yields a typical grb efficiency @xmath203 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or larger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "below we discuss a new possibility  the proton spectrum is curved . in the  low - energy \" part , the spectrum may be steepened significantly by the leakage of the very high energy cosmic rays from the ejecta ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) .",
    "the  high - energy \" spectrum part may be a lot flatter .",
    "for example , in the numerical simulation of cosmic rays accelerated in some supernova remnants , a spectrum @xmath204 at the high energy part is obtained ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if holding for grbs as well and grbs are the main source of the @xmath195 ev cosmic rays , the pev neutrino spectrum will be harder than that predicted in @xcite .",
    "for instance , the neutron spectra @xmath205 and @xmath206 in their fig.3 will be hardened by a factor of @xmath207 .",
    "but the total flux may be just @xmath203 times that predicted in @xcite because in this scenario the protons are not as many as that suggested in a flat spectrum @xmath208 for @xmath209 ev .",
    "there is a process , ignored in some previous works , that can enhance the detection prospect a little bit . after the pions ( muons )",
    "are generated , the high energy pions ( muons ) will lose energy via synchrotron radiation before decaying , thus reducing the energy of the decay neutrinos ( e.g. guetta et al . 2004 ) . as a result , above @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) , the slope of the corresponding neutrino spectrum steepens by 2 , where @xmath212 is the luminosity of the @xmath49ray emission @xcite .",
    "however we do not suggest a smooth spectral transition around @xmath213 or @xmath214 because the cooling of pions ( muons ) will cause a pile of particles at these energies ( see also murase & nagataki 2006 ) .",
    "a simple estimate suggests that the number of neutrinos in the energy range @xmath215 should be enhanced by a factor of @xmath216 . a schematic plot of the muon neutrino spectrum in the standard internal shock model is shown in fig.[fig : schematic ] .",
    "in the pre - fermi era , it is widely expected that significant gev emission will be detected in a good fraction of bright grbs if they are powered by un - magnetized internal shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the detection of a distinct excess at gev - tev energies , the ssc radiation component of such shocks , will be a crucial evidence for the standard fireball model .",
    "the non - detection of the gev spectrum excess in almost all fermi bursts @xcite is a surprise but does not impose a tight constraint on the models .",
    "for example , in the standard internal shock model , the non - detection can be attributed to a too large @xmath217 tev and a relative low @xmath218 gev . some alternatives , such as the photosphere - internal shock model ,",
    "the magnetized internal shock model and the photosphere - gradual magnetic dissipation model , can be in agreement with the data , too ( see tab.[tab : sum ] for a summary ) .",
    "we attribute the delay in the onset of lat detection in quite a few fermi bursts to the unfavorable condition for gev emission of the early outflow ( see section [ sec : gev - delay ] for details ) .",
    ".the physical reasons for the lack of gev spectrum excess in most grbs . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sum ]    with the polarimetry of grbs people can potentially distinguish between some prompt emission models ( see tab.[tab : stat ] for a summary ; see also toma et al .",
    "we show in section [ sec : lin - thermal ] that in the photosphere - internal shock model the linear polarization degree is roughly anti - correlated with the weight of the thermal component and will be highly frequency - dependent .",
    "such a unique behavior , if detected , labels its physical origin .",
    "however , a moderate / high linear polarization level is expected only when the line of sight is outside of the cone of the ejecta ( i.e. , @xmath219 ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath220 is needed otherwise the burst will be too weak to perform the gamma - ray polarimetry .",
    "consequently the detection prospect is not very promising .    in this work we have also briefly discussed the detection prospect of prompt pev neutrinos from grbs",
    ". the roles of the intrinsic spectrum of the protons and the cooling of pions ( muons ) have been outlined .",
    "the latter always increases the neutrino numbers at the energies @xmath213 or @xmath214 by a factor of 3 .",
    "the former , however , is uncertain .",
    "if the protons have an intrinsic spectrum @xmath198 and have a total energy about tens times that emitted in gamma - rays , the detection prospect would be as good as , or even better than that presented in @xcite .",
    "if the proton spectrum traces that of the electrons , i.e. , typically @xmath197 , the detection prospect would be discouraging .",
