    "they tried a test and criticized the analysis of the nonequilibrium steady state thermodynamics ( sst ) proposed by sasa and tasaki  @xcite . in the last reference the authors state that if there is gas in a one dimensional heat conductive configuration in contact , through a porous wall , with an equilibrium gas state",

    "sasa and tasaki  @xcite proposed an interesting system consisting of a nonequilibrium steady state subsystem in contact with a subsystem in equilibrium as explained below .",
    "this system has three plates as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and there is gas between them . the upper and lower plates ( plates 1 and 3 ) are normal plates . the central plate ( plate 2 ) has pores through which gas can pass .    following sasa and tasaki , we consider the system consisting of three infinite parallel plates 1 , 2 and 3 separated by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1 axis is defined perpendicular to them while an @xmath2 axis is placed on plate 2 .",
    "the pores in plate 2 are distributed homogeneously .",
    "plates 1 and 2 have fixed temperature @xmath3 while plate 3 has a different ( fixed ) temperature @xmath4 .",
    "after a sufficiently long time , by effusion , some of the gas passes through plate 2 and the gas between plates 1 and 2 reaches an equilibrium state .",
    "the system between the plates 2 and 3 reaches a nonequilibrium steady state with translation symmetry along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "we assume that the typical distances between pores is very small and that the diameter of the pores is also very small , so that the ratio between such lengths and the mean free path is much smaller than unity . having no external force and no hydrodynamic velocity",
    "there is no heat flux parallel to the plates .",
    "the system is in a static configuration .",
    "in general , there is a difference between the temperatures of the plates and the temperatures of the gas in contact with them , this is a well - known effect called thermal slip .",
    "however , for simplicity sake , we assume that the temperature of plate 2 and the gas in contact on both sides of it are equal , namely we are neglecting the knudsen layer",
    ".    the velocity and the peculiar velocity of the gas will be denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the condition that there is no mass flux through plate 2 is @xmath7 where @xmath8                        \\exp{\\left[-\\frac{c^{2}}{2t_{1}}\\right]}$ ] is the equilibrium distribution function associated to the gas between plates 1 and 2 and @xmath9 is the uniform number density in this same region while @xmath10 is the nonequilibrium distribution function between plates 2 and 3 evaluated at @xmath11 .",
    "next , it is necessary to see how the two distributions satisfy condition  ( [ tsuri ] ) .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] , the boundary ( contact ) condition is very delicate .",
    "we recognize that a more sophisticated analysis is necessary .",
    "however , in cases when strong nonlinearities can be neglected and the system is quite close to equilibrium  so that higher order terms in @xmath53 do not contribute  then the osmotic pressure is positive .",
    "this implies the possibility of the existence of fio .",
    "in addition , in the full - paper  @xcite , the authors point out that eq .",
    "( [ sstb ] ) is directly related to the condition at the wall and this condition is essential to construct the formalism of sst in a complete form which gets a new nonequilibrium extensive quantity which determines the degree of nonequilibrium .",

    "( [ sstb ] ) . within this context",

    "if one were to analyze the problem in such a way then the boundary ( contact ) condition would have to be reconsidered to solve the kinetic equation .",
    "in other words , one would have to evaluate @xmath49 under the rather complex conditions required by kinetic theory that would lead to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ sstb ] ) . this has not been done .      finally , we briefly comment about eit : extended irreversible thermodynamics  @xcite . for an ideal gas , refs .",

    "it is easily possible to get similar equations to ( [ lbgeq ] ) and to see that the pressure difference predicted by  @xcite is positive and that the difference predicted by  @xcite is zero . in both cases , of course , it is totally unnecessary to use conditions ( [ tsuri ] ) and ( [ masssum ] ) .",
