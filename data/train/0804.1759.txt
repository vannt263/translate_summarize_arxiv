    "since their first experimental observation  @xcite , degenerate boson - fermion ( bf ) systems have been realized using more than five different particle mixtures  @xcite .",
    "the one composed of fermionic @xmath0k and bosonic @xmath1rb particles is the most thoroughly studied : experiments have been performed on its collective excitations  @xcite and on collapse and expansion dynamics  @xcite . using a feshbach resonance to tune the interspecies interaction towards repulsion produced strong signs of phase segregation  @xcite ; the presence of such resonances has also been observed in bf mixtures of different species  @xcite . despite these advances ,",
    "many new physical phenomena still await their experimental realization . in this context",
    ", it has been theoretically predicted that , for homogeneous systems , a multitude of phases appear on varying the interaction parameters  @xcite . in trapped systems , this gives rise to states with a large variety of spatial structures  @xcite .",
    "as is known from experiments with single - component bose and fermi systems , much physical information can be extracted by probing collective motions .",
    "theoretically , the collective excitations of bf mixtures have been intensively studied for the phase - mixed bf system  @xcite , including the regime close to phase - demixing  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the collective excitations of phase - segregated bose - fermi mixtures across phase demixing were considered in case of very small fermionic particle number .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the collective motions of isotropically trapped , fully - segregated @xmath0k-@xmath1rb mixtures .",
    "more specifically , we investigate the eigenfrequencies as a function of the fraction of the total particles that is fermionic , a parameter which is accessible in experiments . using an exact analytic solution for the boltzmann - vlasov equation of a trapped , collisionless fermi gas , we investigate monopole modes and their ( collisionless ) damping . to qualitatively investigate lower symmetry ( multipole ) modes we use a fully hydrodynamic description .",
    "this leads to the prediction of in - phase and out - of - phase modes , with similar oscillations of inner and outer boundaries .",
    "whereas the breathing modes frequencies smoothly cross over from the purely fermionic to the purely bec spectrum , we find that the presence of a small fraction of fermions has a dominant effect on all other modes .",
    "we consider in the following @xmath2 bosons and @xmath3 fermions , trapped by isotropic harmonic confinement @xmath4 with @xmath5 ; we shall take @xmath6 such that both particle species feel the same external potential , as is the case for the experiments on @xmath0k and @xmath1rb mixtures  @xcite . within mean - field theory",
    "the equilibrium state of a bf mixture with chemical potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is fully characterized by the wave function @xmath9 of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and by the fermionic density @xmath10 .",
    "the associated grand potential is  @xcite : @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 the interspecies and bosonic intraspecies coupling constant respectively .",
    "minimization of this grand potential with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath16 gives the thomas - fermi ( tf ) and gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations .",
    "when , however , the particle number is sufficiently large , the ground state configuration is well described using a local - density approximation .",
    "therefore , each point @xmath17 in the trap can be treated locally , using the effective chemical potentials @xmath18 , where @xmath19 the chemical potential at the center of the trap and @xmath20 .",
    "full bf phase segregation appears for sufficiently large interspecies repulsion ; more specifically , it occurs when @xmath21 is larger than @xmath22 at the bf overlap region .",
    "for all the @xmath0k-@xmath1rb trap configurations considered here , this requires the interspecies scattering length @xmath23 to be larger than @xmath24 bohr , which is well below the experimentally reported values of ref .",
    "the phase - segregated bf trap then consists of a purely bosonic core surrounded by a purely fermionic shell ; in between there is a spherical shell where the bosons and fermions overlap .",
    "the thickness of this shell is generally very thin , of the order of the bec healing length @xmath25 . for almost all our further considered configurations",
    "this length is much smaller than the trapping length scales @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the influence of a thin interface on the equilibrium configuration can be incorporated through an interface tension @xmath28 , an exact expression for which is given in eq .   in the appendix .",
    "mechanical equilibrium at the interface implies that the pressures @xmath29 on either side of the interface are related by laplace s formula : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the radial position of the interface ( see fig .  [ diagram ] ) .",
    "finally the particle numbers of the bec core and fermion shell are :    [ numbers ] @xmath32^{2}}{2a_b}\\left[\\frac{\\zeta^3}{3r_b^3}-\\frac{\\zeta^5}{5r_b^5}\\right],\\\\ n_f&=\\frac{[m_f\\omega_{f}r_f^2/\\hslash]^{3}}{72\\pi } [ \\mathcal{k}(1)-\\mathcal{k}(\\zeta / r_f)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 .",
    "the gp and tf equations , together with the number equations   and the condition for mechanical equilibrium at the interface   allow us then to fully determine the equilibrium trap configuration .",
    "having established the equilibrium configuration of the bf system , we now proceed to the description of its dynamics .",
    "we start by discussing the dynamics of a bec , which , as is well known , is governed by the equations of hydrodynamics . then , both collisionless and hydrodynamical behavior is considered for the outer fermi shell .",
    "while a collisionless treatment is experimentally more relevant , the succeeding hydrodynamic consideration allows to bring out some important qualitative aspects of the system s behavior . by combining the fermionic and bosonic dynamics by means of the appropriate boundary conditions",
    ", we then extract collective mode frequencies .",
    "as is usual , collective excitations are treated in a hydrodynamical description by considering small - amplitude density oscillations @xmath34 which linearize the continuity , @xmath35 , and euler , @xmath36 , equations . here",
    ", @xmath37 is the bec condensate density . using standard methods  @xcite",
    ", the chemical potential oscillation @xmath38 with temporal frequency @xmath39 then satisfies : @xmath40 the solution to which is @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the hypergeometric function , @xmath43 the spherical harmonic , @xmath44^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath45 and @xmath46 a positive integer or zero .    here",
    ", we must impose a boundary condition at the bf interface .",
    "since we are assuming that the oscillations occur at local thermodynamic equilibrium  , we conclude that the two fluids are completely immiscible and the interface impermeable .",
    "this immediately leads to the condition @xmath47 in which @xmath48 is a unit radial vector normal to the interface , and the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time .",
    "that is , the interface velocity must be equal to the bec velocity at the interface , ensuring vanishing of the flux of bosons through the interface .",
    "if the fermionic particles are collisionless , as expected at low temperatures , the appropriate dynamical description is the boltzmann - vlasov equation with a vanishing collision integral : @xmath49 the mean - field interaction term is also absent , again because fermionic interactions are suppressed by pauli blocking .",
    "since collisions do not act to restore local equilibrium during the oscillation , the fermi sphere is deformed during the oscillation .",
    "we therefore write @xmath50 , where @xmath51^{1/2}$ ] is the local fermi momentum and @xmath52 with @xmath53 the angle between @xmath17 and @xmath54 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this parametrization is the most convenient for studying spherically symmetric oscillations .",
    ".   then becomes @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the general solution to eq .   can readily be found : @xmath58e^{i\\omega\\tau/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath59 $ ] an arbitrary function of the variable @xmath60   is constant , corresponds to classical orbits in a harmonic potential . ] , and @xmath61/\\omega_f.\\ ] ] physically , @xmath62 is the time for a particle , leaving the interface at an angle @xmath63 and speed @xmath64 , to return to it .    to fix the arbitrary function @xmath65 in the general solution of eq .",
    ", we must once more impose the appropriate boundary condition .",
    "as already explained , the interface is completely impermeable to both particle types ; incident fermions are therefore specularly reflected  @xcite . a boundary condition encoding this process",
    "may be derived using the following arguments , after bekarevich and khalatnikov  @xcite : first , in a frame moving with the interface , the energy of the incident and reflected excitations must be equal ; second , the influx of particles in this frame must be equal to their outflux .",
    "these two conditions result in  @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the velocity of the interface",
    ". one may understand eq .   as follows : for a stationary interface , @xmath68 , all particles incident at angle @xmath53 will be reflected such that @xmath69 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the interface is moving with @xmath70 , then @xmath71 is positive and proportional to @xmath72 ; that is , a ) the reflected state at any given angle becomes more highly occupied than the incident state at the same angle , and b ) the difference in occupancy is largest when @xmath73 , that is , for particles incident normal to the interface .",
    "thus , there is an overall probability transfer to states closer to normal ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "this is due to the momentum transfer from the interface to the reflected particles . at @xmath74 , the solution of the boltzmann - vlasov eq .   which satisfies condition   is : @xmath75.\\ ] ]    demanding local mechanical equilibrium at the interface results in the linearized laplace equation with the role of the fermionic pressure fluctuation played by the radial component of the momentum flux tensor @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath77 with all quantities evaluated at the interface and @xmath78 the departure of the interface from its equilibrium position . solving eqs .   and for @xmath39 fixes the eigenfrequencies .",
    "despite the absence of collisions in the fermionic gas , damping of the collective oscillation may occur , induced by the interaction of the fermions with the interface .",
    "to understand its origin , consider the two time scales relevant in the collisionless fermionic phase : the period of oscillation @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , the time of flight for a particle projected at angle @xmath63 from the interface ( see eq .  ) . from eq .  , @xmath81 diverges if : @xmath82 with @xmath83 an integer ; that is , when there exist particles which depart from and return to the interface in exactly an integer number of oscillation periods . the resulting pole on the integration path in the pressure tensor @xmath84 and thus also in the dispersion relation eq .",
    ", must be avoided by some definite prescription  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate manner is by deforming the contour of integration for @xmath84 so as to pass below the pole  .",
    "this gives rise to an additional , imaginary term due to the residue in @xmath84 ; in this way , the solution for @xmath39 to the dispersion relation acquires a negative imaginary part : damping occurs .    can one intuitively understand when damping occurs ?",
    "in other words , under which conditions are there particles which satisfy eq .  ?",
    "as we will see , whether damping occurs or not depends solely on the interface position and the real part of @xmath39 , @xmath85 , and this remains true for the multipole modes .    for fixed interface position @xmath86 , the time @xmath80 takes values only within a restricted interval  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : damping]a ) .",
    "consider first radially moving particles ( @xmath73 ) ; for vanishing @xmath86 , they take half a trapping period to return to the interface , i.e. , @xmath87 and , as @xmath31 is increased , @xmath80 smoothly vanishes as the interface approaches the trap edge . for @xmath88 , particles projected parallel to the interface ( @xmath89 ) experience a `` centrifugal force '' which is insufficient to overcome the harmonic trapping force such that @xmath90 ; for general @xmath72 , one finds @xmath91 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath92 , a particle with @xmath89 performs exactly half an orbit between two collisions with the interface and therefore @xmath93 ; in this case , @xmath94 for general @xmath72 .    from the possible values of @xmath80 , it is straightforward to obtain the values of @xmath39 and @xmath31 for which damping occurs ( see shaded region in fig .  [",
    "fig : damping]b ) . for small @xmath86 , we have seen that @xmath95 ; but this is exactly half the period of a collisionless fermi gas .",
    "damping is therefore expected for the lowest monopole mode when @xmath96 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath97 , due to a vanishing @xmath80 , eq .",
    "is satisfied only for large values of @xmath39 .",
    "this inhibits damping for the lowest modes in case @xmath98 .",
    "the damping we observe is somewhat analogous to landau damping , which corresponds to energy transfer from collective modes into single - particle incoherent modes . in our case ,",
    "no clear distinction exists between collective and single - particle modes in the fermi gas and energy goes into incoherent excitations in the collisionless gas .",
    "we consider trap configurations containing @xmath99 particles and characterized by the parameters @xmath100 nm and @xmath101 hz  . in fig .",
    "[ fig : collessfreqs ] , we show with full lines the real part of the frequencies of the two lowest monopole modes as a function of the fermi fraction @xmath102 .",
    "the grey and black lines indicate the damped and undamped frequencies respectively .",
    "the lowest monopole mode smoothly crosses over between the value @xmath103 for a fully superfluid bosonic trap at @xmath104 , to the value @xmath105 of the fully collisionless ( fermionic ) trap at @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "as explained earlier , the lowest monopole mode is damped when @xmath107 ; indeed , for @xmath108 , very weak damping is present with a maximum damping rate of about @xmath109 .",
    "as expected , the second monopole mode frequency goes over from @xmath110 at @xmath104 to @xmath111 at @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "its variation , however , is nonmonotonic and considerable damping occurs in the interval @xmath112 ; the associated damping rate @xmath113 is shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig : collessfreqs ] .",
    "the absence of damping for low values of @xmath114 is in full agreement with the explanation given above . in fig .",
    "[ fig : damping]b , we plot the evolution of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath31 ( dashed lines ) for both monopole modes ; damping occurs in the shaded region .",
    "while a collisionless treatment is experimentally more relevant , the following hydrodynamic considerations for the fermions allow us to bring out some important qualitative aspects of the system s dynamical behavior .",
    "the bulk solutions to the continuity and euler equations for fermions are similar to those for the bec  @xcite . the laplace eq .   used for the collisionless case still holds but with @xmath84 replaced by @xmath115 and the impermeability of the interface implies @xmath116 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : collessfreqs ] , we show with dashed lines the frequencies for the breathing modes @xmath117 using a hydrodynamical fermi shell . in fig .  [",
    "fig : hydrofreqs ] , on the other hand , the lowest multipole ( @xmath118 ) modes are shown .",
    "both the multipole modes in which the interface and outer boundary move in phase ( full lines ) and out of phase ( dashed lines ) , are present  @xcite .",
    "both the ip and oop modes have in - phase velocities at the bf interface and are both generic to a two - component system  @xcite .",
    "an interesting result is that the frequencies of all the @xmath118 modes vary strongly at small @xmath114 and remain approximately constant at larger @xmath114 ; this in contrast with the monopole modes .",
    "the mass difference between the @xmath0k and @xmath1rb particles may cause a gravitational sag to be present . incorporating such effect",
    "is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , we expect gravity not to affect the validity of our qualitative results such as the damping mechanism and the presence of out - of - phase modes . note also that the gravitational sag may be quenched experimentally by counterbalancing external potentials or by tight radial confinement .    a finite temperature will change the collective mode frequencies mostly through a change in the fermion dynamics .",
    "we expect @xmath85 to be changed little with temperature , while damping is expected to occur for a broader range of @xmath114 and occurs by the same mechanism as described here  @xcite    our approach fails when the interface is as thin as the outer fermion shell ; we find that this happens for fermi fractions below @xmath119 .",
    "in that case , damping of the collective excitations happens by usual landau damping throughout the bf overlap region  @xcite .",
    "our work is complementary to ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense that they study the process of phase demixing for a fermi fraction @xmath120 whereas we focus on the variation of the fermi fraction in case of complete phase segregation .",
    "we present monopole mode frequencies for the trapped phase - segregated @xmath0k-@xmath1rb mixture .",
    "a damping mechanism is identified which is generic to all collective modes . within a fully hydrodynamic approximation",
    "we then obtain mode frequencies for modes involving out - of - phase and in - phase motions of inner and outer boundaries .",

    "in order to obtain the surface tension of a bf interface , one may consider an infinite space containing fermions at @xmath121 and bosons at @xmath122 , bound by a flat interface which is parallel to the @xmath123 plane .",
    "both species are taken to be untrapped ( @xmath124 and at fixed chemical potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
