    "surfaces of general type with the smallest possible invariants , namely @xmath1 and @xmath2 are called ( numerical ) godeaux surfaces , in honour of l. godeaux who constructed the first such examples .",

    "the conjecture is still open .",
    "for instance , it is still possible that there is a godeaux surface with trivial algebraic fundamental group , whose fundamental group is infinite .",

    "however , this compactification , called the moduli space of stable surfaces , can have many additional irreducible or connected components containing non - smoothable surfaces .",

    "the only obstacle is that we can not assume the general member of a base - point free linear system to be smooth or irreducible , that is , we have to deal with slightly worse curves throughout . as an example of the flavor of arguments that need to be reconsidered carefully : a non - hyperelliptic smooth curve of genus @xmath13 embeds canonically in @xmath14 as the complete intersection of a quadric and a cubic , while the image of the canonical map of the union of an elliptic curve and a non - hyperelliptic curve of genus @xmath0 meeting in a node is the union of a plane quartic and a point not in that plane .    in a companion paper @xcite we will study more in detail examples of gorenstein stable godeaux surfaces and in particular prove that @xmath15 is a cyclic group of order at most @xmath4 .",

    "it remains to show that the polynomials @xmath280 can be normalised as claimed .",
    "substituting @xmath233 in we see that the relation @xmath286 in @xmath282 is divisible by @xmath229 .",
    "since @xmath287 there exists an @xmath288 such that @xmath289 replacing @xmath267 by @xmath290 gives @xmath291    the same argument works for @xmath292 looking at the relation @xmath293 and for @xmath294 looking at the relation @xmath295 this concludes the proof .    one can easily check that with these choices we have the following syzygies of degree @xmath220 : @xmath296    [ lem : relations h ] in @xmath297 the quadratic monomials in @xmath242 , @xmath243 satisfy relations",
    "since @xmath299 we know that we can express quadratic polynomials in @xmath242 and @xmath243 as elements in @xmath110 . to compute one such expression we use that @xmath127 is a non - zero - divisor .",
    "thus @xmath300 we repeat the calculation for @xmath301 , @xmath302 and for @xmath303 , @xmath304    [ thm : restricted canonical ring z/3 godeaux ] let @xmath20 be a gorenstein stable godeaux surface with torsion group @xmath305 and let @xmath306 be the corresponding triple cover . if @xmath307 is the preimage of a paracanonical curve in @xmath20 and @xmath308 then @xmath309/(f_0 , f_1 , f_2 , g_0 , g_1 , g_2 , h_0 , h_0 , h_1 , h_2),\\ ] ] with generators and relations chosen as above .",
    "therefore the canonical ring of @xmath20 can be described as in @xcite by lifting relations and syzygies to @xmath310 $ ] .",
    "a more conceptual approach to this ring is explained in @xcite .    by the above results there is a surjection from the ring on the right hand side onto @xmath136 which is a bijection in even degrees and in degree up to @xmath4 .",
    "assume that some polynomial @xmath311 of odd degree at least @xmath312 is zero in @xmath136 .",
    "by lemma [ lem : s and z s ] it can not be contained in @xmath110 and thus has to involve @xmath242 or @xmath243 . using the relations in @xmath259 we see that @xmath313 reducing modulo @xmath242 we see that @xmath314 , so actually @xmath315 .",
    "however , @xmath242 is not a zero - divisor , thus @xmath316 and consequently @xmath317 as claimed .",
    "the description of the universal cover of godeaux surfaces with torsion @xmath10 has been treated in @xcite and from a slightly different point of view in @xcite .",
    "we did not attempt to extend this description to gorenstein stable godeaux surfaces but believe it should go through : in the smooth case , the following is the starting point of both constructions .",
    "let @xmath114 be the natural double cover of a gorenstein stable godeaux surface with torsion @xmath10 .",
    "then a canonical curve @xmath33 of @xmath96 is honestly hyperelliptic of arithmetic genus @xmath0 .",
    "the canonical curve is a double cover of a paracanonical curve @xmath319 , which is irreducible of arithmetic genus @xmath153 by lemma [ lem : paracanonical 1 ] .",
    "thus the canonical pencil of @xmath79 defines a polynomial subring of @xmath320 and since the image of the multiplication map @xmath321 is contained in @xmath152 we are done .",
    "in this short section we quickly deduce theorem a from the descriptions of the canonical rings in the previous section .",
    "let @xmath20 be a gorenstein stable godeaux surface with torsion of order @xmath322 and @xmath306 the cover associated to @xmath323 .",
    "then we have seen in the preceding section that the canonical ring of @xmath96 , including the action of @xmath7 , is uniquely determined up to the choice of some parameters parametrised by an open set in some projective space .",
    "we know from @xcite that the parameter space is non - empty in each case and thus the image of each of these families is a uni - rational irreducible component .",
    "since the general element corresponds to a smooth godeaux surface and smoothness is an open condition every surface in the family is smoothable .",
    "the canonical rings of simply - connected ( stable ) godeaux surfaces remain elusive ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "when we consider degenerations , the constructions become much more explicit and thus actual computations are possible . in this section",
    "we give a description of the canonical ring of a simply connected gorenstein stable godeaux surface which however rather serves as an indication of the complexity of the problem than as a starting point for a general structure theory .",
    "the computation was carried out by the second author in discussion with roberto pignatelli .",
    "let @xmath250 be homogeneous coordinates in the plane @xmath324 and consider the plane quartic @xmath325 which is union of @xmath326),\\\\   l ' = \\{b=0\\ } =   \\proj ( \\ic[a , c]).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we define an involution @xmath327 on the normalisation @xmath328 of @xmath325 that preserves the conic and interchanges the lines by its action on functions : @xmath329 then as explained in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the triple @xmath331 gives rise to a non - normal gorenstein stable godeaux surface @xmath20 , by glueing @xmath325 to itself as prescribed by @xmath327 .",
    "let @xmath332 be the normalisation of @xmath20 , and @xmath333 the non - normal locus .",
    "then @xmath334 and @xmath33 consists of two irreducible components : a rational curve with one node , which is the image of the conic , and a rational curve with a triple point , which is the image of the lines .",
    "these two components meet transversally at the singular points , that is , @xmath33 has a unique singular point which ( analytically locally ) looks like the coordinate axes in @xmath335 .",
    "then a section @xmath338 descends to a section in @xmath339 if and only if the image of @xmath340 in @xmath341 under the residue map is @xmath327-invariant if @xmath342 is even respectively @xmath327-anti - invariant if @xmath342 is odd .    to do the actual computation we need to pick explicit generators of the respective bundles and compute the residue maps .",
