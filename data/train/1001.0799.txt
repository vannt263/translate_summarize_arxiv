    "in the standard @xmath9cdm concordance cosmology @xcite , structure in the universe grows hierarchically , through a progression of smaller bodies accreting material and merging to form larger systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological @xmath10-body simulations starting from a gaussian random field of linear density fluctuations at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) , together with analytic models of gravitational collapse ( e.g. @xcite ) , have given us a fairly clear picture of how dark matter ( dm ) assembles in the universe .",
    "extended press - schechter theory @xcite provides an analytic formalism for computing halo merger rates and assembly histories , which matches @xmath10-body simulations remarkably well @xcite , and has been used in a variety of semianalytic models of structure formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "simulated dm halos also appear to share a universal internal morphology , with density and velocity anisotropy profiles similar to the generic outcome of violent relaxation following dissipationless collapse or strong tidal shocking @xcite .",
    "there is no such simple theory of hierarchical _ galaxy _ formation , because the luminous components of galaxies are formed through complex baryonic physics .",
    "for instance radiative heating and cooling , star formation ( sf ) and gas expulsion through stellar winds , energy and momentum feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , ram pressure stripping , and resonant effects in dynamically cold systems , are all important ingredients in determining the baryonic structure of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological models of galaxy formation must therefore be calibrated with high - resolution simulations on galactic scales that study these effects in isolation , coupled with direct constraints from observations .",
    "violent relaxation in mergers tends to drive galaxies toward a universal , fully mixed structure @xcite , while gas accretion and stellar outflows produce new dynamically cold components @xcite . from the hot stellar distributions of elliptical galaxies",
    ", we deduce that they are the most merger - dominated systems .",
    "ellipticals and bulges contain the majority of the stellar mass in the local universe ( e.g. @xcite ) , and often serve as a testing ground for theory since they are the most evolved under the complex combination of processes driving galaxy formation . since the violent relaxation in mergers is incomplete , elliptical galaxies retain a wealth of information about their formation histories in their present - day distribution functions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent advances in integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ; @xcite ) , multi - slit infrared spectroscopy @xcite , and triaxial dynamical modeling techniques @xcite have greatly improved our ability to harvest this information .",
    "the sauron project @xcite will produce high resolution , 2d kinematic maps within @xmath11 effective radius ( @xmath7 ) for a representative sample of @xmath12100 nearby elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges , using a panoramic integral field spectrograph mounted on the william herschel telescope .",
    "the data on 48 early - type galaxies released to date has revealed an unexpectedly rich variety of kinematic structures , which poses a new challenge for galaxy formation simulations @xcite .",
    "dynamical modeling studies have shown that , in practice , 2d maps of the first four moments ( @xmath13 ) of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) provided by sauron are typically sufficient to uniquely reconstruct the 3d stellar orbital distribution @xcite .",
    "complex features present in many systems , such as embedded disks and kinematically distinct cores ( kdcs ) , can provide especially strong constraints on the intrinsic structure @xcite .",
    "a good example of the power of these new techniques is provided by the case of ngc4365 .",
    "this massive old elliptical is known for its minor axis rotation @xcite and kdc @xcite , and is therefore a natural candidate for dynamical modeling .",
    "@xcite modeled this galaxy using a velocity field fitting method @xcite that made use of the surface brightness and full 2d velocity map from sauron , but not the higher moments of the losvds .",
    "they found that the system was nearly maximally triaxial , ruling out axisymmetry at @xmath1495% confidence .",
    "a few years later , @xcite modeled the same galaxy using an advanced new triaxial schwarzschild modeling @xcite code that can incorporate all of the losvd moments up to @xmath15 .",
    "they reached a qualitatively different conclusion - that the system was nearly oblate axisymmetric .",
    "the predominance of the minor - axis rotation in the outer parts of the map owed to a high degree of cancellation of the orbits rotating in a prograde and retrograde sense about the short axis , and streaming of the smaller population of orbits rotating about the intrinsic long axis .",
    "they found no major transition in the orbital structure at the boundary of the kinematically `` decoupled '' core , making it unlikely that it formed in a separate infall event .",
    "the orbital structure of the 15 - 20% gas merger remnants in this paper bears a tantalizing resemblance to that of ngc4365 ( compare e.g. our figures  [ fig : kdcs ] -  [ fig : kdcspec ] and  [ fig : rems15 ] -  [ fig : rems20 ] with figures 7 , 11 and 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "however a limitation of the sauron spectrograph is its small field of view , corresponding to @xmath6 on a typical elliptical target .",
    "the outer parts of galaxies are less relaxed than their inner parts , and bar - like modes in mergers efficiently transport angular momentum outward @xcite .",
    "a gas - rich merger between two spiral galaxies with halos might be expected to produce a remnant with three distinct components in its distribution function : ( i ) an inner part formed through dissipation , ( ii ) a middle part reflecting the dynamically cold distribution of the disk stars , and ( iii ) an outer part arising from the pre - existing stellar halo populations .",
    "observations with about four times the spatial coverage of sauron would be able to detect these dynamical subcomponents , and probe the parts of galaxies retaining the most memory of their progenitors angular momentum and internal structure .",
    "hints of increased complexity in the angular momentum profiles at large radii have indeed been observed in a few elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "a number of projects designed to extend sauron - style dynamical modeling out to larger radii are currently underway .",
    "the smeagol survey @xcite will obtain smoothed 2d maps of @xmath13 out to @xmath16 for a representative sample of 25 nearby ellipticals , using the new stellar kinematics with multiple slits ( skims ) technique @xcite with the deimos spectrograph on the 10-meter keck - ii telescope .",
    "the data analysis will include triaxial dynamical modeling with the advanced particle - based method nmagic @xcite .",
    "the wide - field ifs virus - p has been used to obtain 2d stellar kinematics out to @xmath17 for several giant ellipticals @xcite , and multiple pointings of the sauron spectrograph have been used to measure the stellar losvds out to @xmath18 in ngc3379 and ngc821 @xcite .",
    "surveys using globular clusters ( gcs ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) as discrete tracers of the distribution function @xcite can probe much larger radii ( out to @xmath19 ) and place further constraints on dynamical models @xcite .    combined with simulations aimed at establishing the characteristic orbital structure arising from various formation pathways , these observational programs will provide unprecedented insight into the physics of galaxy formation .      to deduce the formation histories of galaxies from their orbital structure , we must identify macroscopic groups of orbits that are confined to a well - defined neighborhood of phase space because they followed similar evolutionary pathways .",
    "the isolating integrals of motion ( or quasi - isolating integrals in the case of perturbed potentials ; @xcite ) parameterize the phase space region in which a star remains localized , and encode whatever information about its initial conditions ( ics ) is preserved once the system is fully phase - mixed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "orbits which conserve at least one isolating integral per degree of freedom are called _",
    "regular_. it is the ubiquity of regular orbits in galaxies that permits the rich variety in their structure , mirroring their varied formation pathways @xcite .",
    "the regular orbits in a static potential can be classified into families that conserve qualitatively similar integrals of the motion , and therefore have similar morphologies . which orbital class",
    "a given star will occupy is determined by the available phase space for different kinds of orbits in the potential , and its ics - the phase space need not be uniformly populated . in a time - varying ( or otherwise non - ideal ) potential such as an ongoing merger , stars diffuse in the space of their conserved integrals , but not completely .",
    "if they do not cross boundaries between the orbital families , then their qualitative character may be preserved from the ics . crossing between orbital boundaries",
    "can serve as a collective relaxation mechanism ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an intuitive grasp of the orbital classes is therefore essential to understanding how dynamical systems evolve and relax .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the types of regular orbits that are possible in various idealized potentials , leading up to a classification of the orbits in triaxial systems into families that conserve similar integrals . for a more thorough and rigorous presentation",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the simplest conceivable model is a spherical potential . in this case",
    "the symmetry about all three cartesian axes implies conservation of the angular momentum vector , so every orbit is confined to a plane .",
    "the star oscillates in radius with frequency @xmath20 while precessing in azimuth with frequency @xmath21 .",
    "if these two frequencies are commensurate ( @xmath22 for some integers @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) then the orbit closes on itself , as in a kepler potential .",
    "more generally , the orbits form rosettes that eventually fill an annulus between the minimum and maximum of the radial oscillations ( pericenter and apocenter ) .",
    "very few galaxies are spherical , but many are consistent with axisymmetry . in an axisymmetric potential",
    "the angular momentum component about the symmetry axis , @xmath25 , is conserved .",
    "the direction of @xmath26 precesses about the @xmath27 axis as @xmath28 and @xmath29 vary .",
    "the radial oscillations no longer return the star to the exact same pericenter and apocenter every cycle , but are still bounded between some @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "two orbits with the same energy and @xmath25 can look quite different from each other , ranging from orbits nearly confined to the @xmath32 plane , resembling eccentric orbits in a thin disk , to puffed - up orbits nearly filling a spherical annulus over long times .",
    "this suggests that the orbits are constrained by another integral in addition to @xmath33 and @xmath25 , related to how the energy is apportioned into vertical and radial motion .",
    "though it can not be expressed analytically for a general axisymmetric potential , this third integral ( @xmath34 ) allows an assortment of stable axisymmetric systems , from thin disks formed by quiescent accretion , to nearly spherical systems heated by persistent perturbations or discrete encounters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however some galaxies show clear evidence of nonaxisymmetric shapes ( e.g. @xcite ) , and simulations of dissipationless violent relaxation in mergers or collapses generically produce triaxial remnants ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is a unique density distribution stratified on similar triaxial ellipsoids whose potential is separable in ellipsoidal coordinates @xcite , known as the `` perfect ellipsoid '' .",
    "its distribution function and integrals of motion can be expressed analytically , and its orbital structure has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the orbits in the perfect ellipsoid were classified into four major families by @xcite : short - axis tubes ( @xmath3tubes ) which rotate about the short ( @xmath3)axis of the potential , two classes of long - axis tubes ( @xmath4tubes ) which revolve about the long ( @xmath4)axis , and box orbits which behave like perturbed simple harmonic oscillators .",
    "because it is analytic , this model has been widely used as a starting point for understanding the orbital structure of more general triaxial potentials .",
    "tube orbits resemble the orbits in axisymmetric potentials , and may be thought of loosely as precessing ellipses driven by the bar - like potential of the triaxial ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "they conserve angular momentum - like integrals and therefore avoid the origin of the potential and the zero - velocity surface . it can be shown that @xmath35tube orbits rotating about the intermediate axis in the perfect ellipsoid are unstable to vertical perturbations @xcite , but both @xmath4tube and @xmath3tube orbits are allowed .",
    "observations of both major- and minor - axis rotation in some elliptical galaxies therefore strongly suggests that these systems are triaxial @xcite .",
    "@xmath4tube orbits are most prevalent in prolate potentials , and are populated by stars with large initial angular momenta about the long axis .",
    "@xmath3tubes are the dominant type of orbit in oblate systems .",
    "tube orbits oscillate in radius within some bounds @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and one component of @xmath26 never switches sign .",
    "any net angular momentum of a triaxial system must be carried by the tube orbits , so only these orbits can retain information about a galaxy s initial sense of rotation .",
    "just as tube orbits may be thought of as precessing ellipses , box orbits may be regarded loosely as axial orbits ( or elongated ellipses ) _ librating _ about the @xmath4axis .",
    "@xcite illustrated the transition between box and tube orbits using an intuitive toy model .",
    "imagine an elliptical ring lying in a concave , frictionless trough , with its long axis initially parallel to the long axis of the trough , as shown in figure  [ fig : ellipse ] .",
    "this configuration allows the ring to lie as low in the trough as possible .",
    "now imagine trying to spin the ring in the trough , by applying an impulsive kick of energy @xmath38 to one of its ends .",
    "to spin all the way around the ring must go up and over a barrier , since the curvature of the trough along the perpendicular direction is greater .",
    "there is some critical precession frequency @xmath39 , above which the ring will get over the barrier .",
    "below @xmath39 it will just librate about the equilibrium configuration , with no definite sense of rotation .",
    "the trough s different curvature along the two axes is analogous to triaxiality of a gravitational potential , and the librating mode is analogous to box orbits .",
    "if the curvature is the same along both directions perpendicular to the rotation axis ( as in an axisymmetric potential ) , then the energy barrier is zero .",
    "note also that the effective barrier in a triaxial potential is greatest for a star rotating about the @xmath35axis , since in this case the difference in curvature along the two perpendicular directions is greatest , making @xmath35tubes the most susceptible to instability .",
    "box orbits are prevalent in triaxial systems with shallow inner density profiles , and conserve integrals similar to the energies of independent harmonic oscillations about each cartesian axis .",
    "stars on box orbits have no definite sense of rotation , and can therefore pass arbitrarily close to both the origin ( they are `` centrophilic '' ) and the zero - velocity surface . over time , they densely fill a 3-dimensional box - like region centered on the origin @xcite .",
    "powerful nuclear processes such as gas inflow , starbursts , and black hole growth are thought to be major drivers of galaxy evolution , and box orbits may be responsible for conveying information about the rapidly varying central potential to large radii .",
    "figure  [ fig : howaddsup ] shows an example of how the three orbital classes contribute to the projected surface brightness and kinematics in one of our simulated merger remnants .",
    "the remnant is shown in projection along the @xmath35axis , which maximally separates the orbital classes in 2d space .",
    "the boxes and @xmath3tubes are elongated along the major axis , while the @xmath4tubes are elongated along the minor axis of the projection .",
    "all four surface brightness maps are plotted on the same color scale , to show the relative orbital populations at different locations in the sky plane .",
    "note that the isophotes of each individual orbital class appear boxier than the combined isophotes , which are nearly elliptical in shape .",
    "the @xmath4tube orbits are responsible for the minor - axis rotation in the remnant , and the @xmath3tubes produce the major - axis rotation .",
    "there is a striking difference in the amount of streaming of the two classes of tubes : the velocity scale on the @xmath4tube map is @xmath40145 km / s , while it is only @xmath4053 km / s on the @xmath3tube map .",
    "the remnant therefore appears dominated by minor - axis rotation in the velocity maps , even though @xmath3tube orbits dominate its stellar mass .",
    "two local losvds are shown on the right , at the locations indicated on the maps : one at a point near the center along the major axis ( point a ) and one near the minor axis farther out ( point b ) . at point",
    "a the @xmath3tubes have a flat - topped distribution with a high velocity dispersion and negative kurtosis , indicative of canceling streams rotating in opposite directions .",
    "the box orbits are strongly peaked at @xmath41 , with a large excess in the tails giving the distribution a high positive kurtosis .",
    "the combination of the @xmath3tube and box orbits yields a combined losvd that is closer to a gaussian . at point",
    "b the @xmath4tube orbits make a larger relative contribution .",
    "their losvd is peaked at a high negative velocity and skewed right , indicative of a heated streaming population .",
    "the combined distribution has substantial net streaming motion and is slightly skewed in the direction opposite the mean velocity .",
    "an important idealization in the perfect ellipsoid model is that it asymptotes to a flat core .",
    "most elliptical galaxies actually have central density cusps , with slopes ranging from @xmath42 ( e.g. @xcite ) , which may be thought of as perturbations to the perfect ellipsoid potential .",
    "these perturbations lead to trapping of box orbits by resonances ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath43 for integer @xmath44 ( e.g. @xmath3tube orbits are trapped by the 1:1 resonance between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "stars in an island of phase space around a stable resonance librate around the resonant orbit ; these trapped box orbits , called `` boxlets , '' generally avoid the origin ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as the perturbation grows larger ( the cusp gets steeper ) , more phase space is occupied by resonant islands until they overlap , producing regions populated by ergodic orbits that eventually fill the entire portion of their 5d energy surface not occupied by regular orbits ( e.g. @xcite ) .    for simplicity",
    "we do not distinguish between regular box orbits , boxlets , and ergodic orbits in this paper , and will loosely use the term `` box '' to refer to any orbit with no definite sense of rotation .",
    "this will be sufficient for the global comparison with observations desired in this study .",
    "spectral analysis of selected orbits @xcite reveals that the orbits classified as boxes are generically centrophilic ( at least in the inner parts ) and stochastic , but they remain fairly localized in phase space over a hubble time .",
    "we defer a detailed study of the nature of the box orbits in the remnants to future work .",
    "the effect of an inner cusp on the orbital populations can be understood by means of a simple experiment - adding a central point mass to a flat - cored , triaxial potential with a large population of box orbits .",
    "this `` experiment '' has been studied extensively , since it has direct astrophysical relevance to black holes in the nuclei of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since box orbits pass arbitrarily close to the origin , they are deflected by the point mass at pericenter passage , causing the orbits to diffuse within box phase space .",
    "the velocity changes are primarily along the axis of approach @xcite , the @xmath4axis for box orbits librating about the long axial orbit , so the angular momentum diffusion is mostly in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "eventually the star may wander into @xmath3tube phase space ( there is no space for @xmath35tubes since they are unstable ) .",
    "since box orbits also strike the zero - velocity surface , they convey information about their pericentric evolution to large radii .    as box orbits diffuse across the @xmath3tube boundary , the shape of the potential also becomes more oblate , shrinking the phase space available for boxes and expanding that for @xmath3tubes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a point mass as small as 2 - 3% of the total mass can seed this transformation in a flat - cored , triaxial system @xcite .",
    "when the central mass concentration ( cmc ) is not an ideal point mass , the diffusion timescale varies with the degree of central concentration - in an @xmath48 cusp the timescales are typically longer than the lifetime of a galaxy , while in an @xmath49 cusp they are short @xcite . in hierarchical structure formation",
    ", there is an ongoing exchange between processes that induce triaxiality ( e.g. violent relaxation in mergers ) and gas inflows that deepen the central potential well ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this process therefore undoubtedly plays an important role in galaxy evolution .      in current semi - analytic models",
    ", @xmath50% of the stellar mass in present - day ellipticals and classical bulges assembles through major mergers @xcite .",
    "an elliptical galaxy - sized halo has on average undergone @xmath11 major merger since @xmath51 , the epoch during which most of its stellar mass formed @xcite .",
    "the last major merger was typically between two spiral galaxies , with gas fractions ranging from @xmath52 for systems with stellar masses around @xmath53 , to @xmath54 for @xmath55 systems ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the hypothesis that elliptical galaxies form through mergers between spirals @xcite actually preceded the acceptance of the concordance cosmology by about two decades , based on the properties of the galaxies themselves .",
    "gas - rich tidal tails , and rings and shells indicative of the recent disruption of a dynamically cold system , often surround galaxies otherwise resembling ordinary giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "early simulations of mergers between disk galaxies could explain a wide variety of the properties of observed ellipticals , including their `` @xmath56 '' law density profiles @xcite , slow rotation and anisotropic velocity distributions @xcite , flat rotation curves @xcite , fine structure @xcite , and apparently triaxial shapes @xcite . a simple counting argument based on the numbers of observed interacting pairs and elliptical galaxies in the local universe made the prospect that these pairs turn into ellipticals quite plausible @xcite .",
    "it was apparent that dissipation must play a large role in mergers long before hydrodynamic simulations with realistic gas fractions became feasible @xcite .",
    "the measured phase space densities at the centers of elliptical galaxies far exceed the maximum densities in observed spirals , implying a violation of liouville s theorem unless the initial disks contain @xmath5725 - 30% of their mass in gas @xcite .",
    "dynamically cold components , such as embedded disks and kdcs , are often observed in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the high specific frequencies of gcs in ellipticals relative to spirals imply that mergers must trigger the formation of many new clusters from the available gas @xcite .",
    "more recent simulations have shown that mergers with @xmath58% gas produce remnants that fall on the observed fundamental plane scaling relation @xcite , and that the remnants of 1:1 mergers between 40% gas disks match the 1d kinematic properties of observed ellipticals far better than dissipationless merger remnants @xcite .",
    "2d kinematic maps of gas - rich merger remnants display many of the intriguing features seen in real galaxies , including misaligned rotation , central velocity dispersion dips , counter - rotating disks , and kdcs @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the losvds of simulated gas - rich merger remnants display the same trends as ellipticals in the sauron sample @xcite , and they occupy essentially the same part of the anisotropy - ellipticity ( @xmath59 ) plane as the sauron galaxies ( with the notable exception of some giant slow rotators that are very round , anisotropic , and featureless ; @xcite ) . these results motivate studies of the intrinsic orbital structure of gas - rich merger remnants , to see to what extent the 3d distribution functions of elliptical galaxies can indeed be explained with binary mergers , and shed light on how the observable features arise physically .    to our knowledge , @xcite was the first to apply orbital analysis in the style of @xcite to simulated merger remnants .",
    "he ran a series of dissipationless disk galaxy mergers with varying disk orientations and impact parameters , and classified the stellar orbits in the remnants based on the sign changes in their angular momentum .",
    "he found a wide variety in the remnant shapes and orbital structure , depending on the encounter parameters .",
    "some of the remnants displayed substantial orientation twists ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the mergers often produced both @xmath4tube and @xmath3tube populations with significant net rotation , resulting in large kinematic misalignments .",
    "since the rotation of the majority of observed ellipticals is well - aligned with the major axis , he argued that dissipationless disk mergers can not be the generic way to form elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite classified the stellar orbits in mergers with 10% gas , and found that even this small gas component has a dramatic effect on the remnant shapes and orbital structure .",
    "gravitational torques during the merger drain much of the gas of its angular momentum , causing it to collapse inward and form a dense cmc @xcite , essentially a point mass to stars at @xmath60 .",
    "the cmc destabilizes box orbits , leading to a global transformation of the remnant to a more oblate shape .",
    "this result is not surprising in light of the studies by e.g. @xcite , showing that a central point mass with just 2% of the total mass can globally transform the structure of a triaxial system .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed study of the orbital structure of a large sample of equal and unequal mass merger remnants with 0 and 10% gas @xcite , with an emphasis on relating the intrinsic structure to photometric and 1d kinematic observables .",
    "they studied the relation between the orbital structure and isophotal shapes in further detail in @xcite . using spectral classification @xcite",
    ", they found that box orbits typically dominate the inner parts of the dissipationless remnants , while @xmath4tubes and @xmath3tubes become dominant at larger radii .",
    "the box to @xmath3tube ratio was the primary determinant of kinematic properties such as the location of the remnants in the @xmath61 planes . when a gas component was added , the box population was highly suppressed and the remnants became @xmath3tube dominated and oblate .",
    "the shape of the @xmath3tube orbits in the more axisymmetric dissipative remnants made the isophotes less boxy .",
    "the 1:1 merger remnants were slowly rotating , while the 3:1 remnants were found to be rapidly rotating and disky .",
    "they concluded that observed rapidly rotating ellipticals could form from dissipative 3:1 mergers , but boxy , slowly rotating systems @xcite could not have formed through dissipative disk mergers .    in this work",
    "we analyze the orbital structure of 1:1 merger remnants in simulations including sf and feedback , enabling us to consider the high gas fractions characteristic of spiral galaxies at @xmath62 @xcite . at fixed @xmath0 the effect on the remnant structure",
    "may be diminished by including sf and the dissipational features may become more spatially extended , since the gas can be converted to collisionless material early on in the merger and undergo subsequent violent relaxation .",
    "we quantify the variation of the orbital structure and intrinsic shape with gas fraction for @xmath0 ranging from 0 to 40% , and discuss the physical mechanisms that may be driving the orbital transformations , with direct comparisons against dynamical models of observed systems in mind .",
    "we relate the orbital structure of the remnants to their appearance in 2d kinematic maps on @xmath60 and @xmath63 scales , and show that a wide range of different kinematic structures can be accounted for simply by varying @xmath0 in 1:1 disk mergers .",
    "in  2 we describe our merger simulations and remnant analysis methods , and in  3 we present our results .",
    "the intrinsic structure of our eight dissipationless remnants is presented in  3.1 , as a baseline for understanding the effect of adding a gas component .",
    "we show how the orbital structure and shape of the remnants varies with @xmath0 in  3.2 , and discuss the kdcs and embedded disks that arise in the gas - rich remnants in  3.3 . in  3.4 we briefly describe the structure of the remnants beyond @xmath6 , deferring a more detailed and quantitative presentation to @xcite . in ",

    "the center - of - mass trajectories were well - approximated by point mass orbits .",
    "at least in the inner parts , the final structure is not highly sensitive to our choice of small impact parameter , since the most bound particles ( the stars ) lose most of their orbital angular momentum to the halo by the time the cores merge even in wide encounters @xcite .",

    "we used the scheme proposed by @xcite to sample the space of possible disk orientations in a relatively unbiased way , including prograde , retrograde , and polar orbits .",

    "once on their orbits , the galaxies reach their first pericenter passage at @xmath92 gyrs , at which point their morphologies become strongly distorted by tidal forces from the other galaxy , and the stars and gas each form a bar .",

    "the strong and persistent gravitational torques during the second passage and final merger typically induce a stronger central starburst than at first passage . by about 0.5 gyrs after the merger the size , shape , and velocity dispersion of the remnant ( measured within @xmath6 ) reach a steady state @xcite , and the system may be considered relaxed .",
    "we freeze the potential at @xmath94 gyrs ( about 2.5 gyrs after the merger is complete ) , and represent it using the bi - orthogonal `` designer '' basis expansion @xcite presented in @xcite , @xmath95 the terms in this expansion individually satisfy poisson s equation , and the lowest - order term is a @xcite profile , which should be a good first approximation to the density profile of a remnant resembling an elliptical galaxy . before computing the expansion coefficients we symmetrize the particle distribution by reflecting all of the positions and velocities about the origin , effectively increasing the particle statistics by a factor of two and reducing global fluctuations .",

    "this classification scheme depends on a correct specification of the system orientation , and many of the remnants have intrinsic orientation twists .",
    "we therefore diagonalized the inertia tensor , in the form @xmath104 ( e.g. @xcite ) , in @xmath105 cumulative energy bins , and used the local orientation based on the star s energy for the classification .",

    "overall the remnants are dominated by box orbits in their inner parts ( @xmath145 ) , and tube orbits in their outskirts .",
    "this is not surprising since the @xcite profile , which generically provides a good fit to the density profiles of dissipationless merger remnants , has a shallow inner cusp ( @xmath146 ) and much steeper outer profile ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "the inner shapes of the remnants are typically prolate - triaxial and highly flattened ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) , consistent with previous results for head - on mergers of stellar systems that have shed most of their orbital angular momentum to the halo @xcite .",
    "farther out the remnants become rounder ( @xmath150 ) and closer to maximally triaxial .",
    "see also @xcite , who studied halo shapes in a cosmological context and found that the response of the dm to baryonic condensation into galaxies drives the halos to rounder and more oblate shapes .",

    "on the other hand the @xmath4tube populations are highly streaming , with @xmath115 typically approaching one at large radii .",
    "remnant @xmath143 is a notable exception to this rule , with the rotation of its dominant @xmath4tube orbits canceling nearly perfectly over the full range of radii plotted . upon closer examination of this remnant",
    ", it turns out that this owes to the symmetry of the ics .",
    "both disks on orbit @xmath143 are substantially inclined , but their spins point in opposite directions .",
    "if the @xmath4tube orbits in the remnant are separated by their disk of origin , nearly all of those from disk 1 rotate in one sense about the long axis , while those from disk 2 rotate in the opposite sense , giving the net cancellation seen in figure  [ fig : rems0 ] .",
    "the dissipationless remnants do not show strong orientation twists , and their long axis ( which is typically the axis of symmetry , since the remnants are prolate ) lies in the merger plane ( @xmath151 ) , along the axis of the final coalescence of the stellar components .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of @xcite : the time - varying tidal field along the merger axis couples coherently to the stellar orbits , producing a bounce that elongates the remnant along the direction of tidal compression @xcite .",
    "the kinematic misalignments are large since the net rotation tends to favor the long axis , and noisy since the magnitude of the rotation is often small .    in the @xmath60 kinematic maps ,",

    "[ fig : rems0 ] , the velocity maps are all in projection along the @xmath35axis , to clearly show the rotation of both the @xmath4tube and @xmath3tube orbits and how it varies with @xmath0 .    as @xmath0 increases from 0 to 40% , the population of box orbits within @xmath158 declines , and the @xmath3tube population increases .",
    "the most rapid change in the orbital populations occurs between 0 and 20% gas .",
    "the outer orbital structure ( @xmath159 ) is relatively unaffected by the gas , and the @xmath4tube population does not display an obvious trend .",
    "the variation in the intrinsic shape closely follows the change in the orbital populations . as @xmath0 increases , the inner parts become progressively more oblate ; the 30 - 40% gas remnants are nearly oblate axisymmetric within @xmath60 ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the remnants also become rounder with higher @xmath0 : @xmath161 increases from @xmath120.6 for the dissipationless remnant to @xmath120.8 at the highest gas fractions .    [",
    "fig : disksc ]    though the mass in @xmath3tube orbits within @xmath162 rises substantially as @xmath0 increases from 0 to 15% , the remnants show little change in their major - axis rotation over this range , since the mass in prograde and retrograde orbits is nearly equal ( @xmath163 ) . the 15% gas remnant , though dominated by @xmath3tubes within 1@xmath7 , still appears as a minor - axis rotator in the projected velocity map .    in the 20% gas remnant ,",
    "the innermost @xmath3tube orbits begin to show substantial streaming , in a sense opposite the net rotation farther out .",
    "this inner streaming shows up as a prominent kdc in the velocity map .",
    "note that the minor - axis rotation present at lower gas fractions is still there in this map , but it is dwarfed on the velocity scale by the rapid rotation within the kdc . in the 30 - 40% gas remnants ,",
    "the @xmath3tube orbits show significant streaming ( @xmath164 ) over the full range of radii plotted , and the edge - on kinematic maps display rapid , disk - like major - axis rotation .",
    "this rapid rotation about the intrinsic short axis gives kinematic misalignments near zero in the inner parts .",
    "although the rotation bias of the @xmath3tube orbits in the 30% gas remnant appears fairly uniform , the cause of the streaming in the inner and outer parts is quite different . in the outer parts",
    "the net angular momentum is retained from the ics , and is therefore present at all gas fractions .",
    "the inner streaming is a direct consequence of dissipation - the gas that retains its angular momentum during the merger re - forms a cold disk as it dissipates energy , which forms new stars primarily after the violent relaxation of the merger is complete .",
    "thus the inner part of the gas - rich remnants is a superposition of a hot , slowly - rotating component consisting of the stars present before the merger ( hereafter referred to as `` old stars '' ) , and a maximally rotating disk composed of `` new stars '' formed through dissipation .",
    "this is why @xmath115 is _ only _ around 0.3 despite the high maximum velocities in the maps .",
    "we will elaborate on this point in section 3.4 .",
    "the inner parts of the gas - rich remnants are often rapidly tumbling , which produces large intrinsic orientation twists between @xmath121 and 3@xmath7 , as in the bottom two rows of in figure  [ fig : igfs ] .",
    "note that the orientations in the inner parts of these remnants are an arbitrary snapshot in time ; had the simulation been frozen earlier or later @xmath120 and @xmath121 could have quite different values .",
    "in the preceding discussion we have demonstrated that the low-@xmath0 remnants show little major - axis rotation not because they lack @xmath3tube orbits , but because there is a large degree of cancellation between the @xmath3tubes rotating in opposite directions .",
    "an observer who measured the major- and minor - axis rotation speeds of the typical 10% gas remnant might naively think that the system was prolate in shape and dominated by @xmath4tube orbits , when in fact the predominance of the minor - axis rotation is caused by a sub - dominant population of @xmath4tubes that are highly streaming .",
    "we highlight this point in figure  [ fig : cancellation ] showing remnant @xmath23 at 10% gas , which has comparable masses in @xmath4tubes and @xmath3tubes within @xmath60 , but somewhat more @xmath3tubes ( see figure  [ fig : rems10 ] ) .",
    "the upper left panel is a velocity map of the remnant in a nearly edge - on projection ( maximizing both the major- and minor - axis rotation ) , and the second panel shows the same map with the @xmath4tube orbits removed . without the @xmath4tubes , the remnant shows almost no rotation at all .",
    "the losvds at the locations marked by the white letters are plotted in the lower two panels .",
    "the lower left panel clearly shows the canceling streams of @xmath3tube orbits along the major axis , while the lower right panel depicts the highly streaming @xmath4tubes along the minor axis , peaked at nearly 200 km / s . in the lower left panel ,",
    "the large population of box orbits fills in the gap in the bimodal @xmath3tube distribution , yielding a total losvd that is nearly gaussian in shape .",
    "figure  [ fig : disksc ] provides insight into the physical explanation for this orbital structure by mapping out the locations , in the original disks , of the stars that end up in each of the three orbital classes in remnant @xmath154 , with @xmath1650 , 15 , and 30% .",
    "disk 1 is the direct disk , and disk 2 is the inclined one .",
    "only old stars are included in this plot , so the dissipative disk component in the 30% gas remnant is left out .",
    "each disk was partitioned into cylindrical bins containing 300 stars apiece , and the bins were labeled according to which orbital class formed the plurality of stars among those 300 in the final remnant - black for boxes , green for @xmath3tubes , and red for @xmath4tubes .",
    "the bins favoring tube orbits were further labeled based on whether they tended to stream in one direction in the final remnant , or to have canceling rotation .",
    "bins with @xmath166 are indicated with upward - pointing arrows and labeled as `` counterclockwise , '' while those with @xmath167 are indicated with downward - pointing arrows and labeled as `` clockwise .",
    "'' bins with @xmath168 are labeled as `` canceling '' and indicated with filled circles .",
    "the blue circles mark the half - mass radii of the original disks .    in the dissipationless simulation ,",
    "most of the stars within the half - mass radius become box orbits in the final remnant . when a dissipative component is added ( second and third columns ) , the set of stars that became box orbits in the collisionless case instead form a population of @xmath3tube orbits with largely canceling rotation , especially in disk 2 .",
    "it is apparent that this cancellation does _ not _ arise primarily from the ics , since it occurs for stars in the same disk .",
    "note that the spatial boundary of the canceling @xmath3tube population changes little between 15 and 30% gas , suggesting that the boundary is set by a bar formation criterion that determines which orbits `` would have been '' boxes ( e.g. @xcite ) , rather than by the direct gravity of the dissipative component .",
    "the box population might be fully transformed into @xmath3tubes so long as a critical gas mass is exceeded .",
    "it should also be noted that the efficiency with which the gas is torqued inward decreases with increasing @xmath0 , so the cmc mass comprises a smaller fraction of the initial gas mass in higher-@xmath0 remnants ( see figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "stars outside the half - mass radius in disk 1 generally become @xmath3tube orbits in the remnant , with a higher degree of streaming than in the inner parts .",
    "the fate of these stars is relatively insensitive to @xmath0 , though some box orbits from this region in the dissipationless remnant do become @xmath3tubes in the simulations with gas ( compare the top right and top middle panels ) .",
    "the stars originating in the outer part of disk 2 end up in a uniformly streaming @xmath4tube population , irrespective of @xmath0 .",
    "their streaming about the long axis of the remnant can be explained simply in terms of the merger geometry - see e.g. figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the long axis lies in the merger plane , so stars on nearly circular orbits in the outskirts of an inclined disk start out with large tangential velocity components about this axis , and are therefore liable to occupy the @xmath4tube `` start space '' ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the uniform rotation of these orbits in the final remnant suggests that they do not cross orbital boundaries during the merger ; their angular momentum is retained from the initial spin of the inclined disk , and is a direct signature of the dynamically cold nature of the progenitor galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig : disksc ] provides a good example of how orbital classification can isolate sets of stars with similar physical histories .",
    "so far we have focused the discussion on individual remnants ; figure  [ fig : inner ] shows the dependence of the orbital structure on @xmath0 , averaged over all eight merger orbits .",
    "we compute the structural parameters on @xmath6 scales since this radius has been the main focus of triaxial dynamical modeling efforts to date ( e.g. @xcite ) , and defer further discussion of the outer orbital structure to section 3.5 .",
    "as expected from the preceding discussion , the @xmath3tube population increases , the mass in box orbits decreases , and the shapes become rounder and more oblate with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this transformation occurs primarily between 0 and 15% gas . at higher gas fractions the average shapes , box , and @xmath3tube fractions level off , consistent with the `` critical mass '' interpretation of the box orbit suppression .",
    "the apparent break in the trend at 30% gas arises because these remnants are very round . in a remnant that is very nearly spherical",
    ", the distinction between the two classes of tubes is blurred , and the triaxiality parameter and orientation vector are ill - defined ( see e.g. remnant @xmath23 in figure  [ fig : rems30 ] ) .",
    "the 40% gas remnants are slightly more flattened than those at 30% gas , presumably owing to the rotation of the stronger embedded disks .",
    "the stellar component is slightly more flattened than the mass including the dm , particularly at low @xmath0 .",
    "there is a mild downward trend in the population of @xmath4tube orbits with @xmath0 between zero and 15% as the shape of the potential becomes more oblate , but the round potentials at higher gas fractions are slightly more amenable to @xmath4tubes .    at low @xmath0",
    "the @xmath4tube orbits tend to stream far more than the @xmath3tube orbits .",
    "this trend reverses at the highest gas fractions owing to the rapid rotation of the embedded disks , and the direct modification of the gravitational potential by the large cmc , which may blur the lines between @xmath4tube and @xmath3tube orbits as the potential becomes very round .",
    "the streaming of the @xmath4tube orbits might also fall off because of the figure rotation ; the long axis no longer necessarily lies in the merger plane , so more stars may be randomly scattered onto tangential orbits about the long axis .",
    "the exact reason for this trend in the @xmath4tube rotation needs further investigation .",
    "the cancellation of the @xmath3tube rotation is most complete around 10% gas , perhaps because the stronger cmc more efficiently disrupts box orbits than at lower @xmath0 , while at higher @xmath0 the dissipation begins to play a direct role .    in the high-@xmath0 remnants ,",
    "the fraction of box orbits often turns upward in the very center .",
    "this effect is partially hidden in e.g. figure  [ fig : rems40 ] since we started the profiles at the 15th percentile in binding energy .",
    "it can be naturally explained since only the innermost component ( the cmc itself ) contains no smaller cmc , and so can support stable box orbits .",
    "the violent relaxation during the final merger of the two cores provides a natural setting for the onset of triaxiality .",
    "however the box population computed within the central starburst is expected to be highly sensitive to numerical effects , including artificial flattening of the core density profile owing to the gravitational softening , and imprecise centering in the orbital classification , so we chose to omit the very innermost scales from the structural profiles .",
    "the remnants do not typically show large orientation twists within the 50th percentile in binding energy , or @xmath158 ( excluding the kdcs , since the shape may not be well - resolved on such small scales ) .",
    "the low @xmath0 remnants typically have large kinematic misalignments , while the angular momentum of the 40% gas remnants is well aligned with the short axis of the potential .",
    "profiles of the orbital structure , shape , and orientation of all 48 dissipative remnants ( 5 - 40% gas ) are shown in figures  [ fig : rems5 ] to  [ fig : rems40 ] of the appendix .",
    "we have outlined the main trends with @xmath0 in this section , but there is substantial variation in the structural transformations from one merger orbit to the next .",
    "some of the remnants ( @xmath152 and @xmath36 ) are already transformed into oblate , @xmath3tube dominated systems at 5% gas , while others ( e.g. @xmath154 and @xmath169 ) are still box - dominated and substantially prolate at this gas fraction .",
    "remnant @xmath144 is oblate at 0% gas and becomes prolate at 5% gas .",
    "a small gas component transforms remnant @xmath143 from a nearly pure prolate spheroid dominated by @xmath4tube orbits , to a triaxial system with a large @xmath3tube population . as the cmc alters the shape of the potential ,",
    "both directly and indirectly through its interactions with the stars , the phase space boundaries between the orbital classes move .",
    "this shifting of the orbital boundaries can induce further changes in the potential , leading to a cascade effect .",
    "the causes of the more complex orbital transformations in some of the individual remnants are an interesting topic for future study .",
    "the 15 - 40% gas remnants often contain a cold @xmath3tube population that appears as a kdc or embedded disk in @xmath6 velocity maps , similar to the sub - components observed in some of the sauron galaxies @xcite .",
    "this component typically appears as a kdc in the 15 - 20% gas remnants , with a large kinematic twist relative to the stars around @xmath60 .",

    "the outer parts of the kdc remnants show a variety of different types of kinematics , depending of the remnant and projection - some show no rotation ( e.g. column 1 of figure  [ fig : kdcs ] ) , some minor - axis or oblique rotation ( columns 2 and 3 ) , and some a significant amount of major - axis rotation either aligned with or counter to the kdc ( but always less disk - like than the kdc ; e.g. columns 2 and 4 ) . @xmath137 and @xmath133 are always tightly anticorrelated within the kdc , but may have a positive ( columns 2 and 5 ) or weaker negative ( column 4 ) correlation outside the core .",
    "some of the remnants show multiple kinematically distinct parts , e.g. remnant @xmath154 at 20% gas displays minor - axis rotation with @xmath137 and @xmath133 correlated , and major - axis rotation counter to the kdc , with @xmath137 and @xmath133 anticorrelated , at the outer edge of the map .",
    "[ fig : outerpic ]    the cores of the kdc remnants are not nearly as distinct in their underlying orbital structure as they are in their kinematics , as @xcite observed in the dynamical modeling of ngc4365 .",
    "this is because the mass of the streaming population producing the kdc is generally small , and the kdcs consist of an oblate @xmath3tube population on top of a system already oblate and dominated by @xmath3tube orbits because of the strong cmc .",
    "figure  [ fig : kdcspec ] illustrates this point by showing the orbital breakdown of the losvds at three different locations in the kdc remnant depicted in the second column of figure  [ fig : kdcs ] : one within the kdc ( point a ) , one along the major axis outside the kdc , in a region showing no rotation ( point b ) , and one near @xmath60 along the minor axis , in the part dominated by minor - axis rotation ( point c ) .",
    "the orbital population at all three locations is ( perhaps surprisingly ) comprised of roughly the same mixture of @xmath3tube , @xmath4tube , and box orbits , with @xmath3tube orbits always in the majority .",
    "the very different appearance of the three regions in the kinematic map owes to large differences in the degree of orbital streaming - at point a the @xmath3tubes are highly streaming ; the @xmath4tubes are highly streaming at point c ; and at point b both classes of tubes are distributed symmetrically about @xmath41 .",
    "in the 30 - 40% gas remnants , the scale of the disk component is typically large enough to fill most or all of the sauron - scale kinematic maps .",
    "the embedded disk in these remnants is typically quite cold , because the disk stars form in a slow trickle extending over @xmath122 gyrs after the merger @xcite and are therefore subject to very little violent relaxation .",
    "figure  [ fig : disk ] shows remnant @xmath154 at 40% gas , which has one of the strongest embedded disks in our sample , at a viewing angle about 30@xmath170 from edge on . the contribution from old stars , present as collisionless particles in the initial disks ,",
    "is shown in the upper right panel .",
    "when only old stars are included , the maximum velocity on the map drops from 135 to 66 km / s , and the rotation is no longer well - aligned with the major axis .",
    "the old stars do still display more major - axis rotation than most remnants at low @xmath0 , since they also contract and spin up in response to the rapid condensation of the gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lower right panel shows what is left when only the 15% of the new stars that formed _ latest _ ( @xmath125% of the total stellar mass )",
    "are removed .",
    "the maximum velocity still plummets to 72 km / s , and what remains appears similar to a kdc system , since the most recently - formed stars dominate the outer portions of the embedded disk .",
    "the contributions of old and recently - formed stars to a typical losvd near @xmath60 in the embedded disk is shown in the lower right panel .",
    "the stars that formed late have a much smaller velocity dispersion , and when superimposed on the hot old population they yield a velocity distribution strongly skewed opposite the mean velocity ( see also @xcite ) .      we have shown that the outer parts of the remnants ( outside @xmath158 ) are less relaxed than the inner parts , and are largely unaffected by the gas content of the disks ( see figures  [ fig : igfs ] and  [ fig : disksc ] ) . while kinematic maps of gas - rich remnants are dominated by dissipational rotation on 1@xmath7 scales , their kinematics",
    "farther out reflects the `` dry '' part of the merger remnant that is left essentially untouched by the gas , resulting in large kinematic twists between around 1 and 3@xmath7 .",
    "this point is illustrated clearly in figure  [ fig : outerpic ] , which compares velocity maps of remnant @xmath23 at 0 and 40% gas on three different scales , 1 , 3 , and 7@xmath7 , in the same oblique projection .",
    "profiles of the orbital populations are reproduced in the right - hand panel for comparison .",
    "on 1@xmath7 scales the dissipationless and gas - rich remnants look entirely different , the former being a minor - axis rotator while the latter is dominated by rapid disk - like rotation .",
    "however when we zoom out to 3@xmath7 , the similarity in their outer structure becomes apparent .",
    "the gas has thoroughly transformed the inner part of the 40% gas remnant , while the outer parts are left as they were in the dissipationless case .",
    "the same observation can be made from the orbital profiles - the orbital populations outside @xmath158 are similar in the 0 and 40% gas remnants , but are radically different within @xmath60 , where the dissipationless remnant is comprised mostly of box orbits and the 40% gas remnant is dominated by @xmath3tubes .",
    "the similarity in the outer kinematic maps is even more apparent on 7@xmath7 scales .",
    "sharp kinematic and orbital transitions such as those in figure  [ fig : outerpic ] will be clearly observable in new surveys such as smeagol , probing the stellar orbital structure out to @xmath16 scales @xcite , or the pn.s survey , probing the kinematics out to @xmath171 scales using planetary nebulae as tracers @xcite .",
    "predictions for the statistics of kinematic twists and abrupt changes in the rotation parameter , @xmath172 @xcite , in such surveys will be further discussed and quantified in @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic outer structure of the remnants is summarized in figure  [ fig : outer ] , which is the same as figure  [ fig : inner ] but for the structure between @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the orbital populations , shapes , and orbital streaming are far less sensitive to @xmath0 than in the inner parts .",
    "the outer stellar population is dominated by tube orbits , as expected given the steep effective density profile at these radii , with a roughly even mix of @xmath4tubes and @xmath3tubes .",
    "the exchange between box and @xmath3tube orbits with increasing @xmath0 is still noticeable , though diminished . from visual inspection of some randomly selected orbits ,",
    "box orbits in the halo tend to be more stochastic and spherical in shape @xcite , and we will further investigate the nature of the outer box orbits in future work .",
    "both classes of tubes have a higher rotation bias than in the inner parts .",
    "the @xmath4tube orbits are especially highly streaming , which is a signature of the stars dynamically cold origin . to highlight this point ,",
    "we have also plotted the streaming fraction of the @xmath4tube and @xmath3tube orbits over the same range of relative binding energies for a series of re - mergers of the 20 and 40% gas remnants ( see @xcite ) , intended to represent `` dry '' mergers between elliptical galaxies that have already exhausted their gas in a previous major merger ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the streaming of the @xmath3tubes is not that much different in the remnants of mergers between dynamically hot ellipticals than in the disk mergers , but the @xmath4tube orbits show far less ordered rotation in the dry merger remnants . in a merger between hot systems ,",
    "the random motions of the stars provide a source of initial angular momentum about the long axis , with no preferred sense of rotation .",
    "the uniform streaming of the outer @xmath4tube orbits might be a tell - tale sign of a cold ( late - type ) progenitor in dynamical models of observed systems .",
    "the shapes of the matter distribution between 3 and 7@xmath7 are round ( @xmath150 on average ) , and nearly maximally triaxial .",
    "the stars are substantially more flattened ( @xmath175 ) and oblate ( @xmath176 ) than the matter as a whole ( including dm ) .",
    "large kinematic misalignments are common in the outer parts , producing large kinematic twists between @xmath121 and 3@xmath7 in the most gas - rich remnants , as shown previously in figure  [ fig : outerpic ] .",
    "the 30 - 40% gas remnants also typically have large instrinsic orientation twists between @xmath121 and 5@xmath7 , owing to the rapid figure rotation of the inner component .",
    "we have shown that a variety of observed kinematic structures can be accounted for just by varying the gas fraction in binary 1:1 mergers .",
    "the projected kinematics within 1@xmath7 tends to fall into one of four categories : ( i ) rapid disk - like rotation about the major axis ; ( ii ) a prominent , disk - like kdc with slow or minor - axis rotation farther out ; ( iii ) uniform slow rotation , with @xmath177 km / s ; and ( iv ) prominent minor axis rotation , with little or no rotation about the major axis . in figure",
    "[ fig : kinclass ] we classify the eight remnants at each @xmath0 into these four categories based on visual inspection of their velocity maps in projection along the @xmath35axis ( intrinsic variations far outweigh projection effects in the global appearance of the kinematic maps ) .",
    "the 0 - 10% gas remnants are generally slowly rotating or dominated by minor - axis rotation , in agreement with the previous results of @xcite .",
    "the 15 - 20% gas remnants often look similar to the lower-@xmath0 remnants but with disk - like kdcs at their centers , and bear an interesting resemblance to observed galaxies such as ngc4365 @xcite , ngc5813 , and ngc4458 @xcite .",
    "the 30 - 40% gas remnants generically show rapid , disk - like rotation with @xmath178 up to @xmath11 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "none of them display the extreme rotation ( @xmath179 ) of the most rapid rotators in the sauron sample , although other studies @xcite have shown that 1:1 mergers between 60 - 80% gas disks can yield higher values of @xmath178 .",
    "high @xmath180 values are always accompanied by high , anticorrelated @xmath137 values in our remnants , so the subset of sauron rapid rotators with a shallow @xmath181 relation may require a different formation mechanism .",
    "the variety of features that can be produced with 1:1 mergers alone suggests that there are degeneracies in the formation scenarios leading to a given gross outcome .",
    "for instance cold embedded disks can arise either from gas - rich merging or from cosmological gas inflow and secular evolution @xcite .",
    "lower progenitor mass ratios ( @xmath173 - 4:1 instead of 1:1 mergers ) can produce remnants resembling many sauron rapid rotators even in dissipationless simulations @xcite .",
    "sequential minor mergers can produce slowly rotating ellipticals as well as major mergers with low @xmath0 , that are in better agreement with observed round , isotropic , and featureless systems such as ngc4486 , ngc4552 , and ngc 5846 @xcite .",
    "these scenarios must be distinguished with more detailed structural and dynamical analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our orbital analysis suggests a rather simple picture of how the structure of the remnants arises .",
    "non - axisymmetric torques in the merger trigger the formation of a triaxial structure with a large population of box orbits . when gas is present , the strong cmc formed through dissipation ( e.g. @xcite ) converts the majority of the box population into @xmath3tube orbits , which have nearly canceling rotation since box diffusion has no preferred direction .",
    "stars in inclined disks begin with a large polar angular momentum component ( @xmath182 ) that is retained throughout the merger , so they do not cross orbital boundaries .",
    "this produces a streaming @xmath4tube population in the remnants , that is most pronounced at large radii .",
    "this picture of the @xmath4tube population is supported by the facts that ( i ) co - planar mergers produce remnants almost entirely devoid of @xmath4tube orbits ; ( ii ) the phase space available to @xmath4tubes in the remnant potentials is generally underpopulated @xcite ; and ( iii ) in some observed ellipticals the velocity ellipsoid is flattened along the polar axis @xcite .    in gas - rich merger remnants",
    ", there is also a pronounced streaming @xmath3tube population on small scales owing to the gas that dissipates energy and retains its angular momentum during the merger @xcite . outside a fairly well - defined boundary ( see e.g. figures  [ fig : disksc ] and  [ fig : outerpic ] ) , the orbital structure is largely unaffected by the gas .",
    "this boundary corresponds to the radius where box orbits cease to dominate in the dissipationless remnants , implying that these regions may be left relatively intact because they have never had a large population of radial orbits to convey information about the galactic center to their location .",
    "time - dependent orbital classification and idealized evolving models are needed to verify this interpretation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic orbital structure arising from this picture , and in particular the sharp kinematic transitions predicted between @xmath11 and @xmath63 , should be readily observable with surveys in progress such as smeagol .",
    "some pronounced kinematic transitions have been observed around these radii in survey pilot studies @xcite , but more data will be needed to determine whether these transitions are of the same nature as those in the merger simulations . note that some features , e.g. the uniform streaming of the @xmath4tube orbits , can only be captured with dynamical modeling - substantial minor - axis rotation alone could be produced by either a dominant population of @xmath4tubes with a small rotation bias , or a smaller , highly streaming population .",
    "we do not necessarily expect most real galaxies to display the sharp features in their orbital structure found in this paper , since cosmological galaxy formation histories are far more complex than isolated 1:1 mergers between pure disks .",
    "however the results of our analysis illustrate how orbital analysis can isolate subsets of the stellar population with similar histories and place intuitive constraints on galaxy formation mechanisms .",
    "in future work we hope to extend this type of analysis to a broader range of merger parameters and more complex cosmological formation scenarios .",
