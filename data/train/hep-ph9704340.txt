    "quark confinement is one of the main ploblems that should be solved in hadronic physics .",
    "the linear potential between quark and anti - quark at long distance can be calculated by monte carlo calculations of lattice qcd and the non - relativistic quark potential model explain the low - lying hadron spectrum with the infinitely rising potentials.@xcite    quark potentials in multi - hadron system should also be investigated .",
    "a difficulty appears when one try to understand multi - hadron systems in the framework of linear rising quark potential model .",
    "it gives a long - range attraction , called color van der waals force , between two color - singlet hadrons which seems to contradict experimental data of nucleon - nucleon scattering.@xcite    in treating multi - hadron system , the string flip model was proposed phenomenologically.@xcite   in the string flip model , hadrons do not interact each other except when the strings flip into another combination .",
    "hence the string flip model is by construction free from color van der waals force .",
    "but it is not so straightforward to understand the string flip model starting from qcd .",
    "dual ginzburg - landau ( dgl ) theory is an infrared effective theory of quark confinement derived from qcd.@xcite   thooft and mandelstam conjectured that qcd vacuum may be dual to superconductor and that monopoles play the analogous role of cooper pairs in qcd.@xcite thooft proposed abelian projection to extract relevant dynamical variable at low energy in qcd and suggested that the variable is color magnetic monopole.@xcite the abelian projection is a prescription of partial gauge fixing which reduces @xmath1 gauge group to @xmath2 and monopoles appear as a point like singularity .",
    "following bardacki and samuel we can integrate out monopole trajectories.@xcite   introducing dual vector gauge fields,@xcite   we can get dual ginzburg - landau lagrangian that is an abelian effective theory with magnetic monopoles .",
    "meson , baryon and spin - dependent baryon potentials have been calculated numerically in dgl theory.@xcite   the model also explains the characteristic features of finite - temperature transition of pure qcd found by lattice calculations .",
    "@xcite   monopole condensation and chiral symmetry breaking is also discussed.@xcite    in this paper , we treat multi - hadron system ( for simplicity meson - meson system ) in dgl theory .",
    "we numerically solve classical equations of motion derived from dgl theory and obtain static potentials @xmath3 in two body systems and @xmath4 in four body systems .",
    "inter - meson potential is evaluated from @xmath5 .",
    "we also compare our results from dgl theory with those from lattice monte carlo calculations done by green et al .. @xcite",
    "dgl theory is represented by a lagrangian @xmath6 with the constraint @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dual abelian vector field with respect to @xmath9@xmath10@xmath9 and @xmath11 are the complex scalar monopole fields which couple to @xmath12 covariantly under magnetic @xmath9@xmath10@xmath9.@xcite   here @xmath13 are the root vectors : @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an arbitrary constant four vector and @xmath18 is an external color - electric current .",
    "we have already assumed monopole condensation and abelian dominance@xcite  which is supported by monte carlo simulations of qcd.@xcite   it is noted that this form is just dual to relativistic ginzburg - landau theory with an external magnetic current .",
    "we consider for simplicity the following symmetric configurations of four static quarks in three dimensional space : @xmath19 where @xmath20 here color - electric coupling @xmath21 is related to @xmath22 by dirac quantization condition @xmath23 .",
    "we now look for static solutions in which the time components are neglected . adopting a unitary gauge @xmath24 ,",
    "we get equations of motion : @xmath25 @xmath26 the energy density @xmath27 is written as @xmath28 here the color - electric field is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the singular string field which vanishes everywhere except on the dirac strings .",
    "it comes from the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1s2 ] ) .",
    "if we require @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the spatial infinity , our gauge choice makes the @xmath33 field vanish at this region as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1s4 ] ) .",
    "this means that the string singularity does not extend to infinity but connects the quark charges in the unitary gauge .",
    "there are various ways to connect the charges .    here",
    "we consider the dirac quantization condition which guarantees unobservability of the string .",
    "we can change the string location by a single - valued gauge transformation , if the integral of the dual vector field along an infinitesimal closed loop is quantized as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integer and @xmath36 [ eqn:1s1 ] is used .",
    "condition ( [ eqn:1s8 ] ) selects two - type configurations of the dirac string ( figs .  1  ( a )  ( b ) ) out of those which connect the charges ( figs .  1  ( a ) ,  ( b )   ( c ) ) .",
    "note that in the unitary gauge the location of the color - electric flux coincides with that of the dirac string where the value of the monopole fields @xmath37 vanishes .    from @xmath38",
    "it is expected that there exists a solution satisfying @xmath39 . then",
    "two equations of ( [ eqn:1s5 ] ) @xmath40 become identical , so that we get the same solution for @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "moreover we can solve the remaining equation of ( [ eqn:1s5 ] ) @xmath44 with the condition that the static energy is minimized : @xmath45 to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eqn:1s4 ] ) and ( [ eqn:1s5 ] ) numerically , we have to avoid infinite quantities such as the string singularities .",
    "following ball and caticha,@xcite   we separate @xmath46 here @xmath47 represents the coulomb field generated by the four charges . in the case of ( a ) type string location in fig .",
    "1 , it is written as @xmath48 where the notation is explained in fig .  2  .",
    "the new fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 are well behaved everywhere .",
    "the field equations are reduced to @xmath51 eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1s10 ] ) not only eliminates the singularities from the equations for @xmath52 but also enables a separation of the infinite coulomb self - energy .",
    "the static potential energy in four body system without the self - energy is given by @xmath53 as the boundary condition at the space - like infinity , we have required @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this means the vacuum of the dual superconductor is realized at the infinite boundary .",
    "the static potential @xmath56 in two body system can be evaluated in a similar way .",
    "finally we get inter - meson potential @xmath57 using the equation @xmath58",
    "as we treat the system numerically , we rescale the variables as @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    the spatial boundary conditions are imposed on the surface of sufficiently large but finite volume .",
    "since the system has ( anti)symmetries under @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 , we can restrict ourselves to the region ( @xmath64 ) with the appropriate continuity conditions .",
    "the region is discretized into an @xmath65 lattice .",
    "since a fine lattice is not needed near the boundary surface , we have used lattices whose lattice spacing becomes larger as the distance from the quark sources . we have used the gauss - seidel method applying the successive overrelaxation technique .",
    "furthermore , we have adopted the following procedure to get rapid convergence .",
    "we work first on a coarse lattice and next employ the solution as the intial configuration on a finer lattice which is constructed by putting new sites between the original lattice sites . and",
    "we repeat this process .",
    "the largest values of @xmath66 , and @xmath67 attained are 80 , 120 and 120 , respectively .",
    "the procedure of changing the lattice size shows us the lattice spacing dependence of the energy @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is nicely fitted by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a typical lattice spacing .",
    "this dependence gives the continuum limit of the energy .",
    "varying the inter - quark distances @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we get the potential @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we first illustrate the results of the inter - quark potential . as shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "inter - quark potential in dgl theory is yukawa - like in the short distance and linear in the long distance .",
    "dgl theory realizes quark confinement .    to compare our results based on dgl theory with those from @xmath72 lattice qcd calculation obtained by green et al.,@xcite  we study the @xmath72 case . in @xmath72 case ,",
    "( [ eqn:1s12 ] ) and ( [ eqn:1s13 ] ) are almost the same as in @xmath1 case except that the coupling @xmath73 is replaced by @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1s13 ] ) .",
    "the four quark potential is modified into @xmath75 our results in @xmath1 case is qualitatively similar to those in @xmath72 case . to compare these results",
    ", we have to adjust the parameters in both results .",
    "free parameters are @xmath76 in dgl theory and @xmath77 which is the lattice spacing at @xmath78 in @xmath72 lattice qcd .",
    "inter - quark potential @xmath56 calculated numerically in dgl theory gives the scaled string tension @xmath79 , whereas lattice @xmath72 qcd monte carlo simulation gives the scaled string tension @xmath80.@xcite   the string tension @xmath81 determines @xmath82 and @xmath77 to be 175.567(3 ) mev and 0.1179 fm , respectively .",
    "because all charged gluons as well as neutral gluons contribute equally in the short distance , the coulomb term of @xmath83 in dgl theory@xcite   should be equal to one third of the term @xmath84 derived from the lattice data .",
    "hence we set @xmath85 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the qcd vacuum is near the border between type 1 and 2 .",
    "hence we take @xmath86 in accordance with the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath87 .",
    "now we can calculate the inter - meson potential .",
    "we consider both cases of dirac string location ( fig .  1 ( a ) and ( b ) ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1s15 ] ) we evaluate the inter - meson potential @xmath88 in both cases and choose the lower one . in fig .",
    "4 the results are shown when @xmath70 is fixed .",
    "two mesons hardly interact each other in the region @xmath89 . but as two mesons are getting closer , interaction between them becomes sizable at some value of @xmath71 .",
    "the maximally interacting point is just the square ( @xmath90 ) point . still decreasing @xmath71",
    "makes dirac strings flip to take the holizontal direction and the interaction gets weaker .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the ansatz made in the string flip model.@xcite    to see whether these inter - meson potentials in dgl theory are long - range or short - range , @xmath88 in the region @xmath91 is fitted by the function @xmath92 when @xmath93 fm .",
    "this function reproduces well the data when @xmath94  gev and  @xmath95 .",
    "so the inter - meson potential in dgl theory is short - range .    when @xmath70 is taken larger , the peak value of interaction becomes smaller ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "the case @xmath90 is shown in fig",
    ".  6 . in fig",
    ".  7 we also show the potential in the case that dirac strings run in the same direction . in this case",
    "the inter - meson potential is repulsive as expected .",
    "we also compare our results with those from lattice qcd .@xcite both results are similar qualitatively as seen from figs .  4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "the degree of falling at @xmath96 in dgl theory is a little weaker than that in lattice qcd .",
    "this difference may come from the assumption that we have neglected the off - diagonal gluons whose contribution is sizable in the short distance .    in fig .",
    "8 the color electric flux distribution is shown .",
    "the color electric flux spreads in all direction in coulomb phase @xmath97 , while it is squeezed between quarks which belong to the same meson in the confinement phase @xmath98 .",
    "this illustrates the interactions between mesons are short - range .",
    "thus dgl theory reproduces both properties of quark confinement and asymptotic separability of mesons at the classical level .",
    "the potentials in dgl theory is linear in the color electric flux direction , whereas yukawa - like short - range in the direction perpendicular to the flux .    recently",
    "an attempt to determine the couplings in the abelian effective monopole action has been performed .",
    "monopole action can be derived numerically from the monopole current configurations given after abelian projection on the lattice.@xcite   this action is equivalent to non - compact abelian higgs action on the dual lattice in the long - range region.@xcite   it is very interesting to fix the couplings in dgl theory directly from qcd .",
