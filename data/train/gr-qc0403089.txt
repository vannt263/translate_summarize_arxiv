    "an exact solution of einstein s equations is known @xcite , @xcite which describes an impulsive spherical gravitational wave in a minkowski background that is generated by a snapping infinite cosmic string ( or by an expanding string inside the sphere @xcite ) .",
    "this solution can be obtained either @xcite by pasting two appropriate forms of minkowski space either side of the spherical wavefront , or @xcite as a limiting case of particular solutions with boost - rotation symmetry ( see also @xcite@xcite ) . in both constructions ,",
    "the two ends of the semi - infinite strings recede from a common point generating an impulsive spherical wave .",
    "( alternatively , there is an expanding cosmic string along the axis of symmetry separating the two particles . ) however , as already pointed out @xcite , this solution does not strictly describe a snapping cosmic string , but rather two semi - infinite cosmic strings which initially approach at the speed of light and then separate again at the instant at which they collide .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present and investigate an analogous solution which describes a snapping cosmic string in a de  sitter or anti - de  sitter universe , thus generating an impulsive spherical wave in either of these backgrounds .",
    "in fact , a general method for constructing expanding impulsive spherical gravitational waves in a minkowski background had previously been suggested by penrose @xcite .",
    "this involves cutting minkowski space - time along a null cone and then re - attaching the two pieces with a suitable `` warp '' .",
    "the explicit general solution written in a continuous coordinate system is given in @xcite@xcite .",
    "this , of course , includes the solution which describes a snapping cosmic string as a particular case .",
    "this general family of solutions has also been extended to include a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these solutions describe a family of expanding spherical gravitational waves in a de  sitter or anti - de  sitter universe . in this paper",
    ", we identify the specific solution which represents a snapping cosmic string in these backgrounds . before presenting this",
    ", however , we first describe an instructive geometrical representation of a cosmic string in the ( anti-)de  sitter background .",
    "further , the general class of solutions of this type has been shown @xcite to be equivalent to impulsive limits of the class of robinson  trautman type  n solutions . in section  4",
    ", we will present the exact solution for a snapping string in this context . in section  5",
    ", we will demonstrate how this solution can also be obtained as a limit of the c - metric which can be interpreted as the field of two black holes accelerating away from each other under the action of strings which pull in opposite directions . in the limit",
    "as the acceleration @xmath1 becomes unbounded while the mass @xmath2 of the black holes is reduced to zero keeping the quantity @xmath3 constant , this reduces exactly to the solution for a snapping cosmic string . for a minkowski background",
    ", this procedure is known  @xcite .",
    "however , the method applied there can not be extended to the case when the cosmological constant is non - zero as no global coordinate system ( analogous to that for the weyl coordinates ) is known for this case . a different method is therefore developed in section  5 in which the solution for a snapping cosmic string in a de  sitter or anti - de  sitter background can be derived as the limit of the generalization of the c - metric which contains a cosmological constant .",
    "as is well known , the de  sitter and anti - de  sitter space - times can be represented as the 4-dimensional hyperboloid @xmath4 in the flat 5-dimensional space @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the sign of @xmath0 , @xmath8 is a constant , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related to standard cartesian coordinates by @xmath11 and @xmath12 . when @xmath13 and @xmath14 , this is a complete de  sitter space in which , at any time @xmath15 const .",
    ", the universe is closed and has the geometry of a 3-sphere . when @xmath16 , a wedge in the space - time is missing , and the de  sitter space may be considered to include a string with a deficit angle @xmath17 located along the line @xmath18 .",
    "it may immediately be observed from ( [ hyp ] ) that the string lies on a closed meridian around the universe . as the universe contracts ( for @xmath19 ) and then expands ( for @xmath20 ) , the length of the string also correspondingly contracts and expands .",
    "analogously , when @xmath13 and @xmath21 , this is the complete open anti - de  sitter space .",
    "when @xmath16 , a wedge in the space - time is missing , and the space may be considered to include an infinite string with a deficit angle @xmath17 located along the line @xmath18 .    it will be shown in the following sections that the ends of a snapped cosmic string in both the de  sitter and the anti - de  sitter universe propagate along the null generators of the hyperboloid which are located on the section @xmath22 which corresponds to the poles of an expanding sphere on which @xmath23 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  1 . in the de  sitter case ,",
    "the string is contained in the region for which @xmath24 , but is absent for @xmath25 .",
    "however , for @xmath21 , the string is contained in the region for which @xmath25 , and is absent for @xmath24 . for @xmath26 , such a situation can be formally represented by the line element @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the heaviside step function .",
    "however , the metric ( [ discont ] ) does not correspond to a global solution of einstein s equations .",
    "the discontinuity across  @xmath22  must be accompanied by an impulsive component which can be interpreted as an expanding spherical gravitational wave .",

    "thus , the expressions ( [ exp1 ] ) and ( [ exp2 ] ) correspond to expansions about opposite poles of the spherical wave surfaces . in order to maintain a continuous coordinate system ,",

    "in fact , it can be seen from figure  2 that the foliation of the space - time in either regions @xmath80 or @xmath78 by the null cones @xmath72  const .",

    "this procedure leads to a metric form which is discontinuous over the spherical wavefront @xmath83 generated by the snapping string .",

    "these solutions are regular and well behaved everywhere .",
    "it is then very reasonable to investigate these solutions in the limit as the duration of the wave becomes arbitrarily small .",
    "such a limit leads unambiguously to an expression for a spherical impulsive gravitational wave , but the metric again becomes discontinuous and is exactly the null limit of the c - metric described above .    in section  3 , we used the `` cut and paste '' method as another way to construct spherical impulsive waves . here",
    ", we presented a solution in which the metric is explicitly continuous and also valid for all possible values of the cosmological constant and the parameter  @xmath34 .",
    "these provide an alternative form of the above solutions for a snapping string together with an expanding impulse .",
    "we have indicated how this form of the metric is related to the 5-dimensional representation of the background de  sitter and anti - de  sitter universes .    when @xmath170 , the null limit of the c - metric was previously derived in an explicitly continuous form  @xcite .",
    "this could be achieved because a global coordinate system adapted to the boost - rotation symmetry was available",
