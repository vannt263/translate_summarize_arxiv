    "it is well - known that the natural functor from the category of associative algebras to that of lie algebras and the adjoint functor play a fundamental role in the study of these algebraic structures and their applications .",
    "this paper establishes a similar relationship between rota - baxter algebras and dendriform dialgebras and dendriform trialgebras by using free rota - baxter algebras .",
    "a rota - baxter algebra is an algebra @xmath0 with a linear endomorphism @xmath1 satisfying the * rota - baxter equation * :    @xmath2    here @xmath3 is a fixed element in the base ring and is sometimes denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "this equation was introduced by the mathematician glen e. baxter   in 1960 in his probability study , and was popularized mainly by the work of gian - carlo rota   and his school .",
    "linear operators satisfying equation ( ) in the context of lie algebras were introduced independently by belavin and drinfeld , and semenov - tian - shansky   in the 1980s and were related to solutions , called @xmath5-matrices , of the ( modified ) classical yang - baxter equation , named after the physicists chen - ning yang and rodney baxter .",
    "recently , there have been several interesting developments of rota - baxter algebras in theoretical physics and mathematics , including quantum field theory  , yang - baxter equations  , shuffle products  , operads  , hopf algebras  , combinatorics   and number theory  .",
    "the most prominent of these is the work   of connes and kreimer in their hopf algebraic approach to renormalization theory in perturbative quantum field theory , continued in a series of papers .",
    "a dendriform dialgebra is a module @xmath6 with two binary operations @xmath7 and @xmath8 that satisfy three relations between them ( see eq .",
    "this concept was introduced by loday   in 1995 with motivation from algebraic @xmath9-theory , and was further studied in connection with several areas in mathematics and physics , including operads  , homology  , hopf algebras  , lie and leibniz algebras  , combinatorics  , arithmetic   and quantum field theory  .",
    "a few years later loday and ronco defined dendriform trialgebras in their study   of polytopes and koszul duality .",
    "such a structure is a module @xmath10 equipped with binary operations @xmath11 and @xmath12 that satisfy seven relations that will be recalled in eq .",
    "( ) .    the dendriform dialgebra and trialgebra share the property that the sum of the binary operations @xmath13 ( for dialgebra ) or @xmath14 ( for trialgebra ) is associative .",
    "other dendriform algebra structures have the similar property of  splitting associativity \" in the sense that an associative product decomposes into a linear combination of several binary operations .",
    "many such structures have been obtained lately , such as the quadri - algebra of loday and aguiar   and the ennea- and ns - algebra of leroux  . in ( see also ) , we showed how these more complex structures , equipped with large numbers of compositions and relations , can be derived from an operadic point of view in terms of products .",
    "further examples and developments can be found in  .",
    "the first link between rota - baxter algebras and dendriform algebras was given by aguiar   who showed that a rota - baxter algebra of weight @xmath15 carries a dendriform dialgebra structure , resembling the lie algebra structure on an associative algebra .",
    "this has been extended to further connections between linear operators and dendriform type algebras  , in particular to dendriform trialgebras by the first named author .",
    "see theorem   for details .    consequently , there are natural functors from the category of rota - baxter algebras of weight @xmath3 to the categories of dendriform dialgebras and trialgebras .",
    "we study the adjoint functors in this paper .    as a preparation ,",
    "we first construct in section   free rota - baxter algebras ( theorem  ) which play a central role in the study of the adjoint functors .",
    "this is in analogy to the central role played by the free associative algebras in the study of the adjoint functor from the category of lie algebras to the category of associative algebras .",
    "as we will see , free rota - baxter algebras can be defined in various generalities , such as over a set or over another algebra , in various contexts , such as unitary or nonunitary algebras , and they can be constructed in various terms , such as by words or by trees , either explicitly or recursively . for the purpose of our application to adjoint functors ,",
    "we only consider a special case of free rota - baxter algebras , namely free nonunitary rota - baxter algebras @xmath16 generated by another algebra @xmath0 that possesses a basis over the base ring .",
    "further studies of free rota - baxter algebras can be found in  .",
    "then in section , we use these free rota - baxter algebras to obtain adjoint functors of the functors from rota - baxter algebras to dendriform dialgebras ( theorem  ) and trialgebras ( theorem  ) by proving the existence of the corresponding universal enveloping rota - baxter algebras . in the case of dendriform trialgebras , let @xmath17 be a dendriform trialgebra . let @xmath18 be the free nonunitary rota - baxter algebra over the nonunitary algebra @xmath19 constructed in theorem  .",
    "let @xmath20 be a suitable rota - baxter ideal of @xmath18 generated by relations from @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "theorem   shows that the quotient rota - baxter algebra @xmath21 is the universal enveloping rota - baxter algebra of @xmath6 in the sense of definition  .",
    "the special case of free dendriform algebras is considered in section   where we realize the free dendriform dialgebra and trialgebra of loday and loday - ronco in terms of decorated planar rooted trees as canonical subalgebras of free rota - baxter algebras .",
