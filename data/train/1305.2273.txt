    "the formation of stars in a gas cloud is a problem of extraordinary physical complexity , remaining one of the major open problems in modern astrophysics .",
    "a way to constrain this fundamental issue is to examine the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , i.e. the distribution of the masses of stars at birth .",
    "the imf has critical implications in the framework of galaxy formation and evolution , as it sets the overall mass - scale of galactic systems , controls the intensity of the stellar feedback processes and drives the chemical enrichment abundance patterns .    to date",
    ", the imf can only be directly constrained from star number counts in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "current observations are consistent with a universal kroupa / chabrier - type imf , i.e. a power - law behaviour at high mass ( @xmath13m@xmath14 ) with a turn - off at lower masses @xcite , although with a significant uncertainty in the region at masses around a few tenths of m@xmath14 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , the low - mass portion of the imf is extremely important because the mass fraction in stars below @xmath15m@xmath14 varies from @xmath16 for a kroupa imf up to @xmath17 for a @xcite imf , i.e. a large mass fraction of a stellar population is indeed expected in the form of low - mass stars .",
    "an indirect method to study the imf involves the use of dynamical modelling techniques to constrain the total and stellar mass - to - light ratios of a stellar system .",
    "these techniques have been applied to star clusters , favouring a kroupa - like imf ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in early - type galaxies ( hereafter etgs ) , detailed dynamical modelling of the kinematic properties in a nearby sample revealed a systematic increase in the stellar @xmath12 with galaxy mass @xcite , a result confirmed over a 260-strong sample of etgs from the atlas@xmath18 survey @xcite , where the trend is expected to evolve from a kroupa imf at low velocity dispersion ( @xmath19kms@xmath3 ) towards a salpeter function at @xmath20kms@xmath3 .",
    "independent dynamical studies have arrived at similar conclusions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "strong gravitational lensing over galaxy scales can also be exploited to derive stellar @xmath12 especially when the einstein radius only extends over the central regions , where dark matter does not complicate the issue of transforming total into stellar @xmath12 . although strong lensing studies of low - mass spheroids rejected a salpeter imf @xcite , recent work covering a wider range of galaxy mass hinted at systematic variations towards higher stellar @xmath12 with increasing mass  @xcite .",
    "hence , both lensing and dynamical studies require a scenario consistent with either a bottom- or a top - heavier imf than kroupa / chabrier in massive etgs .",
    "in fact , a stellar population can have large @xmath12 because of a large fraction of either low - mass stars or remnants of massive stars , and neither dynamical nor lensing modelling is capable of distinguishing between the two  @xcite .    a unique opportunity to investigate more directly the imf",
    "is offered by gravity - sensitive features in the integrated light of unresolved stellar populations , as originally proposed by  @xcite .",
    "some of the most discriminant features include the nai doublet feature at @xmath21  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nai8200 ) , the wing - ford feh band @xcite at @xmath22 , prominent in the atmospheres of low - mass dwarves , as well as the ca triplet lines at @xmath23(hereafter cat ; see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , which are strong in giants , while barely detectable in dwarves .",
    "several other features , mostly related to na , ca , and tio lines , have been also identified in the literature , as potentially useful tools to constrain the dwarf / giant ratio ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter stk12 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "another potentially useful tool is the analysis of ( optical - nir ) broad - band colours  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "etgs offer a unique opportunity to study the imf , as they host homogeneous , old , stellar populations , with little amount of dust , allowing for a clean analysis of their stellar content .",
    "nevertheless , this kind of analysis is far from being trivial .",
    "all dwarf / giant sensitive features represent a contribution at the level of a few percent to the total galaxy flux , and these features are also sensitive to age , metallicity , as well as abundance ratio of ( several ) chemical elements .",
    "moreover , nir features , like nai8200 and cat , fall in a spectral region often severely contaminated by sky emission and telluric absorption .",
    "these problems have hampered the use of gravity - sensitive features to investigate the imf for a long time .",
    "the first observational attempts to constrain the giant / dwarf ratio in the imf were made by  @xcite and  @xcite , towards the centres of m31 and m32 , using the nai8200 feature .",
    "later , @xcite extended the study to a sample of massive etgs , and found that nai8200 was enhanced , especially in massive galaxies , with strong radial gradients .",
    "these studies concluded in favour of an excess of dwarves ( relative to giants ) in the galaxy central regions .",
    "opposite conclusions were drawn by  @xcite and  @xcite , based on nai8200a , cat , and the wing - ford band , who explained the radial variation and central strength of these features as a metallicity ( rather than imf ) effect .",
    "all these early works were in fact plagued by many difficulties , in particular , small sample sizes , low signal - to - noise ratio and resolution of the spectra , or uncertainties in the available stellar population models .",
    "the recent availability of dedicated instrumentation and sophisticated reduction techniques has opened up new opportunities to exploit the constraining power of ( nir ) imf - sensitive features , by means of high - quality spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite proposed a trend towards an excess of low - mass stars in massive galaxies , from a study of the cat region .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the nai8200a and wing - ford band to conclude that the imf is bottom - heavier than a kroupa / chabrier distribution in a sample of eight massive etgs in the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "this result has been confirmed , using ( theoretical ) stellar population models with varying element abundance ratios and a full spectral fitting analysis by  @xcite , and further extended to a set of 34 etgs from the sauron survey @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "stk12 and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fld13 ) have gone beyond a simple test of universality for the imf , analyzing large samples of etgs drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , focusing on na and tio spectral features .",
    "remarkably , fld13 relied on completely independent stellar population models with respect to  @xcite , using the miuscat  @xcite spectrally extended version of the stellar population synthesis models miles  @xcite .",
    "although all these studies favour a non - universal imf , with more massive etgs harbouring bottom - heavier distributions than kroupa / chabrier , the debate lingers on .",
    "in fact , a different picture has been proposed whereby the variation of spectral features with galaxy mass in etgs is driven by a change of single element ( mostly na and ca ) abundance patterns , rather than an imf variation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . according to this interpretation , for instance",
    ", the nai8200 ( cat ) line strength would increase ( decrease ) with galaxy mass because of an over-(under-)abundance of na ( ca ) relative to mg in more massive systems . as shown by  @xcite , a way out to break the degeneracy is by combining spectral features sensitive to imf with those more sensitive to the abundance of single chemical species . to this effect one has to rely on theoretical models , rather than fully empirical stellar population libraries , to model the impact of variations in both imf and abundance ratio , over a wide range of wavelength .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider simultaneously a variety of spectral features from different chemical species .    in this paper , we follow this approach . we extend our previous work ( fld13 ) , analyzing stacked spectra of @xmath24 nearby ( @xmath25 ) etgs with exceptionally high s / n - ratio , spanning a wide range of central velocity dispersion , from @xmath26 to @xmath27kms@xmath3 . as in fld13",
    ", we mainly rely on extended miles ( miuscat ) state - of - the - art stellar population models for the analysis .",
    "the main novelties of the present contribution are the following : ( i ) we adopt a wide set of spectral indices ( with respect to , e.g. , stk12 and fld13 ) , fitting several tio , ca , and na features simultaneously , to constrain the imf ; ( ii ) we combine age , metallicity , imf- and abundance - sensitive features in the analysis ; ( iii ) we use a semi - empirical technique to correct spectral indices to solar - scale , hence allowing for a clean comparison to the base ( nearly solar - scaled ) models and avoiding to rely completely on theoretical models ; ( iv ) we adopt a wide set of fitting techniques , including a pure spectral index fitting approach , and a hybrid approach , where direct spectral fitting is combined to the constraints from imf - sensitive indices ( as in fld13 ) ; ( v ) we allow for a wide range of star - formation histories , including one- and two - simple stellar populations ( hereafter ssp ) , as well as exponentially declining star - formation models .",
