    "this motivated the study of second - order correlations , initiated by the intensity - correlation experiments conducted by hanbury - brown and twiss @xcite .",
    "subsequently , second - order correlation measurements have found applications in many fields of modern physics @xcite such as astronomy @xcite , optics @xcite , high - energy physics @xcite , condensed matter physics @xcite and atomic physics @xcite .",
    "next to the characterization of a physical system via higher - order correlations , it has also been suggested to use strongly correlated particles or even entangled particles as input to a system for various applications , with the most obvious examples of quantum computation , quantum communication and quantum information processing .",
    "this prompts the question for efficient sources of correlated photons .",
    "a standard method for generating entangled photons is the parametric down - conversion processes @xcite .",

    "non - classical photon pairs for scalable quantum communication with atomic ensembles and ultraviolet entangled photons in a semiconductor were generated in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "an atomic memory for correlated photon states was demonstrated in @xcite , and a heralded entanglement source was realized in  @xcite . however , despite the large variety of sources , in many cases applications are restricted by a limited production rate for correlated photons , and by the lack of sources with tunable correlations .",

    "we then investigate second - order correlation functions of light scattered into the various spectral lines .",
    "the disordered ensemble is modelled by calculating the emitted light for a fixed orientation between the atoms , followed by a suitable configuration averaging . for this",
    ", we compare three different averaging procedures .",
    "we find that the second - order correlation functions typically exhibit strong correlations if detected close to the forward scattering direction , whereas the corresponding first - order correlation functions are isotropic .",
    "in particular , bunching together with super- or sub - poissonian photon statistics can be achieved for different combinations of spectral lines , and in some cases the statistics is tunable by the choice of the detector positions .",
    "we additionally demonstrate that light emitted from certain spectral bands violates a cauchy - schwarz inequality . since the unnormalized second - order correlation functions of the emitted light scales with the number of particle in the ensemble squared , intense beams of correlated photons can be generated .",
    "we proceed by investigating an atomic sample of arbitrary shape and of characteristic size @xmath10 , consisting of distinguishable non - overlapping two - level particles .",
    "we assume conditions such that multiple scattering effects can be neglected , i.e. , we consider the single scattering regime in which the photon mean free path length is of the order of the sample size or larger .",

    "as a first result , we note from eqs .",
    "( [ cors ] ) that the second order correlation function can exceed unity in several cases together with bunching , which means that there is an enhanced probability to generate photons in pairs .",

    "it can be seen that even after the averaging , the correlation function exhibits a sharp peak around direction of the the incident laser wave - vector @xmath0 , indicating super - bunching .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the case with a single two - photon detector ( @xmath114 ) for different emission directions @xmath8 .",

    "the curves are as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . ]",
    "we further define the cauchy - schwarz parameter @xmath120^{2 } } = \\frac{g^{(2)}_{ll}(0)\\ : g^{(2)}_{rr}(0)}{\\left [ g^{(2)}_{rl}(0)\\right]^{2}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which relates the correlation between photons emitted into individual modes to the cross - correlation between photons emitted into two different modes @xcite . if @xmath121 the cauchy - schwarz inequality is violated .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows violation of the cauchy - schwarz inequality for photons scattered into the side - bands .",
    "an interpretation of the results obtained in the previous section can be found in the semiclassical dressed - state picture .",
    "suppose one laser photon is absorbed and the atom is in the dressed - state @xmath122 .",
    "then one option will be a spontaneously emitted photon on the @xmath123 transition followed by a further absorption of a laser photon during time - interval @xmath124 and subsequently decay on the same dressed - state transition .",
    "similar effect occurs on the dressed - state transition @xmath125 when initially the emitter is in the @xmath126 dressed - state , and both processes contribute to the central - band scattering where @xmath127 .",
    "another option will be a spontaneously emitted photon on the @xmath128 dressed - state transition followed by an absorption of a laser photon on the @xmath129 transition and further spontaneously decay on the @xmath130 dressed - state transition .",
    "together with the reverse process where a spontaneous emission occurs on the @xmath130 transition ( if initially the particle is in the @xmath126 dressed - state ) followed by a laser absorption on the @xmath123 transition and a subsequently decay on the @xmath128 dressed - state transition , these effects describe photon correlations among the right and left side - bands , or vice versa and , again , @xmath127 , and therefore , we have a directional - dependent photon distribution . in contrast , all other scattering processes , i.e. , two - photon spontaneously emission on the same side - band or cross - correlations involving a side - band photon and a central one do not fulfill the relation @xmath127 , that is @xmath131 , and thus , in these processes the photon distribution will be uniformly in space after a configuration averaging .    comparing the results for the three averaging procedures in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] , it can be seen that the averaging strategy can substantially affect the result quantitatively , even though the qualitative features of the obtained results remain similar .",
    "in particular the averaging over a spherical volume and the numerical sampling in a cubic volume of comparable size agree reasonably well .",
    "a notable difference between the three methods is the sub - poissonian statistics found in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , which is pronounced only in the case of averaging over the spherical shell .",
    "the reason is that the fringe pattern seen when plotting against @xmath8 washes out if the correlation function is averaged over a larger range of distances .    in summary",
    ", we discussed the second order correlation function for light emitted from a strongly and near - resonantly driven dilute cloud of atoms .",
    "because of the strong driving , the fluorescence spectrum separates into distinct peaks , for which the spectral properties can be defined individually .",
    "we have shown that the second - order correlations for various combinations of photons from different spectral lines exhibit bunching together with super- or sub - poissonian photon statistics , tunable by the choice of the detector positions .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated that the cauchy - schwarz inequality is violated for photons emitted from the two spectral side bands .",
    "the emitted light intensity is proportional to the square of the number of particles , and thus can potentially be intense .",
    "interesting applications might arise if the presented method is applied to generate correlated photon pairs in the x - ray domain  @xcite .                                        c. wagenknecht , che - m .",
