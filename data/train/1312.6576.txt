    "driven dissipative systems made of colloidal particles suspended in liquid afford a way to study many - body non - equilibrium dynamics at the single particle level @xcite .",
    "for example , using a 1d crystal of oil droplets driven along a microfluidic channel , non - equilibrium hydrodynamically - induces phonons were recently studied @xcite . surprisingly , the crystal vibrations , in that system , did not decay due to thermal fluctuations , as could be expected at such low reynolds numbers ( re@xmath0 ) , but continued to propagate acoustically at a sound velocity of @xmath1 m/s  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relations of this 1d crystal were different from those of a harmonic crystal , they exhibited symmetry breaking due to flow directionality .",
    "here we study the collective excitations of a different driven dissipative system . in our system particles",
    "are driven along a ring - like optical trap , which means that they are confined to a quasi one dimensional track , but interact hydrodynamically in 3d rather than in 2d as in the previously studied system @xcite .",
    "moreover , particles in our system tend to pair due to a hydrodynamically induced pseudo - attraction @xcite .",
    "we show here , that this pairing interaction greatly affects the particles collective excitations .",

    "we use holographic optical tweezers ( hots ) @xcite to confine suspended colloidal particles and drive them along a 1d circular optical trap .",
    "thus particles never leave the field of view , and can be followed for long periods of time ( i.e. an hour ) .",
    "one type of such a circular trap is created with hots by projecting a helical beam of light ( optical vortex ) , carrying angular momentum @xcite , into the sample plain ( fig [ fig : system ] ) .",
    "when particles are trapped in an optical vortex beam , this angular momentum is transfered to them , causing them to rotate around the ring - shaped optical trap @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the trapped colloidal particles constitute a driven dissipative system in which the particles are driven at constant angular velocity and are coupled to a thermal bath ( the suspending media ) . many properties of this model system have bean calculated @xcite and measured @xcite in the past two decades . on a broader context , a single particle driven along a ring trap constitutes a model for the motion of cilia @xcite , and has been used to study synchronization among cilia hairs in arrays of ring traps ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the same mechanism that is responsible for particle pairing of two particles rotating in a single ring @xcite , causes synchronization between single particles rotating in two adjacent rings @xcite . in both cases",
    "the effect depends on the ratio between tangential driving and radial confinement along the ring .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath2 suspended colloidal particles subjected each to a force , @xmath3 , and interacting hydrodynamically , are given by @xcite : * v*_i=_j=1^n*h*_ij*f*_j .",
    "[ eq : vel ] where @xmath4 is the velocity of particle @xmath5 .",
    "it is common practice to assume pairwise additivity of the hydrodynamic interactions @xcite in the stokeslet approximation to derive @xmath6 ; * h*_ij_ij+ ( * i*+*r*_ij*r*_ij ) ( 1-_ij ) [ eq : stokes ] where @xmath7 is the stokes drag on the sphere , and @xmath8 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid . in an optical vortex the optical forces acting on a typical particle are a constant tangential driving force @xmath9 , and a radial confining force @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the trap stiffness , @xmath12 is the radial position of particle @xmath5 , and @xmath13 is the radius of the optical vortex .",
    "these equations of motion were linearized , at zero temperature , around a configuration of equidistant arrays of trapped particles in @xcite .",
    "the angular velocity of the particles , @xmath14 , was separated into a constant value , @xmath15 and a time varying component , @xmath16 . assuming the radial confinement to be infinitely strong , @xmath15 and @xmath17 are given by : & = & ( 1+_ij ) + & = & - _ ij_j [ eq : motion ] where @xmath18 , @xmath8 the fluid viscosity , and @xmath19 the radius of the colloidal particles .",
    "the solution of these equations reveals several oscillatory modes of motion which the system can adopt @xcite . in experiments , trapped",
    "colloidal particles seem to alternate between the different modes @xcite .",
    "note that these modes are inherently different from the hydrodynamic modes that exist in equilibrated arrays of trapped colloids @xcite as they have real eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that when only two particles are trapped in an optical vortex , they pair .",
    "this pairing attraction is a result of symmetry breaking induced by the curved path the particles are forced to take .",
    "consequently , the average angular velocity of particles in an @xmath2 particle vortex can be predicted from the zero mode motion of the aforementioned equations of motion @xcite , by treating each particle pair as an effective particle with an effective mobility @xcite .",
    "one important aspect of the pairing interaction is that it is a pure non - equilibrium effect , it arises only through driving .",
    "this means that the effects of driving are observable even in the co - rotating frame , i.e. the formation of particle pairs .",
    "particle pairing can be overcome in two ways : by increasing temperature , or by increasing the ratio between the radial confinement force and the tangential driving force , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the collective excitations of particles trapped in an optical vortex as a function of the pairing interaction strength .",
    "we start by demonstrating , for the first time , that @xmath21 can be controlled by tuning laser powers .",
    "we then correlated between the trapping laser power and @xmath21 , in a one - particle vortex , and find a range in which @xmath21 changes linearly with laser power .",
    "we proceed to verify the assumption that @xmath21 controls pairing by measuring the average angular separation between two particles trapped in an optical vortex as a function of @xmath21 measured from single particle experiments .",
    "finally , we turn our attention to the collective vibrational modes of many particles trapped in an optical vortex .",
    "we start by calculating theoretically and numerically the dispersion relations of particles in a vortex as a function of the driving force and particle number .",
    "we then compare our calculations to the experimentally measured dispersion relations and show that they are non - decaying , similar to what was found for a 1d crystal of oil droplets @xcite , but are better described as fluctuations of particle pairs rather than as fluctuations of single , separated , beads .",
    "* experiments*- colloidal suspensions of polystyrene beads , 1.1 @xmath22 in diameter ( invitrogen lots # 742530 ) , were place in between a glass slide and a cover - slip to form an approximately 40  @xmath22 thick sample . during experiments the suspended colloidal particles",
    "were subjected to an optical vortex trap generated by holographic optical tweezers @xcite . in our setup a gaussian laser beam ( coherent , verdi @xmath23  nm ) is transformed into a helical beam carrying a topological charge of @xmath24 using a spatial light modulator ( hamamtsu , x10468 - 04 ) .",
    "the beam is then inserted into an inverted microscope ( olympus , ix71 ) and focused through the microscope objective ( 100x oil immersion na=1.4 ) forming a ring - like optical trap with a diameter of @xmath25  @xmath22 and diffraction limited thickness .",
    "we performed three sets of experiments trapping either 1,2 or 21 particles , driving them at laser powers of 0.5 - 4 w ( at the output of the laser ) , and imaging them at either 10 fps ( hamamtsu , orca flash 4 ) , or at 70.4 fps ( gazzele , point gray ) .",

    "the roughness of the optical potential is characterized indirectly , by studying the tangential diffusion of a single particle ( fig .",

    "there are two possible effects that can explain the discrepancy between experiment and simulation : the weaker hydrodynamic interaction in experiments due to the presence of a nearby glass wall , and the experimental rugged optical landscape over which the particles are driven .    in order to obtain more intuitive understanding of the collective excitations in our system , we calculate theoretically the dispersion relation of particles in an optical vortex .",

    "assuming that particle pairs are point objects with double the force acting on them we can use the same equation ( eq .  ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) ) to model their dispersion relations provided we multiple @xmath52 by 2 and divide the number of particles by 2 .",
    "clearly , neither configuration describes our experiments well , as our particles ( and particle pairs ) are not point objects , radial confinement is not infinitely strong , and particles positions fluctuate significantly ( see fig .",

    "the theoretical calculations are normalized by the calculated average angular velocity of particles in the vortex .",
    "we observe , from eq .",

    ", we find that particle pairing affects the collective excitations of the beads .",
    "the fact that the normalized experimental curves do not collapse to a single curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion_compare]a ) reflects the change in pairing strength with @xmath21 , as was observed in the two - particle vortex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dtheta ] ) .",
    "the sound velocity @xmath78 approaches that of an equally distributed array of single particles at low pairing strength , and that of an equally distributed array of particle pairs at high pairing strength .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sound velocity of the particle waves ( @xmath74m / s@xmath79 m/s ) is higher than the average velocity of the particles ( @xmath80m / s@xmath81 m/s ) .",
    "the shape of the experimental curve changes gradually with pairing strength approaching the single particle curve at weak pairing .",
    "for all cases , at low frequencies , or at large distances the dispersion relations are closer to those calculated for single particles , but at high frequencies , or short distances coupling prevails .",
    "increases and pairing decreases the experimental curves depart from the simulated curve and approach the theoretical curve for single particles .",
    "b ) comparison of experiment , theory and simulation . while the shape of the dispersion relation on the simulated system is identical to that obtained from experimental data , the amplitude is 2.7 times higher in experiment ( with @xmath69 ) than in simulation . ]    comparing our results with a driven 1d crystal oil droplet suspension studied recently @xcite , we find many similarities . both systems exhibit symmetry breaking in the dispersion relations due to the directionality of driving . in both systems",
    "hydrodynamic interactions maintain vibrational modes in spite of the overdamped conditions , and the sound velocity of the collective vibrational modes is of the order of several hundreds of micrometers per second .",
    "unlike the oil droplet crystal , instabilities in the optical vortex are subdued due to the strong radial confinement . however , when the 1d volume fraction of particles , approaches @xmath82 trapping becomes unstable . in such cases particles",
    "are continuously kicked out of the ring trap and are later on absorbed back in @xcite .",
    "another unique trait of our system , is that hydrodynamic interactions are responsible both for creating the underlying configuration of equidistant particle pairs and for maintaining its vibrational excitations .",
    "this is different from the microfluidic 1d suspension whose crystalline structure stems from initial conditions of formation . even in room temperature , where particle pairing is relatively weak ( see fig . [ fig : particles]a ) , we find that the pairing effect is dominant in the collective vibrations of the driven particles .",
    "the dynamics of the driven particles and their collective excitations are reproduced reasonably well by numerical simulation , as discussed above .",
    "however , the effect of thermal fluctuations on the dynamics should be examined in the future . while in simulation we expect thermal fluctuation to be decoupled from the periodic motion of the particles and hence result in a trivial cloaking of the motion , in experiments this need not be the case .",
    "the issue of whether thermal fluctuations or the vortex inhomogeneities are the dominant source of noise remains unclear and requires a more detailed study .",
    "the beating of large assemblies of cilia hairs can be random , synchronized ( with identical phase ) , or metachronal ( traveling wave ) @xcite .",
    "arrays of particles , each rotating around a ring , were used to model these collective modes both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . since particle pairing in a single vortex",
    "is related to the synchronized motion of two cilia hairs , it seems that the collective excitations observed in our system should correspond to collective beating of assemblies of cilia hairs . in this paper ,",
    "the collective excitation found for many particles in a single ring is of the traveling wave mode , full synchronization would correspond to all particles moving in union in a single group .",
    "it would be interesting , to find the transition between the modes of motion in the optical vortex system and compare their onset to beating cilia , especially due to the larger number of particles accessible experimentally compared to multiple ring systems .",
