    "in 1979 , fritz john published his pioneering work @xcite , which was the first one that discovered the critical power of the blow - up phenomenon for wave equations .",
    "after this article , many people worked on this kind of blow - up problem . for details and many other related references ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "these work generalize the critical power to other dimensions , some of them also provide simpler proof by imposing additional assumptions or by applying different methods .    the paper @xcite claims the following well - known theorem .    [ mainthm ]",
    "let @xmath3 be a continuous function which satisfies @xmath4 moreover , suppose there exists @xmath5 and @xmath1 such that for all @xmath6 . then for any function @xmath7 that solves @xmath8 where @xmath9 and both of them have compact support , we have @xmath10 in @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath2 denotes the dalembertian operator : @xmath12 .",
    "the key step to prove this theorem is the statement as following .",
    "[ keythm ] let @xmath5 , @xmath1 , let @xmath13 be a @xmath14 solution of @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , suppose there exists a point @xmath16 such that @xmath17 for @xmath18 , then @xmath13 has compact support and @xmath19    [ decomp . of u ]",
    "if @xmath13 satisfies @xmath20 with initial data @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then one decomposes @xmath13 by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 solves @xmath25 and @xmath26 suffices @xmath27    for any @xmath16 , the forward cone @xmath28 and the backward cone @xmath29 are defined as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in the proof of theorem [ keythm ]",
    ", @xcite employs a technical induction which requires complicated calculations . by introducing a suitable nonlinear functional",
    ", this paper gives a much more succinct proof which follows a gronwall s type inequality .",
    "the organization of this paper is as following : in section [ preliminaries ] , it is shown how theorem [ keythm ] implies theorem [ mainthm ] , the argument is from @xcite .",
    "in addition , some notations and a basic lemma are introduced , where the lemma is the key technique used in section [ using g s type ineq . ] . in section [ proof of keythm ] , we prove theorem [ keythm ] .",
    "more precisely , section [ set - up steps ] , the first part of the proof , follows from @xcite with modifications while section [ using g s type ineq . ] , the rest part of the proof , comes from our own observation .",
    "firstly , one can assume that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 have support in @xmath32 , then by huygens principle , @xmath33 in @xmath34 .",
    "it follows from theorem [ keythm ] that @xmath35 .",
    "secondly , one considers the function @xmath36 for @xmath37 . using the assumptions on @xmath38 in theorem [ mainthm ]",
    ", one can see @xmath39 for some fixed @xmath40 depending on @xmath13 and @xmath38 . then by energy estimate , @xmath41 in @xmath42 . thus theorem [ mainthm ]",
    "is verified .      for any function @xmath43 , its radial average function ( with respect to spatial variable ) @xmath44",
    "is defined by @xmath45    now let s calculate the radial average of the solution @xmath13 to the wave equation @xmath20 with zero initial data . to do so , one defines @xmath46 by @xmath47 , then we will have @xmath48 hence @xmath49 which implies @xmath50    for convenience , one defines the operator @xmath51 acting on @xmath52 with domain @xmath53 by @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( see figure [ fig first ] ) .    ]",
    "it is clear that @xmath51 is a positive operator and now we can rewrite ( [ radial ave . of inhomo .",
    "soln ] ) as @xmath56 whenever @xmath13 solves @xmath20 with initial data .",
    "next , we introduce a lemma which is a generalized gronwall s type inequality with weight .",
    "[ intineqlemma ] let @xmath57 with @xmath58 , suppose @xmath59 to be continuous and @xmath60 for any @xmath61 .",
    "then there does not exist constants @xmath62 such that @xmath63    suppose there exist @xmath62 such that ( [ intineq ] ) holds , then one defines @xmath64 by @xmath65 now for any @xmath66 , it follows from ( [ intineq ] ) that @xmath67 and therefore @xmath68 as a result , for any @xmath69 , @xmath70 now the left hand side is bounded by @xmath71 which is a fixed number . however , the right hand side @xmath72 when @xmath73 , since @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the lemma follows .    later in section [ using g s type ineq .",
    "] , in order to prove the finite time blow - up , the goal is to construct a function @xmath75 , associated with the solution of ( [ prob ] ) , which satisfies ( [ intineq ] ) with @xmath76 related to the exponent @xmath77 .",
    "to verify theorem [ keythm ] , first of all , without loss of generality , one can assume @xmath78 to be the origin in @xmath79 , otherwise just doing a translation .",
    "in addition , we can suppose @xmath80 , otherwise just doing a dilation .    now using proof by contradiction",
    ", one assumes @xmath81 is not in @xmath82 , then there exists @xmath83 but @xmath84 . set @xmath85 , then @xmath86 and therefore @xmath87 .    since @xmath88 in @xmath89 and @xmath87 , then @xmath88 in @xmath90 . as a consequence , for any @xmath91",
    ", @xmath92 noticing the fact that @xmath51 is positive and the assumption @xmath93 in theorem [ keythm ] , it follows from ( [ inhomo .",
    "soln . rep . by p",
    "] ) that @xmath94 because of the simple fact @xmath95 , one has that    @xmath96    from ( [ rad .",
    "point est . 1 ] ) , we have @xmath97 since the point @xmath98 lies in @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "now one fixes @xmath101 and a positive number @xmath102 , then considers the regions ( see figure [ fig second ] )     and @xmath103    @xmath104 @xmath105    it is easy to check that the fixed region @xmath106 for any @xmath107 .",
    "then it follows from ( [ rad .",
    "ave . point est .",
    "2 ] ) that for any @xmath107 , @xmath108 where @xmath40 is a positive constant due to ( [ positive on s = t_2+lambda ] ) .    let @xmath109 , where @xmath110 .",
    "for any @xmath111 , one defines the sets ( see figure [ fig third ] )     and @xmath112    @xmath113 @xmath114    then for any @xmath111 , we get @xmath115 thus from ( [ rad .",
    "point est . 2 ] ) , ( [ averpointest ] ) , ( [ graphinfo3 ] ) , one obtains @xmath116 the area of @xmath117 is @xmath118 and for any point @xmath119 in it , @xmath120 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath121 where @xmath122 is a positive constant .      until now",
    ", the ideas are natural and all the estimates are not difficult to get . but after this step , @xcite claims an induction : @xmath123 where @xmath124 satisfy complex recurrence formulas . by tedious computations , one finds that @xmath125 is the dominant term and @xmath126 , then the blow - up follows when taking @xmath127 to be a fixed large number and @xmath128 .    in the following , we will carry out a much more concise argument by introducing a suitable nonlinear functional and making use of lemma [ intineqlemma ] .",
    "firstly , we observe from ( [ rad .",
    "ave . point est . 2 ] ) and ( [ graphinfo3 ] ) that for any @xmath111 , @xmath129 which implies @xmath130 on @xmath131 and especially by ( [ graphinfo3 ] ) , @xmath130 on @xmath132 .",
    "so we can remove the absolute value sign in the last term of ( [ ineq 1 ] ) to get @xmath133 by change of variable : @xmath134 and @xmath135 , we obtain @xmath136    here comes an important observation by considering @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 corresponding to the definition of @xmath131 . now ( [ betteraverpointest ] ) becomes @xmath140 moreover , ( [ posaverineqcov ] ) becomes @xmath141    from here , it attempts to employ the gronwall s inequality technique , which reduces the blow - up problem to a pure analysis technique .",
    "this is our motivation .",
    "however we can not apply it directly since gronwall s inequality only deals with single variable and the right hand side being a double integral .",
    "in addition , ( [ pointestintcov ] ) involves some weight functions . to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we introduce some new functions and make use of lemma [ intineqlemma ] together with ( [ pointestcov ] ) .    for @xmath142 to be determined later",
    ", we define @xmath143 by @xmath144 from ( [ pointestintcov ] ) , @xmath145 we define @xmath146 by @xmath147 and integrate ( [ g1ineq ] ) for @xmath148 from @xmath149 to @xmath150",
    ". then the left hand side of ( [ g1ineq ] ) becomes @xmath151 . in order to exploit lemma [ intineqlemma ] , the right hand side ,",
    "hopefully after changing the order of integration , can become a single integral of @xmath151 .",
    "we calculate as follows , @xmath152 \\,d\\b\\,d\\a.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath142 , then @xmath153 . as a result , @xmath154 we choose @xmath155 and denote @xmath156 to be a constant which is independent of the variable @xmath150 but may be different from line to line , then @xmath157 using holder s inequality , @xmath158 so @xmath159 plugging in ( [ h1ineq ] ) gives @xmath160    now it is almost done !",
    "only trouble for applying lemma [ intineqlemma ] is that @xmath161 may be less than @xmath162 . in order to raise the power of @xmath163",
    ", we borrow the idea from @xcite .",
    "namely , we write @xmath164 and hope to find @xmath165 for some @xmath166 , which can increase the power of @xmath167 by @xmath168 .    from ( [ pointestcov ] ) and the definition of @xmath169 and @xmath75 , we have for any @xmath170 , @xmath171 getting back to ( [ hineqsingle ] ) , for any @xmath172 , one gets @xmath173 where @xmath174    since @xmath1 , then @xmath175 and therefore it is possible to choose small @xmath176 in @xmath177 such that @xmath178 .    now applying lemma [ intineqlemma ] with @xmath179",
    ", we get contradiction .",
    "thus we reject the assumption @xmath180 , hence theorem [ keythm ] follows .",
