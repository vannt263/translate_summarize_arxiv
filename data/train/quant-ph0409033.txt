    "the latest prognoses forecast a transistor size shrinkage to its 1 nm limit up to the year 2010 , where the impacts of the quantum effects rise remarkably@xcite",
    ". several new methods were published to replace the silicon based technology , one of them exploits the power of quantum computation .",
    "unfortunately , it does not exists quantum computer solution with proper size , so far .",
    "in addition several research papers showed the constraints of the application range of quantum computers , that would not relegate classical computation which shows the demand on quantum assisted computation , which could amplify computational power enormously in the next future .",
    "this research work focuses on the exploitation of the strengths of quantum computation in classically difficult problems .    in every communication chain",
    "a decision has to be made at least in the receiver side , often without any _ a - priori _ known information , e.g. _ a - posteriori _ probability or the probability density function ( pdf ) of the source .",
    "the estimation of the probability density function of observed signals shows a significant interest in many signal processing methods , such as pattern recognition , independent component analysis or detection .",
    "it exists a lot of well defined estimation techniques based on histogram or kernel method@xcite , which requires a large number of samples @xmath0 to estimate the pdf almost sure as described for the @xmath1 case by @xmath2 a more tight lower bound for kernel estimator can be found , e.g. in@xcite . in case of decision problems , however , the knowledge of the whole pdf is often not needed , rather the pdf at a single point is of interest .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the overall system model is introduced in section  [ sec : system ] . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] the probability density function estimation is showed , and section  [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "by help of _ a - priori _ knowledge of the observed system , a quantum register @xmath3 as a database is used to store all the raw quantized parameters , e.g. delay , heat , velocity , etc . values@xcite .",
    "the database ( [ eq:2 ] ) have to be set up in the hardware only once for the whole estimation process . to handle the large amount of data a virtual database @xmath4 ,",
    "should be introduced@xcite , where @xmath5 describes the behavior of the system and @xmath6 denotes the index of the qregister @xmath7 , respectively . the function",
    "@xmath8 points to an record in the virtual database@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath9 is not obligingly mutual unambiguous consequently , i.e. it is not reversible , except for several special cases , when the virtual database contains @xmath10 only once . in this case",
    "the parameter settings of the system are easy to determine .",
    "henceforth the fact should be kept in mind that @xmath9 is in almost every case a so called one way function which is easy to evaluate in one direction , but to estimate the inverse is rather hard .",
    "the function @xmath11 generates all the possible disturbances additional to the considered input value .",
    "this is of course a large amount of information , @xmath12 , where @xmath0 is the length of the qregister @xmath7 . for an example",
    "let us assume a 15-qbit qregister .",
    "the function @xmath13 in ( [ eq:2 ] ) generates @xmath14 output values . taking into account the large number of possible points in the set surface",
    "the optimal classification in a classical way becomes difficult . at the first glace this problem looks more difficult to solve , however , using the deutsch - jozsa@xcite quantum parallelization algorithm ,",
    "an arbitrary unitary operation can be executed on all the prepared states contemporaneously .      roughly speaking the task",
    "is to find the entry ( entries ) in the virtual databases which is ( are ) equal to the observed data @xmath15 . to accomplish the database search",
    "the grover database search algorithm should be invoked@xcite , where we feed the received signal @xmath16 and @xmath9 to the oracle @xmath17 .",
    "because of the fact of tight bound , in real application less iterations would be also appropriate@xcite . employing the grover database search algorithm we are able to find the entries in the virtual databases , however , it is not needed to perform a complete search because the search result the exact index ( indices ) of the searched item(s) is ( are ) not interesting but the number how often a given configuration is involved in @xmath9 or not . for that purpose a new function @xmath18 is defined@xcite , which counts the number of similar entries in the virtual database , which corresponds to the conditional probability density function @xmath15 to be in the set @xmath5 .",
    "for that reason it is worth stepping forward to quantum counting@xcite based on grover iteration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ijqi1 ] ) .",
    "in this section we deal with the estimation of the probability density function at a single input point and with the estimation of the whole pdf by quantum assisted way .      based on the proposed",
    "pdf estimation method a decision is possible at a single input point .",
    "as an example a decision has to be made in a telecommunication receiver . a received signal @xmath15",
    "is given , which is the bernoulli - distributed source signal @xmath19}$ ] disturbed by the communication channel .",
    "for the sake of simplicity only an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel is assumed , @xmath20 , where @xmath0 is the gaussian distributed noise sample . in case of no known _ a - priori _ probability a decision in maximum likelihood ( ml ) sense seems to be appropriate , which maximize the likelihood function based on the ( estimated ) pdf .",
    "the value @xmath21 was received in the detector , the task is to decide whether @xmath22 with noise vector @xmath23 or @xmath24 with @xmath25 was detected as shown in fig  [ fig : pdf2 ] . employing the pdf estimator and the decision device ( a simple comparator ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ijqi2 ] the number of the overall accuracies of the given @xmath15 in the system is calculated , which is slightly more than 1400 for the @xmath22 belonging to the solid lined pdf , and less than 200 for the other one . in this way the likelihood functions are well calculated and a fast decision is possible .",
    "you may find another example in@xcite .              in many cases , however , the knowledge of the whole pdf is required , e.g. for independence testing of input sequences by kl divergence @xmath26 where @xmath27 have to be fulfilled for the independence . to get know the pdf in quantum assisted way a estimation method introduced in ( [ ssec:3.1 ] )",
    "should be invoked for a large number of input values ( @xmath15 ) to get a good approximation @xmath28 in @xmath1 sense .",
    "should be @xmath29 chosen to @xmath30 the method may converge to continuous pdf estimation , which is impossible because of time consumption and quantized behavior of the element in the database ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the problem is quite similar to the problem of the number of bins in classical histogram method@xcite .",
    "this paper provides a brief introduction to quantum assisted probability density function estimation .",
    "the inaccuracy of the pdf estimation may result in wrong detection , however , the quantum assisted estimator is able to achieve the exact value of the pdf at a single point ( received signal ) that could make a decision more accurate .",
    "the proposed qregister @xmath7 have to be set up only once before the estimation .",
    "the virtual databases are generated once and directly leaded to the grover block in the quantum counting circuit , which reduce the computational complexity , substantially .",
    "the paper should be regarded as a starting point to further analyze the properties of the quantum assisted pdf estimator .",
