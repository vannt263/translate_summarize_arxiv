    "forbidden atomic fine structure transitions are important cooling lines of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "they provide effective cooling in cold regions where allowed atomic transitions can not be excited , thus providing critical diagnostic tools to study the star  forming ism . perhaps the most important cooling line is the forbidden @xmath10p@xmath11p@xmath12 fine - structure line of ionized carbon ( [ cii ] ) at 158 microns .",
    "other main cooling lines are the oxygen [ oi ] ( 63 microns ) and [ oiii ] ( at 52 and 88 microns ) lines , as well as the nitrogen [ nii ] lines at 122 and 205 microns ( hereafter ) . observations of a combination of these lines have proven to provide key diagnostics regarding the physical properties of the atomic interstellar medium in galaxies ( e.g. , probes for interstellar uv radiation field , photon dominated regions [ pdrs ] , temperature , gas density and mass , e.g. , petuschowski & bennett 1993 , van der werf 1999 ) . as the ionization potential of carbon is 11.3ev ( hydrogen :",
    "13.6ev ) , [ cii ] is a tracer for both the neutral atomic and ionized medium , predominantly of pdrs .",
    "the ionization potentials for oxygen and nitrogen , on the other hand , are 13.6ev and 14.53ev , respectively , implying that their forbidden ionized fine structure lines trace the ionized medium only .",
    "the  line , which is the focus of this study , is of particular interest as it has a critical density that is very close to that of [ cii ] , thus potentially providing complementary information on the origin of the [ cii ] emission ( e.g. oberst et al .",
    "2006 ) .    given the poor atmospheric transmission at mid/far  infrared wavelengths most of of these lines in the local universe can only be studied using airborne or space  based observatories . at sufficiently high redshift ,",
    "however , some of the lines are shifted to the ( sub)millimeter bands that can be observed from the ground . especially at redshifts approaching the epoch of reionization ( z@xmath97 )",
    "these lines provide the only tools by which to study the properties of the star  forming ism using ( sub)millimeter facilities , as the excited rotational lines of the standard tracer , co , will be shifted outside the observable ( sub)millimeter bands ( walter & carilli 2008 ) .    whereas the [ cii ] line has now been abundantly detected in the local universe ( e.g. , stacey et al .",

    ". given the potential importance of the  line in studies of the ism in the very early universe , multiple attempts were performed to detect this line at high redshift ( 4c41.17 and pc2047 + 0123 : ivison & harris 1996 , the cloverleaf : benford 1999 , apm08279 : krips et al .",

    "this is due to the fact that only very high rotational transitions of co can be observed at these redshifts using ( sub)millimeter facilities .",
    "however , strong emission from the highest ( j@xmath45 ) co levels requires very highly excited gas ( either due to high kinetic temperatures , high densities , or both ) that is typically not present in large quantities in normal starforming environments ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "therefore high  j co lines are faint and difficult to detect in such systems .",

    "it is obvious from this figure that at z@xmath97 , the atomic fine structure lines will be critical probes to constrain the properties of the interstellar medium using ( sub)millimeter instruments .",
    "redshifted mm  wavelength molecular line observations have so far only probed the molecular medium of the target sources .",
    "fine structure lines of various species , and in particular their luminosity ratios , will also yield information on the neutral and ionized gas that is more dilute .",
    "even though we have not detected the  line in our observations , we have reached a limit that is consistent with what is found in our galaxy and in the starburst galaxy m82 .",
