    "the importance of film growth in the field of high temperature htsc superconductors has lead to a search for new substrates with properties optimized for various applications .",
    "the substrates have to be compatible with the film both in physical properties such as lattice parameter , thermal expansion coefficient as well as chemical properties , for example the avoidance of certain elements such as silicon which can diffuse from the substrate to the film .",
    "the use of the film in passive microwave devices , or to fabricate josephson junctions further restrict the choice of substrate materials .",
    "popular substrate materials for htsc films include laalo@xmath3 , srtio@xmath3 , ndgao@xmath3 , mgo , with the majority of the work being done on yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5 .",
    "recently several groups have begun using the crystal substrate , lasrgao@xmath0 , which has some promising properties for the production of microwave devices and josephson junctions .",
    "lasrgao@xmath0   has a tetragonal k@xmath4nif@xmath0 structure with the la and sr distributed statistically on the k sites.@xcite the space group of this structure is i4/_mmm _ ( d@xmath6 ) .",
    "seven infrared active modes are predicted by group theory@xcite ; four e@xmath7 modes perpendicular to the _ c _ axis and three a@xmath8 modes parallel to the _ c _ axis.@xcite the lattice parameters of lasrgao@xmath0  are _ a_= 3.84    and _ c_=12.86    at room temperature with the _ a _ axis being a close match to the _ a _ and _ b_-axes of yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5 .",
    "the room temperature dielectric constant at 10  ghz is @xmath9 which compares favorably with that of laalo@xmath3 . the thermal expansion coefficient along the _ a _ axis is 10 ppm/@xmath10c providing a reasonable match to that of yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5  ( 12.6 ppm/@xmath10c ) .    hontsu _ et al . _ and others have shown that lasrgao@xmath0  can be used to grow good quality yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5  thin films.@xcite a recent comparison study indicates that the yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5  films grown on lasrgao@xmath0  were of comparable quality in transition temperature , critical current , and surface morphology , to the films grown on laalo@xmath3.@xcite most importantly for microwave applications , lasrgao@xmath0does not suffer from any phase transition which can lead to twinning as does laalo@xmath3 .",
    "it has been reported that lasrgao@xmath0  has been used to produce yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5  _ a _ axis films which display a high degree of in - plane alignment of the _ c _ axis.@xcite this is of interest because good quality _ a _ axis films may be used in the manufacture of josephson junctions ; they are also convenient for studies of the properties of yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5  thin films .",
    "lasrgao@xmath0  has also been used for the growth of _ a _ axis aligned bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cuo@xmath11 films.@xcite a number of studies of junctions utilizing lasrgao@xmath0  as a substrate or as a barrier layer have been published , pointing to its potential in device manufacturing.@xcite one study of a variety of substrates suggests that lasrgao@xmath0  may allow the manufacture of a microwave resonator and filter with a temperature independent center frequency.@xcite    a study of the infrared properties of the substrate material serves several goals .",
    "one can form an estimate of the fundamental microwave properties of a dielectric material from an extrapolation of the low frequency portion of its infrared spectrum.@xcite also , for fundamental studies of the properties of thin films it is often found that if the films are thinner than the microwave penetration depth the fields penetrate into the substrate and the measurements have to be corrected for substrate effects by including corrections that assume a knowledge of the optical constants of the substrate .",
    "reflectance measurements polarized along the axes of thin films are of use in comparing the results with those of single crystals and offer a ready technique for characterization when single crystals of sufficient size are difficult to produce .",
    "however , a knowledge of the optical properties of the underlying substrate is critical to the interpretation of the spectrum since it is a convolution of the optical properties of both the film and the substrate . with this as a motivation , the optical properties of lasrgao@xmath0  were measured along both _ a _ and _ c _ polarizations from 50  @xmath2  to 40000  @xmath2 .",
    "the lasrgao@xmath0  crystals used were grown at the brockhouse institute of materials reserach at mcmaster university using a czochralski growth technique described elsewhere.@xcite the samples used for optical measurements were cut in two orientations , ( 001 ) for _ a _ axis measurements and ( 010 ) for _ c _ axis .",
    "the samples were polished to an optically smooth finish and mounted on flat holders .",
    "the far infrared ( fir ) measurements were made on a michelson interferometer using an _ in situ _ gold coating technique to determine the absolute reflectance.@xcite we estimate the uncertainty of @xmath121% in the overall reflectance level .",
    "bolometer detectors at 1.4k and a 4.2k were used in the 50  @xmath2  to 800  @xmath2 frequency range , and an mct detector was used from 700  @xmath2  to 7000  @xmath2 .",
    "the resolution was 4  @xmath2  up to 800  @xmath2   and 10  @xmath2  between 1000  @xmath2   to 7000  @xmath2 .",
    "the samples were cooled by a controlled liquid helium flow through a cold finger .",
    "the remaining frequencies from 7000  @xmath2  to 40000  @xmath2  were measured using a diffraction grating spectrometer using _ in situ _ deposition of gold or aluminum .",
    "the resolution for this region was 200  @xmath2 .",
    "the measurements above 800  @xmath2  were made at room temperature , since the samples displayed no significant temperature dependence in the reflectance above this frequency .",
    "figure  [ a - refl ] shows the reflectance polarized along the _ a _ axis from 50 to 1500  @xmath2  at 300  k , 150  k , and 10  k. the inset shows the 300  k _ a _ axis reflectance for the full range measured , 50 to 40000  @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ c - refl ] shows the reflectance polarized along the _ c _ axis from 50 to 1500  @xmath2  for temperatures 300  k , 200  k , 100  k and 10  k. the inset shows the 300  k _ c _ axis reflectance from 50 to 40000  @xmath2 .",
    "the heights of the reflectance peaks can be seen to be increasing with decreasing temperature in a monotonic fashion .",
    "the optical properties of the sample can be extracted from the spectra using kramers - kronig transformations to calculate the phase , @xmath13 , of the reflectivity , @xmath14 .",
    "the optical constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 are then calculated for each frequency using the following equations : @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ a - epsig ] and figure  [ c - epsig ] show the temperature dependence of the real part of the dielectric function and the conductivity for the _ a _ axis and _ c _ axis polarizations respectively . due to the significant spectral weight at frequencies above 40000  @xmath2 ,",
    "the calculation of these properties is dependent on the choice of high - frequency extrapolation . as a result",
    "the curves have only been presented up to 1000  @xmath2  as below this frequency there was only a weak dependence on the high - frequency extrapolation .",
    "an @xmath22 extrapolation out to @xmath23  @xmath2  followed by an @xmath24 form above this frequency were used to perform the kramers - kronig calculation.@xcite a quadratic extrapolation to @xmath25 as @xmath26 was used for the low frequencies .",
    "looking at figure  [ a - epsig ] ( b ) , the phonon peaks in the conductivity all increase with decreasing temperature with little shift in position , except for the peak at about 675  @xmath2  which can be seen to harden with decreasing temperature .",
    "none of the _ c _ axis phonon peaks in figure  [ c - epsig ] ( b ) shift significantly .",
    "in addition to performing the kramers - kronig calculation , the reflectance data was fitted to a factorized form of the dielectric function @xcite using a non - linear least - squares technique .",
    "the form of the dielectric is as follows :        the results of the fits are summarized in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] for the _ a _ and _ c _ axis data , respectively .",
    "the fitting parameters have been limited by setting @xmath30 , and @xmath31 equal .",
    "the oscillator strength for each mode , @xmath32 can be calculated using@xcite : @xmath33 and the @xmath34 s calculated are listed in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "the number of phonons used to fit the reflectance exceeds the number allowed by group theoretical considerations .",
    "however , the statistical nature of the la and sr placement in the unit cells could result in additional ir - active phonons due to the broken symmetry .",
    "in particular , the lowest phonon peak in the ab plane fitting is only included to account for a small shoulder in the reflectance data at approximately 100 @xmath2 . the remaining 4 phonons result in a good fit to the reflectance spectrum excluding this shoulder .",
    "the _ c _ axis reflectance , due to its asymmetric peaks , requires 5 oscillators to provide a satisfactory fit to the reflectance .",
    "figure  [ rfit ] shows the reflectance for the room temperature data , both _ a _ and _ c _ polarizations , and the fits to the reflectance .",
    "some mode assignments can be tentatively applied to the fitted oscillators by comparison to mode assignments for other isomorphic crystals.@xcite for the _ a _ axis polarization there is one more oscillator than is allowed by group theory .",
    "however @xmath36 is a very weak mode and can be assumed to have been introduced by some symmetry breaking mechanism . of the remaining oscillators ,",
    "@xmath37 can be assigned to a mode where the la / sr atoms move in opposition to the gao@xmath38 octahedra since the larger mass of the la / sr would result in a lower frequency of vibration .",
    "the remaining 3e@xmath7 oscillators are vibrations internal to the gao@xmath38 octahedra.@xcite    the _ c _ axis polarization has two additional modes above what is allowed by group theory .",
    "the @xmath39 mode is very weak and of the remaining four oscillators , it is not obvious which one is not an a@xmath8 mode .",
    "it may be that the normally silent b@xmath8 mode has been activated .",
    "the @xmath36 is likely the mode involving movement of the la / sr atoms with respect to the gao@xmath38 as it has the lowest frequency vibration .",
    "similarly the highest two of the remaining strong modes , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are likely the a@xmath8 modes since they involve vibrations of the light oxygen atoms .",
    "this leaves @xmath37 unassigned .    in conclusion",
    ", we have measured the reflectance of the single crystal , lasrgao@xmath0  , from 50 to 40000  @xmath2  for the _ a _ and _ c _ axes including temperature dependence from 300  k to 10  k. the optical properties are calculated using kramers - kronig transformations on the spectra and the temperature dependence of the real dielectric and conductivity has been presented .",
    "this allows the dependence of the film spectrum on the substrate to be determined .",
    "this is of importance if the _",
    "c _ axis reflectance is to be measured on yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5  thin films or other high-@xmath42  materials grown on this substrate .",
