    "this paper will review experiments testing symmetries of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics by laser trapping and cooling neutral atoms .",
    "the atom traps make possible new experiments to study an old problem , nuclear @xmath0 decay .",
    "the laser cooling and trapping techniques also enable precision atomic measurements , with the possibility of practical experiments with inherently small amounts of radioactive isotopes where symmetry - violating effects are enhanced .",
    "previous reviews of the subject include  @xcite .",
    "it is beyond our scope to cover interesting experiments in weak interactions with ion traps .",
    "ongoing beta - neutrino ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) correlation experiments include measuring the daughter recoil momentum with a penning trap  @xcite , @xmath2-recoil coincidences with a paul trap  @xcite , and other neutrino - induced kinematic shifts in a paul trap  @xcite .",
    "there are several basic features of electroweak unification that trap experiments can test .",
    "the photon has `` heavy light '' boson partners w@xmath3 , w@xmath4 , and z@xmath5 which mediate the weak interaction .",
    "these are all spin-1 `` vector '' bosons , which immediately implies that the lorentz transformation properties of the effective low - energy four - fermion contact operators are vector and axial vector .",
    "measurements using atom traps have constrained other interactions by improved measurements of the historically valuable @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation .    for reasons that are not completely understood , the weak interaction is phenomenologically completely `` chiral '' : it only couples to left - handed neutrinos , and parity is maximally violated .",
    "the first experiments using the @xmath0-decay of laser - cooled polarized atoms have been completed , and there is promise for them to compete with and complement precision measurements of neutron @xmath0 decay .",
    "the neutral weak coupling of the z@xmath5 is predicted from the other couplings . at momentum transfer",
    "much less than the z@xmath5 production , this has been best tested in cesium atomic parity violation using thermal atomic beams  @xcite and in intermediate energy mller scattering at slac  @xcite .",
    "atoms with larger atomic number @xmath6 have larger electron wavefunction overlap with the nucleus , enhancing contact interactions like the weak interaction . for example , atomic parity violation effects , which measure the strength of the neutral weak interaction , scale with @xmath7 , with additional relativistic enhancements of the electron s wavefunction and momentum at the nucleus ( @xmath8 is the number of neutrons ) .",
    "effects in atoms from potential time - reversal violating electric dipole moments are predicted to show similar enhancements , including enhancements from nuclear structure effects like octupole deformation .",
    "many of the most promising enhancements at high @xmath6 are in elements where all isotopes are radioactive , inherently limiting the number of atoms that can be produced .",
    "the traps enable the possibility of tests in such isotopes , utilizing precision techniques developed recently in the atomic physics community .",
    "the weak couplings are also universal in the sense that the quark couplings are given in terms of the lepton couplings .",
    "the weak coupling between nucleons is not fully understood , even phenomenologically  @xcite .",
    "measurement of the nuclear anapole moment in traps could resolve a present discrepancy between the anapole moments of cesium and thallium and low - energy nuclear physics results .",
    "it is useful to first describe the workhorse trap in this field , the magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , sketched in figure  [ fig - mot ] .",
    "a mot can be treated as a damped harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "the damping is provided by laser light from six directions tuned a few linewidths lower than the frequency of an atomic resonance ( `` to the red '' ) .",
    "atoms moving in any direction see light opposing their motion doppler shifted closer to resonance , and preferentially absorb that light and slow down .",
    "this works naturally in three dimensions to cool the atoms .        to have a linear restoring force",
    ", one must evade the `` optical earnshaw theorem '' .",
    "consider poynting s theorem for the divergence of the momentum @xmath9 carried by a plane wave :    @xmath10    this vanishes in a source - free region , when time is averaged over a period of the light wave . when the divergence of the poynting vector is zero , there can not be a three - dimensional trap for point particles from continuous plane waves of light  @xcite ( by analogy with the earnshaw theorem for charged particles in electrostatic fields ) .",
    "the loopholes in this theorem are found directly in the conditions listed : either internal degrees of freedom of the atom are used to make them not pointlike , or time dependence of the light can be harnessed .",
    "ashkin and gordon , the authors of  @xcite , immediately implemented the use of the ` dipole force ' to manipulate the internal degrees of freedom of the non - pointlike atoms  @xcite .",
    "if a laser beam is tuned very far off atomic resonance , almost no photons are absorbed .",
    "instead , the electric field @xmath11 of the laser light polarizes the charge of atoms by the ac stark shift .",
    "the resulting induced electric dipole @xmath12 then couples to @xmath11 , producing a potential energy change of the atom @xmath13 .",
    "one version of this trap is simply a laser beam focused to a diffraction - limited spot , which produces a spatial gradient of @xmath13 in all three dimensions .",
    "this creates a conservative trap without damping , with typical well depths of order @xmath14 kelvin .",
    "such dipole force traps are widely used  @xcite . since they are conservative , they must always be loaded using other dissipative techniques .",
    "there are also time - dependent forces from pulsed lasers that have been shown to provide strong forces by alternately exciting and stimulating photon absorption  @xcite .",
    "similar ` bichromatic ' forces where the time dependence effectively comes from beats between different light frequencies have also been harnessed  @xcite .",
    "dalibard is credited with the most successful idea to manipulate the internal structure of the atoms to preferentially absorb the beam directing atoms to the center , the mot  @xcite , which is shown schematically in figure  [ fig - mot ] .",
    "the linear part of the restoring force is provided by a weak magnetic quadrupole field with gradient @xmath15 10 g / cm produced by anti - helmholtz coils .",
    "this @xmath16 field changes sign at the origin , changing the sign of the zeeman splitting and therefore the probability of absorbing circularly polarized light with opposite handedness in the opposing beams ( see figure  [ fig : mot1d ] ) . coupled with the damping from the red detuning described above",
    ", this makes a dissipative trap that cools and confines atoms",
    ". the depth can be on order one kelvin .",
    "the ability of the mot to cool atoms makes it a typical first trap which then often feeds conservative traps .",
    "the mot s magnetostatic potential is more than an order of magnitude smaller than what is typically used to confine atoms directly in magnetostatic traps  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field of the mot is mainly being used to induce the atoms to absorb one beam or the other .",
    "the result is generally an overdamped harmonic oscillator , with a cloud of atoms @xmath151 mm in diameter collected at the origin . because of the different light polarizations in the six beams",
    ", a normal mot will have atomic and nuclear spin polarization close to zero , though modified geometries have been used to deliberately spin - polarize atoms  @xcite .",
    "because of the near - resonant laser light , mots are inherently highly isotope and isomer selective .",
    "the mean lifetime of atoms in the mot is @xmath15 1 s at a vacuum of @xmath17 torr , limited by the average collision cross - section with background gas , as the momentum transfer in most collisions is more than adequate to eject the trapped atom . a more complete treatment of laser forces on atoms can be found in  @xcite .      from the experimental properties of the mot",
    ", one can immediately see several broad classes of experiments that mots can assist .",
    "the low - energy ( @xmath15 100 ev ) nuclear recoils from @xmath0 decay freely escape the mot they have transmuted to another element so the laser light no longer matters , and the @xmath16 field is very small . using an apparatus similar to figure  [ behrfig1 ] , the recoils can be accelerated in a known electric field to a microchannel plate ( mcp ) .",
    "their time and position of arrival at the mcp , along with their known initial position in the trap cloud ( which has size @xmath15 1 mm ) , allows their momentum to be deduced .",
    "together with measurement of the @xmath0 momentum by more established detection techniques , this allows the reconstruction of the @xmath1 momentum in a much more direct fashion than possible previously .",
    "( measurement of the @xmath0 energy is difficult , but there are kinematic regimes  recoil momenta less than @xmath18 , where q is the maximum @xmath0 kinetic energy for which the neutrino momentum is uniquely defined from the other kinematic observables  @xcite ; see section  [ sec - betanu38mk ] . )",
    "therefore , the angular distribution of @xmath1 s with respect to the @xmath0 direction , the @xmath0-@xmath1 angular correlation , can be measured .",
    "a variety of methods exist to polarize laser - cooled neutral atoms and to accurately measure their polarization , and some will be described in section  [ sec : polarized ] .",
    "knowledge of the polarization of the decaying species is a limiting systematic error in many neutron @xmath0 decay and @xmath19 decay experiments . for most experimental tests of maximal parity violation",
    ", the polarization must be known with error less than 0.1% .",
    "the cold , confined atom cloud also provides a bright source for doppler - free precision spectroscopy of high-@xmath6 radioactive atoms . on the order of 10@xmath20 photons / sec",
    "are emitted into 4@xmath21 for a saturated electric dipole transition .",
    "forbidden transitions that move atoms from one state to another can then be probed efficiently by laser probes exciting allowed transitions .",
    "the atoms can also be interrogated repeatedly by strong laser , microwave , and electric fields in well - controlled environments .",
    "we will see several examples of these powerful techniques below .",
    "tens of thousands of photons must be absorbed to slow atoms from room temperature , so until recently it was assumed that neutral atoms must have reasonably strong cycling transitions to be trapped ( for a cycling or closed transition , spontaneous decay immediately returns the atom back to the state from which it was excited by the laser , leading to continuous re - excitation and strong fluorescence ) .",
    "it is best if the excited state atomic angular momentum @xmath22 , so that all ground state sublevels can be excited by circularly polarized light .",
    "figure  [ behrfig2periodic ] shows elements that have been laser - cooled and/or trapped .",
    "alkali atoms have a single electron outside a closed noble gas core , which makes them ideal cases . typically the @xmath23 transition is used . if the nuclear spin @xmath24 , then hyperfine splitting produces two ground states with total angular momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the transition @xmath26 is then cycling , since decays from @xmath27 to @xmath28 do not proceed by allowed electric dipole transitions .",
    "most of the light is applied just to the red of this ` trapping ' transition .",
    "because of weak off - resonant excitation to @xmath29 excited states , eventually atoms would accumulate in the @xmath28 ground state , so additional , typically much weaker , ` repumping ' light is also applied nearly resonant with a transition from that state , feeding atoms back into the right ground state . radioactive isotopes of most alkali elements ( na , k , rb , cs , fr ) have been trapped .    alkaline earths",
    "can also be trapped with shorter - wavelength e1 transitions if additional lasers are used to remove atoms from metastable states .",
    "barium , which requires complex repumping schemes , has recently been trapped  @xcite .",
    "radium atoms have states with potential enhancements of time - reversal violating electric dipole moment ( edm ) and anapole moment effects  @xcite .",
    "researchers at argonne national lab have succeeded in trapping radium , using a mixed transition at 714 nm with @xmath1510% of an allowed e1 strength  @xcite .    typically , the first four excited states of a noble gas will have two metastable states from which there are single - electron cycling transitions accessible with lasers .",
    "therefore , they can be trapped if the metastable states are first populated by some other method , e.g. by using a penning discharge .",
    "for example , radioactive isotopes of he and kr have been trapped . @xmath30he and",
    "@xmath31he have been trapped by the argonne group , and their charge radii determined via optical isotope shift measurements  @xcite .",
    "trace analysis has been done on long - lived kr isotopes by the same group  @xcite .",
    "other elements can be trapped if sufficient effort is given to the lasers .",
    "laser cooling transitions in a number of unusual species were proposed by shimizu  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite reviews the successfully trapped elements . since that review ,",
    "stable isotopes of ag  @xcite , cr  @xcite , yb  @xcite , and hg  @xcite have been trapped in a mot for studies of clock standards , fermi degenerate gases and bose condensates , and edm searches .",
    "these elements still have relatively simple electronic structures .",
    "in contrast , the complex rare earth atom erbium has now been laser - cooled and trapped  @xcite .",
    "erbium has an optical transition possibly useful for a time standard .",
    "a single - frequency laser was used .",
    "there are more than 50 states between the excited state in the main laser transition and the ground state .",
    "the large atomic angular momentum ( @xmath32 ground state ) makes transitions to most of these states weak , minimizing the loss of population to long - lived low-@xmath33 metastable states .",
    "the high @xmath33 also produces a large atomic magnetic moment , so the weak mot quadrupole field is thought to help contain the atoms during the time they are in metastable states .",
    "this opens the door to trap other complex systems with large atomic angular momentum , for whatever specific cases prove to be useful",
    ".    a rather more exotic possibility would be the trapping of orthopositronium , for which work has been done at tokyo metropolitan university  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this would be a bose - einstein condensate to produce coherent annihilation @xmath34-ray emission  @xcite .",
    "the mot depth is on order one kelvin .",
    "each group trapping radioactive isotopes has invested large efforts to learn to load a mot efficiently in geometries appropriate for their particular experiments .",
    "the creation of the radioactives inherently involves a production target where nuclear reactions produce too much background for any type of experiment , so the isotopes must be transported away from this region .",
    "the final vacuum , desired at the 10@xmath35 torr level , also involves challenges .",
    "the first two groups which trapped radioactives solved these problems in quite different ways , and most efforts since then have made improvements along the same lines .    in the initial stony brook work trapping @xmath36rb  @xcite , a heavy ion beam induced fusion reactions in a foil that was a combination target and surface ionizer .",
    "the products were transported as a low - energy ion beam  @xcite .",
    "the ions were implanted in a surface with a low work function ( yttrium ) to keep the evolving atoms neutral .",
    "the atoms were collimated into an atomic beam feeding a vapor - cell lined with silicone polymer coatings to which the alkali atoms do not stick  @xcite . the vapor cell confined the atoms for many passes through the beams and many chances to be trapped , after re - thermalization upon contact with the walls replenished the low - velocity tail of the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution  @xcite .",
    "the short - lived isotope @xmath37na trapped at berkeley was produced as a collimated atomic beam from a hot magnesium oxide production target .",
    "the atoms were slowed longitudinally by an unopposed laser beam as they traversed inside a tapered solenoid utilizing the zeeman effect to keep the atoms in resonance ( a ` zeeman slower ' ) before they entered the trap  @xcite .",
    "we show the triumf neutral atom trap ( trinat ) system as a typical example for the loading and preparation process  @xcite ( figure  [ behrfig1 ] ) .",
    "a mass - separated 30 kev ion beam from triumf s isac facility  @xcite is stopped in a 900@xmath38c zr foil , adapting a geometry pioneered at los alamos  @xcite to use a conical neutralizer to minimize implantation depth . only atoms moving at less than about @xmath39% of room temperature velocities",
    "can be trapped .",
    "typical efficiencies for trapping atoms in a vapor cell are 0.1 to 1% . to avoid the large radioactive background from untrapped atoms , both in the untrapped vapor and on the walls , 75% of the cooled atoms",
    "are transferred in trinat to a second mot where the experiment takes place .",
    "the transfer time is 25 msec .",
    "details of the transfer process are in  @xcite . for atomic physics experiments on stable species , the two - mot arrangement is also common to improve the vacuum , avoid the small backgrounds from the doppler - broadened vapor , and allow specialized apparatus surrounding the second mot .",
    "vapor - cell mot efficiencies of  50% have been reported in stable species  @xcite , where efficiency is defined as the percentage of incoming atoms that are loaded into the trap .",
    "efficiencies for radioactive species have not exceeded @xmath40 , reported by the los alamos group  @xcite .",
    "possible ways to increase the capture velocity that have been used on stable species include frequency combs farther to the red  @xcite , white light slowing  @xcite , and light - assisted desorption  @xcite .",
    "the mot relies on the emission process being front - back symmetric with respect to absorption , so it is limited by the spontaneous atomic decay rate , and it does not help to increase laser power beyond saturation . stimulated forces , like the bichromatic forces mentioned above  @xcite , have been demonstrated to slow stable cs in one dimension from room temperature over a distance of 10 cm  @xcite , and they have the promise of being limited only by the laser power applied ( admittedly , for many atoms lasers have insufficient power to saturate the spontaneous forces . )",
    "the traps are highly element , isotope , and isomer selective .",
    "for example , at triumf / isac the mass - separated @xmath41 ion beam has 20 times more of the ground state of the isotope @xmath42k ( spin and parity @xmath43=3@xmath44 , t@xmath45@xmath157 minute ) than the nuclear isomer @xmath46k of interest ( @xmath43=0@xmath44 t@xmath45@xmath151 sec ) .",
    "the @xmath43=3@xmath44 nuclear ground state has an atomic ground state hyperfine splitting of 1.4 ghz , and these states straddle equally the location in atomic energy of the 0@xmath3 isomer .",
    "the mot works at frequencies from 5 to 50 mhz to the red of resonance , but more importantly , two frequencies are required to trap the hyperfine - split 3@xmath44 state . hence , the one frequency applied to the mot only traps the 0@xmath44 nuclear isomer .",
    "no recoil-@xmath0 coincidences were observed from the decay of the 3@xmath44 state  @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the use of atom traps for nuclear beta decay , both with spin polarization and without .",
    "we also describe missing - momentum searches for sterile neutrinos in @xmath0 decay and electron capture , along with other exotic particle searches in isomer decay .",
    "we expand informally upon our introduction to @xmath0 decay in section  [ sec - know ] . for a more complete and technical review ,",
    "see  @xcite . at these low momentum transfers ,",
    "@xmath2 decay in the standard model or any extension based on exchange of very massive bosons reduces to a sum of 4-fermion contact interactions  @xcite :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 denotes operators with the five different possible lorentz transformation properties @xmath49  vector ( v ) , axial vector ( a ) , tensor ( t ) , scalar ( s ) , and pseudoscalar ( p )  and implicitly includes all necessary contracted relativistic 4-indices .",
    "this interaction then is invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "the combinations of @xmath50 and @xmath51 produce projection operators @xmath52 which project out either left or right - handed neutrinos . in the standard model , the interaction between quarks and leptons is ` @xmath53 ' , so if we had written the interaction between quarks and leptons , then @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the combination given by exchange of the spin-1 w boson . then only left - handed neutrinos are emitted .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath56 departs from unity as qcd combines quarks into nucleons , but the interaction still produces only left - handed neutrinos .",
    "similarly , though all other constants besides v and a would be zero in the sm quark - lepton interaction , similar terms become in principle allowed again in the nucleon - lepton interaction ; these are termed `` induced ( by qcd ) currents '' .",
    "many of the induced currents would violate what is called g - parity , which reduces to charge symmetry in the first generation of particles , and were therefore termed `` second - class currents '' by weinberg  @xcite and removed from the sm . thus the scalar constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 are still zero in the sm , as they are 2nd - class currents , and they also violate the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis .",
    "in fact fundamental quark - lepton scalars can not be distinguished experimentally from induced scalar interactions  @xcite .",
    "greater care must be taken to distinguish experimentally between tensor non - sm quark - lepton interactions and allowed induced tensor currents . in isobaric",
    "analog decays ( like that of the neutron , or @xmath37na and @xmath59k below ) the extra induced tensor - order interactions are either given by cvc in terms of the electromagnetic moments , or vanish because they are 2nd - class currents  @xcite .",
    "the general expression for the nuclear beta - decay rate @xmath60 in terms of the angular correlations and distributions of the leptons , including the possible spin - polarization of the nucleus , is given ( using lepton momenta @xmath61 and energy @xmath62 and nuclear spin polarization and unit direction @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) by  @xcite :    @xmath65 , \\label{eq - w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 is the fermi function .",
    "we will discuss below trap measurements of the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation coefficient @xmath67 , the @xmath0 asymmetry with respect to spin @xmath68 , the @xmath1 asymmetry with respect to spin @xmath69 , and the time - reversal violating correlation coefficient @xmath70 .",
    "the 2nd - rank tensor alignment term with coefficient @xmath71 occurs for nuclear spin @xmath72 .",
    "explicit expressions for these experimental observables as a function of the @xmath50 constants were worked out in  @xcite , and can be found rewritten in explicitly chiral notation in the review of  @xcite . rather than rewrite these expressions ,",
    "we discuss qualitative features here .",
    "we ignore here observables that measure the spin - polarization of the leptons , as these have not been pursued as yet with traps .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq - w ] ) we can see that the correlations are all normalized by the change in decay strength due to the term @xmath73 .",
    "the decay rate and angular distributions are given by the absolute square of the matrix elements of @xmath74 . that produces cross - terms between new interactions and the sm interactions that are therefore linear in the small new coupling coefficients .",
    "such ` fierz interference terms ' , collected together as @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - w ] ) , always produce left - handed neutrinos , just as the sm does .",
    "so searches confined to them already assume the complete chirality and good time reversal symmetry of the sm .",
    "this is a natural thing to do in many theories , and many limits from particle physics in the literature simply assume this chirality without qualification .",
    "terms are also produced that are squares of the new interactions",
    ". we will give simple arguments below why the beta - neutrino correlation is sensitive to these .",
    "these terms are more general in the sense that they are insensitive to the chirality and time - reversal symmetry properties of the new interactions .    to take an example of an explicit model , one possible source of non - standard model scalar and tensor interactions is supersymmetry .",
    "reference @xcite has shown in a wide variety of susy models that left - right mixing between supersymmetric partners of the first - generation fermions can generate terms as large as 0.001 in the fierz interference scalar - vector and tensor - axial vector terms .",
    "this left - right sfermion mixing is difficult to constrain in particle physics searches .",
    "it is a goal for many of the correlation experiments discussed below to reach such sensitivity .",
    "we also note here one possibly confusing fact : a spin-0 leptoquark ( i.e. a particle explicitly changing leptons into quarks ) can generate both 4-fermion scalar and tensor effective interactions  @xcite .",
    "consequently , a fundamental interaction producing a 4-fermion effective tensor interaction does not imply some very exotic spin-2 particle .      historically , the @xmath0-@xmath1 angular correlation ( the @xmath67 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - w ] ) ) has provided some of the best evidence that the effective contact interaction was primarily vector and axial vector , which in modern theories is due to exchange of the spin-1 bosons .",
    "adelberger pointed out the utility of such measurements in pure fermi decay to constrain scalar interactions  @xcite .",
    "one can make a simple helicity argument to show that @xmath67=1 for these decays .",
    "the leptons are produced with opposite helicity in the standard model interactions .",
    "for @xmath43 = 0@xmath44@xmath750@xmath44 decays , where the leptons must carry off no angular momentum , they can not be emitted back - to - back .",
    "thus these experiments are insensitive to the absolute chirality of the couplings , and only depend on the relative helicity of the two leptons .",
    "they are sensitive to the sums of absolute squares of the scalar or tensor interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq - h ] ) .",
    "although one is measuring the square of small terms , this is a large advantage when looking for wrong - chirality interactions that do not interfere with the standard model s one - sign chirality .",
    "the fierz interference terms also modify the decay rate and therefore the normalization of the angular distribution .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation also has linear sensitivity to some of the new physics .",

    "a scatter plot of 500,000 @xmath78-recoil coincidence events from the decay of @xmath46k is shown in figure  [ fig : betanu ] .",
    "the solid lines are the kinematic loci that would result from back - to - back pointlike detectors .",
    "if the two leptons are emitted in a similar direction , the recoil momentum is very similar ( the @xmath0 s are relativistic so the energy sharing between leptons matters little ) , producing large numbers of events with similar time - of - flight ( tof ) for each charge state .",
    "when the leptons are emitted close to back - to - back , the recoil momenta are much smaller , producing the arcs at longer tof .",
    "one can immediately see qualitatively that the leptons are rarely emitted back - to - back .",

    "it should be stressed that figure  [ fig : weinberg ] can not do justice to the highly complementary nature of the low - energy experiments , as it only plots the sensitivity to one standard model parameter , @xmath151 . since qweak and apv probe different quark combinations and e158 probes leptons , the sensitivities to physics beyond the sm are very different .",
