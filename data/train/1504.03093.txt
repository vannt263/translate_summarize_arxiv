    "ultracold atoms in periodically driven optical lattices , including shaken and amplitude modulated systems , have attracted much attention recent years , for they can bring out new interesting phenomena including realization of artificial gauge fields in different lattice geometries  @xcite and the coherent control of atomic wavefunctions  @xcite . in a shaken one dimensional optical lattice , the ferromagnetic transition in trapped bose gas has also been observed  @xcite by coupling ground band @xmath0 of the lattice system to the first excited band @xmath1 .",
    "specific to amplitude modulated lattice systems , although only bands with the same parity can be coupled , there are still researches on a wide range of problems , such as transfer of atoms from the ground band @xmath0 to the second excited band @xmath2  @xcite , detection of superfluid - mott insulator transition  @xcite and study of the dynamical tunnelling of ultracold atoms with quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "the technique can also be applied in areas including realization of a velocity filter  @xcite and detection of gravity  @xcite .",
    "normally , studies of amplitude modulated lattices are based on single frequency modulations that only involve processes with one photon emission or absorption . during a polychromatic modulation , not only",
    "the amplitudes , but also the phases of different frequency components in the modulation can be controlled independently , providing a more flexible way to coherently manipulate quantum states . in this paper",
    ", we coherently transfer atoms from the ground state @xmath0 to the high excited @xmath3 band via a double frequency modulation .",
    "the peaks of transfer rate with different lattice depths are measured experimentally , while influence of the modulation phase is demonstrated by performing an interference between two independent paths of excitations .",
    "these experiments completely investigated how frequencies and phases of different modulation frequency components would influence the excitation between bloch states .",
    "furthermore , we show an application of the double frequency modulation to build a large - momentum - transfer ( lmt ) beam splitter . comparing with lmt beam splitters based on bloch oscillation  @xcite or high order bragg scattering  @xcite ,",
    "our method is easy in practise and would not introduce phase shift between two separated atom clouds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections  [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] the polychromatic modulation theory based on floquet method and our experimental system are introduced respectively . in section  [ s4 ] ,",
