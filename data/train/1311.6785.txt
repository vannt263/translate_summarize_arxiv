    "the increasing availability of large - scale relational datasets in a variety of fields has led to the widespread analysis of complex networks .",
    "in particular , the current interest in quantitative social sciences has been fuelled by the importance of social networks and by the wealth of socio - economic datasets widely available today  @xcite . due to the sheer complexity of these networks",
    ", it has become crucial to develop tools for network analysis that can increase our insight into such data .",
    "a key direction in this area is that of _ community detection _ , which aims at extracting a simplified , yet",
    "meaningful , coarse - grained representation of a complex network in terms of ` communities ' of nodes at different levels of resolution  @xcite .",
    "a common characteristic of many social , engineering and biological networks is the importance of directionality . clearly , it is not the same to ` follow ' a widely known personality in twitter than to be followed by one .",
    "directionality is also key in food - webs  @xcite , brain networks  @xcite , economics datasets  @xcite , protein interaction networks  @xcite , and trade networks  @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "failure to consider directionality when present in the data , as is commonly done in numerous network analyses , entails ignoring the true nature of the asymmetric relationships and information propagation . from a methodological perspective , however , the analysis of directed networks presents unique challenges that put them beyond standard methodologies .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to extend the structural notion of community ( i.e. , a group of nodes with strong connectivity within and with weaker connectivity to the outside ) to the case of directed networks .",
    "here we show how the analysis of flow patterns on a network can be integrated to provide a framework for community  @xcite and role  @xcite detection .",
    "this framework is naturally applicable to directed networks where flow is an intrinsic feature of the system they represent .",
    "our analysis is able to reveal a layered view of the data from four complementary perspectives : interest communities of nodes at different levels of resolution ; a personalised view of interest in the network from any vantage point ; the identification of user roles in the network based on directed flows ; and a classification of the interest communities into distinctive information organigrams .",
    "our framework is applicable to generic directed networks , but we showcase our approach through the analysis of the twitter network of influential twitter users during the 2011 riots in england , compiled from the list published by the british newspaper the guardian .",
    "the riots of august 6 - 10 2011 in england were followed by an intense public debate about the role and influence of social media during the unrest .",
    "politicians , journalists , pundits and bloggers alike weighed in on the issue but few arguments were based on data  @xcite . a few months after the riots ,",
    "the guardian made available to the public a list of the 1000 ` most influential ' ( i.e. , most _ re - tweeted _ ) twitter users during the riots  @xcite .",
    "the guardian s list comprised a diverse set of twitter users including newspapers , broadcasting services , news agencies , as well as individual accounts of journalists , politicians , entertainers , global and local activists , and members of the public .",
    "to enable a quantitative analysis of the guardian s list , we mined twitter in february 2012 and recovered the _ directed _ network of followers within the list ( see si ) .",
    "henceforth we study the largest connected component of this network consisting of @xmath0 nodes ( twitter users ) .",
    "the remaining 86 users were either disconnected ( i.e. , they did not follow nor were followed by anyone on the list ) or their accounts had been since deleted . in our network , an edge indicates that the source node is subscribed to the _ tweets _ of the target node , i.e. , the direction of the edge indicates the declared interest whereas information and content travel in the opposite direction ( fig .",
    "s1 in the si ) .    ) .",
    "the inset shows the network with nodes and edges coloured according to their community at four illustrative markov times .",
    "two of these partitions at different resolutions are shown in more detail : * b. * at relatively short markov times ( @xmath1 ) we find 149 communities ( coarse - grained network view in the centre ) .",
    "three examples of communities in this partition are ` police and crime reporting ' ( top ) , ` hackney ' ( bottom ) , ` the daily telegraph ' ( left ) shown with their members and their self - description word clouds ; * c. * at longer markov times ( @xmath2 ) we find 4 communities ( coarse - grained view in the centre ) : three large communities broadly corresponding to ` uk ' ( bottom - right ) , ` international ' ( top ) , ` celebrities / entertainment ' ( bottom - left ) , and a small one corresponding to the ` bbc ' ( right )",
    ". a detailed view of the partitions can be found in the si.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "to gain a structured view of the communities in the network at different levels of resolution , we use markov stability community detection  @xcite which has been extended to deal with directed networks ( see methods , si and ref .",
    "a key advantage of markov stability is that it is based on a quantitative criterion that relies on flow propagation and containment , and thus identifies _",
    "flow communities_. the communities so found correspond to ` interest communities ' , insomuch as information , interest and influence are propagated , retained and reinforced within them following the edges .",
    "if edge directionality is ignored , the community structure is blurred and the analysis severely hindered , as shown below .",
    "a second advantage of our method is that the network is scanned for structure at all scales , and flow communities are found to be relevant at different levels of resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : communities]a illustrates how , as the network is swept by a continuous - time diffusion process , the method goes from detecting many small , granular communities ( at short markov times ) to fewer and coarser communities ( at longer markov times ) . as a visual aid to interpret the theme of the communities , we create ` word clouds ' from the most frequently - used words in the twitter self - biographies of the users in each community .",
    "it is important to remark that the biographies are not used in the network analysis , i.e. , the word clouds serve as an independent , _ a posteriori _ annotation or ` self - description ' of the communities found ( see si ) .",

    "some communities are defined by the geographic origin of the twitter accounts ( e.g. , midlands , manchester , liverpool , even croydon and hackney within london ) ; others are determined by employer or institution ( e.g. , media such as the independent , itv , channel  4 , or the daily telegraph ) ; while others correspond to interest groups ( e.g. , a community grouping together police forces and fire departments of riot areas with crime reporters and civil organisations highlights the police s use of twitter during the riots  @xcite ) .    as the markov time increases",

    ", we find a partition into 15 communities including the bbc community , a sky community , a community of guardian journalists , a community of international and alternative media / journalists / activists ( including wikileaks , al jazeera , and anonymous - related accounts ) , among other topical communities ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : bbcr4today ] , we show how the community of bbc s today show ( a morning news broadcast with a broad audience ) remains consistently grouped across many levels of resolution in the analysis of the directed network : from an early markov time , bbc - related accounts are grouped together and remain so all the way up to the top levels of resolution , with consistent word clouds throughout .",
    "this phenomenon depends strongly on the directionality of the flows : the nodes in the bbc community are among the most important in the network ( high in - degree and pagerank ) , attracting flow ( attention ) from elsewhere in the network and retaining it for long periods of markov time . in a symmetrised network ,",
    "such communities can go undetected , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbcr4today ] , where the corresponding undirected community of the bbc s today show is quickly blurred across markov times and gets mixed with a variety of users with little in common , consisting mainly of politicians from the labour party and journalists .",
    "interestingly , this drastic difference between directed and undirected communities is not observed for all communities in the network .",
    "there are communities , such as the one including guardian columnist george monbiot , which behave in an essentially similar fashion in both cases across levels of resolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : georgemonbiot_size_comparison ] ) .",
    "this difference between communities that are sensitive or insensitive to directionality persists across time scales , signalling the fact that some groupings ( such as the bbc community ) are fundamentally based on retention of directed flows , while others ( such as the monbiot community ) follow from a balanced flow and , thus , can be captured by standard undirected measures .",
    "we note that the directed markov stabilty method is able to detect both types of communities simultaneously .    ,",

    "[ fig : interest_distance]a , we show the computed interest distance from the vantage point of the anonymous community ( from @xmath9 onwards ) .",
    "consistent with other studies  @xcite , the closest nodes to anonymous include wikileaks , human rights watch , al  jazeera and amnesty international , followed by a mix of activists and writers , mainstream international media , and the uk media .",
    "of least interest to anonymous are celebrities , uk politicians and footballers .",
    "unsurprisingly , the picture is starkly different from the vantage point of the nodes that are of least interest to anonymous .",
    "figure  [ fig : interest_distance]b shows the interest distance from the vantage point of footballer wayne rooney ( of little interest to anonymous ) whose neighbourhood of interest is dominated by football , sports and tv celebrities , with news and activists as distant interests .",
    "the computed interest distance is able to capture the nuanced information provided by all the directed paths in the network .",
    "this is shown by the fact that stephen fry ( english actor , tv personality and writer ) is distant from _ both _ wayne rooney and anonymous ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interest_distance]b ) , while rio ferdinand ( rooney s ex - teammate at manchester united ) is always close to rooney .",
    "these examples highlight the sensitivity of our markov exploration and how the use of vantage points can be used to provide personalised information about the system .",
    "a flow - based analysis of directed networks also provides a different angle for the classification of nodes according to their role in generating and disseminating information .",
    "conceptually , it is clear that an account with millions of followers , such as bbc news , acts as a source of information ( i.e. , a reference ) while a personal account with only a handful of followers yet with subscriptions to media outlets acts mostly as a sink of information ( i.e. , a listener ) . to go beyond this source /",
    "sink dichotomy , or the traditional leader / follower and hub / authority  @xcite categories , we use here the full structure of flows in the network to develop a quantitative methodology that reveals ` flow roles ' in the network without imposing the number of roles _ a priori_. our algorithm starts by building the _ role - based similarity _ ( rbs ) matrix ( see methods below )  @xcite .",
    "a feature vector for each node @xmath10 is constructed from the scaled pattern of incoming and outgoing paths of _ all lengths _ and the pairwise cosine similarities ( @xmath11 $ ] ) between all such vectors ( see methods ) are stored in the @xmath12 similarity matrix @xmath13 .",
    "nodes with similar profiles of incoming and outgoing flows of all lengths are classified as having similar _ flow roles _ in the network ( i.e. , when @xmath14 is close to 1 ) .",
    "the extreme cases correspond to the standard sources and sinks , but an assortment of nuanced roles spanning these two extremes emerges in our results .",
    "this analysis provides a complementary use of flows to infer different properties of nodes : instead of grouping nodes according to flow persistence ( as in the detection of interest communities described above ) , rbs provides a grouping of nodes according to their function in information propagation .",
    "we have extended the rbs method by using the relaxed minimum spanning tree ( rmst ) algorithm to extract a _ role similarity graph _ from the matrix @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : riot1000-rbs - t97]a ) .",
    "this novel algorithm creates a new graph by emphasising strong similarities between nodes and downplaying weaker , redundant similarities based on local continuity and global geometric properties of the data similarity @xmath13 ( see methods ) .",
    "note that in this rmst - rbs role similarity graph ( which is generated from the twitter graph but is distinct from it ) , nodes with similar connectivity patterns lie close to each other regardless of how close they are ( in a geodesic way ) in the original network .",
    "we then apply graph - theoretical community detection algorithms ( such as markov stability ) to the rmst - rbs graph and , in doing so , we reveal groups of nodes ( the communities in the role similarity graph ) with similar in- and out - flow patterns corresponding to _ flow - based roles_. the number of communities on the role similarity graph correspond to the number of roles in the network .",
    "note that this procedure does not impose an _ a priori _ number of roles to be detected ( see si ) .",
    "our rmst - rbs analysis finds that there are five flow - based roles for the nodes in this twitter network .",
    "examination of their incoming and outgoing flow patterns reveals that some of the groups identified correspond to traditional roles such as _ listeners _ ( ` followers ' ) or _ references _ ( ` leaders ' ) , but also distinguishes between different types of leaders , followers and intermediate roles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : riot1000-rbs - t97]a - b ) .",
    "the description of the five flow role categories we obtained is as follows :    1 .",
    "* references : * typically , institutional accounts , important sources of content , or well - known personalities with many followers who follow few accounts , e.g. , bbc breaking news , al jazeera , stephen fry , or the new york times .",
    "* engaged leaders : * accounts with large number of followers who , unlike references , also follow other users .",
    "this category includes institutional and personal accounts often meant to interact with the public , e.g. , sky news , the british prime minister s office , tom watson ( a british mp ) , or paul lewis ( guardian editor ) .",
    "* mediators : * users who interact with the two leader categories ( i.e. , they follow and are followed by high profile accounts ) , as well as with nodes in the listener categories below .",
    "many such accounts belong to journalists and reporters .",
    "examples of mediators include ross chainey ( reuters employee ) , bbc - have - your - say and the london fire brigade .",
    "4 .   * diversified listeners : * accounts with few followers that follow many nodes from all categories , suggesting diversity in their interests and sources of information . 5 .   *",
    "listeners : * accounts with few followers ( within this network , not necessarily over the whole of twitter ) who follow mostly reference nodes . within this particular network , they can be considered as passive recipients of mainstream content .    in the supplemental spreadsheet",
    "we give the roles of all nodes in the network .",
    "we remark that this classification of nodes into roles is pertinent _ only _ in the context of the network within the guardian s list ; it is possible that the role of certain users will be different if considered embedded in the wider twitter network , since the pattern of paths of different lengths attached to each node is likely to change .",
    "figure  [ fig : riot1000-rbs - t97]c illustrates the mathematical basis for the classification of nodes into roles by our rmst - rbs algorithm : the patterns of incoming and outgoing flow at all path lengths are combined to reveal the different flow roles . because rmst - rbs takes into account the whole spectrum of short to long paths ( from length 1 to @xmath15 in this case , and everything in between ) our classification goes beyond similarity scores that only use single features , such as in- and out - degrees of the nodes ( which appear as the paths of length 1 in columns 1 and @xmath16 of the matrix @xmath17 in equation  ( [ eq : rbs ] ) ) or eigencentrality - type stationary flow metrics ( columns @xmath18 and @xmath19 )",
    ". therefore our method obtains information which is not apparent if we just rank the nodes according to in / out degree or centrality and then split them into groups . for example , ranking the nodes according to pagerank is not enough to distinguish the ` reference ' and ` engaged leader ' categories , or to separate mediator from engaged leader or diversified listener ( see fig .",
    "s8 in the si and supplemental spreadsheet ) . to confirm the relevance of our findings",
    ", we examine the cumulative distribution of retweets attained by each node class ( fig .",
    "[ fig : riot1000-rbs - t97]d ) , where we see a clear separation between the leader ( reference and engaged leader nodes ) and follower ( diversified listeners and listeners ) categories , with the mediators lying in between both groups .",
    "it is important to remark that the retweet data in fig .",
    "[ fig : riot1000-rbs - t97]d is not part of our role detection and is only used _ a posteriori _ to inform our understanding of the flow roles obtained ( see also fig .",
    "s8 in the si ) .",
    "the flow roles we find here are conceptually and practically different from those obtained using well established theories in social network analysis , e.g. structural equivalence ( se )  @xcite and regular equivalence ( re )  @xcite .",
    "se bases node similarity on overlapping sets of neighbours ( i.e. , two nodes are similar if many of their neighbours are the same ) , while re - based methods rely on node colorations and neighbourhoods ( i.e. , two nodes have the same role if the colours of their neighbours are the same , regardless of the number of common neighbours ) .",
    "hence se and re are essentially short - path methods and not suitable for networks like the one studied here where the full structure of flow is essential ( see si for a detailed description of re and se roles and their lack of information content in this network ) .",
    "furthermore , re methods are not robust to small random perturbations in network connectivity due to their combinatorial nature .    .",
    "the communities reflect a diverse set of topical groupings ( see word clouds with the top 50 nontrivial words in the user biographies ) and are characterised by different mixes of the five flow roles , as shown by the pie charts .",
    "the organigrams range from reference - listener schemes ( ` broadcast ' and ` monologue ' ) to more balanced dialogue communities ( ` engaged dialogue ' and ` dialogue in public ' ) in which engaged leaders , mediators and diversified listeners dominate .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]      heretofore , our two - pronged flow - based analysis has led to groupings of the nodes according to two criteria : interest communities ( at different resolutions ) and flow roles .",
    "both perspectives present complementary views of the information in the network and can be combined to characterise the internal organisation of interest communities in terms of the mix of roles of their members .",
    "figure  [ fig : organigram ] presents this integrated view for the 15 interest communities at medium resolution ( markov time @xmath4 ) , and the five node roles found through rbs - rmst . using a simple @xmath20-means clustering of their role - mixes , we find that the 15 communities fall into four types of informational organigrams ( see si ) .",
    "two of these organigrams broadly conform to communities formed mostly by leaders ( ` references ' ) and their followers ( ` listeners ' ) , though with some important differences : _ `` monologue communities '' _ are predominantly composed of references with a set of loyal ( non diversified ) listeners with information flowing mostly in one direction ( e.g. , ` celebrities / entertainers ' , ` sport ' , parody accounts ) , while in _ `` broadcast communities '' _ most members are references delivering content broadly to a wide variety of users in the network ( e.g ` bbc ' and ` international media ' ) .",
    "in addition , there exist two organigrams with a more balanced dialogue structure :",
    "_ `` dialogue in public '' _ , which involves many diversified listeners ( e.g. , ` panel show celebrities ' , ` london ' , or groups heavily based on internet interaction such as ` uk journalists & activists ' ) ; and _ `` engaged dialogue '' _ , which is dominated by engaged leaders and mediators ( e.g. , ` politics ' and ` the guardian ' ) .",
    "these two dialogue organigrams reflect the importance of online interaction in information networks , where bottom - up grassroots associations , bloggers and commentators from the public interact directly with accounts linked to news outlets and official political organisations .",
    "in this work , we have used the twitter network constructed from the list of influential users during the uk riots of 2011 collected by the guardian to showcase how flow - based methods in directed networks can lead to enhanced insight into the structure of data .",
    "our analysis reveals interest communities into which users fall at different levels of resolution .",
    "the interest communities found confirm the relevance of news organisations and media , yet providing a layered view in terms of their focus ( uk / international , mainstream / alternative ) and of relationships to each other and to the overall network .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity of our multi - resolution analysis allows us to uncover small but significant groups related to local organisations or clean - up groups in riot areas which appear close to police and law enforcement groupings .",
    "in addition , our analysis reveals groupings that have an unexpected relevance in a network that was selected on the basis of ` retweeting ' importance during an event of civil unrest .",
    "in particular , a significant grouping of celebrities , sport personalities and pop musicians act as the center of a significant interest community . also intriguing",
    "is the role of interest groups based on humour in such situations , as represented by communities of comedians and parody accounts .",
    "our work points at future studies on how to use this type of analyses to improve and tailor communication strategies during times of unrest , in particular with regards to providing a personalised view of the network from any given vantage point ( i.e. , from any node or group of nodes ) based on the interest distance of information flow .",
    "these results can be a starting point to examine textual information and analyse the influence of groups of interest on observed behaviors in this and similar datasets .",
    "using flow transfer in the network , we find that the twitter users in this network fall into a palette of five flow roles , whereas interest communities exhibit distinct mixes of such roles reflecting diverse communication patterns within them .",
    "some communities contain one - way communication patterns ( e.g. , celebrities and their followers ) , whereas other communities harbour more balanced dialogue patterns .",
    "in particular , our analysis highlights the differences between media organisations and their distinct patterns of interaction with the influential users in this network .",
    "for instance , international mainstream media tend to fall into the broadcast and monologue categories , as would be expected in a network of uk - based events .",
    "on the other hand , the uk and specialised media exhibit a more diverse pattern of interactions with their followers : some of them are highly engaged with mediators and diversified listeners whereas others largely maintain the more traditional role of publishing content .",
    "this work also highlights the use of multiscale network analyses , which go beyond local information of individual users towards aggregate global metrics , to deliver an enriched view of information dissemination in social networks , thus uncovering relationships and roles of nodes and providing concise coarse - grained descriptions of the network .",
    "we hope that our results ( all available in the supplemental material ) could be a helpful resource to aid in the study of online interactions during the uk riots of 2011 .",
    "more generally , our work highlights the importance of directionality in network analysis .",
    "when the notion of flows ( e.g. , of people , information , energy , goods ) is central to a network , ignoring directionality destroys information , ` blurring ' the structure , especially at the finer levels of resolution , so that key communities ( e.g. , the bbc , sky , and geographical communities in our analysis ) will go undetected .",
    "the formulation of community and role detection in terms of flow dynamics thus provides an integrated methodology for the analysis of systems ( natural or man - made ) with directed network representations .",
    "we give here a summary of the theoretical ideas and computations underpinning our analysis of interest communities using directed markov stability . for a full explanation of the method , see refs .",

    "we have recently introduced the community detection method known as _",
    "the basic idea is that the study of the dynamics of diffusion processes on networks can be used to identify meaningful partitions at different resolutions  @xcite .",
    "this notion can be illustrated by the example of observing how a droplet of ink would diffuse in a container .",
    "if the container has no structure , the ink diffuses isotropically .",
    "if the container is compartmentalised , the dye would not spread isotropically but would rather get transiently trapped for longer times in certain parts of the container until it eventually becomes evenly distributed throughout the whole vessel .",
    "hence the time dynamics of this diffusion process provides us with valuable information about the structural organisation of the container .",
    "a similar idea can be applied to the diffusion on a graph .    from this dynamical perspective",
    ", the markov time acts as a means to scan the structure of the graph _ at all scales _",
    ", thus providing a dynamical zooming over the structure of the graph . in this process of zooming , the diffusion explores increasingly larger sections of the graph and identifies increasingly coarser partitions .",
    "communities are identified as subgroups within which the probability flow is well mixed yet the flow remains contained over particular time scales .",
    "the communities are found by finding the partitions that optimise a time - dependent cost function .",
    "as the diffusion progresses , this cost function optimisation allows us to rank the goodness of partitions and to identify which partitions are relevant over different time scales .",
    "relevant partitions appear as robust , because they are optimal over extended time - intervals and/or in terms of the basin of attraction of the optimisation process .",

    "we begin with a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) as the initial backbone of the graph , and we add edges iteratively using the following simple heuristic ( note that the mst is such that the sum of edges in the tree is minimal , and a path in the mst is the path between two nodes that minimises the maximal edge weight ) . at each step of the iteration , we consider whether the mst path between any pair of nodes @xmath10 and @xmath24 is a significantly better model compared to the direct edge @xmath90 .",
    "if the maximal edge weight in the mst path is significantly smaller than @xmath90 , the mst path is considered a better model based on the continuity achieved through short distances . if , on the contrary , the maximal edge weight along the mst path is comparable to @xmath90 , then we consider that there is not sufficient evidence to say that the mst path is a better model for data continuity and we add an edge between @xmath10 and @xmath24 in the rmst .",
    "therefore , the edges in the rmst are generated as : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the maximal edge weight in the mst path between nodes @xmath10 and @xmath24 , @xmath93 is the distance from node @xmath10 to its @xmath20-th nearest neighbour , and @xmath94 is a positive constant ( here , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",

    "furthermore , it is only based on the consideration of the coloration of immediate neighbourhoods of each node .",
    "hence it leads to a very different classification of roles to that obtained with the rmst - rbs algorithm .",
    "we have obtained the roles of nodes in the riots network obtained using re models , and compared them to the rmst - rbs roles obtained above . to obtain the re classes we use two",
    "well - known algorithms : rege  @xcite , which obtains similarities between the nodes based on re , and excatre  @xcite which produces a sequence of regular ( or approximately regular ) colorations .",
    "we have included the excatre and rege partitions in the supplemental spreadsheet .",
    "the excatre algorithm applied to the riots network finds only one non - trivial coloration with 734 roles .",
    "( two trivial colorations are also obtained : all nodes with the same colour and each node with its own colour . ) on closer investigation , the roles identified by excatre correspond trivially to nodes with identical in and out - degree , and hence it corresponds to considering only immediate neighbourhoods in the graph ( i.e. , it would be found by rmst - rbs setting both @xmath78 and @xmath18 equal to 1 so that only paths of length one are considered ) . in our analysis above , we used @xmath83 ( which converges at @xmath15 ) , and the roles obtained by rmst - rbs incorporate global flow information from the graph .",
    "the rege algorithm iteratively constructs a similarity matrix between nodes based on the similarities between their neighbours .",
    "the similarity matrix is then clustered using hierarchical clustering techniques to obtain roles  @xcite .",
    "we apply the rege algorithm to the riots network ( which converges after 6 iterations ) and obtain five clusters ( or roles ) with 806 , 59 , 46 , 2 and 1 nodes each .",
    "these roles are not informative : the cluster with 59 nodes contains all the source nodes ( in - degree 0 ) ; the cluster with 46 nodes contains all the sink nodes ( out - degree 0 ) ; while almost all the nodes in the network fall in the cluster with 806 nodes which lies between them .",
    "the two small clusters with 2 and 1 nodes lie in slightly different positions with respect to the sink and node clusters . as with excatre",
    ", these roles are the result of an analysis based on immediate neighbourhoods ( in and out - paths of length one ) .",
    "although re - based methods and rmst - rbs attempt to find roles in networks , their conceptual foundation is different .",
    "both approaches aim to identify the ` types ' of nodes that exist in the network ( allowing for the possibility that two nodes on opposite ends of the network and no common neighbours could be of the same type ) but they use different information to do so .",
    "re - based methods analyse the similarities between neighbourhoods under colorations , while rmst - rbs identifies similarities in the transient pattern of long - range flows though each node .",
    "because of the use of flows at all scales in the network , from local to global neighbourhoods , the rmst - rbs method provides a more balanced classification into node classes .",
    "in addition , rmst - rbs is less sensitive to small changes in connectivity , and thus more robust for the analysis of realistic networks .",
    "for example , if we create an edge from a node in the 806-node rege cluster to the 59-node cluster of sources ( e.g. , when a twitter user decides to follow  another user ) , this node would change roles immediately . hence in this specific context ,",
    "a re - based analysis of the network is non robust .",
    "our two analyses ( interest communities and user roles ) can be brought together to classify the informational organisation of communities , as given by the different mix of roles within each community . in fig .",
    "6 of the main text we show that the 15 communities obtained at @xmath4 can be broadly classified into four organigrams , which go from a purely broadcast community ( of references and listeners ) to other communities that involve dialogue between engaged leaders , mediators and diversified listeners .",
    "the four organigrams were found by using the mix of roles of each community ( a five - dimensional vector containing the proportion of nodes in the community that belong to each role - class ) and performing a simple k - means clustering on the communities . in other words , each community can be represented by a point inside the unit cube in @xmath122 , and with k - means we identify the clusters of communities whose role mixes are similar .                , _ proximity graphs for clustering and manifold learning _ , in advances in neural information processing systems 17 , l.  k. saul , y.  weiss , and l.  bottou , eds . , mit press , cambridge , ma , 2005 , pp .  225232 .              ,",
