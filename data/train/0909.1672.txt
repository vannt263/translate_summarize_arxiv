    "we incorporate virtual crossings into this model as generalized swap gates .",
    "this allows us to extend and compute quantum topological invariants to the category of virtual links . in the context of quantum computation",
    ", the anyonic model can be used to compute the jones polynomial of knots and links .",
    "incorporating virtual crossings as generalized swap gates leads to a model that can be used as a quantum algorithm for the jones polynomial of virtual links .",
    "virtual crossings can be incorporated into the fibonacci model , but the calculus described in @xcite is no longer sufficient to left associate an arbitrarily constructed virtual tree . in this paper , we extend the graphical calculus to virtual braided trees .",
    "recall artin s @xmath0-strand braid group , @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the generators of @xmath3 .",
    "the generators of @xmath4 , the four strand braid group , are illustrated in figure [ fig : genbraid ] .",
    "= 0.75 in    the @xmath0-strand braid group is determined by the following relations on the generators :    * @xmath5 * @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "these relations determine equivalent braids , via the reidemeister ii and iii moves , as shown in figure [ fig : relations ] .",

    "we incorporate virtual crossings by adding the generators @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a @xmath0-strand braid with a single virtual crossing between strand @xmath11 and strand @xmath12 as shown in figure [ fig : virtual ] .",
    "= 0.75 in    equivalence classes of virtual braids are determined by the following relations .    * @xmath13 * @xmath14 * @xmath15 * @xmath16 .",
    "diagrammatically , these relations are illustrated in figure [ fig : visquare ] .",
    "unitary solutions to the yang - baxter equation @xcite determine unitary representations of the braid group .",
    "( recall that these solutions are universal . )",
    "we assume that these representations act on a tensor product ; each strand of a braid represents a finite dimensional ( usually two dimensional ) vector space @xmath17 .",
    "then in the context of the braid group , order two gates that switch strands lead to the usual definition of the swap gate .",
    "that is , in an @xmath0-dimensional vector space @xmath17 with basis , @xmath18 , an element of @xmath19 is a qudit and a swap gate sends @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "this extends the ( tensor ) representation of the braid group to the virtual braid group .",
    "however , we are not working within the context of a tensor representation but instead with a representation that acts on vector spaces associated with trees .",
    "the version of the swap gate that we study here is an order two unitary operator .",
    "these generalized swap gates also satisfy the relations in the virtual braid group .",
    "these gates also have a more complex behavior than the usual definition of a swap gate , a behavior that we will examine later in this paper .",
    "= 1.5 in    a tensor representation of the braid group corresponding to @xmath22 , where @xmath17 is a two dimensional vector space , can be extended with the matrix defined on @xmath23 : @xmath24 this is the usual swap gate .",
    "the fibonacci model is based on the evaluation of associated trees . in a left associated tree ,",
    "trivalent vertices represent particle interactions and each edge is marked with either a @xmath25 or @xmath26 ; representing the two possible states of a particle .",
    "the uppermost edges are labeled with @xmath27 s and lower edges are labeled with either a @xmath27 or a @xmath28 , based on the outcome of a particle interaction .",
    "the three possible particle interactions are : @xmath29 a left associated tree labeled in this fashion is shown in figure [ fig : lefttree ] .",
    "= 1 in    since the upper leaves of the tree are labeled with @xmath27 , it follows that @xmath30 is an impossible sequence of labels .",
    "the space of the left associated trees with @xmath31 upper branches has dimension @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 represents the @xmath34 fibonacci number ) . using the graphical calculus from the temperly - lieb algebra @xcite , @xcite",
    ", any classical , braided tree can be transformed into a left associated tree .",
    "however , the operations provided by this graphical calculus are not sufficient to transform a virtually braided tree into a left associated tree .",
    "this is the problem that concerns us in this paper .",
    "the skein relation and the 2-strand recoupler from the temperly - lieb algebra are illustrated in figure [ fig : graphcalc1 ] .",
    "= 2 in    these two equations form the basis for all calculations in the remainder of this paper . here",
    "@xmath35 .",
    "= 2 in    labeled trees correspond to elements of the @xmath36-strand temperly - lieb recoupling theory as shown in figure [ fig : trivalent ] . in this context ,",
    "an edge labeled with @xmath27 corresponds to an edge consisting of two strands and an edge labeled with @xmath26 corresponds to edge with zero strands ( that is , the edge does not exist except as a placeholder ) .",
    "graphically , the edges labeled with @xmath26 may be represented with a dashed edge .",
    "the left association of any classical braided tree only requires two operations : the f transformation and the r transformation .",
    "the f transformation is a linear transformation from the set of labeled trees to the set of labeled trees .",
    "recall @xcite and let @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the evaluation of a loop with a projector , @xmath39 is the evaluation of a @xmath40-graph involving trivalent vertices , and @xmath41 is the evaluation of a tetrahedral graph with trivalent vertices . an f transformation results in a linear combination of labeled trees , as shown in figure [ fig : ftrans ] .",
    "= 1.5 in    [ fig : ftrans ]    here @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , see @xcite . from the point of view of linear algebra ,",
    "each labeled tree is a basis vector in a complex vector space associated with a single , unlabeled tree . in the case of those trees which standardly have @xmath27 s labeling their upper branches , the basis vectors consist of all legal labelings of the other edges .",
    "an unlabeled tree represents the vector space of all possible labelings of the tree .",
    "the f transformation is a unitary linear transformation from the vector space of one tree to the other tree obtained by performing the replacement indicated in figure [ fig : ftrans ] .    suppressing the information about the labels and coefficients",
    ", we can describe the f transformation graphically as shown in figure [ fig : recoupling ] .",
    "= 1 in    = 1.5 in    similarly , we can apply the r transformation to two adjacent branches with a classical crossing and obtain a multiple of a tree without twisting as shown in figure [ fig : requiv ] .",
    "as in @xcite , we describe @xmath46 and @xmath47 by the matrices @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "in models of quantum computation , swap gates exchange two particles .",
    "the effect of a swap gate on two particles is : @xmath50 in virtual braided trees , a line with a dot corresponds to two edges with a virtual crossing leading into a projector .",
    "a line of this type is labeled with a @xmath51 as shown in figure [ fig : zz ] .            resolving the virtual crossing results in 2 strand edges with a virtual crossing between the edges .",
    "this represents a third particle type , referred to as @xmath51 and indicated in the graphs with a solid dot .",
    "we realize that virtual crossings effect not only the coefficient , but also the labeling of the tree .",
    "the particles interact as follows : @xmath52      this illustrates the more complex behavior of our generalized swap gates . in the virtual case , left association",
    "may alter the labels on the edges of the tree .",
    "that is , given an arbitrarily constructed virtual tree with all branches labeled @xmath27 then , after left association , it is possible to obtain a tree where the upper branches are labeled with @xmath27 or @xmath53 .",
    "this does not occur in the classical case . in the following ,",
    "we develop a calculus that may be applied in order to left associate a virtual tree , resulting in the following theorem .      in order to prove this theorem",
    ", we will first prove a sequence of lemmas .",
    "first , we determine how to express the tree with an edge labeled @xmath53 shown in [ fig : base ] as a linear combination of labeled , left associated trees .",
    "we can left associate a tree with an edge labeled @xmath53 .",
    "the virtual tree shown on the left hand side of figure [ fig : leftassoc ] is equivalent to the sum of left associated trees shown on the right hand side .",
    "we then apply the f transformation until we obtain a linear combination of trees that are left associated , with the exception of the bubble on the left hand branch .",
    "we then rewrite the linear combination of trees using the bubble calculation to obtain the linear combination shown in figure [ fig : leftassoc ] .",
    "the coefficients of the trees shown in figure [ fig : leftassoc ] are : @xmath54        * proof : * the tree on the right hand side of figure [ fig : doubletwist ] is equivalent to a classical tree to which we can apply the r transformation .",
    "the tree shown on the left hand side of figure [ fig : doubletwist ] can be expressed as a linear combination of two trees after some calculations .",
    "* proof : * expanding the recouplers in figure [ fig : dt1 ] , we obtain the equivalences shown in figure [ fig : inter ] . from this computation",
    ", we obtain the equivalence shown in figure [ fig : doubletwist ] .",
    "we need only determine how to left associate trees with a classical crossing and an edge labeled @xmath53 as shown in figure [ fig : lastcase ] .",
    "these relations are determined by using the expansion shown in figure [ fig : doubleexpand ] and simplifying .",
    "these additional operations , combined with the f transformation and r transformation , are sufficient to left associate all virtual , braided trees",
    ". we have proved theorem [ the ] . in order to utilize this graphical calculus in the context of models of quantum computation",
    ", we must extend the basis and determine matrix representations of these relations and the dimension of the space of left associated virtual trees .",
    "these linear transformations relating trees must also be described as unitary matrices .",
    "we will explore these linear representations in a subsequent paper . note that the calculus that we have constructed so far contains new order two gates that fit into a representation of the virtual braid group .",
    "these gates ( being of order two ) can be regarded as generalizations of a simple swap gate .",
    "the use we intend for these swap gates are for extensions of topological quantum invariants and the jones polynomial to virtual links .",
    "the gates may be of use in topological quantum computing in general since the original fibonacci model is universal for quantum computing ."
