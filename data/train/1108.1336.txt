    "a proper phase transition takes place only in the idealised limit of an infinite number of interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "although this limit is never realised in the laboratory ( let alone in numerical simulations ) , everyday experience suggests that macroscopic samples are infinite for all practical purposes .",
    "spin glasses  @xcite are an exception .",
    "the problem lies in their sluggish dynamics at the critical temperature and below .",
    "the system remains for very long times , or forever , out of equilibrium .",
    "in fact , letting the system relax for about one hour , the spatial size of the glassy magnetic domains is ( at most ) of the order of one hundred lattice spacings  @xcite .",
    "it has become clear lately that , in order to interpret experimental data in spin glasses , the relevant equilibrium properties are those of systems of size similar to that of the experimentally achievable coherence length  @xcite . phase transitions on finite systems are actually crossover phenomena describable through the well known theory of finite size scaling ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , a conspicuous feature of disordered systems ( and most notably , of spin glasses ) is to undergo strong sample - to - sample fluctuations in many thermodynamic properties .",
    "it is thus natural to ask questions about the probability distribution , induced by the disorder , of the various physical quantities .",
    "typically the size of these fluctuations decreases when enlarging the size of the equilibrated system ; if we wish to have hints about their possible relevance in experimental systems , it is important to know the rate at which fluctuations decrease with system size . this is particularly important if we are to study dynamical heterogeneities  @xcite in spin glasses  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a relevant but elusive physical quantity ( potentially relevant to analyse dynamical effects close to the phase transition ) is the finite - system pseudo - critical temperature .",
    "our scope here is to characterise its statistical properties in spin glasses .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied and is well understood for finite - size weakly bond - disordered spin models , below the upper critical dimension @xmath0 . for a system of size @xmath1 and a disorder sample @xmath2 , one can define a pseudo - critical temperature @xmath3 as the location of the maximum of a relevant susceptibility : this definition is clearly non unique , but all sensible definitions lead to the same scaling behaviour as @xmath4 . according to the harris criterion  @xcite , a major role  @xcite is played here by the value of the thermal critical exponent of the pure system , @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 the disorder is irrelevant , the value of @xmath7 is not modified by the disorder ( i.e. @xmath8 ) , and the width @xmath9 of the probability distribution of the pseudo - critical temperature , defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the disorder average , behaves as @xmath12 as expected naively  @xcite . in such a situation in the infinite volume limit the ( disorder induced ) fluctuations of @xmath3 are negligible with respect to the width of the critical region and to the finite - size shift of @xmath13 , that both behave like @xmath14 . in the other case , when @xmath15 .",
    "disorder is relevant , the value of @xmath7 for the disordered model is different from @xmath5 and obeys  @xcite the bound @xmath16 . in this case",
    "@xmath9 , the width of the critical region , and the finite - size shift of @xmath13 behave like @xmath17 .",
    "the behaviour @xmath18 that would be naively dominant is destroyed by the disorder .",
    "the case of weakly bond - disordered spin models above the upper critical dimension needs a very careful analysis , as shown in  @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the distribution of the pseudo - critical temperature in finite size spin glass models has not been studied numerically before : this is the object of the present note .",
    "recent analytical work has predicted @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the number of spins , i.e. the system volume ) for the ( mean field ) sherrington - kirkpatrick model ( sk ) for spin glasses  @xcite : we establish in this note that the realised scenario is indeed different . very recently , while this work was being completed , ref .",
    "@xcite has also tried ( and failed ) to verify numerically the analytical predictions of  @xcite . a former attempt to analyse",
    "numerically the distribution of the pseudo - critical temperature in the sk model was useful to investigate the numerical techniques of choice  @xcite .    here , we present numerical results both for the three - dimensional ( @xmath21 ) and the mean - field sk spin glass models . in the @xmath21 case ,",
    "we show that the probability distribution of pseudo - critical temperatures verifies finite size scaling . from the scaling of this distribution",
    "we obtain a precise estimate of the critical temperature and of the critical exponent for the correlation length , @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    ", we find that for the mean - field spin glass @xmath22 ( in agreement with analytical findings for the scaling with @xmath20 of disordered - averaged quantities in mean field models  @xcite ) .",
    "since this is in plain contradiction with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we briefly revisit their analytical argument and show where the error in  @xcite stems from .",
    "we also believe that a second analytic conclusion of  @xcite , stating that the @xmath23 is distributed according to a tracy widom probability law , is based on very shaky grounds , and we will give hints of the fact that it is not substantiated numerically .    our first step is to define a pseudo - critical temperature for a given finite - size sample .",
    "random bond and site diluted models allow  @xcite a straightforward definition of @xmath3 as the location of the maximum of the relevant susceptibility @xmath24 . in our case",
    "the situation is more complex ( even if , as we will see , the analysis of the spin glass susceptibility @xmath25 will be very useful and revealing ) . here the relevant diverging quantity is  @xcite @xmath25 @xmath26 ( where the @xmath27 are the local spin variables ) that is of order @xmath20 in the whole low temperature phase .",
    "@xmath25 is a continuously decreasing function of the temperature , and has no peak close to @xmath13 : this requires , as we will discuss in the following , a slightly more sophisticated analysis in order to extract a pseudo critical temperature .",
    "an alternative and simpler procedure is very straightforward : let us introduce it first .",
    "we first assume ( as done in  @xcite ) that for a given disorder sample @xmath2 the finite - size scaling of an observable @xmath28 of dimension @xmath29 is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a @xmath32 and @xmath2 independent finite - size scaling function : the whole disorder sample dependence is encoded inside the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "this is in fact an approximation since the scaling function has a residual @xmath2 dependence  @xcite .",
    "we next build dimensionless combinations of operators : we call them @xmath33 , and they are build in such a way to scale as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a @xmath36 , @xmath32 and @xmath2 independent finite size scaling function .",
    "a familiar looking combination is the single sample pseudo - binder cumulant @xmath37 ( notice that this is defined for a given disorder realisation ) : the genuine binder cumulant is defined as @xmath38 . for sensible choice of @xmath39",
    "the solution @xmath40 of the equation @xmath41 , with a disorder independent constant @xmath39 , is a proxy of the pseudo - critical temperature , namely @xmath42 with an @xmath32 and @xmath2 independent constant @xmath43 .",
    "for example for a function @xmath44 that in the infinite volume limit is zero in one phase and one in the other phase any constant @xmath39 in the interval @xmath45 $ ] will do : it is wise , in order to minimise the corrections to scaling to choose a legitimate value for @xmath39 such that @xmath40 is typically inside the critical region ( the value of @xmath40 depends on @xmath39 and on the choice made of a dimensionless combination @xmath46 ) .",
    "we are also able to use @xmath47 for determining @xmath3 : in this way we are able to monitor a quantity that diverges in the infinite volume limit , and to use it to extract a pseudo - critical temperature .",
    "the approach used to define @xmath3 in this case is based on the same technique : we compare the single sample spin glass susceptibility to a value close to the average spin glass susceptibility at the critical temperature on a given lattice size .",
    "this measurement is a good proxy for the direct measurement of the position of an emerging divergence .",
    "we have applied these ideas to the edwards - anderson model in @xmath21 and to the sk model .",
    "we used existing data obtained by the janus collaboration on systems with @xmath48 to @xmath49 for the @xmath21 ea model  @xcite , and from  @xcite for the sk model with @xmath20 ranging from @xmath50 up to @xmath51 . in both cases",

    "this procedure may seem dangerous , since we are extracting several transition temperatures from each of the @xmath33 , that are correlated variables .",

    "we have discussed in some detail about the features of the pseudo - critical , sample dependent temperatures in the mean field sk theory , and we have determined their scaling properties .",
    "the next step , that we present here , is in the study of their probability distribution .",

    "the two distributions turn out to be acceptable ( the gaussian hypothesis fits slightly better our data , but a tracy - widom hypothesis is certainly consistent as well ) . given the preliminary nature of this study , we shall restrict ourselves to the simplest determination of pseudo - critical temperatures , the one coming from the spin - glass susceptibility .",
