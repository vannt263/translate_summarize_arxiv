    "current cosmological measurements point to a _ flat _ universe whose mass - energy includes @xmath0 ordinary matter and @xmath1 non - baryonic dark matter , but is dominated by the _ dark energy _",
    "component , identified as the engine for the accelerated expansion  @xcite .",
    "the most economical description of the cosmological measurements attributes the dark energy to a cosmological constant ( cc ) in einstein s equations , representing an invariable vacuum energy density .",
    "the equation of state of the dark energy component @xmath2 in the cc case is constant and @xmath3 .",
    "however , from the quantum field approach , the bare prediction for the current vacuum energy density is @xmath4 orders of magnitude larger than the observed value .",
    "this situation is the so - called cc problem .",
    "in addition , there is no proposal which explains naturally why the matter and the vacuum energy densities give similar contributions to the universe s energy budget at this moment in the cosmic history .",
    "this is the so - called _ why now ? _",
    "problem , and a possible way to alleviate it is to assume a time varying , dynamical fluid .",
    "the quintessence option consists on a cosmic scalar field @xmath5 ( called _ quintessence _ itself ) which changes with time and varies across space , and it is slowly approaching its ground state . also , the quintessence equation of state is generally not constant through cosmic time  @xcite . in principle",
    ", the quintessence field may couple to the other fields . in practice , observations strongly constrain the couplings to ordinary matter  @xcite .",
    "however , interactions within the dark sectors , i.e. between dark matter and dark energy , are still allowed .",
    "this could change significantly the universe and the density perturbation evolution , the latter being seeds for structure formation . for models equivalent to the one studied here , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "+ in this paper we investigate how allowing for a feasible interacting dark matter and dark energy model will affect the cosmological constraints expected from future cmb experiments .",
    "the planck satellite mission , for example , is expected to provide high quality constraints on several key parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , those forecasts are usually performed under the assumption that the dark energy component is either a cosmological constant or a fluid with constant , redshift independent equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate if the assumption of a more elaborate dark energy component with a coupling with the dark matter could have an impact on these constraints .",
    "here we indeed focus on the future cmb data constraints on interacting dark matter - dark energy models , exploiting , in particular , the gravitational cmb lensing signal .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : seci ] presents the background and the linear perturbations of the interacting dark matter - dark energy model explored here .",
    "sections [ sec : secii ] and [ sec : seciii ] describe the cmb lensing extraction method and the future cmb data simulation used in our numerical analysis , respectively .",
    "we present our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : seciiii ] and draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : seciiiii ] .",
    "at the level of the background evolution equations , one can generally introduce a coupling between the dark matter and dark energy sectors as follows : @xmath7 where the bars denotes background quantities , @xmath8 refers to the dark matter ( dark energy ) energy density , the dot indicates derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the dark - energy equation of state ( @xmath11 denotes the pressure ) .",
    "we take @xmath12 as the background expansion rate .",
    "we work in the context of a friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , assuming a flat universe and pressureless dark matter @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 encodes the dark coupling and drives the background energy exchange between dark matter and dark energy . in order to deduce the evolution of the background as well as the density and velocity perturbations in coupled models , we need an expression for the energy transfer at the level of of the stress - energy tensor : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 refers to the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath18 is the energy - momentum transfer between the dark matter and dark energy fluids .",
    "we consider @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a dimensionless coupling ( considered constant , as well as @xmath2 , in the present analysis ) . @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 refer to the total expansion rate and dark energy density , background plus perturbation , _ i.e _ @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . in the previous eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eomm ] ) and  ( [ eq : eome ] ) , @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath25 , see our choice of coupling in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupl ] ) .",
    "notice from eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupl ] ) that @xmath26 has been chosen parallel to the dark matter four velocity @xmath27 , in order to avoid momentum transfer in the rest frame of the dark matter component  @xcite . for",
    "this choice of energy exchange @xmath26 , positive ( negative ) values of the coupling @xmath20 will lead to lower ( higher ) dark matter energy densities in the past than in the uncoupled @xmath28 case . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves here to negative couplings and @xmath29 , which avoids instability problems in the dark energy perturbation equations , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    the interacting model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupl ] ) has already been previously explored under several assumptions , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in those works",
    ", the linear perturbation analysis did not include perturbation of the expansion rate @xmath30 .",
    "let us mention that the former is included in the numerical analysis presented here .",
    "the latter is quite relevant for the correct treatment of gauge invariant perturbation but it does not affect much the physical results .",
    "details of the complete linear perturbation analysis will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite including the specification of the initial conditions which have been chosen adiabatic for all the components except for the dark energy fluid , see ref .  @xcite . for the numerical analysis presented here ,",
    "we have modified the publicly available camb code  @xcite , taking into account the presence of the dark coupling in both the background and the linear perturbation equations .",
    "the analysis presented here includes , in addition to the primary cmb anisotropy angular power spectrum , the information from cmb lensing .",
    "gravitational cmb lensing , as already shown ( see e.g. @xcite , can improve significantly the cmb constraints on several cosmological parameters , since it is strongly connected with the growth of perturbations and gravitational potentials at redshifts @xmath31 and therefore , it can break important degeneracies .",
    "the lensing deflection field @xmath32 can be related to the lensing potential @xmath5 as @xmath33  @xcite . in harmonic space",
    ", the deflection and lensing potential multipoles follows @xmath34 and therefore , the power spectra @xmath35 and @xmath36 are related through @xmath37    lensing introduces a correlation between different cmb multipoles ( that otherwise would be fully uncorrelated ) through the relation @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the @xmath41 modes and @xmath42 is a linear combination of the unlensed power spectra @xmath43 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "+ in order to obtain the deflection power spectrum from the observed @xmath44 , we have to invert eq .",
    "( [ eq : lens_corr ] ) , defining a quadratic estimator for the deflection field given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a normalization factor needed to construct an unbiased estimator ( @xmath47 must satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : defd ] ) ) .",
    "this estimator has a variance : @xmath48 that depends on the choice of the weighting factor @xmath49 and leads to a noise @xmath50 on the deflection power spectrum @xmath51 obtained through this method . in the next section",
    "we describe the method followed to extract the lensing noise .",
    "we evaluate the achievable constraints on the coupling parameter @xmath20 by a cosmomc analysis of future mock cmb datasets .",
    "the analysis method we adopt here is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc ` @xcite with a convergence diagnostic using the gelman and rubin statistics .",
    "we sample the following seven - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath54 , the scalar spectral index @xmath55 , the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath56 at @xmath57 mpc@xmath58 , the optical depth to reionization @xmath59 , and , finally , the coupling parameter @xmath20 . + we create full mock cmb datasets ( temperature , e  polarization mode and lensing deflection field ) with noise properties consistent with planck  @xcite and epic  @xcite experiments , see tab .

    "we can see that the cold dark matter density @xmath69 , the hubble constant @xmath70 , the cosmological constant @xmath71 , the sound horizon angle @xmath54 and the coupling @xmath20 are all strongly correlated and neither planck nor epic data will be able to break these degeneracies .",
    "notice as well that , despite the technological advances of epic , the error on the cosmological parameters achieved by the planck experiment will not be further improved by epic data if no lensing signal is considered .",
    "figures ( [ fig : degeneracyp ] ) and ( [ fig : degeneracycmb ] ) show the @xmath67 and @xmath68 confidence level contours combining the five most correlated parameters arising from a fit to planck and epic future data respectively , considering the information from cmb lensing .",
    "notice that the inclusion of lensing power spectrum improves drastically the epic constraints .",
    "however , the addition of cmb lensing information does not change planck results .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lensing noise for epic is significantly lower than for the planck experiment , and therefore epic data would be able to reject models that otherwise would be accepted by planck , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : lensnoise ] ) .",
    "the current accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by the so - called dark energy .",
    "this negative pressure component could be interpreted as the vacuum energy density , or as a cosmic , dynamical scalar field .",
    "if a cosmic quintessence field is present in nature , it may couple to the other fields in nature .",
    "while the couplings of the quintessence field to ordinary matter are severely constrained , an energy exchange among the dark matter and dark energy sectors is allowed by current observations .",
    "the major goals of the on - going planck and the future epic experiments are to determine the nature of the dark energy component and to measure the remaining cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision .",
    "several studies in the literature have been devoted to explore the performance of planck and epic experiments in the dark energy scenario , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we have explored the performance of planck and epic experiments in alternative dark energy cosmologies , more concretely , in a universe with a coupling @xmath20 among the dark energy and dark mater components  @xcite .",
    "we have generated mock data for the planck and epic experiments .",
    "cmb gravitational lensing extraction has also been included in the analysis .",
    "the lensing noise has been computed by means of the minimum variance estimator method of ref .",
    "the mock data have then been analyzed using mcmc techniques to compute the errors on the several cosmological parameters considered here .",
    "we find that relevant degeneracies are present among the coupling @xmath20 and some other cosmological parameters , as the cold dark matter density @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a coupling , the expected planck or epic errors on quantities as the cold dark matter energy density or the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath54 are one order of magnitude larger than in standard cosmologies with @xmath28 .",
    "when gravitational cmb lensing extraction is included in the analysis , planck results remain unchanged , due to the high level of lensing noise for this experiment .",
    "however , the epic mission , which will benefit from a much lower lensing noise level , can ( a ) provide tighter constraints on the cosmological parameters , even in the presence of a coupling , and ( b ) distinguish among coupled and uncoupled models that would look identical if they were fitted to planck ( lensed or unlensed ) data .",
