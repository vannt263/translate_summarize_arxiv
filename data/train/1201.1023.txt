    "transiting extrasolar planets allow the exciting possibility of studying the intrinsic physical properties of these planets .",
    "the last several years have seen rapid strides in this direction , with measurements of precise masses and radii , detection of numerous secondary eclipses and phase curves , and the start of ground - based optical spectroscopy @xcite .    though ground - based , near - infrared ( nir ) photometry of exoplanets is becoming commonplace , until recently there were no successful detections via ground - based nir spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "several groups have employed high - resolution spectrographs with some form of template cross - correlation @xcite with varying degrees of success .",
    "though cross - correlation provides a method to test for the detection of a particular model , it has the significant drawback that it does not provide a model - independent measurement .",
    "furthermore , such observations require high - resolution cryogenic spectrographs on large - aperture telescopes .",
    "the only published , model - independent , ground - based , nir spectrum of an exoplanetary atmosphere @xcite was obtained with a different approach : medium - resolution spectroscopy of hd  189733b with the 3  m nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) covering the k and l bands . however ,",

    "* ) , while the l band exhibits an extremely high flux peak attributed variously to non - lte  emission @xcite and to contamination by telluric water vapor @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the tentative spectroscopic detection of  we present in this paper reproduces previous , high s / n ground - based photometry @xcite and we demonstrate that our final result is not likely to be corrupted by telluric variations outside of well - defined spectral regions .",
    "the transiting hot jupiter  has an orbital period of 1.1  days around its 6300  k host star , and the planet s mass and radius give it a bulk density only 25% of jupiter @xcite .",
    "the planet is one of the largest known and is significantly overinflated compared to standard interior models @xcite .",
    "the planet is significantly distorted and may be undergoing roche lobe overflow @xcite , but tidal effects are not expected to be a significant energy source . though the initial report suggested had a nonzero eccentricity , subsequent orbital characterization via timing of secondary eclipses @xcite and further radial velocity measurements @xcite suggest an eccentricity consistent with zero .    is intensely irradiated by its host star , making the planet one of the hottest known and giving it a favorable ( @xmath6 ) nir planet / star flux contrast ratio ; it has quickly become one of the best - studied exoplanets .",
    "the planet s large size , low density , and high temperature have motivated an ensemble of optical , @xcite , nir @xcite , and mid - infrared @xcite eclipse photometry which suggests this planet has an unusual carbon to oxygen ( c / o ) ratio greater than one @xcite .",
    "however , a wide range of fiducial atmospheric models fit s photometric emission spectrum equally well despite differing significantly in atmospheric abundances and in their temperature - pressure profiles @xcite .",
    "many hot jupiters appear to have high - altitude temperature inversions @xcite , but even wasp-12b s precise , well - sampled photometric spectrum does not constrain the presence or absence of such an inversion .",
    "thus significant degeneracies remain ; this is a common state of affairs in the field at present even for such relatively well - characterized systems@xcite .",
    "this is because ( a ) broadband photometry averages over features caused by separate opacity sources and ( b ) atmospheric models have many more free parameters than there are observational constraints .",
    "spectroscopy , properly calibrated , can break some of these degeneracies , test the interpretation of photometric observations at higher resolution , and ultimately has the potential to more precisely refine estimates of atmospheric abundances , constrain planetary temperature structures , and provide deeper insight into high - temperature exoplanetary atmospheres .",

    "we are then better able to look for the eclipse signature as a differential effect while relying on the precise nir photometric eclipse depths @xcite to place our measurements on an absolute scale . however , even after removing the common - mode time series the eclipse signal is still masked by the photometric sawtooth , airmass dependencies , and general photometric noise .",

    "we fit each spectral time series ( i.e. , the flux in each wavelength bin ) with the following relation , representing an eclipse light curve affected by systematic and telluric effects : @xmath31 the symbols are : @xmath32 , the slit loss - corrected flux measured at timestep @xmath33 in wavelength bin @xmath34 ; @xmath35 , the total ( star plus planet day side ) flux that would be measured above the earth s atmosphere ; @xmath36 , the airmass , which is modulated by the coefficient @xmath37 , an airmass - like extinction coefficient in which the airmass is proportional to the log of observed flux ; @xmath38 , the flux in an eclipse light curve scaled to equal zero out of eclipse and -1 inside eclipse ; @xmath39 , a scale parameter equal to the relative depth of eclipse ; @xmath40 , the @xmath41 state vectors ( e.g. , nod position , @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) expected to have a small , linearly perturbative effect on the instrumental sensitivity ; and @xmath44 , the coefficients for each state vector . to account for and remove the effect of any slow drifts we also tried including low - order chebychev polynomials in orbital phase in the set of state vectors , but these did not improve our results .",

    "although including these two decorrelation vectors appears warranted on statistical grounds , our modeling efforts ( discussed in sec .",

    "the sdom provides a measure of the purely statistical variations present in the planetary spectra .    after summing the data into wavelength channels 25  nm wide ( to ease the computational burden ) we run both markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) and prayer bead ( or residual permutation ; *",
    "* ) analyses for each wavelength - binned time series .",
    "since mcmc requires an estimate of the measurement uncertainties , we follow our earlier approach of setting the uncertainties in each wavelength channel such that the resultant @xmath15 value equals unity .",
    "the residual permutation method fits multiple synthetic data sets constructed from the best - fit model and permutations of the residuals to that fit , and it is similar to bootstrapping but has the advantage of preserving correlated noise .    the posterior distributions of eclipse depth that result from the mcmc analysis are all much narrower than the uncertainties estimated from both the sdom and from the prayer bead analysis .",

    "our primary result is methodological : to avoid biases from chromatic slit losses single - slit , nir spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets should use slits as wide as possible and always keep the slit aligned to the parallactic angle .",
    "instruments must be kept well - focused throughout such observations to minimize the effects of seeing variations . substantially more attention",
    "must be paid to telluric variations if observations are to extend beyond the fairly narrow windows we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : telluric ] .",
    "we predict that multi - object spectrographs will easily achieve better performance than what we have demonstrated here : wider slits and multiple simultaneous calibration stars will measure and remove instrumental and telluric systematics .",
    "these instruments are deployed on an ever - growing number of large - aperture telescopes and are beginning to be put to the test . in the meantime , we hope our descriptions of these first stumbling efforts will inform future studies so that the routine , detailed characterization of exoatmospheres can begin in earnest .",

    "<S> our results show the promise and pitfalls of using single - slit spectrographs for characterization of extrasolar planet atmospheres , and we suggest future observing techniques and instruments which could lead to further progress . limiting systematic effects include the use of a too - narrow slit on one night  which observers could avoid in the future  and chromatic slit losses ( resulting from the variable size of the seeing disk ) and variations in telluric transparency  which observers can not control . </S>",
    "<S> single - slit observations of the type we present remain the best option for obtaining @xmath5 spectra of transiting exoplanets in the brightest systems . </S>",
    "<S> further and more precise spectroscopy is needed to better understand the atmospheric chemistry , structure , and energetics of this , and other , intensely irradiated planet . </S>"
