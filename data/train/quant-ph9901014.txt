    "the concept of nonclassical states of light has drawn much attention in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the customary definition of nonclassicality is given in terms of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-function : a nonclassical state does not admit a regular positive @xmath0-function representation , namely , it can not be written as a statistical mixture of coherent states .",
    "such states produce effects that have no classical analogue .",
    "these kinds of states are of fundamental relevance not only for the demonstration of the inadequacy of classical description , but also for applications , e.g. , in the realms of information transmission and interferometric measurements @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in testing the nonclassicality of a quantum state by means of an operational criterium , which is based on a set of quantities that can be measured experimentally with some given level of confidence , even in the presence of loss , noise , and less - than - unity quantum efficiency .",
    "the positivity of the @xmath0-function itself can not be adopted as a test , since there is no method available to measure it .",
    "the @xmath0-function is a fourier transform on the complex plane of the generating function for the normal - ordered moments ; hence , in principle , it could be recovered by measuring all the quadrature components of the field , and subsequently performing an ( deconvolved ) inverse radon transform @xcite . currently , there is a well - established quantitative method for such a universal homodyne measurement , and it is usually referred to as quantum homodyne tomography ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , as proven in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the generalized wigner functions of order @xmath1 can be measured , @xmath2 being the quantum efficiency of homodyne detection . hence , through this technique , all functions from @xmath3 to @xmath4 can not be recovered , i.e. , we can not obtain the @xmath0-function and all its smoothed convolutions up to the customary wigner function .",
    "for the same reason , the nonclassicality parameter proposed by lee @xcite , namely , the maximum @xmath5-parameter that provides a positive distribution , can not be experimentally measured .    among the many manifestations of nonclassical effects",
    ", one finds squeezing , antibunching , even - odd oscillations in the photon - number probability , and negativity of the wigner function  @xcite .",
    "any of these features alone , however , does not represent the univocal criterium we are looking for .",
    "neither squeezing nor antibunching provides a necessary condition for nonclassicality  @xcite .",
    "the negativity of the wigner function , which is well exhibited by the fock states and the schrdinger - cat - like states , is absent for the squeezed states .",
    "as for the oscillations in the photon - number probability , some even - odd oscillations can be simply obtained by using a statistical mixture of coherent states  @xcite .",
    "many authors  @xcite have adopted the nonpositivity of the phase - averaged @xmath0-function @xmath6 as the definition for a nonclassical state , since @xmath7 invalidates mandel s semiclassical formula  @xcite of photon counting , i.e. , it does not allow a classical description in terms of a stochastic intensity .",
    "of course , some states can exhibit a `` weak '' nonclassicality  @xcite , namely , a positive @xmath8 , but with a non - positive @xmath0-function ( a relevant example being a coherent state undergoing kerr - type self - phase modulation ) .",
    "however , from the point of view of the detection theory , such `` weak '' nonclassical states still admit a classical description in terms of having the intensity probability @xmath9 . for this reason ,",
    "we adopt nonpositivity of @xmath8 as the definition of nonclassicality .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have recognized relations between @xmath8 and generalized moments of the photon distribution , which , in turn , can be used to test the nonclassicality .",
    "the problem is reduced to an infinite set of inequalities that provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for nonclassicality  @xcite . in terms of the photon - number probability @xmath10 of the state with density matrix @xmath11 ,",
    "the simplest sufficient condition involves the following three - point relation for @xmath12  @xcite @xmath13 ^ 2<0 \\;.\\label{p2p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] higher - order sufficient conditions involve five- , seven- ,  , @xmath14-point relations , always for adjacent values of @xmath15 .",
    "it is sufficient that just one of these inequalities be satisfied in order to assure the negativity of @xmath8 .",
    "notice that for a coherent state @xmath16 identically for all @xmath15 .    in the following",
    "we show that quantum tomography can be used as a powerful tool for performing the nonclassicality test in eq .",
    "( [ p2p ] ) . for less - than - unity quantum efficiency ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "we rely on the concept of a `` noisy state '' @xmath18 , wherein the effect of quantum efficiency is ascribed to the quantum state itself rather than to the detector . in this model",
    ", the effect of quantum efficiency is treated in a schrdinger - like picture , with the state evolving from @xmath19 to @xmath18 , and with @xmath20 playing the role of a time parameter .",
    "such lossy evolution is described by the master equation @xmath21 wherein @xmath22 with @xmath23 .    for the nonclassicality test , reconstruction in terms of the noisy state",
    "has many advantages over the true - state reconstruction .",
    "in fact , for nonunit quantum efficiency @xmath17 the tomographic method introduces errors for @xmath12 which are increasingly large versus @xmath15 , with the additional limitation that quantum efficiency must be greater than the minimum value @xmath24 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the reconstruction of the noisy - state probabilities @xmath25 does not suffer such limitations , and even though all quantum features are certainly diminished in the noisy - state description , nevertheless the effect of nonunity quantum efficiency does not change the sign of the @xmath0-function , but only rescales it as follows : @xmath26 hence , the inequality ( [ p2p ] ) still represents a sufficient condition for nonclassicality when the original probabilities @xmath10 are replaced with the noisy - state probabilities @xmath27 , the latter being given by the bernoulli convolution @xmath28 hence , when referred to the noisy - state probabilities @xmath29 , the inequality in eq .",

    "( [ p2pm ] ) , the quantity @xmath31 is nonlinear in the density matrix .",
    "this means that @xmath31 can not be measured by averaging a suitable kernel function over the homodyne data , as for any other observable  @xcite .",
    "hence , in the evaluation of @xmath32 one needs to tomographically reconstruct the photon - number probabilities , using the kernel functions@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the parabolic cylinder function and @xmath35 .",
    "the true - state probabilities @xmath12 are obtained by averaging the kernel function in eq .",
    "( [ ker ] ) over the homodyne data . on the other hand ,",
    "the noisy - state probabilities @xmath36 are obtained by using the kernel function in eq .",
    "( [ ker ] ) for @xmath37 , namely without recovering the convolution effect of nonunit quantum efficiency .",
    "notice that the expression ( [ ker ] ) does not depend on the phase of the quadrature .",
    "hence , the knowledge of the phase of the local oscillator in the homodyne detector is not needed for the tomographic reconstruction , and it can be left fluctuating in a real experiment .    regarding the estimation of statistical errors ,",
    "they are generally obtained by dividing the set of homodyne data into blocks . however , in the present case , the nonlinear dependence on the photon number probability introduces a systematic error that is vanishingly small for increasingly larger sets of data .",
    "therefore , the estimated value of @xmath38 will be obtained from the full set of data , instead of averaging the mean value of the different statistical blocks .",

    "[ f : fig1][f : fig7 ] we present some numerical results that are obtained by a monte - carlo simulation of a quantum tomography experiment . the nonclassicality criterium is tested either on a schrdinger - cat state @xmath39 or on a squeezed state @xmath40 , wherein @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 denote a coherent state with amplitude @xmath44 , the displacement operator @xmath45 , and the squeezing operator @xmath46 , respectively .",

    "[ f : fig4][f : fig6 ] .",
    "let us compare the statistical errors that affect the two measurements , namely , those of @xmath38 and @xmath31 on the original and the noisy states , respectively .",
    "in the first case ( figs .",
    "[ f : fig1][f : fig3 ] ) the error increases with @xmath15 , whereas in the second ( figs .",

    "[ f : fig7 ] shows tomographically - obtained values of @xmath49 for the phase - squeezed state ( cf .",
    "[ f : fig5 ] ) , but for a lower quantum efficiency @xmath50 .",
    "notice that , in spite of the low quantum efficiency , the nonclassicality of such a state is still experimentally verifiable , as @xmath51 by more than five standard deviations .",
    "in contrast , for coherent states one obtains small statistical fluctuations around zero for all @xmath15 .",
    "= 0.6    = 0.6    = 0.6    we remark that the simpler test of checking for antibunching or oscillations in the photon - number probability in the case of the phase - squeezed state considered here ( figs .",

    "quantum homodyne tomography can also be employed to test the nonclassicality of two - mode states . for a two - mode state nonclassicality",

    "the theoretical value of @xmath66 for the state in eq .",

    "( [ twb ] ) is particularly facilitated by the self - homodyning scheme , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . with regard to the effect of quantum efficiency @xmath17",
    ", the same argument still holds as for the single - mode case : one can evaluate @xmath68 for the twin - beam state that has been degraded by the effect of loss . in this case , the theoretical value of @xmath69 is simply rescaled to @xmath70 .",
    "= 0.6    in fig .",
    "[ f : fig9 ] we report @xmath71 _ vs. _ @xmath72 , @xmath2 ranging from 1 to 0.3 in steps of 0.05 , for the twin - beam state in eq .",
    "( [ twb ] ) with @xmath73 , corresponding to the total average photon number equal to 2 .",

    "notice that the nonclassicality test in terms of the noisy state gives values of @xmath71 that are increasingly near the classically positive region for decreasing quantum efficiency @xmath2 .",

    "( [ twb ] ) up to @xmath80 .",
    "we have shown that quantum homodyne tomography allows one to perform nonclassicality tests for various single- and two - mode radiation states , even when the quantum efficiency of homodyne detection is rather low .",
    "the method involves reconstruction of the photon - number probability or of some suitable function of the number operators pertaining to the noisy state , namely , the state degraded by the less - than - unity quantum efficiency .",
    "the noisy - state reconstruction is affected by the statistical errors ; however , they are sufficiently small that the nonclassicality of the state can be tested even for low values of @xmath2 . for the cases considered in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the nonclassicality of the states can be proven ( deviation from classicality by many error bars ) with @xmath81@xmath82 homodyne data . moreover , since the knowledge of the phase of the local oscillator in the homodyne detector is not needed for the tomographic reconstruction , it can be left fluctuating in a real experiment .",
    "hence , we conclude that the proposed nonclassicality test should be easy to perform experimentally .",
