    "a compilation of source properties detected by different experiments can be found at the web resource tevcat . while in most cases",
    "the identification of the object responsible for vhe emission is possible thanks to a multiwavelength investigation of the region , at least 25 detections have no firm counterpart .",
    "from here onwards we will refer the latter as unidentified vhe sources ( unid ) .",
    "the molecular content is usually estimated through the intensity of the @xmath1co(1@xmath20 ) line at 115 ghz ( 2.6 mm , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , if the gas is diluted , this method is shown to fail @xcite .",
    "the gas that can not be traced with this method is usually referred to as _ `` dark '' _ gas , or _",

    "existence of such gas co - located with the unid tev sources may relax conditions on the accelerator power that is putatively injecting cosmic - rays , the interaction of which would generate the tev photons .",
    "vhe sources are also expected to be associated with regions of high stellar activity , that are generally regions with high material content and high emission from the dust component .",
    "then , in order to better trace the total material content of a region , dust emission and an hi content estimation should also be used . the hi content",
    "can be traced through the intensity of the 21 cm line due to the hyperfine transition at the ground level .",
    "dust emission can be traced through its thermal emission peaking at far infrared wavelenghts ( @xmath4 ghz ) . in the following",
    ", we will use all three methods to detail the environment on line - of - sight of unid sources .",
    "we frame this study in a larger scenario by analyzing with a similar method the compatiblity of results for gas content estimations along every line of sight in the galaxy .",
    "the procedure for the calculation of material content is explained in section [ sec : estimation ] . in section",
    "[ sec : define_and_gal ] we define the parameterization we use and explore the material content relations in the galactic plane . details of the selected unid sources and of the related material content are given in section [ sec : unid ] .",
    "control populations are explored in section [ sec : control ] and conclusions are given afterwards .",
    "the gas surface density at a given projected position in the sky can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the column density , @xmath7 is the mean weight per h atom , @xmath8 is the mass of the h nucleon .",
    "the dust content can be used as tracer of the total mass ( hydrogen in any form ) ; i.e. , eq .",
    "[ eq : mass ] is used to derive the total content @xmath9 , the surface brightness estimated from dust emission , once @xmath10 , column density of the hydrogen , is calculated from the thermal emission of dust ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dust emissivity at the reference frequency @xmath13 , which contains the knowledge on the emissivity of the dust grains and their composition , @xmath14 is the dust optical depth at frequency @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the dust spectral index .",
    "the _ pixel _ ( px ) refers to the unit division of the map that will be used to obtain the value of @xmath14 , in this case pixels of @xmath17 , see below .",

    "they were obtained by fitting the planck data at 353 , 545 and 857 ghz together with the iras ( iris ) 100 micron data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "one can use all - sky maps for @xmath21 to calculate the gas surface density . in the following we use the emission at @xmath22353 ghz .",
    "the all - sky maps released in the online archive refer to this frequency @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] we show the intensity map of @xmath23(353ghz ) from the planck legacy archive , for a cut of the galactic region ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "we choose here the planck maps with a higher signal to noise ratio , tagged as `` type2 '' in the archive @xcite . from @xmath25 one can estimate the amount of molecular material as follows : @xmath26 indeed , the definition of the conversion factor @xmath27 comes from the assumption that the content of co is proportional to the molecular content of the region @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the linearity of eq .",
    "[ eq : massco ] is assured for a large range of column densities .",
    "the linearity breaks down for region of very high or very low densities .",

    "_ pixel _ ( px ) refers to the unit division of the map in question , that was also binned to px=@xmath17 , as before .",
    "the last tracer used allows the estimation of the atomic component : the intensity of the 21 cm hi line .",
    "this quantity is provided by the leiden bonn argentine ( lab ) survey , which provides mapping of the intensity of the 21 cm hi line in cubes of galactic latitude , longitude , and radial velocity @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity in local standard of rest of the map would allow the estimation of distances after the assumption of a galactic rotation model .",
    "the information for the dust map is two - dimensional , giving the intensity of thermal emission for each location in the projected sky .",
    "therefore , in the following , we simply integrate the @xmath31 information along the line of sight .",
    "one can use the values from lab survey , convert the velocity - integrated intensity into @xmath32 and then use eq .",

    "the conversion factor in this case is @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , eq . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , valid in the optically thin approximation",
    ". however , the mass of the hi component can be underestimated if the optically thin approximation for the 21 cm line is no longer valid ( at large column densities ) .",
    "as described by @xcite , this can lead to the mass estimate to be off by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : maps ] shows the maps we use , for a cut of the galactic region ( @xmath24 ) , pixelized with our search radius at the different frequencies .",

    "the dust and @xmath25 maps have been repixelized to match the resolution of the lab survey maps ( 1px=0.5@xmath38 ) .",
    "this is slightly larger than the original pixelization of the all - sky map of optical depth ( 5 , * ? ? ?",
    "this extension was chosen to have a consistent pixelization in all maps , but also to have an extension comparable to a circle of @xmath39 in radius , that was chose as the discovery radius in the hgps @xcite .",
    "the emissivity of the dust ( @xmath12 ) is a difficult parameter to estimate , and depends on the type of dust considered and on the density of the region . a reliable calculation of the hydrogen column density from eq .",
    "[ eq : massdust ] would require the knowledge of @xmath12 tied to the value of the @xmath16 index , i.e. both @xmath6 and @xmath12 need to be derived with the same assumption on the @xmath16 index .",
    "if the dust emission sed is fit by leaving @xmath16 as a free parameter and the dust mass is derived assuming a dust cross section for a different value of @xmath16 , then the mass estimate can be wrong by a factor 2 - 3 . instead , if the sed is fit using correct combinations of @xmath16 and dust cross section , the estimated dust masses can vary by only 10 - 20% independently from the specific value of @xmath16 used @xcite .",
    "all the dust related quantites investigated here assume @xmath40 , so that our calculation of gas surface density is self consistent .",

    "a study of the impact of dust grain composition in a laboratory setting is given in @xcite , where values as high as @xmath48 are shown for the low temperature relevant for dust .",
    "this would correspond to @xmath49 @xmath44 h@xmath45 , with @xmath50 being the dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "this is a very extreme value , relevant for only one of the synthesised analogues of interstellar amorphous silicate grain samples , and we will not use it here . therefore ,",
    "parameterizing @xmath51 and considering the maximum value for the opacity as @xmath52 @xmath44 h@xmath45 , we obtain @xmath53 @xmath44 h@xmath45 for @xmath40 compatible with @xcite .",
    "similarly , considering as a lower value the ism estimate , this translate in a value of @xmath54 @xmath44 h@xmath45 .    regarding the molecular content tracer , we will consider the range @xmath55 \\times 10^{20 } \\textrm{cm}^{-2 } ( \\textrm{k km / s})^{-1}$ ] @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite cites values as low as @xmath56 only for particular regions in the central part of the galaxy",
    ". however , most of the unid sources that we want to study here are located at a galactocentric distance larger than 500 pc with the possible exception of source # 10 ( see table [ tbl : unid ] below ) .",
    "the recommended standard galactic value is @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "thus , to summarize we consider the following intervals : @xmath58    for ease of interpretation however , we will also refer to the average value of these parameters as : @xmath59",
    "requesting that different estimates trace the same total content @xmath60 one can define the quantity @xmath61 : @xmath62 that we will call dust - to - co ratio , where @xmath63 should be @xmath64 in the case that molecular material is dominant ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) .",
    "@xmath61 is defined as such from the ratio of the gas surface densities , but separating the observables ( dust emission and co line intensity ) from the conversion parameters .",
    "the values of the observables are derived from the tracer maps as detailed above .",
    "the range of possible values for the ratio @xmath61 is @xmath66 when considering the interval ranges for the dust emissivity and @xmath28 conversion factor derived in [ sub : macxcoconstants ] , see eq .",

    "thus the average value of the dust - to - co ratio parameter will be @xmath67 .",
    "extremes of this range of @xmath61 pinpoint mismatches in the mass estimations .",
    "when @xmath68 , there is an excess of dust emission with respect to what can be expected given the @xmath25 estimated at the same location . in other words , even using a larger dust emissivity , the estimate of gas surface density coming from dust will still exceed the estimate from @xmath25 . or , conversely",
    ", there is less @xmath25 than expected from the dust emission . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath69 , there is a stronger intensity @xmath25 than what can be expected given the dust emission at the same position .",
    "the @xmath30 traces best the molecular component , while @xmath9 traces all the material . assuming @xmath70 is equivalent to assume that the dust and the co line intensity can both trace the entire material content .",
    "it seems sensible to expect that the @xmath61 at each line of sight in the galaxy be contained in the band given by eq .",
    "[ eq : bandratio ] .",
    "we have calculated the value of @xmath61 in each pixel of the maps with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the values can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : unidratiosigma ] in red and green .",
    "the green points in fig .",
    "[ fig : unidratiosigma ] represent the values of @xmath61 for each line of sight in the galaxy with @xmath73 and red otherwise .",
    "we can think of the galactic longitude as a proxy for both galactocentric distance and column density in the galactic plane .",
    "it has been shown that the range of @xmath28 is actually due to an increase from a minimum value at small galactocentric distances @xcite . the v - shaped distribution seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : unidratiosigma ] might be a reflection of this @xmath28 behavior , with lower values of @xmath61 at small longitudes .",
    "the dust opacity @xmath74 has an opposite behavior , i.e. , it increases with column density ( naively forcing towards an inverted v - shape , with higher values of @xmath61 at small longitudes ) .",
    "however , if one were to exclude the very central region of the galaxy , there is no dominant trend of @xmath61 with galactic longitude , hence we do not try to refine the band depending on sky position .    we remind the meaning of @xmath61 limiting values : the upper border implies a high column density at large galactocentric distance ( it could happen in isolated clouds , but certainly it is not the common case ) ; the lower boundary is an even more unprobable case of a low column density at small galactocentric distance .",
    "the limiting values of @xmath61 should be regarded as conservative in the case of @xmath75 . nonetheless , many locations are outside the upper bounds defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : bandratio ] , so to render these bounds not valid outside the inner galactic plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : unidratiosigma ] ) .",
    "it is indeed to be noted also that most of the locations ouside the bounds have either large galactic longitude or latitude .",
    "this is especially interesting considering the fact such directions in the sky integrate less amount of material along the line of sight , hence the co - location of dust and molecular estimator should be clearer .",
    "this follows the fact that the dust profile from the galactic center falls less sharply than the intensity of the @xmath1co(1@xmath20 ) and this effect can not be mitigated even allowing for differences in conversion parameters .",
    "the assumption of @xmath75 is clearly failing for locations outside the band and indicates that the molecular content is not dominant and we need to consider a further gas component .",
    "we therefore consider in the following an obvious candidate for this : the atomic gas component traced through the intensity of the 21 cm hi line as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimation ] .",
    "we now define a new parameterization of the three gas surface densities , so to consider all tracers .",
    "this estimate does not depend on the common terms , that are @xmath46 and @xmath8 , so that is proportional to @xmath76 ( see eq .",
    "after simplification , the quantity to be evaluated is : @xmath77 and we will refer to it as dust estimation excess .",
    "we will now fix the dust opacity to @xmath54 @xmath44 h@xmath45 ( see eq . [ eq : limits ] ) , so to use this value as normalization . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiovsratio ] we show the distribution in longitude of the dust estimation excess derived from eq . [",
    "eq : threetracers ] .",
    "we here assume the conversion factor for the molecular component to be @xmath78 , as is the recommended standard galactic value in @xcite .",
    "we then fix the conversion factor for the atomic component to be @xmath79 , in the optically thin approximation . in this case",
    "one can see that , considering the atomic component , most of the unid source locations are inside an acceptable band of @xmath80 , defined as follows .",
    "the lower limit of this band is set to @xmath81 and corresponds to the minimum value of dust emissivity @xmath82 , while the upper limit of @xmath83 , correspond to @xmath84 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : limits ] ) .",
    "there are instances of @xmath85 .",
    "most cases are in central regions of the inner galaxy , where a @xmath86 can be expected ( see section [ sub : macxcoconstants ] ) .",
    "contrary to what is seen in the behaviour of @xmath61 , also the positions in the sky with large galactic longitude or latitude are inside the allowed bounds .",
    "there is therefore no necessity to invoke a further gas component once one allows for a change in the conversion factor normalization .",
    "we select all sources that have been tagged as `` unid '' or `` dark '' in the tevcat ( table [ tbl : unid ] ) .",
    "source # 23 and # 24 , might eventually relate to the same source .",
    "however , we stick to the catalog convention of considering them separate , as it is not excluded that the excess might be due to a composition of sources .",
    "we therefore select a sample of 24 sources .",

    "the cygnus region , for example , presents some of the largest values of @xmath80 .",
    "however this does not seem to be a viable explanation when considering that the average value for the conversion factor in the molecular component in the cygnus region , derived from fermi - lat data at high energies ( he ; e@xmath0100 mev ) , is @xmath93 @xcite . on the other hand , also",
    "the mass of the hi component can be underestimated if the optically thin approximation for the 21 cm line is no longer valid ( at large column densities ) .",
    "as described by @xcite , this can lead to the mass estimate to be off by a factor of @xmath36 .",

    "a large part of the detected galactic vhe sources is still classified as unidentified , due to the lack of suitable multiwavelength counterparts .",
    "we have investigated here the possibility that these unidentified sources are located in peculiar regions of the galaxy , where the classical estimates of the material content is not complete .",
    "we therefore analyzed the possible existence of _ `` co - faint '' _ gas in the location of tev unidentified sources .",
    "the presence of _ `` co - faint '' _ gas can be constrained with a combination of three tracers : intensity of the @xmath1co(1@xmath20 ) line to trace the molecular material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dust emission to trace the total hydrogen content ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hi hyperfine transition at 21 cm to trace for atomic hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are two main difficulties in these estimations . on one hand , the dust emission is projected in the sky , integrating along the line of sight . as also",
    "the distance of the unid sources is unknown , we would anyway not be able to use information on the distribution along the line of sight .",
    "on the other hand , every mass estimate relies on conversion factors that are usually derived with a cross - calibration of the classical tracers .",
    "in order to alleviate the influence of the conversion factor on our conclusions , we defined quantities that depend only on a combination of such parameters in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratiounsig ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : threetracers ] .",
    "we then explored the allowed parameter space of these quantities constraining it with the maximum / minimum values for the conversion factors given in the literature .",
    "we find for most of the unids , gps sources in the inner galaxy , or molecular cloud complexes , the mass estimate from the molecular component can be reconciled with the mass estimate from the dust component . in the majority of the cases",
    ", this requires a combination of a large emissivity parameter for the dust , @xmath110 , and a large @xmath28 factor .",
    "for very few unid sources , located in the outer galaxy and in particular in the cygnus region , a variation of conversion factors is not enough and there is the need to precisely consider also the atomic component .",
    "this is especially the case for the majority of the locations outside the inner galaxy ( see discussion in section [ sec : define_and_gal ] ) where the molecular component is clearly not dominant .",
    "we have however shown that no additional gas component is needed to reconcile mass estimation from the three different tracer , when the uncertainty of the conversion factor @xmath28 , @xmath79 and @xmath99 is considered .",
    "nonetheless , all possible gas components need to be taken into account when studying the expected contribution to the vhe emission .",
    "the precise knowledge of the conversion factor of a region is paramount for precise hadronic emission modeling of vhe source .",
    "a larger target mass would relax the requiment for the power of the source of accelerated particles for the same vhe flux .",
    "therefore we have searched here for the possibility of missing mass from the classical mass estimates in the special direction of vhe sources .",
    "it is however to be noted that here we can only assign upper limits on the mass target for vhe emission as the material content information are integrated along the line of sight .",
    "high material content and high dust emission is also expected in regions of high stellar activity , where known vhe emitter are probable to appear , like pwn , snr , binaries or regions of massive - star formation .",
    "the same reasoning would hold in an exploration of sources detected through fermi - lat data at he and without a sure counterpart @xcite . however , the source finding algorithm for fermi - lat relies on an assumption of the distribution and content of the surrounding gas in order to model the diffuse he component .",
    "the diffuse emission component model includes also a residual intensity map of unmodeled emission ( i.e. , galactic diffuse emission not traced by the gas and the inverse compton model from galprop ) .",
    "therefore any contribution in he from a possible additional untraced gas component would be included in the diffuse component and not in the source flux .",
    "we have used here coarse maps with a @xmath17 pixelization , being this the resolution of the lab hi survey .",
    "this was sufficient for the puropose of our study , as it is a similar angular size to the extension of the vhe sources investigated here .",
    "however , for a fine hadronic modeling of the vhe emission , a more detailed morphological mapping of the gas content would be required .",
    "the forthcoming gaskap survey of the hi content in the galactic plane will be extremely useful thanks to its superior sensitivity and especially angular resolution ( 30  , see * ? ? ?",
    "it will provide also distance information necessary for hadronic modeling .",
