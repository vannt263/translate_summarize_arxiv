    "the non - decoupling of the relevant scales on a wide and continuous range of magnitudes in many areas of physics has led to the invention ( discovery ) of the renormalisation group ( rg ) @xcite . whereas they have been discovered in the framework of the perturbative ( quantum field ) theory",
    ", the rg techniques tackle a nonperturbative physical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "nonperturbative approaches are difficult to implement and to control , and during a long time one has essentially carried on perturbative rg techniques ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . nowadays",
    ", the huge growth of the computing capacity has greatly modified this behaviour pattern and , already since the beginning of the ninety s , one has considered @xcite with a greater acuteness the exact rg equations ( erges ) originally introduced by wilson @xcite , wegner and houghton @xcite in the seventy s and slightly reformulated by polchinski @xcite in the eighty s ( for some reviews on the erges see @xcite ) .",
    "initially , the erges are integro - differential equations for the running action @xmath0 $ ] [ assuming that @xmath1 generically stands for some field with as many indices as necessary and @xmath2 the logarithm of a running momentum scale @xmath3 .",
    "they have been extended to the running ( average ) effective action @xmath4 $ ] @xcite .",
    "such general equations can not be studied without the recourse to approximations or truncations .",
    "one of the most promising approximations is a systematic expansion in powers of the derivative of the field ( derivative expansion ) @xcite which yields a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations the number of which grows quickly with the order of the expansion . in the simplest cases ( e.g. , for the scalar field ) , the determination of fixed points  ( and of their stability ) amounts to study ordinary differential equations ( odes ) with a two - point boundary value problem that may be carried out numerically via a shooting ( or a relaxation ) method .",
    "a pure numerical study is in general not easy to implement and to control .",
    "for example , in the shooting method , the discovery of the right adjustment of the parameters at the boundaries requires a good knowledge a priori of their orders of magnitude ( initial guesses ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to develop concurrently some substitute analytical methods .",
    "a popular substitute to the odes of the derivative expansion is provided by an additionnal expansion in powers of the field which yields a set of coupled algebraic equations which may be solved analytically , at least with the help of a symbolic computation software .",
    "various field expansions have been implemented with more or less success @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the methods proposed up to now , if they are easy to implement , do not work in all cases and especially in the most famous and simplest case of the wilson - polchinski erge @xcite ( equation for the running action @xmath0 $ ] with a smooth cutoff ) .",
    "the object of this paper is to present two new substitute analytical methods for studying odes which , at least in  the local potential approximation of the derivative expansion ( lpa ) , works for the wilson - polchinski erge .",
    "one of the methods , recently proposed in @xcite , is a genuine analytical approximation scheme to two - point boundary value problems of odes .",
    "the other method is new .",
    "it is based on approximations of the solution looked for by generalized hypergeometric functions .",
    "it has a certain similarity with another new and interesting method based on the representation of the solution by pad approximants just proposed in @xcite by p. amore and f. m. fernandez independantly from the present work .",
    "we illustrate the effectiveness of the two methods with the explicit consideration of two erges in the local potential approximation : the wilson - polchinski equation and the litim optimized rg equation @xcite for the running effective action ( named the litim equation in the following ) .  following",
    "a conjecture first stated in @xcite , the equivalence of these two equations ( in the lpa ) has been proven by morris @xcite and recently been numerically illustrated @xcite with an unprecedented accuracy for the scalar field in three dimensions ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this particular situation provides us with the opportunity of testing efficiently the various methods of study at hand .",
    "the following of the paper is divided in five sections . in section calculations ,",
    "we briefly present the direct numerical integration of the odes for the scalar model  using the shooting method : determinations of the fixed point and the critical exponents for both the wilson - polchinski and litim equations in the lpa ( distinguishing between the even and odd symmetries ) .",
    "a brief presentation of the currently used field expansion is given in section [ wpe ] .",
    "in section [ bfg ] , we analyse several aspects of the method of @xcite applying it to the study of the two equations .",
    "we calculate this way the fixed point locations with high precision and compare the results with the estimates obtained in section [ calculations ] .",
    "we show how the leading and the subleading critical exponents may be estimated using this recent method . in section [ ratios ]",
    "we present a new approximate analytical method for odes which is based on the definition of the generalized hypergeometric functions .",
    "we show that it is well adapted to treat the wilson - polchinski case whereas the litim case is less easily treated .",
    "we relate these effects to the convergence properties of the series in powers of the field .",
    "finally we summarize this work and conclude in section [ conc ] .",
    "in this section we briefly present the two - point boundary value problem to be solved in the lpa of the erge . the wilson - polchinski equation is first chosen as a paradigm in section [ wilpol ] .",

    "the reason is simple : none of the expansions currently used works in that case .",

    "we have considered explicitly those two methods applied to the study of the two equivalent odes .",
    "we have shown that they yield estimates as accurate as those obtained with the shooting method provided that the taylor series about the origin of the function looked for has a non - zero radius of convergence .",
    "this is an important new result since , up to now , no such approximate analytical method was known to work in the simplest case of the wilson - polchinski equation . in the case of the litim equation the two methods converge better than the currently used expansions ( usually referred to as i and ii in the literature , see e.g. [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "our results support concretely the conclusions of @xcite which indicated that the high field contributions were important in the wilson - polchinski case whereas they were less important in the litim case .",
    "the first of the two methods relies upon the construction of an auxiliary differential equation ( ade ) satisfied by the taylor series at the origin and to which is imposed the condition of the second boundary ( at infinity ) 6110 .",
    "the second method ( hfa ) is new .",
    "it consists in defining a global representation of the solution of the ode via a generalized hypergeometric function .",
    "the hfa method provides the advantage of yielding a global ( approximate ) representation of the solution via an explicit hypergeometric function .    in both cases it is possible to obtain easily ( with few terms in the field expansion ) rough estimates of the solution which may be used as guesses in a subsequent shooting method .",
    "the procedures may be applied to several coupled odes as shown in @xcite for the ade method .",
    "hence , we hope that the present work will  make easier and more efficient future explicit ( and ambitious ) considerations of the derivative expansion of exact renormalisation group equations .",
