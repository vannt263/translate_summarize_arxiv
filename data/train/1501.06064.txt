    "an important technique for investigating the structure of various types of materials is small - angle scattering ( sas )  @xcite which yields the differential elastic cross section per unit solid angle as a function of the momentum transfer .",
    "it is known that many disordered systems show the property of self - similarity across nano- and microscales  @xcite , such as various types of elastomeric membranes  @xcite , cements  @xcite , semiconductors  @xcite , magnetic  @xcite or biological structures  @xcite , and therefore the concept of fractal geometry  @xcite coupled with elements of sas technique can give new insights regarding the structural characteristics of such fractal systems  @xcite .",
    "one of the main parameters which can be obtained is the fractal dimension @xmath0  @xcite . for a mass fractal it is given by the scattering exponent of the power - law sas intensity @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "however , a number of experimental sas data shows a succession of power - laws whose scattering exponents take arbitrarily decreasing values  @xcite .",
    "such a behavior was not clearly understood until recently  @xcite , when it was shown that such type of successions corresponds to a fat fractal structure . in the later work ,",
    "the main structural characteristics have been obtained by calculating the mono- and polydisperse structure and form factor for a system consisting of fat cantor fractals ( known also as @xmath3-cantor sets  @xcite ) .",
    "although the fattened version of regular cantor set ( known also as thin cantor sets ) provides a simple and intuitive picture of the investigated properties , real physical systems have a more complex structure whose properties can be investigated by considering more complex structural models .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the fat cantor fractal model to fractal structures which can resemble more closely real physical systems and to show how we can extract information about the fractal dimensions at each level , total number of particles and about the most common distances in the fractal . to this end , we calculate the structure factor of fattened versions of vicsek  @xcite and menger sponge  @xcite , as they are often considered as structural models for various natural or artificial systems .",
    "an intuitive way to understand fat fractals is the following : we start with an initial cube ( here is used a cube , but any other shape could be used as well ; @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the fractal iteration number ) which is divided into 27 smaller cubes with side length @xmath6 from the initial cube . generally , in the first iteration ( @xmath7 ) some cubes ( out of the 27 smaller ones ) are kept and the others are removed . in particular , for the vicsek fractal we keep the eight cubes in the corners plus the middle one and remove all the others , while for the menger sponge we remove the smaller cubes in the middle of each face together with the cube in the center of the larger cube , and keep all the others .",
    "we repeat the same operation on each of the remaining cubes ( 9 for vicsek , and respectively 20 for menger ) , thus leaving 81 cubes , and respectively 400 cubes , of side length @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and so on . therefore ,",
    "at the @xmath5-th iteration the side length of the remaining cubes is @xmath10 .",
    "the number of remaining cubes then is given by @xmath11 the thin version of these fractals is obtained in the limit @xmath12 , and have the same fractal dimensions @xmath13 ( for vicsek ) and respectively @xmath14 ( for menger ) , independent on the iteration number . in this paper , the `` fattened '' version of these thin fractals is obtained by keeping the cubes instead of side length @xmath6 ( for @xmath15 ) , then @xmath8 ( for @xmath16 ) , then @xmath17 ( for @xmath18 ) , etc .",
    "the resulting fractal is topologically equivalent to the thin version , but the holes decrease in size sufficiently fast so that , when @xmath12 , the fractal has nonzero and finite volume , and fractal dimension 3 . here ,",
    "in the construction process we consider the same rules as already described in  @xcite : the side length of the initial cube is @xmath19 ( called zero - order iteration or initiator ) and specify it in cartesian coordinates as a set of points satisfying the conditions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 . the origin lies in the cube center , and the axes are parallel to the cube edges .",
    "the iteration rule ( _ generator _ ) is to replace the initial cube by cubes of edge @xmath23 ( @xmath7 ; whenever the quantity @xmath24 appears in the exponent , it is to be interpreted as an index and not a power ) . for the vicsek fractal",
    "the position of one cube is at the origin and the center of the eight cubes are shifted from the origin by the vectors @xmath25 with all the combinations of the signs , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a dimensionless positive parameter for the first iteration , obeying the condition @xmath28 , in order to avoid overlapping of the cubes . for the menger sponge the position of the eight cubes are shifted from the origin by the vectors @xmath25 and the positions of the 12 cubes are shifted by the vectors @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 with all the combinations of the signs .",
    "the second and third iterations ( @xmath32 ) are obtained by performing an analogous operation to each cube of the first iteration and with the same scaling factor @xmath27 .",
    "for each subsequent iterations we repeat the same operation but for @xmath33 and @xmath34 we take the scaling factor @xmath35 , for @xmath36 and @xmath37 we take the scaling factor @xmath38 and so on . if one consider that the edge of the removed parallelepiped at iteration @xmath5 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and the exponent @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , then @xmath44 , the side length of each cube by @xmath45 and the components of the @xmath46 vectors are given by @xmath47 . here , we consider @xmath48 in order to avoid superposition of cubes at least up to @xmath34 .    from their",
    "construction one can see that the fat fractals are built from a succession of exact self - similar fractals having different scaling factors at different scales .",
    "since the scaling factor depends on the iteration , each scale will have a different fractal dimension given by  @xcite @xmath49 , and each of this scale gives a power - law decay of structure factor @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "for structures corresponding to a generalized vicsek fractal  @xcite and menger sponge , the generative function , which gives the positions of the centers of scattering cubes at each iteration , reads as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then , the structure factor is obtained ( figs .",
    "( [ fig : fig1 ] ) and  ( [ fig : fig2 ] ) ) from  @xcite @xmath58 the position of minima are obtained when the cubes inside the fractal interfere out of phase , and therefore using @xmath59 , for @xmath60 we obtain ( vertical lines in fig .",
