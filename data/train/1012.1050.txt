    "in the last few years , braneworld inflation@xcite became a central paradigm of cosmology . in this context , _ randall - sundrum _ type @xmath3 model@xcite has attracted a lot of interests . to describe early inflation and recent acceleration of the universe ,",
    "various braneworld cosmological models have been proposed@xcite and deeply studiedbscz .",
    "recently , a new chaplygin gas model@xcite was introduced to describe dark matter and dark energy recently discovered@xcite .",
    "chaplygin gas model is a particular kind of matter , characterized by an exotic equation of state and was applied to study various cosmological models , such as chaotic canonical scalar field inflation@xcite and exponential tachyonic inflation on the brane@xcite .",
    "more recently , a generalized version of the original chaplygin gas model has been proposed and studied in the context of late time acceleration of the uuniversegcg and in the context of braneworld model@xcite .",
    "note that chaplygin gas has also recently been used to describe early inflationary universe@xcite . in the chaplygin gas inspired inflation model ,",
    "the scalar field is usually the standard inflaton field , where the energy density can be extrapolated to obtain a successful inflationary period with a chaplygin gas model@xcite .",
    "the motivation for introducing chaplygin gas braneworld models is the increasing interest in studing dark matter and dark energy in higher - dimensional cosmological models .",
    "we signal in this context , that chaplygin gas model is considered now as a viable alternative model that can provide an accelerated expansion of the early universe .",
    "the chaplygin gas emerges as an effective fluid of a generalized d - brane in space time , where the action can be written as a generalized born - infeld action@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to quantify the modifications of the chaplygin gas inspired inflation in the braneworld scenario .",
    "recall that the generalized chaplygin gas is defined by an exotic equation of state of the formbento@xmath4where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the energy density and pressure of the generalized chaplygin gas , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 is a constant satisfaying @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a positive constant . fom the matter conservation equation ,",
    "one can obtain the following generalized chaplygin gas energy density expression @xmath10 ^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}},\\]]where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the present day values of the scale factor and the generalized chaplygin gas energy density , respectively .",
    "note that the original chaplygin gas model corresponds to @xmath13 . in this case ,",
    "its was shown that the generalized chaplygin gas model can describe late time acceleration of the universe either for small values of the parameter @xmath7 or for very large ones@xcite . in order to describe early inflationary universe",
    ", we can use the following extrapolation@xcite@xmath14 ^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}\\longrightarrow \\rho _ { ch}=\\left [ a+\\rho _ { \\phi } ^{\\left ( \\alpha + 1\\right ) } \\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}.\\]]in this work , we first start in section @xmath3 , by recalling the foundations of chaplygin gas braneworld inflation and in particular , the modified _ friedmann _",
    "equation and various perturbation spectrum parameters are given .",
    "in the section @xmath15 we present our results for an exponential potential , and show that for some values of the number of e - folding @xmath0 , the inflation parameters are in good agreement with recent wmap7 data .",
    "the conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "we start this section by recalling briefly some fundations of _ randall - sundrum _ type @xmath3 braneworld model . in this scenario ,",
    "our universe is considered as a @xmath16-brane embedded in @xmath17-dimensional anti - de sitter space - time ( @xmath18 ) where gravitation can propagate through a supplementary dimension .",
    "one of the most relevant consequences of this model is the modification of the _ friedmann _ equation for energy density of the order of the brane tension or higher . in the case",
    "where the matter in the brane is domintad by the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) , the gravitationnal _ einstein _",
    "equations lead to the modified _",
    "equation on the brane @xcite:@xmath19where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the scalar field potential responsible of inflation , @xmath22 is the brane tension and @xmath23 is the _",
    "planck _ mass .",
    "one has also a second inflationary relation given by the _ klein - gordon _ eq .",
    "governing the dynamic of the scalar field @xmath24@xmath25where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28    in the following , we will consider the case where @xmath29 during inflation , the energy density associated to the scalar field is comparable to the scalar potential , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "here we shall introduce the well known slow - roll conditions , i.e. @xmath31 @xmath21 and @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "note that , perturbations on the brane are , generally , coupled to the bulk metric perturbations .",
    "this make the situation more complicated .",
    "however , on large scales on the brane , the density perturbations decouple from the bulk metric perturbations and the extreme slow - roll limit ( de sitter ) become applicable for rs - type ii model@xcite . in this case , the _ friedmann _",
    "equation reduces to@xmath34 in the some context , one can also consider the slow - roll parameters to study the spectrum of the perturbation@xcite .",
    "the two first parameters are given for gcg model by@xmath35where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that during inflation , the conditions@xmath38 and @xmath39 are satisfied .    on the other hand , one can derive the number of e - folding as @xmath40where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the values of the potentials at the horizon exit and the end of inflation , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of the inflationary perturbations is produced by quantum fluctuations of the scalar field around its homogeneous background values .",
    "thus , the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations @xmath43 is given in the slow - roll approximation by the following expression@xcite@xmath44note that , the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations @xmath43 allows us to define the scalar spectral index @xmath45 aslyth @xmath46another important inflationary spectrum parameter is the amplitude of the tensorial perturbations @xmath47 describing the primordial gravitational wave perturbations produced by a period of extreme slow - roll inflation , which is defined by@xcite@xmath48where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "note that in the high - energy limit ( @xmath51 ) , we have @xmath52 and in the low - energy limit ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 therefore , we recover the standard 4d results at the low - energy limit as expected .",
    "the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations and the running of the scalar index are presented respectively by@xmath55here , @xmath56 correspond to the case @xmath57 ; the value when the universe scale crosses the _",
    "hubble _ horizon during inflation@xmath58 in the next section , we consider an exponential potential to evaluate all the previous spectrum parameters describing branewold inflation .",
    "the exponential potential was studied in various occasions , for example the authors of ref.@xcite have shown that inflation becomes possible in braneworld model for a class of potentials ordinarily too steep to support inflation .",
    "this type of potential was also used for tachyonic inflation on the brane@xcite and recently for tachyonic chaplygin gas inflation on the brane@xcite . here",
    "we consider an exponential potential of the form @xmath59where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are constant .    in the present case",
    ", we apply this potential to derive and study the behaviour of various spectrum paramaters in the braneworl chaplygin gas scenario . in the high - energy limit ; i.e. @xmath62 all the inflationary parameters will be simplified . in this case , the slow - roll parameters eqs.(7,8 ) become @xmath63this give new expressions for the scalar spectral index@xmath64and for the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations@xmath65on the other hand , the running of the scalar index for chaplygin gas model becomes @xmath66finally , from eq.(9 ) , one can deduce the following expression for the e - folding number in the high energy limit @xmath67by combining eqs.(20 ) and ( 21 ) , we obtain @xmath68the last equation shows that @xmath69 , then inflation can end at @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the eq.(26 ) implies that @xmath71we see then that , the parameter a can be expressed in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath72 notice as well , that since @xmath73 then @xmath74 .",
    "inserting theexpression of @xmath9 ( eq.(27 ) ) in eq.(21 ) , we obtain@xmath75according to eq.(25 ) , we find@xmath76where   @xmath77we signal that , in the limit where @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath79consequently , we can find all the inflationary parameters in terms of @xmath41 using eqs.(28,29)@xmath80the equation ( 33 ) shows that the scalar spectral index @xmath45 depends only on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the limit where @xmath78 , we get@xmath81this result was first pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath82 we have @xmath83 whereas for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and for @xmath86 @xmath87 these values are outside the range given by wmap7 observation@xcite , since@xmath88thus , generally the e - folding number must be very large .    on the other hand , in the chaplygin gas model , we have also derived the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations , which is given by@xmath89similarly , in the limit where @xmath78 , @xmath90 becomes@xmath91as for @xmath45 , we recover here the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the eq.(37 ) denotes that the number of e - folding @xmath0 must satisfy the inequality @xmath92 in order for @xmath90 to be consistent with wmap7 since@xcite@xmath93 in the original chaplygin exponential braneworld inflation model ( @xmath94 , the running of the scalar index is@xmath95similarly to the previous case , in the limit where @xmath78 , we get@xmath96this equation shows that the running of the scalar index is small and negative for any value of e - folding number @xmath97 which correspond to sufficient inflation .    to confront simutaniously the observables @xmath45 , @xmath90 and @xmath98 with observations",

    "we observe that a large domain of variations of @xmath90 is consistent with wmap7 data .",
    "we note also that , the scalar spectral index values are in good agreement with the observations for large @xmath0 .",

    ", we show that @xmath2 is a decreasing function according to @xmath90 .",
    "we observe in this case that , for any values of @xmath100 allowed by the observations ( eq.38 ) , the running of the scalar index @xmath2 is small and negative .",
    "this result allows us to consider a negligible running which justifies our choice of observable values for the inflationary parameters .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a chaplygin gas model in the framework of braneworld inflation using an exponential potential .",
    "we have adopted here the slow roll approximation in the high - energy limit to derive all inflationary spectrum perturbation parameters in the particular case where @xmath29 see eq.(1 ) . in this way",
    ", we have shown that the inflationary parameters depend only on the e - folding number @xmath0 and the final value of the slow roll parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we have also shown that , for small and negligible running of the scalar spectral index @xmath2 , the inflationary parameters are in good agreement with wmap7 data .",
    "on the other hand , we have analyzed the limit @xmath101 where the parameters of inflation depend only on @xmath0 and the compatibility with the observations remains conditioned by the values of the number of e - folding @xmath0 .",
