    "this note reports the tevatron average top - quark mass obtained by combining the most precise published and preliminary measurements of the top - quark mass , @xmath3 .",
    "the experiments cdf and d , taking data at the tevatron proton - antiproton collider located at the fermi national accelerator laboratory , have made several direct experimental measurements of the top - quark mass , @xmath3 .",
    "the pioneering measurements were based on about @xmath4 of  data  [ 1 - 12 ] collected from 1992 to 1996 , and included results from the @xmath5  ( allh ) , @xmath6  ( l+jt ) or @xmath7 .",
    "decay channels with explicit tau lepton identification are presently under study and are not yet used for measurements of the top - quark mass .",
    "decays with @xmath8 are included in the direct @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels .",
    "] , and @xmath11  ( di - l ) decay channels .",
    "several additional measurements have been performed in  ( 2001 - present ) in all decay modes .",
    "the  measurements considered here are the most recent results in the l+jt , di - l , and allh channels using @xmath12 of data  @xcite except for the cdf analysis using charged particle tracking that has not been updated and uses luminosity of 1.9  @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a new analysis requiring missing transverse energy ( @xmath1 ) plus jets was added by cdf  @xcite .",
    "this sample is statistically independent from the other channels and is accounted as a forth channel ( called @xmath1+jets or met ) .    with respect to the july 2010 combination@xcite",
    ", the  cdf measurement in the all - hadronic channel has been updated using 5.8fb@xmath14 of data and improved analysis technique@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1+jets channel was added by cdf with 5.7fb@xmath14 of data .",
    "the now published  cdf measurements in the di - l channel@xcite and l+jt channel@xcite are unchanged .",
    "the measurement based on charged particle tracking  @xcite has been split into the decay length significance @xmath15 and lepton transverse momentum @xmath16 parts and the latter was removed from the combination because of a statistical correlation with other samples .",
    "the d   measurements presented in this note include the most recent run ii measurement in the di - l  @xcite channel using 5.4 fb@xmath14 of data and the updated one in the l+jt channel @xcite with 3.6 fb@xmath14 of data .",
    "both results are accepted for publication .",
    "the tevatron average top - quark mass is thus obtained by combining five published  measurements  @xcite with three published  cdf results  @xcite , two preliminary  cdf results  @xcite and two published  d  results  @xcite .",
    "the combination takes into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations using the method of refs .",
    "@xcite and supersedes previous combinations  .    the definition and evaluation of the systematic uncertainties and the understanding of the correlations among channels , experiments , and tevatron runs , is the outcome of many years of joint work between the cdf and d  collaborations .",
    "the input measurements and uncertainty categories used in the combination are detailed in sections  [ sec : inputs ] and  [ sec : uncertainty ] , respectively .",
    "the correlations used in the combination are discussed in section  [ sec : corltns ] and the resulting tevatron average top - quark mass is given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a summary and outlook are presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "for this combination twelve measurements of @xmath3  are used : five published  results , five published  results , and two preliminary  results , all reported in table  [ tab : inputs ] . in general , the  measurements all have relatively large statistical uncertainties and their systematic uncertainties are dominated by the total jet energy scale ( jes ) uncertainty . in both cdf and d",
    "take advantage of the larger @xmath17  samples available and employ new analysis techniques to reduce both these uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the  d  analysis in the l+jt channel and the  cdf analyses in the l+jt , allh and met channels constrain the response of light - quark jets using the kinematic information from @xmath18 decays ( _ in situ _ calibration ) .",
    "residual jes uncertainties associated with @xmath19 and @xmath20 dependencies as well as uncertainties specific to the response of @xmath21-jets are treated separately .",
    "the  cdf and d  di - l measurements and the cdf measurement based on charged particle tracking  @xcite use a jes determined from external calibration samples .",
    "some parts of the associated uncertainty are correlated with the  jes uncertainty as noted below .",
    ".summary of the measurements used to determine the tevatron average @xmath22 .",
    "integrated luminosity ( @xmath23 ) has units in @xmath24 , and all other numbers are in @xmath25 .",
    "the uncertainty categories and their correlations are described in the sec.[sec : uncertainty ] .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty and the total uncertainty are obtained by adding the relevant contributions in quadrature .",
    "`` n / a '' stands for `` not applicable , ' ' n / e `` for ' ' not evaluated \" . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : three_observables ]    we performed a cross - check changing all non - diagonal correlation coefficients from 100% to 50% and re - started the combination procedure .",
    "the result from this extreme check is @xmath26 shift of the top mass with negligible decreasing of the total error .",
    "we computed the combination of the  measurements only which gives : @xmath27 with @xmath28 and the combination of only the  measurements : @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "we also performed the separated combinations of all the cdf measurements and all the d  ones yielding to : @xmath31 for cdf and @xmath32 for d .",
    "taking all correlations into account , we calculate the chi - square @xmath33 corresponding to a probability of 11% .",
    "a preliminary combination of measurements of the mass of the top quark from the tevatron experiments cdf and d  is presented .",
    "the combination includes five published  measurements , five published  measurements , and two preliminary  measurements . taking into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations ,",
    "the preliminary result for the tevatron average is : @xmath34 , where the total uncertainty is obtained assuming gaussian systematic uncertainties . adding in quadrature the statistical and systematic uncertainties yields a total uncertainty of @xmath35 , corresponding to a relative precision of 0.54% on the top - quark mass . rounding off the uncertainty to two significant digits , the combination provides @xmath2 .",
    "the central value is 0.12gev/@xmath36 lover than our july 2010 average of @xmath37gev/@xmath36 , while the relative precision has improved by 12% with respect to the previous tevatron average .",
    "the mass of the top quark is now known with a relative precision of 0.54% , limited by the systematic uncertainties , which are dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty .",
    "this source of systematic uncertainty is expected to improve as larger datasets are collected since analysis techniques constrain the jet energy scale using kinematical information from @xmath18 decays . with the full",
    "dataset the top - quark mass will be known to an accuracy better than the one presented in this paper . to reach",
    "this level of precision further work will focus on a better understanding of @xmath21-jet modeling , and in the uncertainties in the signal and background simulations . for first time",
    "the total uncertainty of the combination is below 1   gev . with the current level of precision , the exact renormalization scheme definition corresponding to the current top mass measurements",
    "should be studied theoretically in more details .",
