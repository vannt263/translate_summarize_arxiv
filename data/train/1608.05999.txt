    "we would like to highlight two main topics in dynamical systems : the @xmath2 closing lemma and the search of reduced dynamical models that encapsulates the main properties of an open class of systems .",
    "the first one was posed by poincar and refers to the problem of finding periodic orbits nearby recurrent points either for a system or a @xmath3perturbation .",
    "it was solved in @xcite for the @xmath4 category . in higher topology",
    "it remains widely open except for certain particular classes of maps : rational maps of the riemann sphere  @xcite , one - dimensional real endomorphisms  @xcite , and recently hamiltonian surface diffeomorphisms  @xcite .",
    "for general surfaces diffeomorphisms , it remains completely open .",
    "the second topic is present in the whole theory of dynamics and consists in looking for simplified models that could extract the main features of systems .",
    "that approach goes from finding discrete topological representations using symbolic dynamics , first return maps for continuous dynamical systems and reducing the dimension of the space .",
    "related to that problem , poincar realized that flows may be reduced to discrete systems using one - codimensional sections .",
    "for instance , the hnon type map @xmath5 appears naturally as the first return map of some three - dimensional flows . in case",
    "when the flow is dissipative , the corresponding invertible system is area contracting , which heuristically means that the essential dynamics is confined to a one - dimensional subspace ; so the initial dynamic may share some essential features of the dynamics of the interval map @xmath6 in practice , the two - dimensional systems are much more difficult to describe : much less is known for the hnon map than for the quadratic family .",
    "moreover , many features that are not detected by the one - dimensional reduction have no one - dimensional counterpart : for instance there exists a residual set of hnon maps exhibiting infinitely many periodic attractors with unbounded period ( newhouse phenomenon ) , but generic smooth one - dimensional maps have an upper bound on the period of the attracting periodic points .    here ,",
    "we introduce a new class of dissipative surface diffeomorphisms that we call _ strong dissipative diffeomorphisms _ that captures certain properties of one dimensional map but keeps two - dimensional features showing all the well known complexity of dissipative surface diffeomorphisms .",
    "the dynamics of the new class , in some sense , is intermediate between one - dimensional dynamics and general surface diffeomorphism .",
    "moreover , under some hypothesis on the relation of the jacobian with the @xmath7norm and the oscillation of the jacobian in the attractor , it is proved that the strong dissipativeness is an open property ( see theorem [ p.strong ] ) and it is satisfied by diffeomorphisms close to one dimensional endomorphisms , proving in particular , that the new class is also non empty ( see theorem [ t.1d - bis ] ) .",
    "the class of strongly dissipative surface diffeomorphism may be compared to the class of moderately dissipative complex hnon maps considered in  @xcite : using different tools , an upper bound on the jacobian is used in order to control stable manifolds .",
    "the theory of real one - dimensional dynamic is leveraged on the order structure of the interval , a feature that does not exist for the plane .",
    "however , under dissipativeness , almost every point of any ergodic measure has a stable manifold that could help `` to order the trajectories '' ; in fact , the strong dissipative hypothesis , which is nothing else than assuming that the stable manifolds separate an attracting domain ( see definition [ sd defi ] ) , helps to recover in the particular case of the disk a partial order and to induce a rich one - dimensional structure . using that simple observation ,",
    "the dynamic can be reduced to a continuous non - invertible map acting on an ordered one - dimensional path connected metric space ( see theorem [ reduction ] ) .",
    "one can hope that this result could lead to obtain many others that hold for one - dimensional systems .",
    "note that for general surface homeomorphism , another reduction has been developed by le calvez  @xcite : it provides a foliation transverse to the dynamics on the complement to maximal sets of fixed points ; in this case the foliation is in general not invariant and the leaves are not proper .",
    "a clear result that highlights the richness of the strong dissipative class , is our last theorem ( see theorem [ t.measure revisited ] ) that shows that the periodic points are dense in the support of any invariant measure ( in particular , for the hnon type maps , see corollary [ c.henon ] ) ; in that sense , we get a @xmath2 closing lemma ( without perturbing ) for invariant measures .",
    "this was proved in @xcite for hyperbolic measures , however that result does not apply to measures that has a zero lyapunov exponent , which is the case for instance , of surfaces diffeomorphisms with zero entropy and in particular the ones in the boundary of chaos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an strong application of that result is obtainded in  @xcite where it is studied the structure of periodic point for strong dissipative diffeomorphisms of the disk . in short , in the last theorem , we conclude that for strongly dissipative diffeomorphisms of the disk , the closure of all periodic points contains the closure of the union of the supports of all invariant probability measures . to conclude a general clossing lemma ,",
    "it would be needed to prove that generically the recurrent set is contained in that set .",
    "let us consider a boundaryless surface @xmath8 and a @xmath9-diffeomorphism @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . if @xmath12 is _ dissipative _ , i.e. if @xmath13 for any @xmath14 , then any @xmath12-invariant ergodic probability measure @xmath15 which is not supported on a hyperbolic sink has one negative lyapunov exponent and another one which is non - negative .",
    "in particular for @xmath15-almost every point @xmath16 , there exists a well - defined one - dimensional stable manifold @xmath17 .",
    "we introduce a class of surface diffeomorphisms which strengthen the notion of dissipation :    [ sd defi ] a @xmath18-diffeomorphism @xmath10 is _ strongly dissipative _",
    "if    * @xmath19 is contained in a compact subset of @xmath8 , * @xmath12 is dissipative , * for any ergodic measure @xmath15 which is not supported on a hyperbolic sink , and for @xmath15-almost every point @xmath16 , the connected components of @xmath20 are not contained in @xmath19 .",
    "we denote @xmath21 , @xmath11 , the set of strongly dissipative @xmath18-diffeomorphisms .",
    "when the jacobian is almost constant , then the strong dissipation is an @xmath4-open property :    [ p.strong ] for any @xmath22 and any @xmath23 , consider @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25    then , any diffeomorphism @xmath26 that is @xmath27-close to @xmath12 is strongly dissipative .",
    "this result is based on a kind of continuity of pesin s blocks and uniformity of stable manifolds , which will be stated and proved in section  [ ss.stable ] .",
    "it uses that for non periodic ergodic measures , the negative lyapunov exponent is close to ( the logarithm of ) the minimum contraction of @xmath12 .",
    "this property is reminiscent of the works on the non - uniform hyperbolicity of some hnon maps  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the strong dissipation is satisfied by dynamics close to one - dimensional endomorphisms .",
    "that result is stated in its full generality in subsection  [ t.1d proof ] but to motivate it , let us present now how it applies to the hnon map :    [ t.1d - bis ] for any @xmath28 and for @xmath29 small , the hnon map @xmath30 is strongly dissipative on the surface @xmath31 .",
    "the following shows that , conversely to the previous theorem , strongly dissipative diffeomorphisms ( in particular hnon maps with @xmath32 small ) have a one - dimensional structure .",
    "this somewhat generalizes williams construction  @xcite of branched manifolds associated to hyperbolic surface attractors : in that case , the reduction obtained through the quotient of the stable manifolds gives an endomorphism on a branched one - dimensional manifold . for strongly dissipative theorem , even lacking a uniformly stable foliation , using the strong dissipation , a reduced one - dimensional dynamics is obtained as a continuous non - invertible map acting on a real tree .",
    "we recall that a real tree is a path connected metric space such that for any two points @xmath33 there exists a unique subset homeomorphic to @xmath34 $ ] whose endpoints are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "[ reduction ] let @xmath37 , @xmath11 , be a strongly dissipative diffeomorphism of the disc @xmath38 .",
    "then there exists a semi - conjugacy @xmath39 to a continuous map @xmath40 on a compact real tree which induces an injective map on the set of non - atomic ergodic measures of @xmath12 .    as an application of the notion of strong dissipation ,",
    "we show that the periodic points approximate the support of any invariant measure , generalizing the result for one - dimensional endomorphisms .",
    "our argument also provides a simpler proof of the result presented in @xcite ( see the section  [ sec measures ] ) and also proving that periodic points are dense in the non - wandering set of a campact real tree as defined above .",
    "[ t.measure revisited ] for @xmath37 , @xmath11 , the support of any @xmath12-invariant probability @xmath15 is contained in the closure of the periodic points . in particular",
    "if @xmath12 preserves a non - atomic ergodic measure , then there are infinitely many periodic points with unbounded period .    as a consequence",
    "we obtain :    [ c.henon ] for any @xmath28 and for @xmath29 small , the support of any probability measure @xmath15 which is invariant by the hnon map @xmath41 is contained in the closure of the periodic points .",
