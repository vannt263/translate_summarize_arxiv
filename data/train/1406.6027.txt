    "because of the high expected dark matter ( dm ) density , the inner part of the galaxy is one of the prime targets for indirect searches for particle dm ( for recent reviews , see refs .",
    "indeed , indications for dm signals from the galactic center ( gc ) region have repeatedly appeared in the past  in particular in gamma rays @xcite , but also in microwaves @xcite and the annihilation radiation from positrons @xcite . this part of the galaxy , however , is also an astrophysically very rich environment .",
    "unless one can identify a distinct spectral signature @xcite , this generally makes disentangling any potential dm signal from astrophysical backgrounds a formidable task .",
    "in fact , more refined analyses and new data have so far always tended to disfavour the dm hypotheses previously put forward @xcite .",
    "the field has matured significantly in recent years however , concerning both the understanding of astrophysical backgrounds and the statistical analysis of potential signals , not the least because of the unprecedented wealth of high - quality data that now are at our disposal . at the same time , many theoretical models predict signals just below current exclusion limits .",
    "this implies both that more signal claims should be expected in the near future , and that those should not be dismissed too easily .",
    "an example for such a sophisticated analysis is the recent discussion of the gev gamma - ray excess in fermi - lat @xcite data of the gc and inner galaxy @xcite , which reconfirms corresponding earlier findings @xcite with a high level of detail ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the spectrum of the excess seen at the gc can be well described by the annihilation of @xmath0gev dm particles into quarks , or leptons , which then produce secondary photons during their fragmentation and decay .",
    "indeed , the signal normalization is consistent with that expected for thermally produced dm . the observed spectrum , however , does not contain the type of sharp features that would unambiguously point to a dm origin .",
    "it is thus arguably even more interesting that the signal is spherically symmetric and that it is claimed to extend to at least 1.5kpc away from the gc  @xcite , where astrophysical backgrounds with a similar morphology are expected to be strongly suppressed .",
    "last but not least , the excess emission decreases with galactocentric distance in a way that is consistent with the wide range of expectations for annihilating dm .",
    "not surprisingly , the most recent analysis of this excess @xcite has already triggered a considerable activity in concrete model - building attempts @xcite .",
    "if the excess can indeed be attributed to annihilating dm particles , this will also leave traces in other cosmic - ray fluxes .",
    "in fact , a confirmation of the dm hypothesis essentially _ requires _ to find corroborating evidence from a different type of experiment , and observations using other cosmic - ray messengers or photons at other wavelengths seem to be a particularly natural choice to look for such a second signal ( while the translation to expected rates in direct detection experiments or at colliders is much more model - dependent ) .",
    "given the renewed interest in the gc gamma - ray excess , we thus present here an updated collection of constraints deriving from indirect dm searches . in particular , we point out that the observed radial distribution of the gamma - ray signal essentially fixes the dm distribution in the inner galaxy , thereby significantly reducing the astrophysical uncertainties typically associated with such limits .",
    "this allows to reliably constrain the dm interpretation of the signal , almost independent of the dm profile and much less model - dependent than corresponding constraints derived from dm searches at colliders or in direct detection experiments @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sec : signal ] by reviewing the current situation of the gev excess , with an emphasis on the possibility that it is induced by annihilating dm . in section",
    "[ sec : constraints ] we present updated bounds on this interpretation from other indirect searches for dm , in particular using cosmic - ray antiprotons and positrons , as well as radio observations .",
    "we provide a more detailed discussion of systematic uncertainties for the most relevant limits in section [ sec : discussion ] , and a summary in terms of the main possible dm annihilation channels in context of the gc gev excess in section [ sec : summary ] . in section [ sec : concl ] , finally , we conclude .",
    "the dm interpretation of the excess emission at the gc is suggestive in a number of ways : the extended emission appears to peak relatively sharply at energies around 13 gev , is rotationally symmetric around the gc , and roughly follows a @xmath1 emission profile , compatible with the annihilation signal from a standard cuspy  if slightly contracted ",
    "dm distribution  @xcite . furthermore",
    ", the same spectral signature was claimed to extend to much higher galactic latitudes , @xmath2  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "indeed , a signal from dm annihilation is in general expected to extend to high latitudes , and can even be visible at the galactic poles if the substructure enhancement of the annihilation signal is significant at cosmological distances .",
    "astrophysical explanations in terms of milli - second pulsars ( msps ) , bremsstrahlung or neutral pion decay close to the gc are not yet excluded , but would all face serious challenges if  despite the sizeable systematic uncertainties @xcite  the extension of the gev excess to galactic latitudes of @xmath3 is confirmed .",
    "it should in fact be stressed that the nominal statistical significance of the excess is extremely high ( _ e.g. _  at the level of @xmath4 in the inner galaxy analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and that by now background modeling uncertainties are the main limiting factor in characterizing its properties .",

    "when extrapolating the excess emission observed at the gc to other points in the galaxy , the main unknown is the shape of the galactic dm halo and the distribution of dm substructures .",

    "note that we are eventually only interested in the _ ratio _ of various constraints to the putative signal , implying that the local dm density @xmath23 drops out and thus can be fixed to any value simply as a matter of convention . in that case , the variation of the annihilation rate at the sun s position corresponds to a variation of the annihilation cross - section itself .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors find slopes @xmath27 ( at @xmath28 cl ) from an analysis of the inner galaxy ( excluding the inner one degree above and below the galactic disc ) , and a value of @xmath29@xmath30 from an analysis of the gc source .",

    "due to tidal forces , the associated boost at the gc is in general expected to be negligible ; at kpc distances it can however lead to @xmath32 enhancements of the effective annihilation rate ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",

    "the main argument against a significant contribution of msps to the gc excess is that it appears to be non - trivial to find plausible source distributions that completely remain below the _ fermi _  lat point source threshold  @xcite , while still being compatible with the emission properties of the pulsar population that is observed locally .    the emission of tev gamma rays in the galactic ridge region as observed by h.e.s.s .",

    "this strongly suggests that the diffuse tev gamma - ray emission is due to a hard population of cosmic - ray electrons or protons , producing gamma rays either via bremsstrahlung or proton  proton interactions .",
    "it is plausible that the same populations also contribute to the gc emission at gev energies . in the context of cosmic - ray electrons ,",
    "@xcite showed that the bremsstrahlung from an electron population compatible with the observed synchrotron emission at the gc could indeed produce the characteristic peaked gev excess emission .",
    "the main argument against the interpretation in terms of cosmic rays is the apparent extension of the gev excess to @xmath97kpc distances from the gc as well as its spherical symmetry , which does not resemble the distribution of detected gas ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",

    "on the other hand , there are no primary but only secondary sources of astrophysical antiprotons : these are produced through the collisions of cosmic rays , in particular protons , with the interstellar medium .",

    "the product @xmath227 , on the other hand , determines the dependence on @xmath154 ( implying in fact slightly stronger limits for weaker magnetic fields ) . in the limit of @xmath228 , corresponding to large magnetic field values , @xmath173 approaches a constant and the synchrotron flux scales as @xmath229 . in general , @xmath173 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath174 , which implies that the actual @xmath154-dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : synflux ] ) will in practice be smaller . an intuitive way to understand",
    "this relatively weak dependence of the flux density for a given frequency is that , in the limit of synchrotron losses happening _ in situ _ as discussed above , the value of @xmath154 does not affect anymore the total power radiated away but merely the frequency at which this happens .",
    "note also that for larger magnetic fields @xmath154 , we do not need to follow the super - conservative approach of only integrating up to 1  pc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bfield ] ) .",
    "this implies that  in case of cored profiles  limits will realistically weaken even less with increased magnetic field values .    , but for constant magnetic fields of strength @xmath230 ( dot - dashed lines ) , @xmath231 ( dotted lines ) , and our baseline magnetic field model ( solide lines ) .",

    "fig : radioallchann ] .",
    "interestingly , the case of a constant magnetic field of @xmath233 leads indeed to very similar limits . at dm masses @xmath235gev , limits _ weaken _ as expected with a factor of @xmath236 when instead adopting the much larger constant field of @xmath234 . at low masses ,",
    "they may however even _ strengthen _ due to the @xmath173 dependence discussed above . in both cases",
    ", we see that dm annihilation into 80% @xmath59 + 20% @xmath38 leads to limits that exclude the interpretation of the excess in terms of such annihilations , whereas a large magnetic field of @xmath234 would require a slightly smaller core size in the profile , @xmath237pc , to fully exclude also the possibility of @xmath5 final states .",
    "let us conclude this section by mentioning a very recent analysis  @xcite which revisited radio constraints on dm annihilation in the gc .",
    "in particular , this analysis challenges the standard assumption of _ in situ _ energy losses of the emitted electrons due to synchrotron radiation when taking into account inverse compton scattering ( ics ) , or strong convective winds in the inner galaxy . for the magnetic field model that we have adopted , e.g. ,",
    "the limits are claimed to weaken by more than two orders of magnitude when including ics off the dense interstellar radiation field close to the gc ( but note that the actual @xmath154-field is likely stronger , as discussed above , which would make ics less important in proportion ) .",
    "together with the assumption of a very strong convective wind that blows electrons away from the galactic disk with a velocity of @xmath238km / s , this would result in a weakening of our limits by less than 4 orders of magnitude in total . for a steep profile with @xmath31",
    ", however , even this extreme case is not sufficient to make the gc excess compatible with radio observations unless one introduces an artificial cutoff at @xmath239pc .",
    "+        in fig .  [ fig : summary ] we present a summary of the constraints on dm annihilation that we derived from antiproton , positron and radio observations , and confront them with representative benchmark scenarios that can explain the gc gev excess observed with fermi lat . since the annihilation cross - section that best reproduces the gamma - ray signal depends on the assumption on the dm profile , in particular the inner slope @xmath22 and the local dm density , in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] we normalize the annihilation cross - section to the values that best reproduce the gev excess ( _ cp .",
    "_  tab .",
    "[ tab : cross - sections ] ) . in this way",
    ", we collapse the best - fit regions into one single region , which is per construction centered onto one .",
    "the limits change then according to the slope @xmath22 ( and the scale radius @xmath57 , which we will comment on below ) , whereas the overall normalization of the dm profile drops out ( as do symmetry factors in the annihilation rate related to whether or not the dm particles are their own antiparticles ) .    in case of dm annihilation into @xmath5 final states , as shown in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] , limits from existing observations of antiprotons firmly exclude the dm interpretation of the gev excess by almost one order of magnitude , if our benchmark kra scenario is adopted for the propagation of galactic cosmic rays . these limits weaken by about a factor of two if @xmath22 increases from @xmath41 to @xmath31 .",
    "note that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - dependence ] , variations in the scale radius @xmath57 introduce another uncertainty in the _ local _ annihilation rate that can be as large as a factor of two , which in case of very cuspy profiles ( like @xmath31 ) will typically tend to _ increase _ the annihilation signal when mass constraints on the milky way are taken into account . however , we checked explicitly that the antiproton limits  which probe a relatively large annihilation volume  are only strengthened by 24% ( weakened by 39% ) when changing our references value of @xmath57 from 20kpc to 35kpc ( 10kpc ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbar_limits_prop ] , in case of the very conservative min propagation scenario the limits can weaken by an additional factor of 78 . only in this extreme propagation",
    "setting , the gev excess would still be marginally consistent with current antiproton observations  implying that ams-02 will either observe a corresponding excess in antiprotons or rule out even this remaining possibility .",
    "we also show limits obtained from 408mhz jodrell bank radio observations of the inner 4  centered on the gc . as discussed above , these limits are rather robust concerning assumptions on the magnetic field , but they critically depend on the adopted dm profile .",
    "most importantly , in case of the gamma - ray excess , the dm profile is fixed to a large extent , allowing to make much more precise signal predictions . for a profile that remains cuspy all the way down to @xmath240 ,",
    "all channels that could explain the gev excess are ruled out by several orders of magnitude  ( _ cp . _  fig .",
    "[ fig : radiotautau ] )  though these limits become much less severe when allowing for strong convective winds or ics to dominate over synchrotron emission @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] , we show limits that are obtained for an _ ad hoc _ flattening of the generalized nfw profile at radii below 2 pc . even with such an artificial core , in case of the cuspy @xmath31 the limits still exclude the dm interpretation of the gev excess by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "note that gc radio observations only probe the innermost region of the dm halo .",
    "the resulting limits thus do not depend on the scale radius @xmath57 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - dependence ] . for the same reason , steeper profiles imply much _ stronger _ radio constraints in the context of the gev excess , while they imply slightly _ weaker _ constraints for antiprotons . in case of dm annihilation into @xmath74 or light quarks @xmath77 ( upper right and lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ) , the limits obtained from radio and antiproton observations are quantitatively very similar to the case of @xmath5 .    in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] , we finally show limits on the mixed final state @xmath59 ( 80% ) plus @xmath5 ( 20% ) , which was motivated in ref .",
    "@xcite by a spectral fit to the excess seen in the inner galaxy ( see also the discussion in section [ sec : gevdm ] ) . in this case ,",
    "antiproton constraints only lead to an exclusion by a factor of roughly 2 in case of the kra propagation scenario ( and no exclusion if the min model is adopted ) .",
    "however , radio limits firmly exclude this channel for a dm profile that remains cuspy down to at least 2 pc .",
    "additional robust constraints derive from the shape analysis @xcite of the flux of cosmic - ray positrons as measured by ams-02 , which again marginally excludes the interpretation of the gamma - ray gev excess in terms of dm annihilation into @xmath59 final states for a cuspy profile with @xmath31 ( as preferred by the inner galaxy analysis of ref .",
    "as discussed above ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : triangle ] and  [ fig : triangle2 ] ) , these limits are _ much _ stronger in case of other leptonic final states , and exclude branching ratios into @xmath131 down to about @xmath241 , and down to @xmath242 in case of @xmath132 final states .",
    "note that uncertainties related to the scale radius @xmath57 of the dm profile are larger than for antiprotons and can in principle be as large as a factor of two ; for @xmath31 , however , they tend to _ increase _ the local annihilation signal .",
    "we recall that a larger contribution of @xmath243 final states than 80% results in a spectrum that no longer provides a reasonable fit to the observed gev excess , even when taking into account the contribution from bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering .",
    "a smaller contribution , on the other hand , necessarily implies a larger @xmath38 ( or lighter quark ) contribution in view of the strong ams-02 limits on light leptons as annihilation products .",
    "while a mixed final state with a smaller @xmath143 component could evade ams-02 bounds , the antiproton bounds from pamela would thus become even more severe .",
    "_ in summary _",
    ", we find that the dm interpretation of the gev excess in terms of hadronic or leptonic final states is strongly constrained by our analysis of existing antiproton , positron and radio data",
    ". a way to make these limits even more robust would be to study diffusion parameters , in particular the truly minimal diffusion zone height , in light of existing radio , gamma - ray and cosmic - ray observations in a _ combined _ analysis .",
    "for the case of antiproton limits , the most important next step would then be to systematically improve on the nuclear uncertainties connected to secondary antiproton production . for positron limits on @xmath59 final states ,",
    "on the other hand , a dedicated study of the effects of solar modulation on the spectrum of dm induced positrons below energies of @xmath244 would be more warranted . avoiding the radio limits we have presented",
    "requires a dedicated discussion of what mechanisms could give rise to a dm profile that is cuspy in the inner galaxy , down to @xmath188pc scales , but has a core with an extension of a few pc at its center .",
    "last but not least , it will certainly help to get a better handle on the systematics connected to the determination of the dm profile slope @xmath22 , as well as the scale radius @xmath57 , from gamma - ray and dynamical observations .    while all those possible directions of further investigation clearly lie beyond the scope of the present study , they certainly indicate that there is room to make indirect dm searches even more competitive  especially for light dm models , but independently of the concrete application of the gev gamma - ray excess currently claimed at the gc and inner galaxy .",
    "in this article , we have revisited current bounds from indirect searches for dm and identified the messengers and targets that are most relevant for light dm , i.e.  for masses roughly below 100gev :    * for dm annihilation into light charged leptons , _ positrons _ provide the most stringent and robust bounds @xcite .",
    "this constrains the thermal annihilation rate of @xmath245@xmath70s@xmath121 for masses of roughly @xmath246gev ( @xmath247gev ) assuming dominant annihilation to @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) final states . *",
    "as has been pointed out earlier , _ antiprotons _ provide a very efficient means of constraining light dm annihilating into quarks @xcite . here , we have derived new bounds that constrain the thermal annihilation rate for @xmath248gev in the case of @xmath38 final states , and for @xmath249gev if annihilation into light quarks dominates . * null - searches for 408mhz _ radio signals _ from a 4  region around the gc , finally , provide extremely stringent constraints @xcite .",
    "we revisited those bounds and discussed that the dependence on assumptions about the magnetic field is typically much smaller than that related to the dm density at pc scales away from the gc . for a cuspy profile ( like nfw ) that extends down to at least 0.1pc",
    ", thermal cross sections are excluded for dm masses below roughly 120 gev ( for @xmath59 ) or even 400 gev ( for @xmath63 ) .    as an application ,",
    "we have discussed at length that these findings are particularly relevant for a possible dm interpretation of the much - debated excess in gev gamma rays from the gc and inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "in fact , such an interpretation requires a well - defined and highly constrained region both in the @xmath11 vs.  @xmath12 plane and in the range of possible dm density profiles .",
    "this implies that constraints from other indirect detection methods can directly be applied and are subject to much less severe uncertainties than in the absence of a signal indication .",
    "for example , these constraints become independent of the overall normalization of the annihilation rate and thus , e.g. , of the dm production mechanism .",
    "in fact , probing the same annihilation mechanism , such constraints are much more model - independent than constraints derived from collider or direct searches @xcite .    for reasonable benchmark scenarios for cosmic - ray propagation and a dm density profile consistent with the observed excess",
    ", we basically find that all annihilation channels that were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite are ruled out ( the same holds for purely leptonic annihilation channels , which were suggested in ref .",
    "the tension can be somewhat alleviated by ( a ) assuming a borderline propagation scenario with minimal diffusion zone height ( our min ) _ and _ ( b ) assuming that the dm profile cuts off at radii of at least @xmath250 from the galactic center ( while keeping its @xmath31 slope observed at larger radii @xmath251pc ) .",
    "on the model - building side , the tension could also be made somewhat less severe by considering cascade decays @xcite rather than the direct decay into two sm particle final states that we have considered here .",
    "while a thorough investigation of this possibility lies beyond the scope of this work , we do not expect our conclusions to change qualitatively .",
    "a confirmation of the dm interpretation of the gev excess clearly requires corroborating evidence from multiple observations . while this could also come from collider or direct probes",
    ", indirect searches arguably provide the most model - independent way of testing the signal . even though the excess is already in rather strong tension with these searches ,",
    "it is conceivable that the individual uncertainties of the respective limits ( as discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] and summarized in section [ sec : summary ] ) conspire such that a signal interpretation would still be viable . in this case , an independent confirmation of the gev excess as a dm signal  if indeed true  is likely to be just around the corner .",

    "<S> the apparent gamma - ray excess in the galactic center region and inner galaxy has attracted considerable interest , notably because both its spectrum and radial distribution are consistent with an interpretation in terms of annihilating dark matter particles with a mass of about @xmath0gev . </S>",
    "<S> we confront such an interpretation with an updated compilation of various indirect dark matter detection bounds , which we adapt to the specific form required by the observed signal . </S>",
    "<S> we find that cosmic - ray positron data strongly rule out dark matter annihilating to light leptons , or democratically to all leptons , as an explanation of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> cosmic - ray antiprotons , for which we present independent and significantly improved limits with respect to previous estimates , are already in considerable tension with dm annihilation to any combination of quark final states ; the first set of ams-02 data will thus be able to rule out or confirm the dm hypothesis with high confidence . for reasonable assumptions about the magnetic field in the galactic center region , </S>",
    "<S> radio observations independently put very severe constraints on a dm interpretation of the excess , in particular for all leptonic annihilation channels . </S>"
