    "the standard model ( sm ) of strong and electroweak interactions possesses only one source of cp violating phases : the phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "while the physical origin of this phase remains unknown , it appears to satisfactorily account for the observed cp violation in the k meson system , and future data from b factories and high energy accelerators will be able to test its validity for b meson phenomena .",
    "it was early on realized that supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model allowed for an array of new cp violating phases , and that these phases could give large contributions to the electric dipole moments [ edms ] of the electron and neutron @xcite , thus violating the known experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "several resolutions to this problem have been proposed , e.g. one might assume the phases are quite small i.e. @xmath3@xcite , or suppress the diagrams by assuming the relevant susy particles are very heavy @xcite .",
    "both these suggestions a priori appear unsatisfactory , i.e. the first possibility would appear to require a significant amount of fine tuning , and the second would imply a susy spectrum in the tev domain , possibly beyond the reach of even the lhc .",
    "more recently , it has been realized that some cancellations can occur in different contributions to the edms in certain parts of the susy parameter space @xcite which has led to considerable examination of this possibility @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm , the mssm , ( which we define as the low energy susy extension of the sm obtained by supersymmetrizing the particle spectrum with two higgs doublets )",
    "this does appear to reduce the amount of fine tuning needed , allowing for larger phases .",
    "the existence of such phases could also have effects on other predictions of the mssm @xcite , thus allowing future experimental checks of this idea .",
    "in this paper we consider these questions from the viewpoint of supergravity ( sugra ) grand unified models ( guts ) .",
    "in particular we consider gravity mediated models with r - parity invariance , where supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector at some scale above the gut scale @xmath4 ( presumably at the string or planck scale @xmath5 ) , the breaking being transmitted to the physical sector by gravity @xcite .",
    "( for previous work from this viewpoint see refs.@xcite . )",
    "such models are much more constrained than the mssm .",
    "thus low energy properties are now determined by running the renormalization group equations ( rge ) from @xmath4 to the electroweak scale .",
    "cp violating phases that in the mssm are arbitrary parameters now get correlated by the rge , and no longer can be assigned independently to satisfy the edm experimental bounds .",
    "further , the radiative breaking of @xmath6 puts additional constraints on the cp violating phases .",
    "we find that as a consequence of these constraints , one must still fine tune some of the cp violating phases at the electroweak scale to be quite small , except for small regions of the parameter space with tan@xmath1 close to its minimum value , or when susy masses are very large .",
    "further , except for the lowest tan@xmath1 a serious fine tuning develops at the gut scale .",
    "these phenomena appear to be true both for the minimal msugra model with universal soft breaking masses , and with nonuniversal soft breaking extensions .",
    "hence the required smallness of the phases also tends to reduce the possibility of collateral evidence in other phenomena for their existence in sugra models .    in sec.2",
    ", we discuss the solutions of the rge for msugra models and explain which phases that are large at the gut scale get naturally suppressed at the electroweak scale ( and which do not ) , and what the constraints of electroweak breaking imply both at the tree and 1-loop level .",
    "we then examine the amount of fine tuning needed to satisfy the existing edm data , and what would be needed if those data were improved by a factor of 10 without finding any edm .",
    "sec.3 considers some effects of nonuniversal soft breaking on the edm results .    in gravity mediated sugra models",
    ", the structure of the soft breaking parameters is to be deduced from the nature of the kahler potential and gauge kinetic function at the gut scale @xcite .",
    "thus what might be reasonable sizes for cp violating phases are presumably planck scale physics questions .",
    "while at present there is no theory of such phenomena , one can still examine the general framework to see under what circumstances small or large phases might occur `` naturally '' at the gut scale .",
    "this is analyzed in sec.4 , and a model with `` naturally '' small cp violating phases is discussed .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec.5 .",
    "supergravity gut models with universal soft breaking of supersymmetry , msugra , depend upon five parameters at the gut scale : @xmath7 ( the universal gaugino mass ) , @xmath8 ( the cubic soft breaking mass , @xmath9 ( the quadratic soft breaking mass ) , @xmath10 ( the higgs mixing parameter ) and @xmath11 ( the universal squark and slepton mass ) . of these",
    ", the first four may be complex .",
    "however , it is always possible to make a phase transformation on the gaugino fields to make @xmath7 real , and since the reality is preserved by the rge at 1-loop order , we will assume for now on that @xmath7 is real .",
    "we parameterize the remaining phases at @xmath4 by : @xmath12 the rge allow one to determine the low energy parameters in terms of those of eq.([amb ] ) and @xmath7 and @xmath11 . thus at the electroweak scale , one obtains a different a parameter for each fermion ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , real gaugino masses @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 sectors , and complex @xmath25 and @xmath26 parameters .",
    "the edm , @xmath27 for fermion f , appears in the effective lagrangian @xmath28 as @xmath29 the basic diagrams giving rise to @xmath27 are shown in fig.[fig1 ] , and involve neutralino ( @xmath30 , i=1,4 ) , chargino ( @xmath31 , i=1,2 ) and gluino ( @xmath32 ) loops with squarks ( @xmath33 ) and sleptons ( @xmath34 ) .    for the neutron dipole moment @xmath35",
    "one must also take into account the gluonic operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the su(3 ) structure constants and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the su(3 ) gell - mann matrices .",
    "in addition to the diagrams of fig.[fig1 ] with @xmath42 replaced by @xmath43 , operators of eqs.([lag]-[lc ] ) receive contributions from the two loop barr - zee diagrams of fig.[fig2]@xcite , and the two loop weinberg type diagram of fig.[fig3 ] @xcite . for the neutron dipole moment one must use the qcd factors @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 to evolve the results at the electroweak scale down to 1 gev @xcite .    the calculation of @xmath35 suffers from qcd uncertainties from several sources .",
    "these include :    \\(1 ) how to relate the quark moments @xmath47 , @xmath48 to the neutron moment @xmath35 .",
    "we use here the non relativistic quark model relation .",
    "( for other approaches see ref.@xcite . )",
    "@xmath49 ( 2 ) how to relate color and gluonic contributions to the electric dipole moment .",
    "we use here the `` naive dimensional analysis '' of ref.@xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) uncertainty in @xmath50 , the strange quark mass , which affects the determination of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "thus the values of @xmath35 calculated below have a significant uncertainty . in spite of this , it is useful to see the effect on the susy parameter space of simultaneously imposing the experimental constraints on both @xmath35 and @xmath56 and we will discuss below how the uncertainty in @xmath50 effects these constraints .    to specify our phase conventions , we give the mass matrices for the particles entering in fig.[fig1 ] . with a convenient choice of phases , the chargino and the neutralino mass matrices",

    "the squark mass matrices may be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the quark mass and charge,@xmath73 @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given in ibanez et al . @xcite and @xmath77 for u(d ) quarks .",
    "similar expressions hold for slepton masses , with phases @xmath78 .",
    "our sign conventions for @xmath79 and @xmath26 are those of ref.@xcite .",
    "the condition for electroweak symmetry breaking is obtained by minimizing the effective potential @xmath80 with respect to @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the higgs sector of @xmath80 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the one loop contribution , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the @xmath89 running masses . for particles of spin j one has @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the color degree of freedom of the @xmath92 particle . in the following we choose the low energy scale @xmath93 to be @xmath94 ( 175 gev ) , and include the full third generation states , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 in @xmath86 .",
    "this allows an examination of the large tan@xmath1 domain .",
    "we view the minimization equations of @xmath80 as equations to determine the higgs vevs i.e. @xmath98 .",
    "thus in the tree approximation , the extrema equations @xmath99 yield @xmath100 , and hence the minimum of @xmath80 requires @xmath101 ( the choice of @xmath102 leads to a maximum ) .",
    "the one loop corrections depend only on the mass eigenvalues , and hence from eq.([sqrk ] ) only on the phase @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "thus , at the one loop level , one gets a correction to eq.([theta ] ) of the form@xcite @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the one loop correction with @xmath66 approximated by its tree value , eq.([theta ] ) .",
    "as we will see , this correction can become significant for large tan@xmath1 .",
    "the edms however depend on both the mass eigenvalues and the rotation matrices .",

    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig4 ] where @xmath113 is plotted vs. @xmath11 for the electron dipole moment ( eedm ) .",
    "we note that eventually for very large @xmath11 , the curves fall below the @xmath111 bound ( as expected ) .",

    "in addition , the position of the dips moves to lower @xmath11 with increasing tan@xmath1 .",
    "this happens due to the fact that the regions on the right of the dips are dominated by the contribution from the chargino diagram .",
    "as tan@xmath1 increases , the contribution from the chargino diagram increases much more than the contribution from the neutralino diagram .",
    "however , a decrease in @xmath11 increases the neutralino diagram much more than the chargino diagram . as a result the dips shift towards the smaller @xmath11 value for larger tan@xmath1 .",

    "we have used ref.@xcite for the rge relating the gut scale parameters to the parameters at the electroweak scale . in general ,",
    "the rge must be solved numerically and all results given below are obtained by accurate numerical integration .",

    "( this result has been previously observed , for low tan@xmath1 in @xcite . ) the approximate so(10 ) solution with large tan@xmath1 ( where @xmath136 ) gives a similar analytic form for @xmath137 with the factor 6 replaced by 7 in eq.([d0 ] ) .",

    "these effects thus allow @xmath138 to be large without a priori violating the experimental edm bounds .",

    ", one sees that the phase of the @xmath26 parameter does not run at the 1-loop level , i.e. @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the phase at the electroweak scale .",

    "we see that @xmath147 can be large i.e. @xmath148 , for low @xmath149 , though it becomes smaller for higher @xmath150 .",

    "the rge for @xmath25 and @xmath15 can be solved in the low and intermediate tan@xmath1 regime to obtain @xmath160 where @xmath161{\\alpha_g\\over{4\\pi } } \\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath162 , @xmath163 is the gut gauge coupling constant and @xmath164 are the mssm beta functions .",
    "the real and the imaginary parts of eq.([b ] ) give : @xmath165 @xmath166 eqs.([bsin],[bcos ] ) can be viewed as determining the electroweak scale values of @xmath167 and @xmath147 in terms of the gut input parameters .",
    "thus @xmath147 depends upon both the initial phase @xmath168 and the @xmath8 phase @xmath138 .",
    "alternatively , one may use eqs.([bsin],[bcos ] ) to impose electroweak scale phenomenological constraints on the allowed gut parameters .",
    "the requirement that the gut theory gives rise to electroweak symmetry breaking gives @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",

    "these conditions put severe constraints on the gut scale theory which we now discuss .",
    "consider first the case where tan@xmath1 is very close to its minimum value e.g. tan@xmath1=2 . here",
    "@xmath175 is not small and by eq.([bmag ] ) , @xmath167 is of normal size .",
    "eq.([bsin ] ) then implies that @xmath147 and @xmath168 are of roughly the same size ( even for @xmath134 ) as previously noted in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus a reasonable gut theory requires one only to justify the size of @xmath168 .",
    "however , as tan@xmath1 increases , @xmath175 decreases , and unless @xmath26 becomes anomalously small or @xmath176 anomalously large , eq.([bmag ] ) implies that @xmath167 becomes small .",
    "thus the lefthand side of eq.([bsin ] ) becomes small ( and to first approximation can be neglected ) , and eq.([bsin ] ) implies that @xmath168 is determined by @xmath138 mainly , i.e. @xmath168 is large if @xmath138 is large .",
    "this result is illustrated in fig.[fig7 ] where @xmath168 is plotted vs. @xmath147 .",
    "we see that since @xmath147 is small for all tan@xmath1 , @xmath168 is in general large , e.g. even for tan@xmath177 one has @xmath178 .",
    "returning to eq.([bsin ] ) , we see , however , that @xmath179 , the range of values of @xmath168 that will satisfy the edm constraints , is very small . thus for fixed @xmath8 , eq.([bsin ] ) implies for large tan@xmath1 that @xmath180 and since @xmath152 is small , @xmath179 will be very small .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig8 ] where the allowed values of @xmath168 for @xmath114 are plotted vs. @xmath7 for @xmath56 and @xmath35 for tan@xmath1=3 , 10 , 20 .",
    "we see that the phenomenological constraints at the electroweak scale imply that @xmath168 is both large and its value is sharply fine tuned ( unless @xmath138 is small , susy masses are large or tan@xmath1 is small ) .",
    "one may alternatively view this from the `` top down '' : if planck physics determines @xmath138 and @xmath168 to be large and fixed , then if the model is to achieve electroweak symmetry breaking with edms below existing bounds , there will be a fine tuning of other gut scale parameters ( unless tan@xmath1 is small or the susy masses are large ) .    as discussed above ,",
    "there are a number of uncertainties in the calculation of the neutron edm .",
    "fig.[fig9 ] illustrates the effects of varying the d - quark mass in a plot of the region allowed by the experimental edm bounds ( @xmath114 ) in the @xmath181 plane for @xmath182 , @xmath183 gev , @xmath134 , tan@xmath1=3 .",
    "the bound on @xmath56 already excludes all regions below the lower solid curve , while the @xmath35 bound excludes regions to the left of the upward running curves for @xmath184 mev ( dotted ) , @xmath185 mev ( solid ) , @xmath186 mev ( dashed ) .",
    "thus the combined exclusion region increases from @xmath187 gev to @xmath188 gev as @xmath52 increases , a significant change . in the other figures in this paper",
    "we have used the middle value of @xmath185 mev corresponding to @xmath189 mev .    in fig.[fig9 ] , we have chosen @xmath182 .",
    "as one increases @xmath147 , one will eventually arrive at a neutralino - chargino cancellation region , and this will reduce the values of @xmath11 and @xmath7 which are excluded . further , for low tan@xmath1 this cancellation can occur at relatively large @xmath147 ( i.e. @xmath190 ) as shown in ref.@xcite . alternatively , increasing tan@xmath1 can also cause this cancellation , as the loop corrections , eq.([thetaf ] ) , become large with large tan@xmath1 and the contribution from the chargino diagram increases with tan@xmath1 .",
    "this is illustrated for tan@xmath1=20 in fig.[fig10 ] where the @xmath35 curve for @xmath111 ( solid ) bends downward below @xmath11=500 gev when 200 gev@xmath191 gev , showing in this exceptional type situation that one can satisfy the edm constraints with a light particle spectrum and large tan@xmath1 .",

    "the regions of the susy parameter space that get eliminated by a joint imposition of the experimental bounds on the @xmath56 and @xmath35 are sensitive , of course , to the choice of the parameters .",

    "fig.[fig11 ] shows that if @xmath11 is increased to 250 gev one requires now @xmath195 gev ( @xmath196 gev ) to satisfy both bounds , i.e. if @xmath11 is increased , the lower bound on @xmath7 is decreased as expected .",

    "for example , for @xmath7=220 gev and tan@xmath1=5 , @xmath232 occurs for @xmath233 gev in the non universal case , whereas @xmath232 occurs for @xmath234 gev in the universal case .",
    "the particular set of @xmath230s in the fig.[fig15 ] is chosen to reduce the stop and the sbottom mass and to satisfy the requirement of the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the lower stop and sbottom mass increases the weinberg type diagram which has a subtractive effect in the net nedm magnitude .",
    "while choosing the cp violating phases to be small , i.e. @xmath235 , to satisfy the edm constraints appears to be artificial in the low energy mssm , it is possible that a natural model of this type can arise in sugra gut models .",
    "sugra models depend on three functions of the chiral fields @xmath236 : @xmath237 the gauge kinetic energy , @xmath238 the kahler potential and @xmath239 the superpotential .",
    "one assumes a hidden sector exists where some fields , e.g. moduli or dilaton , @xmath240 grow vevs of planck size to break supersymmetry i.e. @xmath241 where @xmath242 gev .",
    "thus one can write @xmath243 where @xmath244 are the physical sector fields",
    ". one might expand the kahler potential in a power series of the physical fields : @xmath245 where @xmath246 is a large mass .",
    "the @xmath247 are dimensionless and we assume them to be @xmath248 .",
    "the first parenthesis is holomorphic , and can be transferred to the superpotential by a kahler transformation giving rise to the @xmath26 term : @xmath249 the leading additional terms on the right occur when @xmath250 there is replaced by its vev ( @xmath251 ) and one of the fields in the cubic term , e.g. @xmath252 , has a gut scale vev",
    ". then @xmath253 , where @xmath254 in the perturbative heterotic string we expect @xmath255 and hence @xmath256 .",
    "if one assumes @xmath257 is real and @xmath258 is complex with arbitrary size phase , then @xmath26 naturally has a phase of size @xmath259 .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for the other parameters ( a , b , @xmath260 ) yielding automatically small phases .",
    "one assumes only that the leading ( renormalizable ) term in the matter expansion is real , while the higher terms ( presumably arising from integrating out the tower of massive states ) can have arbitrary phases .",
    "other string scenarios can have @xmath261 . in that case one",
    "expects the nonrenormalizable terms to give rise to large phases , unless the low lying members of the tower of heavy states do not couple to the fields of the physical sector .",
    "in sugra gut models , the basic parameters are given at the gut scale .",
    "the renormalization group equations then carry this information to the electroweak scale , allowing for experimental tests of the model .",
    "thus what represents a `` natural '' choice of parameters is presumably a gut scale question .",
    "the experimental values of the electric dipole moments put strong constraints on the low energy susy parameter space .",
    "however , for msugra models at least , the rge suppress the value of the @xmath15 phase at the electroweak scale , @xmath135 , so that any size of phase , @xmath138 , even @xmath262 at @xmath4 will generally lead to acceptable edms .",
    "this effect is due to the nearness of the t - quark to its landau pole .",
    "the edms , however , are very sensitive to the b phase at the electroweak scale , @xmath147 . in the domain of light susy mass spectrum ( i.e. @xmath01 tev ) and @xmath263 ,",
    "the edms allow a large @xmath147 ( i.e. @xmath264 only for low tan@xmath1 , i.e. tan@xmath265 .",
    "further , for fixed susy parameters in this domain , the allowed range @xmath152 of @xmath147 needed to satisfy the edm constraints is very small for tan@xmath266 .",
    "the above results strongly affect the gut theory .",
    "thus for @xmath138 large and a light mass spectrum one finds at the gut scale that @xmath168 is generally large , i.e. @xmath248 even for low tan@xmath1 , and the allowed range @xmath179 for satisfying the edms is exceedingly small for tan@xmath267 .",
    "thus for this situation , @xmath168 must be chosen large and be very precisely determined as tan@xmath1 gets large , leading to a new fine tuning problem at the gut scale . the origin of this difficulty resides in the requirement that the gut models give rise to parameters at the electroweak scale that simultaneously satisfy the experimental edm constraints and give rise to radiative electroweak breaking .",
    "the above discussion suggests that reasonable msugra models with large phases and mass spectrum below 1 tev can only be constructed for small tan@xmath1 i.e. tan@xmath265 .",
    "the current lep data combined with cosmological constraints already require tan@xmath268 @xcite , and lep , the tevatron and the lhc will be able to explore the domain tan@xmath269@xcite .",
    "thus the value of tan@xmath1 ( or a lower bound ) is something that will be determined experimentally in the not too distant future .",
    "should tan@xmath1 turn out to be large , it is possible that only models with small gut phases @xmath270 are reasonable , and it was shown above that such models can arise naturally with @xmath271 .",
    "our analysis has included the loop corrections to the radiative breaking condition . while these corrections are small , they grow with tan@xmath1 and are competitive to the @xmath147 contribution to the edms .",
    "thus for large tan@xmath1 ( e.g. tan@xmath272 ) they can produce a new cancellation phenomena ( with @xmath147=0 ) , allowing the edm constraints to be satisfied for a light mass spectra ( e.g. @xmath273300 gev , @xmath274 200 gev ) which for lower tan@xmath1 would be excluded by the edm data .    the combined restrictions of the experimental edm bounds for the neutron and electron put strong constraints on the susy parameter space . however , since the theoretical cancellations needed to satisfy experiment are delicate , as one varies the parameters one can get rather different excluded regions .",
    "thus , while we have found that increasing @xmath11 gives an allowed region of smaller @xmath7 ( as one might have expected ) , increasing @xmath275 can require @xmath7 to be increased to satisfy the edm bounds .",
    "however , it should be stressed that there are significant theoretical uncertainties in the calculation of @xmath35 , and we have seen , for example , that the current uncertainty in the quark masses @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( arising from the uncertainty in @xmath50 ) can lead to a significant variation in the domain the neutron edm data can exclude .    much of the above discussion holds also for non minimal models with non universal gaugino and sfermion soft breaking masses . a more detailed discussion of the effects of non universalities will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
