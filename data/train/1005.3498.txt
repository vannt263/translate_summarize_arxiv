    "however , we note that any frs calculated in this work shows @xmath126 @xmath55 0.12@xmath127 where @xmath127 is the total x - ray flux inferred from conventional spectral analysis .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of  ( 5.2@xmath9810@xmath128 erg  s@xmath34 ; boirin et al . 2005 ) corresponds to a mass transfer rate of 0.08@xmath129 ( the distance is 10 - 20 kpc and @xmath130 could be as high as 0.13@xmath129 ) .",
    "we suggest that this soft component originates in the boundary layer and is persistent over the two frequency ranges supported by radiation pressure as expected .",
    "in addition , @xmath17 ( an average spectrum over two years , balman 2009 ) , @xmath22 ( barnard et al .",
    "2001 ) and @xmath25 ( balucinska - church et al .",
    "2009 ) spectral analysis indicate similar blackbody temperatures between 1.0 - 1.7 kev ( overlapping within 95@xmath38 confidence level error range ) taken at different epochs and relatively different luminosities in a range 1 - 5.2@xmath9810@xmath128 erg  s@xmath34 .",
    "this supports the stability of an existing boundary layer emission ( see also sec . 1 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we need to stress that the appearance of blackbody emission in the low frequencies such as in this case is a typical feature of the frs of z sources ( e.g. , gilfanov & revnivtsev 2005 ) and the blackbody is , then , a disk - blackbody .",
    "however , a disk - blackbody with such temperatures would be atypically high for an atoll source ( like ) ( e.g. , tarana , bazzano @xmath47 ubertini 2008 ; di salvo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we find a different form of frs and hardening of the spectra in the two higher frequency ranges .",
    "the existence of a power - law spectra with an iron fluorescence k@xmath54 line at 6.4@xmath0 kev in the two frequency ranges 0.9 - 6 hz and 8 - 30 hz with the lowest normalization reveals reflection from a media located in the vicinity of the main source of emission . in the case for reflection from optically thick cold neutral medium , the main reflection features are a narrow unshifted iron fluorescence k@xmath54 line at 6.4 kev , an absorption edge at 7.1 kev and a reflected continuum emission peaked at 20 - 30 kev ( basko et al . 1974 ;",
    "george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "however , deviations from this reflection model ( e.g. , broad lines and smeared edges ) is detected in x - ray binaries indicating complicated ionization stages in or motion of the reflecting media ( e.g. , miller 2007 , cackett et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b , 2008 ; reis , fabian & young 2009 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2009 ; reynolds et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the complicated modelling of these modified lines show a line centered mainly on 6.4 kev ( errors in a range from 6.0 to 6.9 kev ) with large broadening of the widths ( equivalent widths in a range 50 - 400 ev ) including extended red - wings due to general relativistic effects ( i.e. , redshifts ) or comptonization in a hot inner corona . in the case for",
    "the spectral parameters on table 1 reveal that a cold / warm reflection model with the unshifted iron k@xmath131 line is plausible and in the 0.9 - 6 hz range .",
    "however , we calculate a @xmath5 @xmath55 0.5 kev for the width of the iron fluorescence line in the 0.9 - 6 hz range and a @xmath5 of 0.7@xmath56 kev in the 8 - 30 hz frequency band at a 90@xmath38 confidence level .",
    "the error on the central energy of the line ( i.e. , 6.1 - 6.6 kev ) and the large width of the line ( particularly in the 8 - 30 hz range ) allows for shifted and broad resonance fe line in the frs , as well .",
    "we detect broadening of the line width with increasing frequency as was detected in the frs analysis of cyg x-1 by revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in general",
    ", the parameters of the line is similar to the modified 6.4 kev fe fluorescence lines detected in other x - ray binaries .",
    "we calculate that the neutral hydrogen absorption , also , increases by a factor of 3 - 4 in the spectra at the two high frequency ranges .",
    "this strongly suggests that the frs method may have revealed the location of an absorbing medium in the persistent emission .",
    "particularly , the 0.9 - 6 hz frs shows the highest absorption due to neutral hydrogen as modeled in table 1 , but since the frs have low spectral resolution , the true absorption may be of any kind , warm or cold .    an emission line at 6.6 kev is also detected in the conventional spectral analysis of the persistent spectrum ( boirin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the analysis reveals a weak broad line with a fwhm of 2.0@xmath78 kev .",
    "as mentioned in the above paragraphs processes like relativistic broadening , compton scattering , rotational velocity broadening may be the reason for this large line broadening .",
    "the maximum limits of the line width we calculate from the frs are smaller than the fwhm derived from conventional spectral analysis .",
    "since the line in the conventional spectrum is weak , it is sensitive to the choice of the continuum emission . however , the large fwhm is a strong indication that it may be a blending between the iron fluorescence lines originating from the different parts of the disk ( i.e. , inner and outer disk ) .",
    "we believe that the two high frequency band spectra belong to the reflected emission and thus show a different spectra in comparison with the rest of the frequency bands that show blackbody emission from the disk .",
    "the conventional spectral analysis of the data shows a power - law emission component as the harder x - ray component with @xmath77=1.6 - 2.0 ( boirin et al .",
    "2005 ; church et al .",
    "2005 ) which is consistent with our results .",
    "we find that the psd of the persistent emission shows two lorentzian components around 1.4 and 2.8 hz at about 99@xmath38 confidence level .",
    "we belive this is consistent with the @xmath6 1 hz qpo previously detected from this system ( jonker et al .",
    "there has been two suggestions for the origin of the 1 hz qpo : 1 ) quasi - periodic obscuration of the central source by a structure in the disk producing relatively energy - independent oscillations ( jonker et al .",
    "1999 ) ; 2 ) global disk oscillations ( titarchuck & osherovich 2000 ) .",
    "jonker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that the qpo can not be explained with compton scattering alone since that would result in strong energy dependence of the qpo which is inconsistent with their findings .",
    "they suggest that the relatively low energy dependence may arise in a model with an intermediate temperature structure containing hot and cold electrons combining compton scattering with absorption .",
    "quasi - periodic obscuration of the central source emission by an opaque medium , an orbiting bump on the surface of the disk , may cause the qpo .",
    "the qpo exists in the persistent emission , the dips and the bursts consistently revealing the connection to our work that the source emission is incident on a reflector carrying its signature .",
    "the high inclination angle of the system also plays an important role .",
    "the high frequency frs ( 0.9 - 30 hz ) derived in this study supports this scenario for the qpos , since frs is best fitted with a power - law confirming the comptonizing nature and the absorption is then supported by the existence of the 6.4 kev fe k@xmath54 emission line and higher n@xmath132 parameter values from the fits . in the light of the spectral results , the qpos , and the 6.4 kev fe k@xmath54 emission line , we suggest that high frequency frs relates directly to reflection / reprocessing and scattering in the disk and the frequency bands used to derive the frs would yield a finite light crossing time of the reflector @xmath133=l@xmath50/c , also indicating the location of this region within the disk . for f=130 hz , l@xmath50 is c/2@xmath134f yielding a maximum size of 4.7@xmath9810@xmath135 cm for the reflector and a minimum size of 1.6@xmath9810@xmath136 cm that would also denote a minimum observable inner disk size ( the inner disk is at or closer than this limit ) .",
    "we suggest that the frs method applied in this work have recovered the reflected component in the system that had not been found before by conventional methods .",
    "exhibits iron fe xxv and fe xxvi absorption lines and the system is viewed relatively close to edge - on . in general , this is true for most of the dipping lmxbs . the conventional spectral analysis indicates a lack of orbital phase dependence of features except during dips suggesting that a highly - ionized absorber can be located in a thin cylindrical geometry around the compact object .",
    "this suggested location of the highly ionized absorber in lmxbs is mainly in the outer disk ( boirin et al .",
    "2005 ; diaz - trigo et al .",
    "2006 ) . in comparison with this scenario ,",
    "our frs analysis indicates that there is an absorbing region which is associated with the reflection zone in the inner regions of the disk at 4.7 - 0.2@xmath9810@xmath135 cm .",
    "however , we note that though we find an absorbing medium in the inner regions of the disk , we do not rule out another absorbing region ( possibly highly ionized ) which can exist somewhere in the outer disk .",
    "a different approach using dip - ingress timing for all the dipping lmxbs ( church @xmath47 balucinska - church 2004 ) indicates existence of extended accretion disk coronae ( adcs ) having radial extend typically 50000 km or 5 - 50@xmath38 of the accretion disk radius ( balucinska - church et al .",
    "the calculated size of an extended adc in  is @xmath62.7@xmath9810@xmath135 cm ( church @xmath47 balucinska - church 2004 ) with a temperature of about 44 kev .",
    "@xmath17 results show a temperature of about 196 kev in 4 - 200 kev range ( balman 2009 ) with an estimated location of a suggested adc at r @xmath55 1@xmath9810@xmath135 cm . the assumed location of the adc have some overlap with the reflection region size we calculated using our frs .",
    "then , the 6.4 kev line broadening and may be due to comptonization in an adc .",
    "we note that the size of the reflection region is 4.7 - 0.2@xmath9810@xmath135 cm as mentioned above and the general relativistic effects are detected within 40 - 1@xmath9810@xmath137 cm ( e.g. , papitto et al .",
    "2009 ; cackett et al .",
    "2009b ; reis et al . 2009 ) and may not explain the large equivalent widths and extended line widths .",
    "we note that ( using the @xmath17 results ) such a hot adc may possibly show band limited noise effects in harder energies and at relatively higher frequencies than the ones studied in this work .",
    "finally , we stress that we do not recover any absorption features ( i.e. , lines ) in the four frs we have calculated in this study which may rule out the existence of a highly ionized absorber within the inner zones of the accretion disk . however , if there were narrow weak absorption lines restricted to width @xmath5 @xmath55 0.14 kev and equivalent widths @xmath55 0.04 kev ( boirin et al . 2005 ) , our crude spectral resolution might have missed them out since we detect a strong fe fluorescence line at 6.4 kev .     against cumulative number of chance of occurrences for adding a single gaussian line in 1000 randomly simulated spectra .",
    "the null hypothesis spectra is a power - law with a neutral hydrogen absorption ( galactic ) .",
    "the @xmath58 values vary between 25 and 45 for 8 degrees of freedom .",
    "this line detection is over 99@xmath38 confidence level in the frequency resolved spectra .",
    ", width=302,height=328 ]",
    "we have analyzed the frequency resolved energy spectra ( frs ) of the low - mass x - ray binary dipper  during persistent emission in four different frequency bands using an archival observation .",
    "we recover two different continuum shapes for the four frequency ranges we have studied .",
    "we find that the frs shows a single blackbody component with kt in a range 1.0 - 1.4 kev for the variability in the frequency ranges 0.002 - 0.04 hz , and 0.07 - 0.3 hz . we attribute this component to the accretion disk and possibly emission from an existing boundary layer supported by radiation pressure .",
    "on the other hand , we stress that the emergence of a blackbody component in the lower frequency ranges and disappearance towards the higher frequencies suggests that it may also be a disk - blackbody emission given the frs properties derived for z - sources .",
    "we find a different form of frs for the frequency ranges 0.9 - 6 hz and 8 - 30 hz which is a power - law model together with a gaussian emission line at 6.4@xmath0 kev with an equivalent width of 1.6@xmath1 kev and 1.3@xmath2 kev for the two frequency ranges , respectively",
    ". the width @xmath5 of the line is @xmath55 0.5 kev and 0.7@xmath56 for the 0.9 - 6 hz and 8 - 30 hz ranges .",
    "in addition , we recover different neutral hydrogen column density for the frs derived in our work .",
    "the @xmath138 is highest in the 0.9 - 6.0 hz range with a value of 2.8@xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 and is only slightly lower for the 8.0 - 30.0 hz range , but lower by a factor of 3 - 4 in the 0.002 - 0.04 hz and 0.07 - 0.3 hz ranges .",
    "so , there is more associated absorption towards the inner disk and a distinct absorption difference for the two different continuum detected for the frs .",
    "we find that the emission structure within the inner regions of the disk is such that there is either boundary layer emission and an embedded reflection region with higher absorption towards the inner regions or there is a reflection region and an adc in the inner disk followed by a disk - blackbody towards the outer disk regions .",
    "the derived iron fluorescence line shows the existence of reflection / reprocessing in this system within the inner disk region .",
    "the size of the reflection region is in a range 4.7 - 0.16@xmath7 cm assuming light travel times .",
    "we suggest that the frs method applied in this work have recovered the reflected component in the system that had not been found before by conventional spectral methods .",
    "we stress that frs can be used in this manner to find reflection components in other lmxbs where conventional spectra can not be adequate . finally , we find that the 0.9 - 6 hz frequency band shows two qpo peaks at 1.4@xmath3 hz and 2.8@xmath4 hz at about 2.8 - 3.1 @xmath5 confidence level with integrated rms variability of 15@xmath38 and 11@xmath38 , respectively .",
    "we relate the origin of the qpos to the reflection phenomenon .",
    "the width of the 6.4 kev line increases with increasing frequency where the location , the qpos are produced , is the outer most regions of the reflection zone with the least spread in the line and the highest @xmath138 , thus , possibly a cold reflection zone ( i.e. , region with large clumps ) .",
