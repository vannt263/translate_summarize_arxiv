    "it then takes the form of a pfaffian , rather than a determinantal , relation .",

    "is satisfied .",
    "the polar decomposition allows us to compute @xmath145 this is an antisymmetric matrix , so it has a pfaffian , @xmath146 we have used the identity @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "we conclude that the topological quantum number can equivalently be written as @xmath149.\\label{qprimedef}\\ ] ]      to determine the topological quantum number of the disordered superconducting wire we seek the number of majorana bound states .",
    "particle - hole symmetry ensures that any bound state at zero energy is a majorana fermion ( since the creation and annihilation operators are related by @xmath150 and therefore are identical at @xmath151 ) .",
    "however , we can not directly search for zero - energy eigenstates : even if the majorana fermions are maximally separated by the entire length @xmath5 of the wire they will still have a nonzero tunnel coupling which splits their energies apart , away from zero .",
    "the issue here is how to distinguish strongly coupled from weakly coupled majorana fermions .",
    "any ordinary fermionic excitation , with distinct creation and annihilation operators @xmath152 , can be described by a pair of _ strongly coupled _",
    "majorana fermion operators @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "in contrast , the majorana bound states at opposite ends of the wire are _ weakly coupled _ majorana fermions .",
    "our geometry of a disordered wire connected at the ends to metal contacts allows for a natural distinction of weak versus strong coupling : we call a pair of majorana bound states `` strongly coupled '' if they are more strongly coupled to each other than to one of the ends of the wire .",
    "conversely , weakly coupled majorana bound states are more strongly coupled to one end of the wire than to any other majorana .",
    "the topological quantum number counts only weakly coupled majorana s .",
    "procedure to count weakly coupled majorana bound states in a disordered superconducting wire .",
    "majorana fermions at the two ends of the wire ( light blue ) are weakly coupled , so their energy is not exactly zero and we need a way to distinguish them from an ordinary fermionic excitation ( dark blue ) . to that end",
    "we close the wire into a ring through a topologically trivial superconductor and ask whether destructive interference of the tunnel splitting in the two arms of the ring can produce a pair of two - fold degenerate zero - energy states . ]",
    "this distinction between weak and strong coupling can be made operational by means of the thought experiment illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_ring ] : we close the wire into a ring by connecting the two ends through a superconductor which is in a topologically trivial phase ( with a uniform positive gap @xmath155 ) .",
    "destructive interference in the two arms of the ring can eliminate the tunnel splitting between a pair of majorana bound states and produce two - fold degenerate zero - energy eigenstates , if the coupling between the two majorana s through each arm of the ring is of comparable strength .",
    "so we vary @xmath155 ( allowing also for mode mixing at the junction between the two arms of the ring ) and find that a number @xmath2 of two - fold degenerate states appear at zero energy .",
    "this means that the disordered wire contains @xmath2 pairs of majorana s which are more strongly coupled to the ends of the wire than to each other ( otherwise the couplings through the two arms of the ring could not have been equalized by varying @xmath155 ) .",
    "the number @xmath2 thus counts the number of weakly coupled majorana bound states , which gives the topological quantum number @xmath1 .      now that we have an operational definition of the topological quantum number of a finite system , our next step is to relate this to the scattering parameters @xmath36 in eq .  .",
    "for this purpose it is easiest to work with the transfer matrix , rather than the scattering matrix .",
    "an eigenstate @xmath50 of the ring must be single - valued as we go around the ring , so in terms of the transfer matrices @xmath40 and @xmath156 of the two arms of the ring we have the condition @xmath157 .",
    "this leads to the determinantal condition @xmath158    we choose to work in a basis where the orthogonal matrices @xmath159 in eq .",
    "are equal to the unit matrix .",
    "each of the @xmath160 eigenchannels of the disordered wire can then be treated separately , with @xmath161 transfer matrices @xmath162 at zero energy .",
    "the topologically trivial arm of the ring ( of length @xmath163 and coherence length @xmath164 , without any disorder ) has transfer matrix @xmath165 .",
    "the condition for an eigenstate at zero energy reads @xmath166 which has a twofold degenerate solution if the ratio @xmath167 is tuned to the value @xmath168 .",
    "this is the pair of weakly coupled majorana bound states in the @xmath169-th eigenchannel that we are searching for . because @xmath170 , by definition in a topologically trivial phase , the pair exists only if @xmath171 .",
    "we conclude that the number of pairs @xmath2 of weakly coupled majorana bound states equals the number of negative @xmath36 s , hence @xmath172 as announced in eq .  .",
