    "the past few years have been a period of tremendous progress in detection of distant clusters .",
    "as recently as five years ago no single survey contained more than ten cluster candidates at @xmath0@xmath10.5 , but a series of efforts have since led to a several order of magnitude increase in the number of known high - redshift systems ( postman et al .",

    "the recently completed las campanas distant cluster survey ( lcdcs ) is our contribution to this field .",
    "clusters in the lcdcs are detected as regions of excess optical surface brightness relative to the background sky , a technique that permits detection of clusters to @xmath0@xmath20.9 with shallow , drift - scan imaging .",
    "the resulting statistical catalog consists of 1073 cluster candidates at @xmath0@xmath40.3 . to enable efficient use of these catalogs we use follow - up imaging and spectroscopy to characterize the properties of the sample , including the contamination rate as well as estimates of the redshifts and relative velocity dispersions of the candidates ( see gonzalez et al .",
    "2001@xmath5 for details ) .    one application of this sample is determination of the cluster correlation function ( gonzalez et al",
    ". 2001@xmath6 ) . for roughly dispersion - limited subsamples at @xmath0@xmath20.5",
    "the observed angular correlation functions are well fit by the power law @xmath7 with @xmath8 . using the angular correlation data",
    ", we derive the spatial correlation length ( @xmath9 ) as a function of mean intracluster separation ( @xmath10 ) via the cosmological limber inversion .",
    "we find correlation lengths for the lcdcs that are similar to those observed for local catalogs , and observe a dependence of @xmath9 upon @xmath10 that is comparable to the results of croft et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the apm catalog .",
    "these results are consistent with theoretical expectations , which predict only modest evolution in the clustering amplitude since @xmath0=0.5 .",
    "several programs are also being conducted with lcdcs clusters to study the evolution of cluster galaxies .",

    "meanwhile , the ediscs collaboration is conducting a deep multicolor imaging and spectroscopic survey of 20 of the most massive lcdcs candidates at @xmath0=0.5 and @xmath0=0.8 , with the aim of constraining cluster galaxy morphologies , scaling relations , cluster dynamics , and the evolution of cluster galaxies at these epochs .",
