    "the behavior of high temperature superconductors ( hts ) is characterized by a strong dependence on doping .",
    "for example , changing the sr concentration in la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 , or the o concentration in yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath12 tunes these materials from antiferromagnetic insulators , to spin glasses , and finally to superconductors .",
    "the short coherence length and relatively low superfluid density in the underdoped region emphasize the existence of phase fluctuations and enhance the competition between superconductivity and other long range order phases @xcite . in such systems , where different ground states emerge as the particle density is tuned , it is often important to explore the possibility inhomogeneous mixtures of phases ; for example , antiferromagnetic and superconducting , at commensurate and incommensurate filling .",
    "indeed , there has already been considerable study of whether the doped holes are uniformly distributed or whether they accumulate preferentially in two - dimensional phase separated regions@xcite or in one - dimensional stripes@xcite .",
    "there have been many direct studies of doping dependent transitions in correlated electron hamiltonians like the repulsive hubbard model , which provide microscopic models of hts@xcite .",
    "these are numerically challenging since they attempt to understand the origin of hts at the same time as addressing additional subtle issues like inhomogeneous phases .",
    "a more simple , if somewhat less fundamental , way in which related questions can be addressed is to consider models , like the @xmath13 hubbard hamiltonian , which have an attractive interaction ` built in ' .",
    "this separates out the problem of how superconducting pairs form in disordered , short coherence length systems in which the particle density is fixed but the interactions are diluted , from the complexities of the origins of the attractive interaction .",
    "the key underlying question is how superconductivity spreads through a system as the local attraction between charge carriers is strengthened .",
    "indeed , such centers of attraction played important role in the several models of hts@xcite .",
    "another possible experimental realization is the percolative , granular - like transition to superconductivity via hydrogen doping which has been reported in eu@xmath14ce@xmath15nbsr@xmath16cu@xmath16o@xmath17@xcite , a ceramic with the superconducting critical temperature @xmath18= 29 k.    in this paper , we shall adopt this approach and study a simple model which allows us to address the issue of superconducting transitions tuned by changing the concentration of attraction centers .",
    "specifically , we study a two - dimensional negative @xmath0 hubbard model which has an on - site attraction on some fraction of its lattice sites and ask what fraction of sites is needed to be attractive for the system to superconduct . recently , this issue has been addressed by litak and gyrffy @xcite who examined the problem of superconducting percolation by using hartree - fock - gorkov decoupling as an approximation for interacting electrons and coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to treat randomly distributed centers .",
    "they have found the critical concentration of negative centers @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes a band filling in the limit of large @xmath21 interaction . for a small concentration of centers @xmath22",
    "the system becomes normal because every site , where @xmath2 interaction is present , is doubly occupied .",
    "the effect of dilution of the interactions in the attractive @xmath0 hubbard model at half - filling , @xmath23 can also be inferred from the quantum monte carlo work of ulmke _",
    "et al._@xcite , who investigated the suppression of antiferromagnetism by @xmath24 impurities in the repulsive hubbard model ( @xmath25 ) at @xmath23 .",
    "the critical concentration @xmath26 of impurities which destroy the antiferromagnetism was estimated as @xmath27 .",
    "since a particle - hole transformation maps the attractive and repulsive @xmath0 hubbard models onto one another , at half - filling , this work immediately identifies the critical concentration @xmath6 for suppression of superconductivity in the attractive hubbard model , @xmath28 .",
    "further analytic work on the disordered attractive hubbard model , for example based on numerical solution of the bogliubov - de gennes equations , is contained in @xcite",
    ". however , there have to date been no quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) studies for the doped case where the density is not precisely half - filled and particle - hole symmetry is broken . in this paper",
    "we examine the problem of percolating superconductivity using qmc in the negative @xmath0 hamiltonian changing the concentration of negative centers @xmath3 as well as band filling @xmath20@xcite .",
    "the use of qmc enables us to go beyond the limitations of mean field approximations and investigate the effect of charge and pairing potential fluctuations on an equal footing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after an introduction in sec .  1 we present the microscopic model and formulate the problem ( sec .  2 ) .",
    "section 3 defines the qmc monte carlo method used in simulations and shows the key numerical results : the prediction of superconductivity percolation and the critical concentration @xmath6 .",
    "the paper ends with conclusions .",
    "we consider the random negative @xmath0 hubbard model @xcite defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath29 here @xmath5 and @xmath30 label sites on a two - dimensional square lattice , @xmath31 is the hopping integral connecting only nearest neighbour @xmath5 and @xmath30 s , @xmath32 is the electronic chemical potential , @xmath33 , @xmath34 create and annihilate , respectively , electrons at the single site @xmath5 with spin @xmath35 , and the coupling constant , @xmath36    we are interested in determining , away from particle - hole symmetry , the critical concentration @xmath6 for the @xmath0 centers such that for @xmath22 the configurationally averaged , superconducting long range order parameter vanishes . at the same time , we would like to obtain some insight into the mechanism of the formation of long range order as one moves to @xmath37 .",
    "such questions can be addressed by computing expectation values of operators like the hamiltonian , the kinetic energy and double occupation , and pair - pair correlation functions .",
    "such expectation values take the general form , @xmath38 and can be evaluated by a standard procedure @xcite which involves writing a path integral expression for the imaginary time evolution operator @xmath39 and performing a stochastic integration over a set of auxiliary fields introduced to treat the electron - electron interaction exactly .",
    "this will be described in greater detail in the following section . typically , we can study system of a few hundred electrons , far larger than the competing exact diagonalization approach , but still small enough to require careful treatment of finite size effects , as we shall discuss below",
    ".    we will focus especially on the equal time pair correlation function , which is defined by @xmath40 here @xmath41 creates a pair of electrons at lattice site @xmath5 .",
    "the long range order in @xmath42 can be probed by calculating its structure factor , @xmath43 a finite positive value @xmath44 , in the limit of large lattice size @xmath45 , signals superconductivity , otherwise the system is normal . for our disordered system",
    "[ e2 ] , fig .",
    "1 ) we have to do a disorder average over many realizations of random configurations of the attractive @xmath0 centers .",
    "in order to describe the quantum monte carlo method @xcite in more detail , let us first rewrite the hubbard hamiltonian in a way which puts the interaction term in a particle - hole symmetric form . @xmath46 the trace over the fermion degrees of freedom can not be performed analytically due to the quadratic interaction of term @xmath0 . to reduce the problem to a quadratic hamiltonian we discretize the imaginary time @xmath47 ( eq . [ e3 ] ) and employ the trotter approximation @xcite to decompose the full imaginary time evolution .",
    "the partition function can be expressed as , @xmath48^l \\approx   \\left [ { \\rm e}^{-\\delta \\tau \\hat k } { \\rm e}^{-\\delta \\tau \\hat p }   \\right]^l~ , \\label{e7}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 includes the quadratic part of @xmath50 ( eq . [ e6 ] ) @xmath51 while @xmath52 the on - site interaction part @xmath53",
    "then we apply the discrete hubbard  stratanovich transformation to decouple the attractive interaction @xmath54 @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56    the replacement of the quartic interaction term between up and down spin electron densities by an expression in which the densities couple to a hubbard - stratonovich field makes all terms in the exponential of eq .  7 quadratic in the fermion operators .",
    "the trace can then be performed analytically , leaving a product of determinants which depend on the hubbard - stratonovich field . because the up and down spin species couple to the field with the same sign , these two determinants are identical , and",
    "hence their product is always positive .",
    "so , unlike the case of the repulsive model where @xmath57 couples to the field , there is no sign problem in the attractive model , even in the presence of disorder in the interaction .",
    "using the above procedure we have simulated the hamiltonian ( eq . [ e6 ] ) and calculated the pair structure factor @xmath58 ( eq . [ e5 ] ) as a function of lattice size @xmath45 .",
    "spin - wave theory suggests that in the ordered phase the finite size correction for @xmath58 should be proportional to the inverse linear system size @xmath59@xcite .",
    "figure 2(a ) presents the results of finite size scaling of @xmath58 for various concentrations of @xmath0 sites @xmath3 .",
    "the calculations were done for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the average number of electrons per site was chosen to be @xmath23 .",
    "one can easily see that there exists a critical concentration @xmath62 .    to see how @xmath6 depends on @xmath20 in fig .",
    "2(b ) the concentration of @xmath0 centers is kept fixed at @xmath63 , and we have plotted @xmath58 for various system fillings ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "here @xmath23 corresponds to the case at the percolation threshold ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "it is clear that for a larger average charge @xmath67 the system is not superconducting .",
    "a different situation emerges for @xmath68 where @xmath69 appears to be slightly above 0 , that is , the system is superconducting .",
    "clearly , disorder in the interaction @xmath0 has broken the particle  hole symmetry .",
    "in fact , this is connected with the modification of the bare chemical potential at @xmath0 sites , in the quadratic part of hamiltonian @xmath49 ( eq . [ e6],[e8 ] ) @xmath70    in some previous work on the repulsive model@xcite , disorder was inserted in a way which preserved particle - hole symmetry by using a separate shift in chemical potential depending on the interaction strength on each site .",
    "this enabled simulations at lower temperature since it eliminated the sign problem , but also was somewhat less physically motivated .",
    "interestingly , the structure factor associated with the pairing correlation function @xmath71 for @xmath72 is smaller than the one for @xmath73 .",
    "this is due to the existence of a competing charge density wave ( cdw ) phase at @xmath23 .",
    "a similar effect was found for the system with disordered site energies and the same attraction @xmath0 on every lattice site @xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to phase fluctuation of the pairing potential@xcite , it is clear that the distribution of charges @xmath74 on the lattice ( charge fluctuations ) is also important for the destruction of superconductivity . indeed",
    ", previous work suggests that percolation of the occupied sites is a crucial phenomenon in this process@xcite .    examining this effect further",
    ", one can look for the change of the pairing factor correlation function @xmath58 and simultaneously the average occupation of @xmath0 sites ( @xmath75 ) ( where @xmath76 ) .",
    "figures 3a - c show these quantities as a function of average site occupation @xmath20 for a finite system @xmath77 for @xmath73 ( a ) , @xmath78 ( b ) and c=0.375 ( c ) , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath58 does not display particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the dotted lines in fig .",
    "3(a - c ) represent the occupation of attractive sites for a simplified hamiltonian , where @xmath49 reads @xmath79 it is easy to see that in case of the full hamiltonian ( eqs .",
    "[ e2],[e6 ] ) the system displays charge fluctuation ( @xmath80 ) and comparing @xmath75 curves to the dotted lines one can see that charge fluctuations are stronger for smaller @xmath3 .",
    "in our case , for large enough interaction @xmath0 , the small concentration of @xmath0 centers leads to double occupation in almost all attractive sites .",
    "this makes it harder for electrons to hop to another @xmath81 site .",
    "nevertheless the system can be metallic because the other electrons which occupy the @xmath24 site can easily hop to the other @xmath24 sites .",
    "this result is consistent with the results obtained by litak and gyrffy @xcite .",
    "the small dip visible in the pairing structure factor @xmath58 around @xmath23 ( in fig .",
    "3a ) can be associated with the creation of a cdw order .",
    "this effect is not present in figs .",
    "3b - c as cdw expected to disappear faster than superconductivity @xcite .",
    "we have examined the problem of percolating superconductivity in the context of a random @xmath0 hubbard model .",
    "we have studied the case where @xmath1 is @xmath2 and 0 with probability @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively by the quantum monte carlo method . for the half  filled system @xmath23 we obtain the critical concentration @xmath82 . as we expected",
    "the transition is due to phase and charge fluctuations and depends strongly on the density @xmath20 . in that sense",
    "our results agree qualitatively with those obtained by litak and gyrffy@xcite .",
    "moreover , the present approach is exact as opposed to earlier work@xcite employing the mean field approximation .",
    "we find that the onset of superconductivity in this diluted , attractive hubbard model is linked to percolation of the order parameter and charge fluctuations .",
