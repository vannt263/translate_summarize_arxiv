    "nearby galaxies can provide many important clues for us to understand the star formation history , evolution process and relation between them and the milky way ( mw ) . in the past decade , the accurate abundance of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) has allowed a detailed study of their star formation and chemical evolution histories @xcite . some important chemical signatures , such as the lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , have been studied .",
    "@xcite found that the galactic winds can remove a large fraction of gas and the elements produced by massive stars , which would reduce the enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the low abundance ratios could be due to a low star formation rate . based on the study of chemical evolution of dsphs",
    ", @xcite found that the low [ @xmath0/fe ] could be explained quantitatively by a sudden decrease of star formation . because of",
    "relatively shallow potential wells for dwarf galaxies , the strong galactic winds can remove a large fraction of the gas and , consequently , the star formation rate drops to a very low value . in this case , the enrichment of @xmath0 elements by massive stars is almost halted and sne ia are left to contribute their production , such as iron group elements , due to longer lifetime . as a result , when the galactic winds occur , the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios decrease @xcite .    using the high resolution spectroscopy",
    ", @xcite analyzed the elemental abundances of the red giant branch stars in the central region of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( fornax dsph ) .",
    "this analysis shows the lower ratios of [ @xmath0/fe ] , [ ni / fe ] and [ cr / fe ] compared with those in the mw stars . in contrast , the abundance of some neutron - capture elements , such as ba and la , are enhanced .",
    "they found that their sample stars have unusually abundance patterns and that the fornax dsph is a chemically complex system .",
    "the fornax dsph is one of the dwarf spheroidal companions to the milky way .",
    "it is a luminous dwarf galaxy with a luminosity of @xmath2= @xmath3 @xcite and the second most massive dwarf galaxy satellites of our galaxy with a total ( dynamical ) mass in the range @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it shows a wider range of metallicity and multiple populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed abundances of individual stars could provide an excellent opportunity to study the star formation history and complicated chemical evolution history of the fornax dsph .",
    "recently , @xcite studied abundance trends in fornax dsph and concluded that a different form of the initial mass function ( imf ) is needed .",
    "he found that the lack of very massive stars ( m@xmath5 ) may explain the low [ @xmath0/fe ] observed in the fornax dsph . on the other hand , based on the analysis of the colour - magnitude diagrams and the spectroscopic metallicity distributions of individual red giant branch stars , @xcite studied the star formation history of the fornax dsph .",
    "they found that although the fornax dsph is dominated by intermediate age ( 1 - 10 gyr ) stellar populations , the star formation is clearly present at all ages , from 14 gyr to 0.25 gyr .",
    "this implies that the galactic wind effect is not intense enough to halt the star formation in the fornax dsph .",
    "elements heavier than iron are mainly synthesized by neutron - capture process in two ways : one is the slow neutron - capture process ( the s - process ) and the other is the rapid neutron - capture process ( the r - process ) @xcite . the s - process is divided into the weak s - component and the main s - component .",
    "the weak s - process occurs in the massive stars ( @xmath6 ) undergoing core he burring and shell c burring @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the main s - process elements are produced in the low- to intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath71.5@xmath88@xmath9 ) during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase @xcite .",
    "type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) are usually considered to be the candidates in which the r - process nucleosynthesis occurs @xcite .",
    "because of the large eu overabundance ( [ eu / fe]@xmath101.6 ) , two metal - poor stars cs 22892 - 052 and cs 31082 - 001 arose extensive attention .",
    "these two stars are called as",
    " main r - process stars \" , because their abundance patterns of the heavier neutron - capture elements match the solar - system r - process pattern well ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , their lighter neutron - capture elements are too deficient to fit the solar - system s r - process pattern .",
    "this implies that another process , which is referred to the  lighter element primary process \" @xcite or  weak r - process \" @xcite , is needed .",
    "the abundance patterns of weak r - process stars , hd 122563 and hd 88609 , show an excess of lighter neutron - capture elements and a deficiency of heavier neutron - capture elements @xcite .",
    "observational abundances of metal - poor stars in the mw show that the heavier neutron - capture elements and light elements are not produced in the same sites @xcite .",
    "this implies that the main r - process should occur in o - ne - mg core - collapse sne ii with progenitors of 8 - 10@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the weak r - process elements are coupled with the light elements and iron group elements @xcite . the primary light elements and iron group elements ( i.e.",
    ", the yields independent of initial metallicity approximately ) are produced in massive stars with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the abundance of metal - poor stars and found that the weak r - process abundance pattern is uniform and unique .",
    "based on the observed abundances of weak r - process stars and the main r - process stars , @xcite derived the abundances of weak r - process and main r - process using an iterative method and extended  the weak r - process component \" to primary light elements and primary iron group elements .",
    "they found that the abundances in all metal - poor stars contain the contributions from the two r - processes .    because stars of different mass contribute different elements to the dsph on different timescales , the abundances of individual stars contain the contributions from various astrophysical processes and are the integrated results over the lifetime of the system since the stars were born . in order to reveal the complicated star formation history and evolution process of fornax dsph ,",
    "it is important to analyze the elemental abundances in detail , including @xmath0 elements , iron group elements and neutron - capture elements .",
    "these reasons inspired us to study the abundance of the dsph stars . in this case , the quantitative decomposing stellar elemental abundances of the contributions from various astrophysical processes are significant . in this paper , we study the astrophysical origins that reproduc the abundance pattern of 56 stars in the fornax dsph , in which the @xmath0 elements , iron group elements , lighter neutron - capture elements and heavier neutron - capture elements have been observed , and we analyze the relative contributions from the individual processes .",
    "the five - component abundance approach is described in section 2 . in section 3 , the analysis of calculated results are presented .",
    "section 4 is our conclusions .",
    "several previous studies on the abundances of neutron - capture elements have indicated that for most stars , the observed abundances of the heavy elements can not be matched by only one neutron - capture process @xcite .",
    "one of our major goals is to explore the astrophysical origin of elements , including light elements , iron group elements and neutron - capture elements , in the stars of the fornax dsph by comparing the observed abundances with the predicted contributions of various astrophysical processes .",
    "the ith element abundance can be calculated as    @xmath13)=(c_{r , m}n_{i , r , m}+c_{pri}n_{i , pri}+c_{s , m}n_{i , s , m}+c_{sec}n_{i , sec}+c_{ia}n_{i , ia})\\times10^{[fe / h]}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the abundances of the ith element produced by the main r - process , the primary process in massive stars , the main s - process , the secondary process in massive stars , and sne ia , respectively , which have been normalized to abundances of the solar system ; the component coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the relative contributions from the main r - process , the primary process , the main s - process , the secondary process and sne ia , respectively . using the five component coefficients , we can determine the relative contributions of each process to the elemental abundances and then compare them with the corresponding component coefficients of the solar system ( or [ fe / h]=0 ) in which @xmath19=@xmath20=@xmath21=@xmath22=@xmath23=1 . however , these component coefficients are not usually expected to be equal to each other . for example",

    "observational abundances of metal - poor stars in the mw show that the weak r - process elements are coupled with the primary light elements and iron group elements @xcite .",
    "massive stars ( m@xmath24 ) are the astrophysical origins of the primary elements , including the primary light elements , iron group elements and weak r - process elements , and provide significant contributions to the solar abundances for these elements .",
    "note that the mass range of progenitors in which the light elements and iron group elements were produced should be different from the progenitor mass range of sne ii in which the weak r - process elements were produced .",
    "the sites of weak r - process should be the fe - core - collapse sne ii with progenitors of mainly about 11 - 25@xmath11 @xcite from which the primary light elements and iron group elements are also ejected .",
    "however , more massive stars ( m@xmath5 ) can also produce the primary light elements and iron group elements @xcite .",
    "in this case , the contributions from the more massive stars should have existed in the observational abundances of the metal - poor stars and are difficult to separated out . because the contributions from the more massive stars , which have shorter lifetime , are always present at various times , the light elements and iron group elements in  the weak r - process component \" derived from the weak r - process stars , hd 122563 and hd 88609 , should contain the contributions from the more massive stars . in this work , the weak r - process component derived by @xcite",
    "is called the  primary component \" , since the associated light elements , iron group elements and the weak r - process elements are produced in massive stars as primary yields .",
    "note that the best - fitted results of the metal - poor stars with metallicity range -3.0@xmath25[fe / h]@xmath25 - 2.0 for the light elements and iron group elements by @xcite imply that a more complete analysis using the abundances of more metal - poor stars would likely offer only minor corrections to the abundances pattern of the primary component .",
    "the abundances of main r - process @xmath14 are adopted from @xcite .    due to the secondary - like nature of major neutron source @xmath26 ,",
    "the contributions from weak s - process are negligible for metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "the abundances of weak s - process are taken from @xcite at [ fe / h]=0",
    ". the ratios of [ @xmath0/fe ] observed for the mw stars show a plateau at [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 1 , which means that the @xmath0 elements are produced mainly by the primary - like mechanisms .",
    "based on nucleosynthesis calculations , @xcite found that the effect of metallicity on the production of @xmath0 elements in massive stars is mild .",
    "however , the observed increase in some odd - z elements and iron group elements toward high [ fe / h ] is the effect of metallicity on nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "nucleosynthesis calculations for massive stars show that the yields of some odd - z elements ( e.g. , na and al ) and iron group elements ( e.g. , mn ) increased with increasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical sites of , and dominant contributing processes to , some iron group elements still have not been reliably established .",
    "@xcite found that the abundance of iron group element cu in the mw contains the contributions from the primary process and secondary process ( i.e. , the yields which increase with increasing initial metallicity ) in massive stars . according to estimate of @xcite , the contributed fraction from the secondary process in massive stars for cu",
    "is reached about 25% for the solar system . @xcite",
    "have found that for disk stars , although the iron group elements are mostly synthesized by sne ia , the secondary - like contributions from the massive stars are non - negligible .",
    "@xcite found that , for light elements and iron group elements , the abundances in the solar system are higher than the sum of contributions from primary component and sne ia , because the contributions from secondary - like yields produced in the massive stars are not included . in this work ,",
    "we obtain the secondary - like abundances for the light elements and iron group elements by subtracting the sum of the contributions of primary - like yields ( adopted from @xcite ) , sne ia ( adopted from @xcite ) and main s - process component ( adopted from @xcite ) from the solar system abundances ( adopted from @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure ensures that the sum of the abundances of four components is not overproduced with respect to solar . because the weak s - process elements are also produced in massive stars and have a secondary nature , the secondary - like abundances of light elements and iron group elements should be tightly related to the weak s - process abundances .",
    "the secondary light elements , iron group elements and the weak s - process elements are produced in the massive stars ( m@xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the mass range of the stars in which the light elements and iron group elements were produced should be different from those of the stars in which the weak s - process elements were produced .",
    "the sites of the weak s - process ( and the part of secondary - like yields for the light elements and iron group elements ) are mainly the massive stars with @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "however , the more massive stars ( m@xmath28 ) can also produce the secondary light elements and iron group elements .",
    "the contributions from the more massive stars are difficult to distinguish in the observed abundances of the sample stars , because the timescale is long enough to permit all massive stars to eject their productions for higher metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath29 - 2.0 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that the weak s - process also occurs in star with 70@xmath11 .",
    "this would mean that the mass range of stars in which the weak s - process occurs may be similar to those of stars in which the secondary light elements and iron group elements were produced .",
    "based on the discussions above , we combined the secondary - like abundances for the light elements and iron - group elements with weak s - process abundances as  the secondary component \" . the secondary component",
    "@xmath17 contains the abundances of the light elements , iron group elements and the weak s - process elements .",
    "based on the observations , @xcite found that compare to the mw , the ratios of [ ba / fe ] and [ y / fe ] in the dsph show larger dispersions and [ ba / y ] are exceedingly high .",
    "this means that the ism in the dsph is chemical inhomogeneous and the abundance pattern of s - process elements of a newly - formed star was polluted by the winds of low - mass agb stars with low - metallicity in the vicinity . in this case",
    ", the s - process nucleosynthesis favors heavier nuclei over lighter ones , since more neutrons can be captured by an iron seed nucleus @xcite . obviously , there are some differences in the chemical evolution characteristics between the dsph and the mw , which lead to the different s - process abundance patterns between the dsph and the milky way .",
    "so , the s - process abundance patterns of the mw are not adequate to used in the dsph stars . considering the wide range of metallicity of the sample stars ( -1.4@xmath1[fe / h]@xmath1 - 0.5 ) in dsph , the abundance pattern of @xmath16 in equation ( 1 ) is calculated as the mixing of the main s - process abundance produced by low - mass agb stars with [ fe / h]=-1.0 and [ fe / h]=-0.6 , which are given by @xcite .",

    "the adopted metallicity - dependent abundance pattern @xmath16 in equation ( 1 ) is taken from the main s - process abundance given by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "12 ) and @xcite ( see their fig . 3-fig .",
    "6 ) , which included the contributions of low- to intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath34 ) and also has been normalized to the main s - process abundance of ba in solar system .    in equation ( 1 )",

    "using component coefficients , we can determine the relative contributions of each individual process to the stellar abundances .",
    "moreover , we can compare the derived component coefficients with the corresponding coefficients of the solar system in which all of them are equal to 1 .",
    "for the sample stars , the five component coefficients are not equal to each other , because their elemental abundances are not in solar proportions .",

    "@xcite have found that [ eu / fe ] of dsph stars are at the same levels observed in the mw stars for the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "our calculated results about main r - process component coefficients are consistent with their findings .",
    "the apparent rise of [ la / fe ] or [ ba / fe ] observed in fornax dsph or sagittarius dsph is due to pollution by agb stellar wind .",
    "the calculated results presented by @xcite show that [ la / fe ] ( or [ ba / fe ] ) decrease slightly at high metallicities , which is due to the effects of galactic winds on the star formation rate .",
    "this means that there is a discrepancy between predictions of the chemical evolution model and observations .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have found that an increase in the yields of la in agb stars by a factor that is smaller than four is not enough to match the observed ratios .",
    "however , they reported that if the s - process yields of the agb stars were increased considerably , the yields could not be used in the mw and the solar system correctly .",
    "obviously , there is other reason to explain the rise of [ ba / fe ] or [ la / fe ] observed in the dsphs .",
    "historically , variations in the imf have been proposed to reduce the chemical enrichment from massive stars @xcite .",
    "the truncated imf has been used as a possible cause of lowering [ @xmath0/fe ] in dwarfs @xcite . because the s - process yields should mainly be dependent on the initial mass and metallicity of the low mass agb stars , the average yields of the agb stars with the same initial mass and metallicity as the dsph should be similar to those of the mw . in this case , the rise of [ ba / fe ] or [ la / fe ] observed in the dsphs should be attributed to contributions from the larger number of agb stars .",
    "so , the abundances of s - process elements , ba and la , in the dsph can be used to constrain the number of agb stars that have polluted the gas in which the star formed and , thus constrain the imf .",
    "it is interesting to note that , based on our calculation , the ratio of the average main s - process coefficient between the fornax dsph and the mw is about 5.5 , which is close to the increased factor of the agb yields reported by @xcite .",
    "our calculated results mean that the reason for the rise of [ ba / fe ] or [ la / fe ] observed in the dsphs is the bottom - heavy imf , which favors a larger number of low - mass agb stars .",
    "in dsphs , nearly all chemical evolution and nucleosynthetic information is in the elemental abundances of stars with various metallicities . in this work , we investigate the astrophysical origins of the observed abundances of fornax dsph stars and derive the relative contributions from the individual astrophysical process .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    \\1 . adopting the five - component approach ,",
    "the abundances of most sample stars , including @xmath0 elements , iron group elements , lighter and heavier neutron - capture elements , can be fitted .",
    "the component coefficients of the main r - process , main s - process and secondary process of most dsph stars are different from those of the solar system",
    ". however , the component coefficients of primary process and sne ia are close to those of the solar system .",
    "the component coefficients of the main s - process , secondary process , primary process and sne ia of the dsph stars are obviously different from those of mw stars with similar range of metallicity .",
    "the component coefficients of main r - process , main s - process and sne ia of most dsph stars are larger than those of the mw stars .",
    "this means that the contributions from main r - process , main s - process and sne ia to the dsph stars are larger than those to the mw stars",
    ". however , there are the trends for the dsph stars with smaller @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that for the dsph stars , the contributions from primary process and secondary process are smaller than the corresponding contribution for the mw stars .",
    "the detailed abundance trends of five components for fornax dsph could provide the information on the chemical enrichment history . we find that the contribution from massive stars as the primary yields of @xmath0 elements and iron group elements increases monotonously with increasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "this means that the star formed , including massive stars , at all ages and the contributions from the massive stars to @xmath0 elements did not halted , at least until [ fe / h ] reached -0.5 .",
    "these correlations provide the significant evidence that the effect of the galactic wind is not strong enough to halt the star formation in fornax for [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 0.5 .",
    "the ratios of average component coefficient between the dsph stars and the mw stars monotonously decrease with the increasing progenitor mass .",
    "the correlation is significant evidence of the bottom - heavy imf for the fonax dsph , compared to the milky way .    \\5 .",
    "although fornax dsph stars have a range of metallicity similar to the mw sample stars , the contribution proportions for fe from various astrophysical processes of fornax dsph stars are different with those of the mw stars .",
    "for the mw stars the contributions of the primary - like yields to fe are larger than those of sne ia and the secondary - like yields .",
    "however , the fe abundances in the dsph stars predominantly come from sne ia .",
    "this means that the contributions from the massive stars to the dsph are smaller than corresponding contributions to the mw , which is consistent with the bottom - heavy imf for the dsph .",
    "although mg abundances predominantly come from the contributions of the primary process for both the mw stars and the fornax dsph stars , the ratios of the primary process of the dsph stars are close to that of the solar system and lower than those of the mw stars .",
    "this suggests that the contributions of the primary - like yields produced in the massive stars to the dsph are smaller than the corresponding contributions to the mw . after considering the bottom - heavy imf for the dsph , the lower [ @xmath0/fe ] observed in the dsph stars",
    "can be explained .",
    "\\7 . for the mw stars ,",
    "the abundances of the iron group element ni mainly come from the primary process and secondary process .",
    "however , for the dsph stars , the component ratios of sne ia for ni are larger than those of the primary process and the secondary process .",
    "although the component ratios of sne ia has reached the solar system ratio , the component ratios of the primary process and the secondary process for the dsph are smaller than corresponding ratios of the mw .",
    "these are the reasons for observed [ ni / fe]@xmath250 for fornax dsph stars and are consistent with the bottom - heavy imf .",
    "\\8 . for the mw stars ,",
    "the abundances of lighter neutron - capture element y mainly come from the weak r - process and main s - process . on the other hand , for most dsph stars",
    ", the contributions from the main s - process exceed the contributions from main r - process and weak r - process . the contributions from weak s - process can be negligible at all metallicities .",
    "although the average value of [ y / fe ] for dsph stars is close to that of the mw stars , the contributed proportions of the main s - process , main r - process and weak r - process are obviously different with those of the mw stars .    \\9 . because there are some differences in the s - process abundance characteristics between the dsph and the mw , the s - process abundance patterns of the mw are not adequate to used in the dsph stars . by adopting the mixing of the main s - process abundance produced by low - mass agb stars with [ fe / h]=-1.0 and [ fe / h]=-0.6 presented by @xcite , the abundances of the s - process elements , ba and y , can be fitted .",
    "the fitted results mean that the s - process elements in the dsph predominantly come from the low - mass agb stars , which is consistent with the suggestion of the bottom - heavy imf for the fornax dsph .",
    "\\10 . for the mw stars ,",
    "the abundances of the heavier neutron - capture element ba mainly come from the contributions of the main r - process and main s - process . on the other hand , for the most dsph stars ,",
    "contributions from the main s - process to ba exceed contributions from the main r - process for [ fe / h]@xmath52 - 1.0 and begin to drive [ ba / h ] upward to [ ba / h]=0 . the rise of [ ba / fe ] or [ la / fe ] observed in fornax dsph can be attributed to contributions from the larger number of agb stars .",
    "it is a natural result that the contributions of main s - process produced in the low - mass agb stars to the dsph are larger than corresponding contributions to the milky way due to the bottom - heavy imf of the dsph .",
    "our abundance approach is based on the abundance patterns of the main r - process , main s - process , sne ia , primary process and secondary process to decompose stellar elemental abundances , rather than the traditional galactic chemical evolution model which integrates stellar yields beginning from early galaxies .",
    "this procedure allows us to use available elemental abundances to investigate their astrophysical origins and chemical evolution when each contribution is showed as a function of metallicity .",
    "we hope that the results here will provide a useful guide for more complete chemical evolution models of fonax dsph .",
    "obviously , a more precise knowledge about the elemental abundances in the dsph stars is needed .",
