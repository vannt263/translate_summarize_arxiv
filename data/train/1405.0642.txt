    "we can observe various types of pattern phenomena in nature . in order to understand the pattern formation mechanisms of such phenomena ,",
    "mathematical models have been proposed and analyzed from the viewpoint of both numerical and theoretical studies . among these models ,",
    "reaction - diffusion systems have attracted many researchers @xcite .",
    "though the systems which describe a local interaction and a long - range dispersal between chemical substances or biological species are rather simple , turing stated that spatially inhomogeneous structures can be formed in a self - organized way under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "since then , a lot of studies on the reaction - diffusion systems have been reported .",
    "turing considered the following system of partial differential equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 indicate concentrations of chemical substances or population densities of biological species at time @xmath3 at position @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 mean respectively diffusion coefficients of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 express a local interaction between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , turing gave the following assumption on the reaction system of ordinary differential equations without diffusion terms @xmath11    the system possesses an equilibrium point @xmath12 and it is asymptotically stable .    in this framework , turing derived a paradox that the equilibrium solution @xmath12 in with suitable boundary conditions can be destabilized in spite of adding the diffusion terms which possess a smoothing effect of spatial heterogeneity even though the equilibrium point @xmath12 is stable in the sense of .",
    "this is well known as the diffusion - induced instability or the turing instability . as a consequence of the turing instability , exhibits spatially inhomogeneous structures called turing patterns .",
    "therefore , the turing instability is regarded as important for the onset of pattern formation on the reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "however , since is a system describing a local interaction and a dispersal between @xmath7 and @xmath8 on continuous media , it can not represent an interaction on a spatially discrete environment , such as dynamics of metapopulation , cellular networks of biological morphogenesis and networks of diffusively coupled chemical reactors .",
    "therefore , in order to treat such situations , studies on reaction - diffusion models defined on networks have proceeded @xcite .",
    "so far , the turing instability arising in reaction - diffusion models defined on networks with a small number of vertices has been investigated @xcite .",
    "recently , studies on turing patterns formed on complex networks with a large number of vertices have proceeded @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the differences between the classical turing patterns on continuous media and network organized turing patterns , and properties on turing patterns on complex networks have been shown by numerical simulations , a theory of mean field approximation , and analytical techniques .",
    "the authors in @xcite also discussed the turing instability on networks with a large number of vertices in a somewhat general framework , which the turing patterns are based on .",
    "( for example , see the methods section in @xcite . )",
    "however , they do not mention the influence of network topology on the turing instability . in other words",
    ", it is not clear whether the turing instability on a complex network occurs or not when the network topology changes . in this study , considering reaction - diffsuion models on complex networks with a large number of vertices , we investigate a relation between the turing instability and network topology with a large number of vertices in detail by using the linear stability analysis .",
    "in particular , our interest is how network topology influences the turing instability .",
    "therefore , we focus on three types of models which generate typical networks , i.e. the erds - rnyi , the watts - strogatz , and the threshold network models .",
    "we emphasize that the turing instability is an important concept as the onset of self - organized pattern formation .",
    "however , thorough studies focusing on the turing instability in reaction - diffusion models on complex networks with many vertices are very few . potential applications of reaction - diffusion models on networks were introduced in @xcite .",
    "if we regard vertices as cells , the model describes cellular networks of early biological morphogenesis .",
    "when vertices are regarded as patchy habitats , it is a model describing population dynamics with an interaction on a patchy environment ( ecological metapopulation ) . in order to understand self - organized phenomena with the network architecture , a theoretical approach using models defined on networks could be needed .",
    "as a first step , we discuss the turing instability on complex networks in this paper .    this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we formulate reaction - diffusion models defined on complex networks , which we discuss in this paper .",
    "sections [ networks generated by erdos - renyi model ] , [ networks generated by watts - strogatz model ] , and [ networks generated by threshold model ] are devoted to computer - aided analysis of the turing instability in reaction - diffusion models on networks generated by the erds - rnyi , the watts - strogatz , and the threshold network models , respectively .",
    "we reveal that these analyses derive different results on the turing instability of a homogeneous steady state , depending on network topology . in section [ theoretical results ] , we give theoretical results on the instability when the number of vertices is large enough .",
    "we complete this paper in section [ concluding remarks ] , where concluding remarks and future works are listed .",
    "as an analogy of the reaction - diffusion model on continuous media , we formulate a model on a graph with @xmath13 vertices . when there is no connection between any vertices , the dynamics on each vertex is described by a local interaction only as follows : @xmath14 where a pair @xmath15 denotes some quantities on the @xmath16th vertex , such as population densities of biological species or concentrations of chemical substances .",
    "note that the interaction functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the same on each vertex . as well as the turing instability on continuous media",
    ", we assume the existence of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point @xmath19 @xmath20 for .",
    "the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point means that @xmath21 from information of the linearized system of around @xmath19 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "next , when connection between vertices is taken into account , we give an assumption on a flux of the quantities between vertices .",
    "if the @xmath16th and the @xmath26th vertices are connected by an edge , then we suppose that a flux exists between these vertices . on the other hand ,",
    "if two vertices are not connected , there is no flux between them .",
    "we assume that the flux is given by fick s law of diffusion , which means that the flux is proportional to the difference of quantities on the two vertices .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of @xmath27 and @xmath28 on the @xmath16th vertex is described as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 because we do not consider any self - loop in the present paper . moreover , since we focus on undirected graphs , the matrix @xmath32 with the elements @xmath33 is a symmetric matrix with @xmath34 . and , the positive constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 mean respectively diffusivities of these quantities between vertices . also , the number of edges connecting to the @xmath16th vertex is expressed as @xmath35 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath36 , we can rewrite the flux term as @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is kronecker s delta ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath40 with the elements @xmath41 is called laplacian matrix of the graph @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the laplacian matrix @xmath40 varies according to network topology , and eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix @xmath40 give an important information on the turing instability of a homogeneous steady state on the graph .",
    "( see the methods section in @xcite . ) here , we define a homogeneous steady state on a graph as @xmath19 for all @xmath16 in .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the stability of the homogeneous steady state . to this end",
    ", it suffices to consider the linearized system around the steady state . substituting @xmath42 into and neglecting higher order terms , we obtain the following linear reaction - diffusion model on the graph : @xmath43 where we denoted @xmath44 by @xmath45 again .",
    "we call a reaction - diffusion model on a graph in this paper .",
    "one can write as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "obviously , we know that possesses the homogeneous steady state @xmath49 , and we study the stability of the steady state . here , we note that when we impose the condition on the parameters and @xmath50 , @xmath49 is stable .",
    "therefore , we are interested to know how the stability of @xmath49 changes according to network topology and the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this paper , we use the following parameter values @xmath51 in all numerics , which satisfies the condition . in order to specify the laplacian matrix @xmath40 in ,",
    "different types of models are proposed .",
    "below , we investigate a relation between the turing instability and network topology which is generated by the various models .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath54 be eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath40 and the associated eigenvectors to them , i.e. @xmath55 @xmath54 . since is linear , we can express the solution as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath60 therefore , in order to check the stability of @xmath49 , the real part of @xmath58 is important .",
    "if the real parts of all eigenvalues @xmath58 @xmath54 are negative , then the homogeneous steady state @xmath49 is stable because @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "if real part of at least one eigenvalue @xmath63 is positive , we have @xmath64 as @xmath62 , so the steady state @xmath49 is unstable . as a result , we find out the stability of the steady state @xmath49 by investigating the sign of real part of the eigenvalues @xmath58 . to do this , we introduce some properties of eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of a graph .",
    "assume that eigenvalues are sorted in ascending order , namely @xmath65 .",
    "the number of eigenvalues ( with multiplicity ) is @xmath13 , which is the same as the number of vertices , and all the eigenvalues are real and non - negative .",
    "since we deal with only connected graphs in the present paper , the smallest eigenvalue @xmath66 is zero , which is simple , and the second smallest eigenvalue @xmath67 is greater than zero . from linear algebra , we know that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the total number of edges .",
    "therefore , the largest eigenvalue is roughly estimated by @xmath70 .    under the condition",
    ", we discuss the sign of eigenvalues @xmath58 @xmath20 . from simple calculation ,",
    "if both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are negative , all the eigenvalues @xmath58 @xmath54 are negative , so that the instability of the homogeneous steady state does not occur . in order to yield the instability , either case @xmath73 or",
    "@xmath74 is necessary . without loss of generality , we here assume the case @xmath75 for each @xmath16 , the bifurcation curve where an eigenvalue @xmath58 takes zero is given on @xmath76 plane as follows : @xmath77 where @xmath52 is the @xmath16th eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix of a graph .",
    "when we view @xmath6 as the function of @xmath5 for each curve @xmath78 , the asymptote of the curve is @xmath79 . from information on the bifurcation curves",
    ", we can indicate the unstable region of the homogeneous steady state @xmath49 as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",

    ". that is , if @xmath52 is small , the value of the intersection point @xmath83 is large and the asymptomatic value @xmath84 is also large . on the other hand , when @xmath52 is large , both @xmath85 and @xmath84 are small .",
    "therefore , we find out that the distribution of eigenvalues plays an important role in determining stable and unstable regions on @xmath76 plane of the homogeneous steady state of .",
    "in particular , we state that small eigenvalues determine the unstable region for large @xmath76 and large eigenvalues contribute to the determination of the unstable region for small @xmath76 .",
    "after this point , the stable and unstable regions of the homogeneous steady state on @xmath76 plane is briefly called stable - unstable region .    in this paper , we consider three models which generate graphs , i.e. the erds - rnyi , the watts - strogatz , and the threshold network models .",

    "when @xmath114 , it becomes a complete graph with @xmath13 vertices since every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge .",
    "since the average degree of an erds - rnyi random graph is @xmath115 , the closer the value @xmath86 approaches one or the larger the number of vertices becomes , the more edges a graph possesses .",

    "roughly , this means that the destabilization of the homogeneous steady state @xmath49 may be inhibited because the active dispersal of substances between vertices which comes from a lot of connections smoothes the heterogeneity . actually , this expectation is fit for the numerical results in figures [ sur_er ] and [ figure4 ] .",

    "interestingly , one can see from the figures that the unstable region of the homogeneous steady state becomes narrow as the value of @xmath86 increases though the average degree is invariant .",
    "this means that the destabilization of the steady state @xmath49 of tends to be inhibited as a regular ring lattice changes into a random graph . since the networks constructed by the watts - strogatz model shortens the distance between any two vertices , that facilitates the dispersal of the quantities to all the vertices .",
    "therefore , it seems that this is related to the shift in the unstable region .",
    "moreover , the stable - unstable region for @xmath114 in figure [ sur_ws ] is quite similar to that for @xmath131 and @xmath108 in figure [ eigenvalue_er4 ] because all edges are randomly rewired to other vertices by the watts - strogatz model when @xmath114 .",

    "( see figure [ sur_tv ] . )",
    "this means that the unstable region expands as the number of edges diminishes , namely the decrease in the number of edges facilitates the destabilization of the homogeneous steady state as well as the case of the erds - rnyi model .",
    "next , we observe the transition of the stable - unstable region when the value @xmath86 is fixed and the number @xmath13 increases . for @xmath135 , the distribution of eigenvalues is @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath119 , so that an increase in the number @xmath13 shrinks the stable - unstable regions .",
    "figure [ sur_tv ] for @xmath112 and figure [ figure10 ] show that this tendency also holds for @xmath138 , that is , the region where the homogeneous steady state is destabilized with high probability gradually shrinks as to an increase in the number @xmath13 .",
    "when the value of @xmath105 is fixed and the number of vertices @xmath13 increases , the number of hubs in a network also increases .",
    "since the hubs are connected to a lot of vertices , a flux of the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 between vertices promotes the smoothing of the quantities .",
    "therefore , it seems that this is related to the occurrence of the phenomenon that the probability of the instability becomes low when the number of vertices increases . in the next section",
    ", we will theoretically refer to this phenomenon from the viewpoint of eigenvalue distribution of the laplacian matrix of a graph generated by the threshold network model when the number of vertices is large enough .",
    "in this section , we prove some theoretical results on the turing instability in a reaction - diffusion model on a graph . the first result is on the turing instability on an enhanced graph , which we can also get from the watts - strogatz model with @xmath113 in section [ networks generated by watts - strogatz model ] .",

    "the steady state becomes stable when @xmath168 . on the other hand ,",
    "the condition for @xmath169 is a little complicated . to describe it",
    ", we consider a function @xmath170 such that @xmath171 which originates from ( [ eq : sigma_c_k(l ) ] ) .",
    "then the homogeneous steady state is stable under the condition @xmath172",
    "0<d_v<-\\frac{2bc}{a^2}\\left(1+\\sqrt{1-\\frac{ad}{bc}}\\right)d_u+\\frac{d}{a } & ( \\mbox{otherwise } ) ,      \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath173 .",

    "while we have treated the enhanced cycle in the case of @xmath166 , we can also approximately compute the stability of the homogeneous steady state for the complete graph @xmath175 with @xmath13 vertices , supposing that it does not have any self - loop . if the number @xmath13 is an odd integer and @xmath176 , the enhanced cycle @xmath157 is equivalent to the complete graph @xmath175 . in the following result",

    "let @xmath183 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with a common distribution function @xmath184 . if we consider the threshold network model with the vertex weights @xmath183 and the threshold value @xmath185 , then @xmath186 is the degree of a vertex @xmath16 , where @xmath187 if @xmath188 and @xmath189 otherwise .",
    "let @xmath190 be the empirical distribution of the normalized degree sequence @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the delta function . by the definition ,",
    "the @xmath193-th moment of the empirical distribution @xmath194 is @xmath195 . using the same arguments of the proof of theorems 2 and 3 in @xcite and the induction",
    ", we can easily show that @xmath196^{m}=\\mathbb{e}\\left[\\left\\{1-f(x_{1})\\right\\}^{m}\\right]\\right)=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that the empirical distribution @xmath197 converges weakly to the distribution of the random variable @xmath198 with probability one .",
    "on the other hand , the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of the threshold network model are expressed as follows ( see theorems 2 and 3 in @xcite ) : @xmath199 for @xmath200 . combining these two observations , we obtain the empirical distribution @xmath201 converges weakly to the distribution of the random variable @xmath198 with probability one .",

    "therefore , we can expect that the ratio of the number of small eigenvalues to the total number of eigenvalues decreases as @xmath13 tends to infinity .",
    "this insight explains the reason why the probability of destabilization of the homogeneous steady state becomes low in our numerical results in figures [ sur_tv ] and [ figure10 ] as @xmath13 increases .",
    "in the present paper , we dealt with the turing instability in reaction - diffusion models defined on complex networks , and revealed that the stable - unstable regions of a homogeneous steady state differed , depending on structural properties of networks which were generated by models .",
    "we found specific properties on the turing instability on complex networks , namely the existence of a parameter region of network connectivity induced instability in the case of the erds - rnyi model , a variety of the stable - unstable regions under the equal average degree , and the decrease in the probability of destabilization of the homogeneous steady state according to an increase of @xmath13 in the threshold network model .",
    "in addition , we obtained some theoretical results , that is , the existence of the unstable region in the case of an enhanced ring and the result on the eigenvalue distribution for the threshold network model . in particular , as shown in figure [ fig : fig5.eps ] the boundary of the stable and unstable regions consists of a hyperbolic curve and a linear line .",
    "this can be explained from the numerical results on eigenvalues for @xmath113 in figure [ figure8 ] as follows : the smallest eigenvalue @xmath66 is equal to zero , and all the eigenvalues are distributed in the range @xmath134 $ ] for a positive constant @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , it appears that the largest eigenvalue @xmath129 is bounded uniformly in @xmath13 .",
    "these and the numerical results for @xmath113 in figure [ figure8 ] suggest that the infinite number of eigenvalues are continuously distributed in the range @xmath207 $ ] when @xmath13 tends to infinity , where @xmath208 . therefore , the bifurcation curve corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath209 yields the hyperbolic curve and the bifurcation curves corresponding to the other eigenvalues generates the linear line in figure [ fig : fig5.eps ] . since the turing instability is generally the onset of a self - organized pattern formation , we can expect that an inhomogeneous pattern emerges in a self - organized way in a reaction - diffusion model defined on a network .    , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 .",

    "we can observe network organized patterns as a consequence of the turing instability on a network in any cases .",
    "however , we do not have any more results on the network - organized patterns .",
    "a further investigation between turing instability discussed in the present paper and network - organized patterns is our future problem .",
    "the existence of such network - organized patterns was numerically discussed in @xcite and the authors refered to several features of network - organized pattern formation . moreover , recently , studies on a stable inhomogeneous pattern with a single differentiated node have proceeded from the viewpoint of bifurcation analysis in @xcite . as another typical solution in reaction - diffusion equations on continuous media , a traveling wave solution is well known , which moves with constant speed without changing the profile . in @xcite , wave - like phenomena were also observed in reaction - diffusion models on networks .",

    "it is not easy to understand such phenomena arising in a reaction - diffusion model on networks due to stochastic construction of a network and the large number of equations .",
    "though we dealt with three types of models , i.e. the erds - rnyi , the watts - strogatz , and the threshold network models , many models have been proposed besides the three models , for instance the barbasi - albert model .",
    "numerical and theoretical investigation of a relation between such models and the stable - unstable regions of the homogeneous steady state is a future work .",
    "a challenging problem is to treat a nonlinear system with the laplacian matrix of a graph such as . in this paper , since we focused on the turing instability of reaction - diffusion models on networks , the associated linear systems with network architecture were considered .",
    "however , in order to understand the mechanism of network - organized pattern formation , we need to analyze the nonlinear system instead of the linear system . moreover , from the viewpoint of mathematical ecology , a two patches model was proposed in @xcite , where the migration rate of each species was influenced by its own and the other one s density , that is , the model on two patches possesses the cross - diffusion - like effect which is one of the nonlinear diffusion effects .",
    "the extension of the model on two patches which locate on complex networks may contribute to the understanding of the spatially distribution of biological species on patchy environments .",
