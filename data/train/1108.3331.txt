    "exploring the mechanism for the breaking of the @xmath10 electroweak gauge symmetry is a priority in high energy physics . not only are this symmetry and its breaking  @xcite necessary components for the consistency of the successful standard model ( sm )  @xcite , but measurable properties of the breaking mechanism are also very sensitive to possible phenomena that have not yet been observed at collider experiments .",
    "measuring these properties , or setting limits on them , can constrain broad classes of extensions to the sm .",
    "a natural extension to the sm that can be tested with higgs boson search results at the fermilab tevatron collider is the addition of a fourth generation of fermions with masses much larger than those of the three known generations  @xcite .",
    "while fits to precision electroweak data favor a low - mass higgs boson in the sm , the addition of a fourth generation of fermions to the sm modifies the fit parameters such that a much heavier higgs boson is allowed  @xcite .",
    "currently available data are consistent with a higgs boson of mass 900  gev with suitably chosen fourth generation fermion masses  @xcite",
    ". precision measurements of the @xmath11 boson decay width  @xcite exclude models in which the fourth neutrino mass eigenstate has a mass less than 45  gev .",
    "if the neutrino masses are very large , however , a fourth generation of fermions is not excluded .",
    "one consequence of the extra fermions is that the @xmath12 coupling is enhanced by a factor of roughly three relative to the sm coupling  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the lowest - order @xmath12 coupling arises from a quark loop .",
    "the top quark contribution is the largest due to its large coupling with the higgs boson . in the limit @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fourth - generation quark mass",
    ", the higgs boson coupling cancels the mass dependence for each of the three propagators in the loop , and the contribution to the @xmath12 coupling becomes asymptotically independent of the masses of the two fourth - generation quarks .",
    "each additional fourth - generation quark then contributes as much as the top quark , and the @xmath12 coupling is thus enhanced by a factor @xmath15 of approximately three .",
    "the production cross section will be enhanced by a factor of @xmath16 . for @xmath17 near the low end of our search range , @xmath18  gev , the @xmath19 production cross section is enhanced by roughly a factor of nine relative to the sm prediction .",
    "this factor drops to approximately 7.5 near the upper end of the search range , @xmath20  gev , assuming asymptotically large masses for the fourth - generation quarks .",
    "the reason for this drop is that the denominator of the enhancement factor , the sm cross section , has a larger contribution from the sm top quark as @xmath17 nears @xmath21 .",
    "the partial decay width for @xmath22 is enhanced by the same factor as the production cross section . however , because the decay @xmath22 is loop - mediated , the @xmath23 decay continues to dominate for higgs boson masses @xmath24  gev .",
    "we consider two scenarios for the masses of the fourth - generation fermions . in the first scenario , the `` low - mass '' scenario , we set the mass of the fourth - generation neutrino @xmath25  gev , and the mass of the fourth - generation charged lepton @xmath26  gev , in order to evade experimental constraints  @xcite and to have the maximum impact on the higgs boson decay branching ratios . in the second scenario , the `` high - mass '' scenario , we set @xmath27  tev , so that the fourth - generation leptons do not affect the decay branching ratios of the higgs boson . in both scenarios ,",
    "we choose the masses of the quarks to be those of the second scenario in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , we set the mass of the fourth - generation down - type quark to be @xmath28  gev and the mass of the fourth - generation up - type quark to be @xmath29",
    ". the other mass spectrum of ref .",
    "@xcite chooses @xmath30  gev , resulting in slightly larger predictions for @xmath31 and nearly identical decay branching ratios .",
    "we use the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) production cross section calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which builds on the nnlo sm calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations have searched for the sm higgs boson in the decays @xmath23 and @xmath32 using all sm production processes : @xmath19 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and vector - boson fusion ( vbf )  @xcite .",
    "the results of these searches for the sm higgs boson can not be used directly to constrain fourth - generation models , as the @xmath12 coupling is enhanced but the @xmath35 and @xmath36 couplings are not , and the signal acceptances and the backgrounds in the multiple analysis channels differ for the various production modes .    previously , the cdf and d0 collaborations have published searches for the process @xmath1 , also neglecting the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and vbf signal contributions  @xcite .",
    "this paper is an update of ref .",
    "@xcite , which provides a fourth - generation interpretation of the @xmath1 searches , and a model - independent limit on @xmath39 . here",
    "we update the searches detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite with those using 8.2  fb@xmath5 from cdf  @xcite and 8.1  fb@xmath5 from d0  @xcite and include additional channels  @xcite .",
    "interpretations of sm higgs boson searches within the context of a fourth generation of fermions have been performed by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite , which exclude @xmath40  gev and @xmath41  gev , respectively .",
    "we present new limits on @xmath42 in which the @xmath19 production mechanism is considered as the unique signal source .",
    "these limits are compared to models for higgs boson production in which the @xmath12 coupling is enhanced by the presence of a single additional generation of fermions . in this comparison ,",
    "the decay branching ratios of the higgs boson are also modified to reflect changes due to the fourth generation relative to the sm prediction . while the decays of the heavy quarks and leptons may include @xmath43 bosons in the final state",
    ", we do not include these as additional sources of signal .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath23 are calculated using hdecay  @xcite modified to include fourth - generation fermions  @xcite .",
    "the modified higgs branching ratio to @xmath44 is multiplied by the cross section  @xcite to predict the fourth - generation enhanced @xmath45 production rate .",
    "we include as an approximation to the uncertainties on the decay branching ratios the relative uncertainties predicted for the sm branching ratios due to uncertainties in @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the branching ratio for the decay @xmath32 is also considerable at large masses , having a peak at around @xmath49  gev and rising above @xmath50  gev . in order to include a search for @xmath2",
    ", we introduce the assumption that @xmath51 remains as predicted by the sm , even though the production cross section is enhanced .",
    "this assumption holds true in fourth - generation models as predicted by the fourth - generation version of hdecay mentioned above . in setting limits on @xmath42",
    ", we include the process @xmath2 assuming that its signal yield scales in the same way as the @xmath44 channel .",
    "the event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d0 analyses .",
    "both collaborations select events with large  and two oppositely charged , isolated leptons , targeting the @xmath52 signal in which both @xmath43 bosons decay leptonically .",
    "d0 selects events containing electrons and/or muons , dividing the data sample into three final states : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "each final state is further subdivided according to the number of jets in the event : 0 , 1 , or 2 or more ( `` 2 + '' ) jets . however , in the fourth - generation interpretation and the model - independent @xmath19 limits , due to the low s / b in the 2-jet multiplicity bin , only the 0 and 1-jet multiplicity bins were taken into account",
    ". decays involving tau leptons are included in two orthogonal ways .",
    "a dedicated analysis ( @xmath56 ) using 7.3 fb@xmath5 of data studying the final state involving a muon and a hadronic tau decay , is included  @xcite .",
    "final states involving other tau decays and mis - identified hadronic tau decays are included in the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 final state analyses .",
    "the cdf analysis separates opposite - sign candidate events into five non - overlapping channels .",
    "events are classified by their jet multiplicity ( 0 , 1 , or @xmath57 2 ) , and the 0 and 1 jet channels are further divided according to whether both leptons are in the central part of the detector or if either lepton is in the forward part of the detector .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents event - by - event reconstruction of the higgs boson mass and thus other variables are used for separating the signal from the background .",
    "for example , the angle @xmath58 in signal events is smaller on average than that in background events , the missing transverse momentum is larger , and the total transverse energy of the jets is lower .",
    "the cdf analyses use neural - network ( nn ) outputs as the final discriminants ; the list of network inputs includes likelihood ratio discriminant variables constructed from matrix - element probabilities  @xcite .",
    "the d0 @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 final state channels use random forest boosted decision tree ( bdt ) outputs as the final discriminants while the @xmath56 channel uses neural networks .",
    "both experiments use separate nns and bdts for the different jet multiplicities to distinguish the @xmath19 signal from the backgrounds for each of the test masses , which are separated by increments of 5 or 10 gev .",
    "cdf introduces a search for @xmath59 using 8.2  fb@xmath5 of data  @xcite .",
    "the discriminant variable is the reconstructed mass of the four leptons @xmath60 .",
    "the version of this search used for the standard model interpretation also includes the expected yield for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath61 production , but these production modes are assumed not to contribute when interpreting the results in this paper .",
    "d0 also includes for the first time channels in which one of the @xmath43 bosons in the @xmath62 process decays leptonically and the other decays hadronically  @xcite .",
    "electron and muon final states are studied separately , each with 5.3 fb@xmath5 of data .",
    "random forests are used for the final discriminants .    both cdf and",
    "d0 conduct all searches included in this paper in the range @xmath63  gev .",
    "the details of the signal and background estimations and the systematic uncertainties are provided in refs .",
    "we set limits on @xmath6 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "we use the same two statistical methods employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the modified frequentist ( cl@xmath64 ) and bayesian techniques , in order to study the consistency of the results .",
    "each method is applied at each test mass to calculate an observed upper limit on @xmath42 .",
    "pseudo - experiments drawn from systematically varied background - only predictions are used to compute the limits we expect to obtain in the absence of a signal .    correlated systematic uncertainties are treated in the same way as they are in ref .",
    "the sources of correlated uncertainty between cdf and d0 are the total inelastic @xmath65 cross section used in the luminosity measurement , the sm diboson background production cross sections ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ) , and the @xmath69 and single top quark production cross sections .",
    "instrumental effects such as trigger efficiencies , lepton identification efficiencies and misidentification rates , and the jet energy scales used by cdf and d0 remain uncorrelated .",
    "to minimize the degrading effects of systematics on the search sensitivity , the signal and background contributions are fit to the data observations by maximizing a likelihood function over the systematic uncertainties for both the background - only and signal+background hypotheses  @xcite .",
    "when setting limits on @xmath6 , we do not include the theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of @xmath6 in the fourth - generation models since these limits are independent of the predictions .",
    "when setting limits on @xmath17 in the context of fourth - generation models , however , we include the uncertainties on the theoretical predictions as described below .    since both the cdf and the d0 analyses categorize events into separate channels based on the number of reconstructed jets , we include the systematic uncertainties on each jet category according to the procedure recommended by ref .",
    "this procedure treats the factorization and renormalization scale uncertainties as independent in the inclusive @xmath19 , @xmath70 or more jets , and @xmath71 or more jets calculations .",
    "we propagate these uncertainties through to the calculations of the exclusive @xmath72  jets , @xmath73  jet , and @xmath74 or more jets calculations required to predict the yields in the fourth - generation models .",
    "when setting a limit on @xmath39 , we do not include a theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of the quantity that we are constraining experimentally .",
    "nonetheless , we do require theoretical input for the differential distributions of the number of jets in @xmath19 production .",
    "we therefore use only the factorization and renormalization scale uncertainties on the @xmath73 or more jets and @xmath74 or more jets inclusive calculations when setting a limit on the inclusive process .",
    "we follow the pdf4lhc prescription  @xcite for evaluating the parton distribution function ( pdf ) uncertainties on the signal predictions .",
    "qcd scale uncertainties that affect the pdf predictions are included as part of the total scale uncertainty , added linearly to the other components of the scale uncertainty .",
    "the remaining component of the pdf uncertainty is treated as uncorrelated with the qcd scale uncertainty .",
    "the scale choice affects the @xmath75 spectrum of the higgs boson when produced in gluon - gluon fusion , and this effect changes the acceptance of the selection requirements and also the shapes of the distributions of the final discriminants .",
    "the effect of the acceptance change is included in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , as the experimental requirements are simulated in these calculations .",
    "the effects on the final discriminant shapes are obtained by reweighting the @xmath75 spectrum of the higgs boson production in our monte carlo simulation to higher - order calculations . the monte carlo signal simulation used by cdf and d0",
    "is provided by the lo generator pythia  @xcite which includes a parton shower and fragmentation and hadronization models .",
    "we reweight the higgs boson @xmath75 spectra in our pythia monte carlo samples to that predicted by hqt  @xcite when making predictions of differential distributions of @xmath19 signal events . to evaluate the impact of the scale uncertainty on our differential spectra",
    ", we use the resbos  @xcite generator , and apply the scale - dependent differences in the higgs boson @xmath75 spectrum to the hqt prediction , and propagate these to our final discriminants as a systematic uncertainty on the shape , which is included in the calculation of the limits .",

    "we do not claim that this excess is statistically significant .    in order to set limits on @xmath17 in these two scenarios ,",
