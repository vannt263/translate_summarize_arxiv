    "this feature plays crucial roles in the dynamical behaviour of soft matter . as an example of typical hierarchical structures of soft matter",
    ", we show such a structure of an amphiphilic surfactant / water mixture in fig .",
    "[ fig : hierarchy ] .",
    "amphiphilic molecules spontaneously form bilayer membranes , which further form higher order organizations such as sponge , lamella , gyroid , and onion structures in water . in this system ,",
    "the motion of the low - level structure , i.e. , hydrodynamic motion of water in this case , can be coupled with the motion of membranes in a dynamical manner : membrane motion causes flow and vice versa .",
    "this type of dynamical coupling between the different levels of the structure leads to intriguing dynamical behaviour of soft matter .",
    "we stress that the characteristic timescale of the high - level structures , e.g. , membranes , is generally much longer than that of the low - level structure such as water , reflecting their size difference .",
    "this we call `` dynamic asymmetry '' between the components of a mixture .",
    "this can be easily understood by the following scaling arguments .",
    "both softness and slowness of soft matter are consequences of the large size of a high - level structure : the elasticity @xmath0 is scaled as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the characteristic lengthscale of the high - level structure and @xmath3 is the characteristic ordering temperature of the system . on the other hand , the characteristic time @xmath4 scale as @xmath5 , with the diffusion constant @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath8 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath9 is the viscosity .",
    "typically , the size disparity between the high- and low - level structure of soft matter is the order of @xmath10 , which results in strong dynamic asymmetry between them . in this lecture note , we consider how such dynamic asymmetry affects phase separation dynamics and pattern evolution",
    ". please refer to the chapter by prof .",
    "mike cates on phase separation of classical binary mixtures , which is the basis of our understanding of phase separation in soft matter .",
    "phase - separation phenomena are commonly observed in various kinds of condensed matter including metals , semiconductors , simple liquids , soft materials such as polymers , surfactants , colloids , biological materials , and food materials .",
    "the phenomena play key roles in pattern evolution of immiscible multi - component mixtures of any materials .",
    "the resulting patterns are linked to optical , electrical , and mechanical properties of materials .",
    "thus , phase - separation dynamics has been intensively studied from both fundamental and applications viewpoints  @xcite .",
    "for example , it was shown recently that a spatially heterogeneous pattern formed by protein phase separation causes a bragg reflection of light , which is an origin of a colour of bird feathers  @xcite .",
    "we speculate that this phase separation may belong to viscoelastic phase separation , which we shall discuss below .    on the basis of the concept of dynamic universality of critical phenomena  @xcite , phase separation in various condensed matter systems",
    "were classified into a few groups .",
    "phase separation in each group is described by a specific set of basic equations describing its dynamic process .",
    "for example , phase separation in solids is known as `` solid model ( model b ) '' , whereas phase separation in fluids as `` fluid model ( model h ) ''  @xcite . for the former the local concentration",
    "can be changed only by material diffusion , whereas for the latter by both diffusion and flow .",
    "the universal nature of critical phenomena in each model and the scaling concept based on the self - similar nature of domain growth have been established  @xcite . in all classical theories of critical phenomena and phase separation ,",
    "however , the same dynamics for the two components of a binary mixture , which we call `` dynamic symmetry ''  @xcite between the components , has been implicitly assumed .",
    "this assumption can always be justified very near a critical point , where the order parameter fluctuations are far slower than any other internal modes of a system ( see fig . [",
    "fig : coupling ] ) . for a mixture",
    "having strong dynamic asymmetry between the components , however , this is not necessarily the case far from a critical point , where most of practical phase separation takes place .",
    "as mentioned above , the presence of dynamic asymmetry means that there is also a large separation between the soft matter mode and the microscopic mode of a system .",
    "furthermore , there is another gross variable of a system , the velocity field , whose relevance in dynamics comes from the momentum conservation law .",
    "thus , dynamic asymmetry leads to complex couplings between the slow critical fluctuation mode , the slow soft matter mode , and the velocity field ( see fig . [",
    "fig : coupling ] ) .    in this article , we review the basic physics of viscoelastic phase separation  @xcite including fracture phase separation  @xcite . we show that with an increase in the ratio of the deformation rate of phase separation to the slowest mechanical relaxation rate the type of phase separation changes from fluid phase separation , viscoelastic phase separation , to fracture phase separation .",
    "we point out that there is a physical analogy of this to the transition of the mechanical fracture behaviour of materials under shear from liquid - type , ductile , to brittle fracture .",
    "this allows us to discuss phase separation and shear - induced instability of disordered materials  @xcite including soft matter  @xcite , on the same physical ground .",
    "finally it should be noted that what we are going to describe in this article has not necessarily been firmly established and there still remain many open problems to be studied in the future .",
    "so this lecture note should be regarded as preliminary trials towards the understanding of complex interplay between thermodynamics , hydrodynamics , and mechanics , in nonequilibrium pattern formation dynamics in soft matter and glassy matter .",
    "before describing how slow modes of soft matter influence phase - separation behaviour , we consider how they affect dynamical critical phenomena .",
    "we first review some fundamental knowledges on dynamic critical phenomena , focusing on the mesoscopic spatial and temporal scales associated with critical fluctuations and then consider how the behaviour is modified by the presence of additional mesoscopic spatial and temporal scales of soft matter .      here",
    "we consider dynamic critical phenomena of a binary mixture , i.e. , model h in the hohenberg - halperin classification @xcite .",
    "the basic equations of model h are given as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the composition deviation from the average value , @xmath13 is the velocity field , @xmath9 is the viscosity , and @xmath14 is a part of the pressure , which is determined to satisfy the incompressible condition ( [ eq : incompress ] ) .",
    "here we assume for simplicity that the hamiltonian @xmath15 is given by the following ginzburg - landau form : @xmath16 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( @xmath2 : a positive constant ) , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are positive constants .",
    "near the critical point @xmath21 , the order parameter fluctuations become mesoscopic .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the spatial correlation of the order parameter fluctuations can be obtained from the above hamiltonian under a harmonic approximation as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the wave number , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the susceptibility .",
    "this functional form is known as the ornstein - zernike correlation function .",
    "both the susceptibility @xmath26 and correlation length @xmath27 diverge towards @xmath21 , respectively , as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a positive constant and @xmath31 is the bare correlation length , @xmath32 is the reduced temperature . here",
    "we note recent experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite suggest the more appropriate form for @xmath33 is @xmath34 , which provides @xmath35 in the limit of @xmath36 .",
    "the critical exponent for the susceptibility @xmath37 is 1 for the mean - field approximation , but 1.24 for the 3d ising universality after the renormalization . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical exponent for the correlation length @xmath38 is 1/2 for the mean - field approximation , but 0.63 for the 3d ising universality .",
    "reflecting the growth of the correlation length @xmath27 , the dynamics of the order parameter fluctuations also slows down while approaching @xmath21 , which is known as `` critical slowing down '' .",
    "the lifetime of the fluctuations @xmath39 is estimated as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the standard dynamical critical exponent .",
    "here @xmath42 is the diffusion constant of a mixture and given by @xmath43 ( see below ) .    here",
    "we briefly review how the diffusional transport can be described under a coupling to the velocity fields in the above framework of model h @xcite .",
    "the transport coefficients of fluids in the linear response regime can be expressed as the time integral of flux time correlation functions . by using the relevant flux @xmath44 , the renormalized transport coefficient @xmath45 for @xmath46",
    "is expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ( solid - type ) bare transport coefficient and negligible compared to the second term .",
    "it can be calculated by decoupling the above four - point correlation function as @xmath49 since the timescale of the order parameter fluctuations @xmath12 is much slower than that of the momentum diffusion ( or , the velocity field @xmath50 ) , we apply the adiabatic approximation in the above and assume @xmath51 . under the incompressible condition ,",
    "the time correlation function of @xmath52 is expressed as @xmath53 by using the ornstein - zernike form for the correlation function @xmath54 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sk ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath55 where the scaling function @xmath56 is called the kawasaki function and @xmath57 for @xmath58 whereas @xmath59 for @xmath60 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the order parameter decay rate @xmath61 is then given by @xmath62 this provides the interesting non - locality of the diffusional transport originating from the presence of the important mesoscopic lengthscale @xmath27 .",
    "next we consider the viscous transport in a critical binary mixture .",
    "the viscosity is expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the non - critical background viscosity of a mixture and @xmath65 . by using a decoupling approximation ,",
    "we can obtain the following expression : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the short cut - off wavelength and @xmath68 . since @xmath69 , we can approximate the above as @xmath70 the more exact calculation yields @xmath71 , which indicates a very weak ( almost logarithmic ) divergence of the viscosity .",
    "the effects of dynamic asymmetry on this anomaly will be discussed below .",
    "now we consider how the dynamic asymmetry between the components of a mixture affects dynamic critical phenomena . here",
    "we note that since the effects are purely dynamical , they do not affect the static critical phenomena . as schematically shown in fig [ fig : coupling ] , the effects of dynamic asymmetry originate from the fact that there is an additional slow mode coming from the large size of a component of a mixture , whose relaxation time we denote @xmath4 .",
    "as described above , there is critical slowing down towards @xmath21 and thus the order parameter fluctuations become slower and slower while approaching @xmath21 .",
    "the characteristic lifetime of the fluctuations @xmath39 always becomes the slowest mode near @xmath21 .",
    "this clear separation between microscopic and critical length and time scale is the heart of the concept of dynamic universality @xcite .",
    "there is no exception for this limiting behaviour for @xmath36 , however , practically this limit of @xmath72 can not be accessed experimentally in a system of strong dynamic asymmetry @xcite .",

    "when approaching the critical point @xmath75 , the order parameter fluctuation mode @xmath39 should eventually become the slowest mode in principle .",
    "in this limit , the relaxation of @xmath74 does not play any role and thus the dynamic universality should hold .",
    "however , this situation may not be practically realized for a system of strong dynamic asymmetry . in phase separation , we should also consider the characteristic time of deformation @xmath76 .",
    "if the deformation rate @xmath76 is faster than the relaxation rate of the slow soft matter mode @xmath4 , the viscoelastic effects have a drastic influence on phase separation .",

    "this is natural , considering that polymer chains locally feels the viscosity of a solvent , but globally the macroscopic viscosity due to many - chain interactions .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes occurs at the mesoscopic lengthscale characterized by the viscoelastic length @xmath78 .",

    "the dynamic asymmetry gives rise to an important new mesoscopic length @xmath78 , which is of purely rheological origin .",
    "we call this @xmath78 the viscoelastic ( or , magic ) length @xcite , which is the characteristic length scale above which dynamics is dominated by diffusion and below which by viscoelastic effects .",
    "this length is a rheological length scale intrinsic to entangled polymer solutions @xcite and other dynamically asymmetric systems @xcite , and nothing to do with critical phenomena .",
    "we can also interpret this length scale as the length up to which the shear stress can transmit .",
    "the shear stress is dominated by the velocity fluctuations of the distance over @xmath78 and of the time @xmath4 .",
    "furukawa predicted that the dynamical asymmetry coupling between the velocity fluctuations and the viscoelastic stress affects the hydrodynamic relaxation process , resulting in a wavenumber - dependent shear viscosity : the viscosity of a polymer solution has the following wavenumber ( @xmath23- ) dependence associated with this length @xmath78  @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the macroscopic viscosity and @xmath77 is the solvent viscosity . the viscoelastic length is approximately given by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the blob size @xcite .",

    "thus , the above results clearly indicate that the viscosity anomaly of critical polymer solutions ( especially , of high molecular weight polymers ) can not be described by `` fluid model ( model h ) '' at least in the experimentally accessible temperature range .",
    "note that @xmath103 approaches the universal value of classical fluids with a decrease in @xmath104 , i.e , towards the limit of dynamic asymmetry .",
    "we ascribed this non - universal behaviour to the existence of an additional slow mode intrinsic to polymer solutions and its dynamic coupling to the critical mode , which is a direct consequence of dynamic asymmetry @xcite .",

    "phase separation of soft matter such as polymer blends , polymer solutions , protein solutions , and emulsions had been believed to be the same as that of classical fluid mixtures ( model h ) @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown about two decades ago that it is not necessarily the case  @xcite . in normal phase separation",
    "observed in dynamically symmetric mixtures ( model h ) , the phase separation morphology is determined by the balance between the thermodynamic ( interfacial ) force @xmath106 and the viscous force @xmath107 while satisfying the momentum conservation . in viscoelastic phase separation ,",
    "on the other hand , the self - generated mechanical force @xmath108 also plays a crucial role in its pattern selection in addition to the thermodynamic @xmath106 and viscous force @xmath107 .",
    "thus we named this type of phase separation `` viscoelastic phase separation ( vps ) '' .",
    "in addition to the solid and fluid model , thus , we need the third model for phase separation in condensed matter , i.e. , the `` viscoelastic model ''  @xcite .",
    "this model is actually a general model of phase separation of isotropic systems including the solid and fluid model as its special cases  @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : analogy ] ) .    intuitively , viscoelastic phase separation can be explained as follows . when there is a large difference in the dynamics between the components of a mixture , phase separation tends to proceed in a speed between those of the fast and slow components .",
    "then , the slow component can not catch up with a deformation rate spontaneously generated by phase separation itself , @xmath76 , and thus starts to behave as an elastic body , which switches on the elastic mode of phase separation .",
    "thus , this phenomenon can be regarded as `` viscoelastic relaxation in pattern evolution '' , which is the reason why we named it _",
    "viscoelastic phase separation _",
    "unlike ordinary mechanical relaxation experiments , the mechanical perturbation is characterized by the rate of deformation induced by phase separation , @xmath76 , and the relaxation rate is that of the slowest mechanical relaxation , @xmath4 , in a system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling ] ) .    without dynamic asymmetry ,",
    "the deformation rate is always slower than the relaxation rate .",
    "thus , phase separation in such a mixture can always be described by the fluid model , no matter how slow the dynamics of the components is .",
    "this is because @xmath72 is always satisfied in the critical regime for dynamically symmetric systems and there is no @xmath23-dependence in @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath78 is a microscopic length . for example , this is the case for a mixture of two polymers having similar molecular weights and glass transition temperatures @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that dynamic asymmetry , which is prerequisite to viscoelastic phase separation , usually exists in any materials , particularly , in soft matter . in this sense",
    ", we may say that `` normal phase separation ( nps ) '' is a special case of viscoelastic phase separation .",
    "shear effects on complex fluids have attracted much attention because of its unusual nature known as `` reynolds effect '' : for example , shear flow that intuitively helps the mixing of the components actually induces phase separation in polymer solutions  @xcite .",
    "this is caused by couplings between the shear velocity fields and the elastic internal degrees of freedom of polymers .",
    "to explain this counter - intuitive behaviour of polymer solutions under shear , there have been considerable theoretical efforts @xcite .",
    "doi and onuki  @xcite established a basic set of coarse - grained equations describing critical polymeric mixtures , based on a two - fluid model whose original form was developed by de gennes and brochard  @xcite for polymer solutions and by tanaka and filmore  @xcite for chemical gels .",
    "later we proposed that an additional inclusion of the strong concentration dependence of the bulk stress and/or the transport coefficient , which are not important in shear - induced instability , is necessary for describing viscoelastic phase separation of dynamically asymmetric mixtures , more specifically , the volume shrinking behaviour of the slow - component - rich phase  @xcite .",
    "we also argued its generality beyond polymer solutions to particle - like systems such as colloidal suspensions , emulsions , and protein solutions @xcite .",
    "that is , we showed that the internal degrees of polymer chains and entanglement effects peculiar to polymer systems are not necessary for viscoelastic phase separation to take place and strong dynamic asymmetry between the components of a mixture is the only necessary condition .",
    "a main difference between shear - induced phase separation and viscoelastic phase separation is that the velocity fields are induced by external shear fields in the former whereas they are self - induced by phase separation itself in the latter .",

    "this makes the validity of the above separation a bit obscure .",
    "thus , we need theoretical justification for the treatment of dissipation , which remains a subject for future investigation .",
    "we note that for mixtures composed of a large particle ( or molecule ) component ( component 1 ) and a simple fluid ( liquid or gas ) ( component 2 ) the stress division becomes almost perfect ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) , reflecting the large size disparity and the resulting large difference in the friction constant .",

    "the local friction force is given by @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the average local friction of component @xmath23 and the mean - field rheological environment at point @xmath112 , where the volume fraction of @xmath23 component is @xmath170 . here",
    "@xmath171 and @xmath172 is proportional to the friction between an individual molecule or particle of the component @xmath23 and the mean - field rheological environment , which we call the generalized friction parameter . because of the physical definition of the mean - field rheological environment ,",

    "we expect that this relation holds , irrespective of the microscopic details of rheological models , and , thus , we may apply it to a mixture of any material , the motion of both of whose components is described by a common mechanism . however , for theoretical estimation of friction coefficients , we need microscopic rheological theories , which are not available for a general case unfortunately . more importantly , as mentioned in sec .",

    "this is particularly important in a mixture whose components having very different @xmath153 , since there is drastic slowing down of the dynamics towards @xmath153 , which gives rise to an extremely strong dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath175 on the composition @xmath46 near @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , formation of a transient gel is not expected for a mixture having little size disparity between its components .",
    "formation of a transient gel or a gel should be specific to a mixture of large size disparity between its components .",
    "thus , for a mixture whose components having very different @xmath153 , we do not expect a significant role of the bulk stress in suppressing the diffusion , unlike the case of a mixture of large size disparity ( see above ) , since there may be no strong @xmath46-dependence of @xmath140 . even in this case",
    ", the strong @xmath46 dependence of @xmath175 can cause an effect similar to the bulk stress , as shown below .",

    "note that the volume change of the polymer - rich ( slow - component - rich ) phase is directly associated with the deformation described by @xmath152 .",
    "so the volume shrinking behaviour peculiar to viscoelastic phase separation is a consequence of ( i ) the slow bulk stress relaxation due to the connectivity of a transient gel formed by the large component and/or hydrodynamic squeezing effects or ( ii ) a steep composition dependence of the diffusion constant @xmath175 .",
    "as will be discussed later , viscoelastic phase separation accompanies mechanical fracture of the slow - component - rich phase and thus nonlinearity of rheology may also play an important role in the pattern evolution . in the above , we assume a simple maxwell - type constitutive relation .",
    "however , we may need more complicated constitutive relations to describe the rheology of materials , since viscoelastic phase separation accompanies mechanical fracture of a transient gel , which intrinsically involves non - linear phenomenon",
    ". two key deformation types in viscoelastic phase separation are elongation ( uniaxial stretching ) and extension ( biaxial extension ) .",

    "the importance of strain hardening in the formation of cellular patterns has been recognized for both synthetic polymers @xcite and food polymers ( e.g. , breads ) @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , strain hardening makes the more viscoelastic phase mechanically more resistive to fracture , or makes the morphological selection due to mechanical force balance more robust ( see eq .",

    "the scenario that gelation is viscoelastic phase separation dynamically arrested by glass transition immediately tells us a crucial difference in the ageing mechanism between gelation and vitrification . in viscoelastic phase separation ,",
    "the coarsening is driven by elastic stress associated with volume shrinking and interfacial tension .",
    "these features are absent in the ageing of glass transition at least in colloidal suspensions due to the conservation of the composition . in ordinary glass transition , which takes place under a condition of constant pressure , the volume of a sample decreases ( or , the density increases ) during ageing since the ageing accompanies the densification due to attractive interactions .",
    "we can say that the ageing of gels proceeds under the momentum conservation while satisfying eq .",

    "next we consider possible effects of a difference in the two types of origins of dynamic asymmetry on pattern evolution : disparity in the size or @xmath153 between the two components . in the above , the domain deformation rate is related to the interfacial tension @xmath37 , or the coefficient @xmath20 .",

    "a transient gel always tends to shrink to reduce the elastic energy as a gel undergoing volume - shrinking transition does @xcite .",

    "this stress leading to volume shrinking of a whole sample must be supported by the boundary to have only internal mechanical instability inducing solvent - hole formation and crack formation . in simulations",
    ", the employment of a periodic boundary condition automatically allows us to avoid long - wavelength instabilities .",
    "the rate of volume shrinking is controlled by the rate of the transport of the fluid component under the stress fields .",
    "in many experimental situations , this elastic stress is supported by the boundary which prevents the shrinking of the overall volume of a transient gel .",
    "this can be realized by wetting or adsorption of the slow - component - rich phase to walls confining a sample . in our experiments using a quasi two - dimensional sample for optical microscopy observation ,",
    "i.e. , for an anisotropic confinement of a sample , on the other hand , volume shrinking in the lateral direction is strongly suppressed by a large friction of the sample to the walls .",

    ", width=302 ]    this special role of the boundary condition in phase separation is a manifestation of the mechanical nature of phase separation , which is common to both viscoelastic and fracture phase separation .",
    "we note that surface crack formation is also affected by such a boundary condition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : crack ] ) . during evaporation of the liquid component",
    ", the volume shrinking of the surface part takes place much faster than the bulk part far from the surface .",
    "thus , the bulk part plays the same role as a fixed boundary condition and supports the mechanical stress , which leads to the formation of surface crack patterns .",
    "surface crack patterns can also be induced by bulk expansion : the slow ( or solid - like ) surface layer can not catch up with the expansion of the bulk .",
    "we also note that surface crack formation can also be caused by cooling of a glassy material from its surface .",
    "this is because surface cooling leads to larger volume shrinking near the surface .",
    "this causes the extensional mechanical stress on the surface , which may induce mechanical fracture of the surface region that becomes solid - like near and below the glass transition upon cooling .",
    "this may be the case for formation of grazes on ceramic or glass mugs .",
    "next we discuss the universal nature of the physical mechanism producing a spongelike morphology .",
    "it is known that gel undergoing volume - shrinking phase transition forms a foam - like structure  @xcite .",
    "we argue that the physical origin of the appearance of a honeycomb structure in plastic foams ( e.g. , polystyrene and urethane foams ) and breads is also similar to that of a network structure in viscoelastic phase separation . for the formation of network patterns in ordinary viscoelastic phase separation , the pressure , @xmath14 , plays only a minor role in the force balance ( or , momentum conservation ) equation : @xmath14 is determined to satisfy the incompressibility condition .",
    "however , the formation of foam structures , which is usually induced by the liquid - to - gas transformation of one of the components of a mixture , accompanies its large volume expansion .",
    "thus the pressure @xmath14 plays a primary role in the pattern selection .",
    "as such an example , we briefly describe a typical formation process of plastic foams ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "first , a polymer matrix absorbing a low - boiling - point solvent is prepared .",
    "then , its temperature is raised above the boiling point of the solvent , which induces bubble formation in the polymer matrix . these bubbles nucleate and grow as the result of evaporation of the solvent from the polymer matrix .",
    "the total volume of the system expands as a result of the liquid - gas transformation of the solvent . in this process",
    ", a pattern is dominated by the mechanical force balance condition with the contribution of the gas pressure @xmath14 .",
    "this is caused by the strongly asymmetric stress division : gas bubbles can not support any mechanical stress besides the hydrostatic pressure and only the polymeric phase can support it . in this way , a cellular pattern is formed .",
    "as mentioned above , it was pointed out that strain hardening plays an important role in the formation of well - developed cellular patterns @xcite .",
    "this may be because strain hardening prevents the liquid - type rapture of cell walls .",
    "thus , it can be viewed as the enhancement of the importance of mechanical stress over interfacial tension in the force balance condition ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ eq : balance ] ) ) .",
    "finally , foam structures are stabilized by glass transition or crystallization , when the stress generated by high internal gas pressure in cells becomes lower than the yield stress of the matrix phase .    to describe this phenomenon we need to use the dynamic equations for compressible liquids .",
    "the force balance can be satisfied only when a gas bubble is surrounded by the matrix phase : the internal gas pressure is balanced with the mechanical stress created by the stretched matrix phase surrounding the gas bubble . it is this feature that leads to the formation of cellular foam structures . as in the case of network formation in viscoelastic phase separation , we can say that the foam structure formation is a mechanically selected pattern formation , and thus can be regarded as a special case of viscoelastic phase separation .",
    "besides the above - explained difference in the morphological selection , the processes of network and cellular pattern formation have an important common feature : holes of a less viscoelastic fluid phase ( gas in plastic foams , water in gels , solvent in polymer solutions , and so on ) are nucleated in a phase - separation process",
    ". then the structure develops while keeping a mechanical force balance condition and a network or form - like structure is transiently formed , depending upon the type of the mechanical force generated . in this process , the relative volume fraction of the more viscoelastic phase in the whole system decreases with time .",
    "furthermore , the limiting process of material transport between the two phases is that in the slower phase .",
    "this suggests that a network or sponge - like structure is the morphology _ universal _ to phase separation in dynamically asymmetric mixtures .",
    "it is worth noting that the pattern selection in viscoelastic phase separation essentially differs from that in phase separation of elastic solid mixtures ( e.g. , metal alloys ) .",
    "we note that elasticity , which is static , does not involve any time scales ( or , velocity fields ) . for elastic phase separation , thus , the momentum conservation , or force balance condition , is irrelevant for the selection of morphology and a pattern evolves solely to lower the elastic energy while obeying the diffusion equation alone .",
    "we emphasize that the momentum conservation is relevant only when a mixture contains a fluid or viscoelastic material as its component .",
    "elastic effects often originate from a lattice mismatch between the two atomic components in solid alloys .",
    "first of all , solid phase separation accompanies little volume change of each phase .",
    "furthermore , the softer phase always forms a network - like continuous phase to minimize the total elastic energy  @xcite , in contrast to the case of viscoelastic phase separation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vis - ela ] ) .",
    "for example , the elastic energy is expressed in terms of the displacement vector @xmath323 as follows for an isotropic elastic body : @xmath324 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the bulk modulus , @xmath130 is the shear modulus , and @xmath135 is the spatial dimension . the leading - order coupling between @xmath46 and @xmath323 is then given by @xmath325 where @xmath326 is the coupling constant . if pattern evolution is slow enough , @xmath323 is determined by the local equilibrium condition @xmath327 . here",
    "we note that @xmath130 generally depends on @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the softer phase with smaller @xmath130 is deformed to form a network structure since the deformation of the softer phase costs less elastic energy than that of the harder phase .",
    "the phase - separation morphology is determined to minimize the elastic energy in solid mixtures , whereas to satisfy the momentum conservation ( or , the force balance ) in liquid mixtures .",
    "concerning the momentum conservation , we note that hydrodynamic degrees of freedom play a significant role in the initial and final stage of viscoelastic phase separation .",
    "for example , network formation in colloid phase separation is significantly influenced by hydrodynamic interactions between colloids @xcite . in the final stage ,",
    "hydrodynamic effects are important to describe rayleigh instability of tubes ( or networks ) and the resulting breakup of tube - like structures which are component structures of a network . in the intermediate stage ,",
    "on the other hand , hydrodynamic effects are not so significant and only the force balance plays an important role in pattern evolution . to describe this regime , thus , we may use langevin ( brownian ) dynamics @xcite , which neglects hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "here we consider shear - induced composition fluctuations and demixing ( or flocculations ) in polymer solutions  @xcite as well as in colloidal suspensions and emulsions  @xcite .",
    "shear - induced composition fluctuations are induced by a steep increase of @xmath9 with @xmath46 .",
    "an intuitive explanation was given as follows  @xcite .",
    "shear - induced demixing is caused by a certain mechanism to store elastic energy under shear .",
    "this elastic energy effectively leads to a change in the free energy functional , which results in an effective shift of the phase diagram and destabilizes a thermodynamically stable system .",
    "however , this picture was turned out to be too simplistic .",
    "it was shown by intensive theoretical studies @xcite that we need to treat dynamical couplings between the composition and stress fields properly for explaining shear - induced demixing of polymer solutions .",
    "this phenomenon is now widely known as `` shear - induced demixing '' in polymer solutions under shear  @xcite .",
    "some time ago we considered whether similar phenomena can be observed in colloidal suspensions , emulsions , and protein solutions or not  @xcite . in polymers ,",
    "the conformational degrees of freedom of chains and entanglement effects play a crucial role in shear - induced instability . since such internal degrees of freedom",
    "are absent in suspensions of particle - like objects , the mechanism to store elastic energy under shear in colloidal suspensions might be essentially different from that in polymer solutions  @xcite . at first sight , thus , shear effects seem less pronounced for colloidal suspensions than for polymer solutions . accordingly",

    "[ fig : general ] .",
    "furthermore , this classification may also be common to that of mechanical fracture @xcite , which is determined by the relation between the time when the mechanical instability sets in , the mechanical relaxation rate , and the deformation rate ( see fig .  [",

    "in summary , we show that viscoelastic phase separation and the concept of dynamic asymmetry are very useful for understanding not only phase separation and gelation in soft matter but also the mechanical instability of soft matter and glassy matter under shear deformation .",
    "we argue that `` dynamic asymmetry '' is one of the key physical concepts in soft matter since it is a consequence of the spatio - temporal hierarchical nature of a system .",
    "we demonstrated that the viscoelastic model including both bulk and shear stress contributions is a very general model that can universally describe phase separation of any isotropic condensed matter .",
    "however , our understanding is still a level of phenomenology and far from the full understanding of the phenomena . in particular , how to describe the constitutive equations of various soft matter and how to generalize them to unstable states where phase separation occurs are of fundamental importance .    we also demonstrate that the formation of heterogeneous network or cellular structures in various materials may be regarded as mechanically driven pattern evolution and understood in the framework of viscoelastic phase separation .",
    "dynamic asymmetry may be a key to the physical understanding of not only phase separation but also mechanical instability of materials under deformation",
    ". the latter may be relevant not only to materials science , but also in engineering ( shrinkage crack pattern formation of concretes ) and geology ( crack in dry mud or rocks ) .",
    "these phenomena of mechanically driven inhomogeneization can be understood in a unified manner on the basis of the concept of dynamic asymmetry with respect to the change in a conserved order parameter .",
    "finally we mention some fundamental remaining problems of the current viscoelastic model .",
    "( 1 ) the dissipation in a dynamically asymmetric mixture may not be given by a simple sum of friction due to the relative motion of the components and hydrodynamic dissipation . here the nonlocal nature of the transport , which is characterized by the viscoelastic length @xmath376 , should also be considered properly in the process of the coarse - graining .",
    "( 2 ) the phenomenological constitutive relation crucially depends on the composition dependence of the elastic moduli and the mechanical relaxation times .",
    "however , there is no firm basis for the physical description of these quantities primarily because there is no theoretical basis for the description of the constitutive relation in an unstable state . for more quantitative understanding of viscoelastic phase separation",
    "it is crucial to overcome these difficult problems .",
    "we hope that this article would contribute to better understanding of pattern formation and mechanical instability of various condensed matter systems , particularly , soft matter , and encourage young researchers to get interested in these intriguing problems .",
