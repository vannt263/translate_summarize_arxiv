    "understanding the evolution of massive galaxies ( e.g. m@xmath0@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) is important because to constrain the different scenarios of structure and galaxy formation . in particular ,",
    "the question on the formation of the present - day massive spheroidals is still one of the most debated issues of galaxy evolution ( see @xcite for a review ) . in one scenario ,",
    "massive spheroidals are formed at early cosmological epochs ( e.g. @xmath3 ) through a short and intense episode of star formation ( with @xmath4 m@xmath2yr@xmath5 ) , followed by a passive evolution ( or pure luminosity evolution , ple ) of the stellar population to nowadays . in marked contrast",
    ", the hierarchical scenarios predict that massive spheroidals are the product of rather recent merging of pre - existing disk galaxies taking place mostly at lower redshifts and with moderate star formation rates @xcite . in hierarchical merging scenarios ,",
    "fully assembled massive field spheroidals with m@xmath0@xmath1 m@xmath2 at @xmath61 are very rare objects @xcite ( see also baugh , this volume ) .    from an observational point of view , a direct way to test the above scenarios is to study the evolution of massive galaxies by means of spectroscopic surveys of field galaxies selected in the @xmath7-band @xcite .",
    "since the near - ir light is a good tracer of the galaxy mass@xcite , @xmath7-band imaging allows to select massive galaxies at high-@xmath6 . a galaxy with a stellar mass of about @xmath1 m@xmath2 is expected to have @xmath8 for @xmath9 @xcite , thus implying that moderately deep @xmath7-band surveys can efficiently select massive galaxies in that redshift range .",
    "deep spectroscopy with 8 - 10 m class telescopes can then be used to search for massive systems and to constrain their redshift distribution .",
    "in order to investigate the evolution of massive galaxies and to constrain the currently competing galaxy formation scenarios , we started in 1999 a project that was called `` k20 survey '' .",
    "for such a project , 17 nights were allocated to our team in the context of an eso vlt large program distributed over a period of two years ( 1999 - 2000 ) ( see also http://www.arcetri.astro.it/@xmath10k20/ ) .",
    "the prime aim of such a survey is to derive the redshift distribution of about 550 @xmath7-selected objects with @xmath11 .",
    "the targets were selected from a 32.2 arcmin@xmath12 area of the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ; @xcite ) using the images from the eso imaging survey public database ( eis ; http://www.eso.org/ + science / eis/ ; the raw @xmath13-band images were reduced and calibrated by our group ) , and from a 19.8 arcmin@xmath14 field centered at 0055 - 269 using ntt+sofi @xmath13-band imaging ( fontana et al . in preparation ) .",
    "optical multi - object spectroscopy was made with the eso vlt ut1 and ut2 equipped with fors1 ( october - november 1999 ) and fors2 ( november 2000 ) during 0.5@xmath15 - 1.5@xmath15 seeing conditions and with 0.7@xmath15 - 1.2@xmath15 wide slits depending on the seeing . the grisms 150i , 200i ,",
    "300i were used with typical integration times of 1 - 3 hours .",
    "dithering of the targets along the slits between two fixed positions was made for most observations in order to efficiently remove the ccd fringing and the strong oh sky lines at @xmath16   .",
    "the spectra were calibrated using standard spectrophotometric stars , dereddened for atmospheric extinction , corrected for telluric absorptions and scaled to the total @xmath17-band magnitudes .",
    "a small fraction of the k20 sample was observed with near - ir spectroscopy using the vlt ut1+isaac in order to derive the redshifts of the galaxies which were too faint for optical spectroscopy and/or expected to be in a redshift range for which no strong features fall in the observed optical spectral region ( e.g. @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , due to the lack of a multi - object spectroscopy mode in isaac , it turned out very hard and inefficient to obtain redshifts of faint galaxies in this manner , which was successful only for a few galaxies at @xmath19 with strong h@xmath20 in emission .",
    "in addition to spectroscopy , @xmath21 imaging is also available for both fields , thus providing the possibility to estimate photometric redshifts for all the objects in the k20 sample , to `` calibrate '' them through a comparison with the spectroscopic redshifts and to assign reliable photometric redshifts to the objects for which it was not possible to derive the spectroscopic @xmath6 ( see fontana et al .",
    ", these proceedings ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were completed in december 2000 .",
    "the spectral analysis was done by means of automatic software ( iraf : rvidlines and xcsao ) and through visual inspection of the 1d and 2d spectra .",
    "because of four nights lost due to the bad weather , only 94% of the sample with @xmath22 could be observed .",
    "the efficiencies in deriving the specroscopic redshifts for the observed targets was high : @xmath23=95% , 93% , 91% for @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the overall spectroscopic redshift completeness is still rather high , with @xmath25=93% , 91% , 85% for @xmath26 respectively ( where @xmath27 ) .",
    "the size of the sample , the spectroscopic redshift completeness , and the availability of tested and reliable photometric redshifts make the k20 sample one of the largest and most complete database to study the evolution of @xmath7-selected galaxies available to date .",
    "kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) estimated that @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the galaxies in a @xmath30 sample are expected to be at @xmath31 , respectively in a ple and in a standard cdm hierarchical merging model ( cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "such a large difference was in fact one of the main motivations of our original proposal to undertake a redshift survey for all objects down to @xmath30 .",
    "however , more recent models consistently show that the difference between the predictions is less extreme than in the kc98 realization ( menci et al .",
    ", pozzetti et al . , somerville et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "part of the effect is due to the now favored @xmath32cdm cosmology which pushes most of the merging activity at earlier times compared to @xmath33cdm and scdm models , and therefore get closer to the ple case .",
    "moreover , a different tuning of the star - formation algorithms ( to accomodate for more star formation at high @xmath6 ) also reduces the differences between the two scenarios .",
    "our database is currently being used to perform a stringent comparison between the observed redshift distribution and the ones predicted by the most recent models of galaxy formation ( cimatti et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "besides the main goal described here above , our unique database is also being used to address other important questions on galaxy evolution : _ ( 1 ) _ the evolution of the luminosity and mass functions ( see pozzetti et al .",
    ", this volume ) , _ ( 2 ) _ the evolution of ellipticals , _ ( 3 ) _ the fraction of dusty starbursts and high-@xmath6 ellipticals in the ero population , _ ( 4 ) _ the evolution of galaxy clustering ( see daddi et al . , this volume ) , _ ( 5 ) _ the spectral properties of a large number of galaxies and their evolution as a function of redshift , _ ( 6 ) _ the volume star formation density using different indicators , _ ( 7 ) _ the fraction of agn in @xmath7-selected samples , _",
    "( 8) _ the brown dwarf population at high galactic latitude .",
    ") and dusty star - forming eros ( bottom ; @xmath34 ) with @xmath11 . ,",
    "scaledwidth=100.0%,height=453 ]    a fraction of the galaxies selected in the near - infrared show very red colors ( e.g. @xmath35 ) .",
    "such galaxies are known as extremely red objects ( eros ) , and the most recent surveys demonstrated that they form a substantial field population @xcite . since their colors are consistent with being either old passively evolving galaxies or dusty starbursts or agn , it is therefore of prime importance to determine their nature in order to exploit the stringent constraints that eros can place on the galaxy formation scenarios . in this section",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath36 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "is shown with a vertical bar ranging from the minimum observed density ( 32% of the total density of eros observed in the k20 survey ) and the maximum possible density ( 64% of the total density of eros assuming that all the spectroscopically unidentified eros are old passive systems ) .",
    "the dashed and solid lines show the predictions of ple models adopting respectively the local luminosity function of ellipticals @xcite and of early - type galaxies ( 2mass , @xcite ) , and using bruzual & charlot spectral synthesis models with solar metallicity , salpeter imf , @xmath39-folding time of the star formation @xmath33=0.3 gyr , and a set of formation redshifts ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "see also @xcite for more details on ple models .",
    "the arrows indicate the predicted densities of eros in two recent hierarchical merging models ( the somerville et al . model shown in firth et al .",
    "2001 , and the cole et al .",
    "2000 model presented in smith et al .",
    "since such models predict the total density of _ all _ eros ( i.e. old + dusty star - forming ) they actually represent upper limits to the predicted density of old passive systems . , scaledwidth=100.0%,height=453 ]    from our total @xmath22 sample , 78 eros with @xmath41 were extracted .",
    "about 70% of the eros with @xmath41 and @xmath42 was spectroscopically identified with _",
    "old _ and _ dusty star - forming _ galaxies at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the two classes are about equally populated and for each of them we derived the average spectrum ( fig .",
    "old eros have an average spectrum consistent with being old passively evolving ellipticals , and it can be well reproduced with bruzual & charlot ( 2000 ) spectral synthesis models with no dust extinction and ages 3 gyr if @xmath44 , thus implying an average formation redshift @xmath402.4 for such a metallicity .    the average spectrum of star - forming eros can be reproduced only if a substantial dust extinction is introduced , typically in the range of @xmath45 .",
    "their star formation rates , corrected for the average reddening , suggest a significant contribution ( @xmath4620% ) of eros to the cosmic star - formation density at z@xmath101 .",
    "however , the detection of [ nev]@xmath473426 emission suggests that a fraction of star - forming eros also host some agn activity obscured by dust .",
    "since old eros have spectra consistent with being passively evolving ellipticals , we compared their density with different model predictions ( see fig .",
    "the main result is that the density of old eros observed in our survey is strongly underpredicted by the current hierarchical merging models ( a factor of @xmath10410 for the models presented by @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "on the other hand , ple models with a reasonable choice of input parameters predict surface and comoving densities in agreement with the observations and imply that massive spheroidals formed at @xmath48 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "since the luminosities and the stellar masses of the observed old eros are in the range of 0.5 - 4@xmath49 and 1 - 6@xmath50 m@xmath2 , this means that fully assembled massive systems were already in place up to @xmath51 .",
    "the existence of such galaxies with a comoving density of @xmath52 mpc@xmath53 at @xmath54 ( @xcite ) is in contrast with the @xmath32cdm hierarchical model of @xcite , where the comoving density of _ all galaxy types _ with m@xmath55 m@xmath2 is about one order of magnitude lower , whereas the difference is less dramatic with the model of @xcite ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
