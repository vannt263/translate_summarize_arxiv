    "following the seminal work of barabasi _",
    "et al_. @xcite , the scientific community has put a lot of effort into the study of network theory .",
    "a network is a collection of vertices connected by edges .",
    "often vertices represent natural elements or events and the edges relations by which those elements or events are connected .",
    "as it is a simple framework , network theory can be applied to a wide variety of natural phenomena , including social sciences @xcite , biology , genetics @xcite , geology @xcite and linguistics @xcite .",
    "the extraordinary similarities that such different phenomena display when represented by network theory provide us with the opportunity of finding common principles for the organisation of many elements in nature .",
    "we begin this work with the empirical study of a linguistic network built from the novel of herman melville , @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is a multi - directed eulerian network @xcite , based on the relation of adjacency , where the tokens of the novel , words and punctuation , are the vertices , and two vertices are linked if the tokens they represent are adjacent in the text .",
    "we then analyse a scientific collaboration network , that is a network in which vertices are the authors of scientific published papers related to network theory @xcite , and two vertices are connected if the authors they represent coauthored the same paper .",
    "these networks are suitable for analysis as weighted network @xcite , that is they are networks in which pairs of vertices represent events that are related more than once in the phenomenon",
    ". this multiple relation can be expressed by a weight on their mutual link , the weight representing the number of times the relation is repeated . to completely describe the network , we introduce the weighted adjacency matrix @xmath2 , that is a matrix whose elements @xmath3 represent the number of links connecting vertex @xmath4 to vertex @xmath5 . in the case of an undirected network , such as the scientific collaboration network , this matrix is symmetric , and there is no difference between out and in vertices properties . in the case of a directed network , such as the language network ,",
    "the matrix is not symmetric , and the out and in vertices properties are generally different .",
    "we define the out - degree and in - degree @xmath6 of vertex @xmath4 as the number of its out and in nearest neighbours and we have @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the heaviside function .",
    "we define the out - strength and the in - strength @xmath9 of the vertex @xmath4 as the number of its outgoing and incoming links , that is @xmath10 .    to understand the properties of complex system , it is common to consider random systems as a null hypothesis .",
    "we apply this concept to our networks by considering the classical measures ( weight , strength , degree , clustering coefficient , nearest neighbours degree ) applied to the real networks , and then again after shuffling the vertices of the network . in the case of the linguistic network",
    "the strength of a vertex is equivalent to the frequency of the token the vertex represents .",
    "the shuffling operation , in this case , consists of shuffling the tokens of the novel .",
    "this operation does nt alter the frequency of the tokens and so the strength distribution remains unchanged .",
    "in particular , if we call @xmath11 , the frequency of a token with strength @xmath12 and @xmath13 the rank of a word in the definition given by zipf @xcite , we have that @xmath14 , that is a direct relation between the rank and the strength of a token .",
    "hence , as is already well known , the shuffling operation does nt alter zipf s law . in the same way , in the case of the scientific collaboration network , the strength of a vertex represents the number of papers an author published .",
    "the shuffling operation preserves this number and hence the strength distribution remains unchanged .    in this paper",
    "we will show that , in both our networks , the degree distribution is not altered by the shuffling process , and seems to be determined by the strength distribution .",
    "we then introduce a new measure , the _ vertex selectivity _ , that reflects the correlations of the networks and is greatly changed in the shuffling process .",
    "we test this measure with an ad - hoc stochastic network characterised by short range correlations .",
    "_ moby dick _ is a text that is large enough to be suitable for a statistical analysis and , since it is considered by the critics and by the people a very well written text , we are confident that the statistical empirical laws arising from it are characteristic of laws of language @xcite . after shuffling the tokens of the novel , we will compare some empirical measures between the shuffled and the original text .",
    "@xmath0 @xmath1 has a vocabulary @xmath15 of 17169 tokens , with a total size @xmath16 of 264978 tokens . since the network is eulerian @xcite we have that @xmath17 , for every vertex @xmath4 .",

    "the result implies that the scale free strength distribution is not determined by the scale free weight distribution.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    from the top of fig.[f1 ] we can see that the distribution of the degree of the vertices is not significantly altered in the shuffling process .",
    "this result implies that the scale free degree distribution is induced by the scale free strength distribution .",
    "in fact the shuffling operation redistributes the numbers that occupy the rows of the weighted adjacency matrix in an uncorrelated way .",
    "this operation preserves the strength of the vertices , but changes their degree .",
    "however , as we can see , the average degree distribution is statistically preserved .",
    "this is an important result in network theory .",
    "in fact the distribution of the degree of a vertex , that is the distribution for the number of its nearest neighbours , is supposed to give a great deal of information about the system . in this case",
    "we can see that this measure can not distinguish between a masterpiece and a meaningless collection of words .    to prove that the reverse does nt hold ,",
    "that is the scale free degree distribution does nt induce a scale free strength distribution , we shuffle the network preserving the degree of the vertices .",
    "this operation consists in randomly redistributing the weights of the links between all the existing links . in reality",
    "it would consist in rewriting @xmath0 @xmath1 with the same vocabulary , the same total number of tokens , but changing the relative frequency of the tokens .",
    "we show the resulting strength distribution in the bottom of fig.[f1 ] compared to the one obtained from the real network .",
    "it is evident that the distributions obtained with the shuffling operation are peaked and well distinguishable from the ones obtained from the real network .",
    "the tails of these distributions are still power laws , but with a slope different from the one for the original network .",
    "we derived the exponents for the tails of the distributions for @xmath20 with the _ method of maximum likelihood _ proposed by newman in @xcite and we calculated the error on the exponent with the _ bootstrap method _ @xcite , with 2000 replicas for the normal network and 4000 replicas for the shuffled network . in this way we found that the real network strength distribution displays a power law tail with exponent @xmath21 , while the shuffled network strength distribution displays a power law tail with exponent @xmath22 for the in - strength and @xmath23 for the out - strength distribution .",
    "the straight connection between strength distribution and degree distribution can be explained by the power law relation between strength and degree . in fig.[f0 ] we show the empirical data for @xmath24 before and after the shuffling process . in both the cases we observe a relation of the type @xmath25 . since @xmath26 , then @xmath27 .",
    "this power law relation holds only in average though .",
    "in fact , as we ll discuss at the end of this section , the relation between strength and degree is more complex and deep .",
    "the weight distribution @xmath28 for linguistic networks , such as that for other scale free weighted networks , is a power law . from the left panel of fig.[f3 ]",
    "we can see that if we shuffle the text the resulting weight distribution does nt vary significantly .",
    "the only difference that can be appreciated between the distributions of fig.[f3 ] is in their tails .",
    "in fact the range of values for the weight in the normal text is larger than that in the shuffled text .",
    "if we shuffled the entries of the adjacency matrix without preserving the strength of the vertices , the weight distribution would dramatically change in a uniform distribution .",
    "again we can argue that the power law distribution for the weight of the vertices is induced by the scale free strength distribution .    to prove that the strength distribution is not implied by the weight distribution we shuffle the network preserving its weight distribution .",
    "this is done by randomly shuffling the cells of the adjacency matrix , preserving the weights of the shuffled cells . in the right panel of fig.[f3 ] we show the results of this experiment . for the shuffled network the resulting strength distribution is peaked .",
    "nevertheless it displays a power law behaviour for many decades , but with a slope much steeper than that of the real network .",
    "again we derived the exponents for the tails of the distributions for @xmath20 with the method of maximum likelihood and we calculated the error on the exponent with the bootstrap method using 5000 replicas for the shuffled network . in this way we found that the shuffled network out - strength distribution displays a power law tail with exponent @xmath29 , compared to the exponent of the tail of the original distribution , that is @xmath21 .",

    "most of the tokens with small out - selectivity are tokens that appear just a few times in the text ( core lexicon@xcite ) , but there are also tokens that appear many times in the text and that are characterised by small values of the out - selectivity .",
    "these are the tokens that connect with a different token each time , that is they are not selective in the choice of their neighbourhood . for this latter case words like @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59,etc ...",

    "an important aspect for the vertex selectivity measure is its range . for the normal text",
    "the range for the vertex selectivity is much larger than the one for the shuffled text , and , in the case of the in - selectivity , this difference is of one order of magnitude .",
    "this comes from the fact that in the real text the tokens are selective in choosing their neighbours and form very specialised local structures .",
    "the lack of those local structures determines the small values for the selectivity in the shuffled text and so the big difference of the selectivity distributions between the shuffled and the real text . another important point",
    "to notice in fig.[f5 ] is that in the case of the real text the distribution of the selectivity appears to follow a power law for many decades of the selectivity .",

    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    a question one could raise is about the robustness of selectivity , that is if its regularities are present in other linguistic networks . to answer this question",
    "we consider the same analysis on two other novels , _  nineteen eighty - four \" _ by george orwell @xcite , and _  on the road \" _ by jack kerouac @xcite . in fig.[fn ] we show the out - selectivity distribution for the two novels compared to the ones obtained after shuffling the networks , preserving the strength of the vertices .",

    "moby dick_. the distributions appear to follow a power law decay with exponent around @xmath68 for many decades of the out - selectivity @xmath69 .",
    "the range of the out - selectivity for the real texts is much larger then the one found in the shuffled texts .",
    "moreover in the case of _ moby dick _ and _ nineteen eighty - four _ the out - selectivity distribution is unresolved for large values of the out - selectivity , maybe because of finite size effects . in the case of _ on the road _",
    "( right panel of fig.[fn ] ) the distribution tail for large values of out - selectivity is cleaner and is very well fitted by a power law with exponent @xmath70 .",
    "it is important to notice that just the @xmath71 of the very frequent tokens of the novel generates this second tail .",
    "we believe that , since the vertex selectivity is related to the morphologic structures of language , its behaviour is strictly related to the style of the writer . anyway",

    "we consider the scientific papers published between the 2000 and 2007 containing the word @xmath72 or @xmath73 in the title .",
    "we define the vertices of the network to be the different authors of the paper and two vertices to be connected if they represent coauthors of the same paper .",
    "the weights of the links are defined as the number of times two authors coauthored . in this case , since the relation of coauthorship is reflexive , the network is undirected and the weighted adjacency matrix symmetric . the selectivity for vertex @xmath4 is then defined as @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting network , obtained by 5335 papers , has 9503 vertices and 26966 undirected links with an average strength @xmath75 , average degree @xmath76 and average selectivity @xmath77 .",
    "we then shuffled the vertices of the network and considered the resulting network .",

    "we show the comparison of the degree distributions between the shuffled and the real network .",
    "we do nt have to be alarmed by the fact the scale free behaviour in this case is not as straight as in the language network , since this is a characteristic of this peculiar network ( for instance see analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "the important aspect of the analysis is that it is very difficult to infer which of the networks is the shuffled one by looking at its degree distribution .",
    "it is possible to observe that in the shuffled case the range of values for the degree is larger .",
    "this is implied by the lack of topological correlations of the shuffled system , so that the vertices tend to link to a larger number of different vertices .",
    "nevertheless this difference is so slight that it is not possible to consider it as a way of discriminating between the two different networks . in particular , in the case of the linguistic network ,",
    "the maximum degree of the real network is larger then the one found in the shuffled network , even if the average degree is smaller .",

    "we show a comparison between the distributions of the selectivity for the two networks .",
    "this time the difference is striking , the normal network displaying a power law distribution with exponent around -4.5 , the shuffled network displaying an ill - defined distribution . in this case",
    "large values of the selectivity characterise authors that have exclusive relations with a few other authors .",
    "so , for instance , an author having a great affinity with another author , that is an author who had written all or almost all his / her papers with the same coauthor will be characterised by a large value of selectivity .",

    "this behaviour is due to the fact that all the papers written by more then two authors form clustered structures . in the shuffled version of the network those triangular structures completely disintegrate . in the right panel of fig.[f8 ] we show the comparison of the average nearest neighbour degree @xmath79 , averaged for each degree @xmath37 , for the normal and the shuffled network . in the case of the real network , an assortative behaviour is evident for small values of the degree , after that the behaviour appears to fluctuate around an average . in the case of the shuffled network",

    "the scale free degree distribution for the two resulting networks has the same power law exponent , as shown in the left panel of fig.[f7 ] .",
    "from the right panel we can see that , while a full gpa attachment rule produces a distribution for the selectivity similar to the one measured in the shuffled networks of the previous sections , the mixed gpa and lpa attachment produces a selectivity distribution that fits with the empirical behavior of fig.[f6 ] .    to check",

    "the values considered for @xmath83 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "again we can see from the left panel that the scale - free degree distribution is not altered by the local attachment processes . in the right panel",
    "we can observe that for the network grown by lpa the selectivity distribution follows approximatively a power law with exponent -5 , while for the network grown without lpa the selectivity distribution is ill defined .",
    "many real networks in nature are weighted networks .",
    "these networks , for instance food webs , ecological networks , linguistic networks , social and urban networks deserve special attention , as their study will improve our knowledge of their organisation and allow us to understand the way to act on them . in this paper",
    "we have tried to address the question of the dependence between different properties of weighted networks .",
    "the complexity of such large real systems seldom allows an analytical approach to the problem .",
    "this is the reason we applied an algorithmic procedure that , even if not as strong as the analytical one , is strong enough to yield conclusions , and is reproducible . in the light of this , we considered the standard measures on networks and , after shuffling the networks conserving each time a peculiar symmetry of the system , we compared the new measures to understand which properties of the networks were preserved .    for this study we first considered a linguistic network .",
    "the reason for this choice is that a novel is a closed system that can be analysed in the framework of network theory without ambiguity and from many points of view , such as time series analysis and information theory analysis .",
    "moreover the availability of data sets in linguistics is huge , data sets can be as large as desired and we know exactly the formal rules of the composition , that is the syntax .",
    "the reason to choose novels instead of other kinds of literary networks such as journals , dictionaries or other linguistic standards such as the british national corpus @xcite , is because we believe that the process of writing a piece of art is in itself a trial to make the structure of the text more similar to the surrounding environment .",
    "it is probably the reason why well written novels display cleaner statistical behaviour . moreover",
    "a novel can be considered as a  closed \" system in the sense that it contains all the information to understand it , for instance no references are needed . in this sense",
    "we believe a novel to be the best sample to consider in order to study the properties of language .",
    "the affinity of a system like a novel to systems such as food webs , or social systems , as we saw in this paper , can be surprising , but it has already been considered in philosophy .",
    "in fact , many philosophers consider social and linguistic systems to be characterized by a strict analogy . in both systems , internal @xmath94 or identities",
    "are linked by differential relations and can be @xmath95 - that is related - so as to become @xmath96 of a specific articulated totality .",
    "this entails that the very process of articulation will modify their previous identity @xcite .    with this in mind",
    ", we algorithmically demonstrated that the scale free degree distribution and the scale free weight distribution of the analysed weighted networks are implied by the scale free strength distribution and that the reverse does nt hold .",
    "we also noticed that in a network such as the linguistic one , that is not highly clustered , the behaviour of the average clustering coefficient and of the average nearest neighbour distribution does nt change in the shuffling process .",
    "it s not the same in the case of the scientific collaboration network , where the clustering is an important growth fingerprint . in this case both the high average clustering coefficient and the assortative nearest neighbour degree behaviour are lost in the shuffling operation .",
    "this means that those properties are very important for the description of some specific networks , but not for all of them .",
    "we then introduced the selectivity measure , defined as the average weight distributed on the links of a single vertex .",
    "we showed that this measure is able to statistically catch the local structures of networks and so to easily distinguish a real network from a shuffled network . in the case of language",
    "large values for the selectivity indicate tokens that have an exclusive relation with other tokens and that form morphological structures . in the case of the scientific collaboration network",
    "large values of the selectivity indicate authors that have exclusive relations with a few other authors . via an ad - hoc stochastic network we showed that the selectivity of the vertices is very sensitive to the correlations in the system .",
    "the fact that novels , investigated at the level of tokens , have long range fractal correlations is already well known @xcite .",
    "nevertheless vertex selectivity is not a measure of first order correlations .",
    "the normalised weight of the links between tokens , or at least its deviation from the average weight , should be the best candidate for measuring such topological correlations .",
    "the problem is that the scale - free distribution for the frequency of the tokens implies the invariance of the scale - free behaviour for the weight distribution so that it is very difficult to determine if the system is highly correlated or not ( see left panel of fig.[f3 ] ) . in this sense vertex selectivity",
    "is not related to any of the classical correlation measures , it s just a measure that characterises the quality of the differential relations between pairs of elements in the system .",
    "moreover it is worth mentioning that the measure of the selectivity is not really clean .",
    "that is quite evident from the figures in which , even with a large logarithmic binning , data do nt align very well . in order to better understand the data and the finite size effects it would be interesting to carry out further research to examine the data using some of the more recent techniques for finite sample statistics @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that if the mean field approach is well defined for the calculation of the degree distribution in the barabasi - albert model , that is an unweighed tree network , then it is not applicable to weighted networks without considering the correlations naturally arising in the adjacency matrix .",
    "the usual approach tends to conflate the strength and the degree @xcite and the analytical results hold for the straight connection between the two measures .",
    "the fact that in the analysed networks the degree distributions for real and shuffled networks are indistinguishable implies that in our empirical studies the degree distribution is implied by the strength distribution .",
    "the strength distribution represents the number of times an event appears or interacts in the system .",
    "this number has been considered in information theory and analysed via the shannon entropy @xcite , the degenerate shannon entropy @xcite and the kolmogorov or @xmath97 entropy @xcite .",
    "the entropic approach to language requires one to maximise the amount of information of a system by minimising opportune quantities , usually via lagrange multipliers , such as the receiver effort .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this goal can be achieved if the distribution of the number of elements in the system is a power law @xcite . in particular , through the degenerate entropy approach , that considers all the elements in the system with the same frequency as equivalent , it is possible to reproduce the exponential cutoff for small values of the strength in the strength distribution , evident in fig.[f6 ] and in many other networks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since the shannon entropy is defined through the relative frequency of the elements of the system , this measure does nt account of the peculiar arrangements of the elements , that is if we shuffle the elements of the system , the resulting shannon entropy or degenerate shannon entropy does nt change",
    ". a more sophisticated approach via information theory is suggested by the work of scientists dealing with food webs @xcite .",
    "in fact they define entropy based on the actual fluxes between trophic species , that is based on the weights of a weighted adjacency matrix .",
    "this type of approach takes into account the differential relations between the different elements of the system .",
    "such an approach was recently considered in network theory in @xcite . unfortunately , despite promising results , the analytical development of the approach is difficult .",

    "we would also like to thank andrea mura for many useful suggestions .",
