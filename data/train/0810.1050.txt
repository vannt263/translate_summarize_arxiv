    "it has long been known that the hosts of powerful radio  loud agn are massive early  type galaxies , and that the probability of such a galaxy hosting a radio source increases rapidly with optical luminosity and stellar mass ( auriemma et al .",

    "what remains less clear is the role ( if any ) of a galaxy s environment in determining whether it hosts a radio source .",
    "studies carried out in the 1980s hinted at significant differences between the clustering properties of the powerful frii radio galaxies and the less powerful fri sources . based on an imaging study of 43 radio galaxies at @xmath15 0.3 , heckman et al .  ( 1986 ) found that the most powerful radio sources ( with radio luminosities above @xmath16whz@xmath5 at 408mhz ) lay in regions of below ",

    "in contrast , less powerful radio sources appeared to be associated with morphologically ",
    "normal early - type galaxies in regions of high local galaxy density .",
    "similar results were obtained by prestage & peacock ( 1988 ) , who used an angular cross  correlation technique to study the clustering environment of a sample of about 200 nearby ( @xmath15 0.15 ) radio galaxies .",
    "they found that fri radio galaxies lay in regions of significantly enhanced galaxy density , whereas the clustering environment of frii sources was similar to that of the overall population of ` normal ' elliptical galaxies .",
    "the picture changed significantly in the mid 1990s with the work of ledlow & owen ( 1996 ) , who discovered that the division in radio power between fri and frii radio sources was a strong function of the optical luminosity of the host galaxy . as a result , frii",
    "radio sources are generally hosted by less optically luminous ( and less massive ) galaxies than fri sources of similar radio power .",
    "since more massive galaxies also tend to be more strongly clustered , this effect needs to be taken carefully into account when analysing the clustering properties of powerful radio sources .",
    "ledlow & owen ( 1996 ) measured the bivariate radio luminosity function ( rlf ) of early  type galaxies in rich clusters , and found no statistically significant difference between the rlfs of galaxies in rich clusters and in the field .",
    "their results suggested that the local environment plays little or no role in determining whether an early  type galaxy hosts a radio  loud agn , and that the optical luminosity and other properties of the host galaxy are by far the most important parameters affecting radio source formation and evolution .      the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys like the 2dfgrs and sdss ( colless et al .",
    "2001 ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , combined with `` all  sky '' radio continuum surveys like nvss and sumss ( condon et al .  1998 ; bock et al .",
    "1999 ) made it possible to assemble samples of thousands of objects with which to carry out statistical analyses of radio galaxies in the local universe ( best et al .",
    "2005b ; mauch & sadler 2007 ) .",
    "the nvss and sumss source catalogues are large and uniform enough that the characteristic imprint of large  scale structure can easily be seen in the angular correlation function ( blake & wall 2002 ; blake et al .",
    "2004 ) . convolving the angular clustering amplitude in these surveys with a characteristic redshift distribution n(@xmath17 )",
    "suggests that the present  day clustering length @xmath9 of radio galaxies is in the range of 710@xmath8mpc , corresponding to a clustering strength similar to optically  luminous elliptical galaxies in moderately rich environments ( see e.g. overzier et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "recently , best et al .  ( 2007 ) have revisited the question of radio  source clustering using data sets much larger than those available to ledlow & owen ( 1996 ) . using a sample of 625 nearby galaxy groups and clusters selected from the sdss , they show that the brightest galaxies in groups and clusters ( bcgs ) are more likely to host a radio  loud agn than other galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "the probability is increased by up to a factor of two for the most massive galaxies ( with stellar mass @xmath18m@xmath19 ) , and by over an order of magnitude for galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath20m@xmath19 .",
    "this enhanced likelihood of radio  loud agn activity was only seen in the innermost regions of a group or cluster ( i.e. within 0.2@xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the virial radius of the cluster ) .",
    "best et al .  (",
    "2007 ) argue that the radio properties of both bcgs and non - bcgs can be explained if the radio emission is mainly fuelled by cooling gas from an x  ray halo surrounding the galaxy .",
    "it therefore appears that although the radio properties of most galaxies in the local universe are largely unaffected by their environment , this is not true for massive galaxies located in the central regions of clusters .      at",

    "( 2007 ) recently combined data from the 2slaq luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) redshift survey ( cannon et al .  2006 ) and the nvss and first radio surveys ( condon et al .  1998 ; becker et al .  1995 ) to identify a volume  limited sample of 391 radio galaxies at redshift @xmath22 .",
    "they measured the redshift ",
    "space correlation between the radio  detected 2slaq lrgs and the full lrg sample , and found that the 2slaq radio galaxies were more strongly clustered than the overall 2slaq lrg population .",
    "since the 2slaq radio galaxies as a class were also more optically luminous than the overall lrg sample it was unclear whether the increased clustering was a luminosity effect , or represented a genuine difference in the environments of radio  loud and radio  quiet lrgs at @xmath12 .",
    "in the current paper , our goal is to answer this question by investigating the clustering properties of radio  loud 2slaq lrgs in more detail .",
    "the inferred lifetimes of the radio sources associated with massive galaxies ( typically 10@xmath2310@xmath24yr ; parma et al .",
    "1999 ) are significantly shorter than the ages of their parent galaxies , so it is generally assumed that all massive galaxies must cycle between radio - loud and radio - quiet phases over time .",
    "feedback mechanisms in which the hot intergalactic gas episodically cools to fuel a central agn , and is then reheated by the ensuing radio jets ( e.g. binney & tabor 2005 , ciotti & ostriker 2007 ) provide a natural explanation for this process .    for the 2slaq lrg sample , johnston et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that the stellar populations of radio  detected and radio  quiet galaxies are generally indistinguishable .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which ` radio - mode ' agn feedback ( bower et al .",
    "2006 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ) regulates the star ",
    "formation rate in these massive galaxies , and all of them undergo radio  loud episodes when their central black hole is active and can power radio jets . if this is the case , then the fraction of galaxies which are detected as radio sources above some radio power p@xmath25 simply represents the fraction of the radio  galaxy duty cycle for which a typical galaxy is a radio source at or above this level .",
    "observationally this is complicated by the fact that the radio luminosity function of agn is very broad , spanning at least six orders of magnitude ( mauch & sadler 2007 ) , and there is also a strong correlation between radio power and optical luminosity ( auriemma et al .",
    "1977 , best et al .",
    "the observed radio detection rate will therefore depend strongly on both radio power and galaxy luminosity . in this paper",
    "we consider only the very luminous early  type galaxies which comprise the 2slaq lrg sample , so that the range in optical luminosity is small .",
    "we also use the term ` radio  detected ' to refer to galaxies whose 1.4ghz flux density is higher than the 12mjy detection limit of the first and nvss radio surveys . since the 2slaq lrg radio sample is close to volume  limited ( see figure 7 of sadler et al . 2007 )",
    ", this translates to a limiting radio luminosity of @xmath26whz@xmath5 .    throughout this paper , we assume a flat @xmath27dominated cosmology with @xmath28=0.27 , @xmath29=70 km s@xmath5mpc@xmath5 , and @xmath30=0.8 unless otherwise stated .",

    "[ cols=\"^ , < , > \" , ]     despite the differences in the analytic and actual hods the analytic hod does provide good fits to the clustering and space density of the samples within the errors .",
    "table [ tab : halomass ] gives the values @xmath31 determined from fitting the analytic hod to the measured hod and the clustering as well as that determined directly from the simulation .",
    "@xmath31 is overestimated by @xmath327% fitting the analytic form to either measured hod or clustering for both the volume and magnitude limited samples , due to the excess of galaxies in the ` bump ' in the hod at low halo masses .",
    "the difference between the fits to the hod and the clustering is larger for the magnitude  limited sample , but is still only at the 2% level and is consistent with the error on the fit to the clustering .",
    "we can therefore be confident that the likely magnitude of any systematic error on @xmath31 caused by fitting the hod to a magnitude limited rather than volume  limited sample is less than the measurement errors for all the samples considered in section [ sec : halo ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that a larger systematic error in @xmath31 would be introduced if the true hod is not well represented by the assumed analytic form of the hod .",
    "however , one would expect still relative measurements of @xmath31 to be representative even in this case ."
