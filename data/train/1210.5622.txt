    "the standard model  ( sm ) gauge symmetry of elementary particles based on the @xmath0 has been tested very accurately . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of the neutrino masses has been established  @xcite .",
    "this is clear evidence of the new physics beyond the sm because neutrinos are massless in the sm . since neutrinos are electrically neutral , they can be majorana particles unlike the other sm fermions  @xcite .",
    "the reason why neutrino masses are very different from those of the other sm fermions might be the majorana property of neutrinos .",
    "the most familiar utilization of the majorana property to generate tiny neutrino masses is the so - called type - i seesaw mechanism in which @xmath1-singlet right - handed neutrinos mediate in the tree diagram  @xcite .",
    "because of the suppression by mass scales of new heavy particles , naturally light neutrinos can arise .",
    "another typical prescription to obtain tiny majorana neutrino masses is the so - called radiative seesaw mechanism  @xcite , where neutrino masses are induced at the loop level . in these models ,",
    "the suppression of neutrino masses can be achieved by the loop suppression factor and/or a combination of new coupling constants even if new particles are not very heavy .",
    "the masses of charged leptons involved in the chirality flipping loop provide further suppression of the neutrino masses in some of such models  @xcite .",
    "although the lepton number is conserved in the sm , the addition of the majorana mass term of neutrinos breaks the lepton number conservation by two units .",
    "the measurement of the lepton number violating  ( l#v ) processes such as the neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite is extremely important because it gives evidence that neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "such processes are naively expected to be very rare because neutrino masses are very small .",
    "this is true for the type - i seesaw model with very heavy right - handed neutrinos because light majorana neutrino masses are unique lepton number breaking parameters at the energy scale which is experimentally accessible .",
    "however , in radiative seesaw models , a trilinear coupling constant for light  ( e.g.  tev - scale ) scalars can be more fundamental than light neutrino masses as the l#v parameter at the accessible energy scale",
    ". then , l#v processes via the trilinear coupling constant can be significant at the tev - scale even if the neutrino masses are suppressed enough .",
    "new particles related to the neutrino mass generation are usually produced via the electroweak interaction , and therefore the production cross sections are not so significant at the lhc .",
    "however , new particles in the loop of the radiative seesaw models can be charged under the @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "such a colored particle can easily be produced at hadron colliders . in these models ,",
    "decay patterns of new colored particles could be related to the form of the neutrino mass matrix constrained by the neutrino oscillation data  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a radiative seesaw model with a scalar leptoquark multiplet and a scalar diquark multiplet .",
    "majorana masses of neutrinos are induced via the two - loop diagram where colored particles are involved in the loop .",
    "the lepton number violation is caused by the trilinear coupling constant of the leptoquarks and diquark , which can produce a characteristic signature at the lhc .",
    "the signature consists of two qcd jets and a pair of same - signed charged leptons without missing energy , which would be easily observed at the lhc .",

    "<S> we investigate a model in which tiny neutrino masses are generated at the two - loop level by using scalar leptoquark and diquark multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> the diquark can be singly produced at the lhc , and it can decay into a pair of leptoquarks through the lepton number violating interaction . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent decays of the two leptoquarks can provide a clear signature of the lepton number violation , namely two qcd jets and a pair of same - signed charged leptons without missing energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the signal process is not suppressed while neutrino masses are appropriately suppressed . </S>"
