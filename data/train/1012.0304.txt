    "trapped ion systems are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing  @xcite , precision measurements  @xcite , and quantum chemistry  @xcite . for many of these applications",
    "it is required to cool the ions to low temperatures . to this end , various techniques such as laser cooling , resistive cooling , sympathetic cooling by other ions , or buffer gas cooling are routinely used .",
    "ultracold atomic gases have recently become available in hybrid systems with trapped ions  @xcite , extending the concept of buffer gas cooling to ultralow temperatures .",
    "understanding this new regime and how it relates to conventional buffer gas cooling is essential for any future application to trapped ions .",
    "cooling of an ion in a buffer gas is caused by elastic collisions .",
    "they are dominated by the long range polarization interaction , and cross - sections are considerably larger than for collisions between two neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "therefore , collision rates are large and cooling is expected to be efficient  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proposed that internal degrees of freedom of ionic molecules could also be cooled by using an ultracold buffer gas  @xcite .",
    "another specific feature of the polarization interaction is that collisions affecting the ion s mobility happen with rates independent of the collision energy  @xcite .",
    "this can lead to simplified system behaviour and has , for example , been applied in ion mobility spectrometry  @xcite .",
    "the motion of an ion in a radiofrequency ( rf ) trap can be decomposed into a fast driven motion , the micromotion , and a slow secular motion . in every collision",
    "the energy of the rf - field couples via the micromotion to the neutral atom s energy and the ion s secular energy .",
    "this can lead to ion energy removal or intake , sensitive to the rf - phase in the moment of the collision  @xcite .",
    "the average effect of many collisions results in cooling or heating and depends on parameters such as the ratio between the mass of the ion @xmath0 and the mass of the neutral atom @xmath1 . for very heavy neutrals runaway heating of the ion",
    "is expected  @xcite , whereas very light neutrals enable efficient buffer gas cooling . in the mass ratio regime between the two extremes increased ion trap loss can be observed  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been explained by non - thermal energy distributions of the ion obtained from monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "such numerical simulations are a well established tool to model a trapped ion interacting with a buffer gas  @xcite",
    ". they can account for energy dependent scattering rates , complex electric field geometries , and other experimental parameters , which are difficult to treat analytically . in previous calculations , buffer gases at ambient temperatures",
    "have been assumed , and the cooling of the ion has been limited to the buffer gas temperature .",
    "however , in the recent experiments with ultracold neutral buffer gases a new energy scale related to excess micromotion has become dominant .",
    "the direct relation between the ion s mean energy and the excess micromotion has been observed in  @xcite , for a system of @xmath2 .    here , we investigate the kinetics of a single ion colliding elastically with an ultracold buffer gas , by applying monte carlo techniques .",
    "the effects on the ultracold neutral cloud are modelled using a semiclassical differential cross - section .",
    "the results on neutral atom loss and temperature increase , and the dependence of ion energy on excess micromotion are in good agreement with experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : simmodel ] we describe the basic simulation procedure and the underlying physical model .",
    "the classical langevin interaction model is applied in section  [ sec : langevinscattering ] to derive the ion s energy statistics depending on the mass ratio , trap geometry , and scattering rate . in section  [ sec : secmiclassicalscattering ] we explain effects on the neutral atom cloud as a result of the energy dependent differential cross - section and the non - uniform neutral density distribution .",
    "the time evolution of a trapped single ion colliding with ultracold atoms is modelled using a simulation consisting of an analytical and a numerical part . in the time between collisions ,",
    "trajectories are analytically described using the pseudo - potential approximation , while elastic collisions are taken into account using monte carlo techniques .",
    "we consider a single ion confined by the rf - quadrupole potential of a linear paul trap @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the rf - voltage amplitude applied with frequency @xmath5 to electrodes at a distance @xmath6 away from the trap symmetry axis . in addition , we consider a static quadrupole potential confining the ion along the trap symmetry axis with trapping frequency @xmath7 , @xmath8 q is the ion s charge .",
    "mathieu equations describe the classical motion of an ion in the combined potential ( see for example  @xcite ) , using the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 . for @xmath12",
    "the floquet solution to first order in @xmath13 yields    [ eqn : rion ] @xmath14\\\\   r_{ion , y}&=   a_y\\,\\sin(\\omega_y\\,t+\\varphi_y ) \\,\\left[1-\\frac{q}{2}\\sin(\\omega_t\\,t)\\right ] \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is usually referred to as the pseudo - potential approximation .",
    "it consists of a rapidly oscillating micromotion term and the secular motion , which is harmonic with frequencies @xmath15 and amplitudes @xmath16 .",
    "a full secular trajectory @xmath17 including the harmonic motion along the trap symmetry axis is described by three energies @xmath18 and three phases @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 this formula , describing a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator , will be used throughout the following calculations to approximate the ion s position .",
    "the total secular energy @xmath22 will be referred to as the ion energy .",
    "the motion of the ion is affected by collisions with the neutral atoms .",
    "we assume them to be instantaneous , meaning , the timescale of the collision is shorter than @xmath23 , which is the shortest timescale of the motion of the ion .",
    "this assumption implies that every collision is sensitive to the momentary relative velocity , including the micromotion  . ] .",
    "therefore , we consider a number of effects causing contributions to the micromotion .",
    "firstly , the intrinsic micromotion described in eqn . is proportional to the distance of the ion from the centre of the rf - quadrupole field .",
    "secondly , static offset electric fields displace the minimum of the ion trapping potential by a distance @xmath24 from the symmetry axis of eqn .. thirdly , rf pickup on end - cap electrodes can lead to micromotion along the trap symmetry axis .",
    "these contributions are summed in the expression @xmath25 where @xmath26 parameterizes the micromotion along the trap symmetry axis   out of phase , therefore proportional to @xmath27 , which can arise , for example , from rf - phase mismatches on opposing electrodes .",
    "they are added to @xmath28 for simulations where specific experimental data is to be represented  @xcite . ] .",
    "the ion velocity considered for collisions is @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "this is similar to the time derivative of eqn .",
    "but includes all the excess micromotion terms .",
    "the simulation uses classical trajectories for the motion of the ion .",
    "therefore , its validity is restricted to ion energies well above the energy quanta of secular motion @xmath31 .",
    "the temperature of the ultracold buffer gas is assumed to be well below this energy scale , and in the collision the neutral atom s initial energy is neglected . due to conservation of energy and momentum ,",
    "the elastic scattering process is defined by the scattering angles @xmath32 .",
    "the ion s velocity changes according to @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) being the initial ( final ) velocity given by eqn . at the time of the collision , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the rotation matrix determined by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with respect to the direction of @xmath34 . from @xmath40 and @xmath17 a new set of @xmath19 and @xmath18 can be determined , which describes the ion s trajectory after the collision .    to illustrate its impact on the motion of the ion , eqn .",
    "can be rewritten in terms of the secular velocity , yielding @xmath41 this expression shows how @xmath28 couples to the secular velocity in every collision .",
    "note that @xmath28 is , by definition of eqn .",
    ", the same before and after the collision since it only depends on the position @xmath17 and time @xmath42 of the instantaneous collision .",
    "the probability @xmath43 for the ion to collide with a neutral atom within a short time interval @xmath44 defines the scattering rate @xmath45 it is proportional to the neutral atom density @xmath46 at the ion s position .",
    "the cross - section @xmath47 is usually a function of the collision energy @xmath48 , which , neglecting the energy of the neutral atom , is given by @xmath49 .    the ion s position changes on a timescale of @xmath50 while the velocity of the ion @xmath51 changes on a timescale of @xmath23 . in general , @xmath52 will therefore be time dependent in a non - trivial way . the sampling method used to efficiently choose the time of collision",
    "is explained in appendix  [ app : colltimesampling ] .",
    "a technical description of the main simulation loop is given in appendix  [ app : simulationloop ] .",
    "inelastic processes like charge exchange , spin exchange or molecule formation have been predicted to occur in the hybrid system  @xcite . in experiments",
    "@xcite , charge exchange , which is typically signaled by the loss of the ion , has been observed at rates many orders of magnitude lower than the elastic collision rate , in the non - resonant case .",
    "spin exchange collisions can occur with rates comparable to elastic scattering  @xcite , and energy from internal states can be transferred to the external degrees of freedom . in a spin - stretched configuration ,",
    "however , spin exchange is suppressed .    in our simulation",
    ", we can include inelastic effects by introducing additional , competing rates , defined as in eqn . , but with inelastic cross - sections @xmath53 instead .",
    "the effect of any inelastic event on the hybrid system depends primarily on the question whether the original ion still exists after the process .",
    "if this is not the case , the simulation can be stopped at the first occurrence .",
    "if the ion continues to exist , the amount of energy released or absorbed by the internal states of the colliding particles needs to be considered in a modified version of eqn .. in either case , our simulation is able to predict the rate at which inelastic events occur , given the inelastic cross - section @xmath53 .",
    "on the other hand , the simulation can be used , if a rate is measured experimentally , to determine @xmath53 .    in the following sections we consider elastic processes only , assuming inelastic processes either to happen very rarely , in line with the experimens  @xcite , or to involve only small amounts of internal energy , which do not significantly affect the system .",
    "for the motion of an ion in a neutral gas , mainly large angle scattering is considered relevant , as small deflections do not significantly change the ion s trajectory .",
    "this assumption leads to the langevin scattering model , which successfully describes the ion s mobility in previous experiments with ions in a neutral buffer gas . here",
    ", we apply the langevin scattering model to the trapped ion system including the effects of micromotion .",
    "we investigate the properties of the ion s energy and will later compare these results with those from a more complete semiclassical scattering model , in section  [ sec : secmiclassicalscattering ] .",
    "we will indeed find good agreement between the two models in describing the energy distribution of the ion , confirming the above assumption , that large angle scattering events determine the evolution of the ion s energy .",
    "the ion - neutral interaction is dominated by the attractive polarization interaction , which is of the form @xmath54 with @xmath55 being proportional to the neutral particle polarizability @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the internuclear separation .",
    "classically one can define a critical impact parameter @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "collisions with impact parameter @xmath59 lead to small deflections and are neglected .",
    "impact parameters @xmath60 result in inward - spiralling trajectories , which lead to almost uniformly distributed scattering angles into all directions as in hard - sphere scattering . the resulting cross - section for large angle scattering",
    ", @xmath61 is proportional to the inverse collision velocity , and leads to a scattering rate independent of the collision energy  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to determine the energy scale of the ion on its classical trajectory after many collisions such that the initial conditions for @xmath18 can be neglected .",
    "neither the langevin scattering at its energy - independent rate , nor the ultracold neutral buffer gas , which we assume at @xmath62 , introduce such a scale . as a consequence the only energy scale in the system is defined by the excess micromotion , see eqn .. this is in contrast to the case of a buffer gas with non - negligible temperature , where the energy scale is rather set by the temperature of the neutral gas  @xcite .    to associate the excess - micromotion with an energy scale we define @xmath63 with @xmath64 being the full velocity amplitude of the micromotion for an ion in the centre of the ion trapping potential . @xmath64",
    "depends on the displacement @xmath24 caused by the uncompensated offset electric field .",
    "note that when the offset electric field is compensated using a photon correlation measurement  @xcite , photon shot noise usually limits the lowest achievable @xmath65 .    since @xmath65 is the only energy scale in the colliding system it is sufficient to express all energies in units of @xmath65 .",
    "this gives general results for any amplitude of uncompensated micromotion .",
    "it also implies that any statistical measure of ion energy has to scale with @xmath65 and therefore with the square of the excess micromotion amplitude .",
    "such quadratic dependence of the mean ion energy has been experimentally observed in  @xcite .      in order to treat scattering in the presence of micromotion in its most general form",
    "we choose all trap frequencies ( @xmath66 ) to have irrational ratios .",
    "we assume a very low homogeneous neutral atom density such that the scattering rate @xmath67 is much smaller than the trap frequencies .",
    "this ensures that two consecutive collisions happen at uncorrelated positions .",
    "we obtain the energy spectrum from the simulation by binning the secular energy after each collision on a logarithmic scale .",
    "this measures a logarithmic energy probability distribution @xmath68 .",
    "fig.[fig : langevinthermal ] shows such energy spectra for three different mass ratios of the atom and the ion . for heavier neutral atoms the mean energy of the ion increases and a tail in the spectrum towards higher energies becomes dominant .",
    "energy spectra of the ion for three different mass ratios .",
    "energies are sampled into logarithmically spaced bins with an energy resolution of 100 bins per decade .",
    "we choose @xmath70 and @xmath71 and trap parameters @xmath72 . in the case where the ion mass is twice the neutral mass ( black ) the ion s mean energy is @xmath73 , in the case for equal masses ( red ) @xmath74 .",
    "the red dashed line corresponds to a thermal energy distribution with @xmath74 .",
    "the spectrum for a lighter ion , @xmath75 ( blue ) , contains a significant contribution of very high energies , typically leading to quick ion loss due to finite trap depth . ]    even for equal masses ( @xmath76 ) the tail towards high energies is evident when compared to the thermal distribution with the same mean energy .",
    "for any mass ratio , the obtained spectrum distinctly differs from a thermal distribution , also because very low energies ( @xmath77 ) are extremely rare .",
    "this supports the validity of the classical treatment of trajectories and instantaneous collisions ( @xmath78 ) .    a power law",
    ", @xmath79 nicely fits the tail in the spectrum towards high energies for @xmath80 or @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath82 is increased further , towards even heavier neutrals , the negative exponent @xmath83 approaches 0 , at which point the spectrum does not converge with time anymore and runaway heating starts to dominate the evolution of the ion s energy .",
    "the critical mass ratio parameter @xmath84 can be found by extrapolating the exponent @xmath85 towards @xmath86 .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 is not a universal number but is a function of the trap geometry .",
    "it depends on the ratio @xmath87 or , expressed in the ion trap parameters @xmath88 and @xmath13 , on @xmath89 .",
    "the dependency is explained by the fact that axial confinement leads to radial deconfinement and thereby to an increase of the ratio between average micromotion and secular energy . for three different cases the extrapolation to @xmath84",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : betacritvsqsqbya ] .",
    "our data are compatible with the critical mass ratio previously found for a specific trap geometry  @xcite . for very elongated traps ( @xmath90 )",
    "we find @xmath91 , corresponding to a mass ratio @xmath92 .",
    "the exponents @xmath83 obtained from fitting power laws to the high energy tails of the ion energy spectra are plotted against the mass ratio coefficient @xmath82 .",
    "this is done for three different trap geometries , for a spherical trap ( @xmath93 , black rectangles ) , for an elongated trap ( @xmath72 , red circles ) and for the extreme case with negligible axial confinement ( @xmath94 , blue triangles ) .",
    "the data is fitted with second order polynomials to extrapolate to @xmath84 for which the exponent @xmath83 becomes 0 . ]      to evaluate the effectiveness of buffer gas cooling for different mass ratios we calculate the average of the energy spectrum of the ion . as a physical measure",
    ", the arithmetic mean comes close to the definition of a temperature , albeit the clearly non - thermal distribution .",
    "we show the arithmetic mean in fig.[fig : avgenandreqtrapdepvsbeta ] for the case @xmath72 .",
    "although the arithmetic mean diverges for @xmath95 , the energy spectrum can still be normalized for @xmath96 . in this range",
    "the median continues to be a well defined statistical measure for the energy of the ion .    in experiments ,",
    "a large probability density at high energies leads to a rapid ion loss due to a finite trap depth @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "we have numerically evaluated the required trap depth @xmath97 to limit the ion loss probability per collision to @xmath98 ( fig.[fig : avgenandreqtrapdepvsbeta ] ) . for large @xmath82",
    "we can approximate the required trap depth by @xmath99 .",
    "the results show that mass ratios with light neutrals are preferred for efficient buffer gas cooling",
    ". however , even for the heavy neutral scenario stable trapping and buffer gas cooling are possible for carefully chosen trap geometry , trap depth and micromotion compensation .    for different @xmath82 the ion s arithmetic mean energy ( black rectangles ) and median energy ( red circles )",
    "are shown in units of @xmath65 .",
    "the arithmetic mean is expected to diverge for @xmath100 .",
    "an example for the required trap depth for @xmath101 is given ( blue triangles ) and compared to @xmath99 ( dotted line ) using @xmath83 obtained from power law fits to the tails of the energy spectra .",
    "all data are for @xmath72 . ]      for all the results discussed so far the collision rate has been assumed very low , and as long as the condition @xmath102 is fulfilled the results remain unchanged . as the collision rate approaches or even exceeds the trap frequency @xmath103 , the probability to have consecutive collisions at correlated positions increases . under this condition",
    "we observe a reduced median energy and an increased power law tail .",
    "up to this point the classical langevin model has been used to explore the ion s energy spectrum and its dependence on mass ratio , trap geometry and collision rates . here",
    "we make use of a semiclassical description of the interaction process .",
    "the solution to the quantum mechanical scattering problem can be found by expanding the wavefunction into partial waves . in the regime where many partial waves contribute ,",
    "the total elastic cross section scales like @xmath104  @xcite .",
    "the resulting energy dependent scattering rate and angular dependence lead to additional effects as compared to the langevin model .",
    "these are necessary to explain the back action on the neutral cloud .",
    "we model the interaction potential by the long range polarization interaction of eqn . plus",
    "repulsion at short distances .",
    "the full differential cross - section is calculated using  @xcite @xmath105 the angular momentum of a partial wave is @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the collision momentum .",
    "the scattering phase @xmath108 can be obtained by solving the radial schrdinger equation which involves the centrifugal potential @xmath109 .",
    "the resulting centrifugal barrier increases in height with angular momentum ( @xmath110 .",
    "partial waves with @xmath111 have a collision energy larger than the height of the centrifugal barrier , probe the deep potential well and are reflected from the hard core .",
    "the exact form of the potential , relevant to determine @xmath108 , is typically not known .",
    "therefore phase shifts @xmath108 for @xmath112 are assumed to be uniformly distributed within @xmath113  @xcite . in this approximation",
    "each partial wave contributes with @xmath114 to the total cross - section .",
    "summing @xmath115 up to @xmath116 reproduces the langevin cross - section .",
    "the full quantum mechanical cross - section includes additional contributions from partial waves with @xmath117 .",
    "as the centrifugal barrier is higher than the collision energy , these partial waves are scattered from the centrifugal barrier , if tunnelling effects are neglected .",

    "a scattering rate @xmath67 sets the probability for a collision to take place within a time interval @xmath44 . in our case",
    "@xmath168 with @xmath169 being the neutral atom density , @xmath170 the cross - section and the velocity @xmath51 as defined in eqn .. usually the density is a function on the ion s position , the cross - section depends on the collision energy and @xmath51 oscillates rapidly in time , leading to a @xmath52 with non - trivial time dependence . in the following",
    "we explain the method used to randomly generate collision times @xmath42 with the exact distribution defined by @xmath52 .    in general ,",
    "the process of an event ( collision ) taking place with a rate @xmath52 can be modelled using a differential equation for the probability @xmath171 that the event has not yet happened after the time @xmath42 , @xmath172 the probability distribution for an event to take place after the time @xmath42 is defined by @xmath173 . in the simple case with constant @xmath174",
    "the solution is @xmath175 and a random time can be obtained using inverse transform sampling , @xmath176 with @xmath177 being a uniformly distributed random number in the interval @xmath178 $ ] . for time",
    "dependent @xmath52 the analytic solution for the probability distribution function is @xmath179 non - trivial time dependence of @xmath52 usually requires a numerical approach to sample @xmath42 from eqn .. one straight - forward method would be to discretize time into small steps , calculate @xmath52 and its contribution to @xmath180 for every step , thereby numerically integrating the function @xmath180 up to a randomly chosen trigger value , at which point the event takes place .",
    "however , another method is employed here , which proves to be much faster and does not suffer from discretization errors .",
    "it works for @xmath52 that have an upper bound @xmath181 , or where such a condition can be enforced by introducing a cutoff . in the specific case of the trapped ion , all factors in eqn .",
    "are easily limited by considering the energies @xmath18 defining the trajectory and the excess micromotion parameters and using the peak neutral density .",
    "this upper bound can be adjusted after each collision event having affected @xmath18 and @xmath46 .",
    "the algorithm works by advancing the system by a time @xmath42 according to eqn . with @xmath182 .",
    "then the rescaled rate @xmath183 is calculated for the resulting state of the system after the time @xmath42 and an event takes place if @xmath184 , with @xmath177 being another uniformly distributed random number in the interval @xmath185 . if the event does not take place ( @xmath186 ) the algorithm iteratively loops back to advance the system by an additional @xmath42 , again according to eqn .. the method is exact in that it reproduces the probability distribution function eqn .. a proof follows below .",
    "the efficiency of the method is the ratio of the average of @xmath52 and @xmath187 , @xmath188 .",
    "this means that in order to generate @xmath189 events it can be expected that @xmath52 needs to be evaluated @xmath190 times .",
    "_ proof : _ we start from writing an expression for the probability distribution function @xmath191 obtained with the suggested method . since the final @xmath42 can be the result of any number of iterations , @xmath191 is a sum of all these possibilities , @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the probability that @xmath42 results as the time of event after @xmath194 iterations .",
    "the first few terms are given below .",
    "@xmath195 @xmath196 @xmath197 note that the products of @xmath198 ( as defined in eqn . ) in the integrals always combine to @xmath199 .",
    "therefore @xmath200 is taken out of the sum as a common prefactor , @xmath201 now the upper boundaries of all the partial integrals can be set equal to @xmath42 , since they only induce ordering to the time series @xmath202 .",
    "this rescales the terms by the number of possible orderings ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "then the partial integrals reduce to a single integral to the power of @xmath169 , @xmath204 combining this with eqn . gives @xmath205 and it follows with eqn . and eqn .",
    "@xmath206 this is identical to eqn . which proves that the method reproduces the exact probability distribution",
    "the following is a short description of how the main simulation loop has been implemented .",
    "the setup of the system configuration in ` 1 ) ` contains mainly parameters which do not change during the collisions , such as trap frequencies or the atom - ion mass ratio .",
    "exceptions are the neutral atom number @xmath136 and temperature @xmath137 , which act as initial conditions .",
    "the initial state for the ion energy in ` 2 ) ` is mostly unimportant , as the simulation will iterate over many collisions and the information of the initial state is lost after a few collisions . when looking at steady state statistics of the ion energy , the values after the first few collisions can simply be ignored ,",
    "thus effectively letting the system evolve for a short time before measuring its properties .",
    "the points ` 3 ) ` to ` 7 ) ` implement the collision time sampling algorithm described in appendix[app : colltimesampling ] .",
    "the maximally possible collision rate @xmath187 is calculated from the peak density @xmath207 of the neutral atoms and on the maximum value of @xmath208 .",
    "the latter is limited by the highest possible ion velocity , which depends on the secular energy @xmath18 and the excess micromotion .",
    "the calculation of @xmath209 in ` 6 ) ` uses the @xmath210 and @xmath211 obtained in ` 5 ) ` to determine @xmath52 with eqn .. if a collision takes place at the chosen time @xmath42 , ` 7 ) ` gives the scattering angles according to the differential cross - section . `",

    "9 ) ` modifies the velocity of the ion . in `",
    "10 ) ` the new trajectory parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are determined , to represent the motion of the ion up to the next collision .",
    "information on any system parameter can be retrieved at user - defined points within the simulation loop .",
    "the ion energy is typically registered after ` 10 ) ` , the collision and transferred energies , @xmath48 and @xmath140 after ` 8) ` .",
    "random sampling is used in ` 4 ) ` and ` 6 ) ` , to determine the time of collision , and in ` 7 ) ` , for the scattering angles .",
