    "the reduction of friction in practical applications has been studied since antiquity .",

    "3000 b.c . and",
    "illustrate the transition from sleds to wheels ( see hamrock & dowson ( 1981 ) for a historical overview ) .",
    "while this advance certainly reduced friction , further reductions were possible upon the introduction of a viscous lubricating fluid in the axle joints .",
    "the theoretical underpinings of fluid lubrication in such geometries can be traced back to the work of reynolds ( 1886 ) , who studied the mechanics of fluid flow through a thin gap using an approximation to the stokes equations , now known as lubrication theory .",
    "recent efforts in this technologically important problem have focused on modifications of reynolds lubrication theory to account for elastohydrodynamic effects ( elastic surface deformation due to fluid pressure ) , piezoviscous behavior ( lubricant viscosity change due to high pressure ) , and thermoviscous behavior ( lubricant viscosity change due to frictional heating ) ( dowson & higginson 1959 ; odonoghue , brighton & hooke 1967 ; conway & lee 1975 ; hamrock & dowson 1981 ) .",
    "inspired by a host of applications in physical chemistry , polymer physics and biolubrication , in this paper we focus on the elastohydrodynamics of soft interfaces , which deform easily thereby precluding piezoviscous and thermoviscous effects .",
    "there have been a number of works in these areas in the context of specific problems such as cartilage biomechanics ( grodzinsky , lipshitz & glimcher 1978 ; mow , holmes & lai 1984 ; mow & guo 2002 ) , the motion of red blood cells in capillaries ( lighthill 1968 ; fitz - gerald 1969 ; tzeren & skalak 1978 ; secomb _ et al .",

    "_ 2002 ) , polymer brushes ( klein , perahia & warburg 1991 ; sekimoto & leibler 1993 ) and vesicles ( abkarian , lartigue & viallat 2002 ; beaucourt , biben & misbah 2004 ) .",
    "another related phenomenon is that of a bubble rising slowly near a wall ; the bubble s surface deformation then leads to a lift force ( leal 1980 ; takemura _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) . instead of focusing on specific applications , here",
    "we address a slightly different set of questions : how can one generate lift between soft sliding surfaces to increase separation and reduce wear ? what is the role of geometry in determining the behavior of such systems ? how do material properties influence the elastohydrodynamics ? are there optimal combinations of the geometry and material properties that maximize the lift force ? and finally , can the study of soft lubrication lead to improved engineering designs and be of relevance to real biological systems ?    to address some of these questions we start with the simple case of two fluid - lubricated rigid non - conforming surfaces sliding past one another at a velocity @xmath1 as shown in figure [ schematic1 ] . the viscous stresses and pressure gradient due to flow in the narrow contact zone are dominant . for a newtonian fluid ,",
    "the stokes equations ( valid in the gap ) are reversible in time , @xmath2 , so that the transformation @xmath3 implies the transformations of the velocity @xmath4 and the normal force @xmath5 . in the vicinity of the contact region",
    "non - conforming surfaces are symmetric which implies that these flows are identical and therefore @xmath6 .",
    "elastohydrodynamics alters this picture qualitatively . in front of the slider",
    "the pressure is positive and pushes down the substrate , while behind the slider the pressure is negative and pulls up the substrate . as the solid deforms , the symmetry of the gap profile is broken leading to a normal force which pushes the cylinder away from the substrate .",
    "this picture applies naturally to soft interfaces which arise either due to the properties of the material involved , as in the case of gels , or the underlying geometry , as in the case of thin shells . in  [ thine ] we study the normal - tangential coupling of a non - conforming contact coated with a thin compressible elastic layer .",
    "if the gap profile prior to elastic deformation is parabolic in the vicinity of the contact , the contact is non - conforming .",
    "however , if a parabolic description prior to deformation is insufficient we refer to the contact as conforming ; _",
    "e.g. _ the degenerate case considered in  [ dsec ] . ",

    "[ 5 ] we treat the normal - tangential coupling of non - conforming contacts coated with a thin compressible poroelastic layer which describes a biphasic material composed of an elastic solid matrix and a viscous fluid ( biot 1941 ) . in  [ 7 ] we study the normal - tangential coupling of a non - conforming contact where one solid is rigid and the other is a deformable cylindrical shell . in  [ 8 ] we study a conforming contact : a journal bearing coated with a thin compressible elastic layer ; finally , in  [ 10 ] we treat the elastohydrodynamics of 3-dimensional flows using scaling analysis . figure [ summary ] provides an overview of the different geometries and elastic materials considered .",
    "our detailed study of a variety of seemingly distinct physical systems allows us clearly observe their similarities and to outline a robust set of features we expect to see in any soft contact . in all the cases",
    "studied the normal force = contact area @xmath7 characteristic hydrodynamic pressure @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the dimensionless lift and the softness parameter @xmath10 .",
    "tables [ t.1 ] and [ t.2 ] summarize our results for @xmath11 . increasing @xmath12 increases the asymmetry of the gap profile which results in a repulsive elastohydrodynamic force , _",
    "i.e. _ in the generation of lift forces .",
    "however , increasing @xmath12 also decreases the magnitude of the pressure distribution .",
    "the competition between symmetry breaking , which dominates for small @xmath12 , and decreasing pressure , dominant at large @xmath12 , produces an optimal combination of geometric and material parameters , @xmath13 , that maximize the dimensionless lift , @xmath14 . whether or not the normal force has a maximum depends on the control parameter : the normal force increases monotonically with the velocity , but has a maximum as a function of the effective elastic modulus of the system .",
    "this suggests that a judicious choice of material may aid in the generation of repulsive elastohydrodynamic forces thereby reducing friction and wear .",
    "we consider a cylinder of radius @xmath15 moving at a velocity @xmath1 and rotating with angular frequency @xmath16 and immersed completely in a fluid of viscosity @xmath17 as shown in figure [ schematic1 ] .",

    "we assume that the velocity and pressure field are two - dimensional and in the region of contact we use a parabolic approximation , valid for all non - conforming contacts , for the shape of the cylindrical surface in the absence of any elastic deformation .",
