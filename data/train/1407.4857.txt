    "filamentary molecular clouds , filaments , are now considered to be one of the evolutionary stages for the interstellar medium to evolve from molecular clouds to stars .",
    "analyzing dark globular filaments identified in optical images , @xcite pointed out that a filament would fragment into equally spaced condensations of gas and dust due to its gravity .",
    "indeed molecular line observations in the 1980s showed that filaments contain such condensations , dense molecular cloud cores , which are now known to be the immediate sites of star formation .",
    "this hierarchical structure is typically seen in nearby low - mass star forming regions such as the taurus molecular cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "recently our knowledge about filaments is significantly improved by systematic far - infrared ( fir ) imaging survey of the thermal emission from the interstellar dust using _ herschel _ space observatory ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "fir images taken with _",
    "herschel _ demonstrated that molecular clouds have ubiquitous networks of filaments which are highly likely produced through the interaction among gravity , interstellar turbulence and magnetic field .",
    "these observations clearly suggest that in general dense cores originate in the fragmentation process of filaments .",
    "another important results from the _ herschel _ observations is that filaments are omnipresent even in non - star forming cloud complexes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , theoretical studies have long discussed that molecular clouds collapse into sheet - like clouds which are formed through a compression process such as cloud - cloud collision , and that the sheet - like clouds fragment to filamentary clouds which will form dense cloud cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "considering balance between self - gravity and pressure gradient in radial direction of a cylinder , @xcite and @xcite found that a filament radially collapses if the line mass ( the mass per unit length ) of the filament exceeds the critical value of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath8 is the gravitational constant .",
    "stability of a cylinder in equilibrium against axial perturbations was studied for the isothermal incompressible cylinder composed of polytropic gas by @xcite : they found critical wave numbers against the axial fragmentation , but such an unstable cylinder can be stabilized by the axial magnetic fields of @xmath9 in the cylindrical coordinate .",
    "@xcite studied how stability of the compressible gas depends on the magnetic fields : the critical wavelength becomes longer for @xmath10 , whereas does short for @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite showed that critical wavelengths do not change with a uniform @xmath9 , but the growth rates of the unstable modes are suppressed , which differs from the conclusion drawn from the stodolkiewicz s calculations .",
    "as summarized in @xcite , all the studies showed that a filament breaks into  clumps \" with a separation of about 4 times the diameter of the cylinder .",
    "@xcite investigated the axial fragmentation and radial collapse of a cylinder in more detail ; they showed that merging and clustering of newly formed ",
    "clumps \" occur within a time scale of the fragmentation process of the natal filaments .",
    "although details remain a matter of debate , several unstable modes for the filament fragmentation are proposed by modern numerical simulations ( see reviews by e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these simulations may be categorized by the roles of magnetic fields and turbulence being considered . in principal , a complex interplay between magnetic fields plus turbulence and self - gravity of the cloud",
    "are believed to control the duration of core formation .",
    "one scenario is the",
    " fast mode \" with weak magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the opposite is the  slow mode \" with strong magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the difference between the  fast \" and  slow \" modes is whether or not a core forms within free - fall time of the natal gas .",
    "all the 3d simulations predict formation of network of filaments , but their complexity in velocity fields differs significantly ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "in general , the  slow mode \" expects quiescent ambient velocity field controlled by magnetic field , whereas the  fast mode \" predicts large scale supersonic velocity field .",
    "in other words , physical properties of the low density gas in the filament are considered to determine the formation mechanism and evolution of the dense cores .",
    "to link physical properties of such low density gas to our knowledge about collapse of a cloud core , we performed a detailed study of the dense cloud core  which is also known as l1082c ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this core contains an extremely young low - mass protostar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) whose circumstellar materials are probably responsible for the iras point source psc20503 + 6006 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the core has been identified by several molecular lines such as cs ( 21 ) @xcite ,  ( 10 ) ( caselli et al .",
    "2002 ; paper i ) ,  ( 10 ) , ( 1,1 ) , and ccs @xmath11 lines ( paper i ) .",
    "the core is located in the gf9 filament ( @xmath12 200 pc ) which is the ninth filament cataloged in @xcite . using the optical image",
    "@xcite estimated a total length of the filament to be 1.25 , corresponding to 4.4pc , although the filament curves as a portion of a shell .",
    "the filament contains almost equally spaced seven dense cores identified in the ( 1,1 ) lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "the physical properties of the filament were subsequently studied by near - infrared ( nir ) extinction @xcite , and optical and nir polarization observations @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite revealed that there exists a well aligned large scale magnetic field , and claimed that the field is almost perpendicular to the axis of the filament as the first order approximation .",
    "the protostar harbored in the  core has not developed an extensive molecular outflow ( bontemps et al .",
    "1996 ; paper i ) .",
    "this fact yields a rare opportunity to investigate core collapse conditions free from the disturbance by the outflow .",
    "our previous studies towards the core using the nobeyama 45 m telescope , cso 10.4 m telescope and the ovro mm - array showed that the  core has a radial density profile of  ( paper i ) .",
    "furthermore we detected blueskewed profiles in optically thick lines of  ( 32 ) , ( 10 ) , and hcn ( 10 ) , suggestive of gas infall motions all over the core ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "modeling the infall spectra , we pointed out that the core has undergone its gravitational collapse for @xmath13 years from an initially unstable state in paper iii .",
    "this is because the observed radial density profile was between those predicted in the runaway collapse scenario ( larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ; hunter 1977 ; the lph solution ) and the quasi - static inside - out collapse scenario @xcite , and because the observed velocity field inside the core has a reasonable consistency with that expected from the former scenario .",
    "however , it was impossible to investigate what had triggered the dynamical collapse of the core based on the data tracing only high density molecular gas [ @xmath14/  @xmath15 .",
    "clearly it required to unveil a close link between the initial conditions of the collapse and the physical properties of the low density ambient gas in the filament .",
    "we therefore carried out wide - field spectroscopic observations of the low density [ @xmath16/  @xmath17 gas in the filament using the nobeyama 45 m telescope .",
    "contrary to the previous papers which dealt with the dense core gas , this paper presents a detailed observational study of the low density natal filament gas surrounding the dense core .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows :  2 describes the observations ;  3 summarizes the results which were directly derived from the obtained spectra and maps of the co emission ;  4 describes our analysis of the excitation conditions of the co lines , the velocity structure of the filament gas and the calculations of column density ; ",
    "5 discusses the physical properties of the natal filament gas and a scenario of dense core formation ; and  6 gives a summary of this work .",

    "the answer to the former may be that such a spatial scale was set by the jeans length of the tenuous gas .",
    "as for the latter , we require that the dissipation time scales of the supersonic turbulence ( @xmath211 ) and the magnetic fields ( @xmath212 ) are less than the free - fall time ( @xmath213 ) of the gas traced by the  line . after addressing these issues",

    "subsequent numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with magnetic fields claim that the core formation must have completed within the global free - fall time of the natal cloud gas .",
    "a recent theoretical study by @xcite demonstrated that magnetic flux can be quickly removed from a cloud core by magnetic reconnection diffusion , which removes the magnetic flux through reconnection of the field lines by the co - existing turbulence ( not by ambipolar diffusion ) with a time scale as short as @xmath213 .",
    "contrary to these theoretical predictions , we propose a simple scenario that the supersonic turbulence and the magnetic fields locally decayed at the spatial scale comparable to the jeans length of the filament gas : @xmath214pc for @xmath2157.5 k and @xmath216  (  [ sss : hestimate ] ) .",
    "once the dissipation of the turbulence and the magnetic fields had occurred locally over a region with size scale of the jeans length , the region lost the support against self - gravity and contracted into a compact gas clump with 0.1 pc size , i.e. , a typical size of a low - mass star forming cloud core , by increasing its density as high as @xmath217 @xmath218 . with this number density ,",
    "the  ( 1,1 ) lines ( critical density of @xmath219 ) and the  ( 10 ) and  ( 10 ) transitions ( @xmath220 ) can be collisionally excited .",
    "because the latter higher density tracers were detected towards the  core , the above argument may favor the larger side of @xmath221pc .",
    "an alternative idea is that the core formed as a result of internal shock in the filament .",
    "however , this is unlikely because the shock compression with a mach number ( @xmath222 ) of @xmath223 (  [ ss : ambient ] ) would increase the gas density by a factor of @xmath222@xmath224 in the case of the j - type shock @xcite , i.e. , up to at most @xmath217  @xmath225 .",
    "clearly this is lower than the critical densities of the  and  lines .",
    "next , we examine whether the relation of @xmath226 holds or not . assuming that the core formed through the local dissipation of the supersonic turbulence with a spatial scale of @xmath227pc , the dissipation time scale is given by , @xmath228 for the natal component 1 gas .",
    "the other time scale to assess the core formation process is the free - fall time of , @xmath229 the two time scales are comparable to each other within large uncertainties , hence we conclude that @xmath230 holds .",
    "last , we attempt to give some constraints on the dissipation time scale of the magnetic fields ( @xmath212 ) . the upper limit of @xmath212 may be estimated by the ambipolar diffusion time scale ( @xmath231 ) for a spherical cloud with a radius of @xmath232 assuming a typical ionization degree in the ism [ see e.g. , eq.(10.5 ) in @xcite and eq.(2.51 ) in @xcite ] as , @xmath233 the lower limit of @xmath212 might be given by the time scale of the magnetic reconnection diffusion ( @xmath234 ) which should be comparable to or less than @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "hence we may have a very robust constraint of @xmath235 .",
    "we , however , speculate that @xmath236 is very unlikely because the eq.([eqn : t_ad ] ) assumes a constant density and a uniform magnetic field for a quiescent cloud .",
    "we therefore discuss that the formation of the  core was triggered by the local dissipation(s ) of the supersonic turbulence and probably the magnetic fields with the time scale comparable to @xmath213 , i.e. , the `` fast mode '' of star formation (  [ s : intro ] ) .",

    "neither indirect evidence for star formation , such as the presence of a point - like infrared source , masers , radio continuum emission , and a molecular outflow nor dense gas emission , such as ( 1,1 ) lines , has been reported towards the region ( * ? ? ?",

    "hence , the  ( 10 ) emission shown in figure [ fig : totmaps]c is the densest gas tracer detected towards the region .",
    "as mentioned above , we reject the possibility that the condensation represents a molecular outflow lobe driven by the protostar embedded in the  core for the following reasons .",
    "first , we did not detect any high velocity wing emission in the  spectrum towards the condensation ( see figure [ fig : spcomparison]b ) , which is evidence for a well - developed outflow .",
    "second , our recent interferometric observations of the  ( 32 ) line with the sma clearly demonstrated the presence of a compact ( @xmath238pc ) molecular outflow driven by the 3 mm continuum source in the  core ( * ? ? ? * furuya et al . in prep . ) .",

    "second , the object is massive ( @xmath255 ) enough to evolve towards a typical cloud core , regardless of an @xmath256 value (  [ sss : ostrikermodel_results ] ) . since the gf9 filament is likely gravitationally stable (  [ ss : ostriker_analysis ] and  [ ss : axial_fragmentation ] ) , we argue that the formation of the _ protocore _ was triggered by a collision between the components 1 and 2 . in this scenario ,",
    "the velocity width enhancement is interpreted as the sum of the turbulent motions in the two components and the radial velocity difference between them .",
    "the difference is estimated to be @xmath257  from figures [ fig : spcomparison]b and [ fig : mommaps]b , suggestive of a weak collision with @xmath222 @xmath258 .",

    "the mean @xmath353 calculated over whole the region is 3.5 k@xmath41  ( median @xmath28 3.5 k@xmath41 ) with standard deviation of 0.88 k@xmath41 . comparing figure [ fig : mommaps]a with figure [ fig : momerr]a , the uncertainties are about 60% with respect to the total intensities .      the first moment , which gives an intensity - weighted mean velocity , i.e. , centroid velocity ( @xmath354 ) , is defined by @xmath355 .",
    "this should be calculated by , @xmath356 therefore the uncertainty of @xmath354 is given by , @xmath357 here @xmath358 is the uncertainty in the lsr - velocity at the @xmath359-th channel , which can be replaced by the velocity resolution of the spectrometer , @xmath360 .",
    "since @xmath360 is generally represented by fwhm of the window function of the spectrometer ( @xmath361 ) , one has to divide it by @xmath362 to obtain the uncertainty in velocity , i.e. , standard deviation .",

    "the @xmath364 map seems fairly  flat \" compared with that of the @xmath353 .",
    "this is probably because estimating velocity width is principally sensitive to the dual terminal lsr - velocities at each spectrum , whereas @xmath353 is generally sensitive to the peak value of the spectrum .",

    "the @xmath371 map appears to be insensitive to the uncertainty in determination of the terminal lsr - velocities .",

    "<S> to study physical properties of the natal filament gas around the cloud core harboring an exceptionally young low - mass protostar , we carried out @xmath0 line observations of , , and  molecules using the nobeyama 45 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the mapping area covers @xmath1 of the whole filament . our  and  maps clearly demonstrate that the core formed at the local density maxima of the filament , and the internal motions of the filament gas are totally governed by turbulence with mach number of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the scale height of the filament to be @xmath3pc , yielding the central density of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis adopting an isothermal cylinder model shows that the filament is supported by the turbulent and magnetic pressures against the radial and axial collapse due to self - gravity . </S>",
    "<S> since both the dissipation time scales of the turbulence and the transverse magnetic fields can be comparable to the free - fall time of the filament gas of @xmath5 years , we conclude that the local decay of the supersonic turbulence made the filament gas locally unstable , hence making the core collapse . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we newly detected a gas condensation with velocity width enhancement to @xmath20.3 pc south - west of the  core . </S>",
    "<S> the condensation has a radius of @xmath20.15pc and an lte mass of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> its internal motion is turbulent with mach number of @xmath23 , suggestive of a gravitationally unbound state . </S>",
    "<S> considering the uncertainties in our estimates , however , we propose that the condensation is a precursor of a cloud core which would have been produced by the collision of the two gas components identified in the filament . </S>"
