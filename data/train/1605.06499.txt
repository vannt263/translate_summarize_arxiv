    "saturable absorption ( sa ) is an extreme nonlinear phenomenon that consists in the quenching of optical absorption under high - intensity illumination .",
    "this effect , which is an inherent property of photonic materials , constitutes a key element for passive mode - locking ( pml ) in laser cavities @xcite , where continuous waves are broken into a train of ultrashort optical pulses .",
    "most materials undergo saturable absorption at very high optical intensities , in close proximity to their optical damage threshold .",
    "currently , state - of - the - art semiconductor - based sa mirrors are routinely employed for pml lasers @xcite .",
    "however , these mirrors operate in a narrow spectral range , are poorly tunable , and require advanced fabrication techniques .    recently , carbon nanomaterials have emerged as an attractive , viable , and cost - effective alternative for the development of next - generation pml lasers .",
    "for example , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) undergo sa at rather modest light intensities , while their operation wavelength ( determined by the energy band gap ) can be manipulated by tuning their diameter @xcite .",
    "broadband operation has been demonstrated by using an ensemble of cnts with a wide distribution in diameter , at the expense of higher linear loss from off - resonance tubes @xcite .",
    "graphene overcomes this limitation thanks to its peculiar conical band structure , which gives rise to broadband resonant sa at remarkably low light intensity @xcite that can further be tuned by means of an externally applied gate voltage @xcite .",
    "graphene - based sa components have been used to achieve pml ultrafast laser operation @xcite , broadband tunability @xcite , and quality - factor switching @xcite .",
    "graphene multilayers have also been employed to generate large energy pulses @xcite and to achieve pml in fiber lasers with normal dispersion @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent theoretical investigations predict single - mode operation of random lasers by embedding graphene flakes in a gain medium @xcite .    despite the rising interest in sa of graphene for developing the above mentioned applications , a transparent and accurate theory of graphene sa is still missing .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that sa is inherently a non - perturbative phenomenon , which can not be accurately described by standard perturbative approaches used to calculate nonlinear graphene conductivities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , theoretical approaches relying on the boltzmann transport equation ( accounting only for intraband electron dynamics ) @xcite are inadequate to simulate sa of graphene , which arises due to the interplay of intraband and interband dynamics . in principle",
    ", sa can be modeled through time - domain integration of the single - particle density matrix equations in graphene nanoislands @xcite .",
    "however , the computational demand of this approach becomes unaffordable when modeling nanostructures with dimensions @xmath0 nm .",
    "then , in this regime , the single - particle massless dirac fermion ( mdf ) picture @xcite appears to be an appropriate theoretical environment for describing graphene sa .    in this article , we calculate intraband and interband contributions to sa of extended graphene by non - perturbatively solving the single - particle dirac equation for mdfs in the presence of an external electromagnetic field .",
    "we further investigate the dependence of the intensity - saturated graphene conductivity on doping , temperature , and optical frequency .",
    "interestingly , we find a remarkably low intensity threshold for sa , which is consistent with available experimental reports @xcite .",

    "while we find good agreement with an atomistic description of saturable absorption , including finite - size effects under nonresonant conditions , we anticipate that in general the enhanced near - fields associated with localized plasmons in graphene nanostructures should contribute significantly to reduce the saturation intensity and enlarge the modulation depth of sa .",
