    "the adler equation @xmath6 provides the simplest model of phase locking between a nonlinear oscillator and an external periodic drive . here",
    "@xmath7 is the phase difference between the oscillator and the drive , @xmath1 is the frequency detuning , and @xmath2 is the coupling strength .",
    "this equation first arose in connection with the phase locking of microwave oscillators @xcite , and has since found application in many other settings , including the depinning of charge - density waves @xcite , the entrainment of biological oscillators @xcite , and the onset of resistance in superconducting josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "a system governed by the adler equation can display only two types of long - term behavior @xcite . if @xmath8 , all solutions tend to a phase - locked state , where the response oscillator maintains a constant phase difference relative to the driver . on the other hand , if @xmath9 , all solutions exhibit phase drift , where the phase difference grows monotonically , with one oscillator periodically overtaking the other .",
    "the main limitation of the adler equation is that it treats the response oscillator as a system with only one degree of freedom , namely its phase .",
    "possible variations in its amplitude ( and any other degrees of freedom ) are ignored .",
    "this approximation is reasonable in the limit of weak driving ; in that case , the amplitude of the response oscillator typically equilibrates much more rapidly than its phase , and can therefore be treated as a constant in the subsequent analysis .",
    "but if the driving is not weak ( in some appropriate dimensionless sense ) , the dynamics can become complicated . in this paper",
    "we revisit a classic problem  the mathematical analysis of a solid - state laser with external injection @xcite  and explore it in regimes where amplitude effects become important and the adler approximation breaks down .",
    "our work was inspired by recent theoretical and experimental studies of amplitude effects in two mutually coupled solid - state nd : yag lasers @xcite . in those studies ,",
    "the lasers were equally coupled and identical , except for a slight relative detuning of their frequencies from some common cavity mode . for coupling strengths well above or below the locking threshold ,",
    "the lasers were found to exhibit the simple behavior expected from the adler approximation .",
    "however , as the coupling approached the locking threshold from below , the lasers showed a series of amplitude instabilities , culminating in a period - doubling route to chaos .",
    "these novel instabilities could not be explained by the adler approximation .",
    "instead the authors proposed the following mechanism . below the locking threshold , the lasers exhibit phase drift .",
    "if the time required for one full cycle of phase slip happens to be an integer multiple of the lasers relaxation period , the resulting subharmonic resonance might account for the observed instabilities .",
    "for the highly symmetrical case where the two lasers are assumed to have identical intensities and gains , this argument was proven to be correct by reducing the governing equations to those for a single , periodically modulated laser , where the subharmonic resonance mechanism was already known to occur @xcite .",
    "we wondered whether similar amplitude instabilities and chaos would occur in two coupled nd : yag lasers with _",
    "unidirectional _ coupling ( or equivalently , in a single nd : yag laser with external injection ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the qualitative argument about subharmonic resonances should still work . on the other hand",
    ", the equally - coupled case enjoys special symmetries that are not present in the unidirectional case . given the crucial role of the symmetry in the earlier analysis of erneux _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it seemed possible that some new effects might occur if the symmetry were broken .    as we will show below",
    ", the system with one - way coupling can indeed display some fascinating behavior near the unlocking threshold , but it differs from that seen in the equally - coupled case . in particular , we do not see a period - doubling route to chaos , nor any evidence of chaos at all . instead ,",
    "in a certain distinguished regime of parameters , we find a self - similar cascade of periodic windows and bifurcations . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this bifurcation scenario is novel",
    ".    it will be interesting to see whether this cascade can be detected experimentally for a laser in the appropriate parameter regime , as specified by our theory .",
    "it would also be gratifying to have a better theoretical understanding of the cascade itself .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the governing equations are given in sec .",
    "[ section_model ] . in sec .",
    "[ section_nondim_sym ] , we reduce the number of parameters by nondimensionalizing the equations and exploiting certain symmetries . by choosing a frame that co - rotates with the phase of the driver , we reduce the system to three coupled autonomous ordinary differential equations : one for @xmath7 , the phase difference between the laser and the drive , and one each for the dimensionless gain and amplitude of the response laser . fixed points of this reduced system correspond to injection - locked states of the original system .",
    "[ section_special_cases ] dispenses with the limiting cases of zero coupling or zero detuning where the dynamics can be analyzed straightforwardly .",
    "the analysis begins in earnest in sec .",
    "[ section_locked_states ] , where we derive criteria for the existence and stability of injection - locked states , and compare our criteria to those obtained in the usual adler approximation . in secs .",
    "[ section_weak_coupling ] and [ section_strong_coupling ] , we start to investigate what happens when locking is lost .",
    "we show perturbatively that for a broad range of parameters , the phase difference @xmath7 oscillates periodically , but the precise nature of those oscillations depends on the relative sizes of the dimensionless coupling , detuning , and stiffness of the system .    for a distinguished limit of parameters , described in sec .",
    "[ section_beyond_periodicity ] , the reduced system has complicated dynamics and undergoes the self - similar cascade of periodic windows and bifurcations mentioned above .",
    "[ section_a_singular_limit ] , we consider the system in the singular limit of zero stiffness . again , the cascade persists .",
    "based on the distinctive helical structure of the periodic orbits , we propose a mathematical mechanism underlying the cascade .",
    "it apparently stems from a codimension - two bifurcation in which a supercritical hopf bifurcation combines with a saddle - node infinite - period global bifurcation .",
    "we have no proof of this mechanism , but show that it correctly predicts the scaling laws found numerically in the bifurcation diagram .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of open questions .",
    "for solid - state lasers , as well as other class  b lasers with negligible linewidth enhancement factors , such as @xmath10 and ruby ( nmr ) lasers @xcite , the polarization relaxes rapidly compared to the electric field and the gain , and can therefore be adiabatically eliminated .",

    "the noise term @xmath23 models spontaneous emission , but for simplicity , we will consider only the noiseless case @xmath24 also , we will assume the media are linear , nonabsorbing and nondispersive and the coupling is dissipative so that @xmath25 and @xmath21 is real .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 in the first equation above is a symmetry - breaking coefficient measuring the extent of the feedback from the second laser to the first .",
    "the case of symmetric coupling ( @xmath27 ) has been analyzed in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus instead on the case of unidirectional coupling , i.e. , @xmath28 when @xmath29 the first laser is unaffected by the second , and hence we may regard it as a driver . assuming that this driving laser is pumped above its lasing threshold ( @xmath30 ) , it is easy to show that its amplitude and phase velocity settle down to constant values . specifically , the long - term state of the drive is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary constant , with constant gain @xmath33 .",
    "we assume these forms for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the rest of the analysis .",
    "thus , although we have formulated our study in terms of one solid - state laser driving another , the arguments and results we present hold for more general situations , such as a solid - state laser subjected to optical injection by other sources .    in a typical experimental setup using nd : yag lasers @xcite ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath16 are both positive and are of the orders @xmath36 s and @xmath37 s respectively .",
    "thus we have two vastly different time scales in the system .",
    "the detuning @xmath38 and the coupling @xmath21 are control parameters .",

    "we scale the equations governing the response laser by introducing the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath45 here @xmath46 is a stiffness parameter , typically @xmath47 in experiments , characterizing the vast difference in the time scales of the cavity round trip and fluorescence times in the response laser",
    ". the smallness of @xmath46 will be important in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 is the dimensionless pump strength of the response laser ; it often plays the role of a control parameter in what follows .",
    "the variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent dimensionless time and gain , respectively .",

    ", a steady state now means a state in which the phase difference between the two lasers , and not the phase @xmath64 of the second laser itself , is constant .",

    "there is a slight catch that one should be aware of .",
    "although we can assume @xmath71 without any loss of mathematical generality , there can still be physical consequences .",
    "for example , ( [ symmetry : k ] ) allows us to change the sign of @xmath2 , but at the cost of transforming an in - phase solution to an antiphase one .",
    "in fact , for certain systems of coupled lasers , @xmath2 can be negative @xcite .",
    "the special case @xmath72 with general @xmath1 is trivial : the driver and the response laser are decoupled .",
    "the reduced system ( [ receiver ] ) has a global attractor which is typically a periodic orbit , corresponding to phase drift between the laser and the drive . in degenerate cases ,",
    "the attractor can be a fixed point for ( [ receiver ] ) , e.g. , if there is also no detuning , or if the pump for the response laser lies below the lasing threshold .",
    "a more important special case is that of zero detuning : @xmath73 with @xmath74 then @xmath65 ( in - phase ) and @xmath75 ( antiphase ) are invariant manifolds @xcite , the former attracting all initial conditions except those on the latter , which is repelling .",
    "hence , so far as long - time behaviors are concerned , we can confine our attention to the flow restricted to the manifold @xmath76    on @xmath77",
