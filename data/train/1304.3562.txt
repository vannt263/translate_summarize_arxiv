    "the @xmath2 scalar theory is the simplest field theory with a continuous global symmetry , hence it has been widely used as a test to check new methods and analytic or numerical approximation schemes and its properties have been studied in detail .",
    "a very important property that is realized in this theory is the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global symmetry , a phenomenon that plays a central role both in quantum field theory and in the study of phase transitions in statistical physics . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath2 theory is the simplest model suitable for studying the universal properties of the qcd chiral phase transition at finite temperature , as well as other aspects of the chirally broken phase of quark models .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry is signaled by a nonzero value of the order parameter , which in the @xmath2 theory corresponds to a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of one component of the scalar field , and is typically associated with the appearance of massless excitations , the goldstone bosons@xcite , whose propagation induce infrared divergences that can substantially modify the mean field indications . the nature and the strength of the infrared divergences",
    "is strictly related to the number of euclidean dimensions @xmath16 of the system and in particular the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem , specifically formulated for spin models in@xcite and for quantum fields in @xcite , precludes the existence of a phase with conventional long range order , or spontaneous symmetry breaking in @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath16 increases , the infrared divergences become less severe and one has to resort to a suitable approximation scheme in order to deal with the infrared sector and extract finite answers for the physical observables .    a specific observable of the @xmath2 theory where the effect of the goldstone bosons is crucial ,",
    "is the mass of the field that acquires a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath18 , indicated as the longitudinal field .",
    "in fact , while it is possible to make use of general symmetry arguments to put constraints on the mass of the goldstone bosons associated to the other @xmath19 transverse fields , the same is not true for the longitudinal field . when the scalar theory is coupled to a magnetic field @xmath12 , the ward - takahashi identities , which relate the various correlation functions of the theory according to the symmetry properties of the problem , state that the inverse transverse susceptibility , defined as the inverse transverse propagator at zero momentum , is @xmath20",
    "then , when the magnetic field @xmath12 is turned off the ward - takahashi identities ensure the vanishing of @xmath21 , that is a vanishing goldstone bosons mass @xcite .    there is no such constraint on the inverse longitudinal susceptibility @xmath22 and therefore on the mass of the longitudinal field .",
    "however , the development of renormalization group techniques provided a deeper understanding of the infrared structure of the theory , and for this specific problem in @xmath23 , the relation @xmath24 is predicted @xcite .",
    "this scaling of the longitudinal mass has been repeatedly analyzed and confirmed in various approaches @xcite .",
    "however the behavior of this quantity in @xmath4 is different because in this case the power law scaling is replaced by much weaker logarithmic corrections . in @xcite a few arguments are presented to show that @xmath11 also vanishes in @xmath4 and in @xcite , where the two point function of the @xmath2 theory is studied in the framework of the functional renormalization group , a numerical investigation suggests a vanishing mass in @xmath4 .    the functional renormalization group is a reformulation of the wilsonian renormalization group @xcite , based on the infinitesimal integration of momentum modes from a path integral representation of the theory with the help of a wilsonian momentum cutoff .",
    "the resulting functional flow equations interpolate between the microscopic theory at short distances and the full quantum effective theory at large distances .",
    "various realizations of the functional renormalization group were developed and , among the most renowned , there are polchinski s and wetterich s formulations @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite @xcite ) . although this method is particularly suitable to analyze the critical domain and is especially powerful in the evaluation of the related critical exponents ( see for instance @xcite for an extended list of references ) , it also turns out to be an important tool in the study of nonperturbative features of the effective potential and effective action . for instance , the effective potential of the broken phase of scalar theories with its convex form ( this convexity property , @xcite , does not show up in perturbation theory@xcite and can only be recovered in some nonperturbative scheme @xcite ) has been largely investigated by means of renormalization group techniques @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in particular , an improvement on the determination of the effective potential in the ordered phase of the @xmath2 theory is considered in @xcite , where a numerical computation of the longitudinal propagator which includes the wave function renormalization , i.e. momentum dependent corrections to the local potential approximation , is performed in @xmath4 with the result that large wave function renormalization factors appear at least away from the critical region of the phase transition to the disordered phase .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the study of the longitudinal mass in the broken phase of the @xmath2 theory , in the framework of the functional renormalization group , generalizing the case @xmath4 examined in @xcite to the range @xmath25 , however not including momentum dependent corrections that are not crucial for our purpose and therefore limiting ourselves to the local potential approximation .",
    "we first analyze the problem in the simpler large @xmath6 limit case and compare the results with those obtained at lowest order in the @xmath3 expansion .",
    "then we extend our investigation to small values of @xmath6 , also confronting the results with the renormalization group improved effective potential as obtained from the callan - symanzik equations . with this compared study",
    ", we gain analytic control on the problem which allows to overcome the limits of the numerical analysis , that are particularly evident in proximity of @xmath4 , and finally we get a more complete picture of this specific issue . in sec .",

    "although the infrared cutoff is not much larger than for @xmath9 , the numerical fluctuations are stronger and make the deep infrared region ( @xmath129 ) inaccessible .",
    "the corresponding curve ( dashed ) does not show any bending toward the origin and it is not possible to establish from the plot whether or not the second derivative of the potential vanishes at @xmath41 and @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below by applying standard renormalization group techniques , such problem is related to the fact that power law corrections are replaced by smoother logarithmic corrections in @xmath4 , which turn out to be more difficult to treat numerically . for better understanding",
    "this point , we now proceed to the study of the theory at finite @xmath6 and for @xmath16 close to @xmath161 , in the framework of the callan - symanzik approach .    to this end , it is convenient to rewrite the potential as @xmath162 where we have introduced the rescaled field @xmath163 @xmath164 and the `` temperature '' @xmath165 @xmath166 is normalized in such a way that it vanishes at the critical value @xmath167 that separates the symmetric and the broken phase .",
    "it is understood that @xmath168 includes corrections with respect to eq .",
    "( [ mcritninf ] ) which is obtained in the @xmath169 limit .",
    "we are specifically interested in the broken phase and therefore we take @xmath170 .",
    "we also recall that the coupling @xmath171 has dimension @xmath172 , expressed in units of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath79 , and the corresponding dimensionless coupling is defined as @xmath173 . by defining @xmath174 as the logarithm of the scale @xmath175 , ( we avoid to use the same notation of the running momentum @xmath93 adopted for the functional renormalization group flow equations due to the different roles of the two scales ) , the @xmath176-functions of the various parameters in the potential , as given by perturbation theory at lowest order , are @xmath177 : @xmath178 note that @xmath27 at lowest order has no correction and therefore no @xmath104 dependence .",
    "a word of caution concerning the usual way of obtaining these @xmath176-functions has to be said : the fact that the @xmath2 model in the broken phase contains more than one scale requires a more careful treatment , @xcite , and we shall come back again to this point . from eqs .",

    "below , the dependence of the various variables on the parameter @xmath104 is explicitly displayed while it is omitted for the bare variables , which correspond to the value @xmath181 .",

    "( [ dpotimpr ] ) , reads @xmath193    let us now go back to a somewhat delicate point .",
    "the model under investigation has two characteristic scales @xmath194 and @xmath195 , respectively associated with the mass of the longitudinal field and with the goldsone bosons mass : @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "if these two scales are comparable , then the usual procedure to compute @xmath190 , that we have outlined above , is essentially correct . on the other hand , when these scales are significantly decoupled , new aspects , that we have overlooked up to now , appear @xcite .",
    "it is important to observe that some perturbative diagrams contributing to the longitudinal two point function are affected by infrared divergences due to the loops of goldstone bosons and a reliable estimate of @xmath198 is obtained only when the goldstone contributions are included in the evaluation of the renormalization group functions .",
    "indeed , the goldstone bosons have zero mass in absence of external source and , when @xmath12 is turned on , their square mass is proportional to @xmath12 , while the longitudinal field starts with a nonvanishing bare mass at @xmath181 and , at least in the @xmath30 case , its renormalized square mass is proportional to @xmath13 when @xmath12 approaches zero .",
    "therefore , in the evaluation of the @xmath176-function we expect that the deep infrared region is dominated by the smaller scale @xmath195 , so that the contribution of the larger scale @xmath194 can be neglected .",
    "accordingly , we select @xmath199 with @xmath200 and eqs .",
    "( [ beta],[betam ] ) are replaced by @xmath201 consequently eq . ( [ betat ] ) becomes @xmath202 so that its solution in ( [ tausol ] ) now becomes @xmath203 , while the factor @xmath204 has to be replaced by @xmath19 in eqs .",
    "( [ betaphi],[usol],[lambdasol ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ xisol ] ) is formally unchanged .",
    "since our analysis concerns the infrared region corresponding to large negative @xmath104 , at this point it is essential to recall the different behavior of the theory in @xmath23 and @xmath4 , due to the presence , in the former case , of the wilson - fisher fixed point which merges with the gaussian fixed point when @xmath4 .",
    "therefore we have to treat the two cases separately and we start by considering @xmath23 .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) one finds the wilson - fisher fixed point @xmath205 ( that vanishes when @xmath206 ) and the scaling of @xmath207 and @xmath186 near this fixed point is @xmath208 @xmath209 from the infrared behavior of the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ couinfra ] ) , one can write for the corresponding dimensionful quantity , after neglecting subleading terms : @xmath210    now we can focus on the inverse susceptibility which , due to the rescaling of @xmath163 in eq . ( [ newfi ] ) , is @xmath211 and it can be read from eq .",

    "incidentally , we notice that the particular choice of the goldstone mass as the infrared scale and of the @xmath176-function in ( [ beta1 ] ) , has selected only the goldstone bosons contribution , which is also dominant in the large @xmath6 approximation . in this sense , it is not surprising to find the same result in eqs .",
    "( [ sadagain ] ) and ( [ confronto2 ] ) .",
    "finally we analyze the problem in @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath218 , where the coupling is dimensionless ( @xmath219 ) and , as is well known and as observed in the @xmath30 case in sec [ largen ] , the divergences associated to the @xmath220 poles are typically replaced by logarithms of the renormalization group scale .",
    "in addition , the main difference with respect to the problem in @xmath84 is that the wilson - fisher and the gaussian fixed points coincide in @xmath4 , @xmath221 , and this in turn implies that , when the ultraviolet cutoff is removed , one ends up with a noninteracting theory . in practice",
    "we can observe this triviality property directly from the coupling constant , as obtained by integrating eq .",

    "( [ dspotd4 ] ) shows that the inverse longitudinal susceptibility , as obtained from @xmath233 , depends only on the ratio of the renormalization group scales @xmath79 and @xmath175 through the logarithm @xmath104 .",

    "it is also straightforward to realize that in the large @xmath6 limit , eq . ( [ dspotd4 ] ) reproduces eq.([susc ] ) with the loop integral displayed in eq .",
    "( [ iduequattro ] ) .",
    "therefore , our conclusion in @xmath4 is that @xmath234 vanishes as @xmath235 when the external source is turned off , exactly as it happens in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "however it must be remarked that , because of the logarithmic dependence of our observable on the ratio of two scales , the limit @xmath63 can not be disentangled from the limit @xmath236 and this means that the results obtained in the limit @xmath63 are those of a noninteracting theory .    before finishing",
    "we would like to investigate the possibility of observing a nonvanishing longitudinal susceptibility in @xmath4 . according to the above analysis",

    "if @xmath175 is taken much larger than @xmath238 and @xmath239 introduced above , then the problem related to the presence of two different infrared scales is no longer present and we can use the @xmath176-functions in eqs .",

    "we studied the longitudinal susceptibility in the broken phase of the @xmath2 theory , both in the simpler case of the large @xmath6 limit and in the general case of finite @xmath6 . in this analysis we compared the results of three different approaches , namely the leading contribution of the @xmath3 expansion ,",
