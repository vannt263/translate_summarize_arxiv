    "the current paradigm of sunspot formation is based on the idea of buoyant rise of flux tubes from the base of the solar convection zone to the surface of the sun @xcite .",
    "this process is parameterised in the widely used flux transport dynamo models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the form of a non - local @xmath0-effect where the strong ( around @xmath1 g ) toroidal magnetic fields in the tachocline give rise to poloidal fields at the surface .",
    "this poloidal magnetic field is then advected by meridional circulation back to the tachocline where it is amplified .",
    "these concepts face several theoretical difficulties , however , including the storage and generation of strong magnetic fields beneath the convection zone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the stability of the tachocline in the presence of such strong fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore , observations of sunspot rotation suggest that they might be a shallow phenomenon possibly occurring within the near surface shear layer @xcite . this requires a new mechanism to form sunspots .",

    "this effect leads to the negative effective magnetic pressure instability ( nempi ) where even uniform , sub - equipartition , magnetic fields can form flux concentrations .",

    "our results have shown that convection can lead to magnetic flux concentrations by a mechanism that may be related to nempi .",
    "a possible alternative mechanism is magnetic flux expulsion that has previously been found to be responsible for a segregation of magnetised and unmagnetised regions in large aspect ratio convection simulations with an imposed _",
    "vertical _ magnetic field @xcite .",
    "our results appear to be similar , except that here we have an imposed _ horizontal _ magnetic field . in that respect",
    ", it is useful to mention recent simulations of @xcite , who inject a 1000 g horizontal magnetic field at the bottom of their simulated convection domain and find after some time the emergence of a bipolar magnetic field at the surface . in their case the reason for the formation of flux concentrations is argued to be the downdrafts of the deeper supergranulation pattern , which tend to keep the magnetic field concentrated into flux bundles at the bottom of their open domain . our present simulations do not capture this effect , because they are probably not deep enough and our domain is impenetrative and perfectly conducting at the bottom , excluding therefore their mechanism as a possible explanation .",
    "of course , another important difference between our simulations and those of @xcite is the presence of a radiating surface in their case .",
    "this might enhance magnetic flux concentrations formed through local suppression of convective energy flux by magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this might well be an important effect that needs to be studied more thoroughly .",
