    "for example colloidal hard spheres have been studied intensively , where addition of nonadsorbing polymer induces an attraction , whose strength and range can be controlled @xcite .",
    "the case of short - ranged attractions has turned out especially rich .",
    "colloidal particles interacting with already moderately strong short - ranged attractions can form metastable amorphous solids which exhibit exceedingly long life times .    depending on the colloidal density and attraction strength different types of metastable arrested",

    "aggregation phenomena proceed far from equilibrium at low density , resulting in tenuous solids , i.e. gels . at even lower density",
    ", the aggregation process leads to cluster formation and aggregation @xcite .",
    "the connection between repulsion and attraction driven glass transitions at high densities has been understood within a microscopic theoretical framework , namely mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite . yet",
    ", the mechanisms of solidification at intermediate attraction strengths and low to intermediate densities are still not completely understood @xcite . especially the interplay of equilibrium phase transitions and aggregation effects is presently under scrutiny @xcite .",
    "another aspect that has been considered at low densities is the existence of weak long - ranged repulsive interactions ( barriers ) between the particles , that may induce density modulations ( or non - percolating clusters at low density ) , and thus prevent solidification for some parameter ranges @xcite .",
    "small wavevector scattering peaks indicative of mesoscale correlations have also been observed and employed to characterize the cluster or gel structures @xcite .",
    "their observation in equilibrium systems with long - ranged barriers is expected because these systems show tendencies to micro - phase separate and to form interconnected structures of clusters and voids @xcite . yet , such long distance correlations and clusters of finite size were also observed in systems where barriers supposedly are absent and there presumably have a nonequilibrium origin and arise from phase separation and/or aggregation and coarsening @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium origins of the low angle scattering peaks also were suggested by the observation of their time evolution @xcite .",
    "alternatively , to reach gelation from the fluid , liquid - gas phase separation can be prevented setting a maximum number of bonds per particle @xcite or total number of bonds in the system @xcite . in these cases",
    ", gelation is directly connected to percolation , and the low-@xmath0 modes facilitate the relaxation of the whole system , due to the lack of stiffness ( only two to four neighbours are allowed on average ) . at higher density , such modes are expected to be less important than collective relaxations , and a general theory should account for both relaxation mechanisms .",

    "the underestimate of @xmath36 at low @xmath0 suggests that mct underestimates the contribution of the repulsion driven mechanism of vitrification in the present system .",
    "apparently , in the simulatated system attraction driven and repulsion driven glass transition compete , and both transition lines are close . our quantitative mct calculations ( erroneously ) position the system too far from the repulsive transitions . within mct",
    ", a higher order singularity appears in the vicinity of the merging of the two glass transition lines , signalled by @xmath110 .",
    "indeed , a larger @xmath33 exponent is observed in the simulations compared to the mct calculations , which glassify due to bond formation solely .",
    "the criterion for quantitatively defining the @xmath20-relaxation times is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we chose the definition _",
    "q(_q)=xf_q , for the @xmath20-relaxation times , where in the theory @xmath111 and in the simulation @xmath112 .",
    "the latter choice was required because of the limited simulation time , but incurs larger corrections to the values of @xmath113 arising from faster relaxation processes .",
    "the different definitions are reconciled in the following comparison by normalization of the times , @xmath114 , which brings out the @xmath0-dependence .",
    "the @xmath20-relaxation times @xmath113 generally vary in phase with the nonergodicity parameter @xmath34 and the structure factor @xmath1 , a phenomenon often referred to as de  gennes narrowing .",
    "repulsion driven glass transitions display the largest @xmath113 at the principal peak in @xmath1 , which indicates that the cage formed by the particle s next neighbors induces the dynamical arrest . here on the contrary , the slowest relaxation takes place either ( i ) at the prepeak , when the barrier causes void formation , or ( ii ) for @xmath91 in model ( a ) without barrier on approaching the phase separation region .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] gives @xmath20-relaxation times calculated from the above definition and normalized to their value at @xmath115 .",
    "in mct for models with barrier ( b , c ) one finds that the slowest modes are connected with the prepeak . in model",
    "( a ) @xmath113 decreases by more than a factor 2 at this @xmath0 , when the prepeak in @xmath1 is eliminated .",
    "the simulations , however , do not allow to check this difference , but only show that the slowest modes are those with @xmath116 . nevertheless , the different dynamics at small @xmath0 has no further impact on the dynamics at larger @xmath0 ; in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the @xmath113 for all models agree at large @xmath0 , where the power - law @xmath117 is also tested .",
    "it holds nicely in the simulation data , with the von schweidler exponent obtained from the fitting of the correlation functions : @xmath118 .",
    "mct explains @xmath113 for larger wave vectors quite well , though small systematic deviations emerge because of the difference in the von - schweidler exponents between simulation and calculations , models ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "let us note in passing that the asymptotic behavior @xmath119 holds earlier in the polydisperse mct calculation ( c ) ( not shown ) , then in the monodisperse ones ( a ) and ( b ) , where deviations are still noticeable in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . this appears to support the probabilistic interpretation of the kohlrausch law within mct @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the void structure is completely enslaved by the bond formation on local length scales . even though the dissolution of the void structure is the slowest process , there s no evidence for a significant influence of the voids on the local dynamics .",
    "local bond formation proceeds identically in systems ( b , c , d ) with barrier and void pre - peak in @xmath1 , and in system ( a ) without barrier and void - correlation peak in @xmath1 .      for an inclusive check of the results beyond asymptotic expansions we compare mct - correlators for a finite distance from the critical point obtained as full solutions to the equations ( [ eq2]-[eq4 ] )",
    "the fact that in simulations only finite distances from the transition point are accessible necessitates this comparison .",
    "we used the monodisperse model ( b ) , because it provides reasonable nonergodicity parameters and contains the barrier like the simulation ( d ) .",
    "the wave vectors for the mct - correlators have been chosen to be as close as possible to the simulation values ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the separation parameter for the mct calculation was adjusted so that the structural relaxation can be compared most succinctly .",
    "the correlators from simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] show a two - step relaxation process with the final @xmath20-relaxation from the plateau of height @xmath34 .",

    "the simulation data exhibit damped vibrational motion on short time scales .",
    "this is neglected in , which therefore can describe the dynamics only at later times .",
    "it is only this structural relaxation that mct addresses and thus the modelling at short times is done as simply as possible .",
    "we do not attempt to ( a ) include vibrational motion , ( b ) capture the separation of short time and long time dynamics quantitatively , but ( c ) only consider the shape of the structural relaxation in the following comparison .",
    "the results highlight the strong q - dependence of the structural relaxation .",
    "in addition a strong stretching , i.e. non - exponential @xmath20-relaxation is also observed . according to different von - schweidler exponents of @xmath118 in the simulation and @xmath121 in mct",
    "the simulation results appear somewhat more stretched .",
    "nevertheless , the local dynamics , where the bond formation can be directly seen , is well described by mct .",
    "amplitude and shape of the @xmath20-process are rather well captured , as would become even clearer if simulations closer to the transition could be performed .",
    "but for the dynamics on larger scales only qualitative statements can be made .",
    "glass transitions within mct are bifurcation points in the equations of motion of the structural relaxation .",
    "while the equilibrium structure of the considered glass forming fluid changes smoothly , the dynamics slows down significantly and a metastable glassy structure comes into existence .",
    "the bifurcation transitions of mct contain universal signatures , like von schweider s law that is the origin of the non - exponentiality of the ( final or @xmath20- ) structural relaxation .",
    "non - universal amplitudes , like the critical glass form factor @xmath21 or the critical amplitude @xmath36 entering von schweidler s law , contain the information in mct about the physical mechanisms causing arrest .",
    "we considered the wavector dependence of @xmath21 , @xmath36 , and of the @xmath20 relaxation times @xmath113 in order to discover the origin of glassy arrest in colloidal dispersions of particles with short ranged attractions at intermediate packing fractions .",
    "the study was motivated to gain insight into the connection between attraction driven glass transitions at higher densities and colloidal gelation at lower ones .",
    "we looked at simulations of a model system where particles interact additionally with a weak long - range repulsive barrier .",
    "structure factors @xmath1 directly taken from simulations were used as the only input to mct , in order to study the importance of the mesoscale gel - like structure indicated by a pre - peak in @xmath1 .",
    "it arises in the simulations from the long - ranged repulsive barrier that suppresses gas - liquid demixing .",
    "this mesoscale peak is the slowest mode in the system , as the void - structure takes the longest time to dissolve .",
    "yet , we find that the existence of the pre - peak in @xmath1 does not affect mct calculations for the attraction driven glass transition .",
    "the latter is caused by local bond formation apparent in all quantities at large wavevectors .",
    "we conclude that the mesoscopic mode is enslaved to the formation of physical bonds , and that this local process is not affected by the larger - scale heterogeneities of the system .",
    "mct quantiatively captures local bond formation but somewhat overestimates the stability of the glass on larger length scales .",
    "still , the mechanism of arrest in the dispersion at intermediate density is the attraction driven one discovered in mct at higher densities .",
    "the role of polydispersity in mct calculations was also considered .",
    "averaged structure factors of polydisperse systems miss the large @xmath0-tail indicative of short ranged attractions .",
    "this arises from negative interference of the various contributions from particle - pairs with different contact distances .",
    "while this prevents the use of averaged @xmath1 from polydisperse systems to capture an attraction driven glass transition , it does not imply that the vitrification mechanism in polydisperse systems is different .",
    "rather the actual polydisperse system exhibits bond formation , and can be described quantitatively within mct using the appropriate @xmath1 from , for example , the corresponding monodisperse system .",
