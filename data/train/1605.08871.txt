    "phase - change materials ( pcms ) constitute a class of semiconductors characterized by two allotrope phases , a crystalline and an amorphous one , having distinct physical properties @xcite .",
    "such materials , discovered in the late 60s @xcite , are already used in rewritable optical discs , such as dvds and blu - ray discs .",
    "they are also very promising to realize fast , non - volatile electronic memories ( pcram ) .",
    "because of the variety of pcms a rigorous chemical definition is absent , although design schemes for some ternary compounds are well established @xcite . a practical requirement for a pcm , as underlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the switching between the two phases must be reversible , efficient and repeatable , due to obvious technological reasons .",
    "benchmark pcms are alloys composed of ge , sb and te  along the so called gete - sb@xmath0te@xmath1 pseudobinary line  thus denoted as `` gst '' @xcite .",
    "although the potential for applications of pcms spans from dynamic memories @xcite to display fabrication @xcite , at present the limits for the use of gsts are the speed and the power required to switch between the two phases , being respectively of approximately 100  ns and 100  @xmath3w @xcite .",
    "hence a huge effort is devoted to find new solutions , and nanoscale structures seem to offer significant advantages .",
    "@xcite . following this trend ,",
    "phase - change heterostructures had been produced , showing to function with improved performances @xcite . here",
    "we focus on chalcogenide superlattice ( csl ) films made by high temperature deposition of alternating nm - size layers of gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "+ prior to investigate the properties of csls , we review the charge carrier transport @xcite and the structural @xcite properties of gst compounds .",
    "the crystal phase of gsts is characterized by a strong dependence of the resistivity upon annealing treatment @xcite .",
    "in fact , by increasing the temperature , the system undergoes an insulator - metal transition ( imt ) at 275@xmath4c , due to disorder reduction .",
    "@xcite density functional theory calculations showed that the insulating state is caused by the localization of charge carriers in vacancy - rich areas , and the transition to the metallic state happens when vacancies reconfigure into ordered layers @xcite .",
    "the presence of vacancy layers in the high temperature annealed phase of gsts was proven by high - resolution tem and electron diffraction @xcite .",
    "+ the lattice structure of the crystalline ge - sb - te based csl is similar , by growth design , to the high temperature gst phase . as mentioned before csl",
    "are formed by high temperature deposition  although lower than the imt  of gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 layers .",
    "one might consequently expect that the as grown structure is characterized by well separated layers of pure gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "recent tem and exafs experiments @xcite have shown that the structure is indeed layered , but gete is not actually pure since it is intercalated into a sb@xmath0te@xmath1 quintuple layer .",
    "please note that the vacancy layers , when two - dimensionally extended , are labelled van der waals gaps .",
    "@xcite the similarity between the high - temperature - annealed gsts @xcite and the csls , besides the structure , is corroborated by the measured resistivity of the latter that decreases with increasing temperature , suggesting a metallic type conductivity @xcite . nonetheless , it is not obvious whether also the dielectric properties of csls are analogous to those of gst compounds @xcite .",
    "for instance one of the peculiar characteristics of crystalline gst is the high value of the static dielectric constant , which is evidence of resonance bonding .",
    "@xcite measuring the dielectric function of cls will provide useful information either about the structure , or about the bonding character of the compounds .",
    "the dielectric function of csls can be estimated by transmittance experiments , probing simultaneously the character of the interband transition and the density of free electrons .",
    "+ in this article we compare the optical transmission behaviour of films grown by dc magnetron sputtering ( ms ) , with those grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) used as reference samples .",
    "transmission experiments are performed on films with thickness below 100  nm , to guarantee high film quality , and at normal incidence , to simplify the interpretation of the results .",
    "our analysis supports recent results showing that the gete layers are not isolated but intercalated within a sb@xmath0te@xmath1 layer @xcite .",
    "we explain how intermixing modifies the conductivity of the film .",
    "in addition we show that it is possible to control the electronic transport properties of the csl not only by an annealing treatment , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also by means of a specific stack design .",
    "in fact , as we will see , the csl conductivity depends on the layer sequence , giving a new design pathway for the control of the material properties .",
    "csl samples are grown by ms and mbe on sb - passivated si(111 ) surfaces of intrinsic 500  @xmath3m - thick wafers above 210 @xmath4c .",
    "ms samples are films of 15 repetitions of [ gete(@xmath5  nm)/sb@xmath0te@xmath1(3  nm ) ] , where @xmath6 . for the mbe samples we use the intermediate n=2 case .",
    "ms annealed ( ann ) samples  at 250  @xmath4c for 30 minutes  are distinguished from the ms as deposited ( asd ) ones .",
    "transmission experiments in the energy range 0.061.23  ev were collected at sissi beamline on the elettra storage ring @xcite by a @xmath7 spectrometer .",
    "the fitting function is determined for multilayer thin films optics @xcite .",
    "figure [ tall ] shows the absorbance @xmath8ln@xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively the sample and the substrate transmission , as a function of the incoming photon energy for all the samples .",
    "the data present few physically relevant features , common to all samples and regardless of growth technique and layer stack . in particular , we observe i ) the onset of an absorption edge below @xmath20.15  ev , increasing by decreasing the photon energy ; ii ) a minimum between 0.15 and 0.3  ev , and iii ) a broad feature rising above @xmath20.4  ev , increasing towards higher energies . in analogy to ref .",
    "@xcite we associate the low frequency absorption component to free drude electrons , and the higher energy broad band to the onset of the valence - to - conduction absorption .",
    "the absorption modulation of the data , particularly visible on the ms 33 annealed sample , is an artefact due to multilayer interference effects .",
    "we account for interference effects by calculating the transmission coefficient @xmath12 including reflection losses .",
    "+        the film dielectric function ( df ) is modelled with a sum of a drude and a single tauc - lorentz ( tl ) oscillator term @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 the photon energy , @xmath16 the plasma frequency and @xmath17 the scattering time .",

    "a typical fit result is shown in figure [ fitres]a .",
    "the related df is plotted in figure [ fitres]b .",
    "the misfit between the experimental and calculated data is due to si phonons ( the peak at @xmath20.3  ev ) and probably to the small contribution of interference effect from the substrate that have not been accounted for . in all cases",

    "we first consider the tl component of the df , whose @xmath22(ev ) , @xmath24(ev ) , @xmath28 parameters are given in table [ tab_par ] .",
    "the tauc gap lays below 0.5  ev .",
    "@xmath24 , representing the maximum of the semiconductor optical absorption , has an average value of approximately 1.5  ev .",
    "this value matches quite well with the experimentally obtained value of crystalline gete @xcite and gst @xcite .",
    "moreover , the computed low frequency value of the real part of the tl df , @xmath28 , has an average value above 20 .",
    "this @xmath28 high value is typical of the crystal phase of pcms @xcite , suggesting the presence of resonance bondings . in summary",
    "the tl component of our csl is approximately independent on the annealing treatment .",
    "the fact that annealing does not affect the as - deposited ( asd ) structures might suggest that the films undergo an immediate reorganization during growth , which is more effective than annealing itself .",

    " just half with respect to copper at 300 k @xcite  the plasma frequency consistently decreases with the increase of the stacking sequence 13 - 23 - 33 , both for the asd and ann samples .",
    "the csl electron density @xmath29 , derived from @xmath16 , is shown in figure [ fin_par ] .",
    "a decrease of @xmath27 is observed with the increase of nominal gete content in the film .",
    "also the conductivity @xmath30 shows the same trend .",
    "this behaviour can be explained either by an increased defectivity , by a lower conductivity of gete with respect to sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , or by an increase of the optical gap . yet , since the comparison acts within the ms grown samples , we expect the same growth quality and  consequently  the same concentration of defects .",
    "in addition , pure gete has a _ higher _ free carrier concentration with respect to sb@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite thus , the expected trend with stack sequence 13 - 23 - 33 should be opposite than what observed .",
    "it follows that variations of @xmath27 must result from changes of the electronic band structure .",
    "+ the intermixing of gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 layers rises the material optical gap , causing a reduction of the free carrier concentration .",
    "figure [ scheme]a sketches the band diagrams for gete , sb@xmath0te@xmath1 and gsts , in analogy to refs @xcite .",
    "the diagrams emphasize the differences between the optical gaps and the presence of degenerate electrons in the conduction band .",
    "both gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 have a low tauc gap @xmath310.1  ev @xcite , while for gst @xmath32 0.4  ev @xcite . in first approximation",
    "the tauc gap of the csl depends on the constituents volume fraction and on their respective gaps .",
    "if gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 are ideally separated inside the csl the film is expected to have small gap and high carrier concentration , independent of the relative content of the two elements .",
    "if instead gst is formed by the intermixing of the two , the material tauc gap must rise .",
    "the more gst is formed , the higher the tauc gap ( approaching eventually the value of gsts ) and the lower the number of degenerate electrons .",
    "this is consistent with the carrier density of the sequence 13 - 23 - 33 , shown in figure [ fin_par ] .",

    "we extrapolate the trend observed in the present csl to a stack of general thickness , having ( gete)@xmath33/(sb@xmath0te@xmath1)@xmath34 as repeat unit , where @xmath35 .",
    "this formula is applicable to all csl structures developed so far in literature : i ) superlattice - like ( ssl ) pcms , with @xmath36 @xcite ; ii ) interfacial phase change materials ( ipcm ) , with @xmath37 @xcite ; iii ) the case @xmath38 , studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and iv ) our csls .",
    "we assume our stack sequence corresponds to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , since 1  nm of gete along the ( 111 ) direction is composed by at least two bilayers @xcite .",
    "the conductivity of a csl in the general case is calculated assuming that gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 layers intermix at the interface , forming gst as shown in figure [ scheme]b . in particular , we consider that the interface layer consists of a maximum of 2 sb@xmath0te@xmath1 and 4 gete layers , resulting in 1 thick layer of gst . then , given the bulk conductivities @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xcite , the film conductivity is calculated as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the volume fraction of the @xmath46-th component ( gete , sb@xmath0te@xmath1 and gst ) . + in figure [ nm]a , the conductivity measured for all our samples",
    "is compared with the conductivity @xmath47 , as a function of gete layer units @xmath5 . in agreement with experimental observations",
    "the conductivity decreases from @xmath48 down to @xmath49 .",
    "the strikingly different behaviour of the `` non - intermixing '' case , calculated simply via eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) with @xmath50 , demonstrates once more that intermixing effects must be accounted for when working with superlattice structures . + for completeness the dependence of @xmath51 is shown in figure [ nm]b .",
    "interesting to note the conductivity has a minimum along the diagonal @xmath52 up to @xmath53 that corresponds to the maximum possible volumetric formation of gst , hence forming the material with the lowest conductivity . for higher values of @xmath5 and @xmath54 the conductivity approaches the `` non - intermixing '' case , as also visible for high values of gete units in figure [ nm]a .",
    "in this work we deduce important structural details of crystalline gete / sb@xmath0te@xmath1 superlattice deposited at high temperature ( @xmath55210  @xmath4c ) by studying the film interband transmission .",
    "we observe that , at the interface between the gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 deposition layers , a crystalline gst compound is formed already during growth .",
    "gst , having higher band gap with respect to its constituents , lowers the number of degenerate conduction electrons . by varying the respective number of building block layers it is possible to control the percent of gst in the film , and consequently the film conductivity , with no need of annealing treatment . in the future",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the dynamics deriving from the intermixing and ion diffusion by depositing two single thick layers of gete and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 and studying the interface effects at different deposition and annealing conditions .",
