    "possible ways to satisfy these increasing demands are to allocate more spectrum and improve spectral efficiency . since spectrum is rather scarce , especially below 6 ghz @xcite , mobile network operators , which we will refer to as hereafter , will need schemes that utilize spectrum more efficiently .",

    "the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) is in the process of standardizing d2d communication for 5 g networks @xcite .",

    "there have been many studies on spectrum sharing for d2d communication , e.g. , @xcite among others , but only single - operator d2d is taken into account . spectrum allocation for inter - operator d2d based on a non - cooperative game model",
    "was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "provided that the game is concave and every satisfies the diagonal dominance solvability condition ( dsc ) , there exists a unique ne ( nash equilibrium ) and the sequence of best responses converges to it from any initial point .",

    "the efficiency of the non - cooperative game solution is evaluated for different utility designs , weighted sum and weighted proportional fair .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the system model and problem formulation are presented . in section iii , the non - cooperative game is established with the utility and constraint designs , the existence of a ne , the introduction of the iterative algorithm to reach a ne , and the relation between the uniqueness and local stability properties of a ne . in section iv ,",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of the iterative algorithm are provided , and a distributed algorithm always converging to a unique ne is proposed . in section",
    "v , we demonstrate the spectrum sharing gain .",
    "section vii concludes this paper .",
    "in this section , we consider the system model and problem formulation used in @xcite , applicable to increasing the co - primary spectrum usage opportunities for 5 g mobile operators .",
    "we consider @xmath0 enabling d2d communication .",
    "an may have two types of d2d users : firstly , intra - operator d2d ( a.k.a .",
    "intra - d2d ) users , i.e. , the two ends in the d2d pair have subscriptions with the same ; secondly , and inter - operator d2d ( a.k.a .",
    "inter - d2d ) users .",
    "a d2d pair can communicate in a d2d manner ( a.k.a .",
    "d2d mode ) or via the nearby serving ( a.k.a .",
    "cellular mode ) .",
    "d2d communication in unlicensed bands would suffer from unpredictable interference .",
    "because of that , at this moment , licensed spectrum seems to be the way forward to enable d2d communication , especially considering safety - related scenarios such as vehicle - to - vehicle communication . in the licensed band",
    ", either dedicated spectrum can be allocated to the d2d users ( a.k.a .",
    "d2d overlay ) or d2d and cellular users can be allocated over the same resources ( a.k.a .",
    "d2d underlay ) .",
    "an intra - d2d underlay has a higher spectrum reuse factor and it may result in high spectral efficiency with appropriate interference management .",
    "an intra - d2d overlay enjoys higher spectral efficiency than the case where d2d communication is not enabled , and less implementation complexity than the underlay case @xcite . in an inter - d2d underlay",
    ", cellular users may suffer from inter - operator interference , and in order to resolve it , information exchange between the might be needed . due to the fact that may not be willing to reveal proprietary information",
    ", we believe that , at the first stage , the inter - d2d overlay scheme would be easier to implement @xcite .",
    "each utilizes the total available spectrum divided into multiple sub - bands . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume a fixed and equal bandwidth for sub - bands to easily determine the total available sub - bands .",
    "the number of available sub - bands are equally allocated among all users for fairness of resource usage , or may be based on a set qos per user .",
    "we assume a fair share of resources among users .",
    "in particular , in , whether or not an may contribute an equal amount of spectrum to the shared band , the performance accessible to inter - d2d users in d2d mode should be proportional to the bandwidth allocated to the spectrum pool under the fairness rule  @xcite . in inter - d2d and intra - d2d modes ,",
    "each user accesses a sub - band with a certain medium access probability . in cellular mode ,",
    "the resource allocation is controlled by the bs which schedules the users in a round - robin manner , and thus the corresponding spectrum resource is shared equally .",
    "accordingly , the average numbers of users over sub - bands allocated for each transmission mode are the same .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we evaluate the performance of the for different intra - d2d densities for 1 , @xmath1 , while we fix @xmath2 and @xmath3 to be equal to the cellular user density .",
    "we depict the spectrum fractions contributed by the in fig .",
    "[ numerical : fig : asym : a ] , and assess the sum rate gain for the as compared to the case without inter - d2d support in fig .",
    "[ numerical : fig : asym : b ] .",
    "the gain is computed as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the average rates of cellular users and intra - d2d users for the case without inter - d2d support , evaluated after setting the user fraction in inter - d2d mode @xmath7 and the d2d spectrum allocation factor @xmath8 , with the d2d spectrum allocation factor @xmath9 given the constraints @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in general , asymmetric would contribute unequal amounts of spectrum .",
    "all experience performance gain .",
    "one can see that symmetric achieve around @xmath12 gain .    for densities",
    "@xmath13 , 1 who has less network load contributes the higher fraction of spectrum to the spectrum pool , see fig .",
    "[ numerical : fig : asym : a ] , since it has enough capacity to satisfy its own constraints .",
    "hence , the opponents enjoy more benefit from than 1 does , see fig .",
    "[ numerical : fig : asym : b ] .",
    "the inter - d2d user rate is larger than intra - d2d user rate , @xmath14 , since the total amount of spectrum committed to the shared band is larger than the one allocated to intra - d2d users in d2d mode , @xmath15 .",
    "however , due to the decreasing fraction of inter - d2d users , @xmath16 , the gain obtained by 1 decreases along with the densities @xmath13 .",
    "meanwhile , for density around @xmath17 , all come to have same network load and thus 2 and 3 who benefited by contributing less spectrum fractions contribute more , and 1 contributes less spectrum .",
    "all achieve equal gains at @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , for densities @xmath19 , 1 contributes only a small fraction for the signaling channel .",
    "other still benefit by contributing some fraction , i.e. , @xmath20 in overlay and underlay , respectively .",
    "one can see that using the underlay principle would contribute more spectrum for inter - d2d communications , and experience less performance gain , under the same constraint target values with the intra - d2d overlay approach .",
    "while cellular and intra - d2d users suffer from the mutual interference and less average spectral efficiency , the underlay scheme appears to achieve higher rates for cellular and intra - d2d users due to wider spectrum allocation .",
    "this enables an to have enough capacity satisfying its own constraints .",
    "thus , an contributes more spectrum and achieves less gain compared to the no spectrum sharing case where a higher rate is already obtained in underlay compared to the overlay scenario .",
    "[ numerical : fig : asym : c ] shows the efficiency of the non - cooperative solution , the ratio of the utility sum at the ne point obtained by algorithm 1 compared to the utility sum at the pareto - optimal point , @xmath21 .",
    "a socially optimal solution can be viewed as one type of fair allocation .",
    "the weighted utility function allocates resource more fairly between two groups , e.g. , intra - operator users and inter - operator users .",
    "an with this utility , who might be able to increase its own utility by allocating spectrum to the intra - d2d users or to the inter - d2d users , tends to avoid choosing an extreme value in his own strategy space for preference maximization .",
    "such a rational manner in p.f utility function brings more fairness among , and thus yields a result closer to the optimal one .",
    "the obtained ne efficiency can be used as a lower bound for a two - operator non - cooperative spectrum sharing game , since increasing the number of leads to the ne efficiency compromise .",
    "we studied spectrum allocation for d2d communication considering different mobile network .",
    "we modeled the interactions between as a non - cooperative game .",
    "we showed that the formulated game has a unique ne if every has a concave utility on the box - constrained region and all eigenvalues of derivatives of iterative response process are less than unity .",
    "uniqueness can be identified in a distributed manner .",
    "the non - cooperative algorithm based on the s best response might not converge to the ne due to myopically overreacting to the responses of the other . to resolve this instability , we proposed a strategy update algorithm with a proper smoothing parameter . using the update we were able to study the system and draw useful remarks .",
    "asymmetric contribute an unequal amount of spectrum for d2d support .",
    "an may contribute a small amount of spectrum , but still the opponents may have the incentive to contribute more due to the d2d proximity gain .",
