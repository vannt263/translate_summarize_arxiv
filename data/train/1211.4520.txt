    "applications of artificial neural networks in content addressable ( associative ) memory have attracted much attention in the last few decades @xcite .",
    "hopfield - type networks are among the most popular models of artificial neural networks for studying content addressable memory . according to hopfield s original idea",
    ", the privileged regime to store information has been fixed point attractors , however experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that cycles are used to store information and chaotic dynamics appears as the background regime composed of these cyclic `` memory bags '' .    in general",
    ", the storage of pattern sequences is one of the most important tasks in both biological and artificial intelligence systems .",
    "a sequence containing repetitions of the same subsequence is said to be complex @xcite , and cyclic patterns ( or cycles of patterns ) are one of the important classes of such sequences . in",
    "animal nervous systems , cyclic patterns of neuronal activity are ubiquitous and partially responsible for generating and controlling rhythmic movements such as locomotion , respiration , swallowing and so on",
    ". neural networks that can produce cyclic patterned outputs without rhythmic sensory or central input are called central pattern generators ( cpgs ) . while in some lower level invertebrate animals detailed connectivity diagrams among identified cpg neurons have been experimentally determined , the anatomic structure of cpg networks in most higher vertebrate animals including human beings remain largely unknown .",
    "according to yuste @xcite , the network connectivity problem , i.e. experimentally identifying the connectivity diagram of biological neural networks , is one of the four basic problems that have to be solved to fully understand a biological neural network .",
    "however , recent experimental observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggested that cpgs may be highly flexible , some of them may even be temporarily formed only before the production of motor activity @xcite .",
    "this makes experimentally identifying the architecture of cpgs very difficult . as indirect approaches to solve the network connectivity problem , observable movement features such as symmetry etc . have been used to infer aspects of cpg structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". in this paper , we study the network connectivity problem for storing binary cyclic patterns . given an arbitrary binary cyclic pattern , we ask whether there exists a network whose architecture allows to produce it , and if there exists one , then how the cycle determines the network structure .",
    "while the main motivation for our study is the storage of cycles in continuous - time hopfield - type networks , this question is independent of the specific dynamics of the individual neurons the network is composed of .    in both discrete and continuous asymmetric variants of hopfield - type networks , the storage and retrieval of sequences including cycles of binary patterns",
    "have been investigated @xcite , and biologically plausible learning rules such as hebb s rule , the pseudoinverse rule and their variants with and without delays have been used . in this paper , we follow @xcite and use continuous - time hopfield - type networks as models to study the relation between cyclic patterns and the architecture of the networks constructed from them . in addition to the simple dynamics of single neurons , another advantage of hopfield - type networks is that they deal with binary states . in neurophysiology",
    "it is well known that both cpg neurons and cortical neurons show bistable membrane behaviors , which are commonly referred to as plateau potentials ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or up - down states .",
    "accordingly , a sequence of the binary states @xmath2 and @xmath3 traversed by a single neuron in a hopfield - type network can be interpreted as a sequence of up and down states , respectively .",
    "while simulations of networks constructed using hebbian learning rules have been shown to be qualitatively consistent with experimental recordings @xcite , it is well known that hopfield - type networks with hebbian learning rules do not perform well when the patterns to be stored are correlated which is usually the case in practice @xcite . to avoid this problem ,",
    "a pseudoinverse learning rule was introduced by amari @xcite , and in the hopfield framework by personnaz et al . and kanter et al .",
    "it has been suggested that the pseudoinverse learning rule and its variants may take key roles in the associative perception of human faces in the human cortex @xcite and the encoding of location information in the rat hippocampus @xcite .",
    "recently , tapson and schaik proposed an algorithm referred to as opium ( online pseudoinverse update method ) for computing the pseudoinverse , and showed that the pseudoinverse learning rule is plausible as a physiological process in real neurons @xcite .",
    "since the pseudoinverse method gives an exact solution of the network connectivity problem if a solution exists @xcite , we use this method to construct networks for storing binary cycles .    although the pseudoinverse rule and its variants @xcite extend to more general cases , most investigations in discrete - time hopfield - type networks characterized or were implemented for cycles or sequences of linearly independent patterns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an approach to storing cycles of correlated as well as linearly independent patterns in continuous - time hopfield - type networks has been proposed by @xcite . in this study ,",
    "a successfully retrieved cycle is revealed as an attracting limit cycle in the network dynamics , but the question for which cycles the corresponding network connectivity problem admits a solution was not addressed .    in our study , a cycle is defined by a @xmath4-matrix , @xmath0 , of binary states , where @xmath5 is the number of neurons in the network and @xmath6 is the length of the cycle .",
    "the network connectivity problem associated with a cycle @xmath0 can be formulated as follows : find a real @xmath7-matrix @xmath8 such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is related to @xmath0 by a cyclic permutation of the columns .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to study the existence and properties of solutions of this equation along with the structural features of the corresponding cycles , and the network topologies associated with them . if a solution @xmath8 exists , we call the cycle @xmath0 admissible and construct @xmath8 using the pseudoinverse method .    while the main motivation for our study is the storage of binary cycles in continuous - time hopfield - type neural networks , the question whether a given cycle is admissible is independent of the particular network - model .",
    "for the discrete - time hopfield - type networks studied by @xcite and @xcite , @xmath8 can be used directly as connectivity matrix . for the continuous - time hopfield - type networks considered in section 2.1 , we follow the approach of @xcite and represent the connectivity matrix as a weighted sum of @xmath8 and another matrix @xmath11 , that serves to store the individual patterns in @xmath0 as fixed points . to demonstrate that our approach also works for more complicated neuron - models , we introduce in section 2.2 a single - compartment neuron model that exhibits up - down states and show an example of a successfully retrieved cycle .",
    "our main objective is to analyze and classify the structural features of admissable cycles @xmath0 and the topology of the networks constructed from them .",
    "a basic result is that if and only if the discrete fourier transform of @xmath0 contains exactly @xmath1 nonzero columns , then @xmath0 is admissible .",
    "our approach to classify cycles is based on the decomposition of the row vectors of @xmath0 into disjoint subsets corresponding to different loops created by cyclic permutations of the rows .",
    "if the cycle is admissible , each of these loops is associated with an invariant subspace of the row space , @xmath12 , of @xmath0 under cyclic permutations .",
    "this row - decomposition leads naturally to a classification of cycles into simple cycles , separable composite cycles , and inseparable composite cycles .",
    "simple cycles contain rows from a single loop only .",
    "composite cycles contain rows from at least two disjoint loops , and for each loop the neurons corresponding to the loop vectors in @xmath0 are identified with a cluster , which in turn corresponds to an indecomposable invariant subspace of @xmath12 under cyclic permutations if @xmath0 is admissible .",
    "two clusters are directly connected if their subspaces intersect nontrivially , and they are connected if they are part of a chain of directly connected clusters .",
    "a network constructed from a simple admissible cycle has only one cluster , and we show that the network topology is a feedforward chain with feedback to one neuron if the loop vectors in @xmath0 are all cyclic permutations of each other . for special simple cycles , there is only one feedback and the network topology simplifies to a ring .",
    "networks constructed from separable composite cycles decompose into completely isolated clusters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the pseudoinverse learning rule is introduced in the framework of continuous - time hopfield - type networks .",
    "additionally , in order to demonstrate that the pseudoinverse learning rule can be applied to other networks as well , networks of spiking neurons with plateau membrane potentials and postinhibitory rebound are introduced , and simulations showing the successful retrieval of a prescribed cycle are presented . in section 3 ,",
    "the general admissibility criterion in terms of the discrete fourier transform of the cycle matrix is formulated and proved , and the relation of admissible cycles with cyclic permutation groups is discussed .",
    "based on the structural features of the invariant subspaces of the row space of an admissible cycle , in section 4 , admissible cycles are classified into simple cycles , and separable and inseparable composite cycles , and for each type of cycles a corresponding admissibility condition is derived . in section 5 , the topologies of networks constructed from different types of admissible cycles are studied , and in section 6 implications of the results presented in this paper are discussed .",

    "assuming that all neurons are identical , normalizing the neuron amplifier input capacitance and resistance to unity and neglecting external inputs , the governing equations are , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the firing rate of the @xmath19-th neuron and @xmath20 is the connectivity matrix .",

    "the matrix @xmath8 is given by @xmath837 and shows that neurons 1 and 2 form an excitatory / inhibitory pair , whereas neuron 3 acts excitatory on neuron 1 . without this third neuron the oscillations of neurons 1 and 2 as required by the first two rows of @xmath0",
    "could not be implemented , since the submatrix of @xmath0 consisting of these rows is not admissible .",
    "in this paper we have studied the structural features of admissible cycles and their relation to the topology of the corresponding networks . while our main motivation was the storage of cycles in continuous - time hopfield - type networks ,",
    "the results apply to other networks as well , including the discrete networks considered by @xcite and @xcite and networks of spiking neurons exhibiting up - down states . in particular , we have formulated and proved conditions on binary cyclic patterns that guarantee the existence of a network with connectivity satisfying the transition conditions imposed by the cycle , independent of the specific dynamics of the individual neurons .",
    "we showed that if and only if the discrete fourier transform @xmath195 of a cycle matrix @xmath0 contains exactly @xmath197 nonzero columns , where @xmath838 , then a network can be constructed from @xmath0 with the pseudoinverse learning rule .",
    "based on the structural analysis of the invariant subspaces of the row space of @xmath0 , the admissible cycles have been classified into simple cycles , and separable and inseparable composite cycles .",
    "this classification was based on the decomposition of the row space of @xmath0 into subsets corresponding to disjoint loops .",
    "the admissibility of a cycle implied that all vectors of a loop are in the row space of @xmath0 if @xmath0 contains some of these loop vectors .",
    "if no loop - space associated with @xmath0 is a subspace of another loop - space ( the generators are essential generators ) , we have identified for each loop the neurons associated with the loop vectors contained in @xmath0 with a cluster . for general admissible cycles",
    "the clusters are connected , and the connectivity of the clusters depends on the intersections of their loop - spaces .",
    "two clusters are directly connected if their indecomposable invariant subspaces intersect non - trivially .",
    "they are `` indirectly '' connected if they are part of a chain of directly connected clusters .",
    "if an admissible cycle is separable , the clusters are completely isolated . in this case",
    "each cluster corresponds to a simple cycle associated with a generator of @xmath0 .",
    "if the simple cycle is minimal and consecutive , the cluster has the form of a feedforward chain from the last neuron to the first neuron with feedbacks to the last neuron from the other neurons .",
    "if in addition the length of the cycle , @xmath6 , is even and the rank of the generator is @xmath691 , we generically find a ring structure with excitatory or inhibitory connection from the first neuron to the last neuron , but we can not exclude that special loops with these properties exist for which no ring - structure occurs .",
    "if the simple cycle is minimal but non - consecutive , we find more than one feedforward chains .    regarding non - minimal simple as well as composite cycles",
    ", it would be interesting to find equivalence relations similar to those of @xcite , and @xcite , relating networks constructed from non - minimal cycles to networks constructed from minimal cycles .",
    "for example , similar to the linear - threshold ( lt ) networks @xcite , we may consider the hopfield - type network ( [ eq : hopfieldnetwork05 ] ) with delay in a different but closely related form , @xmath839 where @xmath840 and @xmath841 .",
    "while ( [ eq : hopfieldnetwork05 ] ) is invariant under arbitrary permutations of the neurons , it can be shown that ( [ eq : hopfieldnetworkdefnscalarnew ] ) is invariant under a larger class of linear transformations that allows to define broad equivalence relations among admissible cycles . in comparison to ( [ eq : hopfieldnetwork05 ] ) , the only disadvantage ( [ eq : hopfieldnetworkdefnscalarnew ] ) may have is that it is less biologically plausible , because in biological neural networks neurons usually are coupled with each other through chemical synapses , which means that the firing rates instead of the membrane potentials of the presynaptic neurons change the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron .    in networks constructed from composite cycles ,",
    "the complete isolation of the clusters of separable cycles means that each cluster has its own subcycle .",
    "the issue is that we can not expect the different subcycles to synchronize , preventing the network to traverse the cycle states in the order prescribed by the cycle matrix . in this case",
    "an additional synchronization mechanism must be introduced to enforce synchrony .",
    "such a mechanism can be in the form of a small coupling among the clusters or through an external periodic input acting as pacemaker .",
    "the generation of cyclic patterns in animal nervous systems is associated with cpg networks , and the storage and retrieval of cyclic patterns in such networks are fundamentally important .",
    "recent experimental observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggested that cpgs may be highly flexible .",
    "as some animal movements , such as swallowing , gastrointestinal motility etc . , often require the coordination of several functional groups of muscles , different cpgs controlling these muscles subsequently form during different phases of the movements .",
    "such cpg networks consist of pools of neurons that can function in several cpgs involved in the organization of various motor behavior .",
    "recently , in order to account for the flexibility of memory representation observed in neurophysiological experiments , @xcite studied the effect of saliency weights on the memory dynamics in lt neural networks .",
    "they showed that the saliency distribution determines the retrieval process of the stored patterns , and that a nonuniform saliency distribution can contribute to the disappearance of spurious states . using our results on the relation between the structural features of a cycle and the network topology , a mechanism similar to the variable saliency factor introduced by @xcite into lt networks",
    "may be used to combine different cpgs in one network , and to study how a sequence of several cycles determines a changing network structure .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions , and alexander hulpke and chuck anderson for helpful discussions .",
    "the first author was supported in part by a summer graduate research fellowship ( 2012 ) awarded by the department of mathematics at colorado state university .",
    "we summarize here the basic properties of the cyclotomic polynomials used in sections 3 - 5 , for details see @xcite .",
    "the cyclotomic polynomial of order @xmath6 is defined by @xmath842 , @xmath463 , where the @xmath843 encompass all primitive @xmath6-th roots of unity , that is , @xmath844 and @xmath845 if @xmath846 .",
    "the total number of such primitive roots is given by _",
    "euler s totient function _ , @xmath847 . if @xmath848 with distinct primes @xmath849 is the prime factorization of @xmath6 , then @xmath850 .",
    "the important property of the cyclotomic polynomial is that they have integer coefficients and are irreducible over the rationals .",
    "moreover , @xmath676 is the minimal polynomial for each root @xmath843 , and the product of all @xmath851 for which @xmath699 is a factor of @xmath6 and @xmath852 is @xmath853 .",
    "the only cyclotomic polynomials of odd degree are @xmath854 and @xmath855 , all @xmath676 for @xmath662 have even degrees as their primitive roots are all complex .",
