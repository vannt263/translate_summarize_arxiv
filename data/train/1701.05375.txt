    "converters ( tdcs ) are used in various fields , including high - energy physics .",
    "for example , in the atlas experiment  @xcite , the muon momentum is measured with monitored drift tube chambers based on tdcs with a bin size of 0.78  ns , which are implemented in application - specific integrated circuits  @xcite .",
    "moderate field - programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) make implementing tdcs with a nanosecond or small bin size possible  @xcite . in many cases , the bin size of tdcs based on the propagation delay time must be calibrated to cope with the delay time dependence on the temperature as well as the location and routes of the delay units . on the other hand ,",
    "the tdcs in this study , which are based on multi - phase clocks managed by a highly reliable clock manager integrated in the fpga , do not require bin size calibration .",
    "implementation of tdcs in fpgas provides flexibility because logics can be modified to deal with unexpected problems and changes in the experimental conditions .",
    "data transfer at a rate of gigabits per second can be handled with the robust transceivers integrated in fpgas . in this study , an eight - channel tdc with a variable bin size down to 0.28  ns",
    "is implemented and tested in a xilinx kintex-7 fpga  @xcite .",
    "the fpga is xc7k325t-2ffg900 and has a speed grade of -2 .",
    "this study extends the demonstration described in  @xcite by further analysing and interpreting the data as well as measuring the power consumption .",
    "additionally , the potential to extend the number of channels to 256 is discussed .",
    "[ fig : tdc ] shows a block diagram of the tdc , which was designed to measure the timing of both the leading and the trailing edges of the input signal .",
    "the fine time measurement is based on free - running counters ( ` fine time counters ' ) , which are designed with a multisampling scheme and quad phase clocks  @xcite .",
    "each quad phase clock has a frequency one quarter of the fine time counters .",
    "the quad phase clocks are produced from an external reference clock at the clock manager integrated in the kintex-7 fpga , where the supported maximum frequency is 933  mhz .",
    "an external reference clock with a 110  mhz frequency corresponds to that of the quad phase clocks of 880  mhz and a 0.28-ns bin size .",
    "the difference in the lengths of the divided input signal paths ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tdc ] ) is crucial for the tdc performance . in this study , the locations of the first four d - type flip - flops in each channel",
    "were constrained so that they are close to each other .",
    "the data from the fine time counter includes a three - bit time count and a one - bit identifier of the leading and the trailing edges .",
    "these data are combined with the data from a fourteen - bit coarse time counter , and stored in a channel buffer .",
    "the channel buffers for all channels are scanned , and the data is transferred to a buffer with a five - bit channel identifier . then the data are read out one by one . the dynamic range for a bin size of 0.28  ns is 37  @xmath0s .",
    "the dynamic range can be extended by changing the number of bits for the coarse time counter .",
    "[ fig : demonstrator ] shows a picture of the demonstrator , which consists of a motherboard and a daughter card .",
    "the motherboard is compatible with the versatile backplane bus standard vme  @xcite .",
    "it has a kintex-7 fpga ( type is xc7k325t-2ffg900 ) .",
    "although either an onboard 40-mhz quartz oscillator or a lemo coaxial connector  @xcite can provide the system clock , this study employed the latter .",
    "additionally , the output from the fpga can be read through the backplane or a gigabit ethernet with a transmission control protocol processor implemented in the fpga ( sitcp )  @xcite , but the latter was used .",
    "the daughter card has eight lemo coaxial connectors as signal inputs .",
    "the input compatible with the nim fast negative signal  @xcite is converted into a 3.3  v lvcmos signal  @xcite with texas instruments sn65lvds348pw  @xcite . then the signal is transferred to the fpga on the motherboard .",
    "the signal and external reference clocks are from the pulse generator agilent 81150a  @xcite .",
    "the standard deviation of the time difference between the leading edges of the two synchronised pulses from the pulse generator is 30  ps . the performances of bin sizes of 0.78  ns , 0.39  ns , and 0.28  ns , which correspond to the external reference clock frequencies of 40  mhz , 80  mhz , and 110  mhz , respectively , were evaluated .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the results for the 0.28-ns bin size are shown .",
    "although the leading edges were evaluated , the trailing edges should produce similar results since common clocks and d - type flip - flops are used .",
    "the differential nonlinearity @xmath1 is defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the bin index , @xmath5 is the bin size for bin @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is the designed bin size . to evaluate @xmath1 ,",
    "the time difference of the leading edges between the signal and external reference clocks was measured .",
    "multiple bins were investigated by scanning the time difference between the signal and external reference clocks with a 33-ps step size ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dnl ] ) . a periodic structure with a cycle of four bins was found .",
    "the maximum magnitude of the measured @xmath1 is 0.6 .",
    "the delay @xmath7 before the first d - type flip - flop for each divided input signal path @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) was estimated by a xilinx vivado design tool .",
    "based on the estimated delay , the bin size @xmath10 for each quad clock phase @xmath8 was calculated as @xmath11 a cyclic relation of @xmath12 was used to calculate @xmath13 .",
    "table  [ tab : dnl_bin_110mhz ] shows the measured and calculated bin sizes for a channel .",
    "[ fig : bin_size ] shows the distribution of the difference between the measured and calculated bin sizes for all 32 quad clock phases of the 8 channels .",
    "the difference is o(0.01 )  ns , implying that the main source of the periodic structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : dnl ] is the difference in the divided input signal paths . as a channel - level measure of @xmath1 , the deviation @xmath14 is defined for each channel by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total number of bins .",
    "[ fig : dnl_rms ]  shows the result of the measurement of @xmath14 . the obtained value , which varies between 0.060.14 , depends on the channel .",

    "an eight - channel tdc with a variable bin size down to 0.28  ns was implemented and tested in a xilinx kintex-7 fpga .",
    "the tdc is based on a multisampling scheme with quad phase clocks synchronised with an external reference clock .",
    "the measured time resolution for a 0.28-ns bin size is 0.080.10  ns , depending on the channel .",
    "the performance has a negligible dependence on the temperature .",
    "the number of channels can be increased up to hundreds of channels without significantly changing the tdc performance .",
    "implementation of tdcs in fpgas increases the flexibility to modify logics .",
    "this feature is extremely advantageous when coping with unexpected problems or changes in the experimental conditions .",
    "if a stable reference clock is available such as in high - energy physics experiments , the tdc in this study does not need to be calibrated .",
    "consequently , fpga - based tdcs should be useful in fields requiring subnanosecond resolution and multiple channels .",
