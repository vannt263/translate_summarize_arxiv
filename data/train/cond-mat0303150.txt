    "there is a growing interest in the nonextensive generalization of the conventional boltzmann -gibbs statistical mechanics .",
    "tsallis thermostatistics ( tt ) is one of these generalization attempts [ 1 ] and in this study , we generalize the maier - saupe theory ( mst ) [ 2 ] , a mean field theory especially used in nematic liquid crystals , and the variation of the order parameter of paa ( p - azoxyanisole , a nematic liquid crystals ) versus temperature is investigated within tt formalism .",
    "mst fails to explain the experimental data for some of the nematics and paa is one of these nematics .",
    "it is well known that boltzmann - gibbs statistics ( bg ) seems to fail for the systems , ( i ) with long range microscopic interactions , ( ii ) with long range memory effects and ( iii ) which evolves in a multifractal space - time .",
    "therefore there is a tendency for nonextensive formalisms .",
    "it is seen in the literature that from 1988 up to present days , tt not only has been applied to various concepts of thermostatistics [ 3 - 20 ] , but also achieved to solve some physical systems where bg statistics is known to be inadequate . amongst them , stellar polytropes [ 21 ] , levy - like anomalous diffusions [ 22 ] , two - dimensional euler turbulence [ 23 ] , solar neutrino problem [ 24 ] , velocity distributions of galaxy clusters [ 25 ] , fully developed turbulence [ 26 ] , electron - positron and other high - energy collisions [ 27 ] and anomalous diffusion of hydra viridissima [ 28 ] could be mentioned .",
    "the axioms of tt are the following 1 ) the entropy of the physical system is defined by @xmath0    where k is a constant , p@xmath1 is the probability of the system in the i th microstate , w is the total number of configurations and q is the entropic index ( q@xmath2 ) which is a measure of the nonextensivity of the system .",
    "it is important to note that if q@xmath3 ,  then s@xmath4 , which is the well known shannon entropy .",
    "\\2 ) q - expectation value of an observable o is given by @xmath5    which again recovers the conventional expectation value when q=1 .",
    "an approach that has proved to be useful in developing a theory of long range orientational order and the    where v is the molar volume , a is a constant independent of pressure , volume and temperature ,  @xmath6  is the angle between the long molecular axis and the preferred axis , s is the order parameter and given by @xmath7    the internal energy per mole is @xmath8    where b = a/(ktv@xmath9 ) , ( a=13@xmath10  erg.@xmath11 , v=225 @xmath12forpaa ) , n is the avogadro number , t is temperature .",
    "the partition function for a single molecule is given by @xmath13    so that the entropy is @xmath14 .\\ ] ]    then the helmholtz free energy is @xmath15 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the condition for equilibrium is given by @xmath16    or @xmath17    this equation is satisfied when @xmath18    the theoretical curve for s versus t could be determined from ( 8) namely the equilibrium condition .",
    "in the frame of tt , the generalized partition function is written as @xmath19 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 .",
    "the average value of cos@xmath21 is @xmath22    for the sake of simplicity , we replace cos@xmath6 with x@xmath1 . in eq.(10 ) , let us write @xmath23 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left [ 1+(1-q)\\frac{bs}{2}(3x_{i}^{2}-1)\\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting eq.(11 ) into eq.(10 ) , we obtain @xmath24 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}dx_{i}}{\\int_{0}^{1}% \\left [ 1+(1-q)\\frac{bs}{2}(3x_{i}^{2}-1)\\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}dx_{i}}.\\ ] ]    to integrate the terms in eq.(12 ) , the series expansions of exp@xmath25 is written  in terms of q and then the leading two terms are taken : @xmath26   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{8}\\exp \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}bs(3x_{i}^{2}-1)\\right ] b^{2}s^{2}(3x_{i}^{2}-1)^{2}(1-q).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , we have solved equation ( 12 ) and plotted s = f(t ) curve for various values of q. in figure 1 , the order parameter versus temperature for various values of q are presented . as seen from fig.1 ,",
    "gmst is in good aggreement with the experimental data for q=0.988 .",
    "it seems that with a small departure from the standard theory one could be able to explain some of the experimental data available in the study of nematics .",
    "gmst recovers mst when q=1 .",
    "near the nematic - isotropic phase transition temperature , the aggreement between gmst and the experimental data is broken . in table 1 , the variations of the density of paa with respect to temperature are given .",
    "in addition , in the recent studies , the entropic index is related to the number of particles of the system [ 29,30 ] .",
    "then a better aggreement with the experimental data could be obtained , which will be the subject of a forthcoming study .    from gmst ,",
    "the value of the order parameter  s at t@xmath27 is determined as 0.4 which is in good aggreement with the experimental values [ 31 - 35 ] , whereas 0.443 is given for s in mst .",
    "mst is the most widely used molecular field theory in the nematic liquid crystals .",
    "although this theory is successful in the study of some of the nematics , it fails for some others , one of which is paa , p - azoxyanisole . in this study , it is observed that , after the generalization of mst , the variation of the order parameter versus the temperature shows a better aggremeent with the experimental data .",
    "fig.1 exhibits the effect of nonextensivity .",
    "it is remarkable to note that the value of s at t@xmath27  is 0.4 which is given in refs.[31,32,33 ] .",
    "another important point is the variation of the density of paa with respect to the temperature[2 ] , presented in table 1 . as temperature increases ,",
    "the density of paa decreases .",
    "moreover , as mentioned earlier , in recent studies , the entropic index is related to the number of particles of the system [ 29,30 ] .",
    "therefore it is expected that q , the entropic index , could be related to the density , which will be the subject of another study in near future and the variation of s near t@xmath27 , nematic - isotropic phase transition temperature , could be explained hopefully by gmst .    following this study , a tendency to investigate liquid crystals within nonextensive formalisms",
    "could be expected .",
