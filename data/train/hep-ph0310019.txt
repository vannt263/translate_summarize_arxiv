    "the recent interests in pentaquark exotic hadrons were triggered by the discovery of the @xmath0 baryon by the leps collaboration at spring-8 @xcite , where the photon beam was used on a @xmath7c target to produce the pentaquark @xmath3 from @xmath8 reaction .",
    "the upper limit of its decay width ( @xmath9 ) was estimated to be 25 mev .",
    "the clas collaboration at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility used the photon - deuteron reaction to produce the @xmath3 and found the decay width to be less than 21 mev @xcite .",
    "the saphir collaboration used the photon - proton reaction ( @xmath2 ) , where the decay width is found to be less than 25 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 production with @xmath10 mev was also reported in the kaon - neutron reaction ( @xmath11 ) by the diana collaboration @xcite .",
    "recently the @xmath12 reaction was used to search for the @xmath3 with @xmath13 mev @xcite .",
    "although the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 are still to be determined , the interpretation of it as being a pentaquark @xmath14 state is solid because the @xmath3 has positive strangeness ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "such a low - lying pentaquark state with narrow width was first predicted in the chiral quark soliton model @xcite , although the existence of such exotic states was anticipated earlier in the study of the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental findings prompted a lot of theoretical reinvestigation of the pentaquark states including the pentaquark @xmath16 with one heavy antiquark .",
    "subsequent theoretical investigations on the @xmath3 include approaches based on the constituent quark model @xcite , skyrme model @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , chiral potential model @xcite , large @xmath17 qcd @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite , and group theory approach @xcite .",
    "the production of the @xmath3 was also discussed in relativistic nuclear collisions @xcite , where the number of the anti-@xmath0 produced are expected to be similar to that of the @xmath0 .",
    "however the genuine structure of the @xmath3 is still to be clarified , e.g. , it is not yet firmly established whether the @xmath3 forms an anti - decuplet with the roper resonance @xcite , and its spin - parity is not yet confirmed . on the other hand ,",
    "jaffe and wilczek suggested diquark - diquark - antiquark nature of the @xmath3 in the anti - decuplet plus octet representation of su(3 ) @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath3 is even claimed to be a heptaquark state .",
    "in addition , capstick _ et al .",
    "_ suggested @xmath3 as a member of isotensor pentaquark family @xcite , which is , however , doubted by the saphir experiment .    in the midst of such confusion ,",
    "one attempt is to assume certain quantum numbers for the @xmath3 and investigate its physical properties @xcite . as a starting point to compare with experimental observations",
    ", it is important to investigate the production processes of the @xmath3 in the photon - induced and pion - induced reactions .",
    "since the production processes are studied in the medium energy region , hadronic description would be more appropriate than perturbative qcd .",
    "there have been studies in this direction , where a hadronic model with effective interaction lagrangians was used to calculate the reaction cross sections . in refs .",
    "@xcite , liu and ko estimated the cross sections of positive - parity @xmath3 production from photon - nucleon scattering and various meson - nucleon scatterings .",
    "the authors considered not only the 2-body final states , but also 3-body final states .",
    "they claimed that the cross sections are about @xmath18 mb in pion - nucleon reaction , @xmath19 nb in photon - proton reaction , and @xmath20 nb in photon - neutron reaction @xcite .",
    "the cross section for photon - neutron reaction is claimed to be substantially larger than that for photon - proton reaction .",
    "the values are changed in their sequential work @xcite , which includes the contributions from the @xmath21 exchanges in the photon - nucleon reactions . however",
    ", this work does not take into account the tensor coupling of the photon - nucleon and photon-@xmath3 interactions .",
    "in particular , they did not include the @xmath22-channel diagrams and the anomalous magnetic momentum terms in the @xmath23-channels in photoproduction reaction , which were shown to be important in ref .",
    "in addition , the final results were obtained by multiplying a form factor which is a function of the center - of - mass energy only . in ref .",
    "@xcite , nam _ et al .",
    "_ considered @xmath24 process using pseudoscalar and pseudovector couplings as well as a hybrid model .",
    "then the authors included the effects of the form factors by dividing the cross section by an overall energy - independent constant , whose value is obtained from a similar prescription to match the theoretical born term estimate of the total cross section for kaon photoproduction to the experimental data .",
    "they also considered the case where the quantum numbers of the @xmath3 are @xmath25 .",
    "then they found that the @xmath3 production cross section in photon - neutron reaction near threshold is 1420 nb for negative - parity @xmath3 and 100240 nb for the positive - parity @xmath3 .",
    "however , in their work , the @xmath21 exchange was not considered and the assumption that the @xmath3 production cross section can just be divided by a constant factor is unjustified .",
    "experimentally , the only information available for any production cross sections comes from the saphir collaboration @xcite , which claims that the cross section for @xmath2 is similar to that of @xmath26 photoproduction and is order of 200 nb near threshold , which is to be confirmed by further analyses @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we perform a more consistent calculation on the photoproduction of the @xmath3 from the nucleon targets and on the pion - induced production from the proton target .",
    "the latter reaction is of particular interest since the current kek experiment searching for the @xmath3 is using this reaction .",
    "such a reaction can also be studied with the recent pion beam facility at gsi .",
    "several improvements are included in our work compared with previous hadronic model calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite . to investigate the sensitivity on the possible form factors , we employ form factors that are functions of the transferred momenta and compare the results with the previous ones that use different prescriptions for the form factors .",
    "we also include the @xmath21 exchanges in the @xmath27-channel in all relevant reactions .",
    "as we will show , the contributions from the @xmath21 exchange is appreciable in all the production reactions considered and in fact dominant in the pion - induced reaction . another important question that we address is",
    "the parity of the @xmath3 , which is not yet settled .",
    "for example , refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that the parity of the @xmath3 is preferably odd , while many other approaches including soliton models claim or assume it to be even .",
    "therefore we will first present the results assuming that the @xmath0 is an isosinglet , spin-1/2 baryon with positive parity , and then the results with assuming that the @xmath3 has negative parity will be compared and discussed .",
    "the feynman diagrams of @xmath3 photoproduction from the neutron and proton targets are shown in figs . [",
    "fig : gam - n ] and [ fig : gam - p ] .",
    "the momenta of the incoming photon , the nucleon , the outgoing @xmath30 , and the @xmath31 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the mandelstam variables are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "it should be noted that we have neglected the @xmath22-channel diagrams in which the intermediate baryon is the nucleon resonance , including the roper resonances or the non - strange analog of the @xmath3 that could be the roper @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "such approximations should be good enough in a first attempt calculation , where at least all the ground state nucleon , pseudoscalar and vector mesons are consistently included .    for the parity of the @xmath3 , we note that the chiral quark soliton model predicts even parity .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the skyrme model results on the pentaquark states containing one heavy anti - quark . in that model ,",
    "the lowest state of pentaquark with one heavy antiquark and four light @xmath40 quarks has @xmath41 and @xmath42 , while the first excited state has @xmath41 and @xmath25 , and the @xmath43 pentaquarks are higher states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 with @xmath44 is also favored by a recent skyrme model study @xcite and a constituent quark model study @xcite .",
    "thus , we first assume that the @xmath3 has positive parity postponing the negative - parity case to sec .",
    "then the effective lagrangians read @xmath45 \\theta , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{l}_{\\gamma n n } & = & -e \\bar{n } \\left [ a_\\mu \\gamma^\\mu \\frac{1+\\tau_3}{2 } - \\frac{1}{4m_n }",

    "the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron are @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . here",
    "we use the su(3 ) lagrangian for the phases of the @xmath50 interactions @xcite .    for the @xmath21 exchange ,",
    "we use @xmath51    the coupling constants are determined as follows .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath52 gives the decay width of @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the nucleon and @xmath3 mass , respectively , and @xmath57 is the momentum of the kaon in the @xmath3 rest frame .",
    "thus , the coupling @xmath58 can be estimated from the @xmath3 decay width . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the decay ratio @xmath59 was shown to be dependent on the isospin of the @xmath3 .",
    "if the @xmath3 is an isosinglet , this ratio becomes one . theoretically , the chiral soliton model of ref .",
    "@xcite predicted a very narrow width of less than 15 mev .",
    "later it was claimed to be about 5 mev in an improved analysis of the same model @xcite .",
    "this small decay width seems to be consistent with recent analyses on @xmath60 scattering that suggest a narrow width of a few mev for the @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , only the upper bound of the @xmath3 decay width is known , around 925 mev .",
    "if we take the results of the chiral quark soliton model @xcite and the @xmath60 scattering analyses @xcite , which is @xmath61 mev , we get @xmath62 this value is much smaller than @xmath63 , which is @xmath64 , but rather close to @xmath65 which is @xmath66 @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use @xmath67 following ref .",
    "the only undetermined parameter in eq .",
    "( [ lag : theta ] ) is @xmath68 , the anomalous magnetic moment of the @xmath3 , which should reveal the structure of the @xmath3 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors estimated @xmath68 in several models .",
    "for example , they obtained @xmath69 in the diquark - diquark - antiquark picture of jaffe and wilczek @xcite , while @xmath70 if the @xmath3 is a @xmath60 system .",
    "these values are different from the chiral quark soliton model which gives @xmath71 @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will treat @xmath68 as a free parameter and give the results in the range of @xmath72 .",
    "the lagrangians of eq .",
    "( [ lag : k * ] ) contain four coupling constants .",
    "the coupling @xmath73 is estimated from the experimental data for @xmath21 radiative decays .",
    "the decay width is given by @xmath74 using the experimental values @xcite , we obtain @xmath75 gev@xmath76 for the neutral decay and @xmath77 gev@xmath76 for the charged decay . however , there is no information on the couplings @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "since the decay of the @xmath3 into @xmath81 is not kinematically allowed , we have to rely on theoretical estimate which is , however , not available until now .",
    "the only hint we have is that @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which are smaller than @xmath84 and @xmath65 by a factor of 2.43.5 or 1.21.8 @xcite . from this observation",
    ", we expect that @xmath78 would be smaller than @xmath58 . however , their relative phase is still unfixed .",
    "thus , we treat @xmath78 as a free parameter and give the results by varying @xmath78 .",
    "we shall find that measuring pion - induced process together with the photon - induced processes will give us a clue on the @xmath78 coupling .",
    "the tensor couplings @xmath85 and @xmath86 should also be examined , but it will _ not _ be considered in this exploratory study .",
    "the photoproduction amplitudes are in general written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the photon polarization vector . with the effective lagrangians",
    "above , it is straightforward to obtain the production amplitudes . for @xmath8 reaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gam - n ] ) , we have @xmath89 and for @xmath2 ( fig . [",
    "fig : gam - p ] ) we get @xmath90    here we have multiplied form factors which take into account the structure of each vertex . the gauge invariance ( @xmath91 ) is then easily checked when all the form factors are set to one . in @xmath8 , the @xmath27-channel @xmath21 exchange and the @xmath22-channel terms have gauge - invariant forms .",
    "the gauge non - invariant part of the @xmath27-channel @xmath30 exchange is canceled by that of the @xmath23-channel terms . in @xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath27-channel @xmath21 exchange is gauge - invariant . and the sum of the @xmath22-channel and @xmath23-channel is gauge - invariant . but introducing different form factors at each vertex spoils gauge invariance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , to keep gauge invariance and to include the effects of form factors , the cross section for @xmath8 obtained from tree graphs is multiplied by 0.18 .",
    "this factor is the average value of @xmath92 in @xmath93 reaction near threshold , where @xmath94 contains the contribution from the born terms only .",
    "however , in @xmath93 there are other production mechanisms such as nucleon and hyperon resonances which interfere with the @xmath30/@xmath21 exchanges and the nucleon born terms @xcite . thus assuming the same suppression in @xmath95 photoproduction and @xmath3 photoproduction is questionable and should be further tested . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors used the same form factor for all channels which is a function of @xmath96 only , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the three - momentum of the initial state particles in the cm frame , @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , as the energy becomes larger , the cross section becomes smaller since @xmath101 decreases rapidly with energy .",
    "since the form of the form factors and the cutoff parameters should be justified by experimental data , measuring the total and differential cross sections should discern the form factor dependence of the cross sections .    in this work ,",
    "we take another approach for the form factors .",
    "motivated by the analyses of kaon photoproduction @xcite , we use the form factor @xcite @xmath102 for _ each vertex_. here @xmath103 is the mass of the exchanged particle and @xmath104 is the square of the transferred momentum .",
    "this has the correct on - shell condition that @xmath105 at @xmath106 .",
    "however introducing different form factors depending on the channels breaks gauge invariance .",
    "there are several recipes in restoring gauge invariance with the use of phenomenological form factors @xcite .",
    "but the results depend on the employed form factors and the way to restore gauge invariance . in order to avoid any complication and to keep gauge invariance in a simple way , we use @xmath107 and @xmath108",
    "this is an unsatisfactory aspect of this hadronic model approach , but it should be sufficient for this qualitative study . for comparison , we will give the results obtained with this form factor and those with the form factor of eq .",
    "( [ ff : ko ] ) .",
    "we are now ready to calculate the cross sections for @xmath3 photoproduction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gam - woff ] , the total cross sections for @xmath8 and @xmath2 are given without form factors .",
    "for this calculation we set @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gam - woff ] , the dashed lines are obtained without the @xmath21 exchanges and the dot - dashed lines are with the @xmath21 exchanges alone .",
    "the solid lines are their sums .",

    "this holds even in the absence of the @xmath21 exchanges ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : gam - woff ] ) .",
    "several comments are in order . in @xmath8 reaction , there are strong ( destructive ) interference among the channels .",
    "in contrast to the assumption of ref .",
    "@xcite , the contributions from the @xmath22- and @xmath23-channels are not suppressed . in both reactions , we found that the @xmath21 exchange is not suppressed compared to the other production mechanisms although it strongly depends on the unknown coupling @xmath78 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath21 exchange interferes destructively with the other amplitudes in @xmath8 but constructively in @xmath2 .",
    "if the relative phase between @xmath58 and @xmath78 is changed , then the interference patterns are reversed . in this case , @xmath8 has larger cross section than @xmath2 when @xmath111 gev . for @xmath112 gev ,",
    "the cross section for @xmath2 becomes larger and increases faster than that of @xmath8 .",

    "however when @xmath115 , the cross section for @xmath8 is slightly larger . in order to see the contributions from the @xmath21 exchange , we give the results without the @xmath21 exchange with @xmath119 ( dotted lines in fig .  [",

    "we use the cutoff @xmath120 as fixed in the study of @xmath95 photoproduction with the same form factor prescription @xcite .",
    "we see that with this form factor the final results are not so sensitive to the phase of the @xmath78 coupling , indicating the large contributions from the @xmath21 exchanges .",
    "we notice that our results are consistent with the observation of saphir collaboration that the cross section for @xmath2 is about 200 nb in the photon energy range from 1.7 to 2.6 gev and it is similar to the cross section for @xmath26 photoproduction .",
    "for comparison , we give the total cross section for @xmath26 photoproduction in the literature @xcite by the dot - dot - dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : gam - ff18](b , d ) .",
    "this shows that the positive phase of @xmath78 is favored by saphir experiment .",
    "in addition , the cross section for @xmath2 is larger in most cases .",
    "we also find that the energy dependence of the cross sections for the two reactions are different . in @xmath8 ,",
    "the cross section saturates as the energy increases , while it keeps increasing with the energy in @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath68 dependence is negligible for the photon - proton reaction , while in photon - neutron reaction the cross section nontrivially depends on @xmath68 . since different choice of the form factors gives different results , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : gam - ffko ] and [ fig : gam - ff18 ] , it would be very useful to have measurements on the total and especially differential cross sections to justify a particular type of the form factors and to discriminate the role of the each production channel .",

    "we also employ the form factors and cutoff parameters motivated by the study of @xmath95 photoproduction .",
    "our results show that the photon - proton reaction cross section is somehow larger than that of the photon - neutron reaction .",
    "this is in contrast to the conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite , which predicted larger cross section for the photon - neutron reaction .",
    "this is mainly because the model of refs .",
    "@xcite does not include the tensor coupling of the electromagnetic interactions and the @xmath21 exchanges were not coherently included in both reactions .",
    "the cross sections of the two reactions , photon - neutron and photon - proton reactions , are in the range of a few hundred nb , which seems to be consistent with the saphir observation as far as photon - proton reaction is concerned .",
    "but they have different energy dependence which should be verified by experiments and can test the models adopted in this study . furthermore , saphir collaboration claimed that the cross section of @xmath2 is similar to that of @xmath162 . if this is confirmed , the positive phase of the @xmath78 seems to be favored .",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig : gam - ff18](b ) . ]",
    "the pion - induced reaction has much larger cross section than the photon - induced reactions .",
    "we found that this reaction is very sensitive to the magnitude of the @xmath149 coupling but not so to its phase .",
    "so measurement of this reaction would give us a guide to estimate the magnitude of @xmath78 .",
    "due to lack of information , we could not investigate the role of the tensor couplings of the @xmath149 interaction and the role of nucleon resonances like the nucleon analog of the @xmath3 in the @xmath22-channels .",
    "therefore , theoretical studies on the @xmath31 couplings in various models are highly desirable and useful to understand the structure and the production mechanisms of the @xmath3",
    ".    since we are employing covariant form factors which are different from the form factors used in previous studies @xcite , it will be useful to measure differential cross sections , which will discriminate between different form factors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffcs ] , we give our predictions on the differential cross sections for @xmath8 , @xmath163 , and @xmath4 with the photon or pion energy at 2.5 gev , where the scattering angle @xmath164 is defined by the directions of the initial photon ( pion ) momentum and the final @xmath30 meson momentum in the cm frame .",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed lines are obtained with @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath165 , respectively , where @xmath67 .",
    "this shows that the differential cross section for @xmath4 has forward peak which is due to the dominance of the @xmath21 exchange . in photoproduction",
    ", the differential cross section is suppressed at forward angles and the peak is at @xmath166 . in particular , a backward ( secondary ) peak is observed in the case of photon - proton reaction .    finally , we have also investigated the production processes of negative - parity @xmath3 since several studies claim that the @xmath3 has odd - parity .",
    "we found that the cross sections in this case are very much suppressed compared with the positive - parity @xmath3 case .",
    "thus the interpretation of the @xmath3 as an odd - parity pentaquark state seems to be disfavored by the saphir observation which claims that the cross section for photon - proton reaction is about 200 nb .",
    "so if the saphir results are confirmed by other experiments , the interpretation of the @xmath3 as an @xmath41 and @xmath44 pentaquark will be strongly supported .",
    "most importantly , further experimental measurements are crucial to make any decisive conclusion on the couplings and the structure of the @xmath3 .",
