    "the timescale at which a protoplanetary disk loses its primordial gas , which dominates the total disk mass , is a crucial factor regarding the outcome of the planet forming process in the vicinity of high mass stars .",
    "the photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks by external uv radiation in an environment dominated by high mass o - stars is a particularly potent mechanism for removing disk material .",
    "the timescale of photoevaporation is governed by the amount of uv radiation from the nearby o - stars , which significantly erodes the protoplanetary disk in less than a million years .",
    "studies of disk erosion agree that the outer part of the disk evaporates quickly ; however according to , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite the erosion of the disk slows down significantly when the size reaches 10 au . other authors",

    "therefore , the presence of high mass stars might be lethal for forming planets since the euv and fuv radiation of a nearby o - star can disrupt the protoplanetary disk on a short time scale ( a couple of times @xmath9 yr ) and stop the planet formation process .",
    "on the other hand the radiation might trigger the formation of rocky planets by accelerating the dust settling and grain growth in the midplane of the disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of three comet like structures near different o - type stars ( with the comet - like tails pointing away from the central high mass star ) in 24 @xmath1 m _ spitzer_/mips images . adopting a radiation - pressure driven outflow disk model",
    "@xcite they concluded that these objects are photoevaporating protoplanetary disks where dust entrained in the photoevaporative flow is responsible for the mid - infrared tails detected at 24 @xmath1 m .",
    "the tails extend up to 0.2 pc from the evaporation working surface , so they are convenient for detailed study . to investigate this phenomenon further and to get a better understanding of the nature of these objects , we have searched these three systems for the gas expected to be a significant component of the flow .",
    "we used pa@xmath0 as an ideal tracer of the photoevaporation process , since it is the strongest emission line in the near infrared and is not strongly affected by extinction .",
    "we also report mid - ir spectra to provide a better understanding of the physical processes in the disk and to help determine the properties of the dust .",
    "we used hst / nicmos to search for ionized hydrogen , predicted to be an abundant product of photoevaporation in a protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "we chose the filters f187n and f190n ( pa@xmath0 line and a nearby lineless continuum ) because we expected to detect the strongest emission in these filters .",
    "our targets were the three objects detected at 24 @xmath1 m by @xcite .",

    "it is clear that the tail structure is not visible in the pa@xmath0 images even after continuum subtraction .",
    "however in all cases there is an unresolved point source in the comets head , which confirms that the photoevaporating source is indeed a star and not an extended globule .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the continuum images following the prescription in the nicmos data handbook to estimate the continuum flux of the central object . in two cases ( ngc  2264 and ic  1396 ) the nicmos fluxes are in good agreement with fluxes calculated from the 2mass data ( see figs .",

    "this is in agreement with the photoevaporation models .",
    "as we showed in section 3.1 , the pa@xmath0 images and the mid - infrared spectra suggest that the gas - to - dust mass ratio in these systems is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the conventional value of 100:1 that was assumed in @xcite , so the flow is essentially gas free .",
    "the low gas - to - dust mass ratio requires changes in the assumptions made when calculating the mass loss rate of these objects . instead of the value 10 km / s used in @xcite assuming that the gas is dragging the dust",
    ", we have to use the terminal velocity assuming that the primary forces on the grains are radiation pressure from the o star and a drag force from particles in the surrounding hii region .",

    "our calculations show that it is about an order of magnitude higher ( around 200 - 300 km / s ) than the value used by @xcite .",
    "however the new gas - to - dust mass ratio decreases the total amount of outflowing material by about 2 orders of magnitude leaving us with a mass loss rate about 10 times lower than was originally calculated by @xcite .",
    "although the lower limit on the mass loss rate of the dust is an order of magnitude higher ( @xmath107 ) , the upper limit has not changed significantly because the change in the assumption of the maximum grain size ( from 1 mm to 1 @xmath1 m ; see discussion in section 4.2 ) and the changes in the assumption about the outflow velocity and in the gas - to - dust ratio cancel each other ( leaving only a factor of three difference ) resulting in mass loss upper limits of @xmath108 .",

    "@xcite modeled the evolution of a circumstellar disk in the presence of external uv radiation and suggested that as a result of photoevaporation the outer disk becomes completely gas depleted .",
    "it is possible that uv radiation has photoablated the disks for our three sources down to the gravitational radius in ionized gas ( @xmath63 - 5 au for 1 @xmath79 ) so these cometary structures are produced by a highly processed disk that has lost most of its gas and started the dust regeneration process in the midplane of the disk .",
    "radiation pressure from the central o - star and dynamical processes in the circumstellar disk would then be expelling this dust from the disk .    assuming nearly radial orbits and relative velocities between the o - star and the disk - bearing star equal to the cluster velocity dispersion we can estimate the time the disk - bearing stars have spent in the sphere of influence of the o - star ( @xmath122 0.5 pc * ? ? ? * ) in our three systems . assuming also that the current distances of the disk - bearing stars to the o - stars are the closest point of their orbit to the o - star ( giving the lower limit for the total time spent in the 0.5 pc sphere ) we find that they have spent about @xmath123 years within the sphere of influence",
    ". we can estimate how much material they lose until they arrive at their current position based on the photoevaporation rate - distance relation of @xcite ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath125 from @xcite .",
    "we integrated the total mass loss during the time the disk - bearing star spends in the sphere of influence of the o - star .",
    "our calculation showed that in our three systems the total lost disk material is about 0.012 - 0.016 @xmath79 .",
    "we present the results in table 4 .",
    "the total lost mass is sufficiently large that a typical protoplanetary disk ( @xmath126 to @xmath127 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be totally photoevaporated during the time it spends in the close vicinity of the o - star .",
    "we also calculated what the mass loss rate would be at the current positions of our photoevaporating tails , also based on the formula of @xcite .",
    "we derived values @xmath128 which are a couple of orders of magnitude higher than the current mass loss rates ( table 4 ) .",
    "this is not a surprise since most of the material is already gone from the disk and also the mechanism that removes the dust from the disk is entirely different from the classical photoevaporation where the flow is gas rich .",
    "it is interesting to compare the mass loss rates for these objects with that for the vega debris disk , where @xcite find an anomalously high loss rate . taking their estimated total debris mass of @xmath129 in grains between 1 and 46 @xmath1 m in radius and their dwell time of @xmath78 1000 years for these grains near the star ,",
    "the mass loss is @xmath130 .",
    "the evaporating disks are losing grain mass at similar or higher rates ( table 4 ) .",
    "there are many theoretical treatments of photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks by hot stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general",
    ", these treatments agree qualitatively that the process requires @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath131 yrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to shrink to a core disk of size 5 @xmath2 10 au that is resistant to further erosion @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the time scales toward the short end of this range are likely to be applicable . the evaporation is powered by dust absorption of uv photons , followed by gas heating primarily by the photoelectric effect , with the resulting outflow of hot gas carrying along small , sub - micron sized dust grains .",
    "the larger dust grains will be left in a relatively gas - free environment .",
    "@xcite show that these grains will be in an unstable configuration that will collapse to the disk mid - plain and that planet growth could be triggered as a result .",
    "there are other consequences . with",
    "the gas removed , its damping effects on grain motions ( e.g. , circularization of orbits ) are also removed .",
    "grains will collide and initiate collisional cascades , that lead to a highly elevated rate of production of small , second - generation grains .",
    "these grains can be ejected by photon pressure , either due to photons from the central star or , more likely , those from the o - star .",
    "this mechanism is a natural way to produce the large numbers of small grains required in our models of the infrared output of the tails of these sources .",
    "an additional driver for a large grain collision rate is the effect of photon pressure from the o - star perturbing the orbits of small grains that nevertheless remain gravitationally bound to the low mass star .",
    "the conditions for photon - pressure blow - out of grains in the disk around the low mass star can be derived as follows .",
    "let @xmath41 be the ratio of photon to gravitational force on a grain in the vicinity of the o star by itself .",
    "photon - pressure - driven blow - out occurs for @xmath41 @xmath106 0.5",
    ". the equivalent ratio of forces for a grain near the low mass star must include its gravity , resulting in a reduction of @xmath41 approximately in proportion to the ratio of gravitational forces from the two stars at the position of the grain .",
    "it is easily shown that the modified ratio has a value of 0.5 at a distance from the low mass ( mass @xmath132 ) star given by    @xmath133    where @xmath15 is its distance from the high mass star ( mass @xmath134 ) .",
    "the term @xmath135 is of order 1 and depends on where the grain is in its orbit . @xcite",
    "have determined values of @xmath41 for grains of various compositions and sizes around a number of stars .",
    "the values are roughly similar for a given grain size ; grain composition enters as a secondary parameter .",
    "we will use typical values in the following discussion . taking the values for the o9.5 v star @xmath136 oph , grains of radius between 0.01 and 1 @xmath1 m have @xmath137 1000 - 10000 .",
    "we take a typical distance between our high and low mass stars to be @xmath15 = 0.2 pc , and also assume 40 @xmath89 for the high mass star and 0.6@xmath89 for the low mass one .",
    "we then find that the o - star photon pressure on such small grains becomes dominant at a distance of @xmath78 110 au from the low mass star .",
    "small grains well inside this radius will be held in orbit by the gravitational field of the low - mass star . for larger grains , @xmath41 drops rapidly ; typically it is @xmath138 50 for 10 @xmath1 m radius grains .",
    "the corresponding distance for them where photon pressure from the o star overcomes the gravity of the low - mass one is @xmath78 500 au , that is , outside the boundary of a typical protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the larger grains are likely to remain bound to the low mass star throughout the disk , where they will continue to be ground down by collisions .    that is , the grains making up the `` comet tail '' probably originate from collisional cascades in the outer regions of the circumstellar disk .",
    "these regions have previously been cleared of gas by photoevaporation and the remaining solid particles are settling toward the disk mid - plain and starting to assemble into larger bodies ( see @xcite for details ) , leading to generation of these grains in a vigorous episode of collisional cascades .",
    "however , given typical sizes of protoplanetary disks , this process is likely to be effective only up to a maximum grain size of about a micron radius .",
    "the tails are composed primarily of grains of @xmath78 0.01 @xmath1 m to @xmath78 1 @xmath1 m in radius ( where the lower limit is set by the model fits to their surface brightness profiles ; balog et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we have modified the upper mass limits derived by @xcite to reflect the approximate grain size limit of 1 @xmath1 m .",
    "this approximate limit results from the tendency of larger grains to remain gravitationally bound to the low - mass star .      from the mass loss rates and typical disk masses in section 4.1",
    ", we can estimate an approximate timescale of @xmath139 yrs for which this phenomenon is visible .",
    "therefore , the phenomenon might be quite common , however we see only three cases in our gto survey of about 20 o stars ( there are additional cases around three o - stars in the w5 region , koenig et al . in preparation ) suggesting that this is probably a short lived rather rare phenomenon ( only about 1/4 of the observed o - stars have cometary structures in their neighborhood ) .",
    "we present hst / nicmos pa@xmath0 images and irs spectra of cometary structures detected in _",
    "spitzer_/mips 24 @xmath1 m images .",
    "we estimate an upper limit to the amount of gas in the comets disk and tail and find that the gas - to - dust mass ratio is much lower than the value observed in the ism : the tails are essentially gas free . using this new observation we are able to constrain the flow velocity and thus the mass loss rate .",
    "the new mass loss rates allow us to estimate the timescale on which the phenomenon occurs ( @xmath139 yr ) .",
    "the short timescale favors photoevaporation models predicting quick removal of gas from the outer parts of the disk .",
    "the `` comet tails '' are produced from the outer regions of the disks , where larger grains collide at an elevated rate generating second generation dust .",
    "these small grains are then ejected due to photon pressure from the nearby o - star .",
    "the sed of the sources shows excess emission between 3 and 8 @xmath1 m , in agreement with the irs low resolution spectra .",
    "this emission indicates that there is an inner disk that survives the photoevaporation process for longer than @xmath9 years , as predicted by the photoevaporation models .",
