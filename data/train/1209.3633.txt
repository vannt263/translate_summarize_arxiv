    "these two main classifications does not cover peculiar astrophysical objects such as the nebula around which is characterized by high velocity , @xmath5 300 @xmath0 and low energy involved , @xmath6 .",
    "we now summarize the existing models on these three astrophysical objects .",
    "* pn * the pn rarely presents a circular shape generally thought to be the projection of a sphere on the sky . in order to explain the properties of pn , @xcite proposed the interacting stellar wind ( isw ) theory .",
    "later on @xcite proposed the two wind model and the two phase model .",
    "more often various types of shapes such as elliptical , bipolar or cigar are present , see  @xcite .",
    "the bipolar pns , for example , are explained by the interaction of the winds which originate from the central star , see  @xcite .",
    "another class of models explains some basic structures in pns through hydrodynamical models , see  @xcite or through self - organized magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) plasma configurations with radial flow , see  @xcite .",
    "an attempt to make a catalog of line profiles using various shapes observed in real pns was done by @xcite .",
    "this online atlas , available at http://132.248.1.102/atlas@xmath7profiles/img/ , is composed of 26 photo - ionization models corresponding to 5 geometries , 3 angular density laws and 2 cavity sizes , four velocity fields for a total of 104 pns , each of which can be observed from 3 different directions .",
    "@xcite suggest that a planetary nebula is formed and evolves by the interaction of a fast wind from a central star with a slow wind from its progenitor , an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .    * * the nebula around @xmath8-carinae was discovered by @xcite and the name `` the homunculus '' arises from the fact that on the photographic plates it resembled a small plump man , see @xcite .",
    "more details on the various aspects of @xmath8-carinae can be found in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the homunculus nebula around @xmath8-carinae has been analyzed with different models , we cite some of them :    * the shape and kinematics is explained by the interaction of the winds expelled by the central star at different injection velocities , see @xcite . *",
    "the possibility that the nebulae around luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) are shaped by interacting winds has been analyzed by @xcite . in this case a density contrast profile of the form @xmath9 = @xmath10 was used where @xmath11 is the angle to the equatorial plane .",
    "* the origin and evolution of the bipolar nebula has been modeled by a numerical two - dimensional gasdynamic model where a stellar wind interacts with an aspherical circumstellar environment , see @xcite .",
    "* cooling models form ballistic flows ( that is , a pair of cones each with a spherical base ) whose lateral edges become wrinkled by shear instabilities , see @xcite .",
    "* the scaling relations derived from the theory of radiatively driven winds can model the outflows from luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars , taking account of stellar rotation and the associated latitudinal variation of the stellar flux due to gravity darkening .",
    "in particular for a star rotating close to its critical speed , the decrease in effective gravity near the equator and the associated decrease in the equatorial wind speed results naturally in a bipolar , prolate interaction front , and therefore in an asymmetric wind , see @xcite . *",
    "two oppositely ejected jets inflate two lobes ( or bubbles ) representing a unified model for the formation of bipolar lobes , see @xcite . * a two - dimensional , time - dependent hydrodynamical simulation of radiative cooling ,",

    "* snr * the study of the supernova remnant ( snr ) started with @xcite where an on ongoing collisional excitation as a result of a post - explosion expansion of the snr against the ambient medium was suggested .",
    "the next six decades where dedicated to the deduction of an analytical or numerical law of expansion .",
    "the target is a relationship for the instantaneous radius of expansion , @xmath12 , of the type @xmath13 where @xmath14 is time and @xmath15 is a parameter that depends on the chosen model . on adopting this point of view , the sedov expansion predicts @xmath16 , see @xcite , and the thin layer approximation in the presence of a constant density medium predicts @xmath17 , see @xcite .",
    "a simple approach to the snr evolution in the first @xmath18 yr assumes an initial free expansion in which @xmath19 until the surrounding mass is of the order of 1 @xmath20 and a second phase characterized by the energy conservation in which according to the sedov solution @xmath21 , see @xcite .",
    "a third phase characterized by an adiabatic expansion with @xmath22 starts after @xmath18 yr , see @xcite .",

    "<S> the first process is the expansion of the shell that can be modeled by the canonical laws of motion in the spherical case and by the momentum conservation when gradients of density are present in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the simulations is introduced along one direction as well along many directions . </S>",

    "<S> the third process is the composition of the image through an integral operation along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the developed framework is applied to three pn which are a39 , the ring nebula and the etched hourglass nebula mycn 18 , the hybrid object eta - carinae , and to two snr which are sn 1993j and sn 1006 . in all the considered cases a careful comparison between the observed and theoretical profiles in intensity </S>",
