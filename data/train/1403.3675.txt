    "i.e. , e@xmath315 @xmath316 and @xmath317 tev , @xmath312 scales by a factor of @xmath318 .",
    "the huge br suppression for new @xmath0 decays predicts @xmath319 events [ @xmath320 events with br@xmath321 at the parton level ] , taking e@xmath322 tev and an integrated luminosity @xmath323 .",
    "clearly , even without further reduction from the efficiency issues , these practically background - free signals are rather difficult to detect with both current and upcoming collider searches ( e.g. , _ megaw _ and _ okuw _ modes of the linear collider @xcite and triple large electron - positron collider ( tlep ) @xcite with about @xmath324 and @xmath325 @xmath0 bosons / year , respectively ) .",
    "detecting these signals may appear feasible by using the techniques from the flavor sector , especially when br@xmath326 and br@xmath327 have already been probed up to @xmath328 @xcite and @xmath329 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the latter would reach @xmath330 in the near future @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , unusual @xmath1 decays ( both prompt and displaced ) for the lhc run - i with @xmath331 fb@xmath332 gives about 62500 parton - level events with the maximum br estimate .",
    "note that , as already stated , not all of the daughter particles are hard , i.e. , with high transverse momentum .",
    "hence , this number will reduce further considering practical issues like @xmath333-tagging ( @xmath5-tagging ) efficiency @xcite , faking , etc . for displaced decays , the reconstruction efficiency of the displaced vertices diminishes this number even further . assuming an optimal scenario with a detection efficiency of 50% ( 25% ) for the two leading ( subleading ) daughters ,",
    "experimentally one can detect only @xmath334 1.5% of the parton - level events , i.e. , about 938 surviving events . repeating the same exercise for the lhc run - ii with e@xmath335 tev and @xmath336 fb@xmath332 ,",
    "one gets about 7500 surviving events out of @xmath337 parton - level events . making a similar analysis for @xmath338 in the sm with a br of @xmath339 gives @xmath340 and @xmath341 events for run - i and run - ii , respectively .",
    "it is now apparent that the final number of events for these spectacular signatures remains below that coming from the errors of the sm measurement .",
    "thus , unless one adopts dedicated experimental searches ( as already mentioned ) to perform a faithful construction of the @xmath342 jets @xmath146 ( @xmath343 for @xmath5 jets ) , which is supposed to peak around @xmath60 , it remains hardly possible to isolate these new signals from the sm backgrounds .",
    "consequently , the region of parameter space with @xmath344 remains unconstrained from the existing experimental results .",
    "a similar logic remains applicable for the @xmath345 process , through leptonic @xmath5 decays following @xmath346 . here , for run - i , and @xmath347 fb@xmath332 as studied by the atlas collaboration @xcite , one gets a maximum of 761 events at the parton level , including @xmath348 flavors , while the sm number is @xmath349 with the latest br@xmath93 @xcite .",
    "so , unless @xmath350 , these novel signals normally lie beneath their sm counterparts , and hence the region of parameter space giving @xmath351 @xmath275 @xmath60 @xmath275 @xmath99 remains exempted from the experimental constraints .",
    "the existing results for br@xmath93 measurements in the sm @xcite , however , put constraints on the corner of parameter space with @xmath260 , unless @xmath352 or @xmath353 .",
    "the @xmath260 region , however , is already challenged by a class of flavor observables @xcite .",
    "note that , concerning statistics , the upcoming colliders ( _ gigaz _ and _ teraz _ modes of the linear collider @xcite and tlep @xcite with about @xmath354 and @xmath355 @xmath1 bosons / year , respectively ) are comparable to the lhc run - ii , e.g. , with _ teraz _ one expects about @xmath356 to @xmath357 novel @xmath1-decay events when the br varies from @xmath358 to @xmath359 . nonetheless , the unprecedented accuracy of these new colliders would proficiently constrain the concerned region of parameter space giving rare signals , e.g. , in tlep the error in @xmath115 would reduce to @xmath360 10 kev @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a complete analytical study of all possible two - body nonstandard @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays in the context of susy theories .",
    "the detection of these decays at the lhc or in a future collider ( of course , with evolved search criteria ) would provide an unambiguous sign of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the presence of these signals will also offer an experimental test for the @xmath9 , the _",
    "simplest _ extension of the mssm to accommodate these unique signatures , apart from solving shortcomings of the mssm .",
    "we also show that other variants of susy models can be investigated in a similar way .",
    "after the latest and improved measurement of @xmath345 processes by the atlas collaboration , we look forward to further analysis in this direction , both from the cms and atlas collaborations , involving @xmath333 jets or @xmath5 jets , coming from both prompt and displaced origin .",
    "missing evidence of these modes , in the presence of a proper experimental setup , would constrain the feasibility of light @xmath178 , and @xmath42 states . even the existing bound on the branching fractions can disfavor certain regions of the parameter space , e.g. @xmath133 around @xmath361 with @xmath362 gev .",
    "we further observed that the region of parameter space with @xmath363 and @xmath260 is largely excluded from @xmath345 searches in the sm unless one considers @xmath353 .    the work of p.g . and c.m .",
