    "it was noted many years ago that the form of the @xmath11-meson peak is distorted by the interference between resonant and non - resonant @xmath0 production . for the case of `` elastic '' @xmath12 photoproduction",
    "the effect was studied by p.sding in @xcite and s.drell @xcite . at high energies",
    "the main ( and the only ) source of background is the drell - hiida - deck process @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the incoming photon fluctuates into the pion pair and then @xmath13-elastic scattering takes place .",
    "thus the amplitude for the background may be written in terms of the pion - proton cross section .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the interference with some non - resonant background is indeed needed to describe the distribution over the mass - @xmath14 of @xmath0 pair .",
    "m.arneodo proposed @xcite that this effect can be used to estimate the value of @xmath15 from hera data at high energies , in the range which is not otherwise acceptable .",
    "our calculations @xcite show that really the data on @xmath14 distributions in the case of @xmath0 pair production can be described satisfactory with the realistic value of @xmath16 30 mb at energy @xmath17 gev@xmath18 .    to prove that this method of extraction of total @xmath13 cross section is really working",
    ", it should give the same values of @xmath19 for all resonances which decay into @xmath0 pair .",
    "so in the present paper we will consider the mass distribution of produced @xmath0 in the region of @xmath2 meson .",
    "the situation with @xmath0 pair production in the region of @xmath2 mass is not simple because there are evidence @xcite that here two different resonances exist , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the `` tail '' from @xmath22 production is not negligibly small .",
    "however , if the amplitude of @xmath23 scattering is an analitycal function with good behaviour at infinity in @xmath24 complex plane , the @xmath24 distribution should be determined totally by the singularities of elastic @xmath23 amplitude , i.e. by contributions of all resonances and the cut corresponding to the @xmath25 non - resonant production .    in sect .",
    "2 the formulae for the @xmath25 background which are valid for the dis as well as for the photoproduction region are presented .",
    "the expression differs slightly from the sding s one as we take into account the meson form factor and the fact that one meson propagator is off - mass shell .",
    "we consider also the absorbtion correction comming from the diagram where both mesons ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 , or @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) directly interact with the target proton .",
    "the role of the interference in @xmath2 photo- and electroproduction is discussed in sect .",
    "3 . we will also consider in sect .",
    "4 the case of @xmath9 photo- and electroproduction which allows one , in principle , to extract the value of @xmath30 at high energies .",
    "the cross section of vector meson photo- and electroproduction may be written as : @xmath31 are the resonant and non - resonant parts of the production amplitude , @xmath32 for longitudinal and transverse photons , @xmath33 is the momentum transfered to the proton and @xmath34 , where @xmath9 and @xmath35 are the azimutal and polar angles between the @xmath26 and the proton direction in the @xmath25 rest frame .",
    "we will use the simple phenomenological parametrization of the production amplitude because our main aim is the discussion of the interference between resonant and non - resonant contributions .",
    "so the amplitude for resonant process @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass and the width of vector meson ; @xmath40 is the @xmath41-slope of the `` elastic '' @xmath42 production cross section @xmath43 ( at @xmath44 ) and the functions @xmath45 describe the angular distribution of the pions produced through the vector meson decay : @xmath46 @xmath47 note that for transverse photons with polarization vector @xmath48 one has to replace the last factor @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) by the scalar product @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the unit vector in the pion transverse momentum direction .",
    "the amplitude for the non - resonant process @xmath52 is : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath41-slope of the elastic @xmath13 cross section , @xmath55 is the pion electromagnetic form factor ( @xmath56 is the virtuality of the incoming photon ) , @xmath57 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath58  the photon momentum fraction carried by the @xmath27 -meson ; @xmath15 is the total pion - proton cross section .",
    "the factor @xmath59 is equal to @xmath60 for longitudinal photons the products @xmath61 are : @xmath62 and @xmath63 , while for the transverse photons we may put ( after averaging ) @xmath64 .",
    "expressions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are the result of straitforward calculation of the feynman diagram fig .",
    "the first term in ( 6 ) comes from the graph fig . 1 ( in which the pomeron couples to the @xmath26 ) and the second one reflects the contribution originated by the @xmath65 interaction .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath27 electric charge leads to the minus sign of the second term .",
    "we omit here the phases of the amplitudes .",
    "in fact , the common phase is inessential for the cross section , and we assume that the relative phase between @xmath66 and @xmath67 is small ( equal to zero ) as in both cases the phase is generated by the same pomeron exchange .",
    "the form factor @xmath68 is written to account for the virtuality ( @xmath69 ) of the t - channel ( vertical solid line in fig .",
    "1 ) pion . as in fig .",
    "1 we do not deal with pure elastic pion - proton scattering , the amplitude may be slightly suppressed by the fact that the incoming pion is off - mass shell . to estimate this suppression",
    "we include the form factor ( chosen in the pole form ) @xmath70 the same pole form was used for @xmath71 . in the last case",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is the mass of the @xmath11-meson , but the value of @xmath73 ( in @xmath68 ) is expected to be larger . in the case of @xmath74 production it should be of the order of mass of the next resonance from regge @xmath5-meson trajectory ; i.e. it should be the mass of @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "thus we put @xmath77 gev@xmath18 .",
    "finaly we have to define @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 in these notations @xmath82 and @xmath83 with the pion transverse ( with respect to the proton direction ) momentum @xmath84 ( in the @xmath25 rest frame ) given by expression @xmath85 .",
    "note that the positive values of @xmath86 correspond to @xmath87 while the negative ones @xmath88 correspond to @xmath89 .      to account for the screening correction we have to consider the diagram fig .",
    "2 , where both pions interact directly with the target . note that all the rescatterings of one pion ( say @xmath26 in fig",
    ". 1 ) are already included into the @xmath13 elastic amplitude .",
    "the result may be written in form of eq .",
    "( 5 ) with the new factor @xmath90 instead of the old one @xmath91 : @xmath92 where the second term is the absorptive correction ( fig .",
    "2 ) and @xmath93 is the momentum transfered along the pomeron loop .",
    "the factor @xmath94 reflects the contribution of the enhacement graphs with the diffractive exitation of the target proton in intermediate state . in accordance with the hera data @xcite , where the cross section of `` inelastic '' ( i.e. with the proton diffracted ) @xmath11 photoproduction was estimated as @xmath95 we choose @xmath96",
    "the situation with resonance @xmath2 is not clear .",
    "the enhancement in the four pion invariant mass distribution at @xmath97 gev which was considered as @xmath98 particle now can be considered @xcite as two interfering resonances , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 in the formulae below ) with masses 1.465 gev and 1.70 gev and widths 0.31 gev and 0.235 gev , respectively . however the presented formulae are valid for one - resonant production .",
    "the relative phase of the amplitudes of these resonances production is practically unknown .",
    "for these reason we will present the calculated results for two cases , one resonance with @xmath101 gev and @xmath102 mev @xcite , using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and two - resonances with the masses and widths presented above and with zero relative phase . in the last case we will use expression @xmath103 decay amplitude .",
    "the main aim of our calculations is to demonstrate the role of background contribution to the resulting @xmath104 distribution .",
    "the results at @xmath105 ( photoproduction ) for the cases of one - resonance and two - resonances production are shown in figs .",
    "3a and 3b . both slope parameters , @xmath106 in eq.(2 ) and @xmath54 in eq.(5 )",
    "were assumed to be equal to 10 gev@xmath107 .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to the resonant production contributions .",
    "they are normalized to the experimental @xmath2 to @xmath11 ratio in the two - pion final state ( i.e. the product of cross section ratio and @xmath108 branching ) that is equal to @xmath109 at @xmath105 @xcite and we assume that in the case of two - resonances production their production cross sections are equal .",
    "the values of two - pion branching ratios for these states were assumed to be 0.07 and 0.25 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the contributions of non - resonant production ( dotted curves ) and its interference with resonant one ( dash - dotted curves ) depend on the form factor @xmath68 , the screening corrections and the value of @xmath15 . here",
    "the form factor was used in the form eq.(7 ) with @xmath110 = 1.5 gev@xmath18 , screening correction in the form eq.(10 ) and the value of @xmath111 mb were used .",
    "production in the @xmath11 mass region of elastic photoproduction . ]",
    "the sum of all three contributions are presented by solid curves .",
    "one can see that the contributions of non - resonant and interference production dominate for the mass region of @xmath112 and the experimental enhancement in the two - pion mass distribution here is connected mainly with background and interference contributions as well as with possible `` tails '' from @xmath113 and @xmath114 production .",
    "this enhancement should be sensitive to the value of @xmath15 .    to demonstrate the role of the relative sign of resonant and non - resonant ( background ) production we present in figs . 3c and 3d the calculations with the positive sign of resonant contribution in eq .",
    "now we present in fig .",
    "3d the sum of two resonances and their interference by dashed curve , the sum of all resonant - background contributions by dash - dotted curve and background contribution by dotted curve .",
    "one can see that the shape of the summary curves ( solid ones ) are changed drastically in comparison with the cases of figs .",
    "3a and 3b , especially in the case of two - resonant production .",
    "we have considered also the process of @xmath74 production in the @xmath2 mass region with accounting the `` tail '' of @xmath22 contribution , i.e. using the expression latexmath:[\\[\\frac{d\\sigma^d}{dm^2dt}\\ ; = \\ ; \\int d\\omega \\ ;    the contributions of @xmath22 breit - wigner peak and its interference with background practically cancel at the used parameters ( on the level of @xmath116 90% ) the background contribution shown in figs .",
    "it means that @xmath74 production in the mass region , say 1.2 - 1.9 gev is determined practically only by one or two @xmath2 resonances .",
    "gev . ]    at very large @xmath117 the background amplitude eq.(5 ) becomes negligible as , even without the additional form factor ( i.e. at @xmath118 ) , the non - resonance cross section falls down as @xmath119 .",
    "one factor @xmath120 comes from the electromagnetic form factor @xmath121 and another one  from the pion propagator ( term - @xmath122 in the denominator of @xmath59 ( see eq.(6 ) ) . ]",
    "the results of our calculations of @xmath123 for @xmath117 = 10 gev@xmath18 using eq .",
    "( 1 ) for one @xmath2 resonance and eq . ( 11 ) for two resonances with form factor , eq.(7 ) , @xmath111 mb and with screening correction are presented in figs . 4a and 4b , respectively .",
    "they are normalized to the experimental @xcite @xmath2 to @xmath11 ratios ( @xmath124 for @xmath125 channel ) which were assumed to be equal to 0.8 for one @xmath126 resonance and to 0.4 at for both states , @xmath112 and @xmath114 .",
    "the pure resonant contributions ( the sum of two resonances and their interference in the case of fig .",
    "4b ) are shown by dashed curves ( we assume that the longitudinal contribution to the resonant production is equal to the transverse one ) and one can see that in both cases resonant production dominate .",
    "the contribution of @xmath22 here is small . for @xmath127",
    "gev the @xmath113 `` tail '' is 5 - 6 times smaller than the non - resonant @xmath0 background .",
    "in the case of @xmath9-meson photo- and electroproduction the corrections to the pure resonant production should be small because the resonant peak is very narrow . however their contribution should be investigated .",
    "we will consider the channel @xmath129 with branching ratio @xmath130% .",
    "the absolute normalization of the @xmath9 photoproduction cross section can be obtained by integration of @xmath1 mass distribution near the @xmath9 peak that should corresponds to the value @xmath131b @xcite . the value of @xmath132 parameter equal to 7 gev@xmath107 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath41-slope of the elastic @xmath9 photoproduction was used in agreement with data of @xcite . here the form factor @xmath68 , was used in the form eq.(7 ) with @xmath110 = 2 gev@xmath18 , that corresponds to the mass of the next resonance from regge @xmath6-meson trajectory .",
    "we take the value @xmath54 = 9 gev@xmath107 for @xmath41-slope in elastic @xmath133 cross section and @xmath30 = 24 mb for the total cross section of @xmath133 interactions .",
    "the results of calculations for the case of @xmath1 photoproduction are shown in fig .",
    "of course , resonant contribution dominates in the region of @xmath9 peak , however some interference contribution can be seen at the right - hand side of the `` tail '' .",

    "here we assumed that the longitudinal contribution to the resonant production is 1.5 times larger than the transverse one and one can see that the resonance production dominate .",
    "we presented simple formulae for the background to elastic @xmath2-meson and @xmath9 photo- and electroproduction which account for the absorptive correction and virtuality of the pion and kaon .",
    "the role of resonance  background interference is very significant for the case of @xmath74 pair photoproduction in the mass region of @xmath2-meson . due to some occacional reasons the `` tail '' of @xmath113",
    "is practically cancelled by background contribution . at large @xmath117 , say at @xmath135 gev@xmath18 , for the case of @xmath2 production the @xmath113 `` tail '' is rather small and the main background comes from non - resonant @xmath0 production . for the case of @xmath9 production background is small enough .",
