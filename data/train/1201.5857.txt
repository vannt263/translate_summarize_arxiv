    "<S> we simultaneously fit all six @xmath70-dependent responses to the solutions of the linearized sfhd equations ( propagated through tof without linearization , see supplementary information ) and extracted three free parameters : the phenomenological damping term @xmath95 , which is the diagonal part of the resistivity matrix in equation ; the effective trap frequency , @xmath96  hz ; and the drive strength @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter two parameters are in reasonable agreement with the directly measured quantities @xmath98 hz and @xmath99 .    </S>",
    "<S> while the above data are well - characterized by and are in good agreement with a sfhd description and its tof propagation , _ in situ _ measurements provide a clearer demonstration of hall physics . for different values of @xmath56 , we measured the becs time - dependent density profiles and calculated normalized second - order moments @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 from fits to skewed thomas - fermi distributions with radii @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( see supplementary information ) . as in fig .  [ fig : measurehall ] , the modulation drive frequency was @xmath105  hz .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : omegac ] shows the amplitude response of the normalized second order moments along with simultaneous fits to the linear - response predictions of sfhd using a single fit parameter , @xmath106 ( with the previously measured @xmath107 and @xmath1 as fixed parameters ) . for small @xmath56 , we find good agreement between our measurements and sfhd . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity of @xmath108 at high fields is caused by the shift of the @xmath74 resonance away from the fixed drive frequency @xmath70 as @xmath56 increases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for small @xmath56 , where the resonance is nearly constant , the slope of @xmath108 vs @xmath56 is a measure of the hall resistivity @xmath109 averaged over the cloud s changing density . the good agreement between our measurements and </S>",
    "<S> the irrotational sfhd model demonstrates the utility of this new hall technique as a simple , quantitative way to probe microscopic properties , like the superfluid hall resistivity , of a quantum degenerate gas . beyond @xmath110 , </S>",
    "<S> indications of vortices were evident in tof ; therefore , we expect that the predictions of vortex - free sfhd no longer apply . in the large-@xmath79 limit of `` diffused vorticity , ''  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> in which many vortices have entered the bec and `` ordinary '' fluid behaviour with @xmath111 is valid , calculations show that the superfluid hall signal approaches zero , but does not become negative as in some superconducting materials  @xcite .    inspired by condensed - matter techniques , we have demonstrated hall physics in a bec and showed that it is sensitive to the properties of an interacting , irrotational bec . </S>",
    "<S> this macroscopic hall measurement technique can be extended to probe the microscopic properties of more complicated ultracold configurations , such as 2d systems with vortices ( arising from thermal fluctuations  @xcite or synthetic magnetic fields  @xcite ) , systems with spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , and quantum hall systems  @xcite .    </S>",
