    "berry s geometric phase @xcite and its non - abelian generalization @xcite are ubiquitous phenomena in quantum physics when model parameters are adiabatically driven along a closed loop on the parameter space .",
    "they appear in a wide spectrum of physics and have applications in many disciplines , ranging from condensed matter physics to nuclear and high energy physics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new example of quantum mechanical models that exhibits nontrivial non - abelian geometric phase . in order to realize non - abelian geometric phase",
    ", we must at least have :    1 .",
    "degenerate energy levels ; and 2 .",
    "a certain number of ( experimentally controllable ) parameters .",
    "let us first look at the criterion ( i ) .",
    "as is well - known , degeneracies in energy levels are closely tied to symmetries of the systems .",
    "a typical example of such symmetries is time - reversal invariance , which results in the kramers degeneracy in fermi systems and plays an important role in geometric phase and/or topological invariants in molecular systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on yet another symmetry which induces spectral degeneracy : that is , _ supersymmetry _ , which also guarantees degenerate energy levels between `` bosonic '' and `` fermionic '' degrees of freedom of the system . rather than symmetries @xcite .",
    "in @xcite non - abelian geometric phase over the space of degenerate ground states has been studied in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics . ]",
    "let us next look at the criterion ( ii ) .",
    "a typical example of ( experimentally controllable ) parameters discussed in the context of geometric phase is electromagnetic field .",
    "here we would like to point out that generic point - like interactions may also serve the purpose , because point - like interactions are all known to be described by @xmath2 family of boundary conditions @xcite and characterized by @xmath3 independent continuous parameters .",
    "though , as far as we know , @xmath2 family of point - like interactions have not yet realized in laboratory experiments , they are completely allowed in quantum mechanics and hence will provide a promising ingredient of future nanotechnology .",
    "the aim of the paper is to present a canonical example of quantum mechanical models with point - like interactions that exhibits supersymmetry , spectral degeneracy , and nontrivial non - abelian geometric phase . as in any study of theoretical physics , it is tempting to construct a minimal model that captures all the essence of the ideas . in this paper",
    "we consider a single spinless particle on a circle of circumference @xmath4 that freely propagates in the bulk yet interacts only at the origin @xmath5 and its antipodal point @xmath6 , where @xmath5 and @xmath7 are identified .",
    "the bulk dynamics is governed by the schrdinger equation for a free particle @xmath8 point - like interactions , on the other hand , are all described by the boundary conditions consistent with _",
    "kirchhoff s law _ of probability current at @xmath5 and @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the local probability current ( with prime ( @xmath12 ) indicating the derivative with respect to @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 stand for the limits approaching @xmath15 from above and from below .",
    "the conditions are quadratic in wavefunctions , but they can be linearized and are known to enjoy the following @xmath2 family of solutions at each point @xcite :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 stands for the @xmath18 unit matrix and @xmath19 is an arbitrary length scale that needs to be introduced on account of dimensional analysis . equations and describe the most general point - like interactions in quantum mechanics consistent with kirchhoff s law of probability current , or , equivalently , self - adjointness of the free hamiltonian .",
    "the full parameter space of the model is thus @xmath20 . though energy levels are not degenerate in general , there",
    "indeed exists a subspace @xmath21 in which @xmath0 supersymmetry refers to the number of real ( i.e. self - adjoint ) supercharges . ]",
    "emerges and energy levels become doubly degenerate ( up to the question of ground state degeneracy ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the supersymmetric subspace @xmath22 is given by the following direct product : @xmath23 it can be shown that only the first factor controls the energy eigenvalues and the second factor does not affect the energy spectrum at all : the coset factor @xmath24 describes the isospectral family of the system and hence provides an ideal playground for studying geometric phase .",
    "the goal of the paper is to report that the berry connection on @xmath22 with fixed @xmath25 parameter is given by a magnetic monopole - like configuration in non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we construct @xmath0 supersymmetric quantum mechanics in this system and solve the energy eigenvalue problems .",
    "we then compute non - abelian berry s connection on the parameter space @xmath26 in section [ sec:3 ] and show that it is nothing but the wu - yang - like magnetic monopole in @xmath1 yang - mills gauge theory .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] is devoted to conclusions and discussions .    in the rest of the paper we will work in the units @xmath27 .",
    "the key to construct @xmath0 supersymmetric quantum mechanics for a free particle on a circle with two point - like interactions is to find the generic form of fermion parity operator @xmath28 , which should satisfy @xmath29 and have two eigenvalues @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in this section",
    "we first introduce @xmath28 in our model and then discuss point - like interaction invariant under supersymmetry transformations .",
    "we also explicitly construct @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra and solve the superspectrum in this model .      in the following discussions it is convenient to work in the so - called _ folding picture _ , which is just a change of viewpoint from `` scalar '' quantum mechanics ( i.e. quantum mechanics with scalar - valued wavefunction ) on a circle of circumference @xmath4 to `` vector '' quantum mechanics ( i.e. quantum mechanics with vector - valued wavefunction ) on an interval of length @xmath9 . to do this ,",
    "let us consider the wavefunction on the upper- and lower - semicircles separately and embed them into a single two - component vector - valued function as follows : @xmath32 ( throughout the paper we will use boldface symbols for vectors . )",
    "the boundary conditions and are then cast into the following forms :    @xmath33    here and hereafter we simply write @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the folding picture",
    "the hilbert space is @xmath38 and the free hamiltonian that acts on @xmath39 is given by the @xmath18 matrix - valued operator , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 . the boundary conditions and specify the most general self - adjoint domain of the matrix - valued operator @xmath42 .",
    "let us next introduce the fermion parity @xmath28 in this model .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , @xmath28 is given by the following hermitian unitary operator : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a generic @xmath18 hermitian unitary matrix satisfying @xmath45 , or @xmath46 .",
    "such hermitian unitary matrix is parameterized as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath49 is a real unit 3-vector fluffing the condition @xmath50 .",
    "the parameter space of @xmath44 is therefore 2-sphere @xmath51 , which turns out to provide the coset factor in the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "notice that the unitary transformation commutes with the hamiltonian and leaves the schrdinger equation unchanged .",
    "however , @xmath52 does not leave the boundary conditions and unchanged in general and hence is not a symmetry for generic point - like interactions .",
    "it is easy to show that the boundary conditions remain invariant under @xmath52 if and only if both @xmath53 and @xmath54 commute with @xmath44 , @xmath55 = [ \\tilde{u } , z ] = 0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the solutions to these conditions are parameterized as follows :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 are projection operators and @xmath58 are eigenphases of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the fermion parity @xmath59 becomes the symmetry of the system if and only if @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given by and . in this case @xmath59",
    "provides a good grading operator such that the hilbert space splits into two orthogonal subspaces , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are `` bosonic '' and `` fermionic '' sectors of the model .",
    "correspondingly , any element @xmath62 of the hilbert space @xmath39 is decomposed as follows : @xmath63 where @xmath64 here @xmath65 are orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath44 that satisfy the eigenvalue equations @xmath66 , the orthonormality @xmath67 and the completeness @xmath68 .",
    "notice that the projection operators can also be written as @xmath69 .",
    "in what follows we will call the set of eigenvectors @xmath70 the basis and @xmath71 the components .",
    "it is easy to check that the @xmath52-invariant boundary conditions completely decouple into the `` bosonic '' and `` fermionic '' parts and the components @xmath72 satisfy the following robin boundary conditions :    @xmath73      let us next introduce supersymmetry transformations . to this end",
    ", let us first introduce the following one - parameter family of first - order differential operators : @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "an important observation is that the free hamiltonian @xmath41 is factorized as @xmath76 such that the schrdinger equations @xmath77 can be written as @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which imply the following relations :    @xmath80    these equations give the supersymmetry transformations that map the `` bosonic '' state @xmath81 to the `` fermionic '' state @xmath82 and vice versa .",
    "it should be emphasized that the robin boundary conditions and are not invariant under these transformations for generic values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the boundary conditions invariant under the supersymmetry transformations are classified in @xcite , and it is shown that there are four distinct supersymmetric boundary conditions , which are summarized in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we note that the supersymmetric boundary conditions admit only one parameter @xmath85 , which is an angle parameter and provides the @xmath25 factor in .",

    "let us first work in the basis in which the fermion parity becomes diagonal .",
    "in that basis the wavefunction becomes @xmath99 such that the operators @xmath42 , @xmath28 and @xmath97 are given by the following standard forms :    @xmath100    these operators satisfy the @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra with the trivial central extension    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the trivial center that commutes with all the operators . in a generic basis , these operators that act on the hilbert space @xmath38 are given by @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a generic @xmath18 hermitian unitary matrix that satisfies the anticommutation relation @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "it should be noted that , under the supersymmetric boundary conditions , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are indeed adjoint to each other such that the combination @xmath111 becomes positive semidefinite . in other words ,",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath112 is bounded from below , @xmath113 , and the lower bound is saturated by the zero - modes of @xmath97 .      in order to compute berry s connection explicitly we have to know the spectrum and normalized energy eigenfunctions @xmath114 .",
