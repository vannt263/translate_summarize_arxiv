    "since the early years of superconductivity studies it has been noticed that any superconducting transition @xmath0 always has a finite width .",
    "very often sample inhomogeneity is the dominating factor .",
    "however with refinement of fabrication methodology it became clear that even in the most homogeneous samples the @xmath0 transition is not infinitely narrow .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath0 dependence is most pronounced in systems with reduced dimensions where the thermodynamic fluctuations have a larger effect . in particular case of quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) channels fluctuation - driven phase slips ,",
    "the concept first introduced by w. little in 1967 @xcite , are responsible for the finite resistivity in a narrow region below the critical temperature @xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the condensation energy of the smallest statistically independent volume of the wire . soon after formulation of the model @xcite experiments",
    "@xcite confirmed the validity of the concept of the thermally activated phase slips ( taps ) .    at lower temperatures the number of thermally activated phase slips",
    "is exponentially suppressed and no resistance should be expected well below the critical temperature .",
    "however later experiments @xcite in extremely narrow superconducting nanowires have demonstrated the finite resistance even at temperatures @xmath3 .",
    "the effect has been associated with quantum fluctuations of the order parameter , alternatively called _ quantum phase slips _ ( qps ) @xcite .",
    "yet another confirmation of the qps reality came from the experiments studying the persistent current in nanorings @xcite resulting in building a quantum two level system - qubit @xcite .",
    "though the quantum fluctuation phenomenon has already received the experimental confirmation from several independent sources , the physics behind is still under debates .",
    "of special interest are the recent theoretical developments predicting that a qps junction is dual to a josephson junction @xcite .",
    "contrary to conventional transport measurements with low - ohmic contacts @xcite , if a nanowire governed by qpss ( qps junction ) is truly current biased , then one should expect the development of the insulating state - the coulomb blockade @xcite in a full accordance with a josephson junction in the regime of bloch oscillations @xcite    the mandatory pre - requisites of such a non - trivial experimental configuration is the high enough rate of qpss being of the same order as the experimentally observed coulomb gap .",
    "contrary to such a sample current biased through high - ohmic electrodes , similar superconducting nanowire of the same diameter , but with low - ohmic probes ( e.g. superconducting ) , should not demonstrate the coulomb gap , but its @xmath0 and @xmath4 dependencies should show no traces of conventional superconductivity either .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study exactly the limit of extremely narrow nanowires where the qps rate is high enough to significantly affect the transport properties .",
    "the impact of the quantum fluctuations on the shape of the superconducting transition is qualitatively described by expression , similar to the taps expression , @xcite @xmath5 , where instead of the thermal energy @xmath6 stands the rate of qps @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the normal state resistance , @xmath9 is the superconducting quantum resistance , @xmath10 is the length of the wire , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the temperature - dependent superconducting energy gap and coherence length .",
    "@xmath13 is the qps action , where constant @xmath14 is of the order of unit and can not be more precisely defined from the theory @xcite .",
    "it is the only true fitting parameter of the model , other parameters can be derived from the experimental data . for our dirty limit  samples @xmath15 the superconducting coherence length can be estimated as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the coherence length in the clean limit @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the fermi velocity . utilizing the text - book expression for the normal state resistance of a wire with cross - section @xmath20 , length @xmath10 and resistivity @xmath21",
    ", one comes to a conclusion that the effective resistance of a qps - governed system exponentially depends on the sample parameters @xmath22 .",
    "hence thin nanowires of low-@xmath23 superconductors with high resistivity ( in normal state ) are of advantage for observation of a pronounced contribution of the qps effect .",
    "it should be noted that the model @xcite is based on the assumption that quantum fluctuations are relatively rare events . or in other terms , the corresponding qps - related effective resistance of the nanowire should be much smaller than the normal state resistance @xmath24 .",
    "as it comes from the formulated above objective of the paper , the limit of strong fluctuations violates this requirement .",
    "unfortunately , to our best knowledge , the limit of strong quantum fluctuations has not yet been properly treated theoretically .",
    "hence , the expression ( [ eq1 ] ) can be considered only as a certain guideline . as it will be shown below , indeed when",
    "the contribution of the qps effect on the shape of the @xmath0  transition is already noticeable , the further reduction of the nanowire cross - section @xmath20 leads to complete flattening of the @xmath0 dependence not described by the model @xcite .",
    "the research related to mesoscopic superconducting is limited by the fabrication technology . in particular case of qps effect , to reach the regime of interest @xmath25",
    "the nanowire should have very small cross - section .",
    "for example for aluminum the cross - section below 10 nm ( still maintaining the high level of uniformity ! ) is mandatory @xcite .",
    "following eq .",
    "( 1 ) , for materials like nb , sn or pb with relatively high critical temperature one gets even more pessimistic estimations approaching 1 nm scale .",
    "this note explains why in particular case of niobium no traces of the qps effect have been observed down to 7 nm scales @xcite . with proper material selection",
    "the extremely tough fabrication requirements can be somehow relaxed . from our previous studies",
    "we have already learnt that in titanium the qps effect is observable at sub-40 nm scales @xcite , which is achievable with the standard e - beam lithography technique .",
    "in addition , titanium is an easy to work material and the extended microscopic and elemental analysis reveals no severe structural defects or / and impurities @xcite . for the purpose of the present work we prepared several titanium nanowires with length @xmath26 and the effective diameter @xmath27 between 27 and 48 nm .",
    "the structures were fabricated with the standard lift - off e - beam lithography , and the titanium was deposited in uhv e - beam evaporator at residual pressure @xmath28 mbar . the substrate covered with exposed pmma",
    "/ maa mask was cleaned with low - energy @xmath29 plasma immediately before the metal evaporation .",
    "based on the measured resistivity @xmath30 @xmath31 , which is comparable with the tabulated value for the clean bulk titanium , the quality of the metal thin film is acceptable .",
    "previous tem and tof - erda analyses of titanium nanostructures fabricated using identical conditions and parameters confirmed the high material quality : the highest concentration of foreign inclusions inside the titanium matrix corresponds to @xmath32 @xmath33 of oxygen @xcite .",
    "this low concentration of impurities , combined with tem analysis , disables any speculations about the presence of sample inhomogeneities capable to significantly broaden the @xmath0 dependence .",
    "the spm analysis of the studied samples ( figure 1 ) confirmed the standard sample quality with the surface roughness of about several nm @xcite . the mean free path @xmath34  for the wire can be evaluated from the measured normal state resistance @xmath8  and the known material constant @xmath35 varying slightly in different literature sources . for our samples",
    "estimations give the mean free path @xmath36 1 to 2 nm .",
    "the result agrees well with the spm and tem measured grain size of roughly 2 to 3 nm .",
    "substrate.,width=302 ]    the @xmath0 measurements ( figure 2 ) were made employing the conventional four - probe configuration using 7 hz lock - in technique at rather small excitation currents of about 50 pa .",
    "the experiments were made in @xmath37 dilution refrigerator with the base temperature down to 17 mk .",
    "all input / output lines were carefully protected from the noisy electromagnetic environment utilizing multi - stage rlc filtering enabling the electron temperature @xmath3835 mk at a base ( phonon ) temperature @xmath3820 mk @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently thick nanowires with the effective diameter @xmath39 40 nm the shape of the @xmath0 dependencies follows our earlier findings : pronounced superconducting transition with  the low temperature data @xmath40 which can be described by the qps model @xcite with the realistic set of fitting parameters @xcite .  however the thinner the sample , the less the resistance @xmath0 drops below the certain critical temperature ( figure 2 ) .",
    "it should be noted that for titanium the critical temperature @xmath23 decreases with the decrease of the cross - section @xmath20 .",
    "the size dependence of the critical temperature for low dimensional superconductors is a well - known effect , though the commonly accepted explanation of the phenomenon still does not exist @xcite .",
    "thus the accurate experimental definition of the critical temperature for the thinnest samples @xmath41 , necessary for the theory fitting ( equation [ eq1 ] ) , is rather problematic due to the strongly broadened @xmath0 transition .",
    "nevertheless for the thinnest samples @xmath42 35 nm no set of realistic qps model parameters can fit the experimental data ( figure 2 ) . for these ultra - thin samples",
    "the experimental @xmath0 dependency is so weak , that the model @xcite applicability criterion @xmath43 is not satisfied down to the lowest experimentally obtainable temperatures .",
    "and the effective diameters indicated in the inset .",
    "model @xcite calculations using the realistic fitting parameters @xmath44 1 nm , @xmath45=1.79@xmath46 m / s , @xmath14=0.098 and the critical temperature @xmath23=200 mk and 115 mk for the 37 nm and 32 nm samples , respectively , are plotted with dashed lines .",
    "best fit @xmath23 s are indicated with arrows .",
    "clearly the model @xcite , applicable in the limit @xmath43 ,  fails to provide any acceptable fits for the thinnest samples @xmath0 data.,width=302 ]    at temperatures well - below the critical temperature @xmath3 the @xmath47 dependencies ( figure 3 ) for the thickest studied samples demonstrate the conventional destruction of the zero - resistance state by current with the well - pronounced critical current @xmath48 .",
    "the double shape of the transition ( e.g. at @xmath3822 na and @xmath3828 na for the 48 nm sample ) presumably originates from slightly different effective cross - section of the samples at the node regions . with decrease of the nanowire cross - section ,",
    "as expected from the @xmath0 dependencies , the the zero - resistance state disappears and only some residual critical current peculiarities can be traced . in the thinnest samples the zero - biased differential resistance @xmath49  very slightly increases indicating the presence of a weak coulomb blockade .",
    "observation of a pronounced coulomb effects requires the true current biasing ( including the high frequencies ! ) @xcite and this experimental realization is not within the scope of the present paper .",
    ", as function of the bias current i for the same four samples as in figure 2 .",
    "the data for the 48 nm nanowire ( open right - pointing triangles ) have been collected at 80 mk , while for the other three samples - at 20 mk . for clarity",
    "the curves are vertically shifted .",
    "the scale corresponding the normal state resistance @xmath8 is indicated with vertical bar.,width=302 ]    yet one more interesting observation is the negative magnetoresistance ( nmr ) which is observed in the thinnest samples with pronounced qps contribution ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the effect increases with lowering the temperature .",
    "similar phenomenon has been reported in aluminum @xcite , niobium and @xmath50 @xcite and lead @xcite nanowires . the origin of the nmr in these quasi-1d channels is still under debates . in case of niobium and @xmath50",
    "it was conjected that some rogue magnetic moments might be present , and their pair breaking contribution , active at lower magnetic fields , is suppressed by higher fields leading to the observed nmr @xcite .",
    "however this mechanism needs an independent proof of the existence of these magnetic moments , and can not explain the nmr in such material as aluminum @xcite , where it is a well - known fact that majority of magnetic impurities can obtain a non - negligible magnetic moment only at relatively high concentrations @xcite .",
    "another explanation of the nmr phenomenon deals with the magnetic field suppression of the charge imbalance accompanying each phase slip event @xcite .",
    "somehow related mechanism , capable to provide nmr , deals with more effective suppression of superconductivity in ( wider ) electrodes affecting the phase slip formation in the ( thinner ) nanowire @xcite .",
    "measured at zero magnetic field ( filled triangles ) and in perpendicular magnetic field b = 5.6 mt ( open circles ) .",
    "both data were obtained while the same slow temperature sweep just by switching on and off the magnetic filed .",
