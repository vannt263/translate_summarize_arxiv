    "novel physical effects in dielectric media with both negative permittivity and negative permeability were first analyzed theoretically by veselago @xcite who predicted a number of unusual phenomena including , for example , negative refraction of waves .",
    "such media are usually known as _ left - handed ( lh ) media _ since the electric and magnetic fields form a left handed set of vectors with the wave vector .",
    "the physical realization of such lh media was demonstrated only recently @xcite for a novel class of engineered composite materials , now called _",
    "lh metamaterials_. such lh materials have attracted attention not only due to their recent experimental realization and a number of unusual properties observed in experiment , but also due to the expanding debates on the use of a slab of a lh metamaterial as a perfect lens for focusing both propagating and evanescent waves @xcite .",
    "the concept of a perfect lens was first introduced by pendry @xcite , who suggested the idea that a slab of a lossless negative - refraction material can be used for creating a perfect image of a point source .",
    "although the concept of a perfect lens is a result of an ideal theoretical model employed in the analysis  @xcite , the resolution limit of a lh slab was shown to be independent of the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave ( but can be determined by other factors including losses , spatial dispersion , and others ) , so that the resolution can be indeed much better than the resolution of a conventional lens @xcite .",
    "the improved resolution of a lh slab and the corresponding amplification of evanescent modes even in a lossy lh material , can be understood from simple physics .",
    "indeed , the near field of an image , which can not be focused by a normal lens , can be transferred through the slab of a lh material due to the excitation of _ surface waves _ ( or surface polaritons ) at both interfaces of the slab .",
    "therefore , as the first major step in the understanding of the amplified transmission of the evanescent waves , as well as other unusual properties of the lh materials , it is important to study the properties of different types of surface wave that can be excited at the interfaces between lh and conventional ( or right - handed , rh ) media . some preliminary studies in this direction included calculation of the _ linear _ dispersion properties of modes localized at a single interface or in a slab of lh material @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a comprehensive study of the properties of both _ linear and nonlinear surface waves _ at the interface between semi - infinite materials of two types , left- and right - handed ones , and demonstrate a number of unique features of surface waves in lh materials . in particular , we show the existence of surface waves of both te and tm polarizations , a specific feature of the rh / lh interfaces .",
    "we study in detail te - polarized nonlinear surface waves and suggest an efficient way for engineering the group velocity of surface waves using the nonlinearity of the media .",
    "the dispersion broadening of the pulse can be compensated by the nonlinearity , thus leading to the formation of surface - polariton solitons at the rh / lh interfaces with a distinctive vortex - like structure of the energy flow .",
    "we must note here , that the presented study is based on the effective medium approximation , which treats the lh materials as homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "it can be applied to the manufactured metamaterials , which possess negative dielectric permittivity and negative permeability in the microwave frequency range , when the characteristic scale of the variation of the electromagnetic field ( e.g. a field decay length and a wavelength of radiation ) is much higher , than the period of the metamaterial .",
    "the possibility of preparing isotropic lh materials was studied in @xcite , where the isotropy of the composite in 2d has been shown . to obtain a negative - refraction material in optics",
