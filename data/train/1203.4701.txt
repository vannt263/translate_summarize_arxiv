    "a number of new network - based techniques for nonlinear time series analysis have been proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "the first class of these methods makes use of graph representations of certain similarity relationships between state vectors or groups of state vectors ( e.g. , cycles ) in phase space .",
    "it includes transition networks based on a coarse - graining of phase space  @xcite , cycle networks  @xcite , correlation networks  @xcite , @xmath1-nearest - neighbor  @xcite , and adaptive nearest neighbor networks  @xcite as well as @xmath0-recurrence networks  @xcite .",
    "the latter three techniques harness the fundamental analogy between the poincar recurrence structure  @xcite of a time series in phase space , which is commonly represented by a binary recurrence matrix and allows us to recover basic dynamical invariants of the underlying system  @xcite , and the binary adjacency matrix describing a complex network .",
    "other methods such as visibility graphs  @xcite work in the time domain and focus on studying stochastic properties of time series . aside from these network - based approaches for investigating ( possibly multivariate ) time series from isolated dynamical systems",
    ", efforts have been spent for developing techniques for studying fields of time series such as functional brain networks  @xcite in the neurosciences or climate networks  @xcite in climatology . in summary ,",
    "all methods mentioned above propose a mapping from the time series to the network domain and then proceed to interpret the statistical properties of the resulting ( usually complex ) network in terms of the underlying system s dynamical properties .",
    "while these interpretations are mostly based on empirical findings for paradigmatic model systems and heuristic arguments , only a few rigorous results are available .",

    "these can in turn be calculated analytically for paradigmatic model systems with smooth and self - similar geometry and are approximated by the corresponding discrete @xmath0-recurrence network measures .",
    "notably , most kinds of time series networks proposed so far are spatial networks  @xcite , since vertices are embedded either in phase space or on the time axis , implying that general results obtained for this class of networks are applicable to time series networks as well .",
    "recently , @xmath0-recurrence networks have been demonstrated to be a particularly useful tool in diverse applications of nonlinear time series analysis ranging from model systems  @xcite via experimental data  @xcite to recent and paleo - climate records  @xcite as well as financial time series  @xcite .",
    "they allow us to uncover complex bifurcation scenarios  @xcite and to reliably distinguish between chaotic and non - chaotic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the local and global transitivity characteristics of @xmath0-recurrence networks have been shown to enable us to trace unstable periodic orbits  @xcite and to define alternative notions of fractal dimension  @xcite independently of earlier approaches .",
    "an important advantage of nonlinear @xmath0-recurrence - network - based time series analysis is that it performs well with significantly shorter time series ( @xmath6 data points  @xcite ) than required by classical techniques like estimating the maximum lyapunov exponent from data  @xcite .",
    "this renders @xmath0-recurrence networks readily applicable to the analysis of non - stationary real world data .",

    ". given univariate observational or experimental time series , it is usually necessary to reconstruct the corresponding system s trajectory in some higher dimensional phase space to recover its recurrence structure reliably ( e.g. , by time - delay embedding  @xcite ) .    within the recurrence network , vertices represent observations or state vectors in phase space , while edges indicate a close proximity between two state vectors .",
    "recurrence networks and their statistical properties are related , but complementary to the established concepts of recurrence plots ( the recurrence matrix is given by @xmath14 ) and recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to rqa , which considers temporal dependencies between observations in form of diagonal and vertical line structures in the recurrence plot , recurrence network analysis discards all temporal information and solely quantifies the geometry of the underlying set @xmath4 ( e.g. , an attractor )  @xcite .",
    "given the diverse and successful applications of @xmath0-recurrence network analysis reported in the literature , it is important to establish a firm theoretical foundation for advancing the understanding of the method .",
    "building on earlier work  @xcite , we propose here an analytical framework for @xmath0-recurrence network analysis of time series encompassing neighborhood - based transitivity measures , mesoscopic measures relying on network motifs  @xcite , path - based network characteristics as well as spectral and random walk - based measures .",
    "specifically , our theory describes all graph - theoretical recurrence network quantifiers that have been used in the literature so far  @xcite . beyond forming a solid theoretical basis for this modern nonlinear approach to time series analysis and fostering its detailed understanding in a way comparable to that of standard linear time series analysis  @xcite , our analytical framework opens several avenues for practically improving the method when dealing with finite ( real - world ) time series : ( i )",
    "we are able to obtain closed - form analytical results for paradigmatic model systems with stochastic ( uniform and gaussian noise ) and deterministic ( periodic , quasi - periodic , and chaotic ) dynamics .",
