    "it is always pleasant to have a solution of a differential equation in a closed form which permits both to investigate general properties of the solution and perform numerical calculations . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "such a closed representation is the solution of the nonstationary schroedinger equation in the form of the feynman path or functional integral . in this direction ,",
    "enormous work is performed and many monographs and textbooks are published ( see , for example , @xcite and so on ) . however , in quantum mechanics there are plenty important problems with fixed energy , which require solution of the stationary schroedinger equation . in particular , all scattering processes are described by the stationary schroedinger equation . at present , there are several approaches ( see @xcite ) , in which the representation of the solution of the nonstationary schroedinger equation in the path integral form is used to obtain scattering amplitudes    i would like to remind you what is the difference in the formulation of the scattering problem in the temporal and stationary quantum formalism in the case of rapidly decreasing potentials .    stationary picture .",
    "a potential decreases very rapidly so that it acts in some bounded region only . outside of this region particles can be considered as free ones .",
    "any scattering looks like : at large distances outside of potential influence there is a current of free particles in a plane wave form ( before scattering ) and in a spherical wave form ( after scattering ) . this physical picture is really realistic .",
    "nonstationary picture .",
    "it is supposed that in some infinitely past @xmath0 and some infinitely future @xmath1 the potential does not exist and all particles are free and are described by plane waves in all space .",
    "the potential is @xmath2switched on@xmath2 adiabatically in some past and then is @xmath2switched off@xmath2",
    "adiabatically in some future .",
    "a factor @xmath3 is introduced to describe this process mathematically .",
    "this procedure is called _ the hypothesis of switching on interaction_. this hypothesis is the basis of the scattering theory in quantum field theory .",
    "physically , this picture is not correct because any interaction can not be switched off . besides",
    ", in quantum field theory space - time regions , where interaction is absent , do not exist .",
    "however , as it turned out this approach works well .",
    "mathematically , this approach requires an accurate way to the limiting procedure @xmath4 , some rules should be formulated and some counter terms should be introduced .",
    "therefore , we consider the nonstationary picture as absolutely unnecessary to describe scattering in quantum mechanics .    in works",
    "@xcite , where the subsequent references can be found , the path integral method is applied to potential scattering in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics to get the representation of the scattering amplitude in the path integral form .",
    "the argumentation is based on the nonstationary picture of scattering where the hypothesis of switching on interaction plays an essential role .",
    "the temporal schroedinger equation is considered , the representation for the @xmath5-matrix as a transition amplitude from time @xmath6 to time @xmath7 is obtained .",
    "the @xmath8-matrix is extracted by using the corresponding @xmath9-functions .",
    "besides , all calculations on this way are quite cumbersome . from my point of view , this approach is not the best way to get scattering amplitudes .",
    "we will show that the desired representation can be obtained directly from the stationary schroedinger equation .",
    "after that the problem arises how to calculate the obtained path integral .",
    "the point is that we can calculate the gaussian integrals only .",
    "but our path integrals are not the gaussian type .",
    "all known calculation methods are reduced in any case to appropriate gaussian type integrals .",
    "thus , our problem consists of two points :    \\1 . to get a representation for scattering amplitudes in the form of the path integral using the stationary schroedinger equation ;    \\2 . to work out comparatively simple methods to evaluate the derived path integrals .",
    "our estimations of the path integrals are based on the uncertainty correlation , which is one of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is known that the uncertainty coordinate - time correlation permits us to evaluate qualitatively and semiquantitatively the spectrum of any hamiltonian .",
    "the main point is very simple .",
    "let a hamiltonian @xmath10 have a discrete spectrum . between the middle size of the region @xmath11 , where a particle oscillates , and the middle of its momentum @xmath12 the connection does exist @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a number of excited states .",
    "the spectrum can be evaluated qualitatively and semiquantitatively by formula @xmath15.\\ ] ]    in the scattering case , when particles belong to the continuous spectrum , and are free in principle , the phenomenon of the expansion of the wave packet takes place , i.e. the uncertainty of the coordinate increases as @xmath16 , when time @xmath17 increases .",
    "we shall see how this property of the wave packet can be used .",
    "so our problem is to get simple formulas for qualitative and semiquantitative estimation of the length of scattering and the cross section in the case of positive repulsing potentials with a large coupling constant using the path integral representation of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the born approximation is not applicable in these cases .",
    "we shall use the results of @xcite , where the representation of the solution of the stationary schroedinger equation in the path integral form is obtained .",
    "the scattering problem is formulated in the following way .",
    "a potential is supposed to be short - range one .",
    "the steady - state shroedinger equation @xmath18 should be solved for the continuous spectrum @xmath19 and the solution should satisfy the asymptotic boundary conditions for @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the desired scattering amplitude , which should be found .",
