    "the reduction in the magnitude of the peak at @xmath36 is attributed to the effect of the @xmath0 collinear contributions on the initial parton legs .",
    "these collinear terms provide the same event structure as the lowest order direct subprocess , viz . , a final - state photon and charm quark with equal but opposite transverse momenta , but their contribution is negative due to @xmath194 terms from the phase space and large logarithms of @xmath195 and @xmath196 from the @xmath197 and @xmath198 distributions ; @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the lower and upper edges of the bins around @xmath111 . on the other hand , away from collinear configurations , the @xmath201 subprocesses , listed in eq .",

    "the @xmath205 contribution is important at small values of @xmath46 , but it falls off more steeply with @xmath46 than the @xmath190 contribution .",
    "the contribution from the valence subprocess , @xmath206 , is negligible at small @xmath46 , but it overtakes the contribution of the @xmath190 subprocess at sufficiently large @xmath46 . owing to the fact the valence quarks carry significantly harder fractional momentum than the gluons and charm quarks , a major role for the valence subprocess",

    "in summary , we have computed the contributions through @xmath202 in perturbative qcd for inclusive associated production of a prompt photon and a charm quark at large values of transverse momentum in high energy hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the next - to - leading order terms alter the expected distribution in the ratio of the magnitude of the transverse momenta of the charm quark and prompt photon in an interesting and measurable fashion .",
