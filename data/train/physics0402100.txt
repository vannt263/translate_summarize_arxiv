    "time series of physiological origin very often display synchronous behavior .",
    "most likely , this is the result of collective behavior of a huge number of nonlinearly interacting elementary oscillators .",
    "different examples of this phenomenon , as well as models of it , can be found for example in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we address a further example , i.e. the relation between diastolic ( dap ) and systolic ( sap ) blood pressure signals in healthy subjects .",
    "the analysis of blood pressure fluctuations may provide significant information on the physiology and pathophysiology of the autonomic control of the cardiovascular function @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the synchronization of these signals is expected , though a detailed study of its features is apparently still lacking . in a previous paper @xcite it",
    "was noticed that dap and sap are characterized by a phase lag in the very low frequency band ( vlf ) .",
    "the analysis of @xcite uses fourier analysis , which is not particularly useful when non - stationary effects play a relevant role . in the present work",
    "we address two questions about the dap / sap relationship : is the phase lag depending on the frequency band ? is the phase lag connected to a causal relation between sap and dap ? to address these questions , we measured dap and sap signal in a number of healthy subject . studying the mutual interdependency between the two time series ,",
    "we conclude that there is not a causal relationship between dap and sap time series , i.e. none of the two is driver for the other .",
    "moreover , a significant phase delay is found , for healthy subjects , in the vlf band and in the high frequency ( hf ) band .",
    "the phase shift between dap and sap is positive in vlf band and negative in the hf band .",
    "this change of sign in the phase shift has its origin in the regulatory mechanisms of blood circulation .",
    "a physiological interpretation of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of our work ; however the hypothesis that synchronization results from the collective behavior of elementary nonlinear oscillators may offer a clue to its understanding . to exploit this idea we use below two well known models of coupled oscillators , the winfree model @xcite and the kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "winfree s paper @xcite on coupled oscillators provided one of the first tractable examples of a self - organizing system .",
    "winfree introduced an approximation that has become the standard approach to the study of ensembles of biological oscillators : in the weak coupling limit , amplitude variations could be neglected and the oscillators could be described only by their phases along their limit cycles .",
    "winfree also discovered that systems of oscillators with randomly distributed frequencies exhibit a remarkable cooperative phenomenon , reminiscent of a thermodynamic phase transition , as the variance of the frequencies is reduced .",
    "the oscillators remain incoherent , each running near its natural frequency , until a certain threshold is crossed .",
    "then the oscillators begin to synchronize spontaneously .",
    "winfree model was subsequently modified by kuramoto who provided an analytically solvable version of it @xcite .",
    "this field of study has been very active all along and the analysis of synchronization phenomena remains a thriving area of research , see @xcite for a review",
    ". having in mind our experimental findings on the sap / dap relation , we first examine in section [ win ] the phase shift between coupled oscillators in these models , once synchronization has been reached .",
    "we observe that there exists a simple linear dependence between phase shifts of synchronized oscillators and the difference between their natural frequencies .",
    "this phenomenon , to our knowledge never noticed before , offers a simple mechanism to describe the change of sign in the phase lag as the frequency band is changed . in section [ phy ]",
    "we describe the experimental data and analyze them using the theoretical approach of section [ win ] .",
    "moreover we discuss the problem of the causal relation between the dap / sap time series . finally in section [ conclu ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the winfree model is defined by the set of equations ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1it describes a set of @xmath2 coupled non linear oscillators , with coupling constant proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the phase of the @xmath5th oscillator ; @xmath6 describes a set of natural frequencies taken randomly from a distribution @xmath7 .",

    "in the previous equation @xmath14,@xmath15 . the phase diagram of the winfree model has been recently discussed @xcite .",

    "@xcite ; in any case @xmath21 .",
    "this means that all the oscillators are characterized by a common average frequency ( or rotation number ) @xmath22 .",
    "the winfree model can describe different sets of pulse - coupled biological oscillators , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we now wish to study the relation between the phase shift @xmath23 of a pair of oscillators and the difference of their natural frequencies @xmath24 .",

    "let us consider two time series : @xmath62 and @xmath63 , representing systolic and diastolic arterial pressure .",
    "data are from a population of 47 normal subjects ( mean age+/-sd : 54+/-8 years ) who underwent a 10 minutes supine resting recording of ecg and noninvasive arterial blood pressure ( by the finapres device ) , in the laboratory for the assessment of autonomic nervous sytem , s. maugeri foundation , scientific institute of montescano , italy . for each cardiac cycle ,",
    "corresponding values of sap and dap were computed and resampled at a frequency of 2 hz using a cubic spline interpolation . in fig . [ fig6 ]",
    "we report the time series of the systolic arterial pressure @xmath62 for one of the subjects examined in this study .",

    "we enlarge the statistical population with respect to @xcite , and evaluate the phases of signals by the analytic signal technique , which allows a better estimate .",

    "only @xmath78 synchronization has been examined and the two phases @xmath74 , @xmath75 coincide with the phases of the time series @xmath79 .",
    "phase synchronization is characterized by the appearance of peaks in the distribution of the phase difference . to evaluate the phase shift we have considered time intervals characterized by a constant phase difference between the two series : @xmath80 we find @xmath81 in the vlf band , i.e. in this band diastolic pressure anticipate systolic pressure .",
    "our analysis confirm the results of @xcite with a different method . on the other hand in the hf band ( in basal conditions )",
    "the phase shift is negative @xmath82 , which means that in this band the systolic pressure signal anticipates the diastolic one .",
    "these data are reported for all the 47 subjects in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that shows on the left the vlf band and on the right the hf band ( we have not reported data in the intermediate region lf band , as they are compatible with @xmath83 ) .",

    "these results mean that the different sets of oscillators producing the time series have different spectral properties . leaving aside the task of a physiologically - based modelization",
    "we now show that the results obtained in section [ win ] can shed light on this phenomenon . for the present application we use the winfree model .",
    "we present here a schematic view of phase shifts @xmath23 between the time series @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this picture is only qualitative and aims to reproduce the dependence of the sign of @xmath23 on the filter in frequency power spectrum . as such",
    ", the picture is not realistic and does not offer a physiologically - based model of the time series ; nevertheless it can shed light on oscillator dynamics underlying them .",
    "let us assume that the two oscillatory signals @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the result of the collective behavior of two sets of oscillators , sets @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "we assume that this collective behavior produces a systolic arterial pressure ( @xmath86 ) and diastolic arterial pressure ( @xmath87 ) time series .",
    "we assume that the oscillators in the set @xmath86 have natural frequencies in the domain @xmath88 , while frequencies for the set @xmath87 are in the domain @xmath89 .",

    ": @xmath95 would model the vlf and hf frequency bands .",
    "let us assume that the coupling among the oscillators having natural frequencies in the intervals @xmath92 and @xmath94 is modelled by the winfree model , i.e. by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",

    "there is no interaction between oscillators in the two bands , though a weak coupling would not alter the qualitative picture .",
    "we consider one value of @xmath3 ( @xmath98 in this case ) .",
    "the two sets of oscillators , one centered around the natural frequency @xmath17 ( set @xmath92 ) and the other around @xmath99 ( set @xmath94 ) become synchronized around two synchronization frequencies , @xmath100 hz e @xmath101 hz see fig.[bands ] ( left side ) .    correspondingly , on the right , we have two lines showing a linear dependence between @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "the two lines are almost completely superimposed , which shows a weak dependence on the average natural frequencies of the two sets . the interesting result however is related to our definition of vlf and hf bands .",
    "the vlf band is the result of the collective behavior of oscillators in the set @xmath92 . for them",
    "@xmath102 and therefore , on the basis of the results of section [ win ] , @xmath103 . on the other hand in the hf band , @xmath104 and therefore @xmath105 .",
    "this simple mechanism implies the effect of a change of sign between the two phases when one goes from the very low frequency to the high frequency .",
    "one might wonder if our data also show a casual dependence between the two time series . to address this issue",
    "we have considered the index @xmath106 that measures the nonlinear interdependency between two time series @xmath107 and @xmath108 , as described in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , from the time series @xmath109 and @xmath110 , one reconstructs delay vectors @xmath111 and @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the time index , @xmath114 is the embedding dimension , and @xmath115 denotes the time lag .",

    "the mean squared euclidean distance to its @xmath119 neighbors is defined as @xmath122 while the * y*-conditioned mean squared euclidean distance is defined by replacing the nearest neighbors by the equal time partners of the closest neighbors of @xmath121 , @xmath123 the interdependence measure is then defined as @xmath124 @xmath106 is an asymmetric quantity and the degree of asymmetry is connected to causal relationship between the two time series , in other words if @xmath106 is much greater than @xmath125 then we may conclude that y is driving x. on the other hand each of these values measures by its size the degree of interdependency , @xmath126 ( resp .",
    "@xmath127 ) meaning minimal ( resp .",
    "maximal ) interdependency .",
    "we evaluated these indexes both on the sap and dap time series @xmath62 , @xmath63 and on their phases @xmath128 , @xmath129 . in both cases",
    "the asymmetry was not significant , which means that there is no causal relationship between sap and dap time series ; however the results obtained with the phases are always much greater than those obtained with the full signals .",
    "quantitatively , the average values for the hf band are : @xmath130 , @xmath131 , which shows a very small asymmetry and , at the same time , a very small interdependency . as to the phases , we get @xmath132 , @xmath133 , which on the contrary shows a larger interdependency .",
    "similar results are obtained in vlf and lf bands .",
    "besides showing the absence of a causal relation , these results confirm that in these systems of oscillators the main source of information on the underlying structures resides in the dynamics of the phases .",
    "our results represent an original analysis of the relation between systolic / diastolic blood pressure , which completes previous studies @xcite .",
    "the measured delays between the oscillatory components of systolic and diastolic blood pressure time series , show a change of sign going from low to high frequencies.we have addressed it within the paradigm of coupled nonlinear synchronous oscillators .",
    "we have shown , using winfree and kuramoto models , that once synchronization is achieved , the phase delay between oscillators is determined by the underlying structure and we have found a linear relationship between oscillator phase shifts and the difference of their natural frequencies .",
    "we then used these results to describe our findings , that confirm that changes in the modulating factors of arterial pressure affect differently the systolic and diastolic pressure values @xcite .",
