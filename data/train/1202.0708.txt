    "laws of electrical circuits are drastically modified when mesoscopic systems are incorporated .",
    "a coherent conductor embedded into a circuit sees the imposed voltage by the generator reduced by a fluctuating voltage associated with the impedance of the surrounding electromagnetic environment .",
    "this gives rise to a current reduction with a pronounced non - linearity , called zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) : transfer of electrons becomes inelastic as they exchange photons with the electromagnetic environment .",
    "this phenomena , called the dynamical coulomb blockade ( dcb ) , has attracted a tremendous interest both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite nevertheless , most of the works have been initially developed by focusing on the limit of a weakly transmitting conductor , i.e. , the tunneling regime.@xcite more recently , interest in the regime of few well - transmitting channels has emerged . on one hand , reducing the number of channels makes more apparent the effect of the circuit , as many channels could play as well the role of an out - of - equilibrium environment .",
    "on the other hand , highly transmitting conductors raise two interesting questions .",
    "first , whether the charge fluctuations wash out the dcb , and second , whether the reduction in the current is related to shot noise in the absence of the environment .",
    "indeed , this intuitive and attractive relation had been proposed through a perturbative computation with respect to a very weak impedance , and has been checked experimentally.@xcite nevertheless , its validity domain is restricted to high enough energies , as logarithmic divergences arise : one needs to go beyond the weak feedback action .",
    "this was particularly the case for an ohmic environment , i.e. , having an impedance @xmath4 at frequencies @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the resistance and @xmath7 the capacitance ) : this situation has not only relevance to realistic experiments but also a fundamental interest , being related to the investigation of electronic interactions .",
    "the logarithmic divergences have been resumed using a renormalization group ( rg ) scheme by kindermann and nazarov,@xcite dealing again with @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the quantum of resistance .",
    "it has been nevertheless possible , in a simultaneous and independent work , to deal for the first time with an arbitrary value of @xmath6 : one of the authors , with saleur , @xcite has shown that the problem of a short - coherent conductor in series with a resistance @xmath6 is equivalent to the impurity problem in a tomonaga - luttinger liquid@xcite ( tll ) with an interaction parameter : @xmath9 when specified to the limit of small @xmath6 , this mapping had led to recover the same results as those by kindermann and nazarov .",
    "these findings answer the two questions addressed above .",
    "first , the dcb still persists at good transmission , showing up below an energy scale @xmath10 ( depending in a non - universal way on @xmath6 and on transmission ) : it corresponds to the crossover voltage between the so - called weak backscattering ( wbs ) regime at high energy and strong backscattering ( sbs ) regime at low energy.@xcite secondly , the reduction in the current is related to the noise in the presence of the environment , and not to the noise of the isolated conductor as stated before ( see eq .",
    "( [ crucial ] ) ) .",
    "recent pioneering experiments by pierre s group@xcite  where the strong feedback of an arbitrary impedance on a one - channel edge state has been investigated for the first time  has shown satisfactory agreement with the theoretical predictions of refs .   and .",
    "interestingly , even though one has to take strictly the limit of one channel in ref .",
    ", the equivalence to a tll thus established seems to extend to many channels when they are treated in a mean - field framework , provided one renormalizes the parameter @xmath11 by including the resistance of the channels , and scales the voltage appropriately , as one can infer from a more recent study.@xcite    by mapping a one - channel conductor in series with an ohmic environment to a tll , the parameter @xmath11 of which can be controlled by tuning @xmath6 ( see eq .",
    "( [ key ] ) ) , one gets as well a promising alternative to test the theoretical predictions for the impurity problem in a tll . indeed , satisfactory experimental evidence has been lacking , even though partial success has been claimed to be obtained . in particular , as noticed in ref .",
    ", the case of an environmental resistance equal to the quantum of resistance , @xmath12 , corresponds to a tll with an interaction parameter @xmath2 . in that case",
    ", the impurity problem in a tll can be solved exactly in a more transparent way compared to other values of @xmath11 ( see ref .",
    "for instance ) .",
    "such an apparent simplicity is due to the introduction of new chiral fermions which arise from a mathematical construction without any physical entity , and incorporate non - trivial strong correlation effects .",
    "the non - perturbative investigation has a fundamental interest : it explores crucial issues not reached through perturbative approaches .",
    "nevertheless , the situation with @xmath2 has never been achieved experimentally .",
    "indeed , the ideal candidate to investigate the tll s behavior is usually provided by edge states with a constriction in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) . however , as @xmath11 plays the role of the fractional filling factor @xmath13 , and as the description of the edges in terms of one - channel chiral tll model is valid only for simple values : @xmath14 with @xmath15 an integer , it has not been possible to achieve a chiral tll with @xmath2 .",
    "other potential candidates are provided by quantum wires and carbon nanotubes .",
    "however three main difficulties arise in those systems :",
    "( i ) achieving only one backscattering center ; ( ii ) tuning the interaction parameter @xmath11 ; and ( iii ) taking into account the connection to reservoirs and finite size effects , where only a perturbative treatment of the impurity has been possible.@xcite thus , a coherent one - channel conductor connected to a quantum of resistance @xmath12 , as achieved recently,@xcite offers an unique opportunity to explore the properties of a tll with an impurity at @xmath2 .",
    "the specific value , @xmath2 , is exciting as it allows us to obtain handy analytic expressions for dc current and the zero - frequency noise . beyond the stationary regime ,",
    "time - dependent transport probes even more the dynamics and tests in a precise way the underlying model .",
    "this is the case of finite - frequency ( ff ) noise . in view of the mapping in ref .",
    ", one can use previous results obtained in the fqhe . on the one hand , as far as the ff symmetrized noise is concerned , chamon _",
    "et  al._@xcite have computed it perturbatively with respect to the impurity strength , and non - perturbatively at the specific value @xmath2 . on the other hand , within the framework of the exact solution of ref .  ,",
    "lesage and saleur@xcite have obtained only its behavior for low frequencies or close to the `` josephson '' singularity @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the voltage and @xmath18.@xcite notice that both approaches disagree , apart from the particular value @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , it has been possible to measure experimentally the ff non - symmetrized noise@xcite , which is more interesting to explore .",
    "it can be inferred from ref .",
    "dealing with edge states at simple filling factors , both in the wbs and sbs regimes : the same results apply to a coherent conductor with a good bare transmission @xmath19 connected to an arbitrary resistance at high or low enough energies , as well as for a low transmission.@xcite our aim is to go beyond this perturbative computation , offering a full description extending over all energy ranges below @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the frequency cutoff associated to the fermionic degrees of freedom in the conductor .",
    "this is precisely possible at @xmath12 .",
    "thus , our study gives the first non - perturbative results for the ff non - symmetrized noise , without assuming neither weak resistance , nor high or low enough energies associated to the wbs nor sbs regimes .",
    "in addition , this offers a benchmark for other values of the resistance .",
    "one of the key steps within the refermionization procedure is that the chiral independent fermions have now an energy - dependent transmission amplitude @xmath22 ( see eq .",
    "( [ tomega ] ) ) which encodes the non - trivial many - body correlations . indeed , the associated transmission coefficient @xmath23 has nothing to do with the effective transmission obtained for @xmath24 by the rg approach,@xcite and can not be obtained adiabatically from that in the absence of interactions , @xmath19 .",
    "it has been widely accepted that transport properties of the system can be obtained within the scattering approach using @xmath22 .",
    "this was shown to be valid both for the dc current , as well as for the full counting statistics ( fcs).@xcite surprisingly , our study shows that the scattering approach fails when one deals with time - dependent transport : the ff noise can still be expressed in terms of @xmath22 , nevertheless it obeys a different relation .",
    "the same feature occurs for another quantity : the out - of - equilibrium ff dissipative conductance @xmath25 $ ] which depends on the applied dc voltage and the frequency of the superimposed modulation , in addition to its implicit dependence on temperature .",
    "this last quantity has started to be studied only recently in few correlated systems , where its interest has been shown : quantum wires with an impurity@xcite and kondo problem.@xcite this has become possible owing to a crucial result : @xmath26 $ ] is given by an out - of - equilibrium kubo type formula , i.e. , by the asymmetry between the emission and absorption ff noise.@xcite in this present and first non - perturbative investigation , we show that @xmath26 $ ] does not fit with its expression obtained within the scattering approach .",
    "even more , it obeys exactly a surprising relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq_g_i ] ) , which determines it fully from the dc current , in a way similar to that obtained in tunnel junctions within the tien - gordon theory , but with a renormalized charge here.@xcite recently , such a relation has been generalized to full extent , including arbitrary interactions : it has been shown to be universal to lowest order with respect to a local or spatially extended tunneling at arbitrary dimension , as well as with respect to local or spatially extended backscattering if one - dimensional systems are considered.@xcite    notice that our results will depend on parameters such as the frequency cutoff @xmath27 , an effective transmission we call @xmath28 , and the voltage scale @xmath29 , which is related in a non - universal way to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that the scaling laws , known to be obeyed by the dc current , can be extended to the ff conductance and ff noise .",
    "more precisely , all these quantities depend only on @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the temperature .",
    ".synthesis of the abbreviations .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the important effective parameter is indeed the scaling voltage @xmath29,@xcite which appears in the bethe - ansatz solution as non - universal.@xcite it can be roughly related to the backscattering amplitude through @xmath34 .",
    "indeed @xmath29 characterizes the crossover between the wbs and sbs regimes . at energies high enough compared to @xmath10 , one can use the perturbative rg analysis with respect to a weak impurity by kane and fisher.@xcite in the opposite limit ( i.e. , at energies @xmath35 ) the wire is cut into two pieces , with weak tunneling between them .",
    "thus , even though one starts from a weak impurity , lowering the energy drives the system from the wbs behavior , where the conductance is slightly reduced , into the sbs regime where the conductance is suppressed .",
    "this means that the dcb still takes place even when the effective transmission @xmath28 is close to one,@xcite but below an effective charging energy @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , at energies much smaller than @xmath10 , thus in the sbs regime , it has been shown that one recovers the @xmath36 theory which is rather obtained starting from a very weak transmission.@xcite even more , it is possible to obtain non - perturbative results not only with respect to @xmath6 , but also to @xmath37 , and to describe the whole regime of energies below @xmath38 .",
    "such an achievement was made possible by exploiting the bethe - ansatz exact solutions of fendley _",
    "et  al._@xcite for the impurity problem in a tll . within the bethe - ansatz solution ,",
    "the fcs can be computed exactly as well .",
    "in particular , using these results for the current and noise , it was possible to derive a crucial and exact relation between the derivative of the differential conductance @xmath39 and the differential zf noise @xmath40 at zero temperature : @xmath41 let us remark that in the limit of small @xmath8 , eq .",

    "they have confirmed the results presented above ( of ref .  ) in the perturbative regime they restrict to ( with respect to @xmath37 ) , which corresponds to high energies in the wbs domain.@xcite even more , when treating many channels in a mean - field approach , the agreement holds too , provided the tll s parameter in eq .",
