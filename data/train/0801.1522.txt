    "however , the whole arguments remain valid for the general case .",
    "note that , even though the feedback stabilization of a quantum system necessitates more complicated models taking into account the measurement backaction on the system ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the kind of strategy considered in this paper can be helpful for the open - loop control of closed quantum systems .",
    "indeed , one can apply the stabilization techniques for the schrdinger equation in simulation and retrieve the control signal that will be then applied in open - loop on the real physical system . as it will be detailed below , in the bibliographic overview ,",
    "such kind of strategy has been widely used in the context of finite dimensional quantum systems .    the main result of this article is the following one .    [ stab - hs - sigma ]",

    "we will see that the assumption @xmath72 , for some @xmath39is not necessary for doing that .",

    "notice that , physically , the assumption @xmath77 is not really restrictive . indeed , if @xmath78 , a control field in resonance with the natural frequencies of the system ( the difference between the eigenvalues corresponding to an eigenstate whose population in the initial state is non - zero and the ground state ) will , instantaneously , ensure a non - zero population of the ground state in the wavefunction .",
    "then , one can just apply the feedback law of the theorem  [ stab - hs - sigma ] .",
    "the controllability of a finite dimensional quantum system , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are @xmath83 hermitian matrices with coefficients in @xmath84 has been very well explored  @xcite . however",
    ", this does not guarantee the simplicity of the trajectory generation .",
    "very often the chemists formulate the task of the open - loop control as a cost functional to be minimized .",
    "optimal control techniques ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) and iterative stochastic techniques ( e.g , genetic algorithms  @xcite ) are then two classes of approaches which are most commonly used for this task .",
    "when some non - degeneracy assumptions concerning the linearized system are satisfied ,  @xcite provides another method based on lyapunov techniques for generating trajectories .",
    "the relevance of such a method for the control of chemical models has been studied in  @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "the closed - loop system is simulated and the retrieved control signal is applied in open - loop .",
    "such kind of strategy has already been applied widely in this framework  @xcite .",
    "the situation is much more difficult when we consider an infinite dimensional configuration and less results are available .",
    "however , the controllability of the system ( [ eq : main])-([eq : initial])-([eq : bords ] ) is now well understood . in  @xcite",
    ", the author states some non - controllability results for general schrdinger systems .",
    "these results apply in particular to the system ( [ eq : main])-([eq : initial])-([eq : bords ] ) . however , this negative result is due to the choice of the functional space that does not allow the controllability . indeed ,",
    "if we consider different functional spaces , one can get positive controllability results . in  @xcite , the local controllability of the system ( [ eq : main])-([eq : initial])-([eq : bords ] ) around the ground state @xmath58 , for",
    "@xmath85 small is proved .",
    "the case @xmath69 is easier because the linearized system around @xmath58 for @xmath69 small is controllable ; this case is treated with the moment theory and a nash - moser implicit functions theorem . as it has been discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the case of @xmath86 is degenerate : the linearized system around @xmath87 is not controllable .",
    "therefore , in this case , one needs to apply other tools , namely the return method ( introduced in  @xcite ) and the quantum adiabatic theory  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the steady - state controllability of this nonlinear system is proved ( i.e. the particle can be moved in finite time from an eigenstate @xmath46 to another one @xmath88 ) .",
    "the proof relies on many local controllability results ( proved with the previous strategies ) together with a compactness argument .    concerning the trajectory generation problem for infinite dimensional systems still much less results are available .",
    "the very few existing literature is mostly based on the use of the optimal control techniques  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the feedback law found by the lyapunov techniques in  @xcite suggests the use of the same approach for infinite dimensional configurations . however , an extension of the convergence analysis to the pde configuration is not at all a trivial problem .",
    "indeed , it requires the pre - compactness of the closed - loop trajectories , a property that is difficult to prove in infinite dimension .",
    "this strategy is used , for exemple in @xcite .    in  @xcite ,",
    "one of the authors proposes a lyapunov - based method to approximately stabilize a particle in a 3d finite potential well under some restrictive assumptions .",
    "the author assumes that the system is initialized in the finite dimensional discrete part of the spectrum .",
    "then , the idea consists in proposing a lyapunov function which encodes both the distance with respect to the target state and the necessity of remaining in the discrete part of the spectrum . in this way",
    ", he prevents the possibility of the `` mass lost phenomenon '' at infinity .",
    "finally , applying some dispersive estimates of strichartz type , he ensures the approximate stabilization of an arbitrary eigenstate in the discrete part of the spectrum .",
    "finally , let us mention other strategies for proving the stabilization of control systems .",
    "one can try to build a feedback law for which one has a strict lyapunov function .",
    "this strategy is used , for example , for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in @xcite , for the 2-d incompressible euler equation in a simply connected domain in @xcite , see also @xcite for the multiconnected case . for systems having a non controllable linearized system around the equilibrium considered ,",
    "the return method often provides good results , see for example @xcite for controllable systems without drift and @xcite ) for camassa - holm equation . in the end , we refer to @xcite for a pedagogical presentation of strategies for the proof of stabilization of pde control systems .",
    "+ in this paper , we study the stabilization of the ground state @xmath58 for @xmath85 in a neighborhood of @xmath89 . adapting the techniques proposed in  @xcite",
    ", we ensure the approximate stabilization of the system around @xmath58 .",
    "note that , the whole arguments hold if we replace the target state by any eigenstate @xmath53 of the system .      while trying to stabilize the ground state @xmath58 , a first approach would be to consider the simple lyapunov function @xmath90 just as in the finite the dimensional case  @xcite , the feedback law @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the imaginary part of a complex , ensures the decrease of the lyapunov function .",
    "however , trying to adapt the convergence analysis , based on the use of the lasalle invariance principle , the pre - compactness of the trajectories in @xmath93 constitutes a major obstacle .",
    "note that , in order to be able to apply the lasalle principle for an infinite dimensional system , one certainly needs to prove such a pre - compactness result . in the particular case of the infinite potential",
    "well , it even seems that , one can not hope such a result .",
    "indeed , phenomenons such as the @xmath93-mass lost in the high energy levels do not allow this property to hold true .",
    "similarly to  @xcite , the approach of this paper is to avoid the population to go through the very high energy levels , while trying to stabilize the system around @xmath58 .",
    "as in theorem  [ stab - hs - sigma ] , let us consider @xmath59 , @xmath94 , @xmath60,@xmath95 , @xmath33 .",
    "first , we consider the case , @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath96 with @xmath97 , large enough , so that @xmath98 then , we consider the lyapunov function @xmath99 note that , this lyapunov function depends on the constants @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 through the choice of the cut - off dimension , @xmath104 .",
    "just like  @xcite , it encodes two tasks : 1- it prevents the @xmath93-mass lost through the high - energy eigenstates ; 2- it privileges the increase of the population in the first eigenstate .",
    "when @xmath27 solves @xmath9 with some control @xmath105 , we have @xmath106 where @xmath107    thus , the feedback law @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a positive constant , trivially ensures the decrease of the lyapunov function  .",
    "we claim that , the solution of ( [ eq : main])-([eq : initial])-([eq : bords ] ) with initial condition @xmath75 and control @xmath110 satisfies @xmath111 note that , the claimed result here is much stronger than the one provided in  @xcite for the finite potential well problem .",
    "in fact , here , we claim the almost global approximate stabilization of the system round the eigenstate @xmath58 .    the limit   will be proved by studying the @xmath28-weak limits of @xmath112 when @xmath113 .",
    "namely , let @xmath114 be an increasing sequence of positive real numbers such that @xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath116 , there exists @xmath117 such that , up to a subsequence , @xmath118 weakly in @xmath28 . using the controllability of the linearized system around @xmath58 ( which is equivalent to @xmath119 for every @xmath120 ) , we will be able to prove that @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "this will imply  .",
    "therefore , by weakening the stabilization property ( i.e. ask approximate stabilization instead of stabilization ) we avoid the compactness problem evoked at the begining of this section .    note",
    "that , the controllability of the linearized system around the trajectory @xmath58 plays a crucial role here .",
    "this is why the developed techniques for @xmath69 can not be applied , directly , to the case of @xmath86 .",
    "+ now , let us study the case @xmath86 .",
    "as emphasized above , the previous strategy does not work for the approximate stabilization of @xmath124 because the linearized system around @xmath124 is not controllable .",
    "the idea is thus to use the above feedback design   with a dynamic @xmath125 that converges to zero as @xmath126 .",
    "formally , the convergence of @xmath27 toward @xmath127 must happen at a faster rate than that of @xmath85 toward zero ( see figure  [ figaux ] ) .",
    "in this aim , we consider the lyapunov function @xmath128 is implicitly defined as below @xmath129 for a slowly varying real function @xmath130 .",
    "we claim that such a function @xmath131 exists .",
    "when @xmath27 solves @xmath9 , we have @xmath132 where @xmath133 denotes the real part of a complex number , @xmath134 is defined by ( [ def - a ] ) and the notation @xmath135 means the derivative of the map @xmath136 taken at the point @xmath137 . by definition of @xmath131 , we have @xmath138 thus , the feedback law @xmath139 where @xmath140 with @xmath109 , ensures @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a positive constant , when @xmath143 is small enough . thus @xmath144 is not increasing .",
    "we claim that , the solution of ( [ eq : main])-([eq : initial])-([eq : bords ] ) with initial condition @xmath75 and control @xmath145 satisfies @xmath146 again , this will be proved by studying the @xmath28-weak limits of @xmath112 when @xmath126 .",
