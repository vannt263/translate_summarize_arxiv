    "crystal growth from an under - cooled fluid phase is frequently described by a diffusion equation for heat or particle density , complemented by boundary conditions at a moving sharp interface between the solid and fluid phases .",
    "as explained in the review @xcite by langer , one of the boundary conditions comprises the conservation of the density field in terms of the related flux and source terms at the interface .",
    "a second boundary condition is the gibbs - thomson relation which is adequate in cases of local thermodynamic equilibrium . for applications in the rapid - growth regime aziz and boettinger @xcite",
    "have extended the gibbs - thomson relation by including non - equilibrium effects which they derived in an intermediate step from an atomistic picture of the initially extended interface region .",
    "one of the most exciting achievements of the sharp - interface approach is the explanation of dendritic growth in the diffusion - limited regime , opening up at low under - cooling .",
    "the initiation of this process is described by the mullins - sekerka instability @xcite whereas the cumbersome route to an analytic calculation of the fully - developed three - dimensional dendrite by brener @xcite is reviewed in ref .",
    "another exciting case of pattern formation in the kinetics - limited rapid - growth regime is the periodic formation of layers with alternating homogeneous and dendritic micro - structures in dilute binary alloys @xcite .",
    "a crucial point in explanations of this effect by carrard et al .",
    "@xcite , and by karma and sarkissian @xcite is the non - monotonous dependence of the interface temperature on the growth velocity , observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a fundamentally different access to a theory of crystal growth rests on the use of a phase - field order parameter which allows a continuous transition between the solid and fluid phases .",
    "this approach is closely related to that , used by halperin , hohenberg , and ma @xcite for studying dynamic critical behavior in their model c , and , in the context of crystal - growth processes , has been described by collins and levine @xcite , by caginalp and fife @xcite , and by langer @xcite .",
    "phase - field models for binary alloys have been established by wheeler et al .",
    "@xcite , and later by kim et al .",
    "@xcite . in the article @xcite by langer it is emphasized that one reason for promoting the phase - field approach is the hope , that similar to the identification of universality classes for dynamic critical phenomena , one may obtain a fundamental understanding of various pattern - forming mechanisms in solidification problems .",
    "a quite different reason for the interest in the phase - field approach is that it presents a convenient basis for simulations , avoiding the costly interface - tracking procedure , necessary in the sharp - interface description .    within a phase - field approach lwen et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the long - time crossover behavior between the diffusion- and the kinetics - limited regime .",
    "one of their results is the appearance of meta - stable branches where the steady - state motion of a planar solidification front can occur in the diffusion - limited regime .",
    "these branches are part of the trajectories which show the non - monotonous dependence of the interface temperature on velocity , later found in ref . @xcite . in a phase - field model of rapid solidification ahmad et al .",
    "@xcite have considered the effects of solute trapping and solute drag , and found partial agreements with the results , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . a good example for",
    "the computational use of the phase - field approach is the work of karma and rapell @xcite on a quantitative description of dendritic growth . in their treatment",
    "the above - mentioned non - monotonic velocity dependence of the interface temperature is noticed by the appearance of a negative kinetic coefficient , joining the term , linear in velocity .",
    "since such an anomaly does not arise in the sharp - interface description of dendritic growth , the authors invented a compensation device for the unwanted term .    among the numerous papers on derivations of sharp - interface descriptions from a phase - field model",
    "the work by elder et al .",
    "@xcite is probably the most elaborate one .",
    "their approach avoids the assumption of a zero interface width , but instead uses the products of this width with the interface curvature , and with the growth rate divided by the diffusion constant , as small expansion parameters . since , however , the second parameter is of order one in the rapid - growth regime , applications to this regime are excluded .",
    "the result for the gibbs - thomson relation in the low - velocity regime contains a kinetic - under - cooling term where , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the kinetic coefficient can , in some parameter range , become negative , an effect which regrettably has not been scrutinized by the authors .    in the present paper we advertise a model description where , retaining a finite interface width , the interface position is used as basic field variable , in addition to a bulk - diffusion field .",
    "although the energy density is a feasible example of a bulk field , we will predominantly consider the isothermal solidification of a dilute binary alloy , in which this role is taken by the concentration of the solute component .",
    "an advantage of our approach is that it remains valid in the rapid - growth regime which can be seen in a thorough derivation from a phase - field model .",
    "our description can , however , also be derived in a self - contained way from first principles , in the first line from the observation that the presence of an interface breaks euclidean symmetry , and , therefore , implies the existence of goldstone modes @xcite .",
    "these are capillary waves of the solidification front which interact with the bulk - diffusion mode .",
    "the interaction kernel as well as the diffusion coefficient can be freely chosen in our approach which , therefore , can be applied to a sizable variety of model systems .    for a subset of models with a location - independent diffusion constant",
    ", we have derived a universal form of the dispersion relation of interface eigenmodes .",
    "these modes determine all possible morphological instabilities of the solidification front , and in all cases we encounter the mullins - sekerka instability .",
    "it is the only instability which survives the sharp - interface limit in our scheme .",
    "as soon as we allow a finite interface width , we become aware of an additional instability which features a finite amplification rate already for a planar perturbation , a behavior , previously discovered by cahn @xcite in grain - boundary motion . the nature of this instability is closely related to the non - monotonic velocity dependence of the interface temperature . in our approach",
    "the shift of this temperature from the melting point of the solvent enters as a driving force which we also evaluated analytically for several models .",
    "although these subjects are , like the distantly - related corriel - sekerka instability @xcite , mostly discussed in connection with the rapid - growth regime , they also affect the low - velocity behavior , as illustrated by the previously mentioned sign problem of the kinetic coefficient .",
    "one of the toy models , investigated in the frame of our capillary - wave approach , allows a surprisingly simple analysis of some attributes of the solidification process . in this model",
    "both input - functions , the solute - interface interaction and the solute - diffusion coefficient , are taken to linearly interpolate between the solid and fluid bulk phases , assuming a finite interface width .",
    "the effect of solute trapping is measured by the partition coefficient , for which we found an expression , coinciding with that , derived by aziz and kaplan @xcite , up to some re - scaling of the involved characteristic velocity .",
    "we , furthermore , have established a simple analytic relation between the driving force and the growth rate which reflects the non - monotonous behavior of the interface temperature .",
    "the minima of all driving - force trajectories are connected by a kinetic spinodal line which we also have determined analytically , finding agreement with an analogous line in the non - isothermal growth of a one - component crystal , discussed by umantsev @xcite .",
    "the image of this spinodal line in the temperature - concentration phase diagram is located between the solidus line and a static spinodal line , established by baker and cahn @xcite . within our model",
    "this provides an answer to an issue concerning this matter , discussed by hillert in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our concluding discussion we present an expression for the entropy production in the steady - state growth of a planar solidification front .",
    "the result demonstrates that the appearance of a negative kinetic coefficient , also in our approach , is not in conflict with basic principles of linear irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "also included in our discussion are some estimates for the relevant model parameters which determine the range of validity of our approach .",
    "we , finally , emphasize the flexibility of our description , concerning generalizations and the inclusion of additional field variables .",
    "in order to derive our capillary - wave model from a standard phase - field model , we initially describe the isothermal solidification of a dilute binary alloy by a phase field @xmath0 for the solvent , and a concentration field @xmath1 of the solute component . in terms of these field variables",

    "( [ g - properties ] ) the quantity ( [ s - prod ] ) again is positive which remains true in the expanded form        to complete our presentation , we add a few estimates which border the range of applicability of our approach .",
    "first of all , it is clear that the two small parameters @xmath57 and @xmath170 of our approach can be tuned by the miscibility gap @xmath33 and by the driving force @xmath71 , respectively . from eqs .",
    "( [ kappa(t ) ] ) and ( [ dimensionless ] ) we know that      according to turnbull @xcite there is a correlation between the surface tension and the latent heat of the form @xmath357 where @xmath358 measures the average atomic distance , and , for essentially all metals , @xmath359 . assuming @xmath360 , and expressing the miscibility gap by the temperature gap          for the values @xmath363 and @xmath364 this yields @xmath365 which is sufficiently small , and identical to the value , underlying figs . 9 and 10 .",
    "the value @xmath180 , also used in these figures , has been adopted from ref .",
    "@xcite , and , in the rapid growth regime @xmath366 implies @xmath367 for our second expansion parameter .    as a final remark",
    "we point out that the capillary - wave model , defined by eqs .",
    "( [ i - hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ i - dynamics ] ) , is amenable to a variety of generalizations without going back to a phase - field description .",
    "one generalization in the surface part of the effective hamiltonian ( [ i - hamiltonian ] ) is the replacement of the integral expression by the exact area of the interface which in the equation of motion leads to the appearance of the full mean curvature .",
    "simultaneously , one may also incorporate an anisotropy of the surface tension .",
    "further generalizations are the inclusion of the energy density or other bulk fields which then generates a number of cross couplings in the hamiltonian .",
    "parallel to this , eqs .",
    "( [ i - dynamics ] ) will be replaced by an enlarged set of equations of motion which in general is equipped with a matrix of onsager coefficients .",
    "a consistent discussion of the directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy requires a coupling of the energy density to the interface position which we will consider in a forthcoming paper .",
