    "over the past decades , the numerical resolution of maxwell equations has made outstanding advances , thanks to the various rigourous methods developed to solve them .",
    "one may think for instance , in the theory of gratings , of the integral method , the differential method or the method of fictitious sources .",
    "the tremendous progress of computer capacities has been equally important .",
    "generally speaking , it seems that we now have very efficient tools to solve any diffraction problem ( the 3d is merely a problem of computer power , and not a theoretical one ) . nevertheless , quoting r. thom , the famous mathematician , field medalist and inventor of catastrophe theory ,  predicting is not explaining  . and",
    "although we are able to compute almost everything , we can not explain much .",
    "this paper points out that a simple problem , here a one dimensional one , may lead to deep questions and somewhat interesting answers .",
    "our starting point is a basic remark concerning diopters .",
    "the diffraction of a plane wave , in normal incidence , by a diopter separating the vacuum from a homogeneous medium of optical index @xmath0 gives rise to fresnel coefficients as is well known .",
    "@xmath1    this is indeed a fundamental result , commonly used by the opticists .",
    "unfortunately diopters do not exist and , consequently , the famous fresnel coefficients should not exist either .",
    "the problem may be formulated in the following way : let us consider a slab of index @xmath0 and width @xmath2 .",
    "this gives rise to a reflection coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "a natural question is : do we get @xmath4 when letting @xmath2 tend to infinity in @xmath3 ?",
    "when we consider a lossless material ( @xmath0 is therefore real ) , the answer is no , obviously .",
    "so , how can one measure fresnel coefficients as there is no such thing as a semi - infinite medium in practice ? two kinds of answers are generally put forward . the first answer that seems to come naturally to",
    "many is to evoke the absorption , and the fact that transparent media do not exist .",
    "let us say that it is a poor answer .",
    "indeed , consider for instance the diffraction of a beam , in optical range , by a homogeneous layer ( for example , silice for which the refractive index is @xmath5 ) , let s say of a few millimeters ( namely the substrate ) .",
    "we can hardly say that there is any absorption in that case .",
    "but we have here a medium that is almost thousand wavelengths wide .",
    "another way out generally put forward is to evoque coherence length .",
    "this argument is probably correct for the natural light for which coherence length is about micrometer , i.e. less than the depth of materials commonly used in optics ( see @xcite for an exhaustive review on this subject ) .",
    "however for a beam whose coherence length is greater than a few millimeters one has to find another explanation ( it is the case for he - ne laser beam , for which coherence length is about 20 cm ) . without using the two above quoted arguments , we propose a rigorous answer to this problem , in the more general case of a semi - infinite periodic medium .",
    "more precisely , we show that it is possible to define the field reflected by a semi - infinite periodic medium .",
    "we demonstrate that there is no need to use the so - called limiting absorption principle nor to use explicitly the notion of coherence length .",
    "we proceed in two stages .",
    "first , we study the diffraction of a plane wave by a finite medium . in this case",
    ", the diffracted field is characterized by a reflection coefficient . in a second stage ,",
    "we study the limit behavior of the reflection coefficient as the width of the medium tends to infinity .",
    "all the fields that we consider are @xmath6-independent and therefore we may reduce the diffraction problem to the basic cases of polarization : e// ( electric field parallel to @xmath7 and h// ( magnetic field parallel to @xmath6 ) .",
    "we consider a one dimensional structure made of @xmath8 identical layers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a layer is characterized by its relative permittivity @xmath9 , which is assumed to be real and positive . for convenience up to the section 4",
    "included , the thickness of a layer is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the structure is illuminated by a wavepacket of the following form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is some measure over the set @xmath13 of parameters @xmath14 : @xmath15",
    "-% \\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right [ } \\right\\ } \\ ; .\\ ] ]    explicit forms of @xmath12 will be given in section 4 . by means of fourier analysis",
    ", the diffraction of such a wavepacket by a finite structure may be reduced to the study of the diffraction of a plane wave , which we develop in the following paragraph .",
    "we consider a plane wave of wave vector @xmath16 illuminating the structure under the incidence @xmath17 ( @xmath16 is assumed to belong to the @xmath18 plane , we denote @xmath19 ) .",
    "the total field is described by a single variable function @xmath20 .",
    "when the electric field is parallel to the z - axis ( e// case ) @xmath21 represents the @xmath6-component of the electric field and when the magnetic field is parallel to the z - axis ( h// case ) , it represents the z - component of magnetic field . denoting : @xmath22 ^{1/2},$ ] the total field @xmath23 verifies the following equation :    @xmath24    and the radiation conditions lead to the following equations    @xmath25    with : @xmath26 for e// polarization , @xmath27 for h// polarization .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be the solutions of equation ( [ problem ] )  verifying    @xmath30 the fundamental matrix of the system is then    @xmath31 and the resolvent matrix is :    @xmath32 it is the matrix linking the value of one solution at point @xmath33 to its value at point @xmath34 .",
    "the monodromy matrix is finally defined as : @xmath35 this matrix characterizes a layer as it allows the writing of the matching between the boundary conditions . indeed , taking into account the propagation conditions ( [ propag ] )",
    ", we derive the following relation :    @xmath36    which permits to obtain both values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "when dealing with a wavepacket , we write the reflected field under the form :    @xmath39    * our aim is now to study the limit behavior of * @xmath37 *  as * @xmath8 *  tends to infinity . *",
    "the determinant of matrix @xmath40 is the value of the wronskian of solutions @xmath41 and @xmath42 at point @xmath10 . as in that case",
    "the wronskian is constant , it is equal to @xmath10 . consequently , @xmath40 is a unimodular matrix and its characteristic polynomial is @xmath43",
    ". therefore the eigenvalues of @xmath40 are real if and only if @xmath44 .",
    "this suggests a splitting of the set of parameters :    @xmath45    when @xmath46 , the eigenvalues of @xmath47 are conjugate complex numbers of modulus @xmath10 , whereas when @xmath48 * , * @xmath40 has two real eigenvalues @xmath49 where , by convention , @xmath50 . if @xmath51 , then @xmath40 has an eigenvalue @xmath52 of multiplicity @xmath53 with either @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "we denote by @xmath56 the subset of @xmath57 where @xmath47 or @xmath58 is the identity matrix .",
    "bloch wave theory is the convenient tool when dealing with propagation equations with periodic coefficients .",
    "given a periodic medium with period @xmath59 , it consists in searching solutions of schrdinger or wave equation under the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a @xmath59-periodic function and @xmath62 belongs to the so - called first brillouin zone @xmath63 .",
    "for one - dimensional media , with period @xmath64 , the theory is quite simple , for in that case @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , bloch solutions write @xmath66 , where the so - called bloch frequency @xmath67 belongs to @xmath63 , and @xmath68 .",
    "thus we have @xmath69 . from the definition of @xmath40",
    "this means that @xmath70 is an eigenvalue of @xmath40 , and the above remarks shows that @xmath71 , which provides us with the dispersion relation of the medium and leads us to define @xmath67 a function on @xmath72 by : @xmath73 obviously , for couples @xmath74 belonging to @xmath72 , it is possible to define a bloch frequency @xmath67 , and therefore there exists propagating waves in the medium : such couples @xmath74 thus define a conduction band .",
    "if @xmath74 belongs to @xmath75 then there are only evanescent waves and @xmath74 belongs to a forbidden band .",
    "we suppose that @xmath74 belongs to @xmath76 . denoting @xmath77 a basis of eigenvectors of @xmath40 we write in the canonical basis of @xmath78  : @xmath79 eigenvector @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 ) is associated to eigenvalue @xmath82 ( resp .",
    "@xmath83 ) .",
    "it is of course always possible to choose @xmath77 such that @xmath84 .",
    "after tedious but easy calculations , we get @xmath37 in closed form from ( [ raccord ] ) : @xmath85 denoting @xmath86  , functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 are defined by @xmath89 we have @xmath90 and in a conduction band @xmath91 so that we always have @xmath92 .",
    "let us denote finally denote : @xmath93 we immediately see that the reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained through @xmath94 and @xmath95 by : @xmath96",
    "the reflection coefficient defines a sequence of points belonging to the closed unit disc @xmath97 of the complex plane . in order to have a clear understanding of the behavior of @xmath98",
    ", we interpret this sequence as a discrete dynamical system . as @xmath8 increases ,",
    "we want to study how the orbits of this system spread over @xmath97 .",
    "when @xmath74 belongs to @xmath99 the behavior of the dynamical system is trivial as @xmath98 admits one cluster point , situated on @xmath100 .",
    "indeed , in that case @xmath101 belongs to @xmath102 . recalling that by convention @xmath103 , we see that @xmath104 tends to @xmath105 .",
    "as the eigenvectors of @xmath106 are real , we conclude that @xmath105 belongs to @xmath107 .",
    "the second easy case is for @xmath74 belonging to @xmath56 , indeed @xmath98 is constant and equal to @xmath108 whatever @xmath8 .",
    "these two cases hand the gaps as well as the edges of the gaps .",
    "the case of the conduction bands , i.e. for @xmath74 belonging to @xmath109 is much more complicated and interesting . in the following",
    "we will skip the mathematical rigor and stress on the physical meaning of the results . the interested reader will find a complete and rigorous mathematical discussion in @xcite .",
    "dealing with a couple @xmath74 belonging to @xmath72 , the eigenvalues of @xmath40 now belong to @xmath110 and we may write @xmath111 .",
    "obviously , @xmath112 has no pointwise limit as @xmath8 tends to infinity . from a geometrical point of view , it is easy to show that the image of @xmath110 through @xmath113 is a circle @xmath114 passing through the origin and whose cartesian equation writes :    @xmath115    therefore , @xmath98 describes a set of point on @xmath116 .",
    "as @xmath98 does not converge pointwise , we turn to another notion of convergence , in some average meaning . an easy computation in the case @xmath117 ,",

    "what we expect is some averaging over the set @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , the limit behavior relies on the properties of @xmath12 and @xmath67 .",
    "let us define a convenient class of measures . denoting @xmath126 the space of continuous @xmath63-periodic functions",
    ", we put :    * definition 2 * : _ a measure _ @xmath12 _  is said admissible , if _ @xmath127",
    "_  tends weakly to _ @xmath128 .",
    "of course , this looks like an _ ad hoc _ property as it allows to get directly the limits of interest , but indeed this is a correct way of handling the problem , as it can be shown that the measures of interest for our problem , i.e. that of physical significance , will prove to be admissible . from the above expression",

    "now , let us choose the incident field as a wavepacket of the form ( [ incident ] ) where @xmath131 is of one of the following forms :    @xmath132 -% \\frac{\\pi } { 2},+\\frac{\\pi } { 2}\\right [ , d\\theta ) \\\\",

    "indeed measures of type @xmath133 correspond to a general wavepacket , measures of type @xmath134 to a monochromatic beam , and measures of type @xmath135 to a temporal pulse . in order to apply the above results we have the following fundamental result :    * proposition 2 * : _ measures of type _",
    "@xmath136 _",
    "are admissible .",
    "_    we can conclude that , for these measures @xmath137 the diffracted field @xmath138 corresponding to @xmath8 layers converges uniformly towards @xmath139 given by :    @xmath140    that way , we have obtained a rigorous formulation for the diffraction of a wavepacket by a semi - infinite medium .",
    "a very special and interesting case is the case of a simple slab of optical index @xmath0 : the reflection coefficient ( @xmath3 ) is therefore well known : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the reflection coefficient for the diopter ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "when the slab is filled with a lossy material @xmath8 is therefore element of @xmath144 , and in that case : @xmath145 on the contrary , when we are dealing with lossless materials , @xmath0 is real . in that case",
    ", @xmath3 has an oscillating behavior and does not converge ( and _ a fortiori _ does not converge to @xmath142 ) .",

    "we are therefore in the case where the measure @xmath149 is of the form @xmath134 ( cf .",
    "paragraph v ) i.e. : @xmath150 with @xmath151-\\pi",
    "/2,\\pi /2[,d\\theta ) $ ] . in these conditions",
    "the diffracted ( reflected ) field @xmath152 corresponding to a slab of finite thickness @xmath2 follows as such : @xmath153 and the diffracted field @xmath154 corresponding to the diopter : @xmath155 and we have the fundamental result : @xmath156 it is very easy to calculate the reflection coefficient @xmath157 in that case .",
    "the monodromy matrix is : @xmath158 so that @xmath159 therefore every @xmath14 belongs to @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "after elementary calculations we find : @xmath162 taking everything into account , we find the weak convergence @xmath163 and therefore @xmath164 .",
    "in numerous experiments in optics it appears that the light concentrates round particular areas of the overall space , namely the rays . in this paragraph",
    ", we establish a link between the amplitude associated with a ray and the amplitude associated with the electric field .",
    "it is well known that many reflected rays appear when dealing with the reflection coefficient of a monochromatic beam by a `` simple '' perot - fabry , we are in the same case as in the precedent paragraph , for wich the reflected field corresponding to the finite thickness slab @xmath152writes as follows : @xmath165 > from equation ( [ reflection ] ) , the reflection coefficient @xmath3can be expressed as a series in the following manner :    @xmath166    consequently , @xmath167can also be expressed as a series ( the exponential decreasing of @xmath142 allows us to reverse the signs @xmath168and @xmath169 ) :    @xmath170    with    @xmath171    finally , introducing the two transmission coefficients @xmath172 and @xmath173 , we find an expression of @xmath174 that the opticist can interpret at first glance :    @xmath175    each function @xmath174 , @xmath176 is interpreted as the complex amplitude associated with a ray labeled by @xmath177 ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) :    * the term @xmath178 corresponds to the amplitude associated with a ray @xmath177 . *",
    "the term @xmath179 corresponds to a term of phase which expresses the delay of the reflected ray @xmath177 with respect to the first reflected ray ( @xmath180 ) * the minus sign before the integral may appear as suspicious .",
    "however , for the opticist , the interpretation of this sign is easy .",
    "the reflection of all rays are of the same nature ( reflection of a ray from a medium of index @xmath181 on a medium of index @xmath10 ) except for the first ray ( reflection of a ray from a medium of index @xmath10 on a medium of index @xmath0 ) , which implies a change of sign in the reflection coefficient .    besides , expression ( [ uhser ] ) calls for two remarks :    1 .",
    "the optical interpretation of functions @xmath174 is all the more clear as the following conditions are better fulfilled : a ) the supports of the rays @xmath177 are actually separated , i.e. the function @xmath182 has a narrow support , b ) the incident field is sufficiently slanted and c ) the depth of the slab is sufficiently large with respect to the wavelength .",
    "2 .   in the precedent paragraph",
    ", we have shown that @xmath167 tends to @xmath183 as @xmath2 tends to infinity , consequently the series in equation ( [ uhser ] ) has to tend to zero when @xmath2 tends to infinity .",
    "therefore , each function @xmath174 behaves as a corrector for the diffracted field ( each ray except the first one does vanish when the depth of the slab tends to infinity ) .",
    "we consider now a one dimensional structure made of @xmath8 identical layers .",
    "writing @xmath184 the field diffracted by this structure , we have :    @xmath185    using the expression of @xmath37 in ( [ reflect ] ) and the same techniques used above , we find :    @xmath186    with    @xmath187    and    @xmath188 p(\\alpha ) e^{i(-\\alpha x+\\beta ( \\alpha ) y)}\\,d\\alpha\\ ] ]    the same comments as in the preceding section can be made .      up to",
    "now a special attention has been drawn about theoretical aspects of electromagnetic diffraction .",
    "more precisely , we have proved that , in any case encountered in physics , the function @xmath189 which represents the diffracted field converges to a function @xmath190 which one can easily calculate .",
    "but it remains to be seen how the function @xmath191 converges to its limit .",
    "for instance , in harmonic regime with a pulsatance @xmath192 , it is of practical prime importance to know the number of layers @xmath193 from which one can replace , with a given precision @xmath194 , @xmath195 by @xmath196 . from a theoretical point of view , it is very difficult to answer such questions even if , in some respects , we outlined an answer in the precedent paragraph .",
    "we are thus `` doomed '' to make numerical experiments and to leave the general insights of the theory . of course , in this paragraph",
    ", we do not aspire to the exhaustiveness and we only aim at giving some rough estimates .",
    "in what follows , we are only dealing with a single perot - fabry made of silice for which the refractive index is @xmath197 illuminated by a monochromatic gaussian beam solely characterized by the wavelength ( @xmath198 ) , the size @xmath199 and the height @xmath200 of the waist and the mean incidence angle @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for such a beam the function @xmath201 introduced above writes as follows :    @xmath202    where @xmath203 and @xmath204 . in our numerical experiments , we have taken the following values : @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 , where @xmath113 is the `` height of observation '' ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) . for these values , we have drawn , in the same figure @xmath208 , @xmath209and @xmath210as functions of @xmath34 ( shifted of @xmath211 ) for the following normalized depths ( @xmath212 ) and for two normalized waists ( @xmath213 ) ( cf .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] to [ fig7 ] for a waist of @xmath214 , and figures @xmath215 to @xmath216 for a waist of @xmath217 ) .",
    "geometrical optics predicts the following locations of the maxima ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ) :       [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we have drawn in figure [ fig13 ] ( resp .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) the total field map @xmath218 for @xmath219 ( resp .",
    "for@xmath220 ) and for depth @xmath221 .    in this example",
    ", we see that a width of about 1000 wavelengths ( for @xmath222 this means a @xmath223 width for the substrate ) is necessary to obtain the rays described in classical optics . in practical experiments ,",
    "the width of the substrate is usually of the order of one millimeter or more , and therefore the fresnel coefficients are indeed measured .",
    "what is classical optics ( or coherent optics ) ?",
    "since maxwell , at the end of the nineteenth century , the answer seems to be easy : classical optics is the study of the diffraction of an electromagnetic field by a body whose size is very large compared with the wavelength ( mean wavelength ) .",
    "that means that we have to consider classical optics as a limit for small wavelengths of electromagnetic optics . unlike the _ doxa ,",
    "_ we consider that this limit is far from being clear .",
    "for instance , it is well known that in electromagnetic optics , the diffracted field is very sensitive to the polarization of the incident field . on the contrary , for small wavelengths , in a lot of applications ,",
    "the diffracted field is independent of the polarization . in many cases ,",
    "this remarkable property remains mysterious . in this paper , we only dealt with one dimensional problem and we demonstrated that the limit analysis ( the path from the electromagnetic problem to the optical one ) is generally ill posed for a plane wave ( fortunately , this case does not exist ! ) but is well posed for the cases encountered in physics . besides , the limit analysis that we have given above does not take into account the roughness of the layers .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we did not think fit to describe in a realistic way the process of measuring the field : this would have lead us to use a spatial convolution process .",
    "these remarks are not at all limitations of our study . on the contrary , both these phenomena would have improved the convergence of the involved sequences .",
    "nevertheless we do think that this limit analysis is far more fundamental for a good understanding of classical optics than the usual explanations.take the case of spectacles , which are usually intended to improve the vision .",
    "can one be satisfied by such an explanation as that involving absorption ?",
    "the challenge is now to extend these results to the bidimensional or even tridimensional case , for which the very mathematical formulation itself is far from being clear .",
