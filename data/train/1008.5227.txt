    "suppose @xmath1 is a density on a state - space @xmath2 with respect to some dominating measure @xmath3 . most often the state - space is a subset of the euclidean space and @xmath3 is the lebesgue measure .",
    "in this article we will always assume @xmath3 to be the lebesgue measure .",
    "statisticians main aim is to study the characteristics of the density @xmath1 .",
    "sometimes ( say , in bayesian inference ) @xmath1 may be a complicated ( possibly unnormalized ) density which is not analytically tractable .",
    "so , to study the characteristics of @xmath1 , statisticians try to draw a sample from @xmath1 .",
    "but then also there may not exist any effective simulation procedure to simulate from @xmath1 .",
    "thus the goal is shifted to draw an approximate sample from @xmath1 .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) provides a method for doing this .",
    "the mcmc methods , quite famous for their effectiveness in drawing an approximate sample from a target density are widely used .",
    "one of the most famous mcmc algorithms is the metropolis - hastings ( mh ) algorithm @xcite . given a current state @xmath4 the mh algorithm proposes a new state @xmath5 from a _ proposal kernel density _",
    "@xmath6 on @xmath2 , and accepts it with the acceptance probability @xmath7 the corresponding mh kernel has stationary distribution @xmath8 .",
    "the random walk mh ( rwmh ) has the proposal kernel @xmath9 .",
    "we notice that generation a point from such a density is same as generating an @xmath10 from @xmath11 and then setting @xmath12 .",
    "other algorithms like langevin mh ( lmh ) , has proposal kernel @xmath13    all of the aforementioned algorithms have certain disadvantages .",
    "for example , both the rwmh and lmh have slow mixing rates in certain cases .",
    "the acceptance rate for rwmh is high if @xmath14 is concentrated around zero ( i.e. _ small step size _ ) but then a long chain is required to explore a substantial part of the state space . if a diffused proposal is used then the acceptance rate drops . for",
    "a multi  modal target ( which is not known a priori in most cases ) both the rwmh and the lmh chain may remain stuck at one or few of the modes and may still pass convergence diagnostics . obviously any inference based on such samples will be incorrect .",
    "also , an important property like geometric ergodicity which are sufficient for clt type results of ergodic averages are either not satisfied by these algorithms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples ) or some strong assumption on @xmath8 is needed . for example geometric ergodicity to hold for rwmh",
    "it is necessary ( and sufficient ) that the target density is _ log - concave in the tail _",
    "a density @xmath1 continuous and positive on @xmath0  is log - concave in the tail if there exists an @xmath15 and some @xmath16 such that @xmath17 and similarly lmh is also geometrically ergodic under a strong assumption given in theorem 4.1 of @xcite .",
    "these conditions are not satisfied for a large class of densities ( e.g. the densities with thick - tails ) .",
    "thus a mh method which allows the proposed state to be far away from the current state and yet has good acceptance rate will be of much use in the statistical computing problems .",
    "it is even better if the algorithm is geometrically ergodic for a class of densities much larger than the classes for which this property is enjoyed by the standard algorithms . in this article",
    "we propose a new mh algorithm based on multiplying a random quantity with the states .",
    "even if the algorithm appears simple we found that it has excellent convergence and mixing properties .",
    "it can explore the state space quite faster than the standard mcmc algorithms and has geometric ergodicity property for a huge class of target densities , for which the standard algorithms fails to be geometric ergodic .",
    "the main reason for this is because the dives can be made large or small each with significant probabilities .",
    "if the random multiplier is close to one , then the proposed point will be close to the current state and conversely . in rwmh , however , this proposal can not be controlled easily .",
    "if the step size is chosen large then most of the proposed points would be far away from the current states and if the step size is chosen small then most of the proposed points would be very close to the current states .",
    "there is obviously one issue with this algorithm  the origin is an absorbing state .",
    "however , this is not vital since in major practical problems the variables are continuous and the origin has no mass .",
    "thus we can safely remove it from the state space without disturbing the convergence .",
    "we emphasize that the rdmh algorithm exploits the multiplicative group structure of @xmath18 .",
    "the algorithm fails when the origin has positive probability attached to it ( for example , when the state - space is the set of integers ) .",
    "the rwmh agorithm still work in that case .",
    "in other problems such as bayesian testing with point null hypothesis and two - sided alternative , where the target distribution has a continuous part and also has a mass at zero , both rdmh and rwmh fails .",
    "mcmc techniques being extremely popular , the literature is rich with algorithms  specialized or generic in nature .",
    "many of them are special cases of mh algorithms with different forms of proposal densities .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for book length discussions .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows .",
    "we describe the new algorithm in section [ sec : rdmh ] . as claimed already , the algorithm is _ new _ in the sense that it is completely different in concept and in structure from the available multiplicative random walk mh .",
    "this is discussed in details in section [ sec : dissimilarity ] .",
    "we discuss its convergence properties in section [ sec : convergence ] . in section [ sec : appl : multimodal ] we compare rdmh with the standard algorithms . specifically we consider a bimodal target and see how rdmh explores the modes while rwmh can not .",
    "we also consider an extreme mixture example where one of the components has very low dispersion compared to other .",
    "we then consider a thick tailed target for which rwmh is _ not _ geometric ergodic while rdmh _",
    "is_. in this example we see how asymptotic normality holds for the ergodic averages using rdmh while it fails to hold for the rwmh algorithm.in section [ sec : appli : pricedata ] we analyze a share price return data .",
    "typically in such problems the posterior of one or more parameters are thick - tailed and asymmetric .",
    "the data and mode we consider are analyzed in @xcite using gibbs sampler .",
    "we found that the gibbs sampler failed to explore the tail of the posterior of the location parameter while rdmh sampler did that with ease .",
    "we conclude this article with an outlook on further works in section [ sec : further ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is a target density function , probably unnormalized , on @xmath19 .",
    "at each iteration the algorithm proposes a state @xmath5 from the current state @xmath20 by multiplying a random quantity @xmath10 with @xmath20 ( i.e. @xmath21 ) .",
    "the proposal is accepted with some probability depending on @xmath20 and @xmath5 .",
    "we can classify the proposals into two classes depending on whether @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "we call the case where @xmath22 an _ inner dive _ and the case where @xmath24 an _ outer dive_. notice that an outer dive can also be obtained by dividing the state @xmath20 by an @xmath10 with @xmath25",
    ". hence we can restrict the set from which the random multiplier @xmath10 is drawn to the set @xmath26 .",
    "obviously the point zero is not considered so that the chain does not get stuck at zero . at each iteration",
    "we can take an inner dive or an outer dive at random .",
    "we call the chain symmetric if the probability for an inner dive is half and asymmetric otherwise . in this article",
    "we shall only consider the symmetric rdmh only .",
    "so with a proposal density @xmath27 for @xmath10 on @xmath28 , the algorithm is given in algorithm [ algo : unid ] .",
    "[ algo : unid ]    ' '' ''    height 1pt width    random dive mh on @xmath19    ' '' ''    height 1pt width    * input : initial value @xmath29 , and number of iterations @xmath30 .",
    "* for @xmath31 1 .",

    "set @xmath38 * end for    ' '' ''    height 1pt width    notice that rdmh _ is _ an mh algorithm with @xmath39 hence it follows that @xmath8 is indeed stationary for the chain .",
    "however other properties do not follow easily  the assumptions in general results discussed in @xcite do not hold in this case . we prove them separately in the following section .",
    "notice also that the terms @xmath40 or its inverse in the acceptance ratios correspond to the jacobian of the transformations : @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the acceptance ratios are free from the proposal density @xmath43 as in rwmh .    for each @xmath44",
    "we define the inner and outer acceptance regions respectively as , @xmath45 let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the potential inner and outer rejection regions respectively .",
    "we see that for each @xmath48 , the rejection probability is given by @xmath49 substituting @xmath50 in the first integral and @xmath51 in the second we get , @xmath52    obviously , in any mh algorithm the proposal density plays an important role in terms of convergence . in this case also a good choice of @xmath43 is needed for faster convergence .",
    "however as we shall see in theorem [ thm : geoerg ] that the chain is geometric ergodic under an extremely weak restriction on @xmath43 .",
    "hence the discussion on the choices of @xmath43 is postponed till the end of section [ sec : convergence ] .",
    "it is quite straightforward to extend the algorithm to higher dimensions .",
    "the variables may be updated either sequentially or jointly .",
    "while updating jointly at each iteration , outer dives should be applied to a random number of components ( which may be zero ) and inner dives to the rest .",
    "the jacobian terms in the acceptance ratios will then be ratios of products of @xmath10 s .",
    "the algorithm is given in algorithm [ algo : highd ] of section [ sec : further ] .",
    "it is already seen that the rdmh algorithm _ is _ a special case of mh class of algorithms . however , it is _ not _ in any case similar to the random walk type algorithms .",
    "the term _ multiplicative random walk _ ( also known as the log - random walk mh ) is not new in the statistics literature .",
    "however , it has been developed only when the state space is the positive half of the real line as @xmath53 where @xmath54",
    "are i.i.d following some distributions on the real line ( see , dellaportas and roberts , 2003 , pp .",
    "18 for details and jasra _ et .",
    "al . _ , 2005 , for application ) .",
    "obviously this reduces to the simple rwmh on @xmath19 by observing that @xmath55 .",
    "it is useless for problems having entire real line as support because a part of the state space is never visited ( i.e the chain becomes _ reducible _ ) , that is , positive ( negative ) initial values restrict the chain to take only positive ( respectively negative ) values .",
    "the rdmh , however , is developed when the state sapce is entire real line .",
    "the term @xmath56 above can not be equal to @xmath57 since @xmath57 can take both positive and negative values .",
    "hence the rdmh algorithm can not be considered as a special case of log - random walk mh . for distributions with @xmath58 as support",
    "the obvious way to emply rdmh is to reparametrize by taking logarithm so that the support becomes @xmath19 .",
    "let us denote the kernel the of the rdmh chain by @xmath59 .",
    "important properties like irreducibility and aperiodicity ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we choose @xmath43 , as the uniform distribution on @xmath26 i.e. @xmath247    , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    \\(a ) rwmh : @xmath248 , initial value : @xmath249 acceptance rate = 29.916% , ( b ) rwmh : @xmath248 , initial value : @xmath250 acceptance rate = 29.656% , ( c ) rwmh : @xmath251 , initial value : @xmath250 acceptance rate = 14.31% , ( d ) rdmh , initial value : @xmath252 , acceptance rate = 30.172%    [ fig : bimodal ]    for the rwmh , we choose the proposal @xmath253 for different choices of @xmath254 . figure [ fig : bimodal ]",
    "( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) shows that rwmh remains stuck at one of the modes for an arbitrary but reasonable choice of @xmath254 , and with arbitrary initial value .",
    "this indicates significant non - robustness of rwmh with respect to the initial value and the choice of @xmath254 even if it is geometric ergodic in this case . only when @xmath254 has been appropriately chosen , rwmh performs adequately ( figure [ fig : bimodal ] , panel ( c ) ) .",
    "we remark that such  right \" choice is possible only if bimodality of the target posterior is anticipated beforehand , which is unrealistic . even for the appropriate choice of @xmath254",
    "we notice that the acceptance rate of rwmh is rather small ( 14.31% ) .",
    "in contrast rdmh adequately explored the entire state space without requiring knowledge of the target density ( figure [ fig : bimodal ] , panel ( d ) ) , or tuning of the proposal .",
    "the acceptance rate , which is 30.172% , much encouraging compared to the rwmh algorithm .",
    "[ [ example-2 . ] ] example 2 .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + +    now we consider a more challenging case similar to one considered by @xcite in their example 2 .",
    "the target is a mixture of univariate normals : @xmath255 several specialized algorithms are available for such _ needle - in - haystack _",
    "problem among which the equi - energy sampler by @xcite is worth mentioning .",
    "the equi - energy sampler is extremely efficient once the tuning parameters are chosen carefully . for our purpose",
    "we chose few proposals at random and study their performances .",
    "in particular , we run each chain ( of length 30,000 each after discarding first 20,000 burn - ins ) 100 times and estimate @xmath256 , where @xmath257 denotes the markov chain . from table [",
    "tab : needle_example_table ] it can be seen that all the proposals work quite well .",
    "the third and fifth proposal results small m.s.es perhaps due to the fact that they put more weight near zero ( the multiplier is close to zero and hence so is the proposed state ) and one of the mode is at zero .",
    "however , since in practice , it need not be the case it might result in poor acceptance rates .",
    "so , a proposal that generates random multiplier close to 1 should be preferred .",
    ".mean , standard deviation and mean squared errors of @xmath258 for different proposals .",
    "the average acceptance rates are also reported . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xcite used a gibbs sampler approach with data - augmentation .",
    "they faced some numerical difficulties and perturbed the @xmath259 s slightly to resolve the numerical problems .",
    "the rdmh sampler , however , did not face any numerical problem .",
    "the results obtained by rdmh differs from the gibbs sampler perhaps due to this reason . actually , the posteriors of @xmath260 and @xmath235 were same whether we used gibbs sampler or not ( see the paper by @xcite for the gibbs sampler output ) .",
    "the posterior of @xmath261 were quite dissimilar for the rdmh and gibbs samplers .",
    "for the gibbs sampler the posterior was mainly concentrated between @xmath262 and @xmath263 while it was concentrated between @xmath264 and @xmath265 for the rdmh chain .",
    "clearly , the gibbs sampler fails to cover the long tail of the posterior of @xmath261 while the rdmh explores it quite easily .    to ensure we also ran a random walk mh sampler and found that the results for the rwmh sampler coincided with that of the rdmh sampler .",
    "the summaries of the rdmh sampler is given in table [ tab : post_beta_sigma ] and [ tab : post_nu_gam ] and the histograms and traceplots of the same are given in figure [ fig : hist_pricedata ] and [ fig : trace_pricedata ] respectively .",
    "the autocorrelation plots of the rdmh chains are given in figure [ fig : acf_price ] .",
    "we ran the sampler for 160,000 iterations and discarded the first 10,000 samples as burn - ins .",
    "we then thinned the remaining 150,000 samples by 5 .",
    "convergence was achieved much earlier though .",
    "we also found that the mixing for the rdmh sampler was superior to that of the rwmh sampler .",
    "we conclude this article with some purview of possible extension to higher dimension .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a density supported on @xmath266 and @xmath43 is density on @xmath267 .",
    "then the algorithm is given in algorithm [ algo : highd ] .",

    "it is also harris recurrent on @xmath279 and every compact subset of @xmath279 is still small .",
    "the proof is along the same line as theorem [ thm : ergodicity ] and [ thm : smallset ] .",
    "geometric ergodicity is , however , a property that requires a different approach .",
    "it is expected that geometric ergodicity of this algorithm still holds for a large class of densities ( especially the thick - tailed ones ) on higher dimensions .",
    "we hope that this article would draw attention of the researchers and the question regarding geometric ergodicity in higher dimension situation would be settled .",
    "the proposal density @xmath280 on @xmath267 can be chosen to be the product of proposal densities on @xmath28 .",
    "in such a case , one should choose the univariate proposals which generate @xmath10 s close to 1 with high probabilities each ( for example , the mixture proposals in section [ sec : appli : pricedata ] ) .",
    "this will ensure that the proposed states are not too far away from the current state ( in @xmath266 ) to reduce the acceptance rate significantly .",
    "thanks are due to two anonymous referees whose critical reading of the manuscript and constructive comments lead to major improvement of the paper ."
