    "a simple parametrization of the timing resolution of time - of - flight ( tof ) detectors , based on scintillation counters , is given in references  @xcite : @xmath0 where : @xmath1 is the scintillator response , @xmath2 the photomultiplier ( pmt ) jitter , @xmath3 the path lengths variations , @xmath4 the jitter of the electronic readout system and @xmath5 is the average number of photoelectrons .",
    "the dominant factors for @xmath6 are @xmath5 and the counter dimensions ( mainly its length l ) , responsible for path lengths fluctuations . below 100 ps , contributions such as @xmath2 become increasingly important .",
    "as the pmt signals of a tof system are commonly fed into a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) after a leading edge discriminator , a relevant reduction in pmt gain ( as happens inside magnetic fields ) is to be avoided , to prevent increasing and less reliable time - walk corrections .    as a consequence , the operation inside even moderate magnetic fields ( up to some hundreds of gauss ) , such as stray fields of magnets , puts severe requirements on the properties of the used photomultipliers , for what concerns gain and timing properties .",
    "the more common solution for conventional pmts is to use local shieldings , made of a cylindrical envelope of high permeability material , such as @xmath7 metal .",
    "the shielding factor is proportional to the relative magnetic permeability @xmath8 of the used material multiplied by some ( non - negligible ) geometric factor .",
    "high permeability alloys are available , but saturation effects limit their use to low external magnetic fields ( up to 50 - 100 gauss ) . to reduce this effect the shield radius may be increased .",
    "as these materials are quite expensive , a common solution is to use in addition to a thin , high permeability inner shield , a thick soft iron external shield .",
    "these composite shieldings are quite effective to suppress the orthogonal component of the magnetic field @xmath9 , but problems may arise for the axial component @xmath10 , parallel to the pmt axis . while formulas to compute the `` shielding factor '' for orthogonal fields are easily available @xcite , results for the shielding of the axial component of a magnetic field are less common .",
    "fine - mesh dynodes pmts are instead nearly insensitive to the axial component of the magnetic field @xmath10 , but may have problems with an increasing transverse component @xmath9 . these tubes become totally unusable for orientations of the pmt axis , with respect to the magnetic field , bigger than a critical value @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) even in small magnetic fields ( @xmath13 gauss ) .",
    "the structure of these pmts is based on a sequence of fine - mesh electrodes , where the incoming electrons are multiplied by secondary emission .",
    "the electrons in the final stage are collected by the anode as output signal .",
    "the distance between the first dynode and the photocathode is @xmath14 mm , while the distance between successive dynodes is @xmath15 mm .    in the following , results on conventional 1 `` r4998 and r9800 pmts and fine mesh 1 '' , 1.5 `` , 2 '' r5505 , r7761 and r5924 pmts from hamamatsu",

    "the relevant properties are the transit time spread ( tts ) and the pmt size that may have an effect on it , by an increasing photocathode area ( with a wider photoelectrons spatial distribution ) .",
    "for this reason this paper will report mainly about the smaller size ( 1 \" ) pmts , that have better timing properties .",
    "systematic studies of conventional pmts have been performed , using a built on purpose solenoid of 23 cm inner diameter , 40 cm length  .",
    "the solenoid being a resistive magnet , special care was put into the thermal resistance of the assembly ( up to @xmath17 ) , using special insulating paints . for part of the tests a digimess 3040 laboratory power supply ( 0 - 32 v , 0 - 40 a ) was used . for larger field",
    "amplitudes an eutron power supply ( 0 - 32 v , 0 - 100 a ) was employed .",
    "the main constraint was the heating of the windings that limited the maximum circulating current to about 55 a ( corresponding to a maximum field of @xmath18 600 gauss ) , due to the increase of conductor resistance giving higher voltage drops ( up to the maximum allowed value of @xmath19 ) .",
    "the large open bore allows tests both with field lines orthogonal or parallel to the pmt axis .",
    "the magnetic field was measured with a gaussmeter  , with a relative accuracy better than @xmath20 .",
    "the * b * field calibration curve is shown in figure [ fig : mag2 ] at the center of the solenoid and at different @xmath21 positions shifted along its longitudinal axis .        from simulations using a finite length solenoid approximation and performed measurements ,",
    "a field uniformity better than @xmath22 may be assumed at the center of the test solenoid in a volume of about @xmath23 .    a fast light pulse ( @xmath15 ns width , to simulate a typical scintillator signal )   ps risetime ) and an avx - s1 output module .",
    "laser pulses at @xmath24 , with a fwhm between @xmath25 ps and @xmath26 ns were obtained .",

    "ps / m , see @xcite . ] inserted in a small plexiglas cover in front of the pmt window . to provide light signals of various intensities ,",
    "the laser spot was injected into the optical fiber by a 10x newport microscope objective , after removable absorptive neutral density filters .",
    "a broadband beamsplitter ( bs ) divided the laser beam to give @xmath27 of light on the fiber injection system and @xmath28 on a fast thorlabs det10a photodiode ( risetime @xmath15 ns ) , to monitor the laser system stability .",
    "tests were carried out with a signal corresponding to about 150 - 300 photoelectrons : ) was estimated via absolute gain measurement .",
    "this number was cross - checked with powermeter measurements . ] a typical value for a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) crossing a 1 `` to 2''-thick scintillator .",
    "the optical power was periodically monitored with an ophir nova laser powermeter .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the pmt signal was input after a passive splitter to a digital scope   triggered by the laser synchronization output signal ( sync .",
    "out ) with a maximum jitter of @xmath29 ps with respect to the delivered optical pulse and to a silena 8950 multichannel analyzer ( mca ) . for timing measurements ,",
    "the mca chain was used with a silena 7422 charge - amplitude - time converter ( qvt ) . the pmt anode signal after a leading edge pls 707 discriminator provided the stop signal ( @xmath30 ) , while the start signal ( @xmath31 ) was given by the sync out of the laser pulser after a suitable delay and an ortec pulse inverter .        in timing measurements ,",
    "the time difference @xmath32 is measured .",
    "this accounts for delay in cables and electronics and jitter in the transit time in the tested pmts .",
    "no variation of this quantity or no deterioration in the fwhm of its distribution , after increasing the magnetic field intensity , demonstrates the effectiveness of the adopted shielding solution .      as conventional photomultipliers may work without major problems inside a residual magnetic field of a few gauss , a preliminary estimate of their expected behaviour",
    "may be obtained from magnetostatics simulations .",
    "the residual longitudinal magnetic field inside a @xmath16-metal shielding or a composite shielding made of a soft iron cylinder surrounding a mu - metal shield may be easily calculated with 2-d magnetostatics simulation programs .",
    "results are reported in figure [ fig - mag ] as an example , using the public domain 2-d magnetostatics program femm 4.2 @xcite . from the reported simulation results ,",
    "it is evident that the more the pmt is moved inside the external shielding , the smaller is the value of the sensed residual magnetic field up to a plateau .",
    "this reduction , for the @xmath7metal shielding works only up to fields @xmath33 gauss , where the residual magnetic field begins to increase again .",
    "the situation is more difficult to handle for composite shieldings with no azymuthal symmetry , such as the ones with box - shaped soft iron external shieldings ( discussed later ) , where more complicate 3-d magnetostatics programs may be needed .    in these cases we prefer to rely on experimental results , such as the ones reported in the following .",
    "the pmts under test were put in the central region of the solenoid , using a support to incline them from @xmath34 to @xmath35 with respect to the magnet field lines ( from * b@xmath36 * to * b@xmath37 * ) .",
    "environment light was accurately masked , to reduce noise .",
    "measurements were performed to see gain reduction and possible deterioration in timing resolution as a function of the magnetic field value ( * b * ) and the relative orientation angle ( @xmath38 ) , between the pmt axis and the magnetic field .",
    "the tested shielding solutions were the @xmath16-metal shielding only option ( 1 mm thick @xmath16-metal ) and various options with additional shields made of soft iron   and a reduced area hysteresis loop ] in box or cylindrical shapes . as the magnetic shielding is mainly a `` mass effect '' we may expect , for similar transverse dimensions , box - shaped shieldings to be more effective than cylindrical ones , having more shielding mass  .",
    "the tests have been carried out with various shielding configurations :    * only @xmath16-metal  .",
    "] shielding ( 1 mm thick , 15 cm long : extending 3 cm beyond the photocathode area ) ; * a 15 cm long iron cylinder of diameter 5 or 6 cm with a central hole of 3.2 cm diameter ( to accomodate inside the pmt assembly with a 1 mm thick @xmath7metal shielding ) made of fe 360 soft iron   and a maximum relative permeability @xmath39 . ] ; * a 15 cm long iron box of transverse area @xmath40 or @xmath41 with a central hole of 3.2 cm diameter ( to accomodate the pmt assembly ) made of different iron types : fe360 soft iron or armco .   and a magnetic saturation ( * j = b - h * ) of 2.15 wb/@xmath42 , much higher than available commercial soft iron",
    ". its maximum relative permeability is @xmath43 . ] * the previous two configurations , moving the pmt assembly 1 , 2 or 3 cm inside the edge of the iron shielding    results with only the @xmath16-metal shielding were reported in reference @xcite and show that r4998 pmts perform satisfactorily for longitudinal * b@xmath36 * fields up to @xmath33 gauss and for orthogonal * b@xmath37 * fields up to @xmath44 gauss .",
    "inside an orthogonal magnetic field * b@xmath37 * , no effect larger than a few per - cent is seen for fields up to @xmath45 500 - 600 gauss using any of the previously described composite shieldings .",
    "so we focussed our efforts only on the study of pmts inside longitudinal magnetic fields .",
    "figure [ fig : shield ] ( top left - hand panel ) shows the signal reduction for a typical r4998 pmt , with different shielding options : @xmath16-metal only or @xmath16-metal with additional soft iron shieldings , in a longitudinal magnetic field *",
    "b@xmath36*. for equivalent shield sizes , the box - shaped iron shielding is clearly more effective than the conventional cylindrical one .",
    "figure [ fig : test8 ] shows a comparison for the different box - shaped composite shieldings ( signal reduction and timing versus the magnetic field intensity * b * ) for the average and rms of a sample of ten r4998 pmts .",
    "the shielding effect may be increased , by moving the pmt assembly more inside the shielding box , as shown in figures [ fig : test3]-[fig : test4 ] for a 5x 5 cm fe360 shielding , in addition to the @xmath7metal one .                as a general conclusion",
    ", we see that :    * very low carbon content iron ( armco ) is more effective than standard fe360 , even if this latter is acceptable for fields up to 500 g * box - shaped soft iron shields are more effective than round - shaped ones of similar size * as expected , more massive shieldings ( from @xmath46 to @xmath41 transverse area ) are better * extending the external soft iron shielding beyond the @xmath16-metal shielding improves the performance    the effectiveness of box - shaped iron shielding , in addition to @xmath16-metal , for conventional pmts has been tested also with other types of pmts .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : shield ] shows the results for a typical hamamatsu 1 \" r9800 conventional pmt , using a @xmath16-metal shielding only and various types of soft iron ( fe360 or armco ) box shieldings .",
    "no deterioration in gain is seen up to @xmath47 gauss for * b@xmath36 *  .",
    "as long as the pmt signal amplitude has a sizeable pulse - height no deterioration in timing is seen .",
    "-metal shielding or the 1 mm thick @xmath48 shielding + @xmath46 fe360 box shielding some effect was evident in timing ( @xmath49 or its fwhm ) , at the @xmath50 level , when the signal amplitude experienced a reduction of a factor @xmath51 in one case or two in the other . ] as local shielding is mainly a mass effect we may expect an improvement if shieldings of individual pmts are put in magnetic contact .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure [ fig : shield ] ( top right - hand panel ) where an additional iron box of similar shape is put in magnetic contact with the iron box shielding the pmt .",
    "this is the more common situation for detectors with an array of similar channels , where shielding may be improved by simply putting all soft iron individual external shields in magnetic contact .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in our studies are coming mainly from :    1 .",
    "uniformity of the magnetic field ( better than 3% ) , 2 .",
    "stability of the laser pulse intensity ( better than 2% ) , 3 .",
    "error in positioning of pmts inside the magnetic field .",
    "the simple mechanics of the system allowed a reproducibility of the positioning of the different pmts at the level of some mm .",
    "every single measurement referred to about 500 - 1000 events , giving a negligible statistical error as compared to systematics .",
    "from all the previous sources of errors , we may conservatively estimate a measurement error around @xmath52 .",
    "no detailed study was done to assess possible azimuthal angle effects on the pmts and hysteresis effects in the shielding .    as expected pmts",
    "behave well for orientation of the * b * field orthogonal to the pmt axis ( @xmath53 ) , where the shielding effect is maximal , while along the pmt axis ( @xmath34 ) the gain reduction is more marked .",
    "conventional pmts may be shielded effectively up to longitudinal fields @xmath54 gauss , with simple composite shieldings using @xmath7metal and soft iron box - shaped shields . for larger magnetic fields ,",
    "fine - mesh pmts may be a better option , even if some additional care must be taken for what regards their orientation with respect to the magnetic field ( see next section for typical results ) .",
    "systematic studies have been carried out also for 1 `` ( r5505 ) , 1.5 '' ( r7761 ) and 2 \" ( r5924 ) hamamatsu fine - mesh pmts ( see table [ tab1 ] for more details ) .",
    "they were delivered by hamamatsu as assemblies with a resistive divider base and a 1 mm thick @xmath7metal shielding , cut at the photocathode edge .",
    "a refurbished resistive dipole magnet at lasa ( infn milano ) , with magnetic fields up to 1.2 t and an open gap of 12 cm , was used .",
    "the test setup was similar to the one employed for the tests of conventional pmts , aside the use of a plp-10 hamamatsu laser   nm , with 60 ps fwhm pulse width and max repetition rate 100 mhz ] .",
    "data were acquired , after a passive splitter , both for amplitude measurements ( via a caen vme v465 qadc ) and for timing measurements ( via a caen vme v480 tdc , with a resolution of 25 ps / ch ) .",
    "the laser sync out , that had a maximum jitter of @xmath55 ps with respect to the optical pulse , provided in both cases the start / gate signal .",
    "tests were usually done with a signal corresponding to about 300 photoelectrons ( p.e . ) .",
    "the optical power was periodically monitored with an ophir pd-2a laser powermeter .",
    "the pmts under test were inserted in the central region of the test magnet , where the field had a uniformity of @xmath56 , using plexiglass supports to incline them up to @xmath57 with respect to the b field lines .",
    "gain reduction and timing resolution were measured as a function of magnetic field and relative orientation angle ( @xmath38 ) for the three types of fine - mesh pmts under study . due to the effect of magnetic field on the accelerated electrons inside the pmts",
    "we can expect a reduction of gain as the b field increases and also a marked dependence of the relative gain as a function of the orientation @xmath38 angle .",
    "the gain reduction as a function of the increasing magnetic field at various values of @xmath38 are shown for typical 1``,1.5'',2 \" fine - mesh pmts in figure [ fig-1inch ]  .",
    "a more detailed study of the effect of the pmt orientation with respect to the magnetic field was performed at moderate values of the magnetic field ( up to @xmath47 gauss ) with the same setup used for the tests of conventional pmts . results for a typical 1 `` or 1.5 '' fine - mesh pmt are also reported in figure [ fig-1inch ] .",
    "the decrease of the relative gain at large values of @xmath38 is connected to secondary electron losses : large angle electrons fall out the grid surfaces and are lost .",
    "the deflection of particle trajectories is also responsible for the enhancement of gain up to a certain value of @xmath38 .",
    "fine - mesh pmts are well behaving up to a critical orientation @xmath11 depending on the size of the projection of the photocathode onto the anode , with respect to the magnetic field direction : typically @xmath58 .",
    "for an orientation angle @xmath38 exceeding the critical angle @xmath11 the gain of a fine - mesh pmt has a noticeable decrease and shows a complicate behaviour , as the magnetic field * b * increases , up to @xmath38 values ( @xmath59 ) beyond which the gain shows a steep drop in gain . this effect may be reduced by using a composite shielding solution similar to the one adopted for conventional pmts .",
    "timing characteristics of fine - mesh pmts show a weak dependence from the field strength and direction up to @xmath60 t , in spite of the large gain reduction , as also shown in figure [ fig-1inch ] for @xmath61 .",
    "measurements have been performed up to longitudinal fields of 600 g for a sample of conventional r4998 pmts , with different shielding options .",
    "while a simple 1-mm thick @xmath16-metal shielding is satisfactory up to 60 ( 150 ) g for an axial ( orthogonal ) * b * field , an additional armco ( @xmath41 ) shield is required for longitudinal ( orthogonal ) fields up to 600 g.    additional measurements for fine - mesh pmts in magnetic fields up to 1.2 t ( see @xcite for additional details ) show that fine - mesh pmts are insensitive to longitudinal magnetic fields up to @xmath15 t. however their performance degrades quickly for orientation angles larger than a critical value ( @xmath11 ) , even at small values of the magnetic field .",
    "this critical angle is typically in the range @xmath62 .",
    "the previous results may be of interest for the optimization of time - of - flight detectors , based on scintillation counters read by pmts , that have to work inside moderate magnetic field or the fringe fields of high magnetic fields .",
    "tof detector timing resolutions show comparable results with both conventional r4998 pmts or fine - mesh r5505 pmts , see reference @xcite for more details .",
