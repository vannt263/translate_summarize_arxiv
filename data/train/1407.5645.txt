    "metal oxide surfaces and interfaces involving metal oxides have been , and continue to be , a subject of significant scientific and technological interest due to the fact that metal oxides display a wide range of physical basic science phenomena that are simultaneously useful in technological applications . for example , oxide surfaces are used for catalysis or as gas sensors,@xcite oxide insulators are ubiquitous as gate insulators in transistors , and recent advances in layer - by - layer growth have triggered great activity in the study and design of oxide heterostructures.@xcite in addition , the physical and chemical properties of metal oxides in thin film form can differ substantially from those of their bulk forms , as these properties are affected strongly by the presence of surfaces and interfaces and especially the substrate .",
    "a classical example is provided by ultrathin films of an oxide such as mgo on a metallic substrate where electron transfer from the metal to the surface of the oxide can drive oxidation and other reactions.@xcite    from the viewpoint of direct characterization of oxide thin films in real space , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) is readily able to visualize the surface of a system .",
    "a more intriguing possibility is to attempt to use stm on the surface of an oxide thin film to learn about the buried interface below the surface .",
    "if one can selectively probe the interface versus the surface by , e.g. , tuning the bias voltage , one has on hand a powerful method to study interfaces at the atomic scale and in real space without the requirement of long - range order typical of diffraction based methods.@xcite    one of the prototypical metal / oxide interfaces that has been studied extensively using stm in the past two decades is the @xmath0/mgo interface , where @xmath0 is either mo or ag .",
    "let us briefly summarize the key findings about this system .",
    "gallagher _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite performed a scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) study on a thin mgo film grown on the ( 001 ) surface of mo and were able to obtain stm images for mgo thicknesses up to 25    despite the insulating nature of mgo .",
    "schintke _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) as well as first - principles calculations on a thin mgo film on ag ( 001 ) and found that the sts spectrum was essentially flat for a range of bias voltages between @xmath1 and @xmath2 v ; the first peak in the sts spectrum at @xmath3 v for the thinnest films disappeared with mgo thickness whereas a peak at @xmath4 v remained constant with thickness .",
    "the thickness independence permitted an identification of the 2.5 v feature with electronic states belonging to the mgo which yielded an estimated band gap of 6.5 v for mgo . the density functional theory ( dft )",
    "calculations of the local density of states ( ldos ) for mgo thicknesses between 0 and 3 atomic layers in the same work found a good agreement with their experimental results .",
    "their main conclusion was that for bias voltages within the mgo band gap , the stm is probing ag states through the mgo layer and that ultrathin mgo is required since the ag wave functions decay exponentially in the insulating regions .",
    "lopez and valeri@xcite performed dft calculations of the mgo / ag ( 001 ) system for one and two layers of mgo including several calculations with missing oxygen atoms .",
    "they calculated stm images within the tersoff - hamann approximation.@xcite their main conclusions were in agreement with the findings of schintke _ _ et al.__@xcite : at low bias voltages , the ag states at the interface are probed whereas at high positive bias voltage the surface of mgo is probed . within this pictures ,",
    "if an oxygen atom is missing at the mgo / ag interface , one would expect to see a bright stm feature on top of the vacancy at low voltages from the ag atom just below the vacancy , but such a bright feature was not actually seen , a difference attributed to geometrical effects due to the relaxation of the top mgo layer .",
    "we note that in the case of the mgo / ag ( 001 ) system , the mgo film is commensurate with the ag substrate so that mg and o atoms are in vertical registry with the ag atoms along the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "furthermore , the rock - salt nature of mgo insures that cation and anion atoms in consecutive ( 001 ) atomic layers switch identity . in these conditions ,",
    "assignment of observed stm features is ambiguous in theory and experiment .",
    "a typical tool used theoretically is an analysis of the projected density of states ( pdos ) onto the constituent atoms .",
    "the pdos is very useful as it directly identifies which atoms can contribute to tunneling at a given bias voltage , but unfortunately mere existence of a nonzero pdos on some atom at a certain energy does not tell us to what extent the atomic orbitals of that atom actually contribute to the stm tunneling signal above the surface .",
    "hence , we believe that a more detailed theoretical investigation of this model system is necessary to determine precisely what electronic states are actually being observed in the surface stm measurement .    in this work , we have used a variety of first - principles calculations and analyses to study the origin and formation of the stm signal above the surface .",
    "all results show that the stm signal at low bias ( _ i.e. _ , at the fermi level ) is completely dominated by the contribution of the atomic orbitals of the topmost mgo surface layer ; atomic orbitals belonging to ag atoms in the substrate make a negligible contribution . nevertheless",
    ", since the mgo film is insulating , the states at the fermi level that are being imaged begin in the ag substrate , couple to the atomic orbitals of the mgo in the interfacial region , and decay evanescently through the film on their way to the surface : the coupling is best understood as being through the lattice of the mgo and its associated atomic orbitals . unfortunately , the nature of the ag - mgo coupling turns out to be complex and consists of interfering paths via both valence and conduction band states of the mgo film .",
    "the body of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : comp ] describes the details of our numerical simulations .",
    "then the main results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the results are further analyzed using a simplified tight - binding model is sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the key findings are summarized in sec.[sec : summary ] where we also provide our outlook for future work in this general area .",
    "our first - principles calculations use dft within the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew and wang ( pw91).@xcite we employ a planewave pseudopotential approach utilizing vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite as implemented in the quantum espresso software package.@xcite the atomic configurations and cutoff radii used for pseudopotential generation are shown in table  [ tab : pseudo ] . for ag and mg atoms ,",
    "non - linear core corrections are employed.@xcite the planewave kinetic energy and charge density cutoffs are 35 ry and 280 ry , respectively .",
    "supercells in the form of two - dimensional slabs are constructed with 3 monolayers ( ml ) of face - centered cubic ag with ( 001 ) surface orientation and various thicknesses of rock - salt mgo .",
    "below , we label the mgo thickness by the number of ml ( atomic planes ) comprising the film .",
    "the supercells contain a vacuum region of at least 20 that separates each slab from its periodic images .",
    "in addition , to ensure the absence of long - ranged electrostatic interactions between the periodic slabs , we use the dipole correction technique@xcite to eliminate any electric field in the vacuum region entirely .    for a primitive interfacial unit cell that simulates mgo epitaxial to the ag substrate ( fig .  [",
    "fig : slab ] ) , a @xmath5 @xmath6-point sampling of the 2-dimensional brillouin zone is employed .",
    "equivalent meshes of @xmath6 points are used for larger supercells .",
    "for stm simulations , we use the tersoff - hamann approximation.@xcite the main focus of the present work is on low - bias stm analysis for which tersoff - hamann approximation is an appropriate choice . specifically , since at low bias the stm current is proportional to the ldos at the fermi level @xmath7 , we will be using the theoretically calculated ldos as a surrogate for the stm signal , and will use the two terms interchangeably .    in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we will be constructing a tight - binding description of the mgo / ag system .",
    "the atomic orbitals comprising the tight - binding basis are those included in the pseudopotential generation and are listed in table  [ tab : pseudo ] . in this basis , we compute matrix elements of the kohn - sham hamiltonian as well as the atomic orbital overlap matrices .",
    "this starting basis is normalized but not orthogonal ( orbitals on different atoms have non - zero overlap ) . in certain parts of the analysis in section [ sec : model ] , it is helpful to have an orthonormal atomic orbital basis : we use the lwdin transformation to arrive at an equivalent set of orthonormal lwdin orbitals.@xcite finally , all projected density of states ( pdos ) in this work employ lwdin orbitals for the projections .",
    ".[tab : pseudo ] pseudopotential reference valence configurations and corresponding cutoff radii ( atomic units ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     summarizing the main findings of this section , the tight - binding approach is useful in that ( a ) it generates stm images which agree well with the full plane - wave results , ( b ) it allows one to unambiguously show that the stm image is generated by the electronic structure at @xmath7on the surface mgo layers , ( c ) that the mgo / ag separation @xmath8 controls the relative importance of ag - mg coupling and coupling of the states at @xmath7to the conduction band of the mgo film , and ( d ) it illustrates the complex nature of the coupling across the interface and its relation to the formation of the stm image .",
    "this coupling across this interfacial system is in fact quite delocalized in real space primarily due to the large spatial extent of the mg orbitals in the mgo overlayer .",
    "we expect similar complex and delocalized behavior at low bias in other metal / oxide interfaces where the key cationic atomic orbitals are large on the scale of the inter - atomic distances .",
    "conversely , if the cationic atomic states are localized to begin with , e.g. , the @xmath9 states of first row transition metals , the interpretation of the low - bias stm in terms of interfacial behavior may be significantly simplified .",
    "we have investigated the stm contrast at near - zero - bias voltage for thin mgo films on ag ( 001 ) substrates using dft first - principles simulations .",
    "we found that the stm images can not be simply and directly attributed to the states of the ag substrates .",
    "the stm image is in fact completely dominated by the contributions of the electronic states of the topmost mgo atomic plane on the surface of the film .",
    "hence , the stm image formation process is as follows : metallic states at the fermi level originate in the ag , couple to the mgo atomic orbitals ( or the mgo band states ) across the interface , propagate through the insulating mgo lattice , and evanescently decay on their way to the surface .",
    "the stm image thus is created by the amplitudes of these evanescent states at @xmath7on the surface atoms .",
    "our results show that the cross - interfacial coupling is complex and long - ranged in this system , defying the simplest nearest - neighbor analysis in terms of contributions solely at short range across the interface .",
    "the complex behavior is caused primarily by the large spatial extent of the mg @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 states that dominate the conduction band of the mgo film .",
    "we have observed that there are at least two paths for the propagation of the electronic states across the interface , and that they interfere in a complicated manner when forming the stm image above the surface .    in the process of the analysis ,",
    "we have developed a simple tight - binding method that successfully reproduces the stm contrast computed from the more accurate plane - wave calculations .",
    "the tight - binding approach permits a variety of analyses to be performed on how the stm image is formed , what information it carries , and the key atomic orbitals that determine its overall behavior .",
    "the method is general and applicable to other interfacial systems .    finally , while this particular interfacial system features delocalized couplings which make simple analysis difficult , the main culprit is the large extent of the cation mg atomic states that dominate the conduction bands of the mgo .",
    "hence , systems where both the conduction and valence bands of the insulating overlayer are dominated by localized orbitals are preferred : in such a situation , one has a better chance of extracting information on the localized behavior of the buried information from the stm image on the surface .",
    "for example , metal oxide films incorporating @xmath9 transition metals should be good candidates for future studies due to the spatial locality of the @xmath9 orbitals .",
