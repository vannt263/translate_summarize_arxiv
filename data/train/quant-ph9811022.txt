    "the duality between wave and particle aspects is one of the central issues of quantum mechanics .",
    "much has been made of the particle aspects of photons , but the recent progress in cooling and controlling atomic motion has brought forward their wave mechanical behavior in a prominent way . the new field of atomic optics has emerged @xcite .    with modern cooling and trapping techniques , one can envisage controlled motion of atomic particles in structures whose mechanical dimensions match the heterostructures used in electronic circuits .",
    "neutral atoms can be stored in magneto - optical traps , and hnsch and his group has recently shown @xcite that such traps can be made very small , _ viz _ of the order of @xmath0 this requires high precision in the fabrication of the solid structures defining the dimensions of the trap .",
    "modern lithographic technology suggests that such structures could be made even much smaller , and then we can imagine experiments in traps of genuinely microscopic dimensions , where quantum effects would dominate the particle dynamics .",
    "hnsch has also suggested that such traps could be made into channels and structures , thus providing a tool to design arbitrary devices at the surface of a substrate .",
    "similar structures can be constructed by combining charged wires with evanescent wave mirrors @xcite or magnetic mirrors @xcite .",
    "such combinations can be used to build up the structures utilized in nano - electronics .",
    "the use of wires to guide atomic motion has been investigated by denschlag and schmiedmayer @xcite .",
    "schmiedmayer has also discussed the use of such structures to construct quantum dots and quantum wires for atoms @xcite .",
    "alternative ways to achieve guided motion and possibly controlled interaction between atoms is to utilize hollow optical fibers with evanescent waves trapping the atoms to narrow channels at the center of the fiber @xcite .",
    "these can eventually be fused to provide couplers similar to those used for optical signal transmission in fibers . also the pure atomic waveguide achievable by the use of hollow laser modes may be used .",
    "we see these methods as an opening to novel and innovative uses of particle traps . by arranging a network of grooves on a surface",
    ", we can launch particles ( wave packets ) into the various inputs of the system , let them propagate through the device and interact with its structures and each other .",
    "this may well provide an opportunity to design quantum apparatuses , process information and perform computations .",
    "the advantage is that both the structures and the input states are easy to control in an atomic environment .",
    "an equivalent point of view is expressed by schmiedmayer in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a next step in the experimental progress would be to observe the quantum character of atoms ( or possibly ions ) .",
    "an essential quantum characteristic of particles is their statistical behavior .",
    "the difference between bosons and fermions manifests itself dramatically in many situations .",
    "optical networks can be fed by a few photons only , and their quantum aspects have been utilized in experiments ranging from secure communication to tests of fundamental issues .",
    "recently zeilinger and his group @xcite have tested the behavior of two - photon states at beam splitters . using the overall symmetry properties of the states , they have been able to display both symmetric and antisymmetric behavior .",
    "similar experiments are in principle possible with electrons . in nanostructures",
    ", one can fabricate the devices simulating optical components , but it is far less trivial to launch single conduction electrons in well controlled states .",
    "yamamoto s group , however , has been able to show quantum correlations in an experiment which is the analogue of a beam splitter for photons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give an example of the multiparticle effects observable when particle states are launched along potential grooves on a surface .",

    "iii we present the details of the model chosen and a simplified analytic treatment demonstrating the main features expected of this model . in sec .",
    "iv we carry through a numerical analysis of the situation , for one particle as a two - dimensional propagation problem , but for two particles in a paraxial approximation . for non - interacting particles ,",
    "the expected behavior is found , but when particle interactions are added , the boson behavior is changed . for fermions",
    "the exclusion principle make them essentially insensitive to the interaction .",
    "an unexpected feature is found : the sign of the interaction is irrelevant for the effect . in sec .",
    "v this is explained within our simple analytic model , and , as a consequence , a certain universality is proposed : when the interaction strength over the tunneling frequency becomes of the order of @xmath1 , the noninteracting bosonic behavior is essentialy destroyed .",
    "this is verified by numerical calculations , reported in fig .",
    "finally sec .",
    "vi presents a discussion of parameter ranges in real materials , where our effects may be observable , and summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in order to show the opportunities offered by atomic networks , we investigate the manifestations of quantum statistics on an experiment emulating the behavior of photons in beam splitters . this is a straightforward approach , which enables us to display the potentialities and limitations of such treatments .",
    "our work has been motivated by the statistics displayed by a 50 - 50 beam splitter , which has been used in the experiments by the zeilinger group @xcite .",

    "photons are ideal for experiments , they do not interact mutually and they propagate essentially undisturbed in vacuum . as models for quantum systems , they have the drawback that they can not be localized , their wave packets are of rather elusive character , and the influence of particle interactions can not be established .",

    "<S> we regain the results known from photon experiments , but we have found that particle interactions destroy the perfect bosonic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> fermions avoid each other due to the exclusion principle and hence they are far less sensitive to particle interactions . for bosons , the behavior can be explained with simple analytic considerations which predict a certain amount of universality . </S>",
