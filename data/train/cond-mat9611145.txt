    "the decreasing size of semiconductor devices requires precise control of device structures , particularly dopant distributions .",
    "ion implantation introduces energetic charged atomic particles in a substrate for the purpose of changing electrical , metallurgical and chemical properties of the substrate .",
    "the wide use of ion implantation is due to its precise control over total dopant doses , depth profiles and the area uniformity .",
    "however , ion implantation induces transient enhanced diffusion ( ted ) of dopants : the diffusivity of the dopants is abnormally enhanced for a transient period of time after ion - implantation .",
    "@xcite many studies have suggested that lattice damages , introduced during ion implantation , are responsible for fast diffusion of dopants .",
    "@xcite    in particular , the diffusivity of boron during annealing in ion - implanted samples is enhanced by many orders of magnitude greater than b diffusivity in a thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xcite this transient enhanced diffusion of b places limitations of the use of b@xmath4-implantation in fabricating submicron devices .",
    "boron ted occurs due to excessive si interstitials , which are created by b@xmath4-implantation and contribute to the fast diffusion of b.  @xcite the boron diffusion via pairing of b and si interstitials has been supported by experiments and theories .",
    "@xcite experiments observe enhancement of the b diffusivity when si interstitials are selectively injected by surface oxidation  @xcite and by si@xmath4-implantation .",
    "@xcite first principle calculations reported that the activation energy of b diffusion associated with si interstitials is the lowest among possible diffusion mechanisms .",
    "@xcite therefore , the concentration of si interstitials after the ion implantation and during the thermal annealing process is an important parameter to determine the final depth profile of b in the ion - implanted samples .",
    "the concentration of si interstitials depends on ( 1 ) the ion implantation conditions  the incident energy and the dose  and ( 2 ) the temperature at which thermal annealing is performed .",
    "implantation at a higher incident energy or with a higher dose of the ions generates more si interstitials .",
    "as the name transient enhanced diffusion indicates , the enhancement factor of the b diffusivity decays as the thermal annealing proceeds , and eventually the diffusivity of the b converges to that in a thermal equilibrium .",
    "the temporal extent of the enhanced diffusion of b decrease at higher annealing temperatures , since the excessive si interstitials migrate to the regular lattice sites in a shorter period of time .",
    "@xcite it is observed that the temporal extent ( duration of the boron ted ) is exponentially activated .",
    "the activation energy , depending on the ion implantation conditions , shows a large variance : 15 ev .",
    "@xcite    this activation energy summarizes complex processes for b diffusion in ion - implanted samples  generation , diffusion and annihilation of the si interstitials as well as the interactions of b with the b and si interstitials .",

    "@xcite suggested that emission of si interstitials from particular extended defects , namely @xmath0 defects , causes the boron ted .",

    "the extended @xmath0 defects are detected under b@xmath4-implantation at an incident energy of few tens of kev  @xcite and the corresponding activation energy of the boron ted was obtained at 35 ev .",
    "@xcite the high value of the activation energy can be related to the stability of the @xmath0 defects with respect to isolated interstitials .",
    "however , boron ted has been also observed without detecting any macroscopic defect , when the energy of the b@xmath4-implantation decreases below 10 kev .",
    "@xcite a lower activation energy ( about 1 ev ) was estimated for this low - energy ion implantation .",
    "this low - energy b@xmath4-implantation experiment suggests that the formation of stable @xmath0 defects depends on the interstitial concentrations .",
    "furthermore , the observation of boron ted in the absence of the observable @xmath0 defects suggests that microscopic interstitial clusters may exist and contribute to the b diffusion by releasing interstitials at a lower energy cost .",
    "it is possible that the microscopic interstitial clusters are related to the @xmath0 defects and the formation and dissolution of the defects , from the interstitial clusters to the extended @xmath0 defects , can be explained by common mechanisms .",
    "the proposition that the @xmath0 defects are formed by condensation of interstitials and provide interstitial sources during boron ted has been supported by experiments using a variety of procedures to inject si interstitials into bulk systems : the @xmath0 defects are observed to be formed by surface oxidation ,  @xcite and by gev - electron irradiation  @xcite and by ion implantations .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath0 defects are often called _ rod - like _ , because they are typically elongated along the @xmath5 direction as much as a micron .  @xcite the width of the @xmath0 defects ranges 1  100 nm along the @xmath2 direction , perpendicular to the elongation direction .",
    "the name @xmath0 defects indicates the observed habit plane  @xcite on which the rod - like defects lie , namely the @xmath0 plane formed by the @xmath1 and @xmath6 directions .    here , we present total energy calculations based on the tight - binding hamiltonian scheme ( i ) to study the structural properties and energetics of the @xmath0 defects as function of their dimensions and interstitial concentrations and ( ii ) to find possible mechanisms of interstitial capture by and release from the @xmath0 defects .",

    "the last column of  shows that the @xmath49 s are stable when their separation is equal to or larger than @xmath27 , consistently with the result of the finite - width defects .",
    "the difference of the @xmath35 s of the @xmath106 and @xmath110 models implies that the stability of the planar defects is determined not only by the density of interstitial chains but also the arrangement of interstitial chains .",
    "planar defects containing isolated interstitial chains between @xmath56 units ( @xmath113 ) have higher formation energies than those without them at the same interstitial concentration .",
    "the energy gain by transformation of one of the eight - member rings to a seven - member ring is insufficient to change the relative stabilities of the planar defects .",
    "based on the @xmath35 of the planar defects listed in , we expect that the @xmath114 and @xmath115 planar defects to have comparable @xmath35 to the most stable planar defect , the @xmath106 model .",
    "the formation energy of the planar defects we have discussed is obtained without allowing relaxation of the supercells .",
    "a supercell relaxation would have generated the displacement vector ( burger vector ) around the core of the defects identified by tem observations .",

    "this result confirms that the @xmath124 model is more stable than the @xmath125 model .",
    "finally , the ability of the defects to capture or release interstitials is studied by calculating an energy required to add an interstitial to the bulk si in the presence of the planar defects ( ) .",
    "an interstitial is added at the hexagonal site at a distance of @xmath129 from the habit plane .",
    "the eight - member rings of the @xmath125 planar defect can provide efficient sinks of interstitials : the extra energy to add an interstitial to the @xmath125 planar defect decreases with decreasing @xmath129 , 3.2 ev at 16.5   and 1.5 ev at 10.1  .",
    "when the interstitial is added right above the eight - member ring ( 3.8   from the habit plane ) , about 0.1 ev energy is released . on the other hand ,",
    "an additional interstitial is not bounded by the @xmath106 planar defect .",
    "the energy required to add an interstitial is 4.7  5.1 ev .",
    "this energy is comparable to the formation energy of an isolated interstitial at the hexagonal sites and larger than that of the @xmath36 interstitialcy .",
    "these results support the calculations showing that the saturation of interstitials is achieved at the @xmath43 density about 67% in the @xmath106 structure ( ) .",
    "we have showed that interstitial chain structures elongated along the @xmath1 direction constitute the basic building blocks of the extended defects .",
    "this interstitial chain configuration is favored due to the minimum ratio of dangling bonds per interstitial and small distortions in bond angles and bond lengths .",
    "even finite - size interstitial chains , as small as 2-interstitial clusters , are found to be stable against isolated interstitials .",
    "a growth mechanism of the defects can be speculated from the dependence of the @xmath35 s on the dimensions of the defects and the interstitial concentrations .",
    "the growth of the defects would occur first by ( 1 ) elongation of interstitial chains along the @xmath1 direction and ( 2 ) the widening of the defects follows by capturing interstitial chains alongside the @xmath2 direction .",
    "we present an efficient mechanism , rotations of atoms on the @xmath3 plane , which can lead to propagation of interstitial chains .",
    "the planar rotation together with the interstitial chain structures can be applied to explain growth process of the defects and related structures such as the v - shape bend structure and atomic steps .",
    "we observed that the most stable arrangement of interstitial chains of the extended defects is @xmath130 and the optimal density of interstitial chains is 67% which is in a good agreement with the experimental value of 62% .",
