    "the neutrino oscillation experiments have proved that neutrinos are massive @xcite . however , the nature of neutrino masses is still one of the main puzzles in contemporary particle physics , _",
    "i.e. _ , are neutrinos dirac or majorana particles ? as we all known that the majorana mass term violates lepton number by two units ( @xmath0 = 2 ) .",
    "thus , the unambiguous answer to the question above is the experimental observation of a lepton - number violating ( lv ) process .",
    "various @xmath0 = 2 processes have been studied in the literature @xcite . among them",
    "@xcite have studied 36 lv processes from @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays , generically written by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 denote charged pseudoscalar mesons and leptons , respectively .",
    "most of these processes have been searched for and the non - observation in the current experiments set the bounds on branching fractions . in turn , they led to some stringent constrains on the mixing parameters between majorana neutrino and charged lepton directly . however , there are still more lv heavy meson decay modes that have not been studied experimentally , that may have sizable branching fractions in theory . in particular , heavy mesons ( with @xmath13 flavors )",
    "are easier to identify and the lhcb experiments will provide us with a large data sample . so as an extension of current existing calculations , we explore some new @xmath14 decay modes in this paper . we mainly consider the rare decays of heavy mesons @xmath15 and @xmath8 to vector meson final states . since the lv heavy meson decay modes under our consideration have no experimental results , we can not extract the mixing parameters through these decay channels like atre _ et al .",
    "_ did .    however , those processes considered by ali @xcite and atre @xcite are clearly correlated with the decay modes under our consideration , with the same mixing parameters specified by the charged lepton flavors .",
    "we thus adopt the numerical values of mixing parameters extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the decay widths and branching fractions of heavy mesons for our processes can be predicted correspondingly . we choose the strongest constrains on mixing parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite as input in our study , in order to be conservative .",
    "we mainly consider the heavy pseudoscalar meson @xmath7 and @xmath8 to vector meson final states . from theoretical point of view",
    ", the decays of vector mesons may have different and uncorrelated rates from that of the pseudoscalars if there is other type of new physics , like a heavy particle exchange of either a pseudoscalar / scalar or a vector boson .",
    "thus , it is well motivated to carry out the complementary searches for all of the availabel final states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "i.e. _ , the regions below the curve are the currently allowed branching fractions for those lv heavy meson decay modes in the table  .    from the figures , one can see that , if the heavy neutrino mass is located in the range from @xmath69 gev to @xmath70 gev , even with the most stringent constraints on mixing parameters , our theoretical predictions of upper bound of the branching fractions can be large , for example , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , since about @xmath74 @xcite events and @xmath75 @xcite events have been collected by cleo collaboration , these mentioned decay modes can be analyzed in the current experiment , which will provide us a strong information of @xmath69 gev to @xmath70 gev neutrino mass .",

    "finally , we calculated the decay widths and branching fractions for various lv decay modes by the limits on the mixing parameters and the heavy neutrino mass .",
    "we sampled the constraints on branching fractions as a function of the heavy neutrino mass as shown in the figures .",
    "although the prevailing theoretical prejudice prefers majorana neutrinos , the unambiguous signature to prove the majorana nature of neutrinos is the experimental detection of a lv process .",
    "a detection in one of the lv heavy meson decay modes studied in our analysis would imply lv and hence the existence of a majorana neutrino . at present , about @xmath80 @xcite events and @xmath81 @xcite events have been collected by cleo collaboration .",
    "so these decay modes @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 _ et al . _ which we studied in the table   might show up in the current experiments if the mass of the heavy neutrino is in the range @xmath85 .",
    "but those @xmath8 decay modes for the range of the heavy neutrino is @xmath86 can not be detected presently due to small branching fraction .",
    "fortunately , in the forthcoming lhc experiments , around @xmath87 @xmath8 meson events are expected @xcite , which will provide us with chances of discovering all the lv @xmath8 decays modes we studied .",
    "therefore , we may have the opportunity to discover the lv process of heavy mesons @xmath8 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 via the distinctive channels of like - sign dilepton production with no missing energy .",
