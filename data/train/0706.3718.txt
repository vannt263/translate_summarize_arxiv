    "new physics that affects the observability of the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) is of utmost importance to study .",
    "one the simplest kinds of new physics is a sequential replication of the three generations of chiral matter  @xcite .",
    "such a fourth generation has been considered and forgotten or discarded many times , wrongly leaving the impression that it is either ruled out or highly disfavored by experimental data ( for instance , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the status of four generations is more subtle  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite analyzed the contributions of one ( and more ) extra generations to the oblique parameters and explicitly found that one generation can be perfectly consistent with a heavy ( @xmath2  gev ) higgs . these significant results are primarily based on numerical scans , with emphasis on the role of a lighter neutrino ( @xmath3  gev ) to minimize the contributions to the oblique parameters ( see also ref .",
    "however , a neutrino with mass of @xmath3 gev , if unstable , is ruled out by lep ii bounds , while if it exactly stable , may be ruled out by dark matter direct search experiments @xcite . correlations of the mass parameters leading to viable spectra are certainly not transparent , making it hard to determine how to parse their results against present experimental bounds .",
    "subsequent analyses  @xcite studied the relationships among fourth generation parameters , but their analysis was performed using a global ( numerical ) fit to 2001 electroweak data and again emphasized a 50  gev neutrino .",
    "electroweak data has since been refined ( in particularly @xmath4 ) , so these results no longer obviously apply , in particular if we incorporate a heavier neutrino .",
    "the impact of a chiral fourth generation on higgs physics has been briefly discussed  @xcite , however the range of masses that were considered were not necessarily correlated to the fourth generation mass spectra and higgs mass appropriate to satisfy current direct search bounds and electroweak precision constraints . moreover , in cases where there is overlap , our results do not always agree ; we point out the differences below .    in this paper",
    ", we first systematically determine the allowed parameter space of fourth generation masses and mixings .",
    "we find quite simple mass relations that minimize the precision electroweak oblique parameters , so our analysis can easily be extended to future refinements in electroweak measurements .",
    "we then use typical spectra to compute the consequences for fourth generation particle production and decay , as well as the effects on the higgs sector of the standard model .",
    "we find that a wide range of higgs masses is consistent with electroweak data , leading to significant modifications of higgs production and decay .",
    "we outline the major effects , identifying the well - known effects from others that ( to our knowledge ) are new .",
    "there are in addition spectacular signals of the fourth generation itself .",
    "given that direct searches at lep ii and tevatron have already constrained the masses somewhat , we can expect future searches at tevatron will continue to push the limits up , but will not rule out four generations .",
    "the lhc is able probe heavy quarks throughout their mass range .",
    "many of the signals have been recently considered ( albeit in somewhat different mass ranges and context from what we consider here ) in refs .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the interested reader .",
    "the framework we consider is to enlarge the standard model to include a complete sequential fourth generation of chiral matter ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) as well as a single right - handed neutrino @xmath10 .",
    "yukawa couplings and right - handed neutrino masses are given by @xmath11 the generation indices are @xmath12 while we reserve @xmath13 for the standard model .",
    "su(2 ) contractions are implicit .",
    "light neutrino masses can arise from either a hierarchy in neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath14 or right - handed neutrino masses @xmath15 or some combination .",
    "( for an amusing combination , see ref .",
    "we mainly consider two possibilities for the fourth  generation neutrino mass : purely dirac ( @xmath16 ) and mixed ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "there are four obvious restrictions on a fourth generation : ( 1 ) the invisible width of the @xmath18 ; ( 2 ) direct search bounds ; ( 3 ) generational mixing ; ( 4 ) oblique electroweak effects .",
    "we now discuss them one - by - one .",
    "once a fourth  generation neutrino has a mass @xmath19 , the constraint from the invisible @xmath18 width becomes moot .",
    "assuming non - zero mixings @xmath20 or @xmath21 , the fourth  generation quarks , charged lepton , and neutrino decay , and thus there are no cosmological constraints from stable matter .",
    "( we will briefly comment on neutrino dark matter at the end the paper . )",
    "a robust lower bound on fourth  generation masses comes from lep  ii .",
    "the bound on unstable charged leptons is @xmath22  gev , while the bound on unstable neutral dirac neutrinos is @xmath23  gev for the decay modes @xmath24 .",
    "these limits are weakened only by about 10  gev when the neutrino has a majorana mass .",
    "because the small differences in the bounds between different flavors , charged versus neutral leptons , and majorana versus dirac mass do not affect our results , we apply the lep  ii bounds as @xmath25  gev throughout .",
    "the tevatron has significantly greater sensitivity for fourth  generation quarks  @xcite .",
    "the strongest bound is from the cdf search for @xmath26 , obtaining the lower bound @xmath27  gev to 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "no @xmath28-tag was used , so there is no dependence on the final  state jet flavor , and hence this limit applies independent of the ckm elements @xmath29 .",
    "there is no analogous limit on the mass of @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then the dramatic @xmath32 signal may be confused into the top sample .",
    "if the decay proceeds through a lighter generation , then the production rate and signal are the same as for @xmath6 , and so we expect a bound on the mass of @xmath7 similar to that on @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath33 , then @xmath7 decay could proceed through a `` doubly - cabbibo '' suppressed tree ",
    "level process @xmath34 or through the one - loop process @xmath35 .",
    "the relative branching ratios depend on details  @xcite .",
    "in particular , taking @xmath36 , cdf obtains the bound @xmath37  gev at 95% cl  @xcite we choose to adopt the largely ckm - independent bound @xmath38  gev throughout .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath39 of the ckm matrix @xmath40 are constrained by flavor physics .",
    "as in the standard model , the flavor - violating neutral current effects occur in loops and are automatically gim suppressed .",
    "rough constraints on the mixing between the first / second and fourth generation can be extracted requiring unitarity of the enlarged @xmath41 ckm matrix .",
    "the sm @xmath42 sub - matrix is well tested by a variety of sm processes  @xcite .",
    "the first row of the matrix , combined with measurements of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , yields @xmath46 for the second row we can use the hadronic @xmath47 branching ratio to obtain @xmath48 similarly , the first column of the matrix allows one to infer , @xmath49 if we require the above relations be satisfied to @xmath50 , we obtain @xmath51,@xmath52 .",
    "the remainder of the elements ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ) could be constrained through a global fit to the @xmath57 ckm matrix , including the contributions of the fourth  generation quarks to specific observables in loops ( for example @xcite ) , but this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "similarly there are two additional cp - violating phases in the @xmath41 ckm matrix , but since their effects are proportional to the unknown ( real parts ) of the off - diagonal ckm mixings , we ignore their effects .",
    "the least constrained sector is the mixing between the third and fourth generations .",
    "the observation of single top production  @xcite can be used to obtain a lower limit @xmath58 at @xmath1 c.l .",
    "@xcite , which still allows for large third / fourth generation mixing .",
    "thus it seems likely that fourth generation charged - current decays will be mostly into third generation quarks , provided the mass difference is large enough to permit two - body decays .",
    "the new elements in the pmns matrix @xmath59 also have constraints from lepton flavor violation in the charged and neutral sectors .",
    "the most stringent constraint is the absence of @xmath60 .",
    "for weak  scale purely dirac neutrinos this constraint  @xcite implies @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that first / second generation mixings with the fourth generation should be smaller than about @xmath62 .",
    "other generational mixings can also be constrained from the absence of lepton flavor violating effects , where again third / fourth generation mixings are ( as expected ) the most weakly constrained .",
    "there is , however , a significant constraint from neutrinoless double beta decay on @xmath63 in the presence of a weak  scale majorana mass @xmath64 . such a decay can be mediated by a very light neutrino mixing with a weak  scale ( partly ) majorana neutrino . using ref .",
    "@xcite and assuming only first / fourth generational mixing , we obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 and pmns phases are ignored .",
    "this expression is valid as long as the fourth  generation neutrino masses exceed the characteristic energy scale of the double  beta nuclear process , @xmath67  mev . inserting characteristic values , we obtain @xmath68 no bound remains once the fourth  generation majorana mass is made small , @xmath69  mev .",
    "the most pernicious effect of a fourth generation is the contribution to oblique electroweak corrections . @xmath70",
    "mixing is enhanced , leading to a positive contribution @xmath71 in the limit of degenerate isospin multiplets ( quark and lepton ) .",
    "degeneracy is usually assumed for simplicity since split doublets significantly contribute to the isospin violating parameter @xmath72 .",
    "there are three important effects that can mitigate the contribution to @xmath73 .",
    "the first , and most important , is exploiting the relative experimental insensitivity to the @xmath74 direction in oblique parameter space .",
    "we will be more precise below , but suffice to say slightly split electroweak doublets are in far better agreement with electroweak data than without the @xmath75 contribution .",
    "the second effect involves a reduced contribution to @xmath76 by splitting the fourth  generation multiplets in a particular mass hierarchy .",
    "the last , and least important effect is introducing a majorana mass for the fourth  generation neutrino .    splitting",
    "the up - type from down - type fermion masses in the same electroweak doublet can give a negative contribution to @xmath76 .",
    "in the large mass limit @xmath77 , the contribution to @xmath76 depends logarithmically on the ratio @xmath78  @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the hypercharge of the left - handed doublet of fermions with degeneracy ( color factor ) @xmath81 .",
    "clearly the fourth  generation contributions to @xmath76 are reduced if @xmath82 for quarks ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 for leptons @xmath85 .",
    "how big can this effect be given that split multiplets also contribute to @xmath75 ?",
    "( diagonal , blue ) and @xmath86 ( horizontal , red ) for the fourth  generation quarks .",
    "the plot is symmetric with respect to @xmath87 , since @xmath86 is positive definite .",
    "the tevatron bound @xmath38  gev excludes the shaded ( yellow ) region . ]    to calculate @xmath73 ( and @xmath75 and @xmath88 ) we use exact one - loop expressions which are valid for all @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "we checked our formulae by explicitly verifying finiteness ( renormalization scale independence ) as well as finding numerical agreement with several explicit results given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ quarksst - fig ] we show the size of the contribution from the @xmath90 doublet as a function of the masses of the quarks .",
    "the effect of using the exact one  loop expressions is modest ; in fact eq .",
    "( [ s - eq ] ) reproduces the @xmath76 contours up to an accuracy @xmath91 throughout the plot .",
    "the typical size of @xmath92 is smaller than @xmath62 everywhere , and so we set @xmath93 throughout .    for the leptons , what is most important is the split between the neutral and charged fermion masses . for example , @xmath94  gev implies @xmath95 , and the slightly larger values @xmath96  gev give @xmath97 .",
    "these results from the exact one - loop formulae agree surprisingly well with eq .",

    "fits of the combined electroweak data provide constraints on the oblique parameters and have been performed by the lep electroweak working group ( lep  ewwg )  @xcite and separately by the pdg  @xcite . both fits find that the standard model defined by @xmath99 with @xmath100  gev and @xmath101  gev is within @xmath50 of the central value ( always holding @xmath93 ) . however , the two fits disagree on the best ",

    "the actual numerical constraints derived from these measurements differ slightly between each group , presumably due to slight updates of data ( the @xmath76-@xmath72 plot generated by the 2006 lep  ewwg is one year newer than the plot included in the 2006 pdg ) . a larger difference concerns",
    "the use of the @xmath18 partial widths and @xmath109 .",

    ", higgs pair production is resurrected by fourth  generation loop effects . while the sm production rate at the lhc might barely be sufficient to confirm the existence of a triple higgs coupling @xmath120 as predicted by the higgs potential  @xcite",
    ", the enhancement of the effective @xmath121 and @xmath122 couplings should allow for a proper measurement of @xmath120 .",
    "enhancements to higgs pair production using an operator approach was also recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "total rates are notoriously difficult observables at hadron colliders , but the higgs self coupling can be beautifully extracted from the threshold behavior of the @xmath123 amplitude . at threshold , this process is dominated by the two form factors @xmath124 proportional to the metric tensor , which arise from the triangular and box diagrams ( following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the low  energy limit",
    "@xcite the box diagram s form factor proportional to the transverse tensor is suppressed by powers of the loop mass .",

    "more precisely , in the low  energy limit @xmath127 we find @xmath128 .",
    "this cancellation explains the increase in rate when we set @xmath120 to zero , as shown in table  [ tab : pairs ] .    if we only slightly vary the size of the higgs self coupling , this threshold behavior changes significantly  @xcite and provides an experimental handle on @xmath120 . in figure",
    "[ dihiggs - fig ] we show the @xmath129 invariant mass ( or @xmath130 at parton level ) distribution .",
    "the shift between finite and zero @xmath120 in the standard model provides the ( s)lhc measurement of the higgs self coupling .",
    "similarly to the @xmath121 form factors shown in table  [ tab : formfactors ] the decoupling assumption for top quarks is numerically not quite as good as for the additional fourth  generation quarks .",
    "once the process is dominated by heavier quarks the variation of @xmath131 with @xmath120 becomes significantly more pronounced , so there is little doubt that we can use it to measure the higgs self coupling .    for the standard model ,",
    "the higgs self coupling analysis at the lhc is likely restricted to the @xmath132 decay channel  @xcite . from table  [",
    "tab : pairs ] we see that for light higgs masses this decay is strongly suppressed , so it would be an interesting exercise to see if there are alternative decay channels  @xcite which might work for lighter higgs bosons , given the rate and @xmath131 sensitivity increase by the fourth generation .",
    "until now we have concentrated on collider effects of a fourth generation coupled to one higgs doublet . since the yukawa couplings of the new fermions exceed @xmath133 for the fourth  generation quarks , the four  generation model as an effective theory breaks down at a scale that may not be far above the tev scale .",
    "there are two well - known constraints : ( 1 ) the possibility that the quartic coupling is driven negative , destabilizing the electroweak scale by producing large field minima through quantum corrections  @xcite , and ( 2 ) large yukawa couplings driving the higgs quartic and/or the yukawas themselves to a landau pole , _",
    "i.e. _ entering a strong  coupling regime .    in both cases",
    "the problematic coupling is the higgs quartic , since it receives much larger new contributions to its renormalization group running from the fourth  generation quark yukawas couplings .",
    "the renormalization group equation for @xmath134 is @xmath135 where we have shown only the dominant terms .",
    "the last two terms encode the higgs wave function and quartic terms induced by the fermions ; the sum is over all identical fermions with degeneracy @xmath136 . in our numerical estimations",
    "we also include the sub - leading electroweak coupling dependence , and evolve using the full set of one loop @xmath137-functions  @xcite",
    ".    we can estimate the scale at which the meta - stability bound becomes problematic by requiring that the probability of tunneling into another vacuum over the current age of the universe is much less than 1 .",
    "this is equivalent to the requirement that the running quartic interaction is  @xcite @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the hubble scale .",
    "the scale at which this inequality is saturated is a minimum scale where new physics is required .",
    "we should emphasize that the new physics does _ not _ need to be strongly coupled .",
    "for example , a supersymmetric model with four generations does not have a running quartic that turns negative as long as superpartners are ( roughly ) below the tev scale .",
    "this is important because weakly coupled physics with particles obtaining their mass through _",
    "e.g. _ supersymmetry breaking , not electroweak breaking , will hardly affect our higgs results .    .",
    "these two constraints are qualitatively distinct : meta  stability can be restored by _",
    "weakly _ coupled physics below a tev scale , whereas the landau pole signals a strongly interacting higgs sector .",
    "the dashed curve reproduces the sm triviality bound . ]",
    "the second constraint is potentially a stronger one . requiring that the quartic remain perturbative , @xmath140",
    ", we find that the upper bound on the cutoff scale of the theory rapidly becomes small as the higgs mass is increased .",
    "we show this constraint as well as the meta - stability constraint in fig .",
    "[ stability - fig ] .",
    "we find that for our choices of fourth  generation masses , the yukawa interactions remain perturbative to slightly beyond the higgs meta - stability / triviality bounds for all considered higgs masses .",
    "the `` chimney '' region , in which the effective theory of the standard model with @xmath141 gev remains valid to @xmath142 , closes off .",
    "we find the maximal cutoff scale before new physics of any kind enters occurs for higgs masses in the neighborhood of 300  gev .",
    "much lower higgs masses , in particular @xmath143 , imply other new physics must enter to prevent developing a deeper minimum away from the electroweak breaking vacuum .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that this new physics can be weakly coupled below a tev with little effect on higgs physics itself .",
    "conversely , to resolve the physics of the cutoff scale in the case where the quartic ( or the yukawas ) encounter a landau pole undoubtedly requires physics directly connected to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this new physics could be stronger - coupled supersymmetry , technicolor , topcolor , or a little higgs construction .",
    "we have considered the constraints on a fourth generation and its effects on higgs physics in the standard model . if nature does indeed have a fourth generation , it is amusing to speculate on the rich series of new phenomena expected at colliders now operating and about to begin .",
    "the ordering of discoveries could proceed by tevatron discovering the higgs , with an unusually large production cross section , or in mass range that was previously thought to be undetectable in the standard model .",
    "subdominant decays of the higgs may reveal a new sector .",
    "direct production of fourth generation neutrinos or leptons may also be possible at tevatron , but relies on a more detailed understanding the background .",
    "once the lhc turns on , the fourth generation quarks should be readily produced and found .",
    "the higgs can be found using the golden mode for a wide range of mass , and for most of this range , it will be found very quickly with a small integrated luminosity ( due to the large enhancement of the gluon fusion channel ) . given measures of the cross section for higgs production as well as branching ratios of higgs into subdominant modes",
    ", the lhc will be able to rapidly verify that a fourth _ chiral _ generation does indeed exist .",
    "while our focus has been on the _ effects _ of a fourth generation , there is also the possibility that a fourth generation could alleviate or solve some of the pressing problems addressed by other models of new physics .",
    "one amusing possibility is to employ a variation of the mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite to revive electroweak baryogenesis in the ( four - generation ) standard model .",
    "another possibility is to impose a parity symmetry to stabilize the fourth generation lepton to serve as cold dark matter .",
    "this is naively ruled out by direct detection , however there are mechanisms @xcite to avoid these bounds by either splitting the neutrino eigenstates with a small majorana mass or otherwise invoking additional physics such as a @xmath144 coupling to @xmath145 .",
