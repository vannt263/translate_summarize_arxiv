    "however , in the interior of the wedges one solution decays exponentially and the linearly independent solution grows exponentially .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath10 are determined by requiring that the solution @xmath7 decay exponentially in two nonadjacent wedges .",

    "when the particle comes under the influence of a turning point , it usually executes a large number of nested u - turns and eventually returns back to its starting point .",
    "however , for some values of @xmath3 the complex trajectory may evade many turning points before it eventually encounters a turning point that takes control of the particle and flings it back to its starting point .",
    "@xcite conjectured that there may be special values of @xmath3 for which the classical path manages to avoid and sneak past all turning points .",
    "such a path would have an infinitely long period .",
    "we still do not know if such infinite - period orbits exist .    ref .",
    "@xcite did not explain why the period of a closed trajectory is such a wildly fluctuating function of @xmath3 .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that for special rational values of @xmath3 the trajectory bumps directly into a turning point that is located at a point that is the complex conjugate of the point from which the trajectory was launched .",
    "this turning point reflects the trajectory back to its starting point and prevents the trajectory from being @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "trajectories for values of @xmath3 near these special rational values have extremely different topologies and thus have periods that tend to be relatively long .",

    "having reviewed what is known about the classical situation , we come to the principal subject of this paper , which is to study what happens at the quantum - mechanical level ( that is , how the eigenvalues behave ) as @xmath3 increases through regions i , ii , and iii . in sec .  [ s2 ] we compare the classical and quantum theories for two cases , @xmath51 ( and @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 ) .",
    "our numerical studies show that the eigenvalues exhibit characteristic changes in behavior that correspond closely with the changes in behavior of the classical trajectories . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we make some concluding remarks .",
    "in refs .  @xcite and @xcite the behavior of the classical trajectories was studied and the period of the classical trajectories was found to have a remarkably complicated dependence on @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the eigenvalues for the corresponding eigenvalue problem for @xmath55 .",
    "( by the corresponding eigenvalue problem , we mean the eigenvalues for the eigenvalue problem associated with the @xmath51 and @xmath52 stokes wedges . )",
    "these eigenvalues were calculated by numerically integrating the schrdinger equation from large @xmath5 into the origin along the centers of the two stokes wedges and then applying the appropriate matching condition on @xmath7 and @xmath56 at @xmath57 . at the origin",
    "@xmath7 is continuous , but the matching condition on @xmath56 incorporates the angle of rotation between the two wedges .",
    "these matching conditions are reminiscent of the techniques used by m.  znojil in his discussion of  quantum toboggans \" @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues in fig .  [ fig4 ]",
    "exhibit the following features : at @xmath58 the spectrum is that of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , and the entire spectrum is real , positive , and discrete .",
    "as soon as @xmath3 increases from 0 , the eigenvalues begin to coalesce into complex conjugate pairs ; the process of combining into complex - conjugate pairs starts at the high - energy part of the spectrum .",
    "( this disappearance of real eigenvalues qualitatively resembles that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as @xmath3 decreases below 0 . )",
    "when @xmath3 reaches the value @xmath61 , only one real eigenvalue ( the ground - state eigenvalue ) remains .",
    "this eigenvalue becomes infinite at @xmath62 . between @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "there are no real eigenvalues at all .",
    "the real ground - state eigenvalue reappears when @xmath3 increases past @xmath65 , and as @xmath3 approaches @xmath66 , more and more real eigenvalues appear . at the isolated point",
    "@xmath67 the spectrum is again entirely real and agrees exactly with the spectrum in fig .  [ fig1 ] at @xmath67 . at the isolated point @xmath68 the spectrum is once again entirely real , but just above and below this value of @xmath3 the spectrum becomes complex again . finally , as @xmath3 reaches a value near @xmath69 , the spectrum is again entirely real , positive , and discrete and it remains so for all larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "note that some of the qualitative changes in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] occur at the same value of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the noisy fluctuations in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] begin at @xmath63 , just as the real ground - state eigenvalue blows up , and the fluctuations stop temporarily at @xmath64 , just as the real ground - state eigenvalue reappears in fig .",
    "the noisy classical fluctuations cease completely at @xmath67 , just as the real eigenvalues begin to reappear in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the most important qualitative changes in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] appear to be caused by the classical turning points entering and leaving the stokes wedges inside of which the eigenvalue problem is specified ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5lr ] ) . for the case",
    "@xmath51 the upper and lower edges of the wedge are given by @xmath70 at @xmath45 the @xmath51 classical turning point lies in the center of the wedge .",
    "however , as @xmath3 increases , the turning point rotates _ faster _ than the wedge rotates , and at @xmath63 this turning point leaves the wedge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5lr](a ) .",
    "there are no turning points in the wedge between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which corresponds with the total nonexistence of real eigenvalues . at @xmath64 a turning point re -",
    "enters the wedge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5lr](b ) , but this is the @xmath53 turning point and not the @xmath51 turning point . the re - entry of a classical turning point is strongly correlated with the reappearance of real eigenvalues .",
    "when the turning point leaves the wedge , wkb quantization is no longer possible .",
    "thus , the high - energy portion of the spectrum is no longer real .",
    "in fact , we believe that there are no eigenvalues at all , real or complex , when @xmath71 .      for a classical trajectory beginning at the @xmath53 turning point ,",
    "the period as a function of @xmath3 again exhibits three types of behaviors .",
    "the period decreases smoothly for @xmath72 ( region i ) .",
    "when @xmath73 ( region ii ) , the period becomes a rapidly varying and noisy function of @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath74 ( region iii ) the period is once again a smoothly decaying function of @xmath3 .",
    "these behaviors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the period in regions i and iii is very small compared with the period in region ii .",
    "the classical trajectory that begins at the @xmath53 turning point terminates at the @xmath54 turning point except when @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "broken - symmetry orbits occur at isolated points in region ii .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] displays the eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum problem .",
    "observe that the eigenvalues are all real at @xmath45 ( the harmonic oscillator spectrum ) , but they they begin to become complex as @xmath3 increases from @xmath26 .",
    "there are no real eigenvalues when @xmath3 reaches the value @xmath75 , just at the onset of noisy fluctuations in fig .",
    "there are several isolated values of @xmath3 at @xmath76 , @xmath66 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , where the spectrum is entirely real .",
    "there are also two regions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where there are no real eigenvalues at all . between @xmath76 and @xmath65",
    "there appears to be a patch where the eigenvalues are all ( or almost all ) real .",
    "( this patch corresponds with a temporary disappearance of noise in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "real eigenvalues begin to reappear at @xmath83 , and the spectrum appears to be completely real beyond @xmath84 .    the regions in which there are no real eigenvalues are exactly correlated with turning points leaving the stokes wedges . at @xmath85",
    "the @xmath53 classical turning point leaves the wedge at the angle @xmath86 .",
    "then , at @xmath87 the @xmath88 classical turning point enters the wedge at the angle @xmath89 .",
    "again , at @xmath68 the @xmath88 turning point leaves the wedge at the angle @xmath90 and at @xmath91 the @xmath92 classical turning point enters the wedge at the angle @xmath93 .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] for @xmath51 and figs .  [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] for @xmath53 illustrate a general pattern that appears to hold for all @xmath12 . for classical orbits that oscillate between the @xmath12th pair of turning points , there are always three regions , region i for which @xmath94 , region ii for which @xmath95 , and region iii for which @xmath96 . when @xmath45 , the turning points lie on the real axis in the centers of the stokes wedges . as @xmath3 increases ,",
    "the turning points rotate faster than the wedges rotate and they rotate out of the wedges at @xmath97 . at this point",
    "there is a patch where there are no real eigenvalues .",
    "as @xmath3 continues to increase , the @xmath98 turning point rotates into the stokes wedge and the eigenvalues begin to become real .",
    "eventually , this turning point leaves the wedge and there are again no real eigenvalues . in total , there are @xmath12 regions where there are no real eigenvalues .",
    "eventually , the @xmath99 turning point enters the wedge at the end of region ii , and the spectrum begins to become entirely real and remains entirely real in region iii .",
    "there are many isolated points at which the eigenvalues are all real .",
    "for example , when @xmath53 , real eigenvalues occur at @xmath76 , @xmath66 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "some of these points can be analyzed in terms of @xmath0 reflection . specifically : ( i ) from ( [ e3 ] ) we can see that at @xmath100 the @xmath53 wedge is centered at the angle @xmath101",
    ". the @xmath0 reflection of this wedge lies at the angle @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the @xmath53 spectrum agrees exactly with the @xmath18 spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for this value of @xmath3 .",
    "( ii ) at @xmath67 the @xmath53 wedge is centered at @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath0 reflection of this wedge is centered at @xmath104 , and under complex conjugation this angle becomes @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the @xmath53 spectrum is identical to the @xmath18 spectrum for this value of @xmath3 .",
    "this configuration of wedges is shown in fig .",
    "( iii ) at @xmath106 the @xmath53 wedge is centered at @xmath107 . under complex conjugation",
    ", this wedge is now centered at the angle @xmath108 , which corresponds with the wedge for the @xmath18 case .",
    "thus , once again , the spectra for these two problems are identical at this value of @xmath3 .",
    "( note that for these three situations @xmath3 is integer valued , and hence there is no cut in the complex-@xmath8 plane . )",
    "while quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are of course different theories with different regimes of applicability , our investigation has shown that there are nonetheless some correlations between the two .",
    "regular classical behavior seems to correspond to a completely real quantum spectrum , while chaotic classical behavior in the complex plane is associated with either a partially complex spectrum or a complete absence of eigenvalues . in the systems we have studied , the onset of rapid and irregular variation in the periods of the classical trajectories correlates precisely with the disappearance of all quantum eigenvalues as the ground - state energy goes to infinity , while the end of the noisy region is associated with the gradual reappearance of a completely real spectrum . within the region of rapid variation",
