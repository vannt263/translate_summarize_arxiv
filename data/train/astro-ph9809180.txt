    "there is growing evidence from recent radio and optical observations that the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) exhibits significant subparsec - scale variations down to limits of a few au ( frail _ et al_.   1994 ; davis _ et al_.  1996 ; meyer & blades 1996 ; watson & meyer 1996 ) . utilizing multi - epoch observations of 21 cm absorption towards high - velocity pulsars , frail _",
    "et al_.  find pervasive variations in the opacity on scales of 5 to 100 au with implied densities of @xmath5 .",
    "probing larger scales ( 500 - 30,000 au ) through optical observations of the interstellar absorption towards a number of resolved binary star systems , watson & meyer ( 1996 ) also found a ubiquitous pattern of small interstellar structures and inferred densities of @xmath6 in some structures . due to their large overpressures with respect to the intercloud medium",
    ", such structures can not be accommodated in any abundance in the standard mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) model of the ism .",
    "possible explanations for these structures range from small - scale filamentary geometries ( heiles 1997 ) , to fractal geometries driven by turbulence ( elmegreen 1997 ) , to a separate population of small , dense self - gravitating clouds ( walker & wardle 1998 ) .",
    "an important point discussed by heiles ( 1997 ) is that the high volume densities of the small - scale structures have not been measured directly  they have been inferred by dividing the observed column density differences by the sampled transverse length scales .",
    "furthermore , in the case of the observations , since is not the dominant ion in clouds it may not be a reliable tracer of column density differences , especially at low column densities ( welty , hobbs , & kulkarni 1994 ) . in this _ letter _ , we present _ hst _ ghrs echelle observations of the interstellar absorption for , , , and towards both members of the binary @xmath0 cru ( meyer & blades 1996 ) in the first effort to apply uv interstellar diagnostics towards an understanding of the physical conditions in the structures giving rise to the observed small - scale variations .",
    "in addition , we present new high - resolution observations of this binary that afford a temporal probe of the ism structure at a scale similar to that sampled by frail _",
    "et al_.  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 cru binary system consists of a b2iv - v and a b5ve star at a distance of 170 pc with a separation of 38.8 ( corresponding to a projected linear separation of 6600 au or 0.03 pc ) .",
    "both stars were observed using the _ hst _ goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) .",
    "four wavelength intervals were covered using the high resolution echelle gratings ( ech - a near 1271 , and ech - b near 2026 , 2062 , and 2852 ) to observe lines of , , , and at a resolution of @xmath43.5 km / sec .",
    "the data were taken in fp - split mode , the calibrated data files as delivered by stsci were coadded in the usual fashion using the stsdas tasks poffsets , dopoff , and specalign . for the rapidly rotating star @xmath3 cru",
    "the continuum was fitted using low - order polynomials . for @xmath1 cru continuum",
    "fitting was more difficult due to the low @xmath7 ( 48 km / sec ) . here",
    "smaller regions of the spectrum were fitted using higher - order polynomials ; the resulting profile for each line was then compared to the other line of the same species towards @xmath1 cru ( and the same line towards @xmath3 cru ) to be sure that the continuum was properly placed and that the entire interstellar line was excluded from the fit .",
    "the resulting profiles are shown in figure  1 ; note that the variation is largely confined to the lines of the neutral species , with no significant variations in the or profiles .",
    "the interstellar d2 absorption was re - observed with the ultra - high resolution facility ( uhrf ) on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) towards both members of the @xmath0 cru binary star system in march 1997 , 21 months after the first observations reported by meyer & blades ( 1996 ) .",
    "a tek 1024@xmath81024 ccd was used for these observations ; the data was then processed using a combination of figaro and iraf routines .",
    "the spectrograph configuration for these observations is the same as that described in meyer & blades ( 1996 ) ; the resulting resolution was @xmath9 .",
    "according to the _ hipparcos _ catalog , the proper motion of these stars is @xmath10/year ( esa 1997 ) , corresponding to a projected change in position of @xmath11 au over the 21 month period between observations .",
    "as shown in figure  2 , the line profiles are virtually identical ; in addition , the column densities , b - values , and relative velocities of the various components derived by profile fitting are well within the calculated errors .",
    "the striking lack of change in the d2 profile implies a minimum cloudlet size of a few tens of au .",
    "this result is not necessarily inconsistent with the @xmath12 au structures found by frail _",
    "et al_.  ( 1994 ) , but suggests that further monitoring of this sight - line would be worthwhile .",
    "the narrow , hyperfine - split absorption observed in at -8.6 km / sec towards @xmath1 cru provides an opportunity to derive the physical conditions in a relatively isolated component .",
    "in particular , the components at 4.4 and 5.0 km / sec ( which appear to be strongly enhanced towards @xmath3 cru ) are severely blended at the resolution of the ghrs echelle gratings , and thus any interpretation of these components is more ambiguous .",
    "profile fitting was used to derive the column densities listed in table  1 for the -8.6 km / sec component .",
    "the most remarkable aspect of these numbers is the enhancement over typical ism values of the columns of the neutral species relative to the observed towards @xmath1 cru , despite the similarity of the columns .",
    "since is the dominant ion in typical clouds , and zn is relatively undepleted ( sembach _ et al_. 1995 ; roth & blades 1995 ) , it is a direct measure of the column  the lack of variation in the profile implies that the variation in and the other neutrals is occurring without a change in the column .",
    "these observations suggest that we may be seeing a small `` core '' in the cloud at -8.6 km / sec where the neutrals vary , but where any variation in the ( and hence ) column is masked by a broader component with no associated neutral gas .",
    "we will now explore the physical conditions in this cloud , as well as several potential explanations for the variations , and show that small - scale density and temperature fluctuations in a diffuse interstellar cloud are the most likely explanation for the observed neutral enhancements towards @xmath0 cru .",
    "since @xmath3 cru is a known be star , one must consider the possibility that the variations in absorption line profiles arise in circumstellar gas around one or both members of the system , but there is strong evidence that this gas is indeed interstellar in nature .",
    "the narrow , hyperfine split components observed to vary between the members of the @xmath0 cru system arise in cold gas , and it is difficult to imagine an environment near these b stars in which such cold clumps would arise .",
    "the lack of time - variability in the d2 absorption profiles also argues against a circumstellar explanation since an expanding circumstellar shell gas would be likely to shift or vary in strength over this period .",
    "finally , the lack of strong @xmath13 ( and @xmath14 ) absorption in the -8.6 km / sec component implies that the radiation field can not be much larger than @xmath15 times the diffuse ultraviolet background ( jenkins & shaya 1979 ) ; calculations show that the observed n(@xmath13)/n(@xmath16 ) ratio of @xmath17 0.25 requires that this structure lies at least 1 pc from the b2v star @xmath1 cru .",
    "we can estimate the hydrogen column density , and hence the density for this component using the measured uncertainties in the zn column ( towards both members of the system ) as a rough upper limit to the column of in the structure giving rise to the variation .",
    "we place a 2@xmath18 upper limit on any enhancement at -8.6 km / sec of towards @xmath1 cru of @xmath19 . for typical interstellar depletions",
    "this corresponds to n()@xmath20 ( sembach _ et al_. 1995 ; roth & blades 1995 ) , which is less than 40% of the value one would estimate from the observed column .",
    "given the binary separation of 6600 au , this implies that the observed variation may arise in a structure with a density contrast of @xmath21 , which is appreciably less than that estimated in previous studies of small - scale ism structure .",
    "however , note that 6600 au is only an upper limit to the size of the structure , and a smaller structure would have a higher density .",
    "therefore , we now refine this simple argument using the available data for the neutral species to directly estimate the density without assuming a characteristic length scale .",
    "first , we can place an upper limit on the hydrogen density using the fine - structure equilibrium of .",
    "given the measured ratio of n(@xmath13)/n(@xmath16)@xmath170.25 , we can place a strict upper limit to the density for cloud temperatures @xmath22  k of @xmath23 ( jenkins & shaya 1979 ) . for a more typical interstellar cloud temperature of @xmath24  k",
    "the density would be @xmath25 , which is ( again ) substantially lower than the densities estimated for small - scale structures in previous studies .",
    "this limit is independent of any estimate of the cloud size .",
    "the measured columns of the neutral species can be combined with ionization and recombination coefficients to derive estimates of the density in this structure .",
    "if we take as a surrogate for the ( unobserved ) first ions of carbon , sodium , and magnesium , we can estimate the required columns by assuming solar abundance ratios and a variety of depletions ( ranging from no depletion to typical cold cloud values ) .",
    "pquignot & aldrovandi ( 1986 ) have calculated ionization and recombination coefficients as a function of temperature and electron density for four choices of radiation field , including that of witt & johnson ( 1973 ) . for a temperature of 100  k and an assumed @xmath26 ratio of @xmath27 ( from the ionization of carbon )",
    ", we can estimate @xmath28 using our observed columns ( see table  1 ) .",
    "first , to minimize the neutral fraction for c , na , and mg we will use the total observed column at -8.6 km / sec in these estimates .",
    "then , for no depletion , we derive @xmath29 , 120 , and 190 @xmath30 from , , and respectively . for a typical cold cloud depletion pattern ( savage & sembach 1996 )",
    ", we estimate densities of @xmath31 , 240 , and 620 @xmath30 respectively .",
    "note that the densities estimated from and are consistent in both cases , but that the density is apparently over - estimated for if we assume cold cloud depletions .",
    "if the upper limit of n()@xmath32 estimated above is used , densities of @xmath33 , 425 , and 540 @xmath30 are found assuming no dust depletion .",
    "these density estimates imply cloud sizes of @xmath4 350  4,000 au , which are comparable to the cloud size limits of 10 and 6600 au set by the optical observations .",
    "the agreement between the estimated cloud sizes and the observed limits is suggestive , but note that there is an implicit assumption that there is little or no ionized hydrogen in this structure .",
    "if some fraction of the hydrogen is ionized the density in the structure will be lower ; however , as the ionized fraction increases , the hydrogen column in the structure must decrease so as not to exceed the limit on the cloud size set by the binary separation .",
    "now in addition to being density sensitive , the ratios of the columns of neutrals to first ions is also sensitive to the temperature . for , , and",
    "the column density goes roughly as @xmath34 ( pquignot & aldrovandi 1986 ) , thus a difference in temperature of a factor of 100 would lead to a difference in the columns of the neutrals of a factor of @xmath15 , a value consistent with the observed upper limit for at this velocity towards @xmath3 cru .",
    "however , the profile fits to the lines towards both stars yield similar b - values for both lines - of - sight suggesting that the temperature of the bulk of the material in these clouds is similar and of order a few hundred degrees k ( given @xmath35@xmath36 km / sec ) , although the presence of a somewhat narrower colder `` core '' towards @xmath1 cru can not be ruled out .",
    "since the 21 cm opacity scales as @xmath37 , it seems at first glance that temperature fluctuations alone could explain the observed variation in both the neutral and the 21 cm lines .",
    "but as noted by heiles ( 1997 ) , such extreme temperature fluctuations are difficult to understand for a number of reasons .",
    "this suggests that temperature fluctuations are likely to play at least some role in producing the observed neutral variations , although it is unlikely to be the sole mechanism involved .",
    "thus , a plausible model for the absorbing clumps is that we are detecting a small , somewhat denser and colder core towards @xmath1 cru that is embedded in a larger cloud seen towards both stars .",
    "there are a number of similarities and differences between the properties of the -8.6 km / sec cloudlet towards @xmath1 cru and the structures observed in radio studies .",
    "the most direct comparisons can be made with the pulsar study of frail _ et al_. ( 1994 ) as it is also a multi - epoch study of absorption against a background point - source .",
    "the scales sampled in these studies are similar , thus the lack of variation observed towards both members of the @xmath0 cru system is somewhat surprising given the ubiquity of the variations observed in the pulsar study , but is not inconsistent with the inferred cloud sizes .",
    "the lack of variation in the observed profiles between the stars suggests that there is little or no variation in the total hydrogen column density towards @xmath0 cru , which appears to be at odds with the large variations observed in the radio studies .",
    "the upper limit for the density in this structure is significantly different from the values estimated from the 21 cm observations , which typically imply much larger densities in ( perhaps ) smaller clouds .",
    "one explanation is that perhaps this gas is associated with one of the heiles ( 1997 ) filaments or sheets observed roughly `` face - on '' , our estimate for the size of the structure would then be an estimate for the thickness of the filament / sheet ( with the width of the structure being constrained by the 6600 au binary separation ) .",
    "a large variation in the column density could be measured if the filament / sheet was along the line - of - sight instead of perpendicular to it .",
    "this sort of density fluctuation is also consistent with a fractal ism model ( such as those of elmegreen 1997 ) , since density as well as column density inhomogeneities can be a natural outcome of turbulent processes .    what , if any , fraction of the cloudlets detected as variations are associated with the structures responsible for the 21 cm variations towards radio sources is still uncertain .",
    "further observations of multiple star systems with variable ( in both lightly and more highly reddened sight - lines ) using _ hst_/stis and _ fuse _ are required for a fuller understanding of the physical conditions in the variable components , and to ( potentially ) identify components which show large column density differences similar to the 21 cm studies . if no such components are found",
    ", then this suggests that the and 21 cm studies are identifying different structures .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge several valuable conversations with the late lyman spitzer , with mark wardle about extreme scattering events , and with dan welty about the ionization equilibrium of neutral species .",
    "in addition , we would like to thank the anonymous referee for their suggestions ."
